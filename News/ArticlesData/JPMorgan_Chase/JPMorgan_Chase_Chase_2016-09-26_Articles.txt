Here's how much the top Wall Street banks have earned in fees this year Portia Crowe Sep. 26, 2016, 9:16 AM 17,733 facebook linkedin twitter email print JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. JPMorgan has pulled in more fees than any other investment bank this year.Reuters JPMorgan is leading the pack when it comes to Wall Street dealmaking revenues, according to Dealogic's preliminary league tables for the first nine months of the year.  Altogether, global investment banking revenue was down 14% from the same period last year. That is improvement on the first half, where revenues came in 16% lower than the previous years. League tables are a contentious subject on Wall Street. Banks use them when pitching for new business, and a good ranking means serious bragging rights. But the league table-data can also be sliced up to make a bank's performance look better (by narrowing the field very narrowly, for example).   Though they're based on estimates, these tables are the broadest possible and a closely-watched indicator of who is up and who is down.  Here's how the banks stacked up this time around. View As: One Page Slides JPMorgan ranked first for overall investment banking revenues Dealogic JPMorgan has a 8.1% market share and $4.1 billion in total revenues for the year to September 26. It was followed by rival Goldman Sachs, with $3.4 billion and a 6.8% share. Bank of America was in third place, with $3.2 billion. Global investment banking revenue was $50.7 billion for the first nine months of 2015, which was down 14% compared to the same period last year. JPMorgan also ranked first for revenue in debt capital markets Dealogic JPMorgan has made $1.1 billion in revenue in debt capital markets, giving it an 6.9% share. Bank of America followed, with $1.1 billion in fees, and Citi raked in $923 million to place third. Global DCM volumes hit the $5 trillion earlier this month, putting 2016 on track to beat the 2006 full year record high of $6.62 trillion. And in equity capital markets Dealogic JPMorgan had a 8% share in equity capital markets, followed by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Global equity capital markets volumes, at $512.7 billion, was the lowest since 2012.  Goldman Sachs was the winner for M&A revenues Dealogic Goldman Sachs is well ahead of its rivals in M&A with $1.8 billion in revenues, versus JPMorgan's $1.5 billion and Morgan Stanley's $1.3 billion. Global M&A stands $2.5 trillion, down 24% from the same period a year ago.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch scored first place in syndicated loans. Dealogic Bank of America Merrill Lynch pulled in $798 million for arranging syndicated loan deals, versus JPMorgan's $745 million and Credit Suisse's $548 million.

 JPMorgan just promoted a rising star in its biggest business Matt Turner Sep. 27, 2016, 5:36 PM 23,260 facebook linkedin twitter email print JPMorgan JPMorgan just announced a change at the top of its consumer banking business. The US bank has named Thasunda Duckett as CEO of the consumer bank, reporting to Gordon Smith, CEO of consumer and community banking. "T is an extraordinary leader and talent," Smith said in a memo announcing the appointment. "For anyone who knows T, you know she has both great IQ and EQ." The new role puts Duckett, who was previously CEO of Chase Auto Finance, at the heart of JPMorgan's biggest business. Consumer and community banking generated $11.5 billion in revenue in the second quarter, with $2.7 billion in net income. Duckett replaces Barry Sommers, who is moving to a new unit called Wealth Management and Investment Solutions. That unit will combine the wealth management businesses across asset management and consumer and community banking, according to a separate memo from Mary Erdoes, CEO of asset management at JPMorgan. Sommers will become CEO of wealth management, while Brian Carlin will become CEO of investment and banking solutions. Carlin will also oversee the bank's digital wealth management and institutional wealth management business.  SEE ALSO: Bank of America has officially crowned one of the most senior women in finance NOW WATCH: Here’s what happens when interest rates go negative Loading video...

Chauncey Lennon is the head of workforce initiatives at JP Morgan Chase. He says workers need to have so-called "soft skills", like teamwork and communication. But many of today's in-demand jobs also require greater technical expertise.  "When we think about some of the growing and strong sectors in Detroit, things like information technology, manufacturing, healthcare, advanced manufacturing, transportation and logistics, all of those, you don't necessarily need a four-year degree, but you do typically need some sort of post-secondary training." The money will go to local training partners to help develop programs to teach the skills employers need workers to have, while also making jobs and training more accessible to people in Detroit.  The Corporation for a Skilled Workforce, the Detroit Employment Solutions Corporation and the United Way for Southeast Michigan will all receive a portion of the $1.3 million. Lennon says it's important that workforce training programs work both with employers and Detroit residents to be best effective.  "At the same time that we're trying to meet the needs of employers, we're also trying to build these strong career pathways. So all Detroiters understand how they can begin to develop the skills, so they have opportunities over time to build up their skills, (and) they're able to find good jobs in these growing sectors." Lennon credits Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan's office, local training providers and business owners for working to build a training network in Detroit that focuses on helping more workers learn in-demand skills. One of the challenges facing these training programs is finding a way to make sure Detroit residents actually get involved. Lennon says not everyone is ready to dive into intensive on-the-job training. Introductory training programs therefore are an important part of the solution. The Detroit Employment Solutions Corporation will use the money to develop pre-apprenticeships designed to teach workers fundamental skills, while opening the door to more opportunity. Similarly, the United Way of Southeast Michigan focuses on construction and manufacturing industries, and training new workers through their "Access for All" program.  According to Lennon, workforce training is a critical component of sustaining Detroit's economic growth. "A key piece of how we continue to support Detroit is to have a strong, demand-driven workforce system," Lennon said.  Tags:  Detroit united way Mayor Mike Duggan TweetShareGoogle+Email Related Content 'More and better jobs in Michigan': Gov.

JPMorgan reiterated its Overweight rating on AMZN and lifted its price target from $925 to $1,000, citing strong growth catalysts in the company’s electronics, general merchandise, media, and services segments. That new price target suggests a 25% upside to the stock’s Monday closing price of $799.16. “We believe Amazon continues to show strong ability to take share of overall eCommerce, and its flexibility in pushing first-party versus third-party inventory is a major advantage compared with other retailers,” said the firm in a research note to clients this morning. Related: See what ETFs own the most AMZN stock Just ten weeks ago, JPMorgan set a $908 price target on AMZN. The stock has gained 6% since then, prompting the firm to boost its target to $925 in late July, and now $1,000 today. Amazon has serious growth potential in many avenues. Its Prime subscription service is doing better than all other membership services, and it could be a short time away from becoming a shipping company to rival UPS and FedEx. It’s also seeing huge growth on the retail side in overseas markets. Amazon shares rose $3.34 (+0.42%) to $802.50 in premarket trading Tuesday. Year-to-date, AMZN has gained 18.24%, versus a 5% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 during the same period.

Here is something that you might not be aware of; many credit cards offer a feature called price protection.  The exact details vary by Issuer but the general idea is that after you make a purchase, for a specific and limited period of time  up to 50 or even 80 days depending on which card issuer you go with), your credit card company will refund the difference if your purchase drops in price. Very few people take advantage of this feature because a) they probably don’t know the feature exists and b) no one has time to constantly monitor price changes. Let’s begin by tackling issue #1 Our friends at CardRatings have compiled a list of credit cards that offer price protection so go here to find out if your card offers this feature. And if you don’t have a card that offers price protection you might want to check out the Chase Freedom card. What is the Chase Freedom card? Chase Freedom offers price protection as well as 5% cash back on select categories. From now until Sept 30th you can get 5% cash back on purchases made at restaurants as well as purchases made at wholesale clubs like Costco.  So you can sleep easy knowing that you’re getting 5% cash back on your toilet paper purchases, and if the price drops, you’re covered!  And if that wasn’t good enough, on October 1st the 5% cash back category “switches” to Holiday Shopping, and while the exact details have not been released, price protection coupled with 5% cash back is a pretty enticing offer to minimize holiday shopping buyer’s remorse. In other words, the Chase Freedom has you covered. Now that you have a card that offers price protection how do you take advantage of the feature? Enter Paribus.  Paribus is an app that will detect the receipts in your mailbox and track your purchases and monitor price drops, missed coupons and price match opportunities to save you money. If a price drops, Paribus will check it against the issuer’s policies and communicate with their customer service on your behalf to get you paid. A card that offers price protection coupled with the Paribus app can really save people some money.  Now that you are in the know, leave a comment in the space below if this worked for you and let us know how much money you saved.

Business ‘King of mining’ Ian Hannam digs up profits despite industry gloom Jamie Nimmo Tuesday 27 September 2016 13:06 BST Sales leap: Hannam & Partners saw turnover rise 37% to £7.4 million in the 12 months ended March Jorge Mu-Oz/Getty Images Ian Hannam, the former JPMorgan rainmaker who was fined for market abuse, saw profits leap at his new corporate finance boutique, despite a dearth of natural resources deals. Turnover rose 37% to £7.4 million and pre-tax profits rose from £570,000 to £2.4 million in the 12 months ended March, accounts for Hannam & Partners filed at Companies House show. Chief executive Neil Passmore, the former JPMorgan colleague of the so-called “King of Mining”, said profits were re-invested by the company’s partners, who include Hannam and veteran City broker Tim Hoare. The firm’s biggest public deals included advising on the £135 million takeover of Asia Resource Minerals, the Indonesian miner formerly known as Bumi, and Worldview’s equally divisive buyout of Irish oil explorer Petroceltic. Much of its business is raising capital for private clients. Hannam, a former Territorial Army captain who earned a reputation for arranging huge mining deals including Glencore’s tie-up with Xstrata, was fined £450,000 by the Financial Services Authority in 2012 for giving insider information on Heritage Oil to Kurdistan’s oil minister. He resigned from JPMorgan in 2012 and bought Strand Partners the same year before rebranding it Hannam & Partners. Passmore said the business was “in good shape” in a market where “a lot of our competitors blew up last year”, referring to the closure of GMP Securities’ London office and job cuts for Canaccord Genuity. “In relative terms we’re very happy we’re weathering the downturn and building a brand when others are failing to do so. In absolute terms, I was frustrated that the business stayed stuck in the same kind of modest revenue zone,” he said. Passmore said trading in the six months since March had been “much better”.

Yet the executives' participation in this year's biggest initial public offering also serves as a reminder that investing in Chinese banks isn't what it used to be. PHOTO: REUTERS Sep 27, 2016 7:49 PM [SHANGHAI] Jamie Dimon and Sergio Ermotti starred in the roadshow promoting Postal Savings Bank of China Co's share sale. Yet the executives' participation in this year's biggest initial public offering also serves as a reminder that investing in Chinese banks isn't what it used to be. When China's fifth-largest bank priced its US$7.4 billion share sale last week, UBS and JPMorgan snared 5 per cent paper gains on investments made nine months earlier. The shares will start trading in Hong Kong on Wednesday after being priced near the bottom of a marketed range. Bank of America Corp and Goldman Sachs Group Inc more than doubled their money with China Construction Bank Corp and Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd stakes respectively in 2005 and 2006 before those firms' shares started trading. History is failing to repeat itself as investors fret at the risks weighing down Chinese lenders. JPMorgan's first purchase of a stake in one of the biggest Chinese lenders came a decade after a wave of bank IPOs in China generated multibillion-dollar windfalls for foreign banks. Goldman and Bank of America bought in before the global financial crisis when the Chinese economy was booming and sold after post-crisis banking rules made it more expensive to hold minority stakes. In a video played at roadshow briefings in Hong Kong and London, Mr Dimon, 60, and Mr Ermotti, 56, highlighted "strategic" tie-ups with Postal Savings Bank. JPMorgan will provide advice for the Chinese lender's retail finance business and help it to bolster trade finance capabilities, while UBS will aid efforts to provide wealth management services, according to the share sale prospectus. Spokesmen for JPMorgan, which is among joint sponsors of the IPO, and UBS, the sole financial adviser to the offering, declined last week to comment further. Ten strategic investors put 45.1 billion yuan (S$9.2 billion) into the bank in December. UBS accounted for the largest share at 13.3 billion yuan, while JPMorgan took a 2.5 billion yuan stake. UBS could syndicate a significant portion of its stock to other investors, people familiar with the matter said ahead of the purchase. Global investors have become increasingly concerned that a rising tide of bad loans will threaten banks and the economy. While the lender's stock was priced near the low end, its valuation as measured by its price-to-book ratio is higher than those of other big state lenders. The stock fell as much as 2.3 per cent to HK$4.65 on Tuesday in a grey market operated by Phillip Securities Group. "I won't be surprised if Postal Savings Bank's shares fall below the IPO price on their debut," said Li Bin, a Shanghai- based analyst at Capital Securities Corp. "Their strategic investors must look at the deal from a very, very long-term perspective, betting they will be compensated by something else - such as extra local government support for their own China businesses." UBS made a pre-IPO gain of about 160 per cent in nine months on a US$492 million investment in Bank of China Ltd in 2005. The Swiss lender reaped about 35 percent on paper when a "bad bank" - China Cinda Asset Management Co, a manager of nonperforming loans - priced its initial share offer in 2013. Bank of America reaped 110 per cent in two months from buying a US$2.5 billion holding in China Construction Bank. Goldman Sachs more than doubled the value of its US$2.6 billion stake in Industrial & Commercial Bank of China in six months. The gain was one of the firm's biggest investment wins since being founded in 1869, people with knowledge of Goldman's investments said at the time. Those investments were made "during the golden age of the Chinese economy," said Richard Cao, a Shenzhen-based analyst at Guotai Junan Securities Co. "Now, it's a different time, so that kind of return is not realistic." The global financial institutions that spent US$33 billion buying stakes in Chinese lenders from 2001 and 2009 mostly later exited - leaving the likes of HSBC Holdings Plc, with its shareholding in Bank of Communications Co. Goldman Sachs earned about US$12 billion in sales proceeds and dividends from its seven-year investment in ICBC, while Bank of America reaped at least US$15 billion after buying in to Construction Bank. The strategic investors in Postal Savings Bank face a three-year lock-up on their investments. Ubiquitous in small-town China with 500,000 customers, the bank is the last major state-controlled lender to sell stock publicly to fund expansion. In a sign of what's changed, Chinese bank shares have lagged behind the benchmark Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong for five of the past six years while their profit growth has slumped to the lowest level in a decade. While Postal Savings Bank's strengths include an extensive network, a strong deposit base, and a non-performing loan ratio less than half that of the industry as a whole, it also has weaknesses. In a note this month, analysts at Sanford C Bernstein & Co highlighted inefficiencies, concentrated lending - including a large exposure to the cash-burning China Railway Corp - and increased shadow-banking exposures, such as investments in asset management plans. Adding to concerns about the industry, a Bank for International Settlements warning gauge for banking stress rose to a record in China in the first quarter, after an explosion in credit since the global crisis. At the same time, the government's control of the banking system and of the levers of economic policy may limit the risk of a Chinese financial crisis.

The study finds that women fall behind early and face ever-greater challenges the more senior they become. Women are less likely to receive the first critical promotion to manager—so far fewer end up on the path to leadership—and they are less likely to be hired into more senior positions. As a result, the higher you look in companies, the fewer women you see. "When women are stuck, corporate America is stuck," said Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook COO and founder of LeanIn.Org. "We know that diverse teams perform better and inclusive workplaces are better for all employees, so we all have strong incentives to get this right." The Women in the Workplace 2016 report is part of an ongoing partnership between McKinsey & Company and LeanIn.Org to give companies the information they need to promote female leadership and foster gender equality in the workplace. The study is based on pipeline data and information on human resources practices from 132 companies that employ more than 4.6 million people, including Visa, MetLife, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Procter & Gamble, Facebook, and General Motors. In addition, more than 34,000 employees completed a survey designed to explore their experiences regarding gender, opportunity, career, and work-life issues. The study builds on the Women in the Workplace 2015 report and a baseline study of sixty companies conducted by McKinsey & Company in 2012. "To accelerate progress on gender parity, we first must understand what is holding women back," said Dominic Barton, global managing partner of McKinsey & Company. "This study seeks to do exactly that. It provides companies with both industry benchmarks and data on their own talent pipeline and employees' work experiences. These insights will help companies drive bolder and more effective solutions." Contrary to conventional wisdom, this year's study found that women negotiate for promotions and raises as often as men, but face pushback when they do. They are far more likely than men who negotiate to receive feedback that they are "intimidating," "too aggressive," or "bossy." Women also receive informal feedback less frequently than men—despite asking for it as often—and have less access to senior-level sponsors. So not surprisingly, women are almost three times more likely than men to think their gender will make it harder to get a raise, promotion, or chance to get ahead. The study found that, compared to white women, women of color face the most barriers and experience the steepest drop-offs with seniority despite having higher aspirations for becoming a top executive. Women of color also report they get less access to opportunities and see a workplace that is less fair and inclusive. They are 9% less likely to say they've received a challenging new assignment, 21% less likely to think the best opportunities go to the most deserving employees, and 10% less likely to feel comfortable being themselves as work. Although company commitment to gender diversity is at an all-time high, companies are struggling to put their commitment into practice. Less than half of employees say their company is doing what it takes to improve diversity, and many employees do not see gender diversity as a personal priority. The report identifies concrete steps companies can take to advance their gender diversity efforts. They can make a stronger case for gender diversity, explaining why it matters and how it benefits everyone. They can also ensure their hiring, promotion, and performance review polices are fair, and invest in training so employees know the steps they can take to promote gender diversity. And they can place more emphasis on accountability and set gender targets so it's easier to track and make progress. The complete Women in the Workplace 2016 report, including detailed findings and recommendations, is available at womenintheworkplace.com. From the website, organizations can download the report and sign up to participate in this ongoing research. QUOTES FROM PARTICIPATING CEOS Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co."At JPMorgan Chase, we foster a diverse and inclusive workplace where everyone can thrive. We believe it's not only the smart thing to do, it's the right thing to do and it's also good for business. We've implemented a number of initiatives aimed at helping make sure women advance and achieve their career goals at our company. This study will help us continue to build on the momentum we've attained." Charles Scharf, CEO of Visa"At Visa, advancing diversity and inclusion is a strategic imperative. Data from this Women in the Workplace study has reaffirmed the reality that there is still a lot more work to be done in both investing in and advancing women in the workplace. Dialogue is critical, along with swift action. As one of several initiatives we have in place to advance this discussion, Visa recently joined a consortium that brings together companies who are as committed as we are to addressing the issues around equal pay to ensure the right questions are being asked." David Taylor, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Procter & Gamble"We aspire to create a better world for everyone—a world free of gender bias with equal representation and an equal voice for women and men. This begins inside our own company, where we're striving for equal representation for women and men at all levels and building an inclusive culture where everyone can contribute to their full potential. We seek insights that can shed light and inspire action to achieve gender equality—inside our workplace and more broadly in the world." KEY FINDINGS For every 100 women promoted to manager, 130 men are promotedPromotion rates for women lag behind those of men, and the disparity is the largest at the first step up to manager. As a result, far fewer women end up on the path to leadership. Very few women are in line to become CEOBy the time women reach the SVP level, they hold just 20% of line roles, and line roles lead more directly to the C-suite: In 2015, 90% of new CEOs in the S&P 500 were promoted or hired from line roles. Women experience an uneven playing fieldWomen get less access to the people and opportunities that advance careers and are disadvantaged in many of their daily interactions. These inequities appear to take a toll on women: They are less likely to think they have equal opportunities for growth and development—and more likely to think their gender will play a role in missing out on a raise, promotion, or chance to get ahead. Women of color have higher leadership aspirations, but face more barriers Compared to white women, women of color have higher aspirations to become a top executive but get less access to opportunities for growth and advancement. They also see a workplace that is less fair and inclusive. In all cases, Black women appear to be the most disadvantaged. Women are negotiating as often as men—but face pushback when they do Women who negotiate for a promotion or compensation increase are 30% more likely than men who negotiate to receive feedback that they are "bossy," "too aggressive," or "intimidating." Women get less access to senior leadersWomen and men both view sponsorship by senior leaders as essential for success. Yet women report fewer substantive interactions with senior leaders than their male counterparts do—and this gap widens as women and men advance. Women ask for feedback as often as men—but are less likely to receive itDespite asking for informal feedback as often as men do, women report they receive it less frequently. Moreover, there appears to be a disconnect in the way managers convey difficult feedback. Most managers say they rarely hesitate to give difficult feedback to both women and men, but women report they receive it less frequently.   Women are less interested in becoming top executives—and see the pros and cons of senior leadership differentlyOnly 40% of women are interested in becoming top executives, compared to 56% of men. Women and men worry equally about work-life balance and company politics. However, women with and without children are more likely to say they don't want the pressure, and women who want a top job anticipate a steeper path than men who do. Companies are highly committed to gender diversity, but struggling to put it into practiceLess than half of employees think their company is doing what it takes to improve gender diversity. In addition, less than a third of employees say senior leaders regularly communicate the importance of gender diversity and are held accountable for making progress. There are steps companies can take to promote gender equalityAlthough there's no "one size fits all" solution, the report identifies steps companies can take to advance gender equality: make a compelling case for gender diversity; ensure hiring, promotions, and reviews are fair; invest in more employee training; and focus on accountability and results.

Yet the executives' participation in this year's biggest initial public offering also serves as a reminder that investing in Chinese banks isn't what it used to be. When China's fifth-largest bank priced its $7.4 billion share sale last week, UBS and JPMorgan snared 5 percent paper gains on investments made nine months earlier. The shares will start trading in Hong Kong on Wednesday after being priced near the bottom of a marketed range. Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. more than doubled their money with China Construction Bank Corp. and Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. stakes respectively in 2005 and 2006 before those firms' shares started trading. History is failing to repeat itself as investors fret at the risks weighing down Chinese lenders. VIDEOS TOP JOBS JPMorgan's first purchase of a stake in one of the biggest Chinese lenders came a decade after a wave of bank IPOs in China generated multibillion-dollar windfalls for foreign banks. Goldman and Bank of America bought in before the global financial crisis when the Chinese economy was booming and sold after post-crisis banking rules made it more expensive to hold minority stakes. In a video played at roadshow briefings in Hong Kong and London, Dimon, 60, and Ermotti, 56, highlighted "strategic" tie-ups with Postal Savings Bank. JPMorgan will provide advice for the Chinese lender's retail finance business and help it to bolster trade finance capabilities, while UBS will aid efforts to provide wealth management services, according to the share sale prospectus. Spokesmen for JPMorgan, which is among joint sponsors of the IPO, and UBS, the sole financial adviser to the offering, declined last week to comment further. Ten strategic investors put 45.1 billion yuan ($6.8 billion) into the bank in December. UBS accounted for the largest share at 13.3 billion yuan, while JPMorgan took a 2.5 billion yuan stake. UBS could syndicate a significant portion of its stock to other investors, people familiar with the matter said ahead of the purchase. Global investors have become increasingly concerned that a rising tide of bad loans will threaten banks and the economy. While the lender's stock was priced near the low end, its valuation as measured by its price-to-book ratio is higher than those of other big state lenders. "I won't be surprised if Postal Savings Bank's shares fall below the IPO price on their debut," said Li Bin, a Shanghai-based analyst at Capital Securities Corp. "Their strategic investors must look at the deal from a very, very long-term perspective, betting they will be compensated by something else -- such as extra local government support for their own China businesses." UBS made a pre-IPO gain of about 160 percent in nine months on a $492 million investment in Bank of China Ltd. in 2005. The Swiss lender reaped about 35 percent on paper when a "bad bank" — China Cinda Asset Management Co., a manager of nonperforming loans — priced its initial share offer in 2013. Bank of America reaped 110 percent in two months from buying a $2.5 billion holding in China Construction Bank. Goldman Sachs more than doubled the value of its $2.6 billion stake in Industrial & Commercial Bank of China in six months. The gain was one of the firm's biggest investment wins since being founded in 1869, people with knowledge of Goldman's investments said at the time. Those investments were made "during the golden age of the Chinese economy," said Richard Cao, a Shenzhen-based analyst at Guotai Junan Securities Co. "Now, it's a different time, so that kind of return is not realistic." » Next page...

Here's how much the top Wall Street banks have earned in fees this year Portia Crowe Sep. 26, 2016, 9:16 AM 17,733 facebook linkedin twitter email print JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. JPMorgan has pulled in more fees than any other investment bank this year.Reuters JPMorgan is leading the pack when it comes to Wall Street dealmaking revenues, according to Dealogic's preliminary league tables for the first nine months of the year.  Altogether, global investment banking revenue was down 14% from the same period last year. That is improvement on the first half, where revenues came in 16% lower than the previous years. League tables are a contentious subject on Wall Street. Banks use them when pitching for new business, and a good ranking means serious bragging rights. But the league table-data can also be sliced up to make a bank's performance look better (by narrowing the field very narrowly, for example).   Though they're based on estimates, these tables are the broadest possible and a closely-watched indicator of who is up and who is down.  Here's how the banks stacked up this time around. View As: One Page Slides JPMorgan ranked first for overall investment banking revenues Dealogic JPMorgan has a 8.1% market share and $4.1 billion in total revenues for the year to September 26. It was followed by rival Goldman Sachs, with $3.4 billion and a 6.8% share. Bank of America was in third place, with $3.2 billion. Global investment banking revenue was $50.7 billion for the first nine months of 2015, which was down 14% compared to the same period last year. JPMorgan also ranked first for revenue in debt capital markets Dealogic JPMorgan has made $1.1 billion in revenue in debt capital markets, giving it an 6.9% share. Bank of America followed, with $1.1 billion in fees, and Citi raked in $923 million to place third. Global DCM volumes hit the $5 trillion earlier this month, putting 2016 on track to beat the 2006 full year record high of $6.62 trillion. And in equity capital markets Dealogic JPMorgan had a 8% share in equity capital markets, followed by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Global equity capital markets volumes, at $512.7 billion, was the lowest since 2012.  Goldman Sachs was the winner for M&A revenues Dealogic Goldman Sachs is well ahead of its rivals in M&A with $1.8 billion in revenues, versus JPMorgan's $1.5 billion and Morgan Stanley's $1.3 billion. Global M&A stands $2.5 trillion, down 24% from the same period a year ago.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch scored first place in syndicated loans. Dealogic Bank of America Merrill Lynch pulled in $798 million for arranging syndicated loan deals, versus JPMorgan's $745 million and Credit Suisse's $548 million.

  You are here: Home > Business > Banking and Finance China's rich enrich European banks 0 Comment(s)Print E-mail China Daily, September 26, 2016 Adjust font size: The appetite of China's wealthy to diversify from a weakening yuan is helping European finance companies boost capital to prepare for the next financial crisis. Global fund managers are urging caution. Since Aug 1, seven issuers opened order books for their Basel III bond sales in Asian hours, raising $11.9 billion selling instruments that count as capital under Basel III rules. HSBC Holdings Plc separately issued $2 billion of total loss-absorbing capacity notes in Taiwan province. In the first seven months, only three such deals opened in Asia. Asia's high net-worth individuals, whose wealth has surpassed counterparts in North America, have been major investors in regional bank bonds, slashing yields. They are turning to Europe even as a rout in shares of lenders including Deutsche Bank AG worsens. Hybrid issues with low, fixed coupons face downside risk from rising US Treasury yields, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. "Asian investors tend to be more yield-hungry and willing to take higher risks," said Ben Sy, the head of fixed income, currencies and commodities at the private banking arm of JPMorgan in Hong Kong. While they tend to focus on European banks with strong retail franchises, they "are getting complacent" when it comes to insurer bonds, he said. German insurer Allianz SE sold $1.5 billion of Tier 2 perpetual notes in August to yield 3.875 percent with the coupon fixed for life. Commerzbank AG says the higher returns promised by European banks come with greater risk amid low lending margins. Additional Tier 1 notes sold by European issuers in 2016 pay an average coupon of 6.6 percent, compared with 3.9 percent for Asia, Bloomberg-compiled data show. London-based Standard Chartered Plc sold $2 billion AT1 notes to yield 7.5 percent last month, with 31 percent going to Asian investors. Zurich-based UBS Group AG sold similar debt at 7.125 percent. By contrast, Singapore's DBS Group Holdings Ltd sold notes at 3.6 percent. "Asian bank debts are safer because governments may bail them out before AT1 investors suffer losses, while European governments are much less likely to do so," said He Xuanlai, credit analyst at Commerzbank in Singapore. "I don't think all investors buying into Europe hybrid bank bonds do extensive research." Noah Holdings Ltd said wealthy Chinese investors' demand for overseas assets may grow as much as 20 percent next year as they diversify from a yuan that dropped 4.6 percent in the past year. Australian issuers such as Westpac Banking Corp are also making Asian investors their first ports of call. "This trend has just started and is targeting a broader range of investors, including private banks and wealth management funds, that are looking for yields," said Clifford Lee, head of fixed income at DBS in Singapore. Deutsche Bank's 7.5 percent AT1 notes dived to a record low 72 cents on Feb 9, after it posted its first full-year loss since 2008. Its shares have tumbled 47 percent this year. "We really don't like European banks," said Donald Amstad, a director at Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Ltd. "The European Central Bank's quantitative easing has caused bond yields to collapse. Banking in Europe, already an unprofitable business, is now under further pressure." Follow China.org.cn on Twitter and Facebook to join the conversation.

JPM Shuffles Auto Finance, Consumer, Wealth Management Heads By Tanaya Macheel September 27, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Related JPMorgan Shuffles Three Top Execs in Cards, Mortgages Most Powerful Women: Thasunda Duckett, JPMorgan Chase How JPMorgan Chase Women Help Create Their Own Opportunities What Bankers Want (and Don't Want) from President Trump 'That's Just Really, Really Bad': Bank CEOs React to Wells Scandal Why Media Representation Matters for Women in Banking JPMorgan Chase's Thasunda Duckett has been named chief executive officer of consumer banking as part of one of the bank's periodic management reshufflings. Duckett, who was previously CEO of the bank's auto finance arm, is succeeding Barry Sommers, who was named a co-CEO of JPMorgan Wealth Management and Investment Solutions, a newly created unit serving the firm’s clients across the wealth spectrum, according to an internal memo shared with American Banker on Tuesday. Duckett had led auto finance since 2013, managing a portfolio of more than $60 billion in assets and relationships with 75% of U.S. franchised automotive dealers. Before that, she led national sales for mortgage banking. She was named one of American Banker's 25 Women to Watch in 2015 and 2016. In her new role she will oversee a banking network with more than $807 billion in deposits and investments, 5,300 branches and more than 47,000 employees, including 3,000 financial advisers. The bank will name her successor "shortly," Gordon Smith, CEO of consumer and community banking, said in the memo, and in the interim the auto finance leadership team will report to him. Sommers joined the consumer and community banking side of JPMorgan from asset management six years ago. In his new role he will oversee the client business — including JPMorgan Private Bank, JPMorgan Securities and Chase Wealth Management — with Brian Carlin. As the co-CEO in charge of investment and banking solutions, Carlin will be responsible for wealth management platforms and oversee the digital wealth management and institutional wealth management businesses. Carlin worked in asset management for 15 years, serving as chief financial officer for the last three. Before that he ran products and investments in JPMorgan's private bank. The reshuffling is the latest example of the company's strategic approach to ensuring its executives are well versed in all the company's businesses and fully understand the breadth of the organization. Earlier this year, Eileen Serra, then chief executive of the Chase Card Services unit, stepped down to advise the company on growth initiatives. Kevin Watters, who was previously CEO of mortgage banking, took her place.

The city’s employment growth is outpacing overall U.S. growth But Detroit has a relatively weak labor force participation rate. Only 62 percent of Detroiters between the ages of 16 and 64 are employed As part of its $100 million commitment to Detroit's economic recovery, the banking company JPMorgan Chase on Tuesday detailed how it had spent $1.3 million to boost skills training for in-demand jobs as it provided support for partnerships among job seekers, local employers and training providers. The new grants will support the Detroit Employment Solutions Corporation, United Way for Southeastern Michigan and Corporation for a Skilled Workforce. “By aligning our investments with the city’s workforce priorities, we are giving more residents the chance to climb the economic ladder and gain critical job skills and we are helping workforce leaders build effective job training and employer engagement programs,” Chauncy Lennon, head of workforce initiatives at JPMorgan Chase said in a statement. Related: Chase gives $4M jobs grant for Detroit About 6,200 more Detroiters are working today than in January and the city’s employment growth is outpacing overall U.S. growth, according to the city. Still, a recent Chase-backed report found that Detroit has a relatively weak labor force with only 62 percent of Detroiters between the ages of 16 and 64 employed. Additionally, many residents do not have the necessary skill and education levels to qualify for good-paying local jobs while workforce training programs were not well enough aligned with the needs of residents and employers.

The academy will help up to 20 local senior workforce leaders better engage employers, understand industry workforce needs, develop successful career pathway strategies and strengthen connections between training providers, job seekers and employers through a year-long program. More information about the program can be found here.  $680,000 for Detroit Employment Solutions Corporation to provide 100 pre-apprenticeships that are focused on career-specific skills development for jobs in the information technology, manufacturing, healthcare, advanced manufacturing and transportation/logistics industries. $150,000 for United Way for Southeastern Michigan to enable the Detroit Regional Workforce Fund, through its Access for All program, will create a pipeline of 100 new workers that have the necessary training and skills for careers in the construction and manufacturing industries. Also, the investment will support the growth of a prisoner re-entry program that connects ex-offenders to employment opportunities in skilled trades and other critical services.

(AMZN) Is Going to $1,000 Amazon stock is powered by the triumvirate of business: a legacy baseline, growthy projects and an all-time great leader By Tom Taulli, InvestorPlace Writer & IPO Playbook Editor  |  Sep 27, 2016, 2:35 pm EST     Popular Posts: The 7 Best Tech Stocks in the World Why Mobileye NV (MBLY) Stock Is a Buyout Lock 3 Absolutely Frightening Trends for Twitter Inc (TWTR) Stock Recent Posts: Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock: Is the Trump Boost Over? Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock Is Screeching to a Halt The 7 Best Tech Stocks in the World View All Posts Since the dawn of the Internet Age in the mid-1990s, hundreds of dot-coms have come and gone. But Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has built a lasting empire — and made many people very rich in the process. Amazon stock has logged an astounding 47,000%-plus gain during its existence, and it’s now worth $387 billion by market capitalization. Source: Mike Seyfang via Flickr And yet, AMZN still feels like a scrappy startup. During the past 12 months, it has been one of the biggest gainers among large-cap stocks (up roughly 55%). Even Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) has only gained 40% in the past year. And it has done so not just on the back of its giant retail operations, but thanks to explosive growth in cloud services and expansion in streaming video. Can Amazon stock keep up the momentum? JPMorgan certainly thinks so — its analysts boosted their price target on AMZN from $925 to a nice, clean $1,000. That would be a return of more than 20% from today’s prices. I’m completely on board with JPMorgan’s bullishness on Amazon stock. Here are three reasons why: #1: Amazon, The E-Commerce Juggernaut Amazon has spent billions of dollars building its e-commerce platform — not just website development, but building warehouses, installing logistics systems and even deploying robots. AMZN also was smart in developing the Prime program — not just for the one-hour delivery, but because add-on services such as music and video help engage users. 10 Stocks That Should Be in Your Portfolio Right Now All in all, Amazon has built an enormous moat that most rivals can’t touch. According to eMarketer, AMZN controls nearly three-quarters of the U.S. e-commerce market. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT)? Try 3%. E-commerce still is a growth market, too. Based on research from Forrester, e-commerce sales are forecast to improve from $344 billion in 2015 to $480 billion by 2019. Consumers are shifting their buying habits, moving away from traditional brick-and-mortar operators like Macy’s, Inc. (NYSE:M) to digital platforms. Amazon stock should reap the benefits this holiday season, just like the rest. In anticipation of the spurt in revenues, AMZN has opened 18 new fulfillment centers, up from just six last year. It’s just prudent planning. After all, Signal and Shift Communications say about 43% of internet users already are thinking about using Amazon as their primary holiday shopping source. Amazon Web Services (AWS) One longstanding knock against Amazon stock was the company’s long history of net losses. But these are becoming a thing of the past. For the past five quarters, AMZN has pumped out profits — including three quarterly earnings that reached record levels. Yes, the aforementioned e-commerce business remains a low-margin category. But Amazon is countering that with its high-margin Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, which provides cloud services to businesses. In the latest quarter, AWS revenues spiked from $1.82 billion to $2.89 billion. That’s nice. Operating income came to a $718 million. That’s just flat-out juicy. The cloud market represents a megatrend in the tech industry. The technology tends to be cheaper than legacy systems, but allows for better analytics and training with less overall maintenance. Amazon isn’t alone. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are ramping their cloud efforts, too. The prospects look bright for this part of the market, with Morgan Stanley predicting that global spending will jump from $70 billion last year to $141 billion by 2019. Jeff Bezos Has Been Great for Amazon Stock Jeff Bezos is one the world’s best CEOs. During the past two decades, he has fended off scores of tough competitors (and even buried a few), and survived grueling recessions and tech busts. A key to his success has certainly been the undeniable focus on his customers. He once summed up his thinking with this little phrase: “Put the customer first. Invent. And be patient.” Bezos hasn’t won on every front, of course. Anyone remember the ill-fated Fire Phone? But innovators rarely have unscathed records, and Bezos has plenty of success — like the Kindle and Echo — to make up for the failures. How Tesla Motors (TSLA) Turned a Hack Into a Competitive Advantage Bezos also has a good sense of finding breakout opportunities, such as AWS, which he built from scratch and turned into a cash cow in roughly a decade. That’s ultimately what will move the needle for Amazon stock.

The grants announced Tuesday are part its earlier $100 million commitment to Detroit's economic recovery. The company says the training will be for in-demand jobs and to help strengthen partnerships between job seekers, local employers and training providers. The funding supports efforts by the Detroit Employment Solutions Corp., the United Way for Southeastern Michigan and the Corporation for a Skilled Workforce. Plans call for a new leadership development academy for local workforce professionals, improving connections between Detroiters and existing job openings in growing local industries and addressing skills desired by local employers that job seekers might need. ___ Online: http://www.jpmorganchase.com Trending http://www.clickondetroit.com

JPM Hires Moven Co-Founder Alex Sion as Banking, Fintech Converge By Penny Crosman September 27, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Worlds collide: "The differences are actually getting smaller" between fintech and banking, says Alex Sion, who is leaving his startup to work at the country's largest financial institution RELATED Battle for Talent Heats Up as Digital Banking Becomes Paramount JPM Names Digital Boss; Memo Implies Predecessor Forced Out of Role Citi Recruits JPM's Gavin Michael to Lead Consumer Technology Digital Asset Recruits Execs from RBS, JPMorgan, B of A How Mobile Banking Is Raising Its Game Customer Experience Is the Tie that Binds Banks and Fintech 'More Sophisticated': Evolution of the Bank-Fintech Dialogue JPMorgan Chase has hired Alex Sion, co-founder of the mobile-only neobank Moven, to lead its mobile apps. The move is an example of how banks are looking to fintech entrepreneurs to bring innovation in, and it illustrates the emphasis and importance banks are putting on their mobile channels. It's also the latest round of musical chairs for big banks' digital channel executives. Sion will start his new job, executive director of mobile banking at Chase, on Oct. 3. "My new role is to keep promoting mobile leadership and innovation across all of Chase's mobile assets," Sion said in an email interview. "Chase is absolutely committed to leading the pack in digital." Sion is not new to the challenges of working in a big bank. He was at one time senior vice president of wealth management at Citigroup. What's it like to go from the banking world to the fintech world and back? "The differences are actually getting smaller since we're all trying to accomplish most of the same things for the customer: make banking more simple and personal," Sion said. "That wasn't the focus when Moven first started. So, for banks like Chase, who are committed to customer-centricity and digital leadership, the differences become mainly around managing scale." Sion will work with the bank's digital team at 5 Manhattan West, a space that was recently renovated to foster agile development, with designated scrum rooms, play areas and white boards galore. He will report to Jason Alexander, executive director of digital platforms, who reports to Bill Wallace, a Chase veteran who took Gavin Michael's position as head of digital for consumer banking in August, when Michael left to head consumer technology for Citi. Michael replaced Mark Torkos, who retired in July. Chase's mobile app has 25 million active users. "Mobile is becoming more and more central to the banking experience, so Alex will develop and drive the evolution of that mobile strategy and execution across Chase," said spokeswoman Rebecca Acevedo. "We're seeing the importance of digital in all our businesses as customers continue to turn to Digital to complete many of their banking tasks. We want our digital experiences to be simple, personal, human and cohesive." Moven's other co-founder, Brett King, not only wishes Sion well but spent several months hashing over his different job offers with him. "We talked a lot about the opportunities that were presenting themselves to Alex," King said. "He had a number of offers, as you'd imagine. We talked through what was best for his career and also what was best for Moven. We both agreed that from a visibility perspective, this move to Chase would be seen as a win for Moven; it showed the credibility of his pedigree with Moven." King noted that Sion has been at Moven for six years. "It's not like he didn't give it a fair shot," King said. "And also, the business is fairly mature now. We've been going from that early stage to a growth company and it requires some different skills." Such skills include being able to deliver revenue and sales consistently. "It's not that Alex can't do that stuff, but I think he wanted a challenge again," King said. "Taking on 25 million mobile users at Chase, that's about as big as a challenge gets." At Moven, this transition has been in the works for months. Mircea Mihaescu, chief operating officer, and a couple of other team members have taken over Sion's responsibilities. "The transition has been lengthy and has been handled by Alex," King said. Moven, which recently signed on TD Bank and Westpac New Zealand as clients, has a couple of big banks in the pipeline to join as customers late this year or early next year. The company has also recently hired people in Europe and Asia to help oversee regional operations. This isn't the first time a bank has poached a Moven executive. Mohamed Khalil, who used to be Moven's head of product, data and partnerships, became chief innovation officer at Commonwealth Bank of Australia just over a year ago. "The overall message is we're proud of Alex and we think it's a great opportunity for him," King said. "He's done Moven proud."

This decision was linked to a criminal case where the accused hacked into the systems of JPMorgan Chase & Co and some other organisations, Reuters reported. So, if you possess some bitcoins or are planning to venture into this space merely out of curiosity, you need to remember that as of now, crypto-currencies like bitcoins are not regulated in India. Here is what you should know about bitcoins before you plan to hold some in your wallet. We also look at the regulations, cyber threats and taxation of crypto-currencies. Regulatory concerns In 2013, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had cautioned the users, holders and traders of virtual currencies, including bitcoins, about the potential financial, operational, legal, customer protection and security-related risks that they could expose themselves to (http://bit.ly/2cpQmkz). “The creation, trading or usage of virtual currencies including Bitcoins, as a medium for payment are not authorised by any central bank or monetary authority,” RBI had stated. In an email on 22 September,the RBI told Mint that the central bank’s stance on these currencies has not changed. Two years after the 2013 cautionary note, in December 2015, the RBI spoke about looking into blockchain—the underlying technology of bitcoin. And in June this year, it spoke about setting up a committee to study the benefits of blockchain technology for banks. “It’s not easy to regulate a technology that is as disruptive as bitcoin, since it’s highly decentralised. But we know for a fact that the RBI is not ignoring bitcoin and blockchain technologies, and intendS to regulate it. Last heard, the RBI is aiming to regulate crypto-currencies by 2017,” said Mohit Kalra, chief executive officer and founder, Coinsecure, a Delhi-based bitcoin exchange and trading platform. Click here for enlarge Security concerns Besides regulatory concerns, bitcoins have been vulnerable to cyber frauds globally. “Bitcoins have been reported to be exposed to several frauds in the past. Users have lost money to fraudulent sellers,” said Kalra. In August, Reuters reported that hackers penetrated a secure authentication system at a bitcoin exchange called Bitfinex, and stole about $70 million worth of the virtual currency. But that may be just the tip of the iceberg. According to a study that was shared with Reuters, and was done by Tyler Moore, assistant professor of cyber security at the University of Tulsa’s Tandy School of Computer Science, funded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security: between bitcoin’s creation in 2009 and March 2015, 33% of all bitcoin exchanges were hacked. Hence, if you are a user, you have to be careful. “Users have to take care of their digital wallets,” said Mupparaju Sivakameswara Rao, chief executive officer, BTCXIndia, a Hyderabad-based bitcoin exchange platform. “In India, I don’t see any benefit of using bitcoins unless you are speculating or you already have bitcoins and want to transact. Also, no one knows about the cyber security mechanisms of individual companies,” said Amit Jaju, executive director, fraud investigation and dispute services, EY India. How are bitcoins taxed Bitcoins in India are mostly used to trade, to make payments for overseas transactions and to convert into Indian currency. If you profit from trading in bitcoins, how will you be taxed? The crypto-currency industry lacks consensus on this issue. “The person who invests in bitcoins shall be subject to capital gains tax,” said Sandeep Goenka, co-founder, Zebpay, an app-enabled bitcoin exchange. “It does not come under capital gains tax in India because Sebi (Securities and Exchange Board of India) and the government don’t consider bitcoin as a security. Users may declare it as income on digital assets and pay tax as on other normal asset incomes,” said Rao. According to Gautam Nayak, a Mumbai-based chartered accountant, “It is an intangible asset and taxation will depend on the frequency of transactions. If you are buying (for) trading, then it will be considered as business income and taxed accordingly. However, if you are buying it for investment, it will attract capital gains tax—at 30% for short term and 20% on long term.” Others suggest that it is better to wait for clear directions from the RBI before buying bitcoins. “One would have to wait and watch the direction the regulator wants to take in the future, before venturing into this space,” said Vivek Belgavi, partner, financial services—fintech and technology consulting leader, PwC India. Mint Money does not recommend buying bitcoins for investment purposes or otherwise. However, if you still want to venture in this space, tread with caution.

Online food delivery company FreshDirect said on Monday it had raised $189 million in a round led by JPMorgan Asset Management, as it seeks to expand its geographic footprint. The funding will help Long Island City, New York-based FreshDirect expand its capacity and reach, as it builds on the initial success it has enjoyed in its home area. JPMorgan Asset Management led the fundraising round through its internet and digital media-focused PG Digital Growth Fund. Other participants included existing investor W Capital and the AARP Innovation Fund. Larry Unrein and Ashmi Mehrotra, who serve as head and managing director at J.P. Morgan Asset Management's private equity group respectively, will join FreshDirect's board of directors. Launched in 2002, FreshDirect is an online food grocer that delivers fresh meat, produce and other specialty items, primarily in the New York and Philadelphia areas. Its recently introduced FoodKick program in Brooklyn promises to deliver food, alcohol and other products in less than an hour. With $600 million in annual sales, the company says it has been profitable since 2010. It is "too early" to comment on potential plans for either an initial public offering or a sale to a larger competitor, Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Jason Ackerman said in an interview. Armed with new financing, FreshDirect expects to move into new territory, Ackerman said, declining to give specifics for fear of tipping off tipping off rivals. "We've always felt like a majority of the competition is fought at the local level," he said. FreshDirect has faced increased competition in recent years from meal kit companies such as Plated and Blue Apron, which deliver prepared meal ingredients and instructions, as well as InstaCart, which allows shoppers to home-order directly from their local supermarket such as Whole Foods Market. Internet giant Amazon.com, which first experimented with its food delivery system, AmazonFresh, in 2007, has now expanded to cities that include New York, Baltimore and Los Angeles. Ackerman said, however, that the influx of rivals would help make shopping for groceries online more widespread. He told CNBC on Monday the company is on a five-year plan towards becoming a public company, a goal that the recent investment will help achieve. "We're two years into the plan," Ackerman said. — CNBC's Elizabeth Gurdus contributed to this report.

Auto Show Fox Business 3:04 A look at Nashville's music industry and health care BBC News 1:32 Airplane ticket prices to fall in 2017 Reuters 1:11 UP NEXT Somewhere in the middle of Ohio there’s a nondescript office park, the kind you could drive by for years and never really notice. One of the buildings in that park is basically windowless; you might mistake it for a warehouse or, if you were feeling exotic, a data center. The only thing that’s remarkable about the structure, signaling there’s something of great value inside, is an imposing floor-to-ceiling metal turnstile in a guarded vestibule. This building is a modern-day mint. It’s where JPMorgan Chase, the largest issuer of credit cards in the U.S., manufactures around 60 percent of the 95 million cards it issues each year. The company requires visitors to keep its exact location secret. For more than 15 years, the facility has hummed along, embossing numbers onto plastic cards and stuffing them into envelopes. During that time, only three things have really disrupted BAU, Chase-ese for “business as usual”: the Target data breach of 2014, which required the factory to quickly reissue millions of cards; the industrywide 2015 switch from magnetic-stripe cards to ones that include microchips; and in August the frenzied demand for the company’s newest offering—the Chase Sapphire Reserve. Ned Lindsey, Chase’s managing director of customer fulfillment, runs the Ohio plant and a sister facility in Texas. On Aug. 24, Lindsey noticed something strange—card requests were coming in at an extremely high rate, all for the Reserve. “We were seeing demand that was eight- to tenfold more than what we expected,” he says. Lindsey, it seems, doesn’t read credit card blogs. Since July, a fever had been building on social media among points-and-miles obsessives aware that Chase was preparing a premium card—one that would sit above its already-popular Sapphire Preferred, and offer rewards to match. Almost a month before Chase introduced Reserve, the community discovered the card’s perks through some leaked information: a sign-up bonus of 100,000 points, triple points on travel and dining, airport lounge memberships, and credits that offset a $450 annual fee, among other goodies. Of course, like its Sapphire Preferred brethren, the card would have a weighty metal core that creates what is known in the trade as “plunk factor.” © Finlay MacKay for Bloomberg Businessweek Plasticheads got the vapors. “When I first heard the details,” wrote Brian Kelly, aka The Points Guy, probably the most influential card blogger, “I had to sit down, because it sounded way too good to be true.” The Sapphire Reserve, wrote another, Ben Schlappig, is “beyond a no-brainer, possibly the most compelling card we’ve ever seen.” On Reddit, a user shared that Chase had accidentally published a Reserve application link, and thousands of applications poured in before the page was deactivated. By the official launch date of Aug. 23, anticipation had built to the point that the Chase site was bumrushed by a horde of deal-seekers. In Ohio, Lindsey brought in extra staff and added shifts. “We had to have a backup plan to the backup plan,” he says. The plant ran hot for about three weeks. During that time, Chase burned through its inventory of metal cards—a stock that was supposed to last 10 to 12 months. (The company declined to say how many Preferred or Reserve cards it’s issued.) To continue to sate the appetite for the Sapphire Reserve, Chase had to switch to standard plastic cards as placeholders. The bank says it’s now sent out as many plastic cards as metal—two years’ worth of cards, gone in less than a month. When the first cards were shipped, some customers posted “unboxing” videos on YouTube, reverently exhibiting terms-and-conditions pamphlets to the camera. The videos have garnered more than 60,000 views; the Reddit thread has 10,000 comments. The hype usually reserved for a new iPhone was now being applied to a high-interest line of credit. And until mid-September, Chase hadn’t spent a dime on advertising. Chase is not the first issuer to offer a big-annual-fee-but-mucho-points card. American Express and Citibank have been playing in that part of the market for years. But Chase has entered at the right time—when a growing community of enthusiasts will do the company’s marketing online for free—and with the right card, one that assiduously checks every box the modern credit card deal-hunter cares about. None of this happened by accident. The process to create new credit cards is little different from the research Procter & Gamble does to develop a new laundry detergent or Honda does to develop a new crossover SUV. A credit card is a means of payment and the extension of a loan, but it’s also a collection of perks and points that confer experiences and status upon its user, as well as an object people typically touch several times a day. In a country with more than half a billion credit cards already in circulation, it’s not a given that any new combination of attributes will work. Chase had already learned a thing or two about how to make a card more than a card. The Sapphire Preferred, introduced in 2009 with a $95 annual fee, was the reigning “It card” before Reserve came along. One especially devoted cardholder is Bryan Denman, a 35-year-old New York creative director, who has taken advantage of Preferred’s perks to treat his girlfriend to Chase-sponsored private dinners at the restaurants Craft, Rebelle, and Le Bernardin, as well as to get good seats at venues like Madison Square Garden. Denman recognizes that loyalty to a credit card is unusual. “Everyone’s brought up to distrust their credit card company,” he says. “You don’t want to be on the phone with them; why would you want to spend the night with them?” But his experiences with Chase have conferred upon Denman the zeal of a convert. “I am a complete fanboy,” he says. “I’m telling everyone to get this card.” He’s not alone. “When I go to dinner, there might be three cards that get thrown down. They’re all Chase Sapphire.” At Chase, finding the Bryan Denmans of the marketplace is a task led by Gordon Smith. When he’s not restoring classic sports cars—like a 1969 Jaguar E-Type from England, where he grew up—he’s in charge of the company’s card and consumer-banking divisions. Having previously headed up the U.S. card business for American Express, Smith joined Chase in 2007. When he got there, he saw that the bank’s card business was little more than a consumer-finance operation. In that context, he says, “a customer doesn’t think about themselves really as having the credit card. They think about themselves as having the loan.” This wasn’t where Smith wanted his credit card division to be. A card that people think of as only a loan is not a card customers have a relationship with, much less a card they want to use all the time. “They could keep the card itself in a shoebox, not necessarily in their wallet,” says Smith. At the same time, the marketplace was going through an upheaval. The financial crisis led banks to step back from offering plastic to anyone with a pulse, and many Americans drastically cut their credit card bills. The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act of 2009 placed numerous restrictions on how issuers could penalize or otherwise dun their members for exorbitant fees, erasing billions from the low end of the market. Cards for more affluent consumers were a safer bet. The right kind of card in this environment would have to be, as they say in the credit card industry, “top of wallet”—something you use frequently as your preferred method of payment. The reason has to do with the fact that card issuers can make money in two ways: interest and fees or interchange. The recession and the CARD Act made the interest-and-fees strategy a much harder proposition. “It was clear that revolving-credit cards were not going to be the moneymaker they once were,” says David Robertson, the publisher of the Nilson Report, an industry newsletter. Interchange became the way to go. Someone who uses his card all day, every day, for everything from a cup of Starbucks to a new Rolex Submariner, is allowing his issuer to collect a small fee on every transaction. That fee—the interchange—is higher for premium cards such as Chase’s Sapphires. The fee is higher still when the card is used at a luxury retailer, which is more likely with a high-end card. And since the fee is something charged to the merchant, not the shopper, it saves banks from incurring more consumer wrath. For all these reasons, Chase decided to pursue a premium strategy. But a premium credit card would have to be something different in 2009 than when they first came about in the 1980s and ’90s. That market was effectively established and defined by American Express, which had launched cards like the Platinum in 1984 and the black Centurion card in 1999. Its top-shelf cards came with hefty annual fees ($450 and $2,500, respectively) but also a complement of perks and services that, it was suggested, could almost change the laws of nature to meet your needs. Dedicated concierges could secure last-minute reservations at popular restaurants; Centurion cardholders could be greeted at international airports and whisked through customs and immigration. In the throes of the Great Recession, Chase judged that luxury would have to be cloaked in understated virtue, not sybaritic excess. The modern affluent customer was more Joni Mitchell than Joan Collins: more casual, more discreet—millionaires with minivans. To attract that kind of customer, a new credit card would have to offer a sense of being a sound financial choice. One way for Chase to do that would be to lower the annual fee from hundreds of dollars to $95. “When you look at where you’re going to price something, on a per-unit basis it can be very profitable obviously with a high price, but you’re going to find a much smaller group of people who will find the product attractive,” says Chase’s Smith. “How do we price it in such a way that it would be economically viable for us, but the customer will look at it and say, ‘You know what? I have to pay a fee, but that’s good value.’ "That value can also be emphasized by a robust rewards program. The dirty little open secret of those older elite cards was that, for all their swagger and status, they were actually pretty lousy at rewarding their users. “With the American Express Platinum, you get one point per dollar on all purchases other than travel purchases from American Express’s travel agent,” says Jason Steele, a writer for CompareCards.com. “Yet with less expensive annual fees, there are cards that could get two times or three times for every dollar you spend.” Keeping track of miles and points used to be the domain of road-warrior obsessives, who could debate the relative merits of rewards programs with Talmudic specificity, but collecting and using rewards has gotten decidedly more mainstream. Credit card review sites—many of which earn commissions on driving leads to issuers’ websites—act like an accelerant when a new card catches fire. They rank high in Google searches and dominate discussion boards. ThePointsGuy, the site Kelly runs, now has close to 3 million unique visitors every month, which makes it about as heavily trafficked as Bleacher Report, the popular sports site. Many points-granting cards rely on a complex system of rotating bonus categories. The Citi Dividend card, for example, gives 5 percent cash back on Hilton hotel rooms and car rentals in the current quarter; in October, the offer shifts to Best Buy and department store purchases. With Sapphire, Chase opted for simplicity. “What these customers tell us,” says Pam Codispoti, the president of Chase’s branded cards division, “is that rewards matter, but while we want them to be very valuable, we actually don’t want to do a whole lot of work to understand the rules and regulations around them.” Chase introduced the Sapphire Preferred card in 2009 with double points in two large categories: dining and travel. The card also allowed users to transfer their points to a broad range of frequent-flier programs (at the cost of undercutting its existing range of co-branded cards with United Airlines). The moderate fee, generous points, and partner network got the Sapphire Preferred noticed, and as consumer spending began to rebound after the recession, it came to be regularly cited on card-enthusiast sites as one of the all-around best. Chase’s emphasis on value dovetails with the psychology of what the company refers to as the “new affluent”: a segment of the population that is well-to-do but still in its prime earning years. For them, it’s more important to be savvy than fancy. More Kirkland vodka from Costco, less Stolichnaya Elit. “You feel smart with this card,” says Kelly, describing the image of the first Sapphire card. “You’re ‘in the know.’ You’re not flashy.” The design of Chase’s Sapphire Preferred card, which has now been extended to the Reserve, has been a surprisingly powerful asset. Sapphire cards are nearly featureless on the front, with little more than a chip, the cardholder’s name, and some discreet branding. The numbers are flush on the back, but what always gets remarked upon is the card’s weight. With a metal core sandwiched between two pieces of plastic, the Sapphire Preferred has noticeably more heft than a regular, all-plastic card. Chase won’t say what materials are used, but Lindsey, the plant director, says the form factor costs “5 to 10 times as much as a standard card”; chip-enabled cards cost around $2 to make. “I have the Chase Sapphire Preferred, and virtually nothing gives me more pleasure when I pay and the cashier notices how gorgeous that card is,” says Sean McQuay, the credit card expert at NerdWallet, a personal-finance site. (He has since gotten a Reserve; “the sign-up bonus was too good to ignore,” he says.) “Chase has basically realized that the weight raises customers’ dopamine levels. Being able to get into my brain every single time I swipe my card—there’s literally nothing better a marketer could want.” Chase’s neurotransmitter strategy has had a positive effect on its bottom line: In 2007, the bank’s card-services division reported net income of $2.9 billion; in 2015, that figure was $3.9 billion. As the Sapphire Preferred became a success, Smith assembled new teams at Chase to determine what kind of card would appeal to an even wealthier slice of consumers. The market seemed ready: Both Citi and Amex had cut some perks from their high-end cards, such as airport-lounge access and free rounds of golf, disappointing some cardholders. Perhaps they’d be interested in a new card? From the beginning, though, it was clear that the new, upmarket card would share the Sapphire name, which was a new step for the company. “What Chase had done largely before is come out with completely new names” for new cards, says Smith. “So all that brand equity that you built up was effectively gone.” With Sapphire, Smith is trying to develop a platform. Always the car enthusiast, he thinks of Sapphire Preferred as Chase’s BMW 3 Series, and the Sapphire Reserve as the larger, more luxurious 5 Series. “We wanted Sapphire to stand for the things that it always stood for but give us the space to keep growing and evolving it,” he says, “so that the brand name of Sapphire would still resonate with customers and stay relevant.” Smith knows enough about cars to know that above the BMW 3 Series and 5 Series is the flagship 7 Series. While Chase hasn’t said whether it intends to move even further upmarket, it would not be at all surprising if the bank followed Sapphire Preferred and Reserve with, say, Sapphire Premier. That would be a pure play to the affluent, no “mass” required. Already, competitors such as Barclays have launched new cards like the Gold Luxury Card, which comes with a $1,000 annual fee but is actually less rewarding than the Sapphire Reserve. At the top of the heap is American Express’s Centurion, which commands exorbitant fees ($7,500 as an initiation fee, followed by a $2,500 annual fee) for those lucky enough to be invited to join. If Reserve sustains its momentum, a move into more rarefied incomes may be next. “I think a number of issuers think that Amex is ready to be run down,” says the Nilson Report’s Robertson. Fortunately for Chase, it’s getting new cardholders while they’re young—to a surprising degree. When it was originally conceived, Reserve was expected to attract a slightly older customer, but Chase says the majority of applicants have been millennials. Kelly thinks Sapphire has transcended the surly bonds of personal finance. “They’ve built a lifestyle brand out of it,” he says. Perhaps that’s Chase’s greatest accomplishment: It has managed to make Sapphire a modern, desirable credit card for people who would otherwise not care about their credit card. “They’ve managed to take something from being a stupid card you carry in your wallet,” says Denman, “to a part of your identity, like the clothes you wear.” —With Ben Steverman Go to MSN Home More in Money 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney 12 leaders who took $1 salaries Money What Trump's win could mean for older Americans CBS News 30 things you should never buy without a coupon GOBankingRates 6 brand mascots that actually existed in real life Business Insider 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money AdChoices AdChoices Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

The rules proposed Friday will be another boon for merchant houses including Trafigura Group Pte Ltd and Vitol SA, which already are luring employees away with the promise of better pay and less red tape, said Ross Gregory, managing consultant at Commodity Search Partners, a London-based employment company. "It's going to be another sign for these guys who think, 'It's just more rope around our necks,' which is already pushing more of them to go work at trading houses," Mr Gregory said in a telephone interview from New York, where he's based. The Fed proposal would require banks to put up more capital to support investments in physical commodities, limit the amount of trading and restrict ownership of power plants and copper. The central bank estimated the plan would require about US$4 billion in additional capital from firms including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley. The goal is to reduce the financial risks posed by such trading, Fed officials said. Lenders including JPMorgan Chase & Co and Deutsche Bank AG have been paring back their commodity units in recent years, as regulators tightened restrictions following the financial crisis. The merchant trading houses have stepped into their place. US-based Castleton Commodities International LLC bought Morgan Stanley's physical oil trading arm last year, while JPMorgan sold its physical trading business to Swiss-based Mercuria Energy Group Ltd in 2014. Meanwhile, former commodities executives have left Wall Street to establish their own firms. David Silbert, who built the commodities business at Deutsche Bank, founded TrailStone Group in 2013 with financing from private equity. Ben Freeman, a former Goldman Sachs oil derivatives trader, created HudsonField LLC with the support of AllianceBernstein Holding LP, with the aim of catering to middle-market oil firms no longer served by the banks. "This is going to redound to the benefit of the merchant traders," said Craig Pirrong, a professor at the University of Houston's Bauer College of Business. "It's very clear that the Fed does not want banks touching physical commodities, no way, no how." The Fed proposal should come as little surprise to most players after years of debate over the banks' influence on commodity markets, Mr Pirrong said in a telephone interview. If there's a downside for trading houses, it's that it may get harder for them to tap banks to finance long-term trades and asset purchases, he said. Mr Gregory, the employment specialist, estimated about 10 to 20 per cent of the banks' teams are leaving each year to join trading houses. Salaries offered by trading houses and banks are roughly comparable, at about US$250,000 for a "strong" senior trader, Mr Gregory said. But trading houses give a bigger cut of profits on top of salary. Merchant houses typically pay traders about 12 per cent of the annual profits they generate, while banks offer closer to 5 per cent, he said. "Some people are locked into the banks with golden handcuffs because their deferred bonuses are large, but they would take an option to get out if they can find it," he said. In addition to individual workers, whole trading businesses may be on the move as well, according to Mr Gregory. "It wouldn't surprise me if some of these trading houses see an opportunity to say to the banks, 'Hey, do you guys want me to take this off your hands?'"

The New York-based bank has set up a company-wide task force to target opportunities in Saudi Arabia and holds weekly calls to coordinate the push, people familiar with the firm’s strategy said, asking not to be identified because the plan is private. Those leading the charge include Alberto Verme, banking chairman for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and regional Chief Executive Officer Atiq Ur Rehman, according to three of the people. The bank’s efforts may be paying off after it won a role as lead adviser on Saudi Arabia’s first international bond sale, which could raise at least $10 billion as soon as next month. Citigroup is keen to profit from a potential fee bonanza as the nation undergoes an unprecedented economic shakeup, including plans to create the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund and sell shares of crude giant Saudi Arabia Oil Co. in an initial public offering. “Citi’s exit from Saudi put some strain on their activities there, but they have worked hard to get back into the kingdom," said Emad Mostaque, a London-based strategist at emerging-markets consultancy Ecstrat Ltd. ‘Fantastic Wallet’ Verme is a 59-year-old Peruvian native who worked at companies in Madrid and London before joining Salomon Brothers in 1994, while Ur Rehman is a Pakistani with more than 30-years experience at Citi who has lead the bank’s efforts in the Middle East since 2010. He was previously co-head of capital markets origination for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Implementing Saudi Arabia’s plans to restructure the economy and privatize assets -- known as Vision 2030 -- “could translate into a fantastic wallet for the investment banks,” Omar Iqtidar, Citigroup’s investment banking head in the Middle East, said in a May interview in Dubai. License Restrictions The lender lost a key banking license when it sold its stake in Samba Financial Group in 2004. Without a license from the Capital Markets Authority, international banks face restrictions on pitching for deals on the ground and working on deals that are signed in Saudi Arabia or takeovers where the target company is based in the kingdom.  Despite those hurdles, Citigroup beat rivals in June to be hired as one of three global coordinators for the international bond sale along with JPMorgan Chase & Co. and HSBC Holdings Inc., people with knowledge of the matter said at the time. It was also among 15 banks that helped raise a $10 billion loan in April, a deal where Saudi Arabia held out the prospect of a role in the subsequent international bond sale to participants. "A key part of the new governance regime in Saudi Arabia is looking for results, rather than dwelling on the past," Mostaque said. “They need their financing to be successful and to attract as much money as possible into the kingdom.” Majority Stakes The U.S. bank was able to pitch for the sovereign bond as the government is excluded from CMA rules. Citigroup can also pitch for international bonds and advisory work for Saudi clients from Dubai or their other global offices. A Citigroup spokeswoman in London declined to comment, as did the Saudi Capital Markets Authority. The bank opened its Saudi operations in 1955 in the Red Sea port of Jeddah. In the 1970s, the government forced foreign banks to sell majority stakes in their local operations to Saudi nationals, but a 2003 capital-market law opened the door for foreign banks to apply for licenses. In 2004, Citigroup was focusing on countries where it could control a majority stake. That strategy led to the sale of its 20 percent stake in Samba, formerly known as Saudi American Bank, to the state’s Public Investment Fund for $760 million. Through a management contract, Citigroup ran about 62 Saudi American branches at the time. Samba is currently the third-largest bank by assets and market capitalization in Saudi Arabia, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. ‘Mistake’ The exit was called a “mistake” in 2007 by Mohammed al-Shroogi, the bank’s then-managing director for the Middle East. In the intervening years, Citigroup executives have continued to visit the kingdom and expressed interest in returning to Saudi Arabia. The bank applied unsuccessfully for a license to return to the country in 2006. It tried again in 2010 and failed, despite lobbying by longtime shareholder Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Al Saud. The billionaire said in an interview that year that he was helping the bank set up in Saudi Arabia. Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat, Ur Rehman and Verme were among executives to visit Alwaleed in 2013, according to a statement at the time. The grandson of King Abdul-Aziz Alsaud, founder and first ruler of Saudi Arabia, Alwaleed doesn’t currently hold an official government position within the Saudi royal family, but is considered one of the country’s most prominent business figures. He has been a strong supporter of Citigroup since he first invested in the bank in 1991, and publicly praised former CEO Vikram Pandit for his handling of the global financial crisis. Calls to Alwaleed’s offices in Riyadh weren’t immediately returned. Without the key CMA license, Citigroup has missed out on Saudi Arabia’s IPO market -- the region’s busiest with 83 offerings priced since 2006, compared with 73 in the rest of the Gulf Cooperation Council region, which includes the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Citigroup ranked 14th among local and international banks in investment banking fees earned in Saudi Arabia over the past five years, reaping $16 million to achieve a 2 percent market share, according to New York-based research firm Freeman & Co. That trailed its much stronger performance in the rest of the Gulf Cooperation Council nations, ranking third with a 4 percent market share and $119 million earned. By contrast, bankers who worked for Citigroup before 2004 are well-represented among advisers on the current revamp. Michael Klein’s M. Klein & Co. is providing strategic advice to the government and advising on the IPO of Aramco, people with knowledge of the matter said in April. Verus Partners Ltd., a London-based advisory boutique co-founded by former Citigroup bankers Mark Aplin and Andrew Elliott, helped Saudi Arabia secure its first loan in 15 years in April. Financing Deals Even without bankers on the ground, Citigroup has provided more finance to borrowers in the kingdom than rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Deutsche Bank AG, which both have local operations and large teams based in the country. Citigroup is the fourth-largest manager and bookrunner for loans to companies in the kingdom over the past 10 years, providing $6.5 billion of loans. JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank have lent $6.2 billion and $3.2 billion respectively, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Last year, the firm won approval to trade Saudi equities, its first banking license since 2004, people with knowledge of the matter said last September. The bank is directly investing in companies listed on the Saudi stock exchange after the bourse opened to direct foreign investment in June 2015. Citigroup joins banks including HSBC Holdings Plc and asset manager Ashmore Group in obtaining the license after the Arab world’s biggest stock market opened to direct foreign investment in June. Citigroup has also played a role advising on some of the largest deals involving Saudi firms, with bankers based outside the country working on Saudi Basic Industries Corp.’s acquisition of General Electric Co.’s plastics unit for $11.6 billion in 2007. It was also part of a group that loaned $10 billion to Aramco in 2015. “The bank now has a great deal of excess capital, and while it has no desire to use it unwisely, it is in the mood to invest," said Christopher Wheeler, a London-based analyst with Atlantic Equities LLP in London. "Boosting its role in Saudi as it opens up makes sense for a bank with one of the biggest, if not the biggest corporate and institutional banking platforms in the world."

The 25 Most Powerful Women in Finance 18. Elizabeth Myers, JPMorgan Chase September 25, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Related The 25 Most Powerful Women in Banking The 25 Women to Watch The 25 Most Powerful Women in Finance Q&A with Sallie Krawcheck The Circuit: The 'Daughters of Banking' Community Banker of the Year: Heritage Oaks' Simone Lagomarsino Head of Global Equity Capital Markets J.P. Morgan, JPMorgan Chase One of the hardest parts of managing nearly 200 people around the world is getting them to work together as if they are all in the same room. Elizabeth "Liz" Myers has teams in New York, San Francisco, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney, and London. But no matter the region where they are, J.P. Morgan bankers have to be thinking globally, much as their clients are. To help facilitate that process, Myers convened a two-day gathering of her managing directors last year so they could discuss clients' needs. The event is now in its third year and is expected to be annual. The results of such face time are notable. "Each year there's at least one major cross-border transaction which is won subsequently as a result of in-person connectivity across regions," Myers said. For example, a Chinese client, working with J.P. Morgan in Hong Kong, had a subsidiary in Austria. Although most companies like to go public where they are headquartered, in this case executives at the Chinese company felt investors might more receptive to the offering if it was done in Europe, because of so many similar companies being based there. At the senior global meeting, the Hong Kong bankers were able to discuss the opportunity with their European counterparts. While things like teleconferencing has made worldwide communication easier, Myers says real face time still works better. "You can have all the technology in the world," Myers said. "But you're still confronted with time zones." Earlier this year Myers also developed a private capital markets business that offers clients capital-raising alternatives such as pre-IPO financing, acquisition financing and private investments in public equity. The team, which is U.S. focused for now, completed four deals within the first four months since its formation.

The 25 Most Powerful Women in Finance 16. Kelly Coffey, JPMorgan Chase September 25, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Related The 25 Most Powerful Women in Banking The 25 Women to Watch The 25 Most Powerful Women in Finance Q&A with Sallie Krawcheck The Circuit: The 'Daughters of Banking' Community Banker of the Year: Heritage Oaks' Simone Lagomarsino CEO of U.S. Private Bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co On the wall in Kelly Coffey's office at JPMorgan Chase is a quote from Jeff Bezos: "We're not competitor obsessed, we're customer obsessed. We start with what the customer needs and we work backwards." In modified form — "we should obsess over our clients" — the quote crops up in most of her quarterly town halls and leadership meetings. It embodies an ethos that Coffey tries to instill in her workforce. Managing someone's personal wealth, she reminds advisers, is a great privilege. And when it comes to people like those on the Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans — more than half of whom are U.S. Private Bank clients — the financial plans advisers put in place will likely have an impact far beyond the current generation. Noticing that clients were placing more emphasis on planning for specific goals than on simple returns and performance benchmarks, Coffey oversaw the development of a new wealth management platform, launched earlier this year, to help them project future wealth, monitor and adjust their portfolios, and deploy surplus assets. No two clients are alike, and Coffey, who sees her managerial role as that of a "player-coach," spends a lot of time figuring out how to provide tailored solutions to corporate executives, businesses owners and families with inherited wealth. "Kelly has led the charge in making sure our client conversations are advice-driven, not product-focused," said Phil Di Iorio, Coffey's boss and the CEO of the global wealth management division. Growing a wealth management business today also means reaching newly affluent clients in markets where wealth is accumulating rapidly, such as South Florida, and there, too, Coffey has "done a terrific job," Di Iorio said.

The 25 Most Powerful Women in Finance 12. Joyce Chang, JPMorgan Chase September 25, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Related The 25 Most Powerful Women in Banking The 25 Women to Watch The 25 Most Powerful Women in Finance Q&A with Sallie Krawcheck The Circuit: The 'Daughters of Banking' Community Banker of the Year: Heritage Oaks' Simone Lagomarsino Global Head of Research, Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan Though some other investment banks have scaled back equity research efforts in recent times, Joyce Chang has successfully led continued investment and expansion at J.P. Morgan. The 950 research professionals she oversees at the investment banking unit of JPMorgan Chase cover more than 3,700 companies worldwide and provide economic forecasts for more than 60 countries. The team also produces 400 pieces of research each day for its 23,000 clients. But Chang said the focus is on quality even more so than quantity, including research calls contrary to the market consensus. Two notable examples include a call that bonds would outperform equity markets and that the equity market would outperform developed markets, despite signs of deterioration that could suggest otherwise. Last year Chang became co-chair of the Women's Network at J.P. Morgan's Corporate and Investment Bank. The program provides sponsorship, technical training, job opportunities and client events for more than 700 women. The goal is to retain, develop and promote senior female talent at the managing director and executive director level. For 2016, Chang is helping spread those efforts outside the company and around the world. She formed an external advisory committee — which includes representatives from Catalyst, 100 Women in Hedge Funds and Womensphere — to help share best practices and explore new avenues to promote diversity globally. Another one of Chang's projects outside of work over the past year has been helping immigrants gain access to financial services. In May, she received the Justice and Opportunity Award from the New York Immigration Coalition for her involvement in the annual National Immigrant Integration Conference, which brings together nonprofit organizations to empower immigrant and refugee entrepreneurs through financial inclusion.

The 25 Women to Watch 10. Thasunda Duckett, JPMorgan Chase September 25, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Related The 25 Women to Watch 2015: No. 11: Thasunda Duckett, JPMorgan Chase The 25 Most Powerful Women in Banking The 25 Women to Watch The 25 Most Powerful Women in Finance CEO, Chase Auto Finance, JPMorgan Chase Inspiring others is what motivates Thasunda Duckett to keep taking on challenging new assignments. Duckett held several top mortgage-lending jobs at JPMorgan Chase before she was named chief executive of the bank's auto finance arm in early 2013. On her watch, Chase Auto Finance has reported loan growth in every quarter and jumped from No. 5 in the rankings of the nation's largest auto lenders to No. 2 as of Dec. 31. Perhaps even more important, the financing unit moved from No. 27 to No. 16 in J.D. Power's annual customer satisfaction ratings, largely due to Duckett's efforts to simplify and speed up the loan-application process and improve overall service. Still, for Duckett, it's not really about the numbers. What drives her to succeed is knowing that she is a role model for thousands of other JPMorgan staffers, particularly women and minorities. Duckett, who is African-American, speaks frequently about leadership and development at JPMorgan Chase events and she is an enthusiastic mentor to women and men of color, both inside and outside of the bank. Three years ago, she started a foundation — named after her parents, Otis and Rosie Brown — to help provide academic opportunities to economically disadvantaged families in north Texas. "When I'm mentoring people, yes it's helping them, but it's also helping me because it's what motivates me," she said. "I truly believe that my purpose in life is to inspire people." Duckett said the key bits of advice she offers to up-and-coming leaders are to never lose confidence and that real success requires some sacrifice. But, she tells them, "never sacrifice your health, your family or your character."

Rachel Graf Sep 26, 2016 10:23 AM EDT NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of Deutsche Bank  (DB) were down 5.96% to $11.99 in early-morning trading on Monday following a report from the German magazine Focus that Chancellor Angela Merkel has decided against providing state aid to the German lender ahead of the national election in September 2017. Investors are concerned that Deutsche Bank will need to raise capital as it has entered negotiations with the  U.S. Justice Department regarding a $14 billion settlement over mortgage-backed securities. The bank held just $6.2 billion in litigation reserves as of June 30, according to the Wall Street Journal. JPMorgan (JPM) agreed in 2013 to a $13 billion settlement with the Justice Department regarding bad mortgages, but the New York City-based bank had about $28 billion in reserves going into the negotiations, TheStreet's Jim Cramer pointed out on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" this morning. "Deutsche Bank for many years did not think this would ever lead to anything big, so if you look at their reserves they're dramatically smaller," Cramer said.  He added that Deutsche Bank has been very naive about its negotiations with the Justice Department. When the Justice Department was negotiating settlements with U.S.-based banks a few years ago, they all knew not to speak with the press, Cramer noted. The bank has long believed that America will "play fair," Cramer stated. But unlike the U.S. banks, Deutsche Bank doesn't have many employees in America, and the Justice Department might therefore be less concerned about layoffs. "I don't know how much the Justice Department cares whether Deutsche Bank stays or goes," Cramer said.

Cramer created the acronym FANG for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, now under the parent name of Alphabet. The new abbreviation of FAAA represents Facebook, Alibaba, Alphabet and Amazon. "We have to talk about how these FAAA stocks got their groove back in order to figure out what it means for them going forward as we head into the fourth quarter," the "Mad Money" host said. On Tuesday, JPMorgan raised its 2017 year-end price targets for FANG stocks, noting that investors have returned to the group in search of growth. While many investors may question why they should care about 2017 year-end targets when it's not even the end of 2016 yet, Cramer clarified why it's important for those seeking growth. "Real growth investors don't particularly care about this year's numbers because classic high-growth stocks always look expensive on the near-term estimates. But if things go right, they will turn out to be very cheap once we get to the out-years," Cramer said. With the exception of Alphabet's rumored interest in acquiring Twitter, FAAA to Cramer represents the complete package. Some investors speculated that it was an act of desperation for Alphabet, but Cramer disagreed. "If you're looking at Twitter as it is now, a funny place to tweet and try to sound clever, then you're right, it's too expensive already at $23," Cramer said, "But if you look at Twitter as the ultimate customer retention weapon and predictor of consumer behavior, it might actually be cheap to some of these suitors even half a dozen points higher." Facebook already knows more about its customers than any other website, but if Twitter cleaned its act up, Cramer thinks it could be a reasonable stand-in. Win McNamee | Getty Images Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump Cramer found Donald Trump's talks of keeping jobs in America a noble goal, but the argument has a flipside that both Trump and Hillary Clinton have failed to address. "These trade deals that ship American jobs overseas also have an upside for the American consumer: lower prices on just about everything. It's a bargain, some would say an unholy bargain, but this tradeoff is very real and it needs to be explored," he said. At the same time, the countries that have taken jobs from the U.S., like Mexico and China, have created a large amount of pollution and have gotten away with it. Should this be allowed? Should there be some sort of pollution tax on those goods? Those are the economic questions that Cramer would like answered. Unfortunately, he does not have faith that the current political campaign will produce answers. "It's our loss — I just wish American politics allowed for this kind of rational discussion," Cramer said. Cramer also turned his attention to the pharmaceutical industry, particularly Bristol-Myers Squibb. To him, Bristol-Myers is a classic example of a stock that is immunized from the Fed, economy or the price of oil. After reporting disappointing lung cancer data on its flagship oncology drug in August, Bristol-Myers was crushed, falling 16 percent in a single session. It has since trended lower, with investors losing faith in its anti-cancer franchise. To gain further insight on where the stock could be headed, Cramer decided to take a closer look at the charts with the help of Tim Collins, a technician and colleague of Cramer's at RealMoney.com. Collins found that Bristol-Myers could be ready to bottom. While there is no guarantee that it's done going down, he liked the risk-reward of betting on the rebound. Patricia Marroquin | Getty Images Airstream camper The IPO market finally had traction last week with eight new deals hitting the tape, and e.l.f. Beauty came public with a bang, roaring up 55 percent in the first day of trading. It has since pulled back, leading Cramer to question if this is a perilous stock or one to buy. Cramer found that while e.l.f. has a great cosmetics concept and more room to expand, he was concerned that it skyrocketed so fast out of the gate. "ELF's intriguing, but I would rather wait for a lower level. And while you wait, why not pick up some Ulta Salon, which has pulled back nicely in recent weeks and remains the ultimate non-Amazonable beauty investment," Cramer said. Thor Industries solidified its position as the No. 1 maker of recreational vehicles (RVs) and motor homes on Tuesday when it posted a record year for RV sales in its fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 results. In an interview with Thor's CEO Bob Martin on Tuesday, the "Mad Money" host noted that while housing levels are nowhere near where they were in 2006, RVs have surpassed levels achieved then. Martin attributed the rapid growth of RVs to consumer confidence and more wholesale and retail lenders in the RV space. "That, along with just watching the younger buyers flock to the RV lifestyle, it really has helped to give our dealers the confidence to buy more inventory and to sell more at the shows. It has been definitely a positive for us," Martin said. In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on a few caller favorite stocks: Panera Bread: "On actionalertsplus.com we put out a very special bulletin today including Panera, and why the stock has been weak. We're talking about the idea, sadly, that the whole restaurant group is under fire. That's what we think it is, more about the group." Cyberark: "Cyberark is my second favorite. My favorite is Fortinet."

But Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) has built a lasting empire — and made many people very rich in the process. Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 760.91 +4.51 +0.60% Global Yellow Pages Ltd AWS ▼ 0.1610 -0.0090 -5.29% Tesla Motors Inc TSLA ▼ 186.50 -2.16 -1.14% Amazon stock has logged an astounding 47,000%-plus gain during its existence, and it’s now worth $387 billion by market capitalization. And yet, AMZN still feels like a scrappy startup. During the past 12 months, it has been one of the biggest gainers among large-cap stocks (up roughly 55%). Even Facebook Inc (FB) has only gained 40% in the past year. And it has done so not just on the back of its giant retail operations, but thanks to explosive growth in cloud services and expansion in streaming video. Can Amazon stock keep up the momentum? JPMorgan certainly thinks so — its analysts boosted their price target on AMZN from $925 to a nice, clean $1,000 on Tuesday. That would be a return of more than 20% from today’s prices. Earlier this month, RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney also predicted Amazon shares would hit $1,000. I’m completely on board with this bullishness on Amazon stock. Here are three reasons why: #1: Amazon, The E-Commerce Juggernaut Amazon has spent billions of dollars building its e-commerce platform — not just website development, but building warehouses, installing logistics systems and even deploying robots. AMZN also was smart in developing the Prime program — not just for the one-hour delivery, but because add-on services such as music and video help engage users. 10 Stocks That Should Be in Your Portfolio Right Now All in all, Amazon has built an enormous moat that most rivals can’t touch. According to eMarketer, AMZN controls nearly three-quarters of the U.S. e-commerce market. Wal-Mart Stores (WMT)? Try 3%. E-commerce still is a growth market, too. Based on research from Forrester, e-commerce sales are forecast to improve from $344 billion in 2015 to $480 billion by 2019. Consumers are shifting their buying habits, moving away from traditional brick-and-mortar operators like Macy’s, Inc. (M) to digital platforms. Amazon stock should reap the benefits this holiday season, just like the rest. In anticipation of the spurt in revenues, AMZN has opened 18 new fulfillment centers, up from just six last year. It’s just prudent planning. After all, Signal and Shift Communications say about 43% of internet users already are thinking about using Amazon as their primary holiday shopping source. 2. Amazon Web Services (AWS) One longstanding knock against Amazon stock was the company’s long history of net losses. But these are becoming a thing of the past. For the past five quarters, AMZN has pumped out profits — including three quarterly earnings that reached record levels. Yes, the aforementioned e-commerce business remains a low-margin category. But Amazon is countering that with its high-margin Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, which provides cloud services to businesses. In the latest quarter, AWS revenues spiked from $1.82 billion to $2.89 billion. That’s nice. Operating income came to a $718 million. That’s just flat-out juicy. The cloud market represents a megatrend in the tech industry. The technology tends to be cheaper than legacy systems, but allows for better analytics and training with less overall maintenance. Amazon isn’t alone. Alphabet (GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) are ramping their cloud efforts, too. The prospects look bright for this part of the market, with Morgan Stanley predicting that global spending will jump from $70 billion last year to $141 billion by 2019. 3. Jeff Bezos Has Been Great for Amazon Stock Jeff Bezos is one the world’s best CEOs. During the past two decades, he has fended off scores of tough competitors (and even buried a few), and survived grueling recessions and tech busts. A key to his success has certainly been the undeniable focus on his customers. He once summed up his thinking with this little phrase: “Put the customer first. Invent. And be patient.” Bezos hasn’t won on every front, of course. Anyone remember the ill-fated Fire Phone? But innovators rarely have unscathed records, and Bezos has plenty of success — like the Kindle and Echo — to make up for the failures. How Tesla Motors (TSLA) Turned a Hack Into a Competitive Advantage Bezos also has a good sense of finding breakout opportunities, such as AWS, which he built from scratch and turned into a cash cow in roughly a decade. That’s ultimately what will move the needle for Amazon stock.
