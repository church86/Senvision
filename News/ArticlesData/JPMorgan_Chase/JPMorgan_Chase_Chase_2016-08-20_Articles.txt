By Kedar Grandhi August 20, 2016 11:43 BST JPMorgan as part of the settlment would receive $645mReuters JPMorgan Chase & Co has settled a legal dispute with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) and Deutsche Bank. The American bank revealed the same on Friday (19 August) and said it would receive $645m (£493m) in settlement of litigation. The lawsuit was relating to JPMorgan's purchase of Washington Mutual's (WaMu) banking operations during the 2008 financial crisis. WaMu had been America's largest savings and loan bank before FDIC seized it. The independent agency then sold WaMu's banking operations to JPMorgan for about $1.9bn (£1.45bn), before the parent holding company of WaMu filed for bankruptcy protection. The three companies have since been fighting over who would take responsibility for the alleged defects in WaMu's mortgage underwriting at the time of the crisis. JPMorgan sued the FDIC in 2013. It claimed the agency to be responsible for more than $1bn in liabilities. The bank argued that the FDIC had agreed to protect it from all liabilities that would arise from WaMu. On the other hand Deutsche Bank too had filed against the FDIC and JPMorgan over losses arising from WaMu's defected mortgage underwriting. Trustee Deutsche Bank oversees 99 trusts that hold residential mortgage securities backed by WaMu's home loans. JPMorgan would receive the $645m settlement from the estate of Washington Mutual Bank, which was placed into receivership with the FDIC in 2008. In exchange the New York City based bank said it would drop $1bn worth of claims. Deutsche Bank will also have a claim against the estate, JPMorgan added, according to Reuters. According to Bloomberg, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has said he would have bargained for a much lower price for WaMu, had he known there would be unexpected legal costs involved. The settlement resolves claims worth billions of dollars between the three parties. The settlement is however now subject to court approval. If it gets the approval, the settlement will mark the end of four WaMu-related lawsuits involving the bank and the FDIC in the Washington, DC federal court.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel JPMorgan Chase & Co said it will receive USD 645 million in a settlement of litigation with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and Deutsche Bank AG arising from its purchase of Washington Mutual Inc's banking operations during the financial crisis in 2008. According to a regulatory filing, JPMorgan will collect the cash payment from the estate of Washington Mutual Bank, for which the FDIC acts as receiver. In exchange, JP Morgan, the largest US bank by assets said it will drop its more than USD 1 billion in claims related to the Washington Mutual (WaMu) purchase. JPMorgan also said Deutsche Bank, the trustee overseeing 99 trusts holding residential mortgage securities backed by soured WaMu home loans, will have a claim against the estate. JPMorgan had filed lawsuits seeking to force the FDIC to indemnify it on claims relating to the WaMu purchase, in which it also assumed some of the thrift's liabilities. Deutsche Bank had filed a USD 10 billion lawsuit against the FDIC and JPMorgan over losses stemming from alleged defects in WaMu's mortgage underwriting. JPMorgan said the settlement requires court approval, and would end four WaMu-related lawsuits involving the bank and the FDIC, and pending in the federal court in Washington, D.C. The bank and the FDIC have long fought over who is liable to investors for claims arising from Seattle-based WaMu's collapse. WaMu had been nation's largest savings and loan before the FDIC seized it on Sept. 25, 2008 and sold its banking operations to New York-based JPMorgan for about USD 1.9 billion.

Dollar bond sales in Asia excluding Japan reached $23.9 billion since June 30, 48 percent up from the $16.2 billion in the same period of 2015, according to Bloomberg data. That’s a record for the period. The extra yield over Treasuries that investors demand to hold U.S. currency notes from the region’s issuers slid 21 basis points this month to 204 on Aug. 16, the lowest since 2007, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.

You will now receive the Technology newsletter “We expect the momentum to stay strong for the rest of the year driven by the robust investor demand for higher-yielding assets in today’s low rate environment,” said Mark Follett, Hong Kong-based head of Debt Capital Markets for Asia excluding Japan at JPMorgan, which ranks sixth in managing Asia ex-Japan dollar bond sales in 2016. “Relative to many parts of the world, Asian credit in general offers better stability and return for an equivalent rating profile, and this will further support the strength of the demand.” Global investors are flooding into Asian corporate bonds after sovereign yields from Japan to Germany dropped below zero. The 3.7 percent yuan depreciation for the past year is also luring Chinese funds into the Asian dollar bond market. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimated foreign-exchange outflows out of China climbed to $55 billion in July, from $49 billion in June. Rising Demand Odds of an increase in U.S. borrowing costs by year-end stand at 47 percent, down from 51 percent on Tuesday, according to futures trading data compiled by Bloomberg. “We don’t anticipate any expectations on the Fed’s next move will have a major impact on financing costs in the near term,” said Follett. “Demand for credit will have a greater impact on pricing than underlying rates.” Chinese investors’ demand for Asian dollar bonds has been on the rise in the past six to 12 months, Ben Yuen, fixed income chief investment officer at BOCHK Asset Management, said at a press briefing this month. Firms from China sold $13.7 billion of dollar bonds in the offshore market this quarter, up from $11.2 billion in the same period of 2015, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The previous three quarters’ sales all declined from the year-earlier periods. “Chinese companies’ offshore dollar bond sales in the second half may exceed that in the first half of this year, especially high-yield property developers,” said Xie Tong, China head of debt capital markets at JPMorgan, in a phone interview from Beijing. “The low borrowing costs would encourage other high-yield issuers, who are still watching, to sell bonds offshore.” — With assistance by Lianting Tu, and Judy Chen Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Six years later, UPB needs more cash to survive, but it's looking closer to home for help. The South Side bank, at $602 million in assets less than a third the size of predecessor ShoreBank at its peak, has launched a campaign to raise at least $15 million in fresh equity. UPB Chairman David Vitale, better known to Chicagoans as Mayor Rahm Emanuel's former chairman of the Chicago Board of Education, is meeting with CEOs of locally headquartered banks like Northern Trust, PrivateBancorp, Wintrust Financial and MB Financial to help bail out the bank. UPB is operating under an Aug. 5 consent order with state and federal bank regulators that requires it to raise capital and pursue a new business plan. UPB has not earned a profit since its inception. For Vitale, who spent most of his career as an executive at First Chicago and Bank One, the challenge will be to convince local banking chiefs that UPB won't just be back to them in a few years, hat in hand, after burning through their capital. Photo by Urban Partnership Bank David Vitale After all, UPB has blown through more than $100 million of the Wall Street cash it got in 2010. “I feel pretty good,” Vitale says, adding with wryness, “Last time it was $150 (million); this time it's $15.” “The general response has been, 'We should find a way to support you,' “ he says. “Nobody has said, 'Don't send me the (investment) package.' “ The other big challenge is that, unlike ShoreBank's former leaders—who attempted to transfer what had been a successful lending model on Chicago's South Side to other parts of the country and the world—UPB's ambitions are small-scale. It's focusing on making $40 million to $50 million in small commercial real estate and business loans each year on the South and West sides of Chicago and in Detroit. “It isn't the same,” says William Michael Cunningham, social investing adviser at Creative Investment Research, a Washington, D.C.-based firm focused on minority banking. “They don't have that same record of innovation ShoreBank had.” UPB's branch network also is substantially smaller than ShoreBank's was, and it won't lend to consumers. The business plan “will be more focused on what we've proven we can do, which is commercial origination,” Vitale says. The main appeal to local bankers, who otherwise might be underwhelmed, is that an investment in UPB will give their banks credit with federal regulators for helping underserved neighborhoods as they're required to do under the Community Reinvestment Act. Their effective choice: Build their own branches in parts of the city they might prefer to avoid or help prop up UPB, which already is serving many of those areas. One banker Vitale has contacted, who asked not to be identified, says CRA credit is attractive, but the fear is that, once a bank is an investor, it will be pressured to contribute again if UPB gets in trouble. Vitale's response to those concerns has been to emphasize that the ShoreBank woes are in the past. UPB now has an agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to end its arrangement to share losses on the old ShoreBank loans. Earlier this year, UPB sold off virtually all the old ShoreBank mortgages on its books. But he acknowledges UPB didn't properly assess what digging out of ShoreBank's hole would cost. UPB projected that about $50 million of the $150 million it raised from Goldman Sachs et al. would cover the ShoreBank losses. The actual figure was double that. The cost of managing the nearly $1 billion portfolio was far more than UPB anticipated, Vitale says. Loan losses were worse than expected as well. “Home values (in UPB's neighborhoods) continued to go down for three to four years,” he says. “We didn't see it bottom until 2014.” Quietly, Vitale says, UPB has had a big impact on the South and West sides. “For the last four years, we've put $300 million of capital into these neighborhoods.” In addition to the locally headquartered banks, on Vitale's speed dial are super-regional banks with big Chicago presences like Cincinnati-based Fifth Third, Minneapolis' U.S. Bank and PNC Financial in Pittsburgh. BMO Harris Bank, a unit of Toronto-based BMO Financial Group, and local insurance titans State Farm and Allstate are targets as well. PNC, BMO Harris, U.S. Bank, Northern Trust and State Farm all contributed to the 2010 launch of UPB. BMO Harris Bank Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. J. P. Morgan Chase & Co. RL ShoreBank Corp.

The agency affirmed the country’s rating at “BBB-,” a notch above junk grade. The rating is in line with Moody’s Investors Service, which has placed it on review for a possible downgrade while it assesses the impact of the military takeover attempt. S&P Global Ratings lowered Turkey one level to “BB,” two steps below investment grade, on July 20. UTILITIES State Grid ‘disappointed’ China’s State Grid Corp (國家電網) — the world’s biggest utility — on Friday said it “deeply regrets” Australia’s decision to stop the company from buying a majority stake in the state-owned power network Ausgrid. The company said it agreed to participate in the bidding after an invitation from the New South Wales government in November last year and has “absolutely” followed the guidance and conditions set by the seller through to submission of the final paperwork. “We find it hard to understand and are very disappointed” that bidders were rejected on the pretext of national security at a very late stage, the state-owned company said in a statement. BANKING JPMorgan wins lawsuit JPMorgan Chase & Co, the biggest US bank, is to be paid US$645 million from a receivership estate to end a dispute over who was responsible for toxic securities created by a failed bank acquired during the financial crisis. The agreement with Deutsche Bank AG and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp was signed on Friday, New York-based JPMorgan said in a regulatory filing. It resolves claims among the three parties over more than US$6 billion in securities backed by flawed Washington Mutual Inc mortgages. The agreement is subject to judicial approval. COSMETICS Estee Lauder outlook glum Estee Lauder Cos provided a full-year profit forecast that trailed analysts’ estimates, citing economic turbulence and a stronger dollar that are hurting its sales overseas. Profit would be US$3.38 to US$3.44 per share, excluding some items, in the year through June, the New York-based company said on Friday. While Estee Lauder’s outlook was glum, its profit for the latest quarter topped analysts’ expectations. Earnings were US$0.43 per share, excluding some items, beating the US$0.40 average estimate. Revenue was US$2.65 billion, just missing the US$2.66 billion average projection, hurt by a 0.7 percent drop in skincare sales. BANKING RBS clients to pay interest Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (RBS), Britain’s largest taxpayer-owned lender, said some of its biggest trading clients must pay interest on collateral as a consequence of low central-bank interest rates. Some of the bank’s institutional clients would need to pay interest on funds pledged as collateral when trading futures contracts, the bank said on Friday. The changes for pound and euro futures and options trading would probably affect about 60 large clients, a person with knowledge of the matter said earlier on Friday.

JPMorgan ends WaMu disputes with FDIC, to receive $645 million Reuters 8/19/2016 By Jonathan Stempel © REUTERS/Mike Segar A view of the exterior of the JP Morgan Chase & Co. Corporate headquarters in the Manhattan borough of New York Quotes in the article JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▲ 78.85 +0.32 +0.40% JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM) on Friday said it will receive $645 million in a settlement of litigation with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) arising from its purchase of Washington Mutual Inc's banking operations during the financial crisis in 2008. According to a regulatory filing, JPMorgan will collect the cash payment from the estate of Washington Mutual Bank, for which the FDIC acts as receiver. In exchange, JP Morgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets said it will drop its more than $1 billion in claims related to the Washington Mutual (WaMu) purchase. JPMorgan also said Deutsche Bank, the trustee overseeing 99 trusts holding residential mortgage securities backed by soured WaMu home loans, will have a claim against the estate. JPMorgan had filed lawsuits seeking to force the FDIC to indemnify it on claims relating to the WaMu purchase, in which it also assumed some of the thrift's liabilities. Deutsche Bank had filed a $10 billion lawsuit against the FDIC and JPMorgan over losses stemming from alleged defects in WaMu's mortgage underwriting. JPMorgan said the settlement requires court approval, and would end four WaMu-related lawsuits involving the bank and the FDIC, and pending in the federal court in Washington, D.C. The bank and the FDIC have long fought over who is liable to investors for claims arising from Seattle-based WaMu's collapse. WaMu had been nation's largest savings and loan before the FDIC seized it on Sept. 25, 2008 and sold its banking operations to New York-based JPMorgan for about $1.9 billion. The parent holding company of WaMu filed for bankruptcy protection. FDIC spokesman David Barr and Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Oksana Poltavets declined to comment.   (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Cynthia Osterman) Go to MSN Home More in Money 7 successful icons who had a brush with bankruptcy InvestorPlace 20 best money tips of all time from Tony Robbins GOBankingRates 7 CEOs heading to the chopping block InvestorPlace The most dangerous states in America 24/7 Wall St. 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney 12 leaders who took $1 salaries Money Up Next What the richest 1 percent earns in every state Money Talks News AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More From Reuters Should I stay or should I go?

The agreement with Deutsche Bank AG and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. was signed Friday, New York-based JPMorgan said in a regulatory filing. It resolves claims among the three parties over more than $6 billion in securities backed by flawed Washington Mutual Inc. mortgages. JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has said that he would have demanded a much lower price for Washington Mutual given the unexpected legal costs from that deal and the acquisition of Bear Stearns Cos. The takeovers, done during the crisis, saddled the bank with billions of dollars of litigation and regulatory expenses. JPMorgan sued the FDIC in 2013, claiming the agency was responsible for more than $1 billion in liabilities faced by the company as a result of its 2008 takeover of Washington Mutual’s bank. JPMorgan had argued that the FDIC agreed to shield it from liability tied to failures by Washington Mutual. JPMorgan said it will drop its claims and receive $645 million in cash. The agreement is subject to judicial approval. A tentative deal was disclosed this month in a JPMorgan filing. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

And yet, perhaps remarkably given the circumstances, across the city it was transatlantic business as usual. As the Brexit result unfolded across the Pond on the night of June 23, the New York-London business community was keeping its cool. “These are sophisticated players,” explained Antonia Romeo, the Government’s newly appointed British consul general in the Big Apple, who also holds the new title of director-general economic and commercial affairs USA. “No one is going to panic.” Her role involves overseeing British trade policy across the US; her ambition, she said, is to “rocket boost” British-US trade. And, despite the vote to leave the EU, she insisted that most of the business and financial leaders she talks to are remaining calm. “There is definitely no sense that this is a crisis. These are organisations that have been through global crises. And I think there is more of a sense of waiting for the dust to settle.” Antonia Romeo, the first female Consul General of New York, in her office at the British Consulate in Midtown Manhattan Credit: Neville Elder Britain’s existing business links with the US were, of course, never in doubt. The US is the UK’s largest single trading partner and the destination for 20pc of all UK exports. The two countries are each other’s largest investors and foreign job creators. As of the end of 2014, according to the CBI, the UK had invested $449bn (£341bn) in the US – $76bn more than the next largest investor, Japan, and nearly $200bn more than America’s neighbour, Canada. This represents a weighty 15pc share of the $2.9 trillion of foreign direct investment in America. Indian and Chinese investment was much smaller – combined, it did not even approach 1pc. British companies supported more than one million jobs across America, while Britain was last year the fourth-largest destination for US exports for a second year running, and the largest within the EU by a substantial margin. And yet, it is precisely because of those close ties that the waves from the Brexit storm are being felt on American shores – particularly on the East Coast, with Wall Street bearing the brunt. Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase, the country’s largest bank by assets, contributed £500,000 each to the Remain campaign. Citigroup and Morgan Stanley donated £250,000. The day after the vote, Citigroup chief executive Mike Corbat said “while the result was not what we would have preferred, our diligent work over the past six months means we can be confident that Citi is well positioned to serve our clients”. Jamie Dimon, JP Morgan Chase chief executive, told his employees the bank would maintain a large presence throughout Britain – but warned of possible relocation. Prior to the vote he had said up to 4,000 jobs could move. Romeo, whose office in Midtown Manhattan is within sight of the Lower Manhattan skyscrapers of Wall Street, insisted, however, there was little sense of a rush for the exits. Her job is to relay concerns from US firms, especially financial ones in New York, back to Whitehall. “There is no doubt that there is uncertainty,” she said. An economist by trade, who studied PPE at Oxford and obtained an MSc in economics at the London School of Economics, she worked in the private sector before joining the civil service in 2000. “I see my job right now as minimising that uncertainty in the transition. “I spend a lot of my time talking to people over here about that. And understanding from them, really, what they would want from the terms of the deal.” Financial behemoths are not just in the UK for its position in the EU, she insisted. The vast majority, by her telling, are also there for the talent pool, the language, legal system, business infrastructure, communications and way of life. “They say they feel optimistic about the Government’s focus on maintaining the UK as a highly competitive economy. And I think that’s important,” she said. “So right now what we can do is reassure them that we absolutely value UK growth. What we are all about is growth in the UK economy. And understanding from them. So it’s less negotiation, and more listening.” The UK has been a trusted friend of the US for decades and that won’t changeRonald Kent Bankers with interests in the US were, perhaps, less confident. One told the Sunday Telegraph that banking chiefs were weighing up why they were in the UK, and what has changed. Ronald Kent, the British Bankers’ Association’s managing director for financial and wholesale policy, said: “The UK has been a trusted friend of the US for decades and that won’t change.” He added: “There is no doubt the USA is going to become more important to the UK, but the US, as a global powerhouse, will only partially be more interested in the UK than it already is.” Portrayals of banks as being able to set up shop in any country they choose are a myth; most people, he said, underestimated the costs and complexity of moving from a well-regulated system like Britain into one in the EU which was less clearly defined. Away from financial hubs, the picture is more nuanced. British businesses create jobs in every single US state. Texas leads the way, with 102,200 jobs supported by British companies, followed by California and New York. New York had the largest share of exports to the UK by state, totalling $5.9bn in 2015. Gareth Wade is chairman of the British-American Business Council for the Pacific Northwest, meaning he represents Silicon Valley, as well as aerospace giants such as Boeing and Rolls-Royce, which have a large presence in Washington State. “I think people here are taking quite a pragmatic approach now,” he said. “They realise it will be at least two years until there are any major changes. “And the longer-term view is that the UK still offers a business-friendly environment. Of course there’s a bit of spin from the British Government, trying to make the UK appear attractive. But I genuinely believe people are interested in the depth of trade with Britain.” He pointed to a June 30 Bill introduced by senators Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Mike Lee of Utah, urging the US to keep trading on exactly the same terms after the UK leaves the EU. The United Kingdom Trade Continuity Act has no power to compel the president to do anything, but is seen as a strong sign that the US prioritises closer economic relations with the UK, despite Barack Obama’s widely reported remarks in London that Britain would go “to the back of the queue” post-Brexit. Before the referendum someone asked me 'what will you do if Britain votes to leave'. I said, if there is an ‘out’ vote that makes my job the most interesting job in governmentAntonia Romeo Back in New York, next month the local chapter of British American Business (BAB) will host a conference on the subject of post-Brexit Britain.   The organisation represents more than 2,000 companies, from financial services to IMB and Ford. Jeffries Briginshaw, chief executive of BAB, says his members are asking about timelines for Brexit, and the possibilities of a US-UK trade deal. “There is no apocalyptic rush for the exits,” he said. “You can see why businesses are playing their cards slightly to their chests. But I don’t think we are seeing people acting dramatically, or seizing on their contingency plans.” His words will be music to Romeo’s ears. In her first fortnight she was visited by Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, and Liam Fox, Secretary of State for International Trade. “The Foreign Secretary I think is going to be fantastic in terms of promoting the country as a global trading, outward-facing nation,” she said. Despite the uncertainty of Brexit, she says she is relishing the role; hoping to visit all 50 states, promote the consulate as a cultural and economic hub, and enjoy weekends exploring New York with her daughter and two sons, aged 13, 11 and eight. “I obviously accepted the job before the referendum was announced,” she said. “And someone did say to me what will you do if Britain votes to leave. And I said then, well if there is an ‘out’ vote that makes my job the most interesting job in government.” Follow Telegraph Business READ MORE ABOUT: Brexit UK economy Show more Business latest 23 Nov 2016, 8:06pm Autumn Statement 2016: The Telegraph's business panel gives its verdict 23 Nov 2016, 7:55pm Comment: Brexit Britain needed a radical vision, but timid Hammond played it safe Allister Heath Premium 01:35 23 Nov 2016, 7:43pm Autumn Statement 2016: Hammond's Speech unspun Premium 23 Nov 2016, 7:17pm Market report: Gold skids to nine-month low as dollar extends gains 23 Nov 2016, 7:07pm No relief for soaring business rates burden 00:38 23 Nov 2016, 6:56pm Britain’s debt mountain set to hit £2 trillion in the 2020s  23 Nov 2016, 6:46pm Thirteen things you need to know about the Autumn Statement  01:38 23 Nov 2016, 6:20pm Autumn Statement: Eurosceptic MPs accuses OBR of anti-Brexit forecasts as it says leaving EU will cost £60bn  23 Nov 2016, 6:18pm Comment: Hammond's fiscal blunder almost guarantees a hard-landing Ambrose Evans-Pritchard Premium 23 Nov 2016, 5:09pm Spring Statement and autumn Budget ahead as Hammond shakes up the fiscal calendar 23 Nov 2016, 4:22pm Autumn Statement 2016 calculator:  work out how your finances have changed 23 Nov 2016, 3:40pm Autumn Statement 2016: Five charts which show the state of the UK economy Premium 01:21 23 Nov 2016, 3:15pm When is Black Friday 2016 and who has the best deals? 23 Nov 2016, 2:47pm How the internet reacted to the Autumn Statement: The best tweets   23 Nov 2016, 2:43pm Phillip Hammond pledges to tackle the UK's productivity gap 23 Nov 2016, 2:37pm Comment: Phillip Hammond the cautious Chancellor failed to make any truly bold decisions Ben Wright Premium 51:36 23 Nov 2016, 1:39pm Autumn Statement 2016: The Chancellor's speech in full 01:32 23 Nov 2016, 1:38pm Autumn Statement 2016 summary and highlights: Everything you need to know 23 Nov 2016, 12:43pm Severn Trent outbid for Dee Valley Water amid jobs row 23 Nov 2016, 12:30pm House building contracts surge as industry shakes off post-referendum lull 23 Nov 2016, 12:18pm Hammerson expands European presence with outlet portfolio buy If you would like to add a comment, please register or log in Register Log in Contact us Rewards Archive Reader Prints Advertising Syndication Guidelines Privacy Terms and Conditions Leave your feedback © Telegraph Media Group Limited 2016

(Image: Alamy) Egypt expects its eurobond issuance at the end of September or early October to have a yield between 5.5 percent and 6 percent, Deputy Finance Minister for fiscal policies Ahmed Kojak told Reuters on Sunday. Egypt’s government this month approved plans for international issuance of between $3 billion and $5 billion. Last week Egypt appointed JPMorgan, Citi, BNP Paribas and Natixis to lead manage its international bond offering. “We aim to issue eurobonds worth $3 billion with interest rates ranging between 5.5 and 6 percent and with maturity of five to ten years,” Kojak said. “If we find great appetite and demand from investors for this issuance and at appropriate prices then we could increase the amount issued and we can lower the cost of the issuance if the interest rate prices offered are high,” he said.

A gentlemen's boutique in downtown Valparaiso is looking to be able to serve whisky at charitable events as it adapts to a changing retail landscape. Rusted Oak, a clothier at 19 Lincolnway, has received initial approval from the Indiana Alcohol and Tobacco Commission, to get a fraternal club liquor license that would let it offer whisky and other alcoholic drinks after after-hours fundraisers for local charities. Other stores such as Albert's Diamond Jewelers have staged events like whisky tastings and casino nights to lure in millennials, who marketers view as valuing experiences over possessions because of the popularity of social media sharing. It's one of a few changes the upscale menswear store in downtown Valparaiso is making at a time when retail giants like Macy's are closing scores of brick-and-mortar locations and dress codes are getting loosened in workplaces nationwide. "There's a big transition," said Rusted Oak owner Robert Ordway, a Lake Station native and Valparaiso University graduate. "The expectations of society have shifted for professional wardrobes. Brooks Brothers is no longer a staple." Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg popularized hoodies, and J.P. Morgan Chase no longer requires employees to wear ties if they're not at meetings. Rusted Oak specializes in custom suits and shoes, and tuxedo rentals for black tie events, but is broadening its offerings to include "athleisure" wear like golf clothes to cater to changing tastes. "Younger people are more into fitness and exercising a lot," he said. "They have unique muscular bodies. They're doing Crossfit. We're going back to the custom clothing we had 100 years ago. Customization allows the individual person to be better dressed for their lifestyle." Fifty years ago, most men in Northwest Indiana might have been steelworkers, but now they defy easy categorization, Ordway said. Steelworkers might dress up on Friday nights to take their wives out on the town. Lawyers might go deer hunting on weekends, and farmers might moonlight as musicians. Rusted Oak has worked to lure men in with a personalized shopping experience, as well as goods like beard oils, beard butter, private-label colognes and decorative whisky barrels. It also expanding to offer more women's clothing. "Women outspend men two to one in retail in this country," he said. "Women buy for fun, while men buy based on need." Retailers as a whole have been declining, closing stores and laying off workers nationwide. "Big box is dead," he said. "You have to sell the experience to be modern and stay relevant. Gone are the days of stack it high and watch it fly." That's why Ordway is asking the state for a liquor license similar to those the Elks and Oddfellows have so the boutique could have whisky tastings at private events to benefit local charities. Attendees to the in-store gales would buy tickets that would make them part of a private club, satisfying the state's fraternal club requirement. "Clothing can be purchased online, so you have to sell the experience as paramount to consumption," he said. "A whisky bar or barber drives foot traffic. It's a highly competitive, mature industry with a lot of shifts. You have to adapt." Ordway is also looking at kicking back a portion of store purchases to local charities like Kid's Alive International or the Gabriel Horn Homeless Shelter. Customers could play a plinko game to select one out of six nonprofits. "I've seen the very bad business model where someone will spend a hundred dollars and then you ask them for one dollar for the St. Jude Foundation," Ordway said. "The millennial generation is looking for new ways to get engaged with the community, and want to be connected with groups where they could invest their time, treasure and talent."

Hoosier Bat, Ublee Soda join Indiana Grown Two Valparaiso companies, Ublee Soda Co. and Hoosier Bat Co., have joined Indiana Grown, a state program that promotes Hoosier products. Shopping rush starts Thanksgiving day, though some stores closing Black Friday has crept forward to Thanksgiving over the last few years, but this year a number of retailers are pushing back.
