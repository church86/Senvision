Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf is going to have to leave his gig, it's just a matter of when. Sen. Elizabeth Warren lambasted Stumpf on Wednesday, calling for his resignation during his Capitol Hill appearance, but along with those calls for him to quit is a simple reality: He's likely out in 2018, no matter what. That year, he turns 65, and under company rules that is when senior executives usually leave the bank, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. So one way or another, Wells Fargo will likely be kicking off the hunt for a new CEO at some point in the next 12 months. When that search begins is likely to be influenced in part by Capitol Hill, but also by shareholders in the bank. One prominent analyst has an idea about who, or at least from where, Wells Fargo's next CEO could come. "JPMorgan Chase has been a proving ground for CEOs all over the country," said Rafferty Capital banking analyst Dick Bove. Specifically, Bove suggested that JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank CEO Daniel Pinto or consumer and community banking CEO Gordon Smith could take the lead role at Wells Fargo when Stumpf either retires or resigns. Wells Fargo and JPMorgan declined to comment when contacted by CNBC. Bove said he still believes Stumpf will make it to retirement, but acknowledged: "His performance" before the Senate Banking Committee this week "was abysmal." If Stumpf resigns, it would create a void within Wells Fargo that likely would not be filled by a current Wells Fargo executive, another industry source suggested to CNBC. Timothy Sloan, a Wells Fargo banker who was promoted from the CFO role to president and COO, was once considered a likely candidate to replace Stumpf. But the industry source suggested that because of the tarnish on the bank's brand in the wake of its unauthorized accounts scandal, it would be difficult to promote an insider to the CEO role now. Bove suggested that if the bank decides to replace Stumpf sooner rather than later, it may try to bring back the popular former CEO Richard Kovacevich as temporary chairman until a permanent CEO is found. Kovacevich is 72.

One of Berkshire Hathaway’s investment managers just got cozy with one of Wells Fargo’s biggest competitors. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Sep 21, 2016 at 6:08PM Image source: The Motley Fool. There's reason to believe that Wells Fargo's (NYSE:WFC) biggest shareholder, Warren Buffett, isn't pleased with the bank after learning that thousands of its employees opened as many as 2 million fraudulent accounts for consumers without the approval to do so between 2011 and 2015. No, the 86-year-old chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) hasn't said anything publicly to this effect. There's also no evidence to suggest that he's selling Berkshire's stake in the nation's third biggest bank by assets -- though, of course, he certainly could be. But what we do know is that one of Buffett's lieutenants, Todd Combs, agreed on Tuesday, the same day Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf was grilled by members of the Senate, to join the board of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Slap in the face? This probably goes without saying, but JPMorgan Chase is one of Wells Fargo's biggest competitors. On top of that, as Rafferty Capital Markets' Dick Bove pointed out to me, Combs' addition to the board of JPMorgan Chase eliminates any possibility that Berkshire will seek formal representation on Wells Fargo's board. By law, banks are prohibited from having interlocking directorships. This dates back a century ago to the days of the so-called money trust, when John Pierpont Morgan, the Rockefeller family, and a collection of their associates controlled many of the major banks in the country. It's worth pointing out, too, that while Buffett has claimed in the past to personally own JPMorgan Chase stock, he has never added it to Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Or is it something else? There are, of course, alternative rationales for the Berkshire's decision to allow Combs to join JPMorgan's board. It's long been known, for instance, that Buffett respects the bank's Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. They teamed up earlier this year to discuss, of all things, corporate governance. And Buffett has said in the past that he reads Dimon's annual shareholder letter as soon as it's published. It's also possible that Buffett wanted a lieutenant to sit on the board of a major, well-respected bank that Berkshire doesn't have a stake in. Perhaps this reduces liability. Maybe it's about optics. Or maybe it's a signal that Berkshire recently took a position in JPMorgan Chase, but just not reported it yet. Though, to be clear, this doesn't seem likely given Buffett's preference for quietly accumulating positions. Either way, to Bove's point, it's hard to imagine that the timing of the announcement, coinciding with Wells Fargo's public lambasting on Capital Hill, was a coincidence. That seems far-fetched.

Angela Merkel appears to be throwing a wrench in the works of Deutsche Bank's (DB)  plans to reduce a $14 billion penalty recently levied by the U.S. Justice Department, and this has sent the bank's shares to a record low in European trading on Monday. According to a report in Focus magazine, the German chancellor has no plans of aiding the German lender with its DoJ fine, which is tied to Deutsche Bank's role in issuing, distributing and securitizing residential mortgage-backed securities between 2005 and 2007. Merkel has also reportedly ruled out any German government assistance to Deutsche Bank ahead of next year's national elections. Shares of Deutsche Bank ended the day down about 7% in European trading and its New-York listed shares were down by almost 7% in mid-morning trading. "At no point has [Deutsche Bank CEO] John Cryan asked Chancellor Merkel to intervene in the RMBS issue with the US Department of Justice," a Deutsche Bank spokesperson said in a phone interview with Real Money. Investors are afraid the bank might have to raise fresh capital to cope with the financial demands that are made on it. Deutsche Bank representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The bank's hopes of substantially winding down the the $14 billion civil charges already seemed to be slight, given the German bank's out sized role in the never-ending "Big Short" saga relative to some of its banking peers. The DoJ did not comment when asked by Real Money for details about the amount and has not yet put out a statement, so investors have to rely only on what information is publicly available on the issue.  In repudiating the DoJ's hefty penalty, the struggling German bank said last week that it has "no intent" to pay "anywhere near" the proposed figure for its role in kindling the pre-crisis residential-mortgage market. But a history of similar settlements suggests forming a convincing counteroffer will be difficult. Deutsche Bank insiders quoted by The Financial Times have said the bank hopes it will be treated like Goldman Sachs (GS) , which ended up paying only about $5 billion, a slap on the wrist vs. the $16.6 billion and $13 billion that Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan (JPM) were forced to shell out, respectively. (Citigroup (C) and Morgan Stanley (MS) also arrived at comparatively small settlements, of $7 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively.)  The $14 billion punch could sure be crippling for Deutsche Bank shareholders, who've already seen almost half of the struggling bank's market cap vanish so far in 2016. After all, Deutsche Bank has put aside for litigation reserves only about 5.5 billion euros, or $6.1 billion, analysts with Toronto-based rating agency DBRS recently estimated. And the bank's total market cap is currently around just about $18 billion. And any attempt to get Goldman-like treatment could be tricky. In the pre-crisis housing market, Deutsche Bank appears to have been printing far more collateralized debt obligations. Deutsche created about $42.5 billion worth of the debt packages vs. about $25 billion by Goldman in 2007 alone, according to a 2010 Wall Street Journal report, which cited data compiled by Thomson Reuters. (Meanwhile, according to the report, Bank of America and JPMorgan issued about $65.5 billion and $44.3 billion in CDOs, respectively, over the period.) CDOs are bundles of asset-backed securities, in this case by residential mortgages. Originally designed to spread and reduce risk, instead they contributed to the financial crisis because investors were unable to assess the underlying assets when the housing market turned downward. The fact that Deutsche Bank issued more of them than Goldman in the year when the credit crunch started seems to suggest a deeper role for the German bank. Deutsche Bank representatives contacted by Real Money did not comment.  One of the striking similarities between the two banks is that they appear to have both allowed hedge fund billionaire John Paulson to bet against the housing market while promoting the market to clients. However, the Journal noted "a key difference" in their report: "Goldman told investors that the assets were picked by an independent third party; Deutsche didn't use a third party or give its investors any assurances." Both Goldman and Deutsche Bank were also market-makers for traders interested in shorting the housing market more broadly, as they acted in that capacity through the ABX credit-default index that was dramatized in both Michael Lewis's book The Big Short as well as the eponymous 2015 film, in which Ryan Gosling starred as a character based on the Deutsche Bank banker Greg Lippman, who helped establish the index. Other major investment banks that helped create the ABX index included Bank of America, Barclays (BCS) and Credit Suisse (CS) , among others. Another hurdle could be that Deutsche Bank is already under U.S. scrutiny, after having failed Federal Reserve stress tests, along with Santander (SAN) , in June, in which the central bank objected to "capital plans" because of "broad and substantial weaknesses across their capital planning processes, and insufficient progress these firms have made toward correcting those weaknesses."

Unexpected Champion of Public Clouds: JPMorgan CIO Dana Deasy By Penny Crosman September 22, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints "We aren't looking to decrease the amount of money the firm is spending on technology," says Dana Deasy at JPMorgan Chase. "We're looking to change the mix between run-the-bank costs versus innovation investment." Related Agile Development Is Reshaping Tech at Banks Like Chase and BBVA Why Tech-Savvy Banks Are Gung Ho About 'Container' Software Why Banks Are Finally Embracing Cloud Computing Banks Pushed Toward Cloud Computing By Cost Pressures Is It Almost Time to Put Core Processing in the Cloud? How Mobile Banking Is Raising Its Game Customer Experience Is the Tie that Binds Banks and Fintech 'More Sophisticated': Evolution of the Bank-Fintech Dialogue JPMorgan Chase's chief information officer, Dana Deasy, is making public cloud computing a significant part of the bank's IT strategy, a leap most U.S. banks have been too squeamish to take. By the second half of 2017, the bank plans to run proprietary applications on the public cloud. At the same time, it's building a new, modern internal cloud, code-named Gaia. The bank is so bullish on the use of internal and public cloud computing that in August it hired Harish Grama from IBM to be its CIO of cloud services. "We think we're the very first, at least in financial services, to do this," Deasy said in a recent interview. "The reason is simple: we're serious. Getting our CIO for the cloud in right now is the perfect timing — we're answering such questions as what use cases will be best for the public cloud, what would be best for our private cloud, how do we optimize the skillset of our developers for the public cloud, what's the right pace to do that?" Few large U.S. banks have publicly acknowledged such a firm commitment to using public cloud computing for anything other than common office applications like Salesforce. Largely due to regulatory, risk and security concerns, most have tiptoed around the public cloud, saying only that they do application testing in the public cloud and that they have a few cloud pilots. Cloud computing dramatically changes the IT organization and the way technology people work, Deasy noted. That's why JPMorgan recruited Grama. "We wanted a seasoned professional who's been there, done that, and knows what it takes to optimally leverage public and private cloud from the pure technical architecture and what works and what doesn't work," Deasy said. "And we wanted somebody who knew how to think through changing your workforce." Like most large U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase has had some version of a private cloud for years, with virtualized servers, storage and networks that can be shared in a flexible way throughout the organization. The bank is upgrading its private cloud to "platform as a service" — in other words, the cloud service will manage the infrastructure (servers, storage, and networks), so that developers don't have to worry about that stuff. (They do have to make their applications "cloud aware," so that they can monitor themselves and obtain more resources as needed.) This should improve elasticity — that is, the ability to quickly scale up and down as needs change. In JPMorgan's existing private cloud, "the infrastructure teams work with our developers to identify peak volume through the year," said Larry Feinsmith, the bank's head of global technology strategy, innovation and partnerships. The developers ask for a certain amount of computing and storage resources to meet peak demand. So although virtualized servers save the bank money, it still has to maintain enough servers to handle peak volumes for every application. In the latest generation of private and public cloud computing technology — some of which use OpenStack protocols to control pools of compute, storage, and networking resources managed through a dashboard or API — "you no longer have to deploy for peak," Feinsmith said. "You have to deploy for steady state and then it will scale up or down when you have peaks." Internal resources are shared across the entire organization, regardless of application. Public cloud resources, of course, are virtually inexhaustible. And instead of needing people to watch applications and provide more horsepower or storage when needed, the applications manage their own resources and obtain what they need automatically. The new environment should save time for application developers, Deasy said. "We're spending a lot of time and energy thinking about how to help our application developers be even more efficient," he said. "What does the next-generation application development environment look like? What are the tools? What are the ways they're going to develop?" The bank has 43,000 employees in IT; almost 19,000 are developers. "If we could get back just one hour a day of productivity per developer, you can see how many years of productivity we could gain back," Deasy said. "Which is why we have a big initiative around what we're calling next-generation software modernization." Agile development — the process of developing software in quick iterations rather than bigger, longer-term projects — is also part of the picture. Deasy, a former CIO at General Motors, Tyco and Siemens, wants to make software development run more like a manufacturing plant. "The more you can automate and take friction out of the system from the time you start writing code to the time you're supporting it in production, our developers can spend more time innovating — which is what they prefer to be doing anyway," he said. The use of public cloud computing services will help the bank direct its technology investments more wisely, Deasy maintains. « 1  |  2 »     view entire article Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints JOIN THE DISCUSSION Comment SEE MORE IN Bank Technology RELATED TAGS Comments (0) Be the first to comment on this post using the section below.

Apollo Global Management LLC, Wilton Re Holdings Ltd., Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and JC Flowers & Co. are among potential bidders who have expressed interest, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. Talcott could fetch $3 billion to $4 billion in a sale, they said. Talcott includes so-called runoff coverage, or segments where Hartford is no longer writing new contracts, and had about $4.7 billion of statutory capital at the end of June, according to financial statements. Hartford has been exiting such policies in recent years through a variety of transactions, and Chief Financial Officer Beth Bombara, who previously led Talcott, said Sept. 12 that the insurer sees the possible advantage of a larger deal. “We’re always open to looking at other ways to move the risk to someone else,” Bombara said at a conference hosted by Barclays Plc. “Ideally, we would like to find a solution where we were able to transfer all of the liabilities and the legal entities, not do it via reinsurance. When you do pieces, reinsurance gets a little difficult.” Hartford climbed 1.1 percent to $42.42 at 2:10 p.m. Wednesday, narrowing its loss for the year to 2.4 percent. The Insurance Insider reported earlier on efforts to sell the unit. Michelle Loxton, a spokeswoman for Hartford, which is based in the Connecticut city of the same name, declined to comment. Narrowing Focus Selling Talcott would help Hartford focus on auto insurance, where the company has been caught off guard by higher-than-expected claims costs, Credit Suisse Group AG analysts led by Ryan Tunis said in a note. They said the range of $3 billion to $4 billion could be a “conservative estimate.” Jennifer Hurson, a spokeswoman for JC Flowers, declined to comment, as did a representative for JPMorgan. Charles Zehren, a spokesman for Apollo, didn’t respond to a message. Nor did Wilton Re’s Ray Eckert or Warren Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire. Hartford struck a deal in 2013 to sell a U.K. variable-annuity business to Berkshire, and agreed the next year to sell a Japanese operation to Orix Corp.

David Lim mulled the idea for seven years before he finally left the bank’s South Korea unit in February, heading back to school to start a new career as a physical therapist. For the 43-year-old father of one, the country’s shrinking financial industry and booming health-care sector made the decision to pursue his passion a little less daunting. “Because Korea is aging fast, people are growing more and more health conscious,” said Lim, who left his role in banking sales at JPMorgan to join the health sciences program at the University of Otago in New Zealand. After graduation, he plans to eventually start his own business in Korea. Lim is among a growing number of bankers turning to stronger segments of Korea’s job market as the nation’s financial industry grapples with weak profitability, tepid economic growth and rising corporate defaults. Financial-sector employment shrank by 3.3 percent in the year through October 2015, versus gains of at least 1.9 percent over similar periods in Hong Kong, New York and the U.K. For a related story on Korea’s business culture, click here. Employment in Korea’s health-care and technology industries, meanwhile, has been rising amid strong demand from a graying society and President Park Geun-hye’s campaign to create new growth engines in Asia’s fourth-largest economy. The shift is also visible in the nation’s $1.3 trillion stock market, with shares of health-care and technology companies leading gains among 11 industry groups this year. “I have a positive view on the IT and health-care sectors in the long-term,” said Lee Kyoung Min, a Seoul-based analyst at Daishin Securities Co. “They are probably two of the few industries that can actually grow in today’s economy.” Korean health-care businesses are booming as the nation ages. The health and social work segment of gross domestic product expanded by 8.1 percent in the second quarter, versus 3.3 percent for the economy as a whole. On the employment side, health-care jobs climbed 1.3 percent in the 12 months through October 2015, according to the latest government data available. The proportion of Koreans aged 65 and above will more than triple by 2060 to 40 percent of the population, according to Statistics Korea. Steady Growth The nation’s changing demographics helped convince Lee Jung Ha, a 49-year-old former head of currency trading at Woori Investment & Securities (now part of NH Investment & Securities Co.), to leave his two-decade career in finance and start a nursing home near Seoul. Lee Jung Ha Source: Lee Jung Ha It’s an industry with “steady growth,” said Lee, who studied for months to pass a nursing-care test and completed a year of field training before opening his facility -- Life Is Beautiful -- in August. “Sometimes I miss the trading room, but I am more excited with this new path.” Eunice Kim, a former trading analyst at ING Bank in Seoul, found her new career in the technology industry. After leaving ING in 2011, Kim worked at her family’s electronics manufacturing business until it was purchased last year. She joined a U.K.-based technology startup in May to run its Korea operations, drawn to the company’s flexible working hours and the potential for a big payday if the firm succeeds. “If things go well, there may be buying interest from U.S. tech companies,” said Kim, 35, who declined to name her current employer because she’s not authorized to speak to media. “This will be a great opportunity for me both financially and professionally.” Korea’s technology industry has been a standout in the nation’s job market, expanding 6.4 percent in the year through October 2015 thanks in part to President Park’s efforts to build a “creative economy” fueled by high-tech entrepreneurs. The government announced plans this month to invest 15.3 trillion won ($13.9 billion) in areas such as software engineering, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and smart cars next year. Men’s Club For shareholders of Korea’s technology and health-care companies, 2016 has been a banner year. Companies in the two sectors have climbed 21 percent and 26 percent, respectively, based on a market-capitalization-weighted average of their returns. That compares with a 4.5 percent increase in the benchmark Kospi index and a 5 percent gain in financial stocks this year through Thursday. The Kospi added 0.2 percent on Friday. Gaining exposure to high-flying industries doesn’t come cheap. Korea’s health-care stocks are valued at an average 102 times reported earnings, while tech shares command a multiple of 61 -- almost six times higher than that of financial companies. Still, there are good reasons for financial firms to trade at a discount. Per-share earnings for companies in the MSCI Korea Financials Index dropped by about 5 percent over the past year as record-low benchmark borrowing costs squeezed banks’ net-interest margins, while the delinquency rate on Korean bank loans rose to the highest in 13 months in July. Bankers who left the business see benefits beyond just being part of a faster-growing industry. Lim was attracted to the long “occupational lifespan” of physical therapists, who can perform the job into their 60s and beyond. Lee, the former Woori trader, achieved a long-time dream of running his own business, while Kim was able to escape what she called a “young men’s club” on the trading floors of big banks. “I have no regrets about leaving,” Kim said. “I enjoy my work and I feel fulfilled every day.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

USA TODAY John Stumpf, chairman and CEO of the Wells Fargo & Company, testifies before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee September 20, 2016 in Washington, DC. (Photo: Win McNamee, Getty Images) CEOs aren't alone bringing home giant paychecks from the nation's big banks. Less-recognized executives at these banks are also making major bank, outstripping the pay of CEOs of even some rival financial institutions. Half of the 10 best-paid executives at the nation's banks in the Standard & Poor's 500 aren't the chief executive officers of their companies. They include JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Chief Operating Officer Matthew Zames, Bank of America (BAC) COO Thomas Montag and Mary Callahan Erdoes, who is the chief of the asset management unit of JPMorgan Chase, according to a USA TODAY analysis of 2015 compensation data from the banks' most recent filings. Bank of America's Montag out-earned his own bank's CEO (Brian Moynihan) and that of Citigroup (C) as well (Michael Corbat). USA TODAY Ask Matt: How to check if Wells Fargo tricked you All told, 17 named non-CEO executives at the 17 banks in the S&P 500 raked in more than the median $8 million that CEOs at those same banks got. Named executives include heads of major bank divisions, chief operating officers and chief financial officers. "One thing this tells us is that bank pay is not measured against the right performance metrics," says Eleanor Bloxham, chief executive officer of The Value Alliance, a firm that specializes in corporate finance. These large paychecks to named officers are paid without them incurring the same responsibility as CEOs, and that provides the incentive to take on additional risk, she says. Understanding that fat paychecks at banks go beyond just the CEOs became more important this week as Congress looked into the incentives of executives at Wells Fargo (WFC), which is accused of secretly opening millions of accounts for customers. Carrie Tolstedt, head of Wells Fargo's community banking unit at the center of the alleged fraud, was paid $9.1 million last year, which is more than the pay of eight of the 17 CEOs at S&P 500 banks. She also owns Wells Fargo shares valued at $43 million, says S&P Global Market Intelligence. USA TODAY These are the banks you gripe about the most The financial sector has a history of paying large compensation packages to top executives well beyond just the CEO. Three of the companies with the highest average pay for named executive officers between 2012 and 2014 were Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), according to an analysis by pay-tracking firm Equilar. That's not to say that bank CEOs aren't paid well themselves. Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf and JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon were the best-paid bankers last year, hauling in $19.3 million and $18.2 million, respectively. That's well above the median $10.8 million paid to S&P 500 CEOs last year. But adding in the next five best-paid named bank executives, none of whom are CEOs, add up to a total haul of $120 million. Looks like you don't have to be CEO to make bank. 122 CONNECTTWEET 77 LINKEDIN 14 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2cYjwYC

Embed from Getty Images   Bloomberg News reports that after all, restructuring advice isn’t what the bank is known for in Brazil. Leoni and Pombo are trying to change that. As demand for traditional banking services suffers through a nationwide credit squeeze and the worst recession in a century, global banks such as JPMorgan and Credit Suisse are trying to elbow in on the top players in the restructuring business, including Moelis, PJT Partners, Rothschild and Lazard. “As the top bond underwriter in Latin America, we saw our business really shrink on the flow side in 2015, so it was a strategy for us to look for new opportunities," Leoni, head of debt capital markets for JPMorgan in Brazil, said in an phone interview this month.

Or the frozen yogurt store that sits lonely in February? Or the little café that seems empty most of the time?  C’mon, you probably think to yourself: How do these places stay in business? How many dresses/vanilla cones/cups of coffee do they have to sell just to make the rent, let alone cover overhead and…oh…turn a profit? Well, wonder no more. Your question has been answered.  And unfortunately the answer isn’t good. Those small businesses are barely staying in business.  That fact was confirmed in a new study by the JPMorgan Chase Institute, according to this report from Bloomberg. “Most small businesses are operating on very small margins,” Diana Farrell, chief executive of the JPMorgan Chase Institute, told Bloomberg. The study analyzed 470 million transactions by 570,000 small businesses last year and here’s the result: The average small business has about 27 days of cash reserves on hand. Restaurants are in the worst shape, with only 16 days of cash. Firms in the real estate sector fared better with 47 days of cash. Many financial experts I speak to say a company should have at least six months of cash in reserve in case things turn south, which means that the study’s numbers aren’t good. More disturbingly, the bank found that cash inflows for the typical small business exceeded its outflows by an average $7 per day. No, that is not a typo. Before anyone panics, outflows do include any transfers made to the owners for savings or (more likely) spending. Regardless, not a lot is left over in the business to cover anything unexpected. Is it the economy? The political environment? Too much taxation? Over-regulation?  Lots of groups and pundits point fingers. Or it could be that many of us just aren’t great business people. In the end, and speaking as a business owner, it comes down to the individual entrepreneur’s ability to turn a cash profit…and not just $7 a day.

USA TODAY John Stumpf, chairman and CEO of the Wells Fargo & Company, testifies before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee September 20, 2016 in Washington, DC. (Photo: Win McNamee, Getty Images) CEOs aren't alone bringing home giant paychecks from the nation's big banks. Less-recognized executives at these banks are also making major bank, outstripping the pay of CEOs of even some rival financial institutions. Half of the 10 best-paid executives at the nation's banks in the Standard & Poor's 500 aren't the chief executive officers of their companies. They include JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Chief Operating Officer Matthew Zames, Bank of America (BAC) COO Thomas Montag and Mary Callahan Erdoes, who is the chief of the asset management unit of JPMorgan Chase, according to a USA TODAY analysis of 2015 compensation data from the banks' most recent filings. Bank of America's Montag out-earned his own bank's CEO (Brian Moynihan) and that of Citigroup (C) as well (Michael Corbat). USA TODAY Ask Matt: How to check if Wells Fargo tricked you All told, 17 named non-CEO executives at the 17 banks in the S&P 500 raked in more than the median $8 million that CEOs at those same banks got. Named executives include heads of major bank divisions, chief operating officers and chief financial officers. "One thing this tells us is that bank pay is not measured against the right performance metrics," says Eleanor Bloxham, chief executive officer of The Value Alliance, a firm that specializes in corporate finance. These large paychecks to named officers are paid without them incurring the same responsibility as CEOs, and that provides the incentive to take on additional risk, she says. Understanding that fat paychecks at banks go beyond just the CEOs became more important this week as Congress looked into the incentives of executives at Wells Fargo (WFC), which is accused of secretly opening millions of accounts for customers. Carrie Tolstedt, head of Wells Fargo's community banking unit at the center of the alleged fraud, was paid $9.1 million last year, which is more than the pay of eight of the 17 CEOs at S&P 500 banks. She also owns Wells Fargo shares valued at $43 million, says S&P Global Market Intelligence. USA TODAY These are the banks you gripe about the most The financial sector has a history of paying large compensation packages to top executives well beyond just the CEO. Three of the companies with the highest average pay for named executive officers between 2012 and 2014 were Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), according to an analysis by pay-tracking firm Equilar. That's not to say that bank CEOs aren't paid well themselves. Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf and JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon were the best-paid bankers last year, hauling in $19.3 million and $18.2 million, respectively. That's well above the median $10.8 million paid to S&P 500 CEOs last year. But adding in the next five best-paid named bank executives, none of whom are CEOs, add up to a total haul of $120 million. Looks like you don't have to be CEO to make bank. 122 CONNECTTWEET 77 LINKEDIN 14 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2cYjwYC

Climate Week NYC, an annual environmental side-event coinciding with the start of the United Nations General Assembly, is winding down. For several days, venues across Manhattan hosted summits, panels and forums to build up momentum for the annual Conference of the Parties (COP) climate talks, which this year will be held in Marrakesh, Morocco. Climate Week also brings together some of the world’s largest corporations, many of which sponsor the event to showcase their progress on mitigating climate risks. But Rainforest Action Network (RAN) insists the large multinational banks that sponsored Climate Week are not exactly putting their money where their mouthes are. Instead, RAN claims these banks are plunking their money into fossil fuel projects around the world, which in turn negates any the progress they’re making on climate change. A 2016 report, published by RAN along with partners, reveals the scale of the financial sector’s investments in petroleum, natural gas and coal. From 2013 to 2015, 25 of the world’s largest banks financed almost $800 billion in fossil fuel investments. These banks include Climate Week platinum sponsor Bank of America, affiliate sponsor JPMorgan Chase and supporting sponsor BNP Paribas (which owns Bank of the West). Juxtaposed against other sponsors, which include SolarCity, the climate advisory EcoAct and the Sustainable Coffee Challenge, the banks’ participation in Climate Week comes across as odd considering their far-reaching investments in the fossil fuels sector. Climate Week’s banking sponsors are only a few of the world’s largest banks RAN and its partners evaluated in the study. Researchers analyzed the largest banks in the U.S., Canada and Europe, and graded them based on the level of financing within the coal, liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, and extreme oil (as in: tar sands or extreme offshore oil) sectors. RAN, along with BankTrack, Sierra Club and Oil Change International, also evaluated the companies’ disclosures related to human rights. Grades of a C or lower are the norm in the industry, according to the findings. A B- is rare, and it’s worth noting that Bank of America and JPMorgan both received this score. BNP Paribas scored a C+. The RAN report has its claws out for just about every multinational bank, including Deutsche Bank, the financier behind Blackhawk Mining. The Kentucky-based company became a coal powerhouse this decade by purchasing the assets from struggling coal producers such Arch Coal and Patriot Coal. As a result of $1.3 billion in loans from Deutsche Bank, the company continued mountaintop removal (MTR) mining across Appalachia. RAN says such practices contributed to the destruction of mountains throughout the region, as well as to health problems such as birth defects, cancer and heart disease. Deutsche Bank announced earlier this year that it would no longer underwrite loans for MTR mining projects, but RAN insists plenty of damage has already been done. But it is platinum sponsor Bank of America that is often called out for what RAN infers as hypocrisy for supporting Climate Week on the one hand yet financing fossil fuel projects with the other. RAN estimates the bank invested as much as $69 billion in oil, gas and coal projects this decade. And the group has a point, especially considering that the company says it has financed $53 billion in “low carbon activities” since 2007. And this about more than these banks’ contribution to climate change and environmental degradation. As other advocacy groups point out, including the activist investor NGO Ceres, banks’ continued investments in fossil fuels exposes investors to a bevy of risks. And those risks include: stranded assets that stay in the ground as more private companies and governments invest in clean energy technologies; exposure to human rights abuses that can result in backlash against a company operating overseas; and the prospect that conventional energy prices will stay low for a long time. That turns investments in expensive projects such as tar sands and offshore oil extraction into huge liabilities on a company’s balance sheet, whether it’s a financial institution or not.

Posted 2 months ago. Connie Evans, Americas Wire Writers Group Leave a comment 26 reads TV Producer Nely Galán and Super Model Beverly Johnson promote minority small businesses. / Photo Credit: Ashleigh A.M. Bing After Noemi Prado devoted 29 years to working for Southwest Moulding in Grand Prairie, TX, the owners decided to close the business. But Ms. Prado gathered her retirement savings and other financing to purchase the company, a transaction that has sustained and created jobs for 40 people in her community. A key aspect of the financing was a $825,000 loan that she received from theValley Economic Development Corporation’s (VEDC), a non-profit organization that provides affordable business assistance services, direct financial assistance, and entrepreneurial training to minority businesses and entrepreneurs.  “If it wasn’t for VEDC, it wouldn’t have happened,” Ms. Prado said, noting that it was difficult to obtain traditional bank financing. Data collected by the Association for Enterprise Opportunity (AEO) shows that a large percentage of people want to be like Ms. Prado and run their own businesses.  At the same time, however, many would-be entrepreneurs lack the access to mentors, capital and support networks that could help them get up and running. That’s the problem our nation faces. Small businesses are actually creating a higher percentage of new jobs than big companies, but entrepreneurs and small business owners struggle to get the access to capital and the knowledge, known as ‘trusted guidance’ in the microbusiness industry, that they need to start or sustain their businesses. The reality is that significant barriers limit opportunities for business owners of color.  They face discrimination in the banking world, have fewer wealth assets, and often lack the technical skills to make their dreams and aspirations come true. Yet, there have been new developments that are slowly changing the landscape for minority entrepreneurs and small business owners. Perhaps the most powerful is the changing demographics of the country, which corporate and government leaders are starting to better understand.  The nation is moving towards a majority-minority status. Already, the majority of children born in the country are children of color.  Thus, it’s clear that the nation must become more inclusive with business opportunities or the pockets of poverty across the country will just grow larger.  And, smart corporate leaders recognize that the growing communities of color are where future growth and expansions of their businesses should concentrate for sustained growth. Certainly, part of the answer lies with Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), which are getting more attention than ever before from both the public and private sectors. These mission-based organizations, which receive federal resources to invest in disadvantaged communities, are frequently where minority business owners turn when they need financing.  But needless to say, the demand frequently outpaces their money supply. One of the positives is the collaborations now taking place between major banking institutions and CDFIs and other organizations, such as VEDC. For instance, this year JPMorgan Chase & Co. announced a Small Business Forward initiative, which will allocate $30 million over five years towards growing local, community-based small businesses. The program includes a combination of targeted lending to minority-owned businesses, innovative community development financing and technical assistance for entrepreneurs.  Through this work, JPMorgan Chase is helping minority- and community-based small business owners become engines of job growth and economic vitality in the neighborhoods they serve. At a recent event in Washington, DC that AEO co-sponsored with JP Morgan Chase, Janis Bowdler, their Head of Community Development for Global Philanthropy, put the institution’s thinking in perspective. “As the economy recovers, much of the growth is often channeled toward reviving commercial corridors and downtowns in U.S. cities,” she said. “As a result, many disadvantaged neighborhoods, where underserved people live, are being left behind.” Working with JPMorgan Chase, VEDC has created a National African American Small Business Loan Fund that will boost economic opportunity for minority-owned businesses and help them serve low-wealth communities by providing them with greater access to capital, technical assistance and financial consulting.  VEDC is a member AEO, which is a trade association for the microbusiness industry. A broad range of organizations are recognizing the power of “inclusive entrepreneurship,” which will help bring equity to communities and Main Streets across the nation.  The National Coalition of 100 Black Women and New Economics for Women partnered with AEO and JPMorgan Chase to celebrate minority business owners at the event in Washington, DC during the annual meetings of the Black and Hispanic Caucus Conventions.  Speakers specifically noted that minority women often need assistance in starting and running businesses, but frequently are unaware of how to get that help. Clearly, various partnerships and collaborations can help minorities overcome the barriers. Empowered mission-based community lenders are working with underserved entrepreneurs to help them build and sustain businesses that can fuel financial and social mobility, and create jobs that are boosting the economy — locally and nationally. We must make supporting entrepreneurs and small businesses a national priority. Ms. Evans is president and CEO of Association for Enterprise Opportunity (AEO), the voice of microbusiness in the United States. Also On Atlanta Daily World: comments – Add Yours DIGITAL EDITION!

JPMorgan Buys Stake in InvestCloud to Speed Digital Revamp By Tanaya Macheel September 21, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Related How Banks Are Co-Opting the Robo-Advisory Revolution Big Firms Pour Millions into Wealth Management Tech Firm Krawcheck Launches Women's Digital Investment Adviser These Banks Are Funding Fintech JPMorgan Chase has made an equity investment of an undisclosed size in InvestCloud, a startup that provides cloud-based software to the securities industry. The partnership will allow the bank to accelerate the development of digital capabilities for individual investors at the JPMorgan and Chase franchises and expedite the introduction of online investing capabilities, it said in a Tuesday news release. The announcement comes as JPMorgan has been investing heavily in a digital overhaul. This year it has launched a redesign of its website, opened new digital headquarters in New York City with a Silicon Valley feel and started a fintech accelerator in which it invites startups to become "residents," with access to the bank's facilities, systems and expertise. "Across the wealth spectrum, our clients are increasingly engaging with us digitally," Mary Callahan Erdoes, CEO of asset management for JPMorgan Chase, said in the release. "We have been managing wealth for more than 200 years. Pairing these new technological capabilities with our trusted guidance will help our clients achieve their long-term financial goals with flexibility in how they interact with us and our advisors." InvestCloud, based in Los Angeles, will bring "easy-to-use dashboards, additional mobile functionalities, and seamless account opening" to JPMorgan's wealth management clients while the bank introduces digital features to enhance interactions with advisers and further personalize the integration of its market insights, beginning in 2017. JPMorgan follows UBS, which made a similar move in May when it took an equity stake in SigFig, as part of a partnership wherein SigFig develops technology and investment tools for the Swiss bank. Also this year, Royal Bank of Canada partnered with FutureAdvisor to integrate digital advice into its wealth management offerings. Wells Fargo has said it will pilot a digital advice platform early next year.

Here's A Way To Think About It (Seeking Alpha) Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC)'s largest shareholder, Warren Buffett, won't be commenting on the financial institution's growing scandal. Buffett, speaking to Fox Business, said he will wait until November to speak about the bank's scandal. The Oracle of Omaha owns nearly 10 percent of the bank, but there may be some cause for concern following the scandal given Buffett's philosophy of investing in quality leaders. Fox Business recalled the Salomon Brothers bond scandal, which occurred 25 years ago this month in which traders submitted false Treasury bond bids to avoid trading rules. Related Link: Elizabeth Warren Just Blasted Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf's 'Gutless' Leadership Buffett said during a Congressional sub-committee at that time that he would be "understanding" if a company loses money through legitimate business practices. However, he will be "ruthless" if a company "loses a shred of reputation" at his expense. Investors could be quick to point out that Wells Fargo has already lost more than just a "shred" of reputation given the stock's nearly $25 billion in market cap which was wiped out once the scandal came into light. The "shred" of reputation could also worsen as the House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling told Fox Business he plans on issuing a subpoena to Wells Fargo's top executives, including its Community Banking Chief Carrie Tolstedt who left the company in July with a $125 million pay package. However, Fox Business suggested Buffett could be forced to comment if more damaging revelations appear since he is after all the largest shareholder.

Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton chimed in and said she was "deeply disturbed" by Wells Fargo illegal practices in an open letter to its customers on her website. "Gutless leadership" is how Sen. Elizabeth Warren described Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf's actions in front the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday. Since the scandal broke earlier in the month, Wells Fargo stock is down nearly 8 percent. Related Link: Buffett Buttons His Lips, Won't Speak On Election Or Wells Fargo Until November JPMorgan downgraded Wells Fargo to Neutral following the tough senate hearings "and mounting public scrutiny following the opening of fraudulent accounts." "We expect these will result in additional investigations which would likely pressure expenses and revenues and continued media scrutiny with an election year," the bank said. Morgan Stanley had a different take and feels that Wells Fargo's stock is now inexpensive, subsequently raising its rating to Overweight with an attached $53 dollar price target. "Wells is rarely this inexpensive. This is an opportunity," Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. Some have felt that the relatively low fine for the bank, which has $1.8 trillion in assets, is just a blip on the radar. However, since the banking crisis in 2008, its common knowledge how difficult it is to improve public opinion about a bank when it has soured. At time of publication, Wells Fargo was seen trading at $45.73, down 1.78 percent on Wednesday. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

"Following" : "Follow"}} September 21, 2016 12:28pm   Comments Share: Related FLT Mid-Afternoon Market Update: Tandem Diabetes Drops Following Weak Q3 Results; Novocure Shares Spike Higher Mid-Day Market Update: Crude Oil Down Over 3%; Office Depot Shares Gain On Upbeat Earnings Barclays’ Darrin D. Peller believes FleetCor Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: FLT) is well positioned entering 2017, with upside potential driven by the STP acquisition, Comdata, Speedway, international expansion, incremental partnerships and improved comps on FX, gas and other macro drivers. Peller maintained an Overweight rating on the company, while raising the price target from $180 to $190. Upside Drivers The analyst mentioned that STP now offers toll tags across about 250 parking garages, while it's also testing tags to buy fuel at Shell stations across Brazil. “Coupled with the government doubling the number of private roads in Brazil over the next five years and potential pricing opportunities, we expect STP will maintain its 1H double-digit top-line run rate for the FY and grow in the teens for the foreseeable future,” Peller stated. Conservative Outlook The analyst believes the FleetCor Technologies’ accretion guidance continues to be conservative and the 2017 earnings could drive upside. “Speedway represents the fifth largest portfolio in the US and will represent the third largest in FLT's portfolio,” the analyst noted, while pointing out that “Comdata is expected to grow at a 10 percent rate over the medium term as FLT has found more opportunities to go down market where there is a superior margin profile relative to up market accounts.” In addition, demand for corporate payments continues to be robust and is expected to continue to grow in the high teens through 2017. The EPS estimate for 2017 has been raised from $7.72 to $8.20. Do you have ideas for articles/interviews you'd like to see more of on Benzinga?

neutral from overweight, citing the risks of more litigation costs and higher regulation after the Senate hearings with bank CEO John Stumpf. "We are downgrading Wells Fargo ... following tough Senate hearings and mounting public scrutiny following the opening of fraudulent accounts," analyst Vivek Juneja wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. "We expect these will result in additional investigations which would likely pressure expenses and revenues and continued media scrutiny with an election year — there is significant uncertainty about how much some issues will cost and how long they will take."

The firm cut its rating on WFC to Neutral and lowered its price target from $53.50 to $48.00, citing “tough Senate hearings and mounting public scrutiny following the opening of fraudulent accounts.” The analyst also notes that yesterday’s “senate hearings are likely to expand probes” against the company. Related: See what ETFs own the most WFC From the report: In our view: 1) Wells will need to spend a lot more on litigation, examining past violations in additional areas, and responding to requirements from more hearings, investigations and lawsuits; 2) revenues will likely face some slowdown in growth including potentially impact on cross-sell in Retail brokerage, a key focus in that area; 3) this is a material reputational hit given the large number of unauthorized accounts (2 million) and how long it went on; and 4) this will likely result in a shift to greater earnings growth from areas such as investment banking which carry lower multiple. Impact on earnings is hard to determine because of uncertainty about likely total expenses – no comparable lawsuit as this matter is very different from the mortgage crisis. The stock has fallen recently but the uncertain timeframe and earnings impact is likely to keep the stock under pressure. $1-2 bil increase in costs would lower EPS by $0.20-0.40 and imply 11.7x-12.3 P/E multiple respectively (if not tax deductible), which is within the range of regional banks – unclear if these penalties would be tax deductible. What is particularly disappointing to us is that we and investors have long held Wells Fargo management in very high regard – they have been smart contrarian thinkers and made thoughtful decisions. We expect management to turn this around but it will likely take some time and expense – hence the downgrade. WFC is in hot water with its customers, clients, regulators, and the general public over an account-opening scandal where it defrauded millions of customers over a period of several years. Agents of the company opened customer accounts without their consent in order to rack up fees and meet sales goals, according to reports. The company has admitted wrongdoing and fired over 5,000 employees who engaged in the practice, but the issue is far from being put to bed: It is unclear whether this will lead to criminal prosecutions and lawsuits will expand – State Attorneys General, SEC, and potentially criminal investigations. Wells Fargo has been viewed as a core long term holding for many investors – uncertainty around these issues could drive more investors to exit. There is significant uncertainty about some issues – 1) how to compensate customers whose credit scores were increased; 2) how to compensate employees who were fired for not meeting sales targets; and 3) how far back in time Wells will need to go to scrutinize sales. We expect the scrutiny is likely to require lot of investigations and increased compliance and training spending, pressuring expenses. CEO John Stumpf was grilled by regulators yesterday, but thus far is refusing to step down from his post amid the scandal. Wells Fargo shares fell $0.13 (-0.28%) to $46.43 in premarket trading Wednesday. Year-to-date, WFC has fallen 14.35%.

September 21, 2016 - ArcelorMittal (the "Company" or "ArcelorMittal") announces the early tender results of its tender offers (the "Offers") to purchase for cash, for a combined aggregate purchase price (exclusive of Accrued Interest (as defined herein)) of up to $1,500,000,000 (the "Initial Maximum Tender Cap"), its outstanding 6.125% notes due 2018 (CUSIP 03938LAF1/ISIN US03938LAF13; CUSIP 03938LAD6/ISIN US03938LAD64; CUSIP L0302DAN3/ISIN USL0302DAN32) (the "2018 Notes"), 9.850% notes due 2019 (CUSIP 03938LAM6/ISIN US03938LAM63) (the "2019 Notes"), 5.125% notes due June 2020 (CUSIP 03938LAY0/ISIN US03938LAY02) (the "June 2020 Notes"), 5.250% notes due August 2020 (CUSIP 03938LAQ7/ISIN US03938LAQ77) (the "August 2020 Notes" and together with the June 2020 Notes, the "2020 Notes"), 5.500% notes due 2021 (CUSIP 03938LAU8/ISIN US03938LAU89) (the "2021 Notes") and 6.250% notes due 2022 (CUSIP 03938LAX2/ISIN US03938LAX29) (the "2022 Notes" and, together with the 2018 Notes, the 2019 Notes, the 2020 Notes and the 2021 Notes, the "Notes"). The Company has decided to increase the Initial Maximum Tender Cap to $1,528,105,440 (such amended amount, the "Revised Maximum Tender Cap") so as to avoid proration of any series of validly tendered Notes with Acceptance Priority Levels 1 to 5 (as described below). This announcement does not contain the full terms and conditions of the Offers, which are contained in the offer to purchase dated September 7, 2016 (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Offer to Purchase"), and is subject to the offer restrictions set out below and more fully described in the Offer to Purchase. The table above sets forth information with respect to the Notes that were validly tendered at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on September 20, 2016 (the "Early Tender Time") and not withdrawn. Because the Offers were oversubscribed (based on the Revised Maximum Tender Cap) as of the Early Tender Time, the Company has accepted for purchase on the Early Settlement Date Notes tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Time based on the Acceptance Priority Levels as provided in the Offer to Purchase. The Company has accepted for purchase all Notes that were tendered on or before the Early Tender Time with Acceptance Priority Levels 1 to 5 and none of the tendered Notes with Acceptance Priority Level 6. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, with respect to all such Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Time and not validly withdrawn and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offers, the Company expects to pay the Total Consideration, together with any accrued and unpaid interest from, and including, the immediately preceding interest payment date applicable to such Notes to, but excluding, the Early Settlement Date (the "Accrued Interest"), to the Holders on the third Business Day after the Early Tender Time, being September 23, 2016 (such date, the "Early Settlement Date"). The "Total Consideration" is the U.S. dollar amount payable per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes set forth in the table above and includes an early tender premium of $50 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (the "Early Tender Premium"). Since the Offers were fully subscribed as of the Early Tender Time, holders who validly tender Notes following the Early Tender Time will not have any of their Notes accepted for purchase. The Offers will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on October 4, 2016, unless extended (as may be extended, the "Expiration Time"). The "Withdrawal Deadline" with respect to the Offers was 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on September 20, 2016. Notes already tendered pursuant to the Offers may no longer be withdrawn, and any Notes tendered after the Withdrawal Deadline and at or prior to the Expiration Time may not be withdrawn.

Titan to launch new collections Telenor, Tikona to merge? Edelweiss acquires Ambit’s hedge fund TNN | Sep 23, 2016, 04.00 AM IST Mumbai: Domestic financial house Edelweiss group on Thursday said that it will take over Ambit Alpha Fund, a domestic hedge fund that managed about Rs 1,100 crore worth of equity assets, from homegrown investment banking outfit Ambit for an undisclosed amount. The Alpha Fund is a category III alternate investment fund under Sebi's nomenclature. The average buyout rates in the funds management space is between 6% and 7.5% of the assets under management but Edelweiss paid much less than the industry average for this acquisition, sources said. The current acquisition is Edelweiss's second buyout this year in the fund management space. In March this year, Edelweiss had agreed to buy global financial major J P Morgan's domestic mutual fund business which managed assets worth about Rs 7,000 crore of which about Rs 3,200 crore was in equites. Currently under its global assets management business, Edelwiess manages about Rs 35,000 crore, within which the the multi strategy funds division or the alternate investment arm manages about Rs 15,000 crore. In the last two years, the assets in this arm have grown about 10 times, making it one of the best in the industry, Venkat Ramaswamy, ED & co-head, Edelweiss Global Asset Management said. Ambit's "Alpha Fund is complementary to our bouquet of offerings in the alternative investment fund business," Ramaswamy said. The financial house will acquire only the fund from Ambit. The current fund managers of the fund are moving to Avendus Capital where they will set up a hedge fund.

The definitive ranking of Wall Street investment banks in every business line Portia Crowe Sep. 22, 2016, 7:01 PM 12,844 facebook linkedin twitter email print Buda Mendes/Getty Images We have new data on how Wall Street banks stack up in every business line, and there is one clear winner. JPMorgan led the pack in the first half of 2016 for revenue across fixed income, equities, and banking, according to data-analytics company Coalition. That bank made $12.5 billion. It ranked No. 1 by revenues in investment banking, and within that equity-capital markets. It also placed first in fixed income, currencies, and commodities (FICC), and within that G10 rates, and securitization. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup ranked joint second overall for the period. Goldman placed first in commodities within the FICC division. It also ranked first in futures and options within equities, and in mergers and acquisitions within investment banking. Citigroup's move up the rankings — it finished 2015 in joint third — was based off of a strong performance in FICC. It ranked second overall in that business behind JPMorgan, and within FICC placed first for emerging markets and municipal finance, and joint first for G10 FX. Here's the global ranking, plus the rankings broken down by region: View As: One Page Slides JPMorgan is a clear winner, with a top three position in every business except cash equities. Coalition JPMorgan also ranks top in two of the three regions, placing first in the Americas and Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Deutsche Bank and Citigroup ranked joint first in Asia.

Published on September 22, 2016. Reprints Reprints Dentsu's world headquarters tower in Tokyo. Credit: Kure via Wikimedia Commons Most Popular When Dentsu Inc. proactively informed longtime client Toyota of "irregularities" related to some digital media business transactions this week, the Association of National Advertisers applauded. "My first thought was kudos to Dentsu for taking the step and being proactive in alerting their client to this issue versus what could happened the other way around with finding out from an audit," said Bill Duggan, group executive-VP at the ANA. He added that he was not surprised about the irregularities being in the digital sphere since the space is "murky and complicated and has a supply chain with many people who touch the clients business." Digital lends itself well to "non-transparent activities," said Mr. Duggan. Andrew Swinand, who launched a media consultancy called Transparent Media Partners in February, said the Dentsu-Toyota announcement "is going to be the first of many." Related Stories Dentsu Notifies Client Toyota of 'Irregularities' Around Media Transactions in Japan 4A's Won't Participate in 'Trust Panel' With ANA at Advertising Week 4A's Gives Thumbs Down to ANA Transparency Guidelines Ebiquity and K2 Capitalize on ANA Investigation With New Media Transparency Services ANA Issues Long-Awaited Agency-Client Transparency Guidelines Indeed, according to a Wall Street Journal report, two prominent ANA members, J.P. Morgan Chase and General Electric, were conducting audits of their media agencies following findings of the rebate inquiry by Ebquity and K2. The story also reported that a host of powerful members -- AT&T, Allstate, Walgreens, Heineken, Fidelity and US Cellular – were also "trying to get more liberal auditing rights such as the right to audit individual divisions of the holding company or tougher language in new contracts with their agencies." Mr. Duggan declined to elaborate on the marketer audits, other than to say those named by the Journal -- some of which are ANA members -- likely saw the K2 report and took "appropriate steps." He also noted that in the case of J.P. Morgan Chase, financial services "is an area of extremely high scrutiny and accountability." The ANA recently released transparency guidelines that called for marketers to diminish "non-disclosed agency activities." The association hired Ebiquity as well as investigative firm K2 Intelligence in October to investigate allegations that agencies were collecting rebates from U.S. media-buying deals. Mr. Duggan said he believes the K2 report has "helped raise visibility of this issue." The 4A's rejected the ANA's transparency guidelines from Ebiquity this summer, and as of this week, the advertising-agency trade group informed members that it's own Transparency Guiding Principles of Conduct are now a practice standard for membership rather than a recommendation. 4A's representatives declined to comment on the latest Dentsu news. Australia's AdNews first reported that a performance marketing unit of Dentsu in Japan had overbilled Toyota for work for "at least five years." The Financial Times said Dentsu held emergency talks with more than 100 clients to try to contain the damage; it also reported that clients had raised questions about 160 possible instances of overcharging. "This is an issue confined to Dentsu in Japan," Dentsu Inc. said in the statement. "We are taking this matter extremely seriously and investigating the issue to fully understand the facts. All clients who may have been impacted have been communicated with already." "Clients and agencies need to do some work in terms of working out media transparency and clearer standards and protocols," Mr. Swinand said, adding that the industry has to figure out how to "unwind this and save relationships."

Women in Banking: Wellsgate, B of A Settlement and a Fintech Escape By Tanaya Macheel September 22, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Related Q&A with Sallie Krawcheck The Circuit: The 'Daughters of Banking' Community Banker of the Year: Heritage Oaks' Simone Lagomarsino What Bankers Want (and Don't Want) from President Trump 'That's Just Really, Really Bad': Bank CEOs React to Wells Scandal Why Media Representation Matters for Women in Banking Double, Double, Tolstedt and Trouble: Pretty much everyone wants to know why Wells Fargo isn't holding CEO John Stumpf and former consumer banking head Carrie Tolstedt more accountable for 2 million phony accounts created without customers' permission. Last week five Senate Democrats, including Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, pointed out in a letter to Stumpf that Tolstedt received more than $20 million worth of bonuses between 2010 and 2015, “justified by the company in certain instances because of the 'strong cross-sell ratios' in her division,” no doubt bolstered by the phony accounts. Stumpf was hammered by lawmakers for three hours Tuesday, with Warren among the most aggressive. Besides calling for his resignation, she asked why he didn't fire Tolstedt before she retired, despite the fact that Wells was aware of the pending settlement over the phony accounts. Stumpf replied that he was looking at her "full body of work,” while also hinting for the first time that Tolstedt may have been forced out. Though he said Tolstedt "chose to retire" after 27 years, he also said Wells' chief operating officer, Tim Sloan, had told her that the bank "wanted to go in a different direction.” A lawsuit was filed Wednesday against Tolstedt and the Wells board, claiming its refusal to claw back any of Tolstedt's bonuses is “a breach of their fiduciary duties to shareholders.” Hillary Clinton also criticized Tolstedt's reported $125 million payout in an open letter to Wells Fargo customers, in which she also called for "real consequences" for Wells executives (though she did not name Stumpf). "It's hard to imagine that top executives were unaware of a problem that involved thousands of the firm's employees," she said. "After all, they imposed sales targets and compensation incentives in ways that led to this behavior.” She also vowed to protect the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from Republican attempts to undermine it. B of A Bargains: Bank of America has settled its "bros club" lawsuit with Megan Messina, the former managing director who sued in May claiming the bank paid her and other women substantially less than male coworkers and that it tried to push her out when she raised allegations of improper behavior that harmed clients. According to her complaint, she was paid about a third of what her co-head made for 2015, and a female trader who reported to him made less than male colleagues because she took maternity leave. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed in a filing in Manhattan federal court. However, Citigroup paid $33 million to resolve a bias suit by female brokers in 2008; and Morgan Stanley set up a $46 million claims pool to settle a similar claim by former financial advisers in 2007. B of A offered Messina a $500,000 severance to drop claims earlier; the judge overseeing the case agreed to remove that detail from the public record last month, as you may recall from reading here. Digital Drive: Digital has been seen as the death knell of branches, but JPMorgan Chase's branches have been crucial in building long-term relationships with more lucrative customers, even in today's high-tech world, says Erin Hill, the company's head of consumer branch banking and wealth management. "If we were trying to shift to an all-digital channel, I don't think we'd have nearly the success we've had," Hill says, adding that the bank “cannot be naive to the fact that our customers want to be able to engage with us when and where they want in a very easy manner.” JPMorgan has been investing heavily in a digital this year, launching a full redesign of its website, a fintech accelerator, a new digital headquarters and, this week, investing in InvestCloud, a startup that provides cloud-based software to the securities industry. "Across the wealth spectrum, our clients are increasingly engaging with us digitally," says Mary Callahan Erdoes, CEO of asset management. "Pairing these new technological capabilities with our trusted guidance will help our clients achieve their long-term financial goals with flexibility in how they interact with us and our advisers." The Escape Clause: Politico has attempted to paint a picture of fintech as “a woman's world,” where female bankers who “want to escape the alpha male-driven culture of traditional finance” can find another path and where they no longer “have to just grin and bear” the gender bias working against them. (Nevermind that they might have their own interest and instinct for it, on top of their creativity and capability.) “Given all the obstacles in traditional finance, it seems only a matter of time before many of its women workers who want to escape to greener pastures will end up in the fintech industry,” it says. But one important point is buried at the end: “Before women can escape from such an environment, female-led startups must get funding, which still remains a significant barrier for women who want to set up a fintech company.” Male founders are 86% more likely to attract venture capital than female founders. “It's a real problem,” said Ghela Boskivich, one of the organizers behind the FemTech Leaders network. “They often have to bring a man in, in order to get some funding.” (Not surprisingly, female partners are more likely to invest in companies with female executives and three times more likely to invest in one with a female CEO.) Honesty Is the Best Policy: In one of the many op-eds reacting to the Wells scandal, Rachel Morrissey, producer of Breaking Banks, made a plea for financial institutions to incentivize honesty, service and stewardship. “Regulations and laws don't exist so that we can fine and incarcerate people. They exist to give us a framework of acceptable behavior,” she wrote on LinkedIn. She worries about fines — even ones as high as Wells' $190 million — being seen by banks as invitation to behave badly just because they can afford to.  Role Call Wells Fargo's group risk officer for the community banking division, Claudia Russ Anderson, has begun a six-month unpaid leave of absence. Her replacement, Vic Albrecht, will report jointly to Mary Mack, Carrie Tolstedt's successor, and Mike Loughlin, the bank's chief risk officer.  Jennifer Davis, the deputy chief financial officer of Santander Consumer Holdings USA, will resign at the end of the year. She served as interim CFO following a leadership shake-up in July 2015 and moved to the role of deputy CFO in December.  MUFG Union Bank in San Francisco has appointed Lisa Roberts as head of private wealth management for Northern California and the Pacific Northwest.  In Case You Missed It Facebook Follow: San Antonio Federal Credit Union is drawing inspiration from Facebook in how it brings its Card Control app to market. Facebook Messenger split off from the primary Facebook app in 2014. Similarly, the credit union's Card Control will be more like a companion or “sunordinate” app to the main banking app. "We wanted a mobile-first approach,” but the credit union's own mobile app was somewhat limited, said Adele Glenn, emerging channels innovation architect at San Antonio Federal. “We don't have push alerts and our vendor couldn't provide it to us.” Card Control lets members turn their cards on or off at any time, set spending thresholds and limit spending to certain merchant categories. Once users install both apps, "it will send them back and forth, the same way Facebook and Facebook Messenger work," Glenn said. "It's a seamless experience, but again, in two separate apps."  Beyond Banking The Venture Capital of China: Does the name Chen Xiaohong ring a bell? She's a former librarian who raised the largest female-founded venture capital fund ($500 million), and she's working hard to bring even more women into technology. Her fund is based in Beijing, which is particularly fertile ground for women in technology. In China, it's women who launch more than half of all new Internet companies (55%) and a quarter of all entrepreneurs are women, according to Chinese government estimates. About 17% of investing partners are women. In the U.S. 10% of investing partners are women. “The venture capital industry in the U.S. has been a private men's club,” said Gary Rieschel, an American who founded the China-based Qiming Venture Partners. “It has been much more of a meritocracy for women in China.” We recommend you read the full story about the rise of China's female VCs, how they deal with sexism and work-life balance and their efforts to inspire more women in tech. Campus Leadership: U.N. Women's HeForShe released a report that details' commitments to gender parity on the campuses of 10 international universities. Their goal is to achieve on-campus gender equality by 2020. The announcement follows a slew of high-profile campus sexual assault cases in the U.S., including that of Stanford student Brock Turner, whose six-month sentence (of which he completed half before being released) has weighed heavily on a national debate about how law and society views sexual assault.

Luke Kawa LJKawa Joanna Ossinger ossingerj September 22, 2016 — 3:34 PM EDT Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Photographer: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp The unwinding of risk parity portfolios and other systematic strategies in the wake of the recent bond 'Japantrum' has nearly run its course, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategist Marko Kolanovic.  The bank's Global Head of Quantitative and Derivatives Strategy was likened to the wizard Gandalf last year after similar calls about market flows turned out to be quite prescient. On Thursday, he wrote that "assuming that S&P 500 momentum stays positive (most likely, in our view), and that volatility does not significantly increase further (as important central banks meetings are out of the way)," the recent forced selling from funds following systematic strategies is "mostly completed."  After yields on longer-dated sovereign debt began to surge earlier this month and equity markets sold off in tandem, equity derivatives strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch warned that more than $50 billion in selling pressure was in the pipeline. Trend following and volatility targeting strategies that had levered up amid the prior period of market tranquility would now be forced to delever after the S&P 500 fell 2.45 percent on Sept. 9. That plunge constituted a shock that was "likely larger than Brexit for quant funds," according to BofA's team. After warning of an imminent selloff and spike in volatility on Sept. 6, Kolanovic now thinks the forces that exacerbated that market turmoil have dissipated. Options imbalances that contributed to the selloff in equities on Sept. 9 are no longer putting upward pressure on volatility, he said. However, that doesn't mean the market is poised to explode higher, as he also predicts limited upside.  "Short term, we favor a continuation of Value, Carry, and Reflation ‘risk-on’ trades that include long emerging market stocks, commodities, and developed market stocks that have cheap valuations," he said. "Short term upside for the whole S&P 500 index is likely not large, given already high valuations (e.g. yield sensitive and low volatility stocks) and uptick in market volatility."

 There's a hot new posting for Wall Street bankers — and it's not Hong Kong or London Matt Turner Sep. 22, 2016, 4:05 PM 48,135 facebook linkedin twitter email print Bank of America Merrill Lynch has put investment bankers on the ground in cities like Seattle (pictured) and Atlanta. Facebook/Visit Seattle Wall Street dealmakers used to be sent to Hong Kong or London to win new business. Now they're being sent to Seattle, Atlanta, and Denver. Bank of America, JPMorgan, and Citigroup have been taking steps to do more business with midsize companies in regional centers in the US, outside the traditional hubs like New York, Houston, and San Francisco. They have moved and hired dealmakers there, and they have them focused on so-called middle-market companies. The potential rewards are significant: Middle-market companies in the US and Canada paid $8.2 billion in deal fees in 2015, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch presentation. That's more than the fees netted in most of Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America combined. "This is a key focus for us as we have developed the other areas of our investment bank," Christian Meissner, the head of global corporate and investment banking at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, told Business Insider. "Relatively speaking, this represents a greater opportunity than some traditional avenues of growth." Local expertise Each bank cuts it slightly differently, but broadly speaking the largest multinational corporations are serviced by the corporate banking divisions within big global banks. These companies — think Apple, GE, Ford, and the like — have bankers crawling over them, trying to win every last piece of business they have to offer. Regional clients often complained that they received only episodic investment-banking coverage, according to Christian Meissner, the head of global corporate and investment banking at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Thomson Reuters The commercial banking divisions typically serve tens of thousands of smaller (but by no means small) companies, and it is the commercial banking clients that the banks are hoping to do more business with. "The premise behind regional investment banking starts from extending relationships from the commercial bank," James Roddy, who oversees the regional investment banking and M&A business at JPMorgan, told Business Insider. JPMorgan drew up plans in 2012 to focus on middle-market banking and now has about 50 people in the investment bank dedicated to this group of clients, having hired local, senior, experienced bankers in a handful of regional centers over the past three or four years. Each location — including Atlanta, Dallas, and Washington, DC — will typically have a managing director, an executive director, a vice president, and an associate on the ground. "This isn't about doing smaller deals," Roddy said. "It is working with people where we're already providing treasury services or commercial banking, and we have an opportunity to provide a full service that includes investment banking." The effort is paying off. Doug Petno, the chief executive of JPMorgan's commercial bank, cited growing investment-banking revenue from commercial banking clients at the bank's investor day in February. Revenue from this client segment hit $2.2 billion in 2015, and the bank has a long-term target of $3 billion. The effort is paying off. Doug Petno, the CEO of JPMorgan's commercial bank, cited growing investment-banking revenue from commercial banking clients at the bank's investor day in February. JPMorgan It's a similar story at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Many of the bank's clients told the bank they felt that it wasn't local enough and that they would get only occasional coverage from investment bankers who would fly in from New York or another major city. To remedy that, the bank has assigned about two dozen bankers over the past couple of years to focus on this segment of clients. "These are almost always existing clients of the firm," Meissner told Business Insider. "We have the commercial bank, the midmarket lending business, where we have something like 30,000 clients across the US. What's new is whereas previously they would have gotten episodic investment-banking attention, now they have a dedicated investment banker in addition to their existing relationship banker from commercial banking." Citigroup, meanwhile, is reviewing plans to put a banker in Denver as part of its energy coverage team, in addition to its existing presence in New York, Chicago, Houston, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. An opportunity that was always there The opportunity to win business in these regional cities isn't new — it's just that banks had been more focused chasing opportunities elsewhere. The renewed interest in less glamorous clients and locations comes at a time when many of these more exotic growth markets are slowing. Middle-market companies in the US and Canada paid $8.2 billion in deal fees in 2015, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch presentation. Bank of America The $8.2 billion fee pool for US and Canadian middle-market companies is comparable with the fees paid by companies in Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific excluding Japan put together. "This isn't a new idea; it's a different approach," Meissner said. Given the challenging market conditions, any area showing growth is sure to become competitive. And sure enough, the middle-market investment-banking business is now more keenly fought over than in the past, Roddy said. "It is happening right now," he said. "People are waking up to it. We've been doing it for a while, so it is nice to be ahead of the curve." NOW WATCH: This behavior could kill your chances in a Goldman Sachs interview Loading video...
