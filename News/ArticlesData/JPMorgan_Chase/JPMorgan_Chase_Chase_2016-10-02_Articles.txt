The index is called the JPM GBI aggregate diversified fund and is made up of both investment grade and high yield bonds, with an allocation of 80 percent developed market and 20 percent emerging market bonds. Global bond indexes typically only comprise about 2 to 4 percent emerging market bonds because certain countries are excluded based on credit ratings. JPMorgan said the new index is 94 percent comprised of investment grade credits with an average index rating of Aa3/AA-/AA- by Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch, respectively. "This split is a better reflection of both outstanding debt stock in the global investable landscape and the increasing economic contribution of EM countries to global GDP," said Gloria Kim, head of J.P. Morgan Global Index Research Group, in a statement. The allocation to the G3 currencies - the dollar, euro and Japanese yen - totals only 57 percent of the fund, as compared to 85 percent to 90 percent in traditional global government bond indices, analysts said. The index has a weighted average yield of 1.35 percent, Kim said in the statement, and managers at JPMorgan see it as one of their "flagship" indeces for the coming years. The index does not exclude countries based on credit ratings but does exclude countries with capital controls. JPMorgan offers around 20 benchmark indices. Its other flagship products include the JPMorgan EMBI index and GBI-emerging markets index.

JPMorgan Chase's chief executive pushed back at the Democratic presidential candidate after she criticized the U.S. banking culture amid Wells Fargo's fake account scandal. "It is outrageous that eight years after a cowboy culture on Wall Street wrecked our economy we are still seeing powerful bankers playing fast and loose with the law," Clinton said on Monday. In response, Dimon said: "When people blanket a whole class of people...that's just unfair." Wells Fargo opened credit card, checking and savings account without customers' permission and fired thousands of employees over the course of several years for the deceptive sales practices, without fixing the problem. Banks have been under a microscope both in the U.S. and abroad. Concerns are enduring about Deutsche Bank, which faces an expected multi-billion dollar fine from the U.S. government for activities prior to the mortgage crisis. Financial markets across the globe were sent into flux last week, amid reports of hedge funds reducing their exposure to Deutsche Bank as well as talks of a possible settlement. Getty Images JPMorgan Chase and Co. chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. Still, amid market worries that Deutsche is facing a capital squeeze, Dimon said he believes the German lender is going to be fine. "There is no reason that Deutsche Bank shouldn't get over its problems," the head of the largest U.S. bank by assets said of the fourth-largest European bank by assets. Deutsche shares have gotten pounded as investors worry that it has a weak capital position that is in even more danger due to a looming settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice involving the firm's mortgage-backed securities operations. The banks American Depositary Receipts are down about 47 percent in 2016 and nearly 53 percent over the past 12 months. "They have plenty of capital, plenty of liquidity," Dimon said during an telephone interview on CNBC's "Power Lunch." "We want all these banks to get through because it's better for everybody." Shares of Germany's largest bank ended Monday trading near $13, a decline of less than 1 percent. Wells Fargo shares fell 1.02 percent. —CNBC's Jeff Cox and Ted Kemp contributed to this report.

The sale process will test the possible interest of beverage companies including Coca-Cola Co and PepsiCo Inc in buying upstart beverage brands, as the soft drinks industry grapples with increasingly health-conscious consumers. Bai has hired investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co to run an auction and reach out to potential buyers, the sources said. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Bai and JPMorgan declined to comment. Bai, which means "pure" in Mandarin Chinese, sweetens its drinks with plant-based ingredients and infuses them with antioxidants from coffee fruit and white tea. It was founded in 2009 by entrepreneur Ben Weiss, who still owns a majority of the company. The Princeton, New Jersey-based company has focused on expanding distribution and advertising, premiering its first Super Bowl commercial earlier this year. Last year, drinks company Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc bought a minority stake in Bai, after signing an earlier distribution deal with the company. Like most major soda companies, Dr Pepper is known to make small investments as it seeks to spot the next brand to capture the attention of consumers. For its part, Coca-Cola has invested in organic juice maker Suja, Honest Tea and Zico Coconut Water. In the case of Honest Tea and Zico, these investments eventually led to an outright acquisition. PepsiCo bought a 90 percent stake in tea drink SoBe in 1999 before buying the entire company a year later. Still, it is not clear Dr. Pepper will follow in Coke's footsteps. In its conference call after releasing second-quarter 2015 results, Dr. Pepper's CFO, Marty Ellen, voiced wariness of an outright acquisition of Bai. "To acquire them would be just too expensive, and we are not sure the right thing to do in terms of the amount of money it would actually take to own all these businesses," Ellen said. One of the largest acquisitions of an upstart beverage brand was Coke's $4.1 billion purchase of Vitaminwater-maker Glaceau in 2007. Though lauded by analysts at the time as a way for Coke to expand its portfolio of health products, Coke last year agreed to change the wording on labels amid claims the drinks had overstated health benefits.

Amid market worries that Deutsche is facing a capital squeeze, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said he believes the German lender is going to be fine. "There is no reason that Deutsche Bank shouldn't get over its problems," the head of the largest U.S. bank by assets said of the fourth-largest European bank by assets. Deutsche shares have gotten pounded as investors worry that it has a weak capital position that is in even more danger due to a looming settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice involving the firm's mortgage-backed securities operations. The banks American Depositary Receipts are down about 47 percent in 2016 and nearly 53 percent over the past 12 months. "They have plenty of capital, plenty of liquidity," Dimon said during an telephone interview on CNBC's "Power Lunch" program.

 Here's what Space-X and a high-speed trading firm have in common Kevin McPartland, Greenwich Associates Oct. 3, 2016, 9:58 AM 1,736 facebook linkedin twitter email print SpaceX Over the last decade we've seen the talent pool for trading and space exploration become increasingly overlapped. Science-based PhDs can now either send a man to Mars or help make markets in US Government Bonds. But that's not actually the story here. NASA's bread and butter is sending rockets into space.  Bank trading desks similarly are the epicenter of bond trading.  Greenwich Associates research shows that in 2016 58% of US Treasury trading by institutional investors was handled by the top five dealers.  But the last few years have seen both NASA and the world's largest bond dealers start to outsource parts of those core functions. Whereas NASA has increasingly looked to SpaceX and other private sector companies to send rockets into space, JPMorgan, one of those top five bond dealers I just mentioned, tapped Virtu to supply its US Treasury trading infrastructure.  If you had asked anyone in the known a decade ago if either of those events seemed realistic in the future, the answer would have been a resounding no. But the more you think about it the more this and potential similar partnerships make sense.  In this case, both realized that if they partnered with someone else that could do it better, they could focus on more critical parts of their missions.  Now space exploration isn't my thing (unfortunately) so I'll leave NASA's decision alone, but the tie up between JPMorgan and Virtu is a bold one, and demonstrates the market's increasing willingness (and need) to start doing things differently. Getty/Andrew Burton When I first saw the headline about the tie up I was stunned.  How could JPMorgan, one of the most successful banks in the post-crisis era, outsource anything to a firm that for years has worked to bolster its position as a new and improved source of liquidity?  But after a few minutes it hit me - why should JPMorgan continue to build and maintain a trading infrastructure, when it can buy one for less that will perform better?  Now to be fair, JPMorgan is only replacing technology for a slice of their bond business, but the gesture is notable none the less. Interestingly Virtu isn't a particularly big volume player in the Treasury market.  They don't show up on Brokertec's top 10 list, and fixed income doesn't even get its own line in the profit section of their annual report (it is lumped together with options and "other securities").   But their reputation in other asset classes and as a technology innovator, not to mention their willingness to partner, closed the deal.  I'm sure the integration will cause pain and cost money for JPMorgan in the short term, but in the long run the now barely profitable business of trading US Treasuries will be able to operate with a lower cost base and as such a higher margin, but without hurting performance. From Virtu's perspective, and ultimately the perspective of all principle trading firms, the deal is even sweeter. Firms like GTS, KCG, Sun Trading and Virtu have spent years perfecting their ability to trade liquid instruments in a low risk, high profit way.  These firms and others like them could certainly continue on as is making money from their bread and butter business - trading.  But the last few years, capped off by the JPMorgan/Virtu deal, have shown us that some PTFs are smartly looking for new ways to capitalize on the assets they've built up over the past decade - there people, their technology and increasingly their brands. Traders work on the floor of the NYSE in New York City Thomson Reuters In 2016 the mood is dramatically different.  Speaking to the press, presenting at conferences, hiring sales people to interact with clients and selling what was in the past the secret sauce all on the table. Virtu and JPMorgan are unique in their own rights, so we won't see another deal with the exact same look and feel. And many PTFs after careful consideration will continue to stick to their knitting, not seeing the new opportunities as worth the investment or risk.   Nevertheless, we will see more partnerships between PTFs and the Street, some very close and some at arm’s length, as banks increasingly need the trading efficiencies those PTFs have spent years working to perfect.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Jessa Barron Oct 2nd 2016 12:21PM If you're thinking about opening a new rewards credit card, you may be having a hard time figuring out which card will match your wants and needs, especially since so many major credit cards offer top-notch rewards. Whether you're a new credit card holder or you've been using multiple cards for years, you'll want to be sure to maximize the benefits offered by your rewards credit cards. We've detailed three simple ways to ensure you're getting the most from your rewards credit cards. Choose the right card for your needs From cash back rewards to travel points and everything in between, there are a lot of rewards credit cards out there to choose from, so what's the trick to finding the right card for your needs? One of the easiest ways you can get the most back from your credit card is to choose one that aligns with your spending habits and interests. For example, if you commute for work or you take the kids to school, soccer practice and other extracurricular activities, a credit card that gives you cash back on gas purchases may be best for you because you'll be earning rewards on purchases you're already planning to make. Similarly, if you're a big foodie who enjoys trying out new, trendy restaurants, you'll want a credit card that gives you rewards for dining out. No matter where your interests lie, there's a card for you. To help you get started on the right foot, here's some of the top options for cash back and travel rewards credit cards. Best credit cards for various needs: 11 PHOTOS Best overall credit cards See Gallery Best overall credit cards NextAdvisor has sorted through major mass-market credit cards and reviewed each to help find the best for certain needs. Check out the credit card compare tool on AOL Finance for specific card features.

Up Next See Gallery Discover More Like This of SEE ALL BACK TO SLIDE SHOW CAPTION + HIDE CAPTION – Best cash back credit cards Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express If you frequent the grocery store, gas station or department stores, the Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express (a NextAdvisor advertiser) is for you. This card gives you 6% cash back at U.S. supermarkets (on up to $6,000/year, then it's 1%), 3% cash back on gas and select department store purchases, such as Kohl's, Macy's and Nordstrom, and 1% cash back on all other purchases. American Express also has a special offer that gets you 5% cash back on travel purchases in the first 6 months (on up to $4,000 in purchases, then it's 1%). Cardholders will also enjoy a 0% intro APR for 12 months on both purchases and balance transfers (with a 3% balance transfer fee). Plus, when you spend $1,000 in the first 3 months, you'll receive a $150 bonus! Although there is a $95 annual fee associated with this credit card, it may be worth the fee if you use the card for all of your grocery, gas and department store purchases. That said, if you're looking for a card with no annual fee, its sister card, the Blue Cash Everyday Card from American Express, offers similar cash back rewards, the same 5% bonus offer, a $100 intro bonus as well as a 0% intro APR for 12 months on purchases and balance transfers (with a 3% balance transfer fee). Chase Freedom - $150 BonusChase Freedom - $150 Bonus is another one of our top-rated cash back credit cards. It earns you 5% cash back on combined purchases in rotating categories (on up to $1,500/quarter, then it's 1%) as well as 1% cash back on any other purchases. While it may not be best for all of your regular purchases because the categories rotate on a quarterly basis, it's still a top-notch cash back credit card because its rewards usually match seasonal purchases you'll likely make throughout the year. For example, it earned 5% cash back at restaurants and wholesale clubs from July through September, and it earns 5% back at department stores, wholesale clubs and drug stores from October through December. It's important to note that you'll need to sign up for the rotating categories each quarter, but Chase will send you text or email reminders so you don't forget. As an added bonus, after you spend $500 in the first 3 months, you can earn a $150 bonus! There's no annual fee with Chase Freedom - $150 Bonus and cardholders can look forward to a generous 15-month 0% intro APR period on purchases and balance transfers (with a 5% balance transfer fee). If you're looking for a card with the same intro bonus that earns you a flat rate on every purchase, check out Chase Freedom Unlimited, which earns you 1.5% cash back on all purchases. Discover it - Cashback Match Another card that offers cash back on rotating categories, but is available to those with not-so-perfect credit is Discover it - Cashback Match. This card earns you 5% cash back on purchases in select categories -- from October through December you'll get 5% at Amazon.com, department stores and Sam's Club -- (up to $1,500/quarter, then it's 1%) as well as 1% cash back on all other purchases. Plus, at the end of your first year as a card member (note it's not calendar years), Discover will match all of the cash back you've earned. This means if you've earned $500, Discover will match that and you'll receive $1,000! Discover it - Cashback Match also offers a generous 12-month 0% intro APR period on purchases and balance transfers (with a 3% balance transfer fee) and you'll never have to pay an annual feel with this credit card. Those looking for a similar card that earns travel rewards will want to check out Discover it Miles, which earns a flat 1.5 miles per $1 spent on all purchases, has the same Discover match feature and more. Visit our cash back credit card reviews to learn more about these cards and other top options. Best travel rewards credit cards Chase Sapphire Preferred Card Holding the No. 1 spot in our Travel Rewards Credit Card Analysis for its outstanding hotel and flight redemption value of $2.19 per $100 spent is the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card. To start, this credit card earns an unlimited 2 points for every $1 spent on travel and dining, plus 1 point for every $1 spent on any other purchases. Next, after you spend $4,000 in the first 3 months from account opening, you'll earn 50,000 bonus points -- that's worth $625 toward travel when you redeem through Chase Ultimate Rewards! One major perk of the card is its points flexibility, as you have the option to transfer your points to another leading airline or hotel loyalty program at a 1:1 ratio for free. This means 100,000 Chase points equal 100,000 airline or hotel points/miles. On the other hand, if you decide to redeem your rewards for airfare, hotels, car rentals or cruises through Chase Ultimate Rewards, you'll get 25% more value. Something to note about the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card is its annual fee of $95, which is waived for the first year. Cardholders who frequently travel overseas can rest easy knowing that this card has no foreign transaction fees and includes some travel protection, like travel accident insurance and lost luggage reimbursement. Barclaycard Arrival Plus World Elite MasterCard The Barclaycard Arrival Plus World Elite MasterCard is another option if you're looking for a card with some great travel rewards on every purchase you make. That's because this card earns an unlimited 2 miles for every $1 spent on all purchases, which makes things easy because there's no need to worry about using your card for specific purchases. You also have the option to earn even more miles, as this card gives you 5% of your miles back toward your next redemption every time you redeem your miles -- for example, when you redeem 100,000 miles, 5,000 miles will be deposited into your rewards account. And when you spend $3,000 in the first 90 days, you'll earn 50,000 bonus miles -- that's enough to redeem for a $500 travel statement credit! Rounding out the card are no foreign transaction fees, a 12-month 0% intro APR on balance transfers made within 45 days of account opening and an $89 annual fee that's waived your first year. Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card Another top-option for travel rewards is the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card. It earns an unlimited 2 miles for every $1 you spend on every purchase, plus, you'll get 40,000 bonus miles -- that's worth $400 in travel -- when you spend $3,000 within 3 months of approval! The $59 annual fee is waived for the first year, you won't have to pay any foreign transaction fees when you travel overseas and the card comes with extended warranty protection. Check out our travel rewards credit card reviews to see a side-by-side comparison of these cards and learn about some of the other top names in travel rewards. Read the terms and conditions Equally as important as choosing the right rewards credit card for your needs is to understand how those rewards programs work. You'll want to be sure you read the full terms and conditions associated with the card you're applying for or own to know how your rewards are earned and how to redeem your earned rewards. This will clearly explain everything you need to know. After all, the cash back rewards or points you've accrued won't do you any good if they expire before you can redeem them. Some credit cards, like the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Credit Card or Chase Freedom Unlimited, for example, have no expiration dates for their rewards as long as the card remains open, while rewards earned with cards like the Citi Double Cash Card - 18 month BT offer will expire if you haven't earned any cash back for purchases or payments in 12 months. Although most cards will likely have terms that match the former, it's important to look into this, as you don't want to be surprised when your rewards disappear one day. You should also be aware of when and how you can redeem your rewards. If you want some flexibility when you redeem your rewards, you'll want to select a card that allows you redeem them the way you choose. Similarly, you'll want to be aware of the minimum rewards required for redemption, as those looking for the ability to redeem when they want will not want a card like the Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi that only lets you redeem your rewards as an annual reward coupon in your February billing statement. Another noteworthy detail to pay attention to in the terms and conditions is whether or not your credit card can help you with warranties on larger purchases (e.g., televisions, dishwashers or other home appliances). Some merchants will offer you an extended warranty if you pay for your purchases with a particular branded credit card, so you can avoid paying out of pocket for an extra year on a warranty. It should be noted that if anything in the terms and conditions is unclear, you can always call the card issuer to ask for clarification. Pay your bill on time In order to get the most from your credit cards, you'll want to avoid racking up any extra costs. You can do this by paying your bill on time, which helps you avoid paying late fees and penalty APRs. If you fail to pay your bill on time, you could also be at risk of losing the card's rewards, as some credit card issuers will put a halt on your earnings while you have an outstanding bill, or worse, you could completely lose the rewards you've already earned. What's even more detrimental to missing payments is that your credit scores could take a hit if you repeatedly fail to pay your bill on time. This is why it's extremely important to make sure you use your card responsibility, and only make purchases that you know you can afford to pay down. It should be noted that if you find yourself carrying a balance on a high-interest credit card, you may want to consider completing a balance transfer. While you will likely have to pay a balance transfer fee -- unless you opt for a card with a $0 intro balance transfer fee like Chase Slate -- this one-time fee is likely a lot cheaper than the interest you're currently paying on your credit card. Another thing to remember is if you're having trouble making your payments because of the due date, you can always reach out to your credit card issuer and request to have your due date moved to a different day of the month.

Widespread press reports about Deutsche Bank clients and counterparties reducing their financial exposure to the bank, including their derivatives exposures, alarmed market participants. At the same time, JPMorgan warns, the amount borrowed by euro-area banks at the ECB’s USD auction this week spiked to $6.35bn raising fears about funding. We need to wait for next week to see if this elevated dollar borrowing by euro area banks persists beyond quarter-end. But as JPMorgan’s Nikolaos Panigirtoglou warns, In our opinion it is not so much funding issues but rather derivatives exposures that more likely to trouble markets going forward if Deutsche Bank concerns continue. This is especially true if these concerns propagate into a confidence crisis inducing more rapid unwinding of derivative contracts. As we have detailed previously, Deutsche has the world’s largest so-called derivatives book—its portfolio of financial contracts based on the value of other assets. As Forbes notes, it peaked at over $75 trillion, about 20 times German GDP, but had shrunk to around $46 trillion by the end of last year. That’s around 12% of the total notional value of derivatives outstanding worldwide ($384 trillion), according to the Bank for International Settlements. As a reminder, if the liquidity run forces DB to start unwinding or being forced to novate derivatives, it could get ugly. JPMorgan bank analysts confirm the size of DB’s book, and note that BIS data provide an alternative but indirect way to gauge the size of derivatives exposures. According to BIS data the exposure of foreign banks to German counterparties via derivatives contracts stood at $312bn as of Q1 2016. Source: BIS This is significantly lower than the $408bn reported for Q1 2015, suggesting that foreign banks have cut their derivatives exposures to German counterparties significantly over the past year. But at $312bn this exposure is still large even if Deutsche Bank accounts for a fraction of this. *  *  * As we have noted previously, Deutsche Bank has around EUR 560 billion in deposits (for now) and so theoretically they do not have a funding issue. But as we have seen numerous times in Deutsche’s history above (and obviously in many other banks), when the runs start, they seldom end peacefully (and funding sources disappear very quickly). Which perhaps explains this from Germany’s financial regulator… The head of Germany’s financial regulator warned on Saturday of “negative perceptions that could lead to downward spirals on the markets”, at the end of a week that saw Deutsche Bank shares battered by a crisis of confidence.   In an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper due to be published on Sunday, the head of Bafin, Felix Hufeld, declined to comment specifically on Deutsche Bank, Germany’s biggest bank.   But he said: “I warn people not to let themselves be drawn into a kind of downward spiral of negative perception. Not every nervous market reaction is backed by objective facts.” Roughly translated as “Don’t panic, we have everything contained.” Now where have we heard that before? One thing is clear: Friday’s desperate rumor-driven ramp saved some of that deposit base as going out at record lows into a long-weekend would not have been confidence-inspiring for the deposit base. But, as JPMorgan makes clear – and we have reiterated numerous times, it’s the derivatives that matter and as the chart below shows,counterparties were piling into protection en masse – even as speculators bid up the stock on a quiet Friday afternoon. Remember how many times investors were told that Lehman had no liquidity or funding problems? However, as noted previously, Lehman failed as a result of its corporate counterparties suffocating the bank by rapidly pulling out their liquidity lines. Lehman, however, was lucky in that it didn’t have retail depositors: it’s death would have likely come far faster as the capital panic was not limited to institutions but also included a retail depositor bank run. This is where Deutsche Bank is very different from Lehman, and far riskier, because if the institutional panic spreads to the depositor base, which as the table below shows amounts to some €566 billion in total, and €307 billion in retail deposits… … then all bets are off. Which is why it is so critical for Angela Merkel to halt the plunging stock price, an indicator DB’s retail clients, simplistically (and not erroneously) now equate with the bank’s viability, and the lower the price drops, the faster they will pull their deposits, the quicker DB’s liquidity hits zero, the faster the self-fulfilling prophecy of Deutsche Bank’s death is confirmed. Which ultimately means that DB really has four options: raise capital (sell equity, convert CoCos, which may results in an even bigger drop in the stock price due to dilution or concerns the liquidity raise may not be sufficient), approach the ECB for a liquidity bridge (this may also backfire as counterparties scramble to flee a central bank-backstopped institution), appeal for a state bailout (Merkel has so far said “Nein”) or implement a bail-in, eliminating billions in unsecured claims (and deposits) and leading to a full-blown systemic bank run as depositors everywhere rush to withdraw their savings, leading to a collapse of the fractional reserve banking mode (in which there is only 10 cents in physical deliverable cash for every dollar in depositor claims). Which of the four choices Deutsche Bank will pick should become clear in the coming days.

The sale process will test the possible interest of beverage companies including Coca-Cola Co and PepsiCo Inc in buying upstart beverage brands, as the soft drinks industry grapples with increasingly health-conscious consumers. Bai has hired investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co to run an auction and reach out to potential buyers, the sources said. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Bai and JPMorgan declined to comment. Bai, which means "pure" in Mandarin Chinese, sweetens its drinks with plant-based ingredients and infuses them with antioxidants from coffee fruit and white tea. It was founded in 2009 by entrepreneur Ben Weiss, who still owns a majority of the company. The Princeton, New Jersey-based company has focused on expanding distribution and advertising, premiering its first Super Bowl commercial earlier this year. Last year, drinks company Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc bought a minority stake in Bai, after signing an earlier distribution deal with the company. Like most major soda companies, Dr Pepper is known to make small investments as it seeks to spot the next brand to capture the attention of consumers. For its part, Coca-Cola has invested in organic juice maker Suja, Honest Tea and Zico Coconut Water. In the case of Honest Tea and Zico, these investments eventually led to an outright acquisition. PepsiCo bought a 90 percent stake in tea drink SoBe in 1999 before buying the entire company a year later. Still, it is not clear Dr. Pepper will follow in Coke's footsteps. In its conference call after releasing second-quarter 2015 results, Dr. Pepper's CFO, Marty Ellen, voiced wariness of an outright acquisition of Bai. "To acquire them would be just too expensive, and we are not sure the right thing to do in terms of the amount of money it would actually take to own all these businesses," Ellen said. One of the largest acquisitions of an upstart beverage brand was Coke's $4.1 billion purchase of Vitaminwater-maker Glaceau in 2007. Though lauded by analysts at the time as a way for Coke to expand its portfolio of health products, Coke last year agreed to change the wording on labels amid claims the drinks had overstated health benefits.

REUTERS/Mike Segar JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) on Monday said it was launching a global government bond index that will offer fund managers higher potential yields by including a larger percentage of emerging market bonds than traditional global bond indexes. The index is called the JPM GBI aggregate diversified fund and is made up of both investment grade and high yield bonds, with an allocation of 80 percent developed market and 20 percent emerging market bonds. Global bond indexes typically only comprise about 2 to 4 percent emerging market bonds because certain countries are excluded based on credit ratings. JPMorgan said the new index is 94 percent comprised of investment grade credits with an average index rating of Aa3/AA-/AA- by Moody’s, Standard & Poor's and Fitch, respectively. "This split is a better reflection of both outstanding debt stock in the global investable landscape and the increasing economic contribution of EM countries to global GDP," said Gloria Kim, head of J.P. Morgan Global Index Research Group, in a statement. The allocation to the G3 currencies - the dollar, euro and Japanese yen - totals only 57 percent of the fund, as compared to 85 percent to 90 percent in traditional global government bond indices, analysts said. The index has a weighted average yield of 1.35 percent, Kim said in the statement, and managers at JPMorgan see it as one of their "flagship" indices for the coming years. The index does not exclude countries based on credit ratings but does exclude countries with capital controls. JPMorgan offers around 20 benchmark indices. Its other flagship products include the JPMorgan EMBI index and GBI-emerging markets index. (Reporting by Dion Rabouin; Editing by Andrew Hay) Next In Business News Can Trump make coal great again?

Good morning! We’re here today to reflect and build on five years of a project that many of you in this room know well: the Global Cities Initiative. We at Brookings, and many of you, have burned a lot of airplane miles—maybe earned some elite airline statuses—as a result of your participation in GCI.  So, I want to thank you for coming here to Washington. It’s the first time we are bringing together leaders from across the Global Cities network. Nearly 40 U.S. and international cities are here today as well as other fellow travelers who have participated in this important work. I have to admit: I’m simply humbled by the sea of change that has occurred as a result of GCI. Brookings scholars brought you research, roundtables, advice, and peer-to-peer learning opportunities. In turn, you have changed the field of urban practice. When we started more than five years ago, no metropolitan area had a comprehensive trade and investment strategy. Now, more than two dozen cities are implementing one. When we started, city leaders, firms and institutions were hyper-insular – at least in the U.S. – just focusing on doing business within our domestic borders. Today, global trade has become an essential part of regional economic development’s DNA. And when we started, cities and suburbs competed for jobs, luring firms away from their neighbors next door. Today… well, that’s a work in progress. But cities and their surrounding counties are working together, emphasizing helping existing businesses grow through new markets. The irony now is that all this energy and progress comes amidst a new environment: growing skepticism about global trade, concerns about immigrants and refugees, and pessimism about a slow-growing world economy. So this summit comes at an important inflection point. How can cities deepen their efforts to be globally engaged and competitive while addressing head on the disparities and negative consequences that come with greater global integration? To set the conversation, we released a new book and two new reports. (We’re a think tank, after all!) The book, “Global Cities: A Short History,” is written by Brookings expert and tireless globetrotter Greg Clark. It explores the origins of world cities in history and discusses their challenges today. “The Making of Global Cities,” a new paper which I have co-authored with Rachel Barker and Marek Gootman, shares stories about how cities within the GCI network have adopted new approaches to become more global. And “Redefining Global Cities,” which is authored by my colleagues Jesus Trujillo and Joe Parilla, introduces a new typology of global cities based on extensive quantitative analysis of the largest metropolitan economies in the world. This morning, I’m going to talk about three things, building off of this body of work. First, I’ll discuss Brookings’ journey to understanding what it means to be a global city. Second, I’ll outline seven types of global cities that reflect the different paths to achieving global prosperity. Third, I’ll describe how our new typology of cities can inform future strategies to improve global growth and opportunity.  My presentation will be followed by two panel discussions that will further explore what’s next for global cities. To begin, what makes a global city? Global cities are not a new concept. Greg’s book traces the roots of global cities back to the beginnings of civilization. He finds that trade is a defining feature of global cities: for millennia, cities have been focal points for exchange of goods, ideas, capital, and people. But our story, as it relates to global cities, is a lot shorter than Greg’s Short History. Brookings Metro began studying global cities during the Great Recession. By 2009, the U.S. economy was in free fall, losing nearly seven and a half million jobs in just two years. Consumer demand and business spending were down. What was going to be the source of economic growth going forward? The answer was not to repeat the mistakes of the past – an economy driven by debt, consumption, and real estate. With the rise of the global middle class, we at Brookings realized that it was time for cities to embrace exports as an important ingredient for long-term, high-quality economic growth. Get daily updates from Brookings Enter Email Brookings began by examining the role that exports played in U.S. metropolitan economies. Our report, Export Nation, provided first-ever metro-level data on exports. Around the same time, President Obama introduced the National Export Initiative, a challenge to double America’s exports by 2014. Shortly thereafter, we created what we called the Metropolitan Export Initiative, which sought to tackle the President’s challenge from the bottom-up. Through MEI, we worked with leaders in four cities – Los Angeles, Portland, Syracuse, and Minneapolis-St. Paul – to apply our new research and pilot new strategies for metro-led export growth. Their experiences led to our report, 10 Steps to Delivering a Successful Metro Export Plan, to guide export planning in other cities. We were then pleased to find a partner in JPMorgan Chase who understood the power of cities to spur national economic recovery. With the support of JPMorgan Chase, we launched the Global Cities Initiative, which took this nascent idea to scale, broadening its reach to dozens of cities in the US and across the world. Author Amy Liu Vice President and Director - Metropolitan Policy Program Twitter amy_liuw Over the past five years, the Global Cities Initiative has convened leaders across six continents. From Jacksonville to Johannesburg, Santiago to Stockholm, Barcelona to Baltimore, we helped cities raise awareness about the importance of global trade and design strategies to bolster global competitiveness. In time, we realized that being a global city wasn’t simply about exports or FDI: to trade, cities needed innovation to create world-class products and services, a skilled workforce to deliver those solutions, and modern infrastructure to connect business travelers and goods to markets across the globe. Today, the work to deliver global growth and opportunity remains urgent.  Since 2009, jobs and productivity have grown, surpassing their pre-recession levels, but that growth remains sluggish. Meanwhile, wages have eroded for most Americans. Furthermore, the three forces that gave rise to global cities are also challenging cities’ path to inclusive growth. The first is urbanization. Cities are increasingly the places where global growth and economic opportunity reside. In 1950, fewer than 30 percent of the world’s residents lived in cities. By 2014, more than half of the world’s population lived in urban areas, and that share is expected to grow in the decades to come. Urbanization has led to the rise of the global middle class, connected rural workers to jobs, and raised living standards worldwide. However, how we manage urbanization will shape our ability to create opportunity for all. Urban infrastructure and housing supply often struggle to keep up with the influx of new migrants. 880 million people—or 30 percent of all urban residents in developing countries—live in informal housing. In the developed world, skyrocketing housing costs burden low- and middle-income urban residents. Globalization continues to move full speed ahead. It’s true that the growth of global trade has slowed in the past couple of years. But over the longer run, cross-border flows of goods, capital, and services have exploded and now amount to 39 percent of global GDP. International trade benefits consumers worldwide by lowering the costs of goods and services and increasing the availability of new products. It also opens new markets for firms, allowing companies to grow and pay higher wages. But, as this election cycle has reminded us, not all people and places share equally in the benefits of global trade. David Autor at MIT estimates that 2.4 million jobs, including 1 million manufacturing jobs, were lost in the United States in recent years due to import competition from China. Cities must explicitly help impacted communities and industries adjust and succeed. The third force is technology. In recent decades, technology has spurred the formation of global supply chains and connected businesses to each other and to consumers worldwide. Today, explosive new technologies, from cloud computing, robotics, autonomous vehicles, and the internet of things, are generating massive new value in industries and creating good jobs in cities. But new technologies can also destroy firms and displace workers. As a recent McKinsey report found, 60 percent of all occupations are at risk of partial or complete automation. Meanwhile, the rise of the gig economy is complicating the definition of stable, full-time employment. What makes a global city? Ultimately, being a global city means being a globally competitive city. The Global Cities Initiative is no longer just a response to the Great Recession but a recognition that our cities must constantly adapt their policies and institutions in the face of rapid change to create growth and opportunity for our citizenry. To adapt effectively, cities must embrace the core drivers and enablers of competitiveness. Traded sectors are one driver of competitiveness: every metro area relies on a set of distinctive industries, especially advanced industries, that grow through trade, bringing wealth and income into a region. Another is innovation, such as applied research capabilities, new technologies, and a culture of entrepreneurship, which allows traded sectors to grow. The last is talent: metropolitan areas also need communities that steadily produce, attract, and retain workers with the skills to power those key sectors. Modern infrastructure and good governance enable competitive regional economies. They connect workers, suppliers, and customers together and create a climate of transparency and trust that fosters civic problem-solving. This brings me to my second point: All cities are global, but not in the same way. Our new report defines seven types of global cities based on how they perform on these core drivers and enablers of global competitiveness. To create this typology, we studied the world’s 123 largest metropolitan economies, nearly all of which have GDP exceeding $100 billion. These cities are economically significant: home to just 13 percent of the world’s population, they generate one-third of the world’s economic output. We then assessed how these cities performed on three categories of indicators: their economic characteristics, including the size of the economy, their industry mix, and their competitiveness factors. That assessment ultimately revealed seven types of global cities, each with their own distinctive roles in the global economy and pathways to future growth and prosperity. Let’s look at each of these seven city types in turn. First is Global Giants – including London, Paris, and Tokyo – represent the traditional notion of a global city.  These are large, highly sophisticated financial hubs of the world economy. Global Giants are set apart by the massive size of their economies, and their extensive global connectivity. New York, with a GDP of nearly $1.5 trillion and 192 million air travelers annually, is truly at the center of the world economy. Second, Asian Anchors – including Hong Kong, Beijing, and Seoul – serve as leading economic centers for the fastest-growing continent in the world. What makes this type most distinct is that they outpace all other cities on foreign investment.  With stable governance and the world’s most modern infrastructure systems, Asian Anchors are where international businesses go to establish operations in Asia. Singapore is a good example of an Asian Anchor: this city-state captured nearly $82 billion of foreign direct investment in 2015, the most among all global metros, and has the fastest internet download speeds in the world. Next up are Emerging Gateways – including Mumbai, Rio, and Santiago – which offer entry points to their nation’s economies. These 28 financial and political capitals have traded sectors that are on average four times more productive than their nation’s average. Yet compared to other global cities, they often fall behind on innovation. Mexico City is an Emerging Gateway: it has a very productive traded sector, but only 6.2 percent of its research papers are frequently cited, ranking just 105th out of the 123 global cities. Fourth, Factory China – including Chengdu, Nantong, and Wenzhou – represent China’s major manufacturing hubs. These cities are the fastest-growing economies in the world. But they are heavily dependent on production and have limited talent pools and innovative assets. Hefei is emblematic of a Factory China metro: its economy has grown nearly 15 percent each year since 2000, ranking first among all global cities. Yet only 12 percent of its adult population holds a college degree, placing the city near the bottom of global city rankings. Fifth, Knowledge Capitals – including Boston, San Francisco, and Stockholm – are economies bolstered by elite research institutions and industries which together create cutting-edge products and services. These cities often have an extremely well-educated and productive workforce, and boast some of the highest rates of scientific research, patents, and venture capital in the world. San Diego is a Knowledge Capital: its output per worker is 11th highest across the 123 metros, and it produces an average of over 5 patents per 1,000 persons each year, second-best among all cities. Next, American Middleweights – including Charlotte, Phoenix, and Kansas City – are mid-sized American metro areas, many of which have participated in the Global Cities Initiative. These cities are still trying to find their footing in the global economy. But they have valuable economic assets: each maintains at least one globally-relevant export industry, and many have elite research institutions that attract talent and contribute to innovation. Indianapolis is a good example of an American Middleweight. The metro area’s traded sectors are less productive than the U.S. average, ranking 109th out of 123 global cities. But over 14 percent of research papers coming out of Indy’s universities are among the most cited in their field, which is 42nd best among all global cities. Finally, International Middleweights – including Munich, Melbourne, and Montreal – are economies that, like their American counterparts, are seeking to leverage distinctive economic assets. These metros serve as gateways to smaller developed economies, and therefore have high rates of foreign investment. Unfortunately, many of them also have a growth challenge. Barcelona is an example of an International Middleweight. Its economy has grown only 1.2 percent annually since 2000, ranking 106th out of 123 global metros. But the city is also a destination not just for foreign travelers, but for foreign capital. With $3,400 of foreign investment per person in 2015, Barcelona ranks 8th among all global cities. There are of course many other cities beyond these 123, including cities represented by people in this room. We believe this typology helps all cities better understand how they fit into the global economy. So, what should a local leader takeaway from this typology?  First, all cities are globalizing. The world economy is hyper-connected because the firms and industries in cities are increasingly global. So the implication for metropolitan leaders is that their policies and strategies must embrace—not reject—this economic reality. Second, cities occupy distinctive niches in the global economy. Some cities are innovation hubs; others are centers of manufacturing. Some anchor the world’s largest economies, others are gateways to developing countries.  Cities can use this typology to find true peer groups for learning and economic exchange, and put global rankings in context.  Third, cities must continuously adapt to be globally competitive and inclusive.  Metro strategies must improve a region’s value-add in global supply chains while increasing the participation of people and communities in that growth. This brings me to the final section: how can cities increase their global competitiveness and create shared prosperity? Our new report compares each city type on key indicators of economic growth and their competitiveness assets. These data frame general strengths and challenges facing each type of global city, based on how they perform on each indicator. Let’s take a look at a few metros in the Global Cities network that are actively adapting to the unique global challenges they face. Global giants retain multiple advantages that have been built up over decades, even centuries. Yet, even Global Giants like London understand that no advantage lasts forever in a hyper-competitive global marketplace. Many Global Giants recognize that they need to continuously upgrade the competitiveness of their traded sectors, which are often middling in growth because of their size. For instance, London has been seeking to diversify its economy beyond its world-leading financial industry. Now in the wake of Brexit, that objective is even more urgent. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has an International Business Programme that provides mentoring and support to fast-growing London companies in technology, life sciences, and urban infrastructure to help them export and expand. Emerging Gateways are rapidly reaching middle-income status in their developing countries. But on a global scale, these cities still lag their more developed peers on key measures of innovation, such as scientific research and patents. Santiago exemplifies this dynamic. The city is trying to make the transition from an economy reliant on natural resources to one that generates value through knowledge and innovation. There has been a concerted effort of both the private and the public sector to support entrepreneurship, from Startup Chile to Ideas Factory —a unique combination of makers’ space, incubator, accelerator, and shared workspace. Santiago also recognizes the need to improve access to quality education, which, if left unaddressed, will perpetuate inequalities. American Middleweights, as I mentioned before, are wealthy by global standards, but continue to seek a new identity to break out on the global stage – and doing so requires strengthening their tradable sectors. In Columbus, Ohio, Columbus 2020, the region’s economic development organization—in coordination with the Mayor’s office and the business community—has launched a global trade and investment strategy. With a diverse economy, the metro’s leaders are boosting their existing specializations by helping each become more trade-intensive. They are re-orienting economic development away from business attraction and towards a stronger relationship with existing firms. Their efforts have led to a more strategic and demand-driven approach to workforce development, export sales abroad, and inbound foreign investment. Let me close with this quote from Nobel Prize economist Joseph Stiglitz: “The problem is not globalization, but how the process of globalization is being managed.” The leaders we have had the pleasure to work with are better prepared than ever to manage this process. Rather than be bystanders to global change, many of you are proactively shaping it. You know the needs of your leading industries. You know how global forces are putting pressure on them to digitize and innovate, and how that translates to demand for different kinds of skills. You may have learned about new industry opportunities that inspired you to bring different firms and sectors together to co-create new products.  This newfound global awareness is empowering you to solve problems, collaborate, and create the local conditions for firms and workers to be part of global success. Indeed, there is more work we must to do ensure that global competitiveness results in opportunities for all. But if the last five years are any indication, cities will rise to the challenge and lead the way. Thank you for a tremendous journey, and we look forward to more collaboration with you in the months and years to come.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search JPMorgan Analyst Says Fed Might Need to Buy Stocks Next October 3, 2016 6:29am NYSE:DIA NYSE:SPY ShareTweet From Tyler Durden: Just a few days after Janet Yellen and Larry Summers advocated for the Federal Reserve to buy equities, now a prominent JPMorgan analyst has joined the short but growing list of people in favor of nationalizing the stock market. During her latest testimony in Congress, when asked by rep Mick Mulvaney if the Fed has considered buying equities, Janet Yellen had a cryptic, yet open to interpretation answer: “the Federal Reserve is not permitted to purchase equities. We can only purchase U.S. treasuries and agency securities. I did mention in a speech in Jackson Hole, though, where I discussed longer term issues and difficulties we could have in providing adequate monetary policy. Accommodation may be somewhere in the future, down the line that this is the kind of thing that Congress might consider.” Then, the very next day, during a video conference Q&A, Yellen once again unexpectedly latched on to the topic of the Fed buying stocks, saying that “the idea of expanding into areas like equities might be “good thing to think about,” noting that (for now) The Fed is more restricted in which assets it can purchase than other central banks. If we found, I think as other countries did, that they could reach the limits in terms of purchasing safe assets like longer-term government bonds, it could be useful to be able to intervene directly in assets where the prices have a more direct link to spending decisions.” Assets such as equities. Then, jumping on to the idea of nationalizing the stock market, none other than the world’s most farcical former econopundit, Larry Summers, who has plunged to such recent depths he has to retweet himself on Twitter to get page views for his blog, “floated the idea of continuous purchases of stocks as a potential ingredient in a recipe for the developed world to strengthen economies struggling with subdued growth and inflation.” Cited by Bloomberg, Summer said that among the proposals that deserve “serious reflection” is the purchase of a “wider range of assets on a sustained and continuing basis,” Summers said in a lecture at a Bank of Japan conference in Tokyo Friday. “I’m not prepared to make a policy recommendation at this point,” he told reporters later. It got even funnier when Summers said that “there are obviously important political and economic questions associated with government ownership of companies,” adding that “some critics could term such a policy as “socialism, while others could highlight that governments already buy stocks in other ways, such as in the U.S. for federal employee pension funds.” Still others could term such a policy as utter idiocy, because once a price-indiscriminate entity is unleashed on stocks directly and legally (as opposed to the current framework whereby the Fed merely intervenes by way of its HFT proxy, Citadel, at key inflection points to break selling momentum), it is game over for price discovery and for the concept of capitalism. However, one would not find JPM among the “others.” In a note released on Friday, the otherwise serious commentator Nick Panigirtzoglou, author of the closely followed “Flows and Liquidity” weekly publication, when discussing the limits of QE – a topic prominently touched upon by Bridgewater this past week, said the following: How big are the QE capacity constraints facing central banks? One of the arguments put forward by some in explaining the BoJ’s shift away from QE to yield targeting is for the BoJ to avoid finding itself in the same position as the ECB is currently: i.e. facing a QE cliff at a not too distant point in the future. We believe that QE constraints are rather artificial. One of the channels via which QE operates is via bolstering the capacity of debt capital markets. Indeed, this year’s big increase in spread product supply coincided with more QE by the ECB and the BoJ relative to the previous year. More bond issuance not only implies more credit creation, helping the economy, but also more QE capacity allowing central banks to purchase more assets in the future. But QE need not be confined to bond instruments in our mind. By limiting themselves to bonds, central banks are indeed deemed to face quantitative constraints given declining government bond issuance even as spread product issuance has increased. This year’s purchases by the ECB, BoJ and the BoE account for 75% of total net bond issuance globally excluding EM local debt. And there you have it: first, a central banker, then a still somewhat prominent (if recently discredited) economist, and now a respected sell-side analyst, have all jumped on the “Fed should buy equities” bandwagon. We point this out just because it increasingly appears that the Fed is launching trial balloons at what its next, emergency policy may be at a time when the US central bank should, according to experts, be getting ready to hike rates. Which is why, something tells us that the market’s 59% odds of a December rate hike as of December will be, as usually, dramatically wrong.

But few are as reliant on this business - be it swapping currencies, selling bonds or structuring derivatives - as Deutsche Bank, the giant lender that has made its name not as a home for German savers but as a place for hedge funds and other risk-loving investors to put on some of their boldest financial bets.

And that is why its swooning stock price last week set off alarm bells in finance ministries, central bank suites and trading floors from Hong Kong to New York. More than eight years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers sent shock waves around the world, the fear is whether Deutsche Bank and its highly leveraged balance sheet of €1.6 trillion ($2.3 trillion) might teeter and set off another bout of financial contagion. Related Content It's not just Deutsche. European banking is utterly broken Deutsche Bank settlement could help Australian stocks Those worries calmed down somewhat late last week as Deutsche Bank's shares rose after reports that the bank may be close to cutting a deal with the US Justice Department regarding the fine it must pay for selling toxic mortgages during the financial crisis. 'Strong fundamentals' There has also been a growing realisation that Deutsche Bank, even with its thin cushion of cash, is in much better financial shape than Lehman Brothers was. In a letter to employees on Friday, Deutsche's chief executive, John Cryan, highlighted the "strong fundamentals" of the bank. Advertisement It has €220 billion ($323 billion) in ready liquidity, compared with $US45 billion ($59 billion) for Lehman in 2007, and the bank can also tap central banks in the United States and in Europe for a financial lifeline if need be. That does not mean, however, that traders and regulators will stop fretting about, among other things, the €42 trillion of derivatives that sit on its books, an amount about the size of the German economy. The market value of that figure, €18 billion, is a lot lower, but as a headline sum it still scares. In a letter to employees on Friday, Deutsche's chief executive, John Cryan, highlighted the "strong fundamentals" of the bank. Photo: AP More than all other universal banks - those institutions that collect deposits and also have investment banking businesses - Deutsche Bank has cultivated bankers with an expertise in conceiving of, promoting and trading some of the most cutting-edge financial instruments around. Its past leader, Anshu Jain, came to the firm in the 1990s from Merrill Lynch and rose to the top through his success in selling derivatives to hedge funds. Long before he became co-chief executive in 2012, Jain and a loyal cadre of like-minded bankers and traders consolidated power in London (the bank's headquarters are in Frankfurt), where they established the bank as a behemoth in the markets. 'Fragile equation' Deutsche Bank became one of the few banks large and aggressive enough to put its capital at risk by trading and housing derivatives, securitised mortgages and credit default swaps for those who wanted to deal in them. "What makes Deutsche Bank systemic is their sheer size combined with the leverage that is required to stay in the flow and be an intermediary," said Anthony J. Perrotta Jr, an expert in the structure of financial markets at TABB Group, a consulting firm. "But as capital becomes more scarce, this becomes a fragile equation." A simple calculation bears this out. Deutsche Bank has €67 billion in equity that supports assets of €1.6 trillion, which mean it is levered at a ratio of 25 to 1. By comparison, JPMorgan has $US224 billion in cash backing $US2.4 trillion in assets, which produces a far healthier ratio of 9 to 1. Making Deutsche Bank's ratio more troubling is that many of these assets are of the most illiquid variety, called Level 3 securities, for which establishing a price is guesswork and finding a buyer near impossible. According to the last annual report, Level 3 assets stood at €32 billion - about half the amount of the bank's equity buffer, although that figure has come down sharply in recent years. To get a better sense of how these types of assets ended up on its balance sheet, it is worth taking a closer look at the professional make-up of Deutsche Bank's investment bank. In good times this unit of the bank drove its profits. It was also the investment bank that was largely responsible for the $US7.5 billion in losses that Deutsche Bank showed last year. Because of new European Union regulations, Deutsche Bank is required to disclose the number of those who take significant risks with the bank's capital and how much they are paid. Risk takers Last year, the bank reported that its investment bank employed 1871 so-called material risk takers, or MRTs as they have come to be known in European regulatory circles, who were paid €1.7 billion. That was down from a year earlier, when 2057 MRTs took home €2 billion. Stuart Graham, a banking analyst with Autonomous Research in London, says Deutsche Bank has more high-paid risk takers than any other bank - including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse. Barclays, a long-time Deutsche rival, is also a deposit-taking bank that relies on traders to increase revenues. But the British bank reports having just 842 maximum risk takers in its investment bank. While this culture of making big bets with the bank's cash may have worked in a previous era, in today's market, where a premium is placed on managing risk as opposed to taking it, such an aptitude becomes a liability. So, even though Deutsche Bank may have a €220 billion cash cushion, it is this unknown liability that is causing some investors to play it safe and ask for their money back. "If you are a counterparty, you have to trim back exposure as fast as you can," said David Hendler, a credit analyst with Viola Risk Advisors. Capital raising Most analysts believe Deutsche Bank needs to raise an extra €5 billion to €7 billion from investors in order to calm concerns about its financial health, especially in light of the fact that the Justice Department may require the firm to pay a penalty of at least this amount. But there are a few who think that for Deutsche Bank to be able to survive a crisis-like atmosphere, it needs a lot more money than that. Robert Engle, an economist at New York University who was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work on volatility and capital markets, has designed a model that ranks financial institutions in terms of their systemic risk. The barometer takes into consideration leverage, the bank's stock price and its equity base, and as such it represents a real-time measure of the dangers a bank poses to the financial system at a given moment in time. Global regulators use it as well to complement their own internal models. Risk ranking As of now, Deutsche Bank is ranked top among European banks in terms of risk, requiring close to €100 billion in fresh cash to ensure that it could survive a sustained sell-off in the markets. Other European banks, like BNP Paribas and Societe Generale, rank closely behind Deutsche Bank in this regard. What sets Deutsche Bank apart from its European and American peers is its reliance on debt, the NYU model shows. Since September, the bank's risk, calculated on the basis of its leverage, has increased sharply relative to other comparable institutions, according to the NYU gauge. "There is just a lot of risk for Deutsche Bank right now," Engle said. "We have been worried about European banks for quite a while."

Only the Commonwealth Bank of Australia – out of the 13 investment banks invited – signed the letter, which was triggered by a court case last year. Sources familiar with Goldman Sachs’ decision said it declined to sign the petition letter over fears of setting a precedent that would see individual court cases being influenced, and opening the door to a flood of other future petition campaigns. Airport outrage shows Hong Kong government full of hot air on LGBT rights Fern Ngai, chief executive of Community Business, the non-profit group behind the campaign, said: “The petition, which was set up last year, is open to the public and we encouraged everyone to sign. In terms of why so few banks signed, it could be attributed to a number of  factors including having to go through internal legal and compliance approval processes, or that an online public petition may not be an appropriate channel for  advocating for change, for example, in government policies or for LGBT rights. Not signing the petition does not necessarily indicate lack of support.” Community Business asked the banks to support the petition because the same banks last year had lobbied for and received awards from the non-profit group endorsing them as the city’s top employers supporting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) inclusiveness in the workplace. Other banks that were named top LGBT employers last year, but which hadn't signed the new petition, included Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Standard Chartered, Barclays Capital, Nomura, ANZ, UBS and Credit Suisse. HSBC spokesman Gareth Hewett said the bank “prefers to work through other channels to support the LGBT community, using our senior leadership where appropriate and ensuring they are kept up to date with the latest developments”. University of Hong Kong accused of trying to brainwash campus with unisex, LGBT-friendly toilets Steven Victorin, global head of corporate banking subsidiaries at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said: “It is true in Hong Kong that a couple in a same-sex marriage doesn’t have the ability to secure visas for both individuals in the same way other married couples can. “If you are looking at the fundamental rights of securing visas today, there are limitations that we look forward to working with the appropriate government agencies on. It’s going to take some time,” He added that lobbying in Hong Kong for this is “not really something that’s being done in the community here”. Community Business started the campaign in support of a woman identified only by her pseudonym “QT”, who took the Hong Kong government to court last year after the Immigration Department denied her same-sex spouse a dependent visa, even though the couple were legally married in a foreign country. Her lawyers argued that the visa would have routinely been granted to a heterosexual couple. QT lost the case in March but lodged an appeal which will be heard again in court next year. Her case has since inspired more suits by other couples in similar situations. Ngai said her group received eight more enquiries relating to such cases.   This article was amended to correct the headline and the comment attributed to Community Business.

This month, historically, has earned a formidable reputation of providing dismal returns ahead of elections, while concerns about Deutsche Bank AG (USA) (DB) have rattled the financial markets. Meanwhile, uncertainties surrounding the Fed rate hike coupled with high valuations are expected to aggravate concerns. To overcome the market adversities, it will be judicious to invest in stocks that boast strong fundamentals and are less volatile than the broader markets. Election to Spur Volatility Elections traditionally lead to stock market volatility and it won’t be any different this time around. According to the Stock Trader’s Almanac, which dates back to 1950, the S&P 500 averages a decline of 0.7% and the Dow industrials averages a 0.8% drop. The performance of the more-volatile indices like the Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 is worse, with an average setback of over 2%. The head-to-head between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is quite a close one. Ahead of the first U.S. presidential debate, Trump took a two-point lead over Clinton, but it was Clinton who held an edge over Trump in the first presidential debate by displaying a better degree of preparedness on matters concerning public policy, defense and tax reform (read more: 3 Stocks to Watch after Hillary Clinton’s Debate Performance). VIX to Rise The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), a gauge of near-term investor anxiety, has always risen from the month of September to October, except for 1996, when Bill Clinton handily won the re-elections. Thanks to such increasing uncertainty, some of the imminent strategists had already expressed their concerns.  Here are some of their comments: From JPMorgan Chase strategists led by Dubravko Lakos-Bujas: “2016 election will likely be a source of heightened volatility in the weeks ahead of November 8th.” From David Kostin and colleagues at Goldman Sachs: “Equity market uncertainty typically rises in the month immediately ahead of presidential elections, and we believe the current below-average level of uncertainty is unlikely to persist.” From Mandy Xu and colleagues at Credit Suisse: “Historically, we find that elections have been a meaningful driver of equity volatility.” Deutsche Bank Adds to Woes More uncertainty looms large this month as Deutsche Bank’s woes continue to spook investors.  The German lender endured questions like whether it was losing the confidence of investors after a handful of hedge funds that clear derivatives through the bank withdrew excess cash and positions. Shares of Deutsche Bank tanked to fresh lows, only to rebound on September  30 and end the week at a gain of 1.4%. Reports continued to circulate that the bank may be able to negotiate a less-onerous settlement with the Justice Department than the $14-billion figure being discussed earlier. German Chancellor Angela Merkel had already refused to offer state aid to the giant lender. 7 Stock Charts to Watch in October Nonetheless, shares of the lender plunged more than 50% this year as investors remain worried about the institution’s thin capital cushion. Such a decline affected other European banks, already plagued by Eurozone’s weak economy and negative interest rates. Fed Rate Hike Dilemma, Stretched Valuations September jobs data is due on Oct 7. The outcome can also help shape market perception in the coming weeks. A December rate hike is more likely, but, if the jobs data turn out to be mediocre like the August one, it might indicate that the domestic economy is in a tight spot. Lest we forget, a slew of discouraging retail sales reports, pending home sales and manufacturing numbers seem to hint at sluggish growth. The market is already in a precarious situation, as most analysts warn that stock market valuations are at elevated levels. This makes the market more vulnerable to a volatile sell-off. The S&P 500’s forward 12-month P/E ratio is currently at around 16.6, way above the 5-year average of over 14.8. It is also worth noting that earnings are not just lackluster, they are negative. Total earnings for the S&P 500 index are currently expected to be down 2.8% in the third quarter from the same quarter last year (read more: Q3 Earnings Season Preview). Torrid Times Ahead? 5 Solid Picks Amid such uncertainties, it seems sensible to buy stocks that are fundamentally strong and will continue to do business even in the worst of times. Investors should also build a strategy on low risk assets and a combination of parameters that lead to better returns. The best way to go about doing so is by creating a portfolio of low beta stocks, which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in. We have selected five such stocks that boast of a VGM score of ‘A’. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. Such stocks also have a beta that ranges from 0 to 1. Also, these stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

The Maximum Tender Offer was made pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the offer to purchase dated September 19, 2016 (the “Offer to Purchase”). As of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on September 30, 2016 (the “Early Tender Date”), as reported by Global Bondholder Services Corporation, the tender and information agent for the Maximum Tender Offer, the principal amounts of the Notes listed in the table below had been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn. The applicable Reference Yield, Repurchase Yield and Total Consideration (as defined below) for the principal amount of such Notes accepted for purchase are detailed in the table below.

In addition to the applicable total consideration specified in the table above (the “Total Consideration”) for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date and accepted for payment, Hess will pay accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, October 4, 2016, the expected settlement date, for the Notes tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date in the Maximum Tender Offer. The applicable Total Consideration was calculated in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase by reference to the applicable fixed spread for such Note (the “Fixed Spread”) specified in the table above plus the applicable yield to maturity based on the bid-side price of the applicable U.S. Treasury Reference Security specified in the table above at 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 3, 2016. The Total Consideration also includes the applicable early tender payment for each $1,000 principal amount of such Note specified in the table above (the “Early Tender Payment”). The Maximum Tender Offer will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on October 17, 2016, unless extended or earlier terminated. Because the Maximum Tender Offer has been fully subscribed as of the Early Tender Date, holders who tender Notes after the Early Tender Date will not have any of their Notes accepted for purchase. Any Notes tendered after the Early Tender Date, together with any Notes tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date but not accepted for purchase by Hess, will be returned to the holders thereof as described in the Offer to Purchase. The withdrawal deadline for the Maximum Tender Offer was 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on September 30, 2016 (the “Withdrawal Deadline”) and has not been extended. Accordingly, previously tendered Notes and Notes tendered after the Withdrawal Deadline may not be withdrawn, subject to applicable law. Hess plans to fund the Maximum Tender Offer with part of the proceeds from the sale of its 4.30% Notes due 2027 and its 5.80% Notes due 2047, which was completed on September 28, 2016.

The story, which cites unnamed sources familiar with the situation, states that Bai has hired JP Morgan Chase & Co. to conduct an auction and contact potential buyers. Launched in 2009 Bai markets still and sparkling lines of its coffeefruit-infused Antioxidant Infusion drinks, which sweetened with a blend of erythritol and organic stevia, contain 5 calories per 8 oz. serving. Bai also markets an enhanced water called Antiwater. In April, 2015, Dr Pepper Snapple Group (DPSG), the primary distributor of Bai beverages, acquired a $15 million minority stake in Bai, based on a $500 million dollar valuation. Weiss told BevNET at the time that Bai had turned a profit for the first time earlier that year. The Reuters article identifies The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo as two parties potentially interested in acquiring Bai. DPSG is also a potential suitor for Bai, however, Reuters notes that DPSG CFO Marty Ellen, in a conference call related to second-quarter 2015 results, cast doubt on his company’s prospects of purchasing Bai outright, saying “to acquire them would be just too expensive.” Nevertheless, Bai has proven to be an exceptional brand in recent years: Inc. Magazine recently pegged Bai’s 2015 revenue at nearly $120 million, with three-year growth of 2,210 percent. Reached by e-mail, Bai founder and CEO Ben Weiss had no comment on the Reuters report.

Chicago’s struggling schools made millions for 'Wall Street' The Wall Street Journal The Chicago school system needed money—fast. Two Wall Street players saw an opportunity to invest. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Chicago-based Nuveen Asset Management have made realized and paper profits exceeding $110 million on purchases this year of $763 million in Chicago Public Schools bonds. The school system has said it needed the money to replenish its dwindling coffers before the new school year and to build and repair facilities. The terms of the bond sales highlight the choices the school district faces after years of pension shortfalls and relying heavily on borrowing. The 397,000-student school district struggled to sell municipal bonds in February until Nuveen bought about one-third, and the district decided in July to borrow directly from J.P. Morgan for fear that investors might balk again, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Board of Education said.

The Summit reinforced the importance of global competitiveness and engagement, highlighted major urban innovations underway, and catalyzed a next wave of bottom-up initiatives that respond to the ongoing dynamics and challenges in the global economy. Attendees included city and regional leaders representing nearly 40 metro areas from around the globe, as well as participants from national and international business and trade promotion groups, federal agencies and economic development organizations. The Summit featured the release of new Brookings research Redefining Global Cities: The Seven Types of Global Metro Economies, which introduces a new typology of what constitutes global cities today, demonstrating how global cities vary in how they attract and amass economic drivers and contribute differently to global economic growth. It also launched The Making of Global Cities: Stories from the Global Cities Exchange, a ‘compendium’ of stories and examples from metropolitan areas advancing global trade and investment strategies through the Global Cities Exchange.

Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said. “There’s no reason” the bank can’t resolve issues including settlement talks with the U.S. Department of Justice over the sale of residential mortgage-backed securities, Dimon said Tuesday in a phone interview with CNBC, adding the problems were largely created by government. Dimon also defended Wells Fargo & Co. CEO John Stumpf, who’s under pressure over an unauthorized-account scandal at his San Francisco-based bank. Stumpf is “a quality human being,” Dimon said in the interview, which focused mostly on JPMorgan’s efforts to help revitalize Detroit. Deutsche Bank’s stock and debt have been under pressure since the Justice Department requested $14 billion to settle the mortgage probe. CEO John Cryan has said he doesn’t plan to raise capital and expects U.S. authorities to scale back their request to bring it in line with previous settlements. The shares rose 1.8 percent to 11.78 euros at 9:19 a.m. in Frankfurt. They have declined about 48 percent this year, while the Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services Index fell 23 percent.

Share:  Email    Link Here        Facebook        Twitter        LinkedIn        Google Plus Widgets by: Rob Chrisman Lawsuits and Settlements; Attorney's Input on Cyber-Security and Servicing Oct 3 2016, 8:49AM Welcome to the first business day of the 4th quarter! For another first, on this date in 1955 the first episode of Captain Kangaroo aired. Just think of how many people in our biz watched that series when they were kids! Heavens to Murgatroyd! (Yes, I know, different show.) Although not related to mortgages, but more to "when it rains it pours," last week the DOJ and OCC announced separate settlement agreements with Wells Fargo regarding alleged violations of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA). The DOJ's complaint alleged that the bank repossessed vehicles owned by active duty service members without the required court orders. Under the DOJ consent order, the bank agreed to pay $10,000 to each affected service members whose vehicles were repossessed between from January 2008 to July 2015 not in compliance with SCRA, plus any lost equity in the repossessed vehicle, with interest. The DOJ identified 413 affected service members and the bank agreed to set aside $4,130,000 (or more if needed) to pay the required compensation. On the mortgage side, a federal judge has thrown out FDIC lawsuits against Citigroup Inc, Bank of New York Mellon Corp and U.S. Bancorp to recoup some of the more than $695 million that the regulator said it lost by selling soured mortgage debt once owned by Texas' Guaranty Bank. (Guaranty Bank failed.) From New York word came that U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter said the FDIC, the receiver for Austin-based Guaranty Bank, lacked standing to sue after selling the debt in question through a March 2010 resecuritization transaction. "Any claims that plaintiff might have held, travelled with the bonds when they were transferred," Carter wrote. The FDIC had argued that the right to sue was a "personal" claim that it did not give away in the resecuritization. The FDIC had accused the defendant banks of failing, in their roles as bond trustees, to ensure that mortgages backing $2.7 billion of securities bought by Guaranty were properly underwritten, or to require lenders to fix or buy back troubled loans. The securities were issued from 2005 to 2007, and sponsored by EMC (Bear Stearns) or by Countrywide. (As a reminder for anyone who wasn't in the residential lending business before 2009, in 2008 JPMorgan Chase bought Bear Stearns, and thus EMC, and Bank of America bought Countrywide.) Senior Deutsche Bank officials are expected in the U.S. this week to negotiate a settlement with the Department of Justice over a $14 billion fine for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities. Reports suggest that American authorities are considering cutting the penalty to $5.4 billion. Addressing the current legal environment for cyber-security and servicing, Anthony Sharett, Partner, National Co-Chair Financial Services Industry Group with BakerHostetler, writes, "Lenders need to be aware of consumer suits facing lenders and servicers under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, TCPA, and other consumer statutes. For example, we now know that in the cyber-security area, the Sixth and Seventh Circuits have held that plaintiffs have standing to sue due to an 'increased risk' of future identity theft resulting from a data breach. The Third Circuit, however, previously determined that plaintiffs have no standing to sue based on an 'increased risk' of future identity theft explaining that reason alone is too speculative to establish standing. "Mortgage servicers are seeing increased litigation under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) as plaintiff's lawyers are bringing more nuanced claims concerning how servicers are reporting certain borrower activity to credit reporting agencies, particularly where there is a bankruptcy involved. Yesterday, in a 6-2 decision, the Supreme Court of the United States issued its decision in Robins v. Spokeo, No. 13-1339, 578 U. S. ____ (2016), putting to rest months of speculation as to whether the Court could come to a meaningful decision (that would be anything other than 4-4) in the aftermath of Justice Scalia's passing in February. In a ruling that both defense and plaintiffs' lawyers alike are heralding as a victory, the Court held that to satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement to bring a lawsuit under the FCRA, the plaintiff must allege an injury that is both "concrete and particularized."  With that, the Court vacated the Ninth Circuit decision and remanded the case to the trial court to consider both aspects of the injury-in-fact requirement.   "In practical terms, the Supreme Court decision means that a consumer cannot sue companies, including mortgage lenders and servicers, under the FCRA for mere technical violations of the law.  This decision could curtail individual litigation against mortgage lenders and servicers under the FCRA and reduce class action litigation. But while creditors and lenders may celebrate this decision, so are plaintiff's lawyers and consumer advocates. As Justice Alito stated, 'the violation of a procedural right granted by statute can be sufficient in some circumstances to constitute injury-in-fact,' Justice Alito wrote. 'In other words, a plaintiff in such a case need not allege any additional harm beyond the one Congress has identified.' It remains to be seen how this ruling may impact litigation involving other consumer statutes such as the TCPA. Finally, the cybersecurity community was closing watching the Spokeo decision because in cybersecurity cases, 'concrete injury' rarely is addressed and the courts have been divided on standing.  "Thus, the post-Spokeo landscape is still evolving and, in the future, the U.S. Supreme Court could clarify Spokeo particularly in the cyber-security area (an increasing risk area for lenders, servicers and vendors). Finally, consider how all of this will impact compliance measures under the new HMDA rules and data reporting requirements." Thank you Anthony! Are consumers involved with these legal matters, or insurance claims? Sure they are. Lenders must incur costs for "lawyering up," and these costs are passed on to borrowers. On the insurance claim side of things, personal finance reporter Daniel Goldstein did a write up titled, "Why Hermine may make it tough for homeowners to get insurance repair checks." (One hopes that the mortgage servicers get it right this time and have people on site in Louisiana who can co-sign insurance checks.) In response to Hurricane Hermine in Florida and in response to a Federal Disaster Declaration, M&T Bank will enforce the Disaster Reinspection Policy for all properties located in the affected parishes in the following designated areas: Counties of Citrus, Dixie, Hernando, Hillsborough, Leon, Levy, Pasco, Pinellas. Re-inspection policies remain in effect per M&T's matrix. Applicable dates refer to Appraisals Completed prior to 9-11-2016. In reference to the FEMA announced assistance granted to 8 Florida counties to supplement individual, state, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by Hurricane Hermine from 8/31-9/11/2016; AmeriHome's Seller Guide Section 10.10 covers its Disaster Policy for property inspection requirements. Re-inspection requirements are expected to remain in place for all properties with appraisal dates prior to the incident end date or for at least 90 days following the incident end date for loan transactions where an appraisal inspection is not otherwise required, unless otherwise announced by AmeriHome.  the area covered by the declaration, if a Seller has reason to believe that a property might have been damaged in a disaster the Seller must take appropriate action to ensure that the property is free from damage and meets AmeriHome requirements at the time of purchase by AmeriHome. Employment re-verification requirements for declared disaster areas are not necessary at this time.   Turning to the bond markets, can you believe we're starting the 4th quarter of the year? Rates are steady, which is fine by many. Looking back to Friday we saw a little intra-day volatility in the bond market due to Deutsche Bank news (of a potentially smaller settlement). The usual sellers are selling, although many are reporting lighter lock volumes, and the usual buyers are buying, most notably the Fed to the tune of $1-2.5 billion a day of various securities and coupons. For now, the talk of the NY Fed ceasing purchasing agency MBS has stopped - but it is always in the back of our minds. Friday the 10-year note price worsened nearly .5 and it closed with a yield of 1.61%. Agency MBS prices and the 5-year T-note ended the day worse about .125. Jobs and housing move the economy, and this week it's a job data week. Scheduled news includes today's Markit US Manufacturing PMI, Construction Spending, car sales and a block of the Institute of Supply Management figures - none big market movers. Tomorrow is zip, but Wednesday the 5th things pick up with the MBA's application data for last week, the ADP Employment Change numbers, trade balance, Factory Orders, and Durable Goods - a big morning! Thursday we'll see Initial Jobless Claims and Challenger Job Cuts. Friday we have the whole set of employment data including Non-Farm Payroll, Hourly Earnings, and the Unemployment Rate. In the early going the 10-year is hovering around a 1.60% yield and agency MBS prices are roughly unchanged from Friday afternoon.

Systemic Risk: Deutsche Bank #1 at $100 Billion (BNP Paribas 2nd, Societe Generale 3rd) By: Mike Shedlock | Mon, Oct 3, 2016 Share Print Email Inquiring minds may be interested in a cornucopia of relevant numbers on Deutsche Bank including market cap, leverage, capitalization, deposits, liquidity, derivatives multiple ways, and systemic risk. Systemic risk numbers are from Nobel Laureate Robert Engle. Deutsche Bank by the Numbers Systemic Risk: $100 billion (see explanation and chart below) Notional derivatives: €42 trillion, an amount about the size of the German economy Market value of Derivatives: €18 billion Equity: €67 billion Assets: €1.6 trillion Leverage Ratio: 25-1 Level 3 assets: (Illiquid potentially mark-to fantasy assets) €32 billion Outstanding Fines: €12.47 billion ($14 billion) Ready liquidity: €220 billion Investment bank employees: (Risk takers – M.R.Ts in EU regulatory circles) 1,871 MRT salaries: €2 billion Market Cap: €16.2 billion All numbers except market cap from Deutsche Bank's Appetite for Risk Throws Off Its Balance. Here are some interesting snips, interspersed with my comments in brackets. More than eight years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers sent shock waves around the world, the fear is whether Deutsche Bank and its highly leveraged balance sheet of 1.6 trillion euros might teeter and set off another bout of financial contagion. Those worries calmed down somewhat late last week as Deutsche Bank's shares rose after reports that the bank may be close to cutting a deal with the United States Justice Department regarding the fine it must pay for selling toxic mortgages during the financial crisis. [Those are unsubstantiated rumors. Recent reports suggest there is no settlement in progress.] There has also been a growing realization that Deutsche Bank, even with its thin cushion of cash, is in much better financial shape than Lehman Brothers was. In a letter to employees on Friday, Deutsche's chief executive, John Cryan, highlighted the "strong fundamentals" of the bank. [BS by Cryan hardly constitutes a growing realization of anything. Shares had a one day bounce based on a rumor that as of now appears false.] It has €220 billion, or $247 billion, in ready liquidity, compared with $45 billion for Lehman in 2007, and the bank can also tap central banks in the United States and in Europe for a financial lifeline if need be. [Won't that be fun?] "What makes Deutsche Bank systemic is their sheer size combined with the leverage that is required to stay in the flow and be an intermediary," said Anthony J. Perrotta Jr., an expert in the structure of financial markets at TABB Group, a consulting firm. "But as capital becomes more scarce, this becomes a fragile equation." Deutsche Bank has €67 billion ($75 billion) in equity that supports assets of €1.6 trillion ($1.8 trillion), which mean it is levered at a ratio of 25 to 1. By comparison, JPMorgan has $224 billion in cash backing $2.4 trillion in assets, which produces a far healthier ratio of 9 to 1. Making Deutsche Bank's ratio more troubling is that many of these assets are of the most illiquid variety, called Level 3 securities, for which establishing a price is guesswork and finding a buyer near impossible. Stuart Graham, a banking analyst with Autonomous Research in London, says that Deutsche Bank has more high-paid risk takers than any other bank — including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse. Most analysts believe that Deutsche Bank needs to raise an extra €5 billion to €7 billion from investors in order to calm concerns about its financial health, especially in light of the fact that the Justice Department may require the firm to pay a penalty of at least this amount. [€7 billion will not do squat. Where did they dream up that number? Add €7 billion to equity and you have €74 billion in equity vs. €1.6 trillion in assets of which €32 billion are level-3 assets likely marked to fantasy. Anyway, another €7 billion would bring the leverage ratio down to a bit under 23-1.] $100 Billion Undercapitalized? Robert Engle, an economist at New York University who was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work on volatility and capital markets, has designed a model that ranks financial institutions in terms of their systemic risk. The barometer takes into consideration leverage, the bank's stock price and its equity base, and as such it represents a real-time measure of the dangers a bank poses to the financial system at a given moment in time. Global regulators use it as well to complement their own internal models. As of now, Deutsche Bank is ranked at the top  among European banks in terms of risk, requiring close to €100 billion in fresh cash to ensure that it could survive a sustained sell-off in the markets. German Economy Minister Blasts Deutsche Bank On Sunday, Sigmar Gabriel, the German Economy Minister Accused Deutsche Bank of Making Speculation its Business. "I did not know if I should laugh or cry that the bank that made speculation a business model is now saying it is a victim of speculators," Gabriel told reporters. Systemic Risk "There is just a lot of risk for Deutsche Bank right now," Mr. Engle said. "We have been worried about European banks for quite a while."

The report says J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Chicago-based Nuveen Asset Management have made and realized paper profits exceeding $110 million on purchases this year of $763 million in Chicago Public School bonds. The school system has said it needed the money to replenish its dwindling coffers before the new school year and to build and repair facilities. The terms of the bond sales highlight the choices the school district faces after years of pension shortfalls and relying heavily on borrowing. A J.P. Morgan spokeswoman says the bank views the school board as a high-priority client that it understands well and is willing to support its short- and long-term capital needs.

The German lender is throwing its energies into reaching a settlement before next month's U.S. presidential election, with the Department of Justice demanding a fine of up to $14 billion for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities. Its shares didn't trade in Germany on Monday because of a public holiday, but its U.S.-listed stock was down around 2.8 percent at mid-morning. The threat of such a large fine has pushed Deutsche shares to record lows, and a cut-price settlement is urgently needed to help restore confidence in Germany's largest lender. A media report late on Friday that Deutsche and the DOJ were close to agreeing a much lower penalty of $5.4 billion lifted the stock 6 percent higher, but on Monday that report remained unconfirmed. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that the bank's talks with the DOJ were continuing. Details are in flux, with no deal yet presented to senior decision makers for approval on either side, the paper said, citing people familiar with the matter. "Clearly, so long as a fine of this order of magnitude ($14 billion) is an even remote possibility, markets worry," UniCredit Chief Economist Erik F. Nielsen wrote in a note on Sunday. Ratings agency Moody's said it would be positive for bondholders if the lender could settle for around $3.1 billion, while a fine as high as $5.7 billion would dent 2016 profitability but not significantly impair the bank's capital position. POTENTIAL RISK Deutsche is much smaller than Wall Street rivals such as JPMorgan and Citigroup. But it has significant trading relationships with all of the world's largest finance houses and the International Monetary Fund this year identified it as a bigger potential risk to the wider financial system than any other global bank. Deutsche Chief Executive John Cryan will be in Washington this week for the annual meeting of the IMF, and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported that other executives would join him to try to negotiate a settlement with the U.S. authorities. Like fellow large European banks also under investigation for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities - Credit Suisse and Barclays - Deutsche will want to get a deal done with the current administration still in power. A new administration to be installed after the Nov. 8 election will bring unknown risks and likely delays. Domestically, Deutsche Bank is fighting a rearguard action, seeking to shore up confidence among the public, politicians and regulators who say the bank brought many of its problems upon itself by overreaching itself and then reacting too slowly to the 2008 financial crisis. It suffered a further blow to its image this weekend with a third IT outage in the space of a few months on Saturday, denying some customers access to their money for a short time. INDUSTRY SUPPORT German business leaders from companies including BASF , Daimler, E.ON, RWE and Siemens lined up to defend the bank in a front-page article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung. "German industry needs a Deutsche Bank to accompany us out into the world," BASF Chairman Juergen Hambrecht said. A spokesman for a blue-chip company that did not feature in the article told Reuters he had been asked by Deutsche for an executive to provide a similar supportive comment. Deutsche Bank and the government in Berlin have had to play a delicate balancing act, emphasising the substance and importance of the bank without implying any need for state aid or willingness to supply it. The bank has a market capitalisation of only about 15.9 billion euros ($17.9 billion) and would almost certainly have to raise fresh cash to pay the full DOJ demand. Both the bank and Berlin this week denied reports that the government was preparing a rescue plan. The Bild am Sonntag newspaper wrote on Sunday that Deutsche's chairman had informed Berlin just before it disclosed the potential $14 billion fine but had not asked for help. The same newspaper quoted the president of the Bavarian Finance Centre, Wolfgang Gerke, as saying that the German government should step in and buy a 20 percent stake in the bank before its value fell any further. The group represents financial services companies in the southern German state. "Fundamentally, I'm against state interventions," he told the newspaper, but added that in this case a government stake would be "a signal that could turn the whole market".

Deutsche Bank CEO John Cryan's opening line in his letter to employees last week pinned some of the blame for lender's share price plummet on "speculation in the media" that some hedge fund clients had reduced business with the German lender. Cryan was referring to prime brokerage activities, wherein banks provide a bundled and tailored package of services to hedge funds, such as securities lending or cash management. One hedge fund professional who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of business relations told CNBC over the phone that the larger hedge funds named in the press as having withdrawn business, likely had enough negotiating leverage to return to Deutsche Bank before long if they wished. This contrasts with the experience of smaller hedge funds who are finding it increasingly difficult to engage a prime broker at all, with another manager, who also asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of business relations, telling CNBC that unless funds were able to raise a significant amount of capital themselves – around $250 million – and demonstrate that they have the potential and capacity to generate significant trades, their business is increasingly unwanted by the larger service providers. Given a recent wave of consolidation in the prime brokerage industry on the back of a wave of new regulatory obligations and a reassessment of profitability potential, the number of top-notch prime brokerage providers for hedge funds to approach has dwindled. For example, RBS and Nomura shuttered some of their operations in recent years while UBS has restructured towards a more balance sheet-light model. The result is a shrinking core of leading prime brokers, which now includes Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan on the equities side and Citi, JPMorgan and Barclays on the FX side. Another manager told CNBC anonymously, again because of the sensitivity of the business, that whereas smaller funds used to have the luxury of multiple prime brokers, now they generally had only one, thereby reducing their ability to extract bargaining leverage or potentially switch up service providers as seamlessly as done by several of Deutsche Bank's larger hedge fund clients last week. Press reports have intimated liquidity concerns were instrumental in driving the estimated 10 hedge fund clients to withdraw business from Deutsche Bank. The creditworthiness consideration has been of even greater concern for hedge funds given events following Lehman Brothers' collapse, when some funds that were prime brokerage clients of the fallen investment bank had their assets frozen until legal complications were resolved. In the more extreme cases, certain funds were only re-granted access to their assets recently despite Lehman Brothers' demise now occurring over eight years ago. Frozen assets raise the issue of how to value them until they are released as well as spurring untimely de-leveraging by funds suddenly forced to hold large cash balances. It also raises the dire potential for jittery investors to call for their funds if there is a sizeable paper loss, forcing a possible firesale of other assets. While a large and liquid fund has a greater chance of withstanding an asset freeze, a smaller fund with less of a funding buffer can be more susceptible to buckling under such strain. In a climate where smaller hedge funds are already disproportionately burdened by the additional cost and time implications of regulatory initiatives, the incremental difficulties resulting from an increasingly hard to access prime brokerage industry are certain to be unwelcome for these managers.

Published: 15:16 October 3, 2016 Reuters   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE FRANKFURT: Deutsche Bank is throwing its energies into reaching a settlement before next month’s presidential election with US authorities demanding a fine of up to $14 billion (Dh51.4 billion) for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities. The threat of such a large fine has pushed Deutsche shares to record lows, and a cut-price settlement is urgently needed to reverse the trend and help to restore confidence in Germany’s largest lender. Its shares won’t trade in Germany on Monday because of a public holiday, but they will resume trading on the US market later on Monday. A media report late on Friday that Deutsche and the US Department of Justice were close to agreeing on a settlement of $5.4 billion lifted the stock 6 percent higher, but that report has not been confirmed. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that the bank’s talks with the DOJ were continuing. Details are in flux, with no deal yet presented to senior decision makers for approval on either side, the paper said, citing people familiar with the matter. “Clearly, so long as a fine of this order of magnitude ($14 billion) is an even remote possibility, markets worry,” UniCredit Chief Economist Erik F. Nielsen wrote in a note on Sunday. Ratings agency Moody’s said it would be positive for bondholders if the lender could settle for around $3.1 billion, while a fine as high as $5.7 billion would dent 2016 profitability but not significantly impair the bank’s capital position. Deutsche is much smaller than Wall Street rivals such as JPMorgan and Citigroup. But it has significant trading relationships with all of the world’s largest finance houses and the International Monetary Fund this year identified it as a bigger potential risk to the wider financial system than any other global bank. Deutsche Chief Executive John Cryan will be in Washington this week for the annual meeting of the IMF, and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported that other executives would join him to try to negotiate a settlement with the US authorities. Like fellow large European banks also under investigation for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities — Credit Suisse and Barclays — Deutsche will want to get a deal done with the current administration still in power. A new administration to be installed after the November 8 election will bring unknown risks and likely delays. Domestically, Deutsche Bank is fighting a rearguard action, seeking to shore up confidence among the public, politicians and regulators who say the bank brought many of its problems upon itself by overreaching itself and then reacting too slowly to the 2008 financial crisis. It suffered a further blow to its image this weekend with a third IT outage in the space of a few months on Saturday, denying some customers access to their money for a short time. German business leaders from companies including BASF, Daimler, E.ON, RWE and Siemens lined up to defend the bank in a front-page article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung. “German industry needs a Deutsche Bank to accompany us out into the world,” BASF Chairman Juergen Hambrecht said. A spokesman for a blue-chip company that did not feature in the article told Reuters he had been asked by Deutsche for an executive to provide a similar supportive comment. Deutsche Bank and the government in Berlin have had to play a delicate balancing act, emphasising the substance and importance of the bank without implying any need for state aid or willingness to supply it. The bank has a market capitalisation of only about 15.9 billion euros ($17.9 billion) and would almost certainly have to raise fresh cash to pay the full DOJ demand. Both the bank and Berlin this week denied reports that the government was preparing a rescue plan.   BOX - Deutsche Bank said set to advance on 1,000 planned job cuts London, Zurich: Deutsche Bank AG is poised to reach an agreement with labour representatives this week that will pave the way for the German lender to eliminate about 1,000 jobs in its home market as part of Chief Executive Officer John Cryan’s cost cuts announced last year, said people with knowledge of the matter. The planned job cuts, which need to be signed off by the works council, will mostly affect back-office staff such as in information technology services, said the people, who asked not to be identified because negotiations are private. The Frankfurt-based lender in June struck an agreement with its works council to eliminate about 3,000 full-time positions, including 2,500 jobs at its private and commercial clients business. As part of his overhaul announced in October 2015, the CEO plans to eliminate 9,000 jobs, or about 9 per cent of the global workforce, including 4,000 positions in Germany. -Bloomberg More from Banking Citigroup ready to face any outcome of Brexit 02:33 pm Fawaz Alhokair close to loan for Arab Bank stake 04:57 pm Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia’s currency move Deutsche Bank to claw back bonuses from ex-CEOs US settlement is blocking RBS share sale Julius Baer banks on new hires to spur growth Swiss banks seek heirs to millions Abu Dhabi said to mull more bank mergers tags from this storyBarclays follow this tag on MGNUnited States follow this tag on MGNInternational Monetary Fund follow this tag on MGNGermany follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessSectorsBanking tagsBarclays follow this tag on MGN+ MGNUnited States follow this tag on MGN+ MGNInternational Monetary Fund follow this tag on MGN+ MGNGermany follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In BankingCitigroup ready to face any outcome of Brexit Business Gallery Kish island turns to be a major tourism hub Pakistan, China launch new trade route Business Videos PlayStrata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosGalleries 01Gulf banks could lose access to dollar clearing 02Abu Dhabi said to mull more bank mergers 03Barclays taps into opportunities in the region Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens Oct 01, 2016 Play Emirates Group announces record profits May 10, 2016 Play Emirati who created 2 successful companies Jan 02, 2016 1Image In pictures: Evolution of Emirates airline Oct 25, 2015 10Images Apple unveils Nike+ smartwatch Oct 29, 2016 8Images Where to live in Downtown Dubai Mar 15, 2011 11Images Highlights: Japan Aerospace 2016 air show Oct 13, 2016 company stock update 1d1 Wk1Mth1Qtr1Yr5Yr Gulf News Business on Twitter Tweets by @GulfNewsBiz Follow @GulfNewsBiz on Twitter Most Popular on Gulf News UAE announces public, private sector holidays Jailed, abused, and homeless Viral: Saudi man’s love poem to Ivanka Trump 'Utter devastation' after New Zealand quakes Data of 34 million Keralites leaked Your guide to tonight’s Supermoon Indian embassy to take up expats’ rupee concerns Best airlines to fly with in 2017 Gold posts biggest price drop in months Close Recommended For You Barclays’ CEO sees ‘pressure’ on FedPUBLISHED ON Nov 16, 2016 Tahlak promises ‘Grand Slam-like’ field in 2017PUBLISHED ON Nov 16, 2016 Woman weds boyfriend in husband’s presencePUBLISHED ON Nov 18, 2016 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.
