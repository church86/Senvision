(Reuters) EU antitrust regulators are set to fine Europe’s biggest bank HSBC, JPMorgan and Credit Agricole by the end of the year for rigging financial benchmarks linked to the euro, two people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Charges were levied in May 2014 against the three banks, which denied wrongdoing. The European Commission could penalise HSBC, JPMorgan and Credit Agricole next month, the people said. The decision has been delayed several times and another hold-up could still occur. European Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso declined to comment. The EU competition enforcer can levy fines up to 10 percent of a company’s global turnover for breaching the bloc’s rules. JPMorgan said the EU charges were without merit when it was served the document and that it would defend itself. Credit Agricole has said it would examine the charge sheet. HSBC said at that time that it would defend itself vigorously. Deutsche Bank, RBS and Societe Generale admitted guilt in December 2013. Barclays avoided a fine because it alerted the Commission. U.S. and European regulators have so far handed down billion-dollar fines to more than 10 banks and brokerages for rigging the London interbank offered rate (Libor) and its euro cousin Euribor. Prosecutors have also charged more than a dozen men with fraud-related offences. Please Wait while comments are loading...

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Nov 15, 2016 at 4:06PM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. The more I dig into the impact of the presidential election on banks, the more it seems like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) will benefit tremendously under a Donald Trump presidency. One of the biggest ways the North Carolina-based bank could gain is from a loosening of regulations around capital distributions -- dividends and share buybacks. Regulatory oversight of capital plans Current regulations give the Federal Reserve the authority to veto a bank's decision to increase its dividend or buy back stock. The Fed hasn't been shy about using this power either. In 2011, it denied Bank of America's request to boost its dividend for the first time since the financial crisis. The following year, Bank of America didn't even ask to do so. The net result is that Bank of America has only increased its dividend twice over the past eight years. It boosted its then nominal $0.01 per-share payout in 2014 to $0.05 per share. And it did so again this year, raising its quarterly distribution by an additional 50%, to $0.075 per share. BAC Dividend data by YCharts. This stands in stark contrast to many of Bank of America's closest competitors, banks like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). JPMorgan Chase has raised its dividend every year since 2011. The nation's largest bank by assets now pays out more per share than it did before the financial crisis. JPMorgan Chase's current dividend is $0.48 per share. And the story is the same for Wells Fargo. Just like JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo has boosted its quarterly payout in each of the past six years. Wells Fargo now distributes $0.38 per share each quarter. The net result is that, from the perspective of income investors, Bank of America has been left in the dust by Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase. Likely regulatory changes Under a Trump administration, the playing field could soon be leveled for Bank of America. One of Trump's signature policy proposals is to roll back significant portions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which was passed in the wake of the financial crisis and vests the authority to stress test banks in the Federal Reserve. And while it's too early to know exactly what these changes will entail, there's reason to believe that they'll eliminate the Fed's authority to deny bank capital plans. You can get a sense for this by looking at the so-called Financial CHOICE Act, proposed by Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling, who's purportedly being considered by Trump for Treasury Secretary. Among other things, the CHOICE Act would no longer allow the Fed to deny a bank's capital plans if it maintains a leverage ratio of at least 10% -- meaning that its assets are no more than 10 times its tangible equity. It's no exaggeration to think that this could translate into a dramatically higher dividend for Bank of America's shareholders. This follows from the fact that Bank of America distributes half as much of its earnings each year when compared to JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. Bank of America's payout ratio is currently 16%, while JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo's are each above 30%. It remains to be seen what path Trump's administration will take when it comes to financial reform. However, if there's any truth to the rumors that the incoming president could use Hensarling's approach as a guidepost, then Bank of America's shareholders may soon be on the receiving end of a much bigger quarterly dividend.

(Reuters/Stephen Lam) Share Written by Alison Griswold Obsession Getting There November 15, 2016 We may have already reached peak “sharing” economy. Average monthly earnings on “labor” platforms such as Uber, which use technology to match workers (like drivers) to people who need a service (like riders), peaked in June 2014, according to new data from the JPMorgan Chase Institute, the research arm of JPMorgan Chase. On “capital” platforms such as Airbnb, which help people rent out assets like a car or spare room, the share of US adults participating has declined from the previous year. On both types of online platforms, wages are growing more slowly as is overall participation. And retention is awful: 52% of people working for labor platforms quit within a year, and 56% of those on capital platforms vacate in the first 12 months. Participation in the “sharing” or “gig” economy was once touted as the future of work in America. But the new data from the JPMorgan Chase Institute suggests that isn’t the case. Instead, wages for workers have gotten worse as many of these companies—Uber and Lyft, to pick two examples—have cut pay rates to make prices more attractive to consumers. And the jobs themselves appear to have served as stop-gap measures for people who were unemployed or had fallen on hard times during and after the recession. As the US economy has improved—with six years of unbroken job growth and even an uptick in wages—a greater share of those gig participants are finding better jobs. So they’ve stopped or cut down on their Uber and related gig work. “It doesn’t look like [gig work] is becoming more lucrative for people,” says Fiona Greig, co-author on the JPMorgan Chase Institute report. “As the labor force strengthens in general, more and more people have better options.” Jobs on these online platforms were always tenuous. “Labor” companies like Uber, Lyft, and TaskRabbit have made a practice of hiring their workers as independent contractors rather than employees. The setup means workers get more flexibility—setting your own schedule is a big talking point—but don’t get benefits such as health care, a guaranteed minimum wage, and other protections offered by full-time employment in America. Previous work from the JPMorgan Chase Institute found that the people working for companies such as Uber were typically doing so to offset shortfalls in their monthly earnings. The poorer those workers were, the more they also depended on their gig income. People in more stable financial situations, however, are more likely to quit gig work altogether. According to the JPMorgan Chase Institute, 56% of people employed somewhere other than an online labor platform drop out within 12 months. For those whose only work is on online labor platforms, that figure falls to 37%. Similarly, people with higher incomes are more likely to cease working for companies like Uber. None of this is great news for investors or managers of sharing economy startups. The retention figures should alarm startups that spent heavily to build up legions of independent contractors, then struggled to keep those people sticking around. In early 2015, a paper from influential labor economist Alan Krueger found that only about 55% of Uber drivers remained active one year after starting. That metric appears to be getting worse, not better. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

By Saleha Mohsin, Kevin Cirilli and Jennifer Jacobs Bloomberg News  November 15, 2016 Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner Steven Mnuchin has been recommended by Donald Trump’s transition team to serve as Treasury secretary, according to two people familiar with the process, and the choice is awaiting the president-elect’s final decision. Mnuchin, the campaign’s national finance chairman, has been considered the leading candidate for the job. Trump has displayed a pattern of loyalty to his closest campaign allies in early administration selections, and Mnuchin, 53, had signed on at a time when many from Wall Street stayed away. Advertisement Before joining Trump, Mnuchin rose through the kind of elite institutions the president-elect spent his campaign vilifying. Mnuchin was tapped into Yale’s Skull and Bones secret society, became a Goldman Sachs partner like his father before him, ran a hedge fund, worked with George Soros, funded Hollywood blockbusters and bought a failed bank, IndyMac, with billionaires including John Paulson. They renamed it OneWest, drew protests for foreclosing on U.S. borrowers, and ultimately generated considerable profits, selling the business last year to CIT Group Inc. for $3.4 billion. Mnuchin, who co-founded hedge fund Dune Capital Management LP, was seen at Trump Tower on Monday. Asked by reporters why he was there, he said, “I’m here just helping with the transition this week. A lot of work to do.” He had no immediate comment when reached about the Treasury post.

Sign up for more newsletters here The transition team also was said to be considering investor Wilbur Ross Jr., Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon. Ross didn’t respond to requests for comment. Hensarling said last week he would “certainly have the discussion” if Trump’s administration called, but that he isn’t pursuing the post. A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment. Trump hasn’t yet made a final decision. Mnuchin would become the third former Goldman Sachs executive to head the Treasury since the mid-1990s. Robert Rubin and Hank Paulson both ran the Wall Street firm before becoming Treasury chiefs under presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, respectively. Advertisement It’s a longstanding pattern that has earned Goldman the nickname “Government Sachs,” and it currently extends to the Federal Reserve and abroad. New York Fed President William Dudley is the firm’s former chief U.S. economist. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney was a managing director at the firm. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi was vice chairman of its international arm. ‘Smart Guy’ On Sunday, Trump named another Goldman alumnus, the former Breitbart News chief Steve Bannon, to one of his top posts in his White House, chief strategist and senior counselor. Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein praised Mnuchin at a conference in New York last week as a “very smart guy,” who rose quickly within the firm. “I have followed his career, and I know what he has done, but I haven’t engaged with him much since then,” Blankfein said. The company’s stock has climbed 15 percent since the Nov. 8 election. The next Treasury chief’s challenges will include a budget deficit that’s forecast to widen and require increased debt issuance; an economy that’s been stuck in a period of slow growth and exacerbated income inequality; and international partners wary about the new president’s approach to trade. During the campaign, the real estate mogul indicated that among his first moves will be a Treasury designation naming China a currency manipulator. Joining the campaign this year, Mnuchin was charged with a seemingly insurmountable task: Go up against the Hillary Clinton money machine that was out-organizing and out-raising Trump. The campaign had no organized fundraising operation because Trump relied mostly on his own money to get through the primaries. So Mnuchin essentially outsourced much of the work to others. He relied heavily on the Republican National Committee’s digital and direct-mail expertise to amass small-dollar donations. And a group of former RNC bigwigs helped form the core of a new Trump network to gather big checks at dinners where seats could cost $50,000 or more. Ultimately, Mnuchin’s role was less rainmaker and more chief financial officer: He weighed in on schedules and venues, proofread fundraising e-mails, rearranged chairs at dinners, and even helped set up the process that Trump Tower campaign staff used to open the mail. Tax Breaks He also took particular interest in tax policy. He argued that Trump’s tax plan should cut the top marginal rate to 33 percent, prevailing over other Trump advisers who had advocated for even lower figures, he said in an interview in August.  “He made the case this would be politically problematic,” said Stephen Moore, another Trump policy adviser, in a separate August interview. “That Trump would get skewered if it were perceived as a big tax cut for the rich.” By cutting the top rate from 39.6 percent, the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center estimates that almost half of the benefits of the Trump tax cut would fall to the top 1 percent of U.S. earners. If Mnuchin is confirmed for the Treasury role, it could save him millions in taxes. A 1989 rule allows him to sell stock tax-free if he reinvests the proceeds in Treasuries or in government-approved funds. The loophole was designed for executives who need to sell shares to comply with conflict-of-interest rules. Paulson’s Savings Mnuchin owns $97 million of CIT Group, according to a February ownership filing, the latest available. Because he received most of those shares when CIT purchased OneWest Bank in 2015, the exact cost basis that would be used to calculate his taxes isn’t immediately clear. Previous Treasury secretaries have taken advantage of the rule. Hank Paulson was eligible to save about $48 million on roughly $495 million of Goldman Sachs shares when he was nominated to run the department in 2006, the New York Times reportedat the time. Trump’s transition team signaled last week that it wants to dismantle key parts of the Dodd-Frank Act, the sweeping overhaul of U.S. financial regulation aimed at preventing future crises. Asked about the 2010 law before the election, Mnuchin said there are good and bad things about it, without elaborating. Goldman Experience Mnuchin started his career in the early 1980s as a trainee at Salomon Brothers. He went on to spend 17 years at Goldman Sachs, where a mentor showed him how the firm could profit from the savings-and-loan crisis of the 1980s, buying up assets cheap. Mnuchin oversaw mortgage-backed-bond trading at Goldman before becoming the investment bank’s chief information officer in 1999. He left in 2002 and two years later founded Dune Capital, named for a spot near his house in the Hamptons. The 2008 financial crisis lured Mnuchin back into banking. That summer, he was in his New York office when he saw a TV news shot of customers lined up outside a branch of IndyMac, a California lender, trying to pull out their money. “This bank is going to end up failing, and we need to figure out how to buy it,” he told a colleague, recalling the lessons of the savings and loan crisis. “I’ve seen this game before.” The bank collapsed that July, just months before Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s failure set off a global emergency. At one of the murkiest moments of the crisis, Mnuchin gathered investors for a $1.6 billion bid to buy IndyMac. He got an agreement that guaranteed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. would absorb almost all the loan losses after a certain threshold. He renamed the bank OneWest. Within a year, it was profitable. ‘Foreclosure Machine’ In October 2011 about 100 protesters marched on his Los Angeles mansion, angry about foreclosures. “Steve Mnuchin,” one sign read, “Stop taking our homes.” He and his partners completed the bank’s sale in August 2015. California Reinvestment Coalition deputy director Kevin Stein, whose group has accused OneWest of particularly aggressive foreclosure practices, criticized Mnuchin’s legacy on Monday. “Mr. Mnuchin oversaw a foreclosure machine,” Stein said in an e-mail. Taking the brunt were “working-class families, communities of color and seniors.” Loading comments...

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Nov 14, 2016 at 4:46PM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. News that Donald Trump won the presidential election last week has sent bank stocks surging across the board, with the KBW Bank Index up nearly 13% since last Tuesday's close. But even though this performance has been broad-based, few banks stand to gain as much from a Trump presidency as Citigroup (NYSE:C). Short- vs. long-term benefits to Citigroup If you've been following Citigroup's stock performance over the past week, this may surprise you. I say that because shares of the nation's fourth biggest bank by assets are lagging those of its peers. While the KBW Bank Index is up almost 13% since last Tuesday, Citigroup's stock is up only 9%. Before its shareholders get disappointed, though, it's worth pointing out that the New York-based bank is still creaming the broader market, which is up only 1% over the same stretch. KBWB data by YCharts. But just because Citigroup has lagged its big-bank peers since the election results were announced doesn't mean it will continue to underperform them. In fact, I think there are reasons to believe it will more than make up for the difference over the next year. Why Citigroup has so much to gain Over the long run, Citigroup has the most to gain if Trump follows through on his campaign platform. Its shares currently trade for the lowest valuation among blue-chip bank stocks, priced at a 27% discount to book value. Meanwhile, the discount on Bank of America's shares is a more reasonable 18%. And both JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo's shares trade for premiums to their book values -- at 24% and 48%, respectively, according to data from Yahoo! Finance. Additionally, Trump's promise to reduce regulations on the financial industry, and to roll back the Dodd-Frank Act in particular, should be particularly beneficial to Citigroup. Thanks to regulations passed pursuant to Dodd-Frank, the megabank must currently hold more capital relative to its assets than any other bank but JPMorgan Chase. Because this reduces the amount of leverage Citigroup can use relative to its peers, it also means the bank must work even harder than competitors to generate the type of profitability investors expect from a bank its size. Trump hasn't come out and said specifically that he intends to reduce capital requirements on banks, but if you read between the lines, that's essentially what he means when he says banks aren't loaning as much as they otherwise might under a less strict regulatory environment. Finally, if Trump's administration eliminates or dials back the annual stress tests big banks must undergo, this will also be distinctly beneficial to Citigroup. Among other things, the stress tests give regulators the authority to veto big bank capital plans -- i.e., how much they return to shareholders via dividends and stock buybacks. Citigroup has struggled more than most banks to appease regulators in the past on this front, having requests to increase its dividend denied repeatedly over the past six years. The net result is that Citigroup pays out a smaller share of its earnings by way of dividends than any other major bank. Its payout ratio is currently only 6.5%, which is half as much as Bank of America's 16%, and even less than that of JPMorgan and Wells Fargo's plus-30% payout ratios. It remains to be seen whether the stress tests will in fact be affected in this way, but if they are -- and it isn't unreasonable to think they could be -- then Citigroup could scale up its dividend faster and to a greater degree than any other big bank. This would almost certainly stimulate its share price. Thus, even though Citigroup's shares haven't risen as much since the election as they have at Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo, investors in Citigroup should feel confident that it's likely to close the gap as time passes.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Nov 14, 2016 at 2:24PM JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon is allegedly being considered for Treasury Secretary in President-elect Donald Trump's administration. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. Last week's presidential election was the best thing that's happened to bank stocks since well before the financial crisis. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of this trend, with its shares breaching new all-time highs on a daily basis. All told, JPMorgan Chase's stock has climbed 13% since before the presidential election last Tuesday. Today alone, its shares are up nearly 3% halfway through the trading session. JPM data by YCharts. Sentiment for bank stocks is improving The surge in bank stocks since the election is being fueled by President-elect Donald Trump's campaign promises to increase economic growth in the United States. His strategy is to do so through a combination of tax breaks, lower regulation, and higher government spending. Higher government expenditures to improve things like bridges, roads, and airports would serve as a particularly potent economic stimulant. Thanks to British economist John Maynard Keynes, it's been well-known for nearly a century now that the best way to get an ailing economy rapidly growing again is to offset lagging consumer expenditures with higher government spending. Not only would this boost the nation's gross domestic product, or GDP, but it would also almost certainly spur inflation -- both of which are great news for bank stocks, and JPMorgan Chase in particular. A faster growth rate would spur loan demand, which is the most important financial product banks sell. And higher inflation would translate into higher interest rates and thus wider profit margins from the loans that are made. Earlier today, The Wall Street Journal reported that economists have raised their forecasts on both counts. Economists now expect the U.S. economy to grow at 2.2% in 2017 and 2.3% the following year, compared to only about 1.5% over the past 12 months. And they expect inflation to come in at 2.2% next year, which would be the first time the figure has eclipsed the Federal Reserve's 2% threshold since the 2008 crisis. In response to expectations like these, traders sent the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds soaring on Monday. After beginning October at 1.7%, the benchmark long-term rate is now above 2%. 10-Year Treasury rate data by YCharts. Why this is good news for JPMorgan Chase If forecasts like these prove to be accurate, it will very likely lead to a surge in bank profits. In JPMorgan Chase's latest regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the bank estimates that a boost of 100 basis points to short- and long-term rates will translate into an added $2.8 billion in annual net interest income. That's not as big of a game changer for JPMorgan Chase as it is for, say, Bank of America, which would earn twice as much under a similar scenario, but it would still equate to a roughly 12% increase to JPMorgan Chase's profits based off last quarter's figures. It's important to point out as well, that Trump's promise to roll back regulations on the financial sector is likely to have a similarly positive effect on bank earnings. Trump in particular wants to roll back the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that weigh most heavily on the nation's biggest banks -- JPMorgan Chase being the largest of all. If Trump is able to follow through on these promises, it could free up hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of assets on JPMorgan Chase's balance sheet, which could then be deployed more profitably into loans as opposed to low-yielding government securities. Along these same lines, any dilution in financial consumer protection laws, which is also a priority of the Republican party, could spur innovation in the industry and reduce regulatory and compliance costs at banks like JPMorgan Chase. In short, while it remains to be seen how much of Trump's campaign agenda will materialize into actual policies, there's little question that any movement in that direction will be good news for JPMorgan Chase.

Sentiment for bank stocks is improving The surge in bank stocks since the election is being fueled by President-elect Donald Trump's campaign promises to increase economic growth in the United States. His strategy is to do so through a combination of tax breaks, lower regulation, and higher government spending. Higher government expenditures to improve things like bridges, roads, and airports would serve as a particularly potent economic stimulant. Thanks to British economist John Maynard Keynes, it's been well-known for nearly a century now that the best way to get an ailing economy rapidly growing again is to offset lagging consumer expenditures with higher government spending. Not only would this boost the nation's gross domestic product, or GDP, but it would also almost certainly spur inflation -- both of which are great news for bank stocks, and JPMorgan Chase in particular. A faster growth rate would spur loan demand, which is the most important financial product banks sell. And higher inflation would translate into higher interest rates and thus wider profit margins from the loans that are made. Earlier today, The Wall Street Journal reported that economists have raised their forecasts on both counts. Economists now expect the U.S. economy to grow at 2.2% in 2017 and 2.3% the following year, compared to only about 1.5% over the past 12 months. And they expect inflation to come in at 2.2% next year, which would be the first time the figure has eclipsed the Federal Reserve's 2% threshold since the 2008 crisis. In response to expectations like these, traders sent the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds soaring on Monday. After beginning October at 1.7%, the benchmark long-term rate is now above 2%. 10-Year Treasury rate data by YCharts. Why this is good news for JPMorgan Chase If forecasts like these prove to be accurate, it will very likely lead to a surge in bank profits. In JPMorgan Chase's latest regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the bank estimates that a boost of 100 basis points to short- and long-term rates will translate into an added $2.8 billion in annual net interest income. That's not as big of a game changer for JPMorgan Chase as it is for, say, Bank of America, which would earn twice as much under a similar scenario, but it would still equate to a roughly 12% increase to JPMorgan Chase's profits based off last quarter's figures. It's important to point out as well, that Trump's promise to roll back regulations on the financial sector is likely to have a similarly positive effect on bank earnings. Trump in particular wants to roll back the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that weigh most heavily on the nation's biggest banks -- JPMorgan Chase being the largest of all. If Trump is able to follow through on these promises, it could free up hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of assets on JPMorgan Chase's balance sheet, which could then be deployed more profitably into loans as opposed to low-yielding government securities. Along these same lines, any dilution in financial consumer protection laws, which is also a priority of the Republican party, could spur innovation in the industry and reduce regulatory and compliance costs at banks like JPMorgan Chase. In short, while it remains to be seen how much of Trump's campaign agenda will materialize into actual policies, there's little question that any movement in that direction will be good news for JPMorgan Chase.

Agents arrested Ricardo Hill, 38, last month. A criminal complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan charged him with conspiring to operate an unlicensed bitcoin exchange called Coin.mx. Prosecutors have said that the exchange was masterminded by Gery Shalon, an Israeli accused of orchestrating a massive attack on JPMorgan and other companies, and that it was operated by another Florida man, Anthony Murgio. FBI Special Agent Joel Decapua wrote in the complaint filed against Hill in October that Hill was aware the exchange was being used to launder the loot from ransomware schemes. Hill began working for Coin.mx as a marketing manager and business development coordinator in January 2014. According to the complaint, Hill discussed with the other operators how dealing with ransomware crooks could get them brought up on charges of money laundering. Coin.mx allegedly kept processing payments on behalf of the victims of ransomware schemes, pocketing a 7.5% fee with the transactions, which were likely to be reported as fraudulent. One of the ransomware schemes that lined the pockets of the bitcoin exchange operators was the infamous CryptoLocker: one of the best-known ransomware variants ever released, and one that’s spawned clones such as CryptoWall. Another of its offspring was one that borrowed the CryptoLocker name and then got packaged up with a phishing email about fake speeding fines. According to Hill’s estimates, ransomware victims made up about 40% percent of Coin.mx’s customers, based on the volume of calls he received from them, the complaint said. Sophos Home Stop ransomware with our free personal security software Learn More In November 2015, the Justice Department charged Shalon, Orenstein, and an American named Joshua Samuel Aaron with computer hacking crimes against JPMorgan, as well as other financial institutions, brokerage firms and financial news reporters, including the Wall Street Journal. Aaron was a fugitive until last month, when he turned up at a facility for illegal immigrants outside Moscow. He had failed to show police a valid passport during a midnight check at his apartment, according to court documents seen by Bloomberg. The JPMorgan breach was initially thought to involve the theft of as many as 83 million customer records. Altogether, the trio has been accused of ripping off the data of more than 100 million customers from JPMorgan and other companies, and then using it in schemes such as stock manipulation that generated hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit gains. Hill was released on $75,000 bond on Thursday. Pending his trial, the court also barred him from going on to money exchanges via the internet.

Do you recall that on Feb.11, with the banks at a low, Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase  (JPM) , plunked down of $26.6 million to buy 500,000 shares in the open market at $53.18. At today's price of $80, that's worth $40 million. At the time he bought the stock he said it was cheap. Every stock is cheap to every CEO. But when you see that kind of buying, that's not some "paint the tape" couple-of-thousand share buy that people talk about. That's real money -- what we used to call a "statement" buy.

Nov. 15, 2016 (KXAN Photo/Phil Prazan) Related Coverage Hundreds march through downtown protesting President-elect Trump Texas oil magnate sits out pipeline vote after protests PHOTOS: Police oust pipeline protesters in North Dakota AUSTIN (KXAN) — A rally and march against the Dakota Access Pipeline at 5 p.m. Tuesday affected rush hour traffic in downtown Austin. Austin police warned drivers to avoid the area, if possible, and find an alternate route. After speaking on the south steps of the State Capitol, protesters marched to Wells Fargo offices at 111 Congress Ave. and JP Morgan Chase offices at 221 W. 6th St. In a Facebook event post for the march, organizers say Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the North Dakota pipeline project. The post also says President-elect Donald Trump has around $1 million invested in the pipeline builder. The pipeline construction site is just outside the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in southern North Dakota. The tribe fears the pipeline will disturb sacred sites and impact drinking water for thousands of tribal members on the reservation and millions farther downstream. One man at the protest wearing a black handkerchief urged others to smash the bank windows, but organizers from the Sierra Club calmed him down, telling KXAN’s Phil Prazan that was not their message and they didn’t want any arrests or violence. No one was arrested and the march peacefully went back up to the Capitol where supporters said they’re glad their message wasn’t distracted. “If I could go to the pipelines I totally would, but I also have to work and also have to go to school,” said marcher Martha Marquez. “So this is my small little participation I can give to my community.” The Austin Police Department says that while marches and political protests on city streets normally require a permit, the city of Austin has a long history of spontaneous and non-permitted protests. “In the spirit of the First Amendment, the Department regularly attempts to coordinate these events with protesters to ensure a balanced policing approach,” police said. Downtown traffic has been blocked several times in the past week during protests against the president-elect. Six were arrested at the Capitol on Sunday and two were arrested on Thursday, Nov. 10. Hundreds, mainly University of Texas at Austin students, marched throughout downtown the day after the election, blocking First Street and Congress Avenue bridges at times.

DJIA S&P 500 NASDAQ Markets Today TCW's Four Top Dividend Paying Stocks for 2017 Four Dividend Payers for 2017: JPMorgan, GE, Chevron and Microsoft. Gregg Greenberg Nov 15, 2016 4:10 PM EST JPMorgan (JPM) shares are flirting with an all-time high, up over 18% year-to-date, and still they remain a bargain, said Diane Jaffee, portfolio manager for the TCW Relative Value Dividend Appreciation Fund (TGDFX) . The TCW Relative Value Dividend Appreciation Fund is up 12.5% thus far in 2016, according to Morningstar. The $1.1 billion fund has returned an average of 13.8% annually over the past five years, outpacing 84% of its rivals in Morningstar's large value stock category. Jaffe is also bullish on GE (GE) , down 2.7% year-to-date, saying the company is expanding its capabilities with regard to the internet of things. Chevron (CVX) is another one of Jaffee's top picks. The oil major, which yields 4%, is up 21% thus far in 2016 even though oil stubbornly remains below $50 a barrel. Jaffee said Chevron is becoming "cleaner" with its LNG initiatives in Australia and will also start to see cash flow spike in 2017 as its capex declines. Finally, Jaffee is a fan of Microsoft (MSFT) , which is up 6% so far in 2016 and pays a 2.6% dividend. She expects the company's $26 billion investment in LinkedIn to start paying off in 2017, calling it the "perfect database" for Microsoft's customers.

Charges were levied in May 2014 against the three banks, which denied wrongdoing. The European Commission could penalise HSBC, JPMorgan and Credit Agricole next month, the people said. The decision has been delayed several times and another hold-up could still occur. European Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso declined to comment. The EU competition enforcer can levy fines up to 10 percent of a company's global turnover for breaching the bloc's rules. JPMorgan said the EU charges were without merit when it was served the document and that it would defend itself. Credit Agricole has said it would examine the charge sheet. HSBC said at that time that it would defend itself vigorously. Deutsche Bank , RBS and Societe Generale admitted guilt in December 2013. Barclays avoided a fine because it alerted the Commission. U.S. and European regulators have so far handed down billion-dollar fines to more than 10 banks and brokerages for rigging the London interbank offered rate (Libor) and its euro cousin Euribor. Prosecutors have also charged more than a dozen men with fraud-related offences.

Trio shunned settlement and were sent formal complaint in 2014 Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp JPMorgan Chase & Co., HSBC Holdings Plc and Credit Agricole SA are set to face antitrust fines as soon as next month over rigging the Euribor benchmark, wrapping up a five-year European Union investigation, according to two people familiar with the status of the case. EU regulators are making the final touches on a decision to fine the trio who shunned a settlement in late 2013, said the people who asked not to be identified because the decision isn’t public. The four other banks in the same probe agreed to pay penalties totaling about 825 million euros ($888 million.) The EU’s investigation into Euribor manipulation was strained three years ago after Credit Agricole, JPMorgan and HSBC refused to join the multi-bank settlement with four other lenders including Deutsche Bank AG and Societe Generale SA. Since then, the holdouts have been a thorn in the European Commission’s side -- successfully delaying the process and showing up the regulator for its handling of the case. Global Scandal The three lenders were handed a statement of objections in May 2014 accusing them of colluding to rig Euribor rates in the wake of a global scandal embroiling some of the world’s biggest banks. Such filings in cartel cases are usually a precursor to fines. By refusing to settle the case with the commission they forfeited the chance of a 10 percent discount on any fines. “We continue to defend ourselves vigorously on this matter,” HSBC said in an e-mailed statement. JPMorgan and Credit Agricole declined to comment, as did representatives for the European Commission, the EU’s antitrust authority. JPMorgan previously said it had cooperated fully with the commission throughout its investigation, adding that the bank doesn’t believe it engaged in wrongdoing with respect to the Euribor benchmark and intends to defend itself fully. Next Year While EU regulators are targeting next month, the timing could still slip into early next year in a probe that has been beset by delays, said the people familiar with the matter. The four banks that settled were accused of sharing, via phone and through online chats, sensitive trading information among themselves and strategizing to push Euribor rates up or down to suit their trading positions. About $9 billion in fines have been levied against a dozen banks by global authorities over the manipulation of the London interbank offered rate and similar benchmarks in the last four years and more than 20 traders charged. Last year, Tom Hayes, a former UBS Group AG and Citigroup Inc. employee, became the first trader to be jailed over the Libor scandal, and is serving an 11-year sentence in the U.K. for his part in rigging Yen Libor. Several Euribor traders from Deutsche Bank and Barclays are due to stand trial in London next year. One trader from Societe Generale has also been charged. Earlier this year, the EU slashed Societe Generale’s Euribor penalty by 218 million euros due to a calculation “mistake” the bank made in supplying sales data to antitrust regulators. Libor and Euribor, the euro interbank offered rate, gauge banks’ estimated cost of borrowing over different periods of time. The rates are a benchmark used to calculate interest payments for financial products including mortgages. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Music News Entertainment Politics Features Share < br />this article: Report: Former Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin frontrunner for secretary of treasury In Politics by Jamie Peck / November 14, 2016 Share < br />this article: Follow @jamie_elizabeth Last week, there was some speculation that Donald Trump meant to ask JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon to be the U.S. Treasury Secretary, despite the fact that he didn’t want the job. Now Bloomberg News reports that former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner Steven Mnuchin is the transition team’s top pick, as had been earlier speculated. Bloomberg News reports that two sources “familiar with the process” say the prominent capitalist is the transition team’s top pick for the job. This would make sense, as Mnuchin threw in with Trump early and helped him raise millions of dollars as finance chairman of his campaign. After amassing a fortune of over $40 million via his position at Goldman Sachs, he left the investment banking firm and took his money to Hollywood, where he has produced big budget films like “Suicide Squad” and the “X-Men” franchise. Assuming Mnuchin gets the job, his appointment will represent one more departure from Trump’s populist rhetoric. While Trump gained middle class support by pledging to take on Wall Street and the political establishment, it doesn’t get much more establishment than Mnuchin, who would be the third ex-Goldman executive to fill the post since the mid-1990s (one under Clinton, and one under Bush II). As Bloomberg points out, his resume reads like a parody of everything Trump voters hate, right down to his involvement in the 2009 foreclosure crisis Via Bloomberg: Before joining Trump, Mnuchin rose through the kind of elite institutions the president-elect spent his campaign vilifying. Mnuchin was tapped into Yale’s Skull and Bones secret society, became a Goldman Sachs partner like his father before him, ran a hedge fund, worked with George Soros, funded Hollywood blockbusters and bought a failed bank, IndyMac, with billionaires including John Paulson. They renamed it OneWest, drew protests for foreclosing on U.S. borrowers, and ultimately generated considerable profits, selling the business last year to CIT Group Inc. for $3.4 billion. On the upside, he’s probably no worse than Hillary Clinton’s secretary of the treasury would have been, which is more than we can say of some Trump appointments.

You might need to take a pill to figure out if you'll be hit with a surprise ATM fee even if you're a customer of this huge bank. Customers using Chase ATMs at Walgreens and Duane Reade locations could be getting new notifications that they'll have to pay a surcharge if they try to withdraw their own cash from the machines. In April, Cardtronics announced it bought 2,586 ATMs from Chase, primarily in Walgreens and Duane Reades, as well at several airports and other retail locations across the U.S. Pat Kiernan, a weekday morning anchor for local cable television news channel NY1 and a Chase customer, was using a Chase ATM at the Duane Reade inside Penn Station in New York City on Monday morning. He was about to withdraw cash from the machine , but stopped when he saw a notification on the screen saying he would incur a $3 surcharge imposed by Cardtronics. Previously, Chase customers such as Kiernan were exempt from such fees at stand-alone Chase ATMs in such locations. "I don't understand how hard it is to take the sign off the ATM before you change the software," Kiernan told CNBC. @patkiernan: Bad enough that @Chase sold off its convenient Duane Reade ATMs. Beware - they're off Chase network but still have Chase signs. #surcharge Penn Station is the busiest railway station in North America, serving 1,000 passengers every 90 seconds, according to Railway Technology. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority said the station served more than 50 million riders in 2015. It's the busiest station in the Amtrak system, serving more than 10 million passengers a year. It is also the busiest New Jersey Transit station, accommodating more than 92,000 average weekday boardings. Weeks ago, Chase's customer service team said via Twitter that "if it has the Chase logo on or around the ATM, then it is a Chase ATM." @Chase ATM in Duane Reade now says Cardtronics. Will I be charged fee if I use it? 99% of my w/draws are at DRs, branches r inconvenient @AlykatAlyssa If it has the Chase logo on or around the ATM, then it is a Chase ATM. ^WP Chase spokesman Mike Fusco, when contacted about Kiernan's situation, told CNBC he would look into why the screens on Chase ATMs reflected Cardtronics ownership while the Chase logo and signage remained. "From now until early next year, we've been notifying customers on the screens that the machine will no longer be a Chase ATM," Fusco said. "But as long as the Chase brand remains on the screen, it will remain free for customers." Photo: Pat Kiernan A Chase-branded ATM that says it will charge Chase customers a fee for using Fusco later followed up with an email to CNBC that said the "message" on the ATM screen that Kiernan saw "is incorrect." "And we are working with Cardtronics to fix the issue," Fusco said. "We have confirmed that Chase customers are not being charged and we will continue to monitor." A Cardtronics spokesman told CNBC the company has been integrating locations into its ATM fleet since its announcement in April announcement. He said the company "expects to have news on the topic of ATM branding later this year." — CNBC's Dan Mangan contributed to this report.

E.S.T. Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story BEIJING — Asian stocks were mostly lower Tuesday as expectations of a U.S. rate hike boosted the dollar and investors watched President-elect Donald Trump for signs of policy direction. KEEPING SCORE: The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.2 percent to 3,204.31 points and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 was flat at 17,670.77. Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 tumbled 0.5 percent to 5,320.60 and Seoul's Kospi was almost unchanged at 1,974.27. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.4 percent to 22,314.62. Benchmarks in Southeast Asia and New Zealand were mixed. WALL STREET: Tech companies including Apple and Microsoft took big losses on concern Trump's policies might hurt their sales in China and other global markets. Bank stocks surged as bond yields rose, which allows them to make more money from lending. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,868.69, another all-time high. The Standard & Poor's 500 index dipped 0.25 points to 2,164.20 after it fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Nasdaq composite sank 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. RISING DOLLAR: The dollar climbed as high as 108.30 yen from Monday's 107.87 yen as expectations of a U.S. rate hike rose. Trump's surprise election initially raised expectations the Federal Reserve might put off a rate hike until his plans were clear. But analysts say the latest comments from Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan indicate the Fed is sticking to plans to act in December. "There appears no stopping the U.S. dollar's recent ascent based on the current interest rate trajectory," Stephen Innes of OANDA said in a report. TRUMP WATCH: Investors were watching for signs of what Trump, who gave few details of his plans on the campaign trail, might do in office. Analysts say his promises of tax cuts and higher infrastructure spending could boost economic growth but also spur inflation. His threats of sanctions against China and other trading partners that he accuses of acting unfairly have rattled trade-dependent Asian economies. ANALYST'S TAKE: "Moving forward, the spotlight could shine on the contentious trade policy proposals that the president-elect had raised during his campaign," said Jingyi Pan of IG in a report. "The latest soundbite from outgoing President Barack Obama seems to suggest that the incoming president is 'ultimately pragmatic'," said Pan. "It is without a doubt that emerging Asian markets would be negatively impacted should a trade war break out between US and China, although the delayed address could mean that the President-elect may indeed be more pragmatic than we have known."

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • Bank stocks are climbing Monday morning as bond yields continue to rise. Bond yields are climbing to their highest levels this year, which points to higher interest rates and bigger profits for banks from lending money. Investors have been selling bonds, pushing yields higher, as they expect the spending plans of president-elect Donald Trump to lead to higher inflation. The big moves for financial firms are pulling the broader stock market higher. Investors are selling companies that pay big dividends like utilities and phone companies as bonds become more appealing to investors seeking income. The dollar is also rising. VIDEOS TOP JOBS KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average rose 79 points, or 0.4 percent, to 18,926 as of 8:20 a.m. Mountain time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 6 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,170. The Nasdaq composite added 3 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,240. BANK BONANZA: Bank stocks continued to surge. They're rising in part because of the big jump in bond yields since the election. Investors are also pleased at the prospect of looser regulation and bigger profits. Trump's election could result in big changes to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill or to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Bank of America rose 98 cents, or 5.1 percent, to $20 and JPMorgan Chase picked up $2.96 percent, or 3.9 percent, to $79.65. DOING DEALS: South Korean conglomerate Samsung said it will buy Harman International for $8 billion, or $112 a share. Harman makes products for connected cars including audio systems and safety and entertainment features. Its stock jumped $22.08, or 25.2 percent, to $109.73. MENTORING: German industrial equipment company Siemens agreed to buy software maker Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion, or $37.25 a share. Mentor's stock rose $5.67, or 18.5 percent, to $36.35. DIG IT: Shares of communication adapter maker Digi International rose $1.83, or 14.8 percent, to $13.38 after the company said it received an offer from Belden, a communications equipment company. Digi said it rejected the bid of $13.82 a share, or about $359 million, because it's too low. Belden stock added $1.88, or 2.7 percent, to $71.58. BONDS: Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.25 percent. Bond trading was closed Friday for the U.S. Veterans' Day holiday. The 10-year yield, which is a benchmark for interest rates on home mortgages and other kinds of loans, finished at 2.06 percent on Thursday. The day before the Nov. 8 presidential election the yield was 1.83 percent. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose sharply against other currencies as U.S. interest rates rose. It jumped to 108.41 Japanese yen from 106.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0714 from $1.0845. LAGGARDS: Stocks that pay large dividends, like phone and utility companies and real estate investment trusts, all traded lower. Those stocks are most appealing to investors when bond yields are low. American Tower fell $4.64, or 4.4 percent, to $101.07 and NextEra Energy lost $2.42, or 2.1 percent, to $111.12. TRUMP FACTOR: Stocks went into a long skid as the presidential campaign came to its conclusion, but in the last few days stocks have risen as investors hope a Trump presidency will mean cutbacks in regulations that affect energy and banks, among other businesses. The Dow has reached record highs, with the biggest recent gains going to financial firms Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, machinery maker Caterpillar and drug company Merck. ENERGY: With the dollar gaining strength, benchmark U.S. crude fell 59 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $42.82 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 55 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $44.20 a barrel in London. OVERSEAS: France's CAC 40 was up 0.4 percent and Germany's DAX rose 0.3 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was 0.3 percent higher. In Japan the Nikkei 225 jumped 1.7 percent after a strong reading on Japan's economic growth. The dollar has been particularly strong against the Japanese yen lately and that's helped the country's exporters. Most other Asian markets fell. The Kospi in South Korea lost 0.5 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 1.4 percent.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Op-ed: Should Mormons who voted for Trump get temple recommends?

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........BEIJING — Asian stocks were mostly lower Tuesday as expectations of a U.S. rate hike boosted the dollar and investors watched President-elect Donald Trump for signs of policy direction. KEEPING SCORE: The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.2 percent to 3,204.31 points and Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 was flat at 17,670.77. Sydney’s S&P-ASX 200 tumbled 0.5 percent to 5,320.60 and Seoul’s Kospi was almost unchanged at 1,974.27. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 0.4 percent to 22,314.62. Benchmarks in Southeast Asia and New Zealand were mixed. WALL STREET: Tech companies including Apple and Microsoft took big losses on concern Trump’s policies might hurt their sales in China and other global markets. Bank stocks surged as bond yields rose, which allows them to make more money from lending. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,868.69, another all-time high. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index dipped 0.25 points to 2,164.20 after it fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Nasdaq composite sank 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. RISING DOLLAR: The dollar climbed as high as 108.30 yen from Monday’s 107.87 yen as expectations of a U.S. rate hike rose. Trump’s surprise election initially raised expectations the Federal Reserve might put off a rate hike until his plans were clear. But analysts say the latest comments from Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan indicate the Fed is sticking to plans to act in December. “There appears no stopping the U.S. dollar’s recent ascent based on the current interest rate trajectory,” Stephen Innes of OANDA said in a report. TRUMP WATCH: Investors were watching for signs of what Trump, who gave few details of his plans on the campaign trail, might do in office. Analysts say his promises of tax cuts and higher infrastructure spending could boost economic growth but also spur inflation. His threats of sanctions against China and other trading partners that he accuses of acting unfairly have rattled trade-dependent Asian economies. Advertisement Continue reading ANALYST’S TAKE: “Moving forward, the spotlight could shine on the contentious trade policy proposals that the president-elect had raised during his campaign,” said Jingyi Pan of IG in a report. “The latest soundbite from outgoing President Barack Obama seems to suggest that the incoming president is ‘ultimately pragmatic’,” said Pan. “It is without a doubt that emerging Asian markets would be negatively impacted should a trade war break out between US and China, although the delayed address could mean that the President-elect may indeed be more pragmatic than we have known.” CURRENCY: The euro was little-changed at $1.0752. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude gained 89 cents to $44.21 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract shed 9 cents on Monday to close at $43.32. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 75 cents to $45.19 in London. It lost 32 cents on Monday to $44.43.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks came back from an early loss and finished almost unchanged Monday. Technology companies like Apple and Microsoft took big losses on fears about their overseas revenue, but bank stocks continued to surge along with bond yields. Technology stocks have been weak since last week's election, and they fell further Monday as investors wonder if Donald Trump's policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas. Bank stocks built on their post-election gains as bond yields continued to rise. That paves the way for banks to make more money from lending. Government bond yields are now at their highest levels since January. "The market is sniffing out the belief that some of these Trump policies may drive some better economic growth but also may in fact be somewhat inflationary," said PNC Chief Investment Strategist Bill Stone. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,868.69, another all-time high. The Standard & Poor's 500 index dipped 0.25 points to 2,164.20 after it fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Nasdaq composite sank 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. Technology companies fell sharply, with familiar names taking some of the largest losses. Apple gave up $2.72, or 2.5 percent, to $105.71 while Facebook declined $3.94, or 3.3 percent, to $115.08 and Microsoft slid 90 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $58.12. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slipped $18.53, or 2.4 percent, to $753.22. Bond prices fell and yields jumped as investors anticipated that Trump's spending plans would lead to higher inflation and more government borrowing. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note climbed to 2.25 percent from 2.14 percent late Thursday. Bond trading was closed Friday for the Veterans' Day holiday. The day before the Nov. 8 election, the yield was 1.83 percent. That's a huge move for that benchmark rate. Goldman Sachs rose $5.24 percent, to 2.6 percent, to $209.18 and Bank of America rose $1.06, or 5.6 percent, to $20.08. JPMorgan Chase picked up $2.82, or 3.7 percent, to $79.51. Stone said investors are focused on potential corporate and individual tax cuts, a "wave of deregulation" that eliminates some of the rules governing businesses like energy companies and banks, and more protectionism on trade, which could hurt sales for companies that do a lot of business overseas. Investors are also pleased at the prospect of looser regulation and bigger profits. For example, Trump's election could result in big changes to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill or to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Stone added that corporate dealmaking could increase if Trump's administration takes a looser approach to antitrust regulation. Several companies announced deals or deal offers Monday. South Korean conglomerate Samsung said it will buy Harman International for $8 billion, or $112 a share. Harman makes electronics for cars including audio systems and safety and entertainment features. Its stock jumped $22.07, or 25.2 percent, to $109.72. German industrial equipment company Siemens agreed to buy software maker Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion, or $37.25 a share. Mentor's stock rose $5.61, or 18.3 percent, to $36.29. Shares of communication adapter maker Digi International rose $1.75, or 15 percent, to $13.40 after the company said it received an offer from Belden, a communications equipment company. Digi said it rejected the bid of $13.82 a share, or about $359 million, because it's too low. Belden stock added $1.52, or 2.2 percent, to $71.22. The dollar rose against other currencies as U.S. interest rates rose. It jumped to 108.51 Japanese yen from 106.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0726 from $1.0845. Investors are also selling companies that pay big dividends like utilities and phone companies as bonds become more appealing to investors seeking income. Verizon fell 51 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $46.18 and American Electric Power lost $1.27, or 2.1 percent, to $58.72.

News Stocks Technology Science Health Politics World Videos The Tape Latest Follow WSP Newsletter RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Search for: HomeNewsHow to Play the Stock Market Under President Trump How to Play the Stock Market Under President Trump It’s a rare event when one of Wall Street's most accurate forecasters says the U.S. stock market is poised to go higher. November 14, 2016 WSP The massive stock market rally following Donald Trump’s stunning win and the Republican sweep of the Congress that briefly carried The Dow Jones to its biggest jump since Dec. 2011 and to a record high of 18,855, still has more to go on the upside despite Friday’s retracement. “We think [the markets] can go a bit higher from here,” JPMorgan’s (NYSE:JPM) Marko Kolanovic told CNBC’s “Fast Money” this week. Kolanovic, seen as one of Wall Street’s most accurate forecasters, predicts that Trump’s policies, which would include more fiscal spending and a cut in corporate and personal income taxes, which by the way is bullish for stocks as it will boost growth prospects, would be great for equities—at least in the short-term. “This would be reflationary in nature,” he said. JPMorgan, which has a 2,100 year-end price target for the S&P 500, implying the index will decline by nearly 3% by the end of the year, says the S&P, which is currently trading at 2,164.45 points, or only within 2% of a record price, could surge to 2,300, or 6.3% from current levels in early fiscal 2017. However, Kolanovic acknowledged the risks that some of Trump’s policies like his protectionist agenda when it comes to trade by threatening to slap a 45% tariff on Chinese imports, declare China a currency manipulator on his first day in office, or tax imports from Mexico, pose to the markets. If Trump were to pursue these policies, they might spark a global trade war, “which could easily trigger a global recession,” Citigroup’s Willem Buiter wrote in a note to clients. “There are still uncertainties,” noted JPMorgan’s Kolanovic. “We do think that should keep realized volatility over the market a bit elevated. There are going to be things the market is going to be surprised” about,” he said. “I wouldn’t necessarily shun all safe-haven assets.” Previous article Next article Be the first to comment Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

 Donald Trump's win looks like good news for Wall Street — and bank stocks are flying high Portia Crowe Nov. 10, 2016, 2:56 PM 3,498 facebook linkedin twitter email print Stuart C. Wilson / Stringer / Getty Images US bank stocks were climbing for a second straight day Thursday following president-elect Donald Trump's electoral win. Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo all ended the day in the green Thursday. Most were up by about 4%, while Wells Fargo closed up 7.4%. One major reason for the jump appears to be because Trump is expected to reduce regulation hampering bank profitability. His win could also lead to increased inflation pressures, indicating that the Federal Reserve could begin increasing its rate of interest rate hikes. Trading desks could also benefit from increased market volatility. There are, of course, some risks for the financial industry on the horizon, as KBW's Frederick Cannon and Brian Gardner highlighted in a recent note. Those include a US retrenchment from the global economy and trade agreements. Regional banks could perform better than the universal banks in the long-term because of the larger banks' international exposure. Citigroup, Bank of America, and JPMorgan, for example, have larger international lending portfolios and could be hurt by isolationism, the analysts wrote. Citigroup in particular is at risk from its large exposure to Mexico and other emerging markets, wrote KBW's Brian Kleinhanzl, noting that Citi generates 40% of its revenue from emerging markets. But, as the analysts point out, the near-term benefits appear clearer and more immediate than the risks. Reduced regulation? On the regulatory front, the market appears to be pricing in the fact that Trump's administration will introduce laxer rules. Trump has said he would "dismantle" the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act, for example, and "massively" cut back on other regulation. He has also said that he disagrees with breaking up the big banks, according to Barclays' Jason Goldberg. This would be good news for banks. That said, neither KBW's nor Barclay's analysts believe the Dodd-Frank Act will ultimately be repealed. Barclays' Goldberg also does not believe that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will be dismantled, as has also been suggested. The analysts over at Fitch wrote in a note Thursday that the elimination of the CFPB, if it were to happen, would be "unlikely to have a material impact for banks in the aggregate," noting that there has been little talk of repealing the Volcker Rule, specifically. Economic growth? For Goldberg, the main reason Trump's win could be a boon for the banks is if he has a positive impact on GDP growth. "While it's unclear the ultimate impact the new administration will have on GDP growth, it bears watching closely," Goldberg wrote. "Factors that could influence growth either way include increased infrastructure spending, reduced taxes, a potentially larger federal deficit, possibly higher interest rates/inflation and reduced global trade." And from Fitch: "Generally, US financial institutions' performance tends to be correlated with the overall US macroeconomic environment, particularly as it relates to economic growth. Judging by the campaign, the new administration's economic policy is likely to revolve around tax cuts, renegotiating trade agreements, de-regulation and higher infrastructure spending." Of course, there's a big "if" here. As Fitch's analysts wrote, "it remains to be seen the degree to which Trump will implement or be able to carry out his policy initiatives and the long-term effect policy changes will have on growth."

 Incoming Nasdaq CEO says Trump policies may benefit Wall Street Reuters Nov. 15, 2016, 2:22 PM 489 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Carlyle Group's Friedman speaks at the Women in Finance Symposium at the Treasury Department in Washington Thomson Reuters By John McCrank NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nasdaq Inc's incoming chief executive officer, Adena Friedman, said on Tuesday that President-elect Donald Trump's economic policies may boost trading and allow banks to take more risks, including lending more to businesses. Nasdaq on Monday announced Friedman, currently president and chief operating officer, would replace long-time CEO Robert Greifeld in January, making her one of the most powerful women on Wall Street. She said regulations following the 2008 financial crisis meant to reduce risk-taking by banks were well intentioned, but that some may have gone too far. She called for a more "balanced approach to regulation." "There are elements of the regulation that we are living with today that have hampered the ability for banks to provide an important role in providing liquidity into the markets," Friedman said at a JPMorgan Chase & Co investor conference. Those rules have not only hurt trading volumes but hindered lending to small- and medium-sized businesses, she said. Trump promised during his campaign to slash taxes and regulation, including the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reforms aimed at curbing risk taking by banks and protecting consumers, which he said makes it hard for banks to loan money. Provisions of Dodd-Frank included the Volcker Rule, which restricts speculative investments by banks, and the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to police areas like mortgage servicing, debt collection and payday lending. Trump adviser Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge-fund industry executive, has said that Dodd-Frank would be reviewed and "the worst anti-business parts of it will be gutted." Mary Jo White, outgoing chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said on Tuesday she would not want to see parts of Dodd-Frank, including the Volcker Rule, rescinded or repealed. The SEC does not have evidence that the rules have affected market liquidity, she said in testimony to the House Financial Services Committee. White said on Monday she planned to depart the SEC around the same time President Barack Obama leaves the White House.

After spending a vast majority of time in 2016 underwater, BofA is finally on pace to deliver the goods for shareholders. A string of exceptionally strong earnings reports puts Bank of America stock into position. However, there can be no mistake that a surprise Donald Trump victory in this year’s contentious election was the primary catalyst for BAC stock. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr Post-election, BAC has jumped 12% in the markets. But it’s not just the fact that BofA has suddenly found new life. Its primary competitors within the “Big Four” banking complex have also seen a massive resurgence. Leading star JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) tacked on 10% since Trump’s victory, while Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) gained 6%. Even the controversy-laden Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) had a stellar ride. In fact, WFC led the Trump tailwind, moving up 14%. Bank of America Stock Gets Unexpected Help It’s a new era for the banking sector, and Bank of America stock is sure to reap the benefits. The financial industry has been hampered by an extremely stringent regulatory environment. Republicans, who are generally viewed as more business-friendly than Democrats, should help ease this burden. That the outspoken billionaire turned President-elect has full control to run the “Trump Mandate” is lost on no one. The irony, of course, is that the Republicans and their looser approach were held responsible for the 2008 financial crisis. As with virtually every other investment, Bank of America stock was devastated at the time, eventually requiring outside help. The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2017 While it’s unfair to pin everything on one particular party, the perception was that the government had no oversight on big banks. For nearly a decade, BofA has been trying to shed its thorny past. The 2016 election result couldn’t have come at a better time for BAC stock. The Wells Fargo controversy — in which millions of fake customer accounts were created to boost sales figures — did absolutely zero favors for the industry. So harmful was the impact that when the fraud was revealed, it took down other banks, BofA included. For the month of September, Bank of America stock dropped 2%, reversing two months of bullishness. Had Hillary Clinton won the White House, it’s doubtful that anyone would have bought BAC stock. Americans voted for President Obama partially as an indictment of the Republicans’ economic policy. Clinton would have surely turned the regulatory screws tighter. What’s Next for BofA? Bank of America stock escaped a bullet, big time. Not only that, what was supposed to be a collapse of the Republican Party has now imploded the Democrats. A supportive ideology could potentially take root for BofA for years to come. Now, the question becomes, what specifically can BAC stock do with it? Click to Enlarge With the shackles off, you have to like the upside potential for Bank of America stock. Year-to-date, shares are up 18% in the markets. True, a huge chunk of that is resultant of the surprise election of Donald Trump. Nevertheless, you have to give credit where credit is due. BofA has been steadily chipping away at bearish pressure all year, and now, it is seeing its just reward.

Back To Top[*] Trump considering Mnuchin and Ross for economy jobs Nov. 16, 2016 - 07:00AM JST Longtime Donald Trump supporter and activist investor Carl Icahn confirmed on Tuesday that the president-elect is looking at Wall Street veteran Steven Mnuchin as his choice for treasury secretary and billionaire Wilbur Ross for commerce secretary. “Spoke to @realDonaldTrump. Steve Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross are being considered for Treasury and Commerce. Both would be great choices,” Icahn wrote on Twitter. Icahn, a close ally of Trump who was often praised by the Republican during the presidential campaign for his business acumen, also tweeted that both Mnuchin and Ross were friends and “two of the smartest people I know.” Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner and Trump’s campaign finance manager, has been considered a front-runner for the Treasury post for much of the past week since Trump’s stunning election victory. Mnuchin’s inclusion in Trump’s campaign team was questioned at the time by Stephen Bannon, now Trump’s chief White House strategist. In an interview on Breitbart News, Bannon asked Trump whether the then presidential candidate was “selling out to Wall Street”. The list to head the Treasury Department has also included JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon and Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee. Hensarling has said he would prefer to focus on a revamp of financial regulation, while Dimon, a lifelong Democrat, has denied interest in the job in the past. Ross, a billionaire investor, is a part of Trump’s economic advisory team. Calls to Ross were not immediately returned. Mnuchin walked through the Trump Tower lobby in Manhattan on Tuesday morning. He would not comment on personnel decisions but said the Trump team is “making sure we get the biggest tax bill passed, the biggest tax changes since Reagan. So a lot of exciting things in the first 100 days of the Trump presidency.” With Republicans retaining majorities in Congress, Trump will have a clearer shot at enacting major tax cut and reform legislation and rolling back the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulation law passed in the wake of the financial crisis. The new treasury secretary would play a key role in crafting such legislation, as well as managing potential new debt issuance of as much as $1 trillion if Congress agrees to Trump’s proposed infrastructure spending program. With such high stakes, Wall Street is more focused on the selection of the next treasury chief than it was during President Barack Obama’s choices for the post. “This time will be different,” Gregory Peters, senior investment officer at Prudential Fixed Income, said Tuesday at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit in New York. “That role takes on greater importance.” Unlike current Secretary Jacob Lew, who is viewed investors to have taken a lower profile focused largely on international issues over the past year, the next Treasury secretary is expected to be a featured player in articulating and executing the Trump administration’s new economic policies and initiatives. A figure such as Mnuchin, with Wall Street experience, might be seen as better equipped to manage the relationship between Treasury and the banks that facilitate U.S. debt issuance. The last Wall Street insider to serve in the post was Henry Paulson, the former Goldman Sachs CEO appointed by George W. Bush and whose term was dominated by the bank bailouts of the 2008 financial crisis. Mnuchin, whose father was also a Goldman Sachs partner,  worked at the investment bank for nearly two decades starting in the mid-1980s, a time when Wall Street was developing major financial innovations including new securitization techniques and collateralized debt obligations—instruments that would later contribute to the financial crisis. In 2009, he led a group of investors that purchased the assets of failed California-based mortgage lender IndyMac, for $1.55 billion that included a loss-sharing deal with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. After rehabilitating the operation and rebranding it as OneWest Bank, they sold it in 2014 for $3.4 billion to CIT Group Inc for $3.4 billion.

Technology stocks like Microsoft and Google's parent Alphabet traded higher and bond yields slipped, a break with the pattern since last week's election. Oil rose almost 6 percent as investors once again grew hopeful that the OPEC cartel will agree to cut fuel production in a few weeks. Companies like utilities and telecom service providers climbed as bond yields fell slightly after a week of large gains. Airlines rose after Warren Buffett made a surprise investment in three carriers. "The market somehow decided 'let's give the Trump presidency a chance," said John DeClue, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank's private client reserve. However DeClue said the bond market could struggle with Trump in the White House: if taxes are cut and government spending rises sharply, that could lead to climbing deficits that would trouble investors in U.S. government debt. The Dow Jones industrial average picked up 54.37 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,923.06, as those gains were partly held back by losses for retailer Home Depot and aerospace company Boeing. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 16.19 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,180.39. The Nasdaq composite added 57.23 points, or 1.1 percent, to 5,275.62. Energy companies like Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum made large gains as the price of oil rose by the largest amount since early April. At least for a day, investors were hopeful that the nations of OPEC will be able to hammer out a deal to cut oil production, which would boost prices. OPEC agreed to a preliminary deal in September but still have to work out important details. Benchmark U.S. crude gained $2.49, or 5.7 percent, to $45.81 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose $2.52, or 5.7 percent, to $46.95 a barrel in London. Exxon rose $1.54, or 1.8 percent, to $86.82 and Apache added $4.46, or 7.6 percent, to $63.39. Tuesday's trading was a partial reversal of the moves investors have made since the presidential election one week ago. Tech stocks have been losing ground recently, but Microsoft picked up $1.14, or 2 percent, to $58.87 and graphics processor maker Nvidia rose $2.55, or 3 percent, to $86.19. Bond prices edged higher, sending long-term interest rates slightly lower. Bond prices had fallen sharply since the election over worries that President-elect Donald Trump's spending plans would lead to higher inflation. That had sent yields to their highest levels this year. But the yield on the 10-year Treasury note declined to 2.23 percent from 2.27 percent. Companies that pay large dividends, like phone companies, also changed course and rose. However the dollar continued to get stronger and reached its highest level in almost a year. It rose to 109.32 yen from 108.51 yen. The euro slid to $1.0718 from $1.0726. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway bought stock in United Continental, American Airlines and Delta. Buffett has avoided the volatile industry in the past, but his holding company disclosed stakes in each company in a form filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. United picked up $3.12, or 5 percent, to $66.06 and American gained $1.36, or 3.1 percent, to $44.76. Aerospace giant Boeing fell after United said that it will postpone delivery of 61 new Boeing 737 jets that it planned to buy. It will convert the orders to a new, more fuel-efficient model that Boeing calls the 737 Max. Boeing stock lost $1.88, or 1.3 percent, to $148.11. Retail sales climbed 0.8 percent in October as consumers spent more money on products including cars and home and garden supplies. Retail sales over last two months have been the strongest in more than two years, which shows consumers are still spending. The report showed continued gains for online retailers. Amazon jumped $24.17, or 3.4 percent, to $743.24 while department stores traded lower as they continued to lose sales. Equity One will combine with Regency Center in a deal that combines two real estate investment trusts that own shopping centers. The two companies have more than 400 properties, most of them anchored by grocery stores. Equity One climbed $1.90, or 6.8 percent, to $29.77 while Regency Center lost $2.95, or 4.2 percent, to $66.91. Chinese e-commerce company JD.com climbed after it reported strong quarterly results. The company also said it might reorganize its JD Finance unit, which runs its internet finance business. JD.com said expects to sell its stake in the company and that JD Finance will be owned solely by Chinese investors. The stock climbed $2.70, or 11.4 percent, to $26.41. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 6 cents, or 4.5 percent, to $1.34 a gallon. Heating oil picked up 6 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $1.44 a gallon. Natural gas lost 4 cents to $2.71 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold rose $2.80 to $1,224.50 an ounce. Silver picked up 15 cents to $17.04 an ounce, while copper gave up 2 cents to $2.51 a pound. Britain's FTSE 100 index rose 0.6 percent and the CAC-40 in France was also 0.6 percent higher. Germany's DAX gained 0.4 percent. Seoul's Kospi shed 0.3 percent and the Nikkei 225 in Japan finished little changed. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.5 percent.

(NYSE: JPM) after a sharp move higher. He added that he would also consider a short position in the name, using options. He explained that JPMorgan has moved 14 percent in the last 5 days, compared to a move of 7 percent in Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE: XLF). Kelly believes that it might pullback after it outperformed its peers significantly and he wants to buy the February 75/67.50 put spread for $1.55. The trade breaks even at $73.45 or 7.45 percent lower and it can make a maximal profit of $5.95. Posted-In: Todd Gordon Trading NationOptions Markets Media © 2016 Benzinga.com.

"Spoke to @realDonaldTrump. Steve Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross are being considered for Treasury and Commerce. Both would be great choices," Icahn wrote on Twitter. (http://bit.ly/2f1fbaP) Icahn, a close ally of Trump who was often praised by the Republican during the presidential campaign for his business acumen, also tweeted that both Mnuchin and Ross were friends and "two of the smartest people I know." Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner and Trump's campaign finance manager, has been considered a front-runner for the Treasury post for much of the past week since Trump's stunning election victory. Mnuchin's inclusion in Trump's campaign team was questioned at the time by Stephen Bannon, now Trump's chief White House strategist. In an interview on Breitbart News, Bannon asked Trump whether the then presidential candidate was "selling out to Wall Street". The list to head the Treasury Department has also included JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon and Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee. Hensarling has said he would prefer to focus on a revamp of financial regulation, while Dimon, a lifelong Democrat, has denied interest in the job in the past. Ross, a billionaire investor, is a part of Trump's economic advisory team. Calls to Ross were not immediately returned. INTO THE TOWER Mnuchin walked through the Trump Tower lobby in Manhattan on Tuesday morning. He would not comment on personnel decisions but said the Trump team is "making sure we get the biggest tax bill passed, the biggest tax changes since Reagan. So a lot of exciting things in the first 100 days of the Trump presidency." With Republicans retaining majorities in Congress, Trump will have a clearer shot at enacting major tax cut and reform legislation and rolling back the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulation law passed in the wake of the financial crisis. The new treasury secretary would play a key role in crafting such legislation, as well as managing potential new debt issuance of as much as $1 trillion if Congress agrees to Trump's proposed infrastructure spending program. With such high stakes, Wall Street is more focused on the selection of the next treasury chief than it was during President Barack Obama's choices for the post. "This time will be different," Gregory Peters, senior investment officer at Prudential Fixed Income, said Tuesday at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit in New York. "That role takes on greater importance." Unlike current Secretary Jacob Lew, who is viewed investors to have taken a lower profile focused largely on international issues over the past year, the next Treasury secretary is expected to be a featured player in articulating and executing the Trump administration's new economic policies and initiatives. A figure such as Mnuchin, with Wall Street experience, might be seen as better equipped to manage the relationship between Treasury and the banks that facilitate U.S. debt issuance. The last Wall Street insider to serve in the post was Henry Paulson, the former Goldman Sachs CEO appointed by George W. Bush and whose term was dominated by the bank bailouts of the 2008 financial crisis. Mnuchin, whose father was also a Goldman Sachs partner, worked at the investment bank for nearly two decades starting in the mid-1980s, a time when Wall Street was developing major financial innovations including new securitization techniques and collateralized debt obligations -- instruments that would later contribute to the financial crisis. In 2009, he led a group of investors that purchased the assets of failed California-based mortgage lender IndyMac, for $1.55 billion that included a loss-sharing deal with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. After rehabilitating the operation and rebranding it as OneWest Bank, they sold it in 2014 for $3.4 billion to CIT Group Inc for $3.4 billion.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 16 November 2016 | MYT 4:08 AM Incoming Nasdaq CEO says Trump policies may benefit Wall Street People are reflected in a display showing the Nasdaq average of the US outside a brokerage in Tokyo. - Reuters pic NEW YORK: Nasdaq Inc’s incoming chief executive officer, Adena Friedman, said on Tuesday that President-elect Donald Trump’s economic policies may boost trading and allow banks to take more risks, including lending more to businesses. Nasdaq on Monday announced Friedman, currently president and chief operating officer, would replace long-time CEO Robert Greifeld in January, making her one of the most powerful women on Wall Street. She said regulations following the 2008 financial crisis meant to reduce risk-taking by banks were well intentioned, but that some may have gone too far. She called for a more “balanced approach to regulation.” “There are elements of the regulation that we are living with today that have hampered the ability for banks to provide an important role in providing liquidity into the markets,” Friedman said at a JPMorgan Chase & Co investor conference. Those rules have not only hurt trading volumes but hindered lending to small- and medium-sized businesses, she said. Trump promised during his campaign to slash taxes and regulation, including the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reforms aimed at curbing risk taking by banks and protecting consumers, which he said makes it hard for banks to loan money. Provisions of Dodd-Frank included the Volcker Rule, which restricts speculative investments by banks, and the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to police areas like mortgage servicing, debt collection and payday lending. Trump adviser Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge-fund industry executive, has said that Dodd-Frank would be reviewed and “the worst anti-business parts of it will be gutted.” Mary Jo White, outgoing chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), said on Tuesday she would not want to see parts of Dodd-Frank, including the Volcker Rule, rescinded or repealed. The SEC does not have evidence that the rules have affected market liquidity, she said in testimony to the House Financial Services Committee. White said on Monday she planned to depart the SEC around the same time President Barack Obama leaves the White House. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Stocks , Nasdaq Inc , Donald Trump Related Stories One Mexican firm to ride on Trump’s construction boom Trump's election win not good news for Malaysian chipmakers Stock markets’ Trump rally runs out of steam Bursa stages rebound Global capital markets rattled You May Be Interested Tan & Tan: Brand is as important as location Soft luxury condominium market prevails The gig economy only a stopgap measure to our woes The curse of self-serving directors Stocks falter; euro hits dollar low for year Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read India all out for 204, England need 405 to win The floor’s his forte US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 Property Related advertisement Latest News A ‘Yan’ to be the best Inevitable, essential failure Reflections on Budget 2017 Briefs Too premature to make final decision on TPP, says Mustapa Most Viewed in Business Governor: Bank Negara won’t tolerate ringgit transactions in NDF market PNB unit trust funds hit 210.63 billion units as of October Too premature to make final decision on TPP, says Mustapa advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Prices of oil turned fell back after an overnight rally. KEEPING SCORE: Japan’s Nikkei jumped 1.1 percent to 17,865.61 and South Korea’s Kospi gained 0.7 percent to 1,981.80.

Australia’s S&P/ASX added 0.1 percent to 5,330.40, while markets in Taiwan, Singapore and Southeast Asia were stronger. ANALYST’S TAKE: “International markets showed signs of pausing to wait on evidence of policy specifics before extending moves in the direction of the ‘Trump themes’ of fiscal stimulus and inflation,” Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said in a daily commentary. OIL: Oil prices rallied overnight on hopes that OPEC members would agree to lower output when they meet later this month. But they fell back during Asian trading hours.

Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 12 cents to $46.83 a barrel in London. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks finished higher on Tuesday as a rally in the oil markets pushed energy companies higher. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.3 percent to 18,923.06.

Energy and technology stocks jump, sending US indexes higher Associated Press | NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are climbing Tuesday as the price of oil makes its biggest jump in seven months, sending energy companies higher. Big technology stocks, which have been mostly left out of a post-election rally, turned sharply higher. Microsoft, Facebook and Google's parent company, Alphabet, all posted solid gains. Bank stocks, which had soared over the past week, gave back some of those gains. Bond prices edged higher, sending long-term interest rates slightly lower. Bond prices had fallen sharply since the election over worries that President-elect Donald Trump's spending plans would lead to higher inflation. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average picked up 27 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,895 as of 3:10 p.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 14 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,178. The Nasdaq composite added 62 points, or 1.2 percent, to 5,280. ENERGY: Energy companies led the market higher as investors once again grew hopeful that the OPEC cartel will agree to cut fuel production. Later this month representatives of the OPEC nations will try to complete a deal that would lower their output and strengthen oil prices. Benchmark U.S. crude gained $2.49, or 5.7 percent, to $45.81 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose $2.52, or 5.7 percent, to $46.95 a barrel in London. Among energy stocks, Exxon Mobil rose $1.38, or 1.6 percent, to $86.67 and Apache added $4.12, or 7 percent, to $63.05. CHANGING COURSE: Tuesday's trading was a partial reversal of the moves investors have made since the presidential election one week ago. Tech stocks have been losing ground recently, but Microsoft picked up $1.41, or 2.4 percent, to $59.14 and graphics processor maker Nvidia rose $2.56, or 3.1 percent, to $86.20.. Bond prices rose and yields, which have reached their highest levels this year, slipped. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note declined to 2.23 percent from 2.27 percent. Companies that pay large dividends, like phone companies, also changed course and rose. Banks returned some of their recent gains. JPMorgan Chase fell 68 cents to $78.83 and Wells Fargo gave up 93 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $52.29. THE QUOTE: "The market somehow decided 'let's give the Trump presidency a chance," said John DeClue, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank's private client reserve. However DeClue said the bond market could struggle with Trump in the White House: if taxes are cut and government spending rises sharply, that could lead to climbing deficits that would trouble investors in U.S. government debt. SHOPPING DEAL: Equity One will combine with Regency Center in a deal that combines two real estate investment trusts that own shopping centers. The two companies have more than 400 properties, most of them anchored by grocery stores. Equity One climbed $2.02, or 7.2 percent, to $29.89 while Regency Center lost $2.73, or 3.9 percent, to $67.13. BUFFET BUYS AIRLINES: Billionaire investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway bought stock in United Continental and American Airlines. Buffett has avoided the volatile industry in the past, but his holding company disclosed stakes in each company in a form filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. United picked up $2.97, or 4.7 percent, to $65.91 and American gained $1.40, or 3.2 percent, to $44.80. GROUNDED: Aerospace giant Boeing fell after United said that it will postpone delivery of 61 new Boeing 737 jets that it planned to buy. It will convert the orders to a new, more fuel-efficient model that Boeing calls the 737 Max. Boeing stock lost $1.35 to $148.64. RETAIL DETAILS: Retail sales climbed 0.8 percent in October as consumers spent more money on cars and home and garden supplies, among other types of products. Retail sales over last two months have been the strongest in more than two years, which shows consumers are still spending and the economy might grow more quickly in the fourth quarter than economists expect. The report showed continued gains for online retailers. Amazon jumped $26.93, or 3.7 percent, to $746 while department stores traded lower as they continued to lose sales. JD DEALING: Chinese e-commerce company JD.com climbed after it reported strong quarterly results. The company also said it might reorganize its JD Finance unit, which runs its internet finance business. JD.com said expects to sell its stake in the company and that JD Finance will be owned solely by Chinese investors. The stock climbed $2.91, or 12.3 percent, to $26.62. UNPRINTABLE: 3D printer maker Stratasys tumbled after its profit and sales fell far short of estimates. The stock shed $3.13, or 15.3 percent, to $17.37.

Consumer spending up heading into holiday shopping season Christopher S. Rugaber, AP 12:16 p.m. EST November 15, 2016 In this Friday, Oct. 21, 2016, file photograph, Sara Judge, left, manager of the Dam Store, located at the mouth of the Big Thompson Canyon, helps customer Jessica Wiechman, right, from West Point, Neb., with a purchase, in Loveland, Colo. On Tuesday, Nov. 15, 2016, the Commerce Department reports on retail sales for October. (Michael Brian/Loveland Reporter-Herald via AP, File) (Photo: AP) WASHINGTON - American consumers ramped up their spending last month in a sign of robust health heading into the crucial holiday shopping season. Retail sales rose 0.8 percent in October, after an upwardly-revised 1 percent gain in September, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. The two-month increase was the largest since the spring of 2014. The numbers suggest that the economy may grow more quickly in the final three months of the year than many economists had expected. Retail sales are closely watched as a sign of consumer health. Consumer spending makes up about 70 percent of the economy. Steady hiring and emerging signs of solid pay increases have made Americans more confident and willing to spend. The unemployment rate fell last month to a low 4.9 percent and in October, workers saw the biggest annual pay gain since the end of the recession. And while many companies, such as Dunkin Donuts, blamed their own weak sales figures in the late summer and fall on consumer concerns surrounding the election, Tuesday’s figures show that the presidential campaign had little impact overall. “If electoral uncertainty were restraining activity prior to last Tuesday, it is nowhere apparent in the consumer spending data,” JPMorgan Chase economist Michael Feroli said. Revisions to September and August data indicate that consumers spent more than previously estimated in the July-September quarter, Feroli said. That means growth in the third quarter may have been as high as 3.2 percent, he estimated, above the 2.9 percent figure reported last month. Some of the biggest sales increases were in autos and gas, with higher prices boosting gas station sales. Even excluding those categories, however, sales rose 0.6 percent in October and 0.5 percent the previous month. Auto sales rose a healthy 1.1 percent, though many dealers relied on steep discounts. Sales of home and garden supplies also rose 1.1 percent in October, a positive sign that more Americans are remodeling and expanding their homes. Home Depot, the nation’s biggest home improvement chain, upped its outlook for the year Tuesday after beating Wall Street expectations handily. Customer transactions jumped, as did the amount they spent on each visit, the company said. Most other retailers also saw healthy increases: Grocery stores, health and personal care outlets, sporting goods retailers, clothing stores, and online and catalog retailers all reported strong sales. Online and catalog retailers are continuing to seize market share from older-line outlets such as department stores. Online and catalog sales have increased 12.9 percent in the past year, much faster than the 4.3 percent gain for all retailers. Department stores, meanwhile, have seen their sales plunge 7.3 percent in the past 12 months. Furniture stores were one of the few to report a drop in October, with sales falling 0.9 percent. Steady hiring may be boosting spending. Employers have added about 175,000 jobs a month this year, down from last year’s pace but still enough to push unemployment even lower over time. That appears to be boosting consumer confidence, which has been mostly healthy in recent months. A measure of consumer sentiment by the University of Michigan rose in the first half of November. Even with solid growth in the October-December quarter, the economy has been weak this year. It expanded at just a 1.1 percent pace in the first six months of 2016. It accelerated to a 2.9 percent pace in the July-September quarter. Even with a healthier expansion in the fourth quarter, growth may not reach 2 percent for the full year.

Energy companies lead indexes higher as oil price soars Associated Press | 0 comments NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks climbed Tuesday as the price of oil made its biggest jump in seven months and energy companies rose with it. Technology stocks like Microsoft and Google's parent Alphabet traded higher and bond yields slipped, a break with the pattern since last week's election. Oil rose almost 6 percent as investors once again grew hopeful that the OPEC cartel will agree to cut fuel production in a few weeks. Companies like utilities and telecom service providers climbed as bond yields fell slightly after a week of large gains. Airlines rose after Warren Buffett made a surprise investment in three carriers. "The market somehow decided 'let's give the Trump presidency a chance," said John DeClue, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank's private client reserve. However DeClue said the bond market could struggle with Trump in the White House: if taxes are cut and government spending rises sharply, that could lead to climbing deficits that would trouble investors in U.S. government debt. The Dow Jones industrial average picked up 54.37 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,923.06, as those gains were partly held back by losses for retailer Home Depot and aerospace company Boeing. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 16.19 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,180.39. The Nasdaq composite added 57.22 points, or 1.1 percent, to 5,275.62. Energy companies like Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum made large gains as the price of oil rose by the largest amount since early April. At least for a day, investors were hopeful that the nations of OPEC will be able to hammer out a deal to cut oil production, which would boost prices. OPEC agreed to a preliminary deal in September but still have to work out important details. Benchmark U.S. crude gained $2.49, or 5.7 percent, to $45.81 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose $2.52, or 5.7 percent, to $46.95 a barrel in London. Exxon rose $1.54, or 1.8 percent, to $86.82 and Apache added $4.46, or 7.6 percent, to $63.39. Tuesday's trading was a partial reversal of the moves investors have made since the presidential election one week ago. Tech stocks have been losing ground recently, but Microsoft picked up $1.14, or 2 percent, to $58.87 and graphics processor maker Nvidia rose $2.55, or 3 percent, to $86.19. Bond prices edged higher, sending long-term interest rates slightly lower. Bond prices had fallen sharply since the election over worries that President-elect Donald Trump's spending plans would lead to higher inflation. That had sent yields to their highest levels this year. But the yield on the 10-year Treasury note declined to 2.23 percent from 2.27 percent. Companies that pay large dividends, like phone companies, also changed course and rose. However the dollar continued to get stronger and reached its highest level in almost a year. It rose to 109.32 yen from 108.51 yen. The euro slid to $1.0718 from $1.0726. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway bought stock in United Continental, American Airlines and Delta. Buffett has avoided the volatile industry in the past, but his holding company disclosed stakes in each company in a form filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. United picked up $3.12, or 5 percent, to $66.06 and American gained $1.36, or 3.1 percent, to $44.76. Aerospace giant Boeing fell after United said that it will postpone delivery of 61 new Boeing 737 jets that it planned to buy. It will convert the orders to a new, more fuel-efficient model that Boeing calls the 737 Max. Boeing stock lost $1.88, or 1.3 percent, to $148.11. Retail sales climbed 0.8 percent in October as consumers spent more money on products including cars and home and garden supplies. Retail sales over last two months have been the strongest in more than two years, which shows consumers are still spending. The report showed continued gains for online retailers. Amazon jumped $24.17, or 3.4 percent, to $743.24 while department stores traded lower as they continued to lose sales. Equity One will combine with Regency Center in a deal that combines two real estate investment trusts that own shopping centers. The two companies have more than 400 properties, most of them anchored by grocery stores. Equity One climbed $1.90, or 6.8 percent, to $29.77 while Regency Center lost $2.95, or 4.2 percent, to $66.91. Chinese e-commerce company JD.com climbed after it reported strong quarterly results. The company also said it might reorganize its JD Finance unit, which runs its internet finance business. JD.com said expects to sell its stake in the company and that JD Finance will be owned solely by Chinese investors. The stock climbed $2.70, or 11.4 percent, to $26.41. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 6 cents, or 4.5 percent, to $1.34 a gallon. Heating oil picked up 6 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $1.44 a gallon. Natural gas lost 4 cents to $2.71 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold rose $2.80 to $1,224.50 an ounce. Silver picked up 15 cents to $17.04 an ounce, while copper gave up 2 cents to $2.51 a pound. Britain's FTSE 100 index rose 0.6 percent and the CAC-40 in France was also 0.6 percent higher. Germany's DAX gained 0.4 percent. Seoul's Kospi shed 0.3 percent and the Nikkei 225 in Japan finished little changed. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.5 percent. ____ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay © 2016 The Associated Press.

Rugaber, The Associated Press Tuesday, Nov. 15, 2016 at 9:25 AM | Comments: 0 Print E–mail Tweet Report Error WASHINGTON - American consumers ramped up their spending last month in a sign of robust health heading into the crucial holiday shopping season. Retail sales rose 0.8 per cent in October, after an upwardly-revised 1 per cent gain in September, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. The two-month increase was the largest since the spring of 2014. The numbers suggest that the economy may grow more quickly in the final three months of the year than many economists had expected. Retail sales are closely watched as a sign of consumer health. Consumer spending makes up about 70 per cent of the economy. Steady hiring and emerging signs of solid pay increases have made Americans more confident and willing to spend. The unemployment rate fell last month to a low 4.9 per cent and in October, workers saw the biggest annual pay gain since the end of the recession. And while many companies, such as Dunkin Donuts, blamed their own weak sales figures in the late summer and fall on consumer concerns surrounding the election, Tuesday's figures show that the presidential campaign had little impact overall. "If electoral uncertainty were restraining activity prior to last Tuesday, it is nowhere apparent in the consumer spending data," JPMorgan Chase economist Michael Feroli said. Revisions to September and August data indicate that consumers spent more than previously estimated in the July-September quarter, Feroli said. That means growth in the third quarter may have been as high as 3.2 per cent, he estimated, above the 2.9 per cent figure reported last month. Some of the biggest sales increases were in autos and gas, with higher prices boosting gas station sales. Even excluding those categories, however, sales rose 0.6 per cent in October and 0.5 per cent the previous month. Auto sales rose a healthy 1.1 per cent, though many dealers relied on steep discounts. Sales of home and garden supplies also rose 1.1 per cent in October, a positive sign that more Americans are remodeling and expanding their homes. Home Depot, the nation's biggest home improvement chain, upped its outlook for the year Tuesday after beating Wall Street expectations handily. Customer transactions jumped, as did the amount they spent on each visit, the company said. Most other retailers also saw healthy increases: Grocery stores, health and personal care outlets, sporting goods retailers, clothing stores, and online and catalogue retailers all reported strong sales. Online and catalogue retailers are continuing to seize market share from older-line outlets such as department stores. Online and catalogue sales have increased 12.9 per cent in the past year, much faster than the 4.3 per cent gain for all retailers. Department stores, meanwhile, have seen their sales plunge 7.3 per cent in the past 12 months. Furniture stores were one of the few to report a drop in October, with sales falling 0.9 per cent. Steady hiring may be boosting spending. Employers have added about 175,000 jobs a month this year, down from last year's pace but still enough to push unemployment even lower over time. That appears to be boosting consumer confidence, which has been mostly healthy in recent months. A measure of consumer sentiment by the University of Michigan rose in the first half of November. Even with solid growth in the October-December quarter, the economy has been weak this year. It expanded at just a 1.1 per cent pace in the first six months of 2016. It accelerated to a 2.9 per cent pace in the July-September quarter. Even with a healthier expansion in the fourth quarter, growth may not reach 2 per cent for the full year.

Rugaber, The Associated Press   0 WASHINGTON – American consumers ramped up their spending last month in a sign of robust health heading into the crucial holiday shopping season. Retail sales rose 0.8 per cent in October, after an upwardly-revised 1 per cent gain in September, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. The two-month increase was the largest since the spring of 2014. The numbers suggest that the economy may grow more quickly in the final three months of the year than many economists had expected. Retail sales are closely watched as a sign of consumer health. Consumer spending makes up about 70 per cent of the economy. Steady hiring and emerging signs of solid pay increases have made Americans more confident and willing to spend. The unemployment rate fell last month to a low 4.9 per cent and in October, workers saw the biggest annual pay gain since the end of the recession. And while many companies, such as Dunkin Donuts, blamed their own weak sales figures in the late summer and fall on consumer concerns surrounding the election, Tuesday’s figures show that the presidential campaign had little impact overall. “If electoral uncertainty were restraining activity prior to last Tuesday, it is nowhere apparent in the consumer spending data,” JPMorgan Chase economist Michael Feroli said. Revisions to September and August data indicate that consumers spent more than previously estimated in the July-September quarter, Feroli said. That means growth in the third quarter may have been as high as 3.2 per cent, he estimated, above the 2.9 per cent figure reported last month. Some of the biggest sales increases were in autos and gas, with higher prices boosting gas station sales. Even excluding those categories, however, sales rose 0.6 per cent in October and 0.5 per cent the previous month. Auto sales rose a healthy 1.1 per cent, though many dealers relied on steep discounts. Sales of home and garden supplies also rose 1.1 per cent in October, a positive sign that more Americans are remodeling and expanding their homes. Home Depot, the nation’s biggest home improvement chain, upped its outlook for the year Tuesday after beating Wall Street expectations handily. Customer transactions jumped, as did the amount they spent on each visit, the company said. Most other retailers also saw healthy increases: Grocery stores, health and personal care outlets, sporting goods retailers, clothing stores, and online and catalogue retailers all reported strong sales. Online and catalogue retailers are continuing to seize market share from older-line outlets such as department stores. Online and catalogue sales have increased 12.9 per cent in the past year, much faster than the 4.3 per cent gain for all retailers. Department stores, meanwhile, have seen their sales plunge 7.3 per cent in the past 12 months. Furniture stores were one of the few to report a drop in October, with sales falling 0.9 per cent. Steady hiring may be boosting spending. Employers have added about 175,000 jobs a month this year, down from last year’s pace but still enough to push unemployment even lower over time. That appears to be boosting consumer confidence, which has been mostly healthy in recent months. A measure of consumer sentiment by the University of Michigan rose in the first half of November. Even with solid growth in the October-December quarter, the economy has been weak this year. It expanded at just a 1.1 per cent pace in the first six months of 2016. It accelerated to a 2.9 per cent pace in the July-September quarter. Even with a healthier expansion in the fourth quarter, growth may not reach 2 per cent for the full year. shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Leave a comment Cancel reply Sign in to comment.

Slideshow PhillyDeals: Protecting technology start-ups from media giants Advertisment of Gallery: Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon The Internet was supposed to plug everyone in and bring us all close. Same for cable TV, regular television, radio, movies, and telephones. But each time, inventors and prophets of the new technologies were bought out and pushed aside by business empire-builders, backed by JPMorgan and other Wall Street banks - with government blessing. These hard-driving bosses crowded out new competitors, and built national franchises to supply mass-produced information products and services at profitable prices, writes Columbia University professor Tim Wu, in his fast-moving history The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires. At least the monopolists who ran AT&T and RCA, and the Jewish immigrant movie producers who dominated "Golden Age" Hollywood, self-censoring to please Catholic activists, felt an obligation to give the masses high-quality programs, Wu writes. That trade-off enabled AT&T to suppress messaging and mobile technologies, just as RCA boss David Sarnoff delayed FM radio and stole blueprints from the early pioneers of television, Wu writes. Eventually, disruptive new technologies win financial backing and crack the monopolies, sometimes with government help, as under President Richard Nixon. Then the cycle repeats. Wu distrusts the Comcast-NBC Universal merger, the musical romance of AT&T and Apple (Wu contends their early partnership made them the arbiters of the music business), and the long-term intentions of Google. Wu doesn't call for detailed regulation. He suggests a simple business separation among the owners of content, media systems, and the tools we use to read or watch. That's not what's happening. Yet upstart attempts to challenge the media empires can be found, for example, in North Philadelphia.   Beyond DVDs "Why can't we stream movies from studios to people, right now?" asks Tom Ashley, an Art Institute of Philadelphia graduate and sometime feature director. His new firm, FlixFling, is based at his film-distribution business and soundstage, Invincible Pictures, in a block-long former mail-sorting facility at Fifth and Oxford. Ashley and his staff built Invincible by buying new horror movies, documentaries, and other independent productions cheap, then promoting them through arthouse and multiplex screenings and DVD sales. But the rapid decline in DVD use, as rental, cable, smartphone, and Internet-access services and Netflix made it easier to watch movies online, forced him to look at new ways of reaching fans. "We saw inherent problems with the Netflix model" as it regards customer access, Ashley told me. "Netflix, Comcast, Apple, all these companies, they are very big on digital-rights management issues. They look at controlling the world, instead of opening it up. "There's too many rules, too many restrictions. For example, to use any Xfinity pictures, you have to be a Comcast subscriber. I think it's a narrow approach." Instead, FlixFling offers a "digital locker," streaming access to movies stored on public servers, at a few dollars per view. "We haven't done any marketing, and we've already had 20,000 downloads of our iPhone-iPad [application], and close to 30,000 of our Google Android version," at a few dollars each, "and 6,000 registered pay-as-you-go users," paying a few dollars per movie, Ashley says. Ashley's financial backer is Brad Heffler, an accountant by trade, a sometime Hollywood investor and the founder of Claims Compensation Bureau, a 15-year-old Conshohocken firm that manages class-action lawsuits and other legal records. "Creatively, he's amazing," Heffler says of Ashley. "He needed some business direction. I saw a good fit." Can start-ups such as FlixFling challenge Netflix and the cable and video giants? "Consumers want content when they want it and how they want it - at the lowest price," says Tom Ara, entertainment-industry lawyer at the Los Angeles firm Manatt, Phelps & Phillips L.L.P. He has represented FlixFling in talks with studios. "In the music industry, the record companies resisted, and they found 'resistance is futile,' to quote Star Trek," Ara said. But Wu's book is full of attractive start-ups that were bought, exploited, or suppressed by the giants of each era. If FlixFling works, won't some media imperialist take it over? "I see this as another opportunity to grow a small start-up company into a real player in the industry," Heffler told me. "I anticipate we'll be approached. But our goal right now is to grow it. And get a lot of subscribers, and have a place for independent filmmakers to show movies they can't get out [otherwise]" through today's media empires.   Contact columnist Joseph N.

Growth in the number of workers joining the gig economy has slowed and wages for these jobs have declined in the last two years, according to a new study from the JPMorgan Chase Institute. Slowing growth is happening both at companies that let people sell or lease assets — like eBay and Airbnb — as well as ones that connect workers with part-time jobs — like Uber, Lyft or TaskRabbit — the study found. For the average worker, dwindling paychecks are the new reality. "More and more people are coming in but the earnings levels are not growing. It just raises these questions about whether this is really a sustainable marketplace for people," said Laura Greig, director of consumer research at the institute. The study looked at deposits made into the checking accounts of more than 240,000 anonymized customers who made money from online platforms between October 2012 and June 2016. Its findings reinforced those of a report released in February. In 2014, monthly participation in online labor platforms was growing by more than 300 percent year over year. In June 2016, it grew by just 103 percent on an annualized basis, the study found. For most of 2014, growth in participation on other online platforms — those that let people making money by renting or selling things — was more than 100 percent year over year, but flatlined starting in the middle of 2015, said Greig. Overall, in June, less than 1 percent of the customers studied earned money through any sort of online platform company. The study also found huge turnover in this part of the economy: 1 in 6 participants is new every month, on average, and more than half of the people who sign up quit within a year. "There's a ton of churn," said Greig. By comparison, the median length of employment in a traditional job was more than four years in January 2016, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Lower levels of attrition may be attributable to things like benefits and career development opportunities associated with traditional jobs, the study noted. People getting work on these platforms are also getting less money. Average monthly earnings for workers on labor platforms have decreased 6 percent since June 2014. This coincided with cuts by some companies, as they dropped prices to compete for customers and passed along some of those losses to workers. It may also reflect the fact that, on average, workers clocked fewer hours. Earnings varied greatly from city to city, the study found. For example, in June, the average labor platform worker at the top end in New York was $2,447 per month, while in Miami the average monthly worker made just $585 per month. At the same time, fewer new participants are signing up. New workers' earnings dropped from 29 percent in July 2014 to 16 percent in June 2016. New people renting or selling assets dropped from 59 percent to 16 percent over the same period. As the overall job market has improved, the pool of people likely to use online platforms to make money has narrowed, the study found. Unemployed people use these platforms less than employed people, and are more likely to stick at it for over a year.

His first cabinet nominee is Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions for attorney-general. The Republican lawmaker is known for his hardline positions on immigration and was one of few senators to actively campaign on Mr. Trump’s behalf. Mr. Sessions will need to be confirmed by the Senate. Mr. Trump’s more controversial picks – retired general Michael Flynn as national security adviser and anti-establishment conservative Stephen Bannon as chief strategist – do not need Senate approval. Mr. Trump’s other supporters are also expected to land big positions in his administration, including former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. The real estate mogul’s eldest children and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, are part of the transition team. Mr. Kushner is reportedly trying to figure out how to circumvent federal anti-nepotism laws so that he can serve in his father-in-law’s administration. All cabinet nominations require Senate confirmation and Mr. Trump’s choices may not all win approval. Republicans only control the Senate by two votes and several opposed Mr. Trump during the campaign. Here’s a look at Mr. Trump’s appointees and who may fill the key positions in his White House. White House advisers ALEX WONG/GETTY IMAGES Stephen Bannon: The appointment of Mr. Bannon as Mr. Trump’s chief strategist sounded alarm bells across the political spectrum and among hate-watch groups. The head of the right-wing website Breitbart News has called it “the platform for the alt-right,” or the white nationalist, anti-Semitic movement that supports Mr. Trump. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors and exposes hate groups, said Mr. Bannon propelled Breitbart to become a white nationalist propaganda mill and called on the Trump team to rescind the hire. The choice of Mr. Bannon appeared to placate Mr. Trump’s anti establishment base. Mr. Bannon is known for ripping into mainstream Republicans such as House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell. Reince Priebus: The Republican National Committee chairman was one of Mr. Trump’s most devoted soldiers. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Priebus took heat from mainstream Republicans for defending Mr. Trump’s actions. Mr. Priebus threatened Republicans who did not fall in line with Mr. Trump and his loyalty earned him the position of chief of staff. Mr. Priebus has ties with long serving Republicans such as House Speaker Paul Ryan, which will help smooth relations between the White House and congressional Republicans. Corey Lewandowski: When Mr. Lewandowski was Mr. Trump’s campaign manager during the primaries, he believed it was best to “let Trump be Trump.” He was eventually fired amid assault allegations and concerns he could not run a national campaign. But Mr. Lewandowski was steadfastly loyal and continued to advise Mr. Trump while being paid by CNN to provide political commentary. Jared Kushner: Mr. Trump’s son-in-law was one of Mr. Trump’s prominent advisers during the campaign and is part of the transition team. He reportedly pushed his father-in-law to choose Mike Pence as his running mate. Mr. Kushner also helped mastermind the campaign’s decision to bring Bill Clinton’s sexual abuse accusers to the second debate, in an effort to shake Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Michael Flynn: The retired general will serve as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, a role he played on the campaign. Mr. Flynn was one of the only high-level defence officials to openly support Mr. Trump. He served as the Obama administration’s Defense Intelligence Agency director before being fired in 2014 for what he said was the “stand I took on radical Islamism.” Mr. Flynn’s anti-Muslim rhetoric is reflected in Mr. Trump’s call to ban Muslims from entering the United States. Earlier this year, the retired general tweeted: “Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL.” His position does not need Senate approval. Trump’s transition team faces setbacks after departure of Mike Rogers President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team suffered its second upheaval in less than a week amid a power struggle to influence the shape of the incoming administration. (Return to table of contents) Treasury Has someone been picked yet? No BRYAN R. SMITH/AFP/GETTY IMAGES Mr. Trump rode to victory on a wave of populism but is considering Wall Street types and a long serving Republican lawmaker for the country’s top economic job. Whoever is picked will help implement tax cuts and fulfill Trump’s campaign promises to create 25-million jobs and save factory jobs that have been lost to globalization. Steven Mnuchin: The hedge fund manager and former Goldman Sachs banker was Mr. Trump’s campaign finance manager, an economic adviser to Mr. Trump, and part of the president-elect’s transition team. Wilbur Ross: The billionaire investor is chairman of Invesco Ltd. subsidiary WL Ross & Co. He and Mr. Ross might also be in the running for the commerce secretary job (see below). Jamie Dimon: The CEO of JPMorgan Chase was one of the few bank heads who emerged from the 2007-09 financial crisis with his reputation relatively intact. His record has since taken a hit amid the bank’s multi-billion-dollar trading loss. Jeb Hensarling: As chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, the Republican lawmaker has repeatedly tried to repeal the massive Dodd-Frank financial regulation law. Mr. Trump’s views on regulation are aligned with the Republican Party, but recently there has been speculation that Mr. Trump only wants to overturn parts of the law. Fed chair’s job complicated by Trump’s victory Economic policies of the president-elect are best described as ‘inflationary,’ making an interest rate increase a near certainty, David Parkinson explains.

No ZORAN IVANOVICH/iSTOCKPHOTO The commerce department describes the secretary’s mission as being “the voice of U.S. business within the president’s cabinet,” focusing on job creation and domestic business. Wilbur Ross: The billionaire investor was reported to be in the running in a tweet by billionaire Carl Icahn, who claimed to have just spoken with Mr. Trump. Steven Mnuchin: Mr. Icahn also named Mr. Mnuchin, Mr. Trump’s campaign finance manager and economic adviser, as a possible commerce secretary candidate. (Return to table of contents) Secretary of State Has someone been picked yet? No BRENNAN LINSLEY/ASSOCIATED PRESS The country’s top diplomat will have the tricky job of forging new relations with America’s allies after Mr. Trump questioned whether the U.S. should honour its commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and praised dictators such as North Korea’s Kim Jong-un and Russia’s Vladimir Putin. The state department also has oversight over the Keystone XL pipeline, which the Obama administration rejected. Mr. Trump and Republicans agree the pipeline, which would run from Alberta to Texas once fully completed, should be built. Rudy Giuliani: A former New York mayor and associate attorney-general in Ronald Reagan’s administration, Mr. Giuliani was one of Mr. Trump’s most vocal supporters. But consulting work for foreign governments by his firm, Giuliani Partners, has put him under added scrutiny for the State Department job. The firm helped businesses on behalf of states including Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, and Mr. Giuliani also advised TransCanada, which sought to build the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. Newt Gingrich: The former House speaker spent two decades as a lawmaker. After he was forced to resign as speaker in 1998, he dabbled in lobbying, ran a consulting firm and unsuccessfully ran for president. He attached himself to the Trump campaign early on, providing advice and defending the real estate mogul’s actions. John Bolton: A former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Mr. Bolton has years of foreign policy experience, but he has raised eyebrows with some of his hawkish positions, including a 2015 New York Times op-ed in which he advocated bombing Iran to halt the country’s nuclear program. Bob Corker: Republican senator from Tennessee and chairman of the upper chamber’s foreign relations committee. The countries that will gain and lose from Trump's presidency Following a U.S. presidential election that has affected more than just the United States – in both negative and positive ways – some world leaders are scrambling to figure out, what now? Mark MacKinnon explains. (Return to table of contents) CIA director Has someone been picked yet? Yes JASON REED/REUTERS Espionage and cybersecurity played an outsized role in the 2016 election, with Washington blaming Russian hackers for an attack on Democratic National Committee servers and Donald Trump inviting Moscow, apparently in jest, to do more hacking to uncover Hillary Clinton’s e-mails. Mr. Trump faced criticism from former national-security officials during the campaign, and in choosing who to lead America’s intelligence agencies, Mr. Trump faces an uphill battle in winning the security establishment’s trust. Mike Pompeo: On Nov. 18, the Trump transition team announced Mr. Pompeo, a GOP congressman from Kansas, had been offered and accepted the nomination for the CIA directorship. Mr. Pompeo originally backed Marco Rubio for the Republican nomination, but is reportedly close with vice-president-elect Mike Pence. (Return to table of contents) Trade Has someone been picked yet? No DARRYL DYCK/THE CANADIAN PRESS Mr. Trump has blamed the North American free-trade agreement and U.S.-Chinese trade policies for eliminating high paying jobs in the United States. He has vowed to rip up NAFTA and label China a currency manipulator. The president-elect’s position on trade won him the support from working class voters, which in turn helped flip Democratic-leaning states Republican. So far, Canada’s ambassador to the United States has said Canada is open to renegotiating NAFTA. Dan DiMicco: The former chief executive of steel producer Nucor Corp. has been talked about as a possible trade representative in the Trump administration.

(Return to table of contents) Homeland Security Has someone been picked yet? No CHUCK BURTON/ASSOCIATED PRESS This is expected to be one of the key portfolios in the Trump administration. Mr. Trump kicked off his campaign promising to get Mexico to pay for a wall between their two countries. He said he would deport the 11-million undocumented immigrants living in the United States and has said he would ban Muslims from entering the country. However, his position has wavered throughout the campaign. His latest comments called for the deportation or jailing of what he called three million undocumented immigrants with criminal records. Mr. Trump’s supporters have cited illegal immigration as their top issue and they will be watching his administration carefully to ensure he follows through on his promises. David Clarke: The African-American law enforcement veteran made a name for himself by criticizing the Black Lives Matter movement, calling it “Black Lies Matter” and saying the activists would join forces with the Islamic State. During the campaign, the Milwaukee County Sheriff told supporters in a tweet that it was “pitchforks and torches” time. (Return to table of contents) Interior Has someone been picked yet?

Other reported possibilities: Jan Brewer, former Arizona governor; Forrest Lucas, founder of oil products company Lucas Oil; Harold Hamm, CEO of Continental Resources Inc.; Robert Grady, venture capitalist, partner in private equity firm Gryphon Investors. Campbell Clark: Thanks to Trump, Trudeau’s calculus on climate no longer adds up For all the questions about what Mr. Trump will do as president, one thing is pretty clear: He won’t advance climate change policies. (Return to table of contents) Secretary of defence Has someone been picked yet? No ASSOCIATED PRESS The Trump administration will have to deal with the rise in terrorism at home and abroad. Mr. Trump’s policies to fight terrorism and defeat Islamic State are vague. Initially, Mr. Trump said he knew more about IS than the generals and then said his plan would entail asking the military to devise a plan within 30 days to destroy Islamic State. Part of his plan is to temporarily ban immigration from certain regions that have a “history of exporting terrorism,” though he has not identified the regions. Some reported possibilities: Stephen Hadley, former national security adviser under President George W. Bush; Jon Kyl, former senator from Arizona; Duncan Hunter, representative from California and member of the House Armed Services Committee; Jim Talent, former Missouri senator who was on the Senate Armed Services Committee; Kelly Ayotte, outgoing senator from New Hampshire and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Trump win puts pressure on Ottawa to boost military spending U.S. leaders have tried to nudge Canada to do more in NATO for decades, but the Trump administration may escalate that, Steven Chase explains. (Return to table of contents) Attorney-general Has someone been picked yet? Yes BLUESTOCKING/iSTOCKPHOTO The country’s top lawyer and chief law enforcer will be instrumental in carrying out Mr. Trump’s promises to bring back “law and order” to the country. Mr. Trump also vowed to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Ms. Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server when she served as secretary of state. This raised concerns that Mr. Trump would use the powers of his office to go after his rivals. However, Mr. Trump appears to have softened his position, saying that the Clintons were good people and that he did not want to hurt them. Jeff Sessions: A Trump transition-team official said on Nov. 18 that U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions has accepted Trump’s offer to serve as attorney-general, Reuters reported. The Alabama lawmaker is a member of the judiciary committee and is known for his hardline positions on immigration. Mr. Sessions was one of the few Republican senators to actively campaign on Mr. Trump’s behalf. 'It will be devastating': Women’s rights at risk under Trump presidency Though he has voiced a pro-choice position in the past, his campaign – and the men surrounding him now – has women worrying about the president-elect, Erin Anderssen explains.

Under previous administrations, the department was also responsible for stopping the spread of nuclear weapons.

Reported possibilities: Harold Hamm, CEO of Continental Resources Inc.; Kevin Cramer, North Dakota congressman; Robert Grady, venture capitalist, partner in private equity firm Gryphon Investors; Larry Nichols, co-founder of Devon Energy Corp.; James Connaughton, CEO of Nautilus Data Technologies and a former environmental adviser to president George W.

Jordan Wathen (TMFValueMagnet) Nov 15, 2016 at 8:31AM Image source: Getty Images Bank stocks are rarely the market's best performers. You probably shouldn't want them to be if you've held them for a long time. The best years typically follow particularly bad years, which is the case for two of 2016's best banks.  So far, 2016 has been especially good for smaller banks, as a popular regional banking index is up about 22% year to date. Some have have done even better. Hancock Holding Company (NASDAQ:HBHC), Chemical Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:CHFC), and Cullen/Frost Bankers (NYSE:CFR) have made the most of 2016. The worst performer of the three is up 43% this year, nearly twice the return of its peer group.  Here's an introduction to 2016's best bank stocks, and why they're flying higher. Banking along the Gulf Hancock Holding Company operates nearly 200 branches along the Gulf of Mexico. In the booming days of domestic oil production, the company's bankers got ahead of themselves, making loans across the energy industry. Energy loans, which made up 13% of its loan book two years ago, now make up just 8.7% of its loan portfolio. It spent the better part of 2016 building up a substantial reserve against loan losses and now carries an allowance that amounts to 8.6% of its energy loans. In other words, it could lose about $0.09 of every dollar deployed in energy loans and take no further hits to its balance sheet. Of course, direct energy exposure is only one slice of the pie. Hancock Holding Company has some indirect energy exposure in the form of commercial real estate loans in Houston. On a recent conference call, management indicated that it felt good about the prospects for getting repaid, noting few ill effects of lower oil prices and rents. The market is increasingly viewing Hancock's problematic energy loans to be a problem of the past. With bolstered reserves and reduced exposure, shares recently topped $38, a level not seen since 2010, gaining nearly 55% this year. Making a mint in Michigan Chemical Financial Corporation operates under the names Chemical Bank (not to be confused with JPMorgan Chase's predecessor) and Talmer Bank and Trust, with 255 branches in Michigan, Ohio, and surrounding areas. It is most competitive in Michigan's smaller towns, including Midland, Clare, and Bay City, areas where it reported having 67%, 43%, and 29% of bank deposit market share, respectively, before a recent acquisition. Chemical Financial is an acquisitive company. It closed on the acquisition of Talmer in the third quarter, which immediately brought the bank to eastern Michigan and Ohio. Two rivals, Huntington Bancshares and FirstMerit Corp., also merged this year, giving the new Huntington Bancshares more branches in the same geographic footprint. On a recent conference call, management noted that it expected one-time costs associated with the merger to taper off through the second quarter of 2017, which would then allow for the combined earnings power to flow through to shareholders. A presentation called for its efficiency ratio -- non-interest expenses as a percentage of revenue -- to be as low as 55% after the integration is complete, which is excellent for a regional bank. Notably, its 2016 performance was compounded by the bank rally following Trump's presidential win. Its post-election gain of 13% tops the others on this list, who saw their shares swell by 10%. In all, shares have gained about 47% year to date in 2016. A Texan titan The rise in Cullen/Frost Bankers' share price has been remarkable, as shares are up nearly 100% from their 2016 low, and about 43% year to date. A true oil bank, Cullen/Frost has seen its share price largely followed the price of oil this year, up and down. The energy businesses that fueled its loan growth are now taking a back seat. Cullen/Frost recently reported that 12% of its loans were to energy-related companies, down from 15.3% in December 2015. Its commercial real estate loan portfolio has some additional worrisome exposure to Houston, amounting to about 8% of total loans. But where loans make up the vast majority of most banks' balance sheets, Cullen/Frost Bankers is an exception. Its loan and securities portfolios are roughly similarly sized, and thus it can afford larger losses on loans than the prototypical bank. Cullen/Frost charged off its biggest losers in the second quarter of 2016, reporting a net charge-off ratio of 0.74% during the period. In the third quarter of 2016, charge-offs fell to 0.17% of loans, closer to its average charge-off rate in periods of high oil prices and economic growth. Management indicated on the second-quarter conference call that it expected charge-offs to normalize through the remainder of the year. So far, they have. A recent regulatory stress test suggested the bank is on solid footing. The test concluded that Cullen/Frost would remain well capitalized -- and profitable -- in a significant economic downturn in which unemployment spikes to 10%, the stock market drops 51%, and commercial real estate prices drop 30%, among other worrisome assumptions. Beefier loan reserves, higher oil prices, and declining charge-off expectations have helped buoy shares this year.   Jordan Wathen has no position in any stocks mentioned.

PrintCommentRecommend (-) By The Morningstar Ultimate Stock-Pickers Team | 11-15-16 | 06:00 AM | Email Article By Eric Compton | Stock Analyst For the past eight years, our primary goal with the Ultimate Stock-Pickers concept has been to uncover investment ideas that not only reflect the most recent transactions of our grouping of top investment managers but are timely enough for investors to get some value from them. In cross-checking the most current valuation work and opinions of Morningstar's own cadre of stock analysts against the actions (or inactions) of some of the best equity managers in the business (see the full roster here), we hope to uncover a few good ideas each quarter that investors can dig into a bit deeper to see if they warrant a long-term commitment. About the Author Ultimate Stock-Pickers layers Morningstar's own stock recommendations over a cross-section of great investors' stock picks to uncover enticing opportunities. For more, visit the Ultimate Stock-Pickers homepage and sign up for Ultimate Stock-Pickers e-mail alerts. Contact Author | Meet other investing specialists With close to three fourths of our Ultimate Stock-Pickers having reported their holdings for the third quarter of 2016, we have a sense of the stocks that piqued their interest during the period. While the story of the fourth quarter will be how well our top managers positioned their portfolios in the run-up to and aftermath of the election, the story of the third quarter was one where the markets were largely calm (relative to the disruption caused by the Brexit vote in late June). As such, it was no surprise to see the level of buying activity during the most recent period being more tepid than it has been in past periods. In fact, while the number of top managers making new-money purchases did increase slightly during the period, many of the positions that were initiated were small, with no single security seeing more than one fund making a conviction, new-money buy. And as has been the case during the first two quarters of the year, our top managers were net sellers during the most recent period. For those that may not recall, when we look at the buying activity of our Ultimate Stock-Pickers, we focus on both high-conviction purchases and new-money buys. We think of high-conviction purchases as instances where managers have made meaningful additions to their portfolios, as defined by the size of the purchase in relation to the size of the portfolio. We define a new-money buy strictly as an instance where a manager purchases a stock that did not exist in the portfolio in the prior period. New-money buys may be done either with or without conviction, depending on the size of the purchase, and a conviction buy can be a new-money purchase if the holding is new to the portfolio. We also recognize that the decision to purchase any of the securities we are highlighting in this article could have been made as early as the start of July, with the prices paid by our managers being much different from today's trading levels. As such, it is important for investors to assess the current attractiveness of any security mentioned here by checking it against some of the key valuation metrics—like the Morningstar Rating for Stocks and the price/fair value estimate ratio—that are generated regularly by our stock analysts' ongoing research efforts. Looking more closely at the top 10 high-conviction purchases during the third quarter of 2016, the buying activity was again well spread out among different sectors. This time around there were two Financial Services names, two Technology names, and two names each from the Consumer Cyclical and Consumer Defensive sectors. Not too surprisingly, given the track record of our top managers, most of the buying activity during the period was focused on high-quality names with defendable economic moats—exemplified by the greater number of wide- and narrow-moat names in the list of top 10 high-conviction purchases. Top 10 High-Conviction Purchases made by Our Ultimate Stock-Pickers There was also a decent amount of crossover between our two top 10 lists this quarter, with six of the names—wide-moat rated Analog Devices and Walt Disney , narrow-moat rated Danaher and JPMorgan Chase , on top of Walgreens Boots and Ally Financial —present on both lists. Notably, Walt Disney was a new-money name being purchased with conviction by a couple of our top managers. Top 10 New-Money Purchases made by Our Ultimate Stock-Pickers On a separate note, there was a larger number of 2- and 3-star rated names on both lists, no doubt affected somewhat by the post-election rally in the markets. While there is always room for disagreement on the prospects of an individual firm, the fact that the overall buying activity of our top managers continued to decrease (with the group being net sellers once again) and valuations seem to be stretched signals to us that caution is warranted. Keeping this in mind, there were still a few names that caught our eye as being worthy of further consideration by investors. Wide-moat rated Walt Disney was the only 5-star rated stock on our top 10 lists. We highlighted Disney last quarter, noting that  Parnassus Core Equity Investor had initiated a new position in the name with conviction. This past quarter, Parnassus continued to add to its position, making another high-conviction purchase of the name, while two other managers initiated positions. In fact,  Columbia Dividend Income and  American Funds American Mutual both made new money purchases, with the purchase by Columbia Dividend also being a conviction buy. Unfortunately, none of the managers of these funds mentioned Disney in their quarterly commentaries. Disney shares have been in a slump since late 2015. Morningstar analyst Neil Macker believes this sell-off has only created an opportunity for investors and continues to view shares of Disney as undervalued. Critics have consistently underestimated Disney's ability to fully monetize key assets in ways no other competitor can and often with a vision that most only see after the fact. The Pixar acquisition, which many felt was overpriced, turned into a financial and strategic home run. The acquisition of the Marvel franchise has also fared well, and the latest success of the Star Wars franchise, another acquired asset, has proven yet again the power of Disney's brand and varied platforms, which include movies, home video, merchandise, theme parks, and even musicals. In addition to its Disney-branded businesses, the firm also owns powerful media networks, including ESPN and ABC. ESPN is unrivaled in sports television, both in content and profitability, and the channel is a must have for television bundles. With so much going for Disney, it can be hard to see what could go wrong, but there are threats emerging. One major change taking place in the media environment is the switch from cable and traditional distribution networks to over-the-top distribution, where content is offered over the Internet, outside of the formal distribution channels. While this could be problematic in theory, Macker argues that it will be the content owners who still win in the long run. From this viewpoint, Disney is still immensely valuable because of all of the historical content it owns and all of the future content it is likely to produce. While many firms, such as Netflix and Amazon, are producing their own original content, Macker believes Disney's portfolio will still be profitable and quite enviable for years to come. Competition has also been heating up in the sports network arena, with new entrants and pressure on the traditional cable business suggesting the best times may be over. However, Macker argues that ESPN still has the most attractive portfolio of sports rights, and its history of being able to consistently increase fees should allow the channel to retain its position as the dominant sports network. These fee increases should also help cushion any losses of subscribers in the future. Disney recently reported fiscal fourth-quarter results, and while some may view them as disappointing given the firm's 10% decline in its EBITDA, Macker points to fiscal 2018 and beyond, where there should be a very strong slate of films including four Marvel films, three animated movies, and two Star Wars films. ESPN should also benefit from the proliferation of new over-the-top pay TV providers such as DirecTV Now. Macker sees average top-line growth of roughly 5% through 2020, with operating margins improving 80 basis points to 24.8% by 2020. Shares currently trade at a 27% discount to Macker's fair value estimate of $134, with the company expected to buy back $7 billion-$8 billion of stock in the near term. Apple and Twenty-First Century Fox were the only other stocks on our top 10 lists that were appealing from a valuation perspective. We've covered Apple quite a few times in the past, with the shares even catching the attention of the investment managers at wide-moat rated Berkshire Hathaway this year. The stock has appreciated off its since its mid-May lows, gaining 25% through the end of September. Since our last series of articles, Apple reported fiscal fourth-quarter results, and the shares retreated somewhat, but Morningstar analyst Brian Colello has maintained his $133 fair value estimate and positive overall view of the firm. Parnassus Core Equity Investor was one of two managers buying Apple with conviction this quarter, and had the following to say about the firm: Apple had a great [third] quarter, as its stock rose 18.3% to $113.05 from $95.60 and boosted the Fund's return by 58 basis points. The stock moved higher as signs indicated that the recent iPhone 7 launch would beat investor expectations. We continue to admire Apple's competitive position, ability to innovate, and vibrant ecosystem, so we've held onto the stock even as it's moved higher. Colello also likes Apple's competitive positioning, awarding the firm a narrow economic moat, with a positive moat trend. Colello notes that there are minimal switching costs associated with smartphones, as all of these devices can perform most necessary functions—such as placing calls, sending texts, browsing the web, running apps, and so on—but believes that Apple has done a much better job at trying to develop switching costs than many of its peers. He believes that Apple's switching cost advantages arise from its iOS operating system, and appear to be increasing thanks to iCloud and other native services. While many complain that innovation has declined since Tim Cook took over as CEO, Colello believes the firm is still innovating, with the introductions of Apple Pay, Apple Watch, and Apple TV standing out. He also notes that Apple recently held a product launch event that featured substantial upgrades to its Macbook Pro lineup as well as a new TV viewing guide app for the Apple TV box and iOS devices. Colello believes the Mac and TV demonstrations showed that Apple continues to move the ball forward on the integration of hardware and software, with innovation at the company being far from dead. More importantly, Colello sees the firm maintaining the loyalty of its massive iPhone user base. Apple reported fiscal fourth-quarter results last month. The biggest near-term issue Colello saw in the period was the supply constraints around the higher-priced iPhone 7 Plus, which will weigh on gross margins in the near term (and likely contributed to the fall in Apple's stock price post earnings). While the company's current revenue forecast is not indicative of tremendous iPhone unit or revenue growth, Colello's long-term valuation for Apple hinges on a steady iPhone business with repeat device sales made to loyal customers, buffeted by the switching cost advantage provided by the iOS ecosystem. In this context, Apple's results gave Colello confidence that his thesis remains intact. Twenty-First Century Fox had the greatest number of funds buying with conviction during the most recent period, as Yacktman ,  FMI Large Cap , and  Dodge & Cox Stock were all buying shares. Yacktman, which made the highest conviction purchase, and currently has the most exposure to the name among all of our top managers, had the following to say about the firm: We think Fox is significantly undervalued, in part because of underappreciated businesses like Star, which provides nearly 25% of television content in India, equity affiliates that include Fox's 39% ownership of Sky, and non-controlling ownership stakes in Hulu and Endemol Shine. In total, we think Star, Sky, and the other affiliate stakes could represent more than $10 per share of value while contributing only modestly to earnings. After adjusting for our appraisal of these underappreciated assets, we think the core of Fox trades for only 8-9 times earnings. Morningstar analyst Neil Macker believes Twenty-First Century Fox enjoys strong competitive advantages based on its worldwide cable networks and its film and television studios. Just as the ever increasing importance of quality content will benefit Disney in the future, Macker sees it benefitting Fox, which owns robust film franchises and a strong television production studio (producing such prime-time hits as Modern Family, the X-Men movie series, and more). In addition to this, the firm also own Fox News and broadcasting rights for the NFL, college football, and MLB as well as the international cable assets Yacktman highlighted. Macker believes that the combination of an established and growing broadcast network and the ownership of valuable content assets give Fox a wide moat. That said, investors should keep in mind that Fox is heavily dependent on advertising revenue for its network profitability, and the operating leverage of building out and maintaining these networks remains high. While content will continue to be valuable, Fox is also exposed to some of the viewing preference shifts that are taking place, which affect the networks more than pure play content providers. Helping to counteract some of this is Fox's exposure to still expanding emerging and developing markets, like Asia. With the stock trading at a 23% discount to his fair value estimate of $35 per share, Macker believes there is a decent enough margin of safety for investors to consider the name. Among the more fairly valued names that showed up on our top 10 lists this time around, Danaher, Walgreens, and JP Morgan saw some of the highest conviction buying activity, but in each case, it was a single manager making the purchase. For Danaher, the managers at  AMG Managers Montag & Caldwell Growth made a high-conviction, new-money purchase during the period, with Ronald Canakaris having the following to say about the name: A new position was established in Danaher, a provider of professional, medical, industrial, and commercial products and services, typically characterized by strong brand names, innovative technology, and market-leading positions. The company continuously drives revenue and cost improvements utilizing Kaizen business practices and should benefit from accretion from the recently completed acquisition of Pall Corp. The company became more focused on the faster growing healthcare market following the spin-off of Fortive, businesses that were more exposed to industrial end markets. Celgene was increased as we believe the stock was attractively valued, and we expect solid earnings growth. Danaher follows a unique business model for a public company. It is essentially a conglomerate that grows through significant M&A, overhauls the acquired assets using Danaher's management system, and counts on the superiority of that system so that Danaher creates more value from the acquired assets than the previous owners did, all while not overpaying. As one might guess, this strategy relies heavily on the capital allocation and managerial acumen of upper management. Morningstar analyst Michael Waterhouse believes that Danaher has some unique benefits and that a focus on innovation within more niche areas has helped lead to sticky relationships and strong brand reputation. While Danaher competes in many different business lines, after its latest spin-off the firm is more concentrated in healthcare—being a major player in life science, diagnostic, and dental markets. The Kaizen business practices mentioned by Montag & Caldwell refer to a business model developed originally in Japan that focuses on continual improvement. A bet on Danaher is largely a bet on its management and its ability to make wise M&A moves and to better manage the assets it does own as well as those it acquires in the future. Waterhouse believes the shares are slightly overvalued right now and that investors may do better to wait for more attractive prices.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases pr @ satprnews.com 360insights Names Tim Rochon CTO as it Launches Consumer Rebates Module for Channel Success Platform™ Former VP of Information Technology at Loblaw Companies to help guide growth of industry-first channel marketing software platform for global consumer brands WHITBY, Ontario–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Unveiling today a new consumer rebate and management module for its Channel Success Platform™ – the world’s first cloud-based sales and marketing incentives software platform – 360insights also announced that it has hired former Loblaw Companies Limited VP of Information Technology Tim Rochon as its Chief Technology Officer (CTO). “With his uniquely powerful combination of business and technology acumen, Tim is the ideal person to lead our future technology vision across an increasing number of market segments,” says 360insights founder and CEO Jason Atkins. “He has a strong track record of leading the vision, development and implementation of customer- and technology-driven innovation.” Rochon is a seasoned information technology and marketing systems manager with more than 20 years of leadership experience in the Canadian retail and financial services sectors, including senior roles at Loblaw, Shoppers Drug Mart, JP Morgan Chase, Sears Canada and CIBC. His role at 360insights is to lead the product development team in its mission to deliver best-in-class, software-based user experiences and business intelligence to the global brands served by 360insights. 360insights, previously known as 360incentives, has grown its business model as a cloud-based channel incentives platform underpinned by a robust state-of-the-art insights analytics engine. Its Channel Success Platform™ shifts the focus from channel program management to channel optimization, delivering for its clients’ higher integrity, data-driven, predictive decisions on where and how they direct their channel marketing spend. Rebates Module The latest development in the 360insights’ Channel Success Platform™ is the enhanced Rebates Module, which enables product manufacturers and marketers who offer promotional rebates to consumers, to deliver the most compelling consumer experience possible with the industry’s best online and mobile claim submission platform. Capitalizing on a multiplicity of consumer touchpoints, the 360insights Rebates Module delivers a transformational rebate experience to consumers and helps marketers increase lifetime customer value by giving them the analytical tools to understand, predict and act on real-world consumer behaviors. The reality is that most consumer rebate programs do not realize their full potential. Customers are often cynical, submissions are cumbersome and the redemption process can be frustrating. Even after the rebate is completed, marketers have no way to measure the results and effectiveness of the promotion. Lost is the opportunity to learn more about the consumer and ensure that the last impression of the brand with them is a good one. “Consumer product companies need to advance their traditional channel marketing practices in order to build brand advocates, make intelligent data-driven decisions and ensure the rebate transaction is a springboard for future brand loyalty, customer retention and increased market share,” Rochon says. “The enhanced Rebates Module we’re launching today enables all that to happen by connecting manufacturers, dealers, sales associates and consumers with a digitized rebate management solution that is seamless, brand-consistent and user-focused from end-to-end,” he says. “It is also the first module enhancement of many more to come that will elevate the value of the Channel Success Platform™.” ABOUT 360insights 360insights.com is the originator of the Channel Success Platform™, the first truly integrated software-as-a-service platform to enable brands to optimize their partner marketing and consumer incentive spend. Based in Whitby, Ontario, the company serves over 100 of the world’s top brands and has expanded to have operations around the USA and UK. In the past year, 360insights has raised over $40 million in private investment capital to accelerate the global growth and adoption of the Channel Success Platform™. With a company culture built around the simple concept of happiness, the company was awarded Employer of the Year honors in the Toronto Region Board of Trade’s 2016 Business Excellence Awards and has been recognized multiple times as one of Canada’s Best Small to Medium Employers.

Investors know what that cocktail produces. It boosts growth, at least for a while, and it generates inflation. Even famed liberal economist Paul Krugman has switched from predicting an imminent global recession. “Don’t be surprised if economic growth actually accelerates for a couple of years,” he says, because the “dire effects of Trumpism” will take time to become manifest. In the bond market, a mini-rout is under way as yields on government debt climb across the board. US 1o-year Treasuries were yielding 1.35% in the summer and 1.85% on the eve of Trump’s victory; now they are 2.19%, a huge move in such a short space of time. In the UK, the 10-year gilt yield, which fell as low as 0.5% in the same summer lull, is now 1.4%. Related: Global bonds slump as Trump prompts inflation fears A return of more normal yields, encouraged by the prospect of fiscal stimulus and higher rates of growth, is just what the world has been crying out for, many at both ends of the political spectrum would agree. Years of near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing haven’t rebooted the global economy, so try something different. Well, yes, but let’s not pretend that such fiscal medicine is risk-free, especially when taken in the dosage Trump intends. A cut in the business tax rate from 35% to 15%, and $550bn to be spent on new infrastructure, represent crisis-style responses. But, as JP Morgan’s chief global strategist David Kelly argues, the idea that the US is massively underperforming its potential for growth and requires a big fiscal stimulus is wrong. The US economy is at virtual full employment and the federal budget deficit is already rising. Indeed, the US Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated in September that Trump’s plans for massive personal and corporate tax cuts plus more defence spending would push the US national debt to 105% of GDP by 2026, against 77% currently and 86% assumed for 2026 under current laws. “The truth is, boosting the federal debt to these levels is fiscally reckless,” argues Kelly. The inflationary impact of a spending spree looks likely to be even more severe if the US is simultaneously blocking skilled immigration and imposing 1930s-style trade tariffs around the world. A big boom followed by an almighty bust? That script seems very plausible. Nor should we surprised if there are accidents on the way. In the early days of quantitative easing, central banks used to warn us that the exit from the bond bubble they created would have to be managed carefully because of its capacity to destabilise the financial system. You can understand why they worried: if government debt, supposedly the safest form of asset, is suddenly imposing double-digit losses on holders, there will be consequences. Prepare to see them soon: the bond bubble has been 30 years in the making and it won’t deflate painlessly. William Hill back in the race after failed merger It should not be news that a gambling company is appointing to its board some non-executives with experience of the gambling industry. It is at William Hill, where the boardroom is currently populated by non-specialists, a shortcoming that was cruelly exposed when shareholders shot down the board’s half-baked idea of exploring a £4.6bn merger with Amaya, a Canadian online poker company. John O’Reilly, formerly of Ladbrokes and Coral, and Mark Brooker, former chief operating officer at Betfair, will improve the board’s gambling quota from zero to two. Robin Terrell, a former digital wizard for Tesco, also looks a sensible hire. Gareth Davis, chairman for the past six years, did not explain why the obvious gap in expertise had not been filled previously but he has heard the criticisms and responded, which may quell the calls for his own departure. Full rehabilitation will depend on the two other factors. First, the company needs to avoid further trading upsets while Davis completes his search for a chief executive to relieve Philip Bowman, whose own lack of a gambling background makes him an imperfect candidate. On that front, news that full-year operating profits are still expected to arrive towards the top of a £260m to £280m range gets a tick. The other factor will be evidence that William Hill won’t have its head turned by the next flashy Amaya-style proposal. The new boardroom appointments suggest self-help is indeed the priority again. Good, but the path to this point should not have been so roundabout.

That’s according to a calculation by Forbes, which found that Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan, got the largest windfall from the bank rally last week, with his holdings increasing $69.8 million since Trump won the election. Dimon benefited from reports that Trump was considering him for the role of Treasury Secretary when he is sworn in this coming January. Coming in second was Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, who has seen his stock and options increase $63.9 million, with shares gaining 10 percent since Trump won. Meanwhile, James Gorman, CEO of Morgan Stanley, has seen his fortune rise $10.4 million. Even embattled Wells Fargo got a boost this week with its new CEO, Tim Sloan, increasing his own coffers by $8.3 million. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan saw his fortunes increase $5.4 million, while Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat’s holdings increased $1.3 million. According to the report, the lift in shares of the bank stocks comes as Wall Street is betting Trump will pass big infrastructure and defense spending bills that could kick up economic growth. Also helping is the steepening of the yield curve with the spread between the two- and 10-year Treasury note steepening 25 basis points since Election Day. Earlier this week, CNBC, which cited two people familiar with the matter, reported advisers of Trump have suggested Dimon for the next Treasury Secretary. CNBC noted that one source said Dimon would not want to take on the job. CNBC noted that Dimon has said over and over that he wouldn’t want to become Treasury Secretary. CNBC said it’s not clear which advisor is urging Trump to consider Dimon. The report pointed out that Steven Mnuchin, formerly of Goldman Sachs, is seen as the leading person for the job. Separately, The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported Trump’s advisers are also looking at Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-TX) as a potential pick for the Treasury Secretary job. According to WSJ, Hensarling has a free market background and lots of ties to Republicans. Hensarling is the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and has gone after Republican-favored priorities, like getting rid of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law.

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ US stocks closed little changed on Monday after rising dramatically the week before and a decline in the technology sector offset a steep rise in financial stocks as investors bet on higher interest rates. After choppy trading late in the session, the Dow ended at a record high while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite dipped. "I think all we're doing is trimming our sails a little from the violently positive rally we had post-election results last week," said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has been under pressure since the Nov. 8 election as investors poured money into sectors such as financials, industrials and energy, which are seen benefiting from President-elect Donald Trump's policies. The financial index rose 2.3 per cent, with banks including Bank of America JPMorgan providing the biggest boost. The index has risen 10.8 per cent since the election on hopes of deregulation and higher interest rates. While the financial rally gained steam, the S&P technology index closed down 1.7 per cent, leading the decliners. The index has fallen 3 per cent since the election. Apple fell 2.5 per cent and weighed the most on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, followed by Facebook and Microsoft. Since technology valuations have soared in recent years, investors are switching money to sectors such as banks, which has been relatively cheaper but should now benefit from rising interest rates, said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Investors have been betting technology will look relatively less attractive if Trump lives up to his promise to review regulation in healthcare and financial sectors and to increase government spending on infrastructure to boost economic growth. "If growth becomes more even and available, we may see a continuation of rotation into lower-valuation, more cyclical businesses and out of high-valuation growth stocks like technology," said James Abate, chief investment officer at Centre Asset Management in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 21.03 points, or 0.11 per cent, to 18,868.69, the S&P 500 lost 0.25 points, or 0.01 per cent, to 2,164.2 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 18.72 points, or 0.36 per cent, to 5,218.40. The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates at its December meeting, with traders pricing in a 91-per cent chance, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. The industrial index finished up 0.4 per cent, buoyed by prospects for increased infrastructure outlays. Harman International rose 25.2 per cent to $109.72 after Samsung Electronics announced an $8 billion deal to buy the company. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.44-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 82 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 423 new highs and 31 new lows. About 10 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges on Monday, far above the 7.7 billion average for the previous 20 sessions.

EQY, +0.61% today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement (“Agreement”) under which Equity One will merge with and into Regency, with Regency continuing as the surviving public company and creating the preeminent shopping center Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”). The resulting enterprise will have industry-leading operating, development, redevelopment capacities as well as an unparalleled portfolio of primarily grocery-anchored properties uniquely positioned to sustain growth in net operating income (“NOI”) and create value for all of its stakeholders. The combined company is expected to have a pro forma equity market capitalization of approximately $11.7 billion and a total market capitalization of $15.6 billion, making it the largest REIT by equity value in the shopping center index. “Bringing together these two highly complementary businesses creates a best-in-class platform capable of delivering sustained growth and value creation over the long-term,” said Martin E. “Hap” Stein, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Regency. “Shareholders of both companies are poised to benefit from an expanded presence in top metro areas, a higher organic growth profile, expanded development and redevelopment program, and greater tenant diversity. Through this transaction we are creating the nation’s preeminent shopping center REIT with excellent embedded growth potential. Importantly, we expect the transaction to be accretive to core FFO per share while preserving a sector-leading balance sheet, with greater financial flexibility to support growth initiatives.” “This merger will be a transformative event for both companies,” said David Lukes, Chief Executive Officer of Equity One. “The alignment of our respective portfolios, development/redevelopment pipelines, industry-leading operations, and access to a lower cost of capital, opens us to new avenues of growth that will benefit all shareholders. Equity One shareholders are receiving an attractive valuation for the company’s assets, and have the opportunity to participate in the future growth prospects of a powerful new company led by a best-in-class management team.” Under the terms of the Agreement, each share of Equity One common stock will be converted into 0.45 shares of newly issued shares of Regency common stock. On a pro forma basis, following the closing of the transaction, Regency shareholders are expected to own approximately 62 percent of the combined company’s equity, and former Equity One shareholders are expected to own approximately 38 percent. The merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of both Regency and Equity One shareholders. The parties currently expect the transaction to close during the first quarter or early second quarter of 2017. This strategic transaction was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of both companies. The merger will create a national portfolio of 429 properties encompassing more than 57 million square feet, including co-investment partnerships, and located primarily in high density in-fill and affluent trade areas. The combination will provide increased penetration within key target areas, broader tenant diversity, and meaningful balance sheet capacity. As a result, the combined company will feature the attributes necessary to deliver consistent NOI growth, along with the capabilities to pursue accretive capital deployment opportunities through disciplined development and intense asset management. Summary of Strategic Benefits The merger of Regency and Equity One uniquely positions the combined company to enhance shareholder value as the preeminent grocery-anchored shopping center REIT: Unparalleled Portfolio of High-Quality Centers: Increased concentration in higher density, in-fill metro areas. The company’s five largest areas of Southern and Northern California; Southeast Florida; New York; and the Washington / Baltimore corridor, which together will represent more than 50 percent of total annualized rent, increases density by more than 30 percent and demographic purchasing power by 15 percent. Enhanced NOI Growth Profile: The high quality of the combined platform provides for significant and sustainable embedded NOI and net asset value growth opportunities. Expanded Value-Creation Opportunities: The combined best-in-class national development, redevelopment, and leasing platform is positioned to produce industry-leading performance. Greater Diversity of High-Quality Tenants: The top 10 tenants of the combined company, which include category-leading grocers and retailers such as Publix, Kroger, Whole Foods, and TJX, will represent approximately 18 percent of total ABR, with no single tenant representing more than approximately three percent. Superior Financial Strength and Flexibility: With enhanced size and scale, the combined company will maintain a conservative balance sheet with the flexibility to pursue compelling investment opportunities. Annualized Operating Cost Savings: The combined company expects to realize approximately $27 million in annual run-rate cost savings by 2018, primarily related to the elimination of duplicative corporate and property-level operating costs. In addition, the combined company expects to realize additional synergies from economies of scale, increased operational efficiencies and its ability to augment an already-talented team. Leadership and Organization Both the Board of Directors of Regency and the Board of Directors of Equity One unanimously approved the transaction. The number of directors on Regency’s Board of Directors will be increased to 12, of which two directors designated by Equity One and one director designated by Gazit-Globe will be appointed to the Regency Board. Mr. Stein will serve as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the combined company, and Regency’s President and Chief Financial Officer, Lisa Palmer, Executive Vice President of Development, Mac Chandler, and Executive Vice President of Operations, James Thompson, will continue in their respective roles at the combined company. Chaim Katzman, current Chairman of Equity One and Gazit-Globe’s designee on the Regency Board, will serve as non-executive Vice Chairman of the combined company. Gazit-Globe, which owns approximately 34 percent of the outstanding stock of Equity One, has agreed to vote in favor the transaction. John C. Schweitzer will continue to serve in his role as lead director for Regency. Upon completion of the merger, the company’s headquarters will remain in Jacksonville, Florida. The company will retain the Regency name and will continue to trade under the ticker symbol REG (NYSE). Pro Forma Operations and Balance Sheet Both companies own and operate high-quality grocery-anchored shopping centers located in fundamentally strong areas throughout the country. On a pro forma basis, the combined company will have an increased presence in higher-density, in-fill trade areas and enhanced tenant diversification. Given the complementary assets and operations of the two companies, the combined platform has meaningful opportunities for synergies, and margin improvement is expected. The combined company expects to increase cash flow at the property level by marking rents to market rates, realizing contractual rent increases, growing small shop occupancy and re-merchandising. In addition, the combined company is expected to have greater liquidity, a strong investment-grade balance sheet and a well-staggered debt maturity profile supported by long-standing relationships. Dividend Policy and Declaration Each company is expected to continue its ordinary course dividend policy during the pendency of the merger, and will also pay a pro-rated pre-closing dividend, so as to equalize the dividend payment dates and periods for each company. Advisors J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is acting as financial advisor, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz is acting as legal advisor, to Regency. Barclays is acting as lead financial advisor, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. is acting as co-financial advisor, and Kirkland & Ellis LLP is acting as legal advisor to Equity One. ICR, LLC served as communications advisor for the transaction. Conference Call The companies will host a joint conference call on Monday, November 14, 2016 at 7:00 pm EST to discuss the proposed merger. Participants will include Mr. Stein, Regency’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ms. Palmer, Regency’s President and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Lukes, Equity One’s Chief Executive Officer, and Matthew L. Ostrower, Equity One’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

"I smell a trade war. That is what I think this market has become all about," the "Mad Money" host said. Stocks initially rallied last week from the prospects of tax cuts and infrastructure and defense spending. On Monday, however, investors finally realized that President-elect Trump could crack down on trading partners who take advantage of the U.S. market without opening theirs, Cramer said. They are starting to see what it could mean if Trump does more than just talk tough about imports and dumping. Apple shares declined more than 2 percent on Monday, revealing the company's vulnerability to a Trump regime. "Trump has stated repeatedly that Apple should make more products here. Apple might be caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place ... I know the Chinese picked the wrong day to single out Apple," Cramer said. Carlo Allegri | Reuters A ship is unloaded in Miami, Florida. Harman International Industries CEO Dinesh Paliwal told Cramer on Monday that he is thrilled that Samsung Electronics is acquiring the company for $8 billion. "Frankly when we see that the integration of these two companies, when we put it together, this is really dynamite because it's so complimentary," Paliwal said. Shares of Harman skyrocketed 25 percent on the news that Samsung is acquiring the company for $112 per share, a nearly 28 percent premium over where it traded on Friday. It signaled a major push for Samsung into auto-related technology. Moving forward, Paliwal added that he plans to double down in cybersecurity. He believes that the threat has now extended into individuals homes, cars and personal devices. Cyberark Software's CEO Udi Mokady echoed the same sentiment to Cramer on Monday, stating that anything connected to the internet can be hacked. Cyberark is the Israeli cybersecurity company that helps companies to protect administrator and privileged accounts. These are the accounts frequently targeted by hackers with the aim of getting the "keys to the kingdom." Mokady commented on the changing landscape of the cybersecurity industry. "I think in the last couple of years we have seen a change. It's called the post-breach proactive security measure," Mokady said. "We are coming in ahead of time to help secure against these advanced attacks, but we are seeing that the modern day customer is thinking 'OK we will be breached, let's make sure it's contained.'" Ashlee Espinal | CNBC Dinesh Paliwal, Harman International CEO Bank stocks have also rebounded since the presidential election. Cramer noted that all of the signals were there for investors to buy the banks, starting when JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon purchased 500,000 shares in the open market for $26.6 million on Feb. 11. With JPMorgan closing at $79 on Monday, those shares are worth nearly $40 million. "Maybe Dimon was lucky. Maybe he's just good. Either way, he's obviously still optimistic about JPMorgan, or else he would have taken up Trump on his offer to be Treasury secretary," Cramer said. After years of outperformance, the stock of CVS Health suffered a 10-point straight decline last week, leading Jim Cramer to wonder if it is a broken company or merely a broken stock. "CVS has gone from a market darling to a total dog, as its once-vaunted pharmacy benefit manager business has become an albatross around its neck and the company loses share to its rivals," Cramer said. Shares of CVS tripled from the summer of 2011 to the summer of 2015, but then fell into free-fall. They closed at $76 on Monday. The business includes both its 7,800 retail pharmacies, and its pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) segments. "Maybe they can turn things around, but for now, CVS remains in the penalty box until we see them take concrete steps to lessen their dependence on what was once the golden goose, now just a turkey headed for a carving," Cramer said. In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on a few caller favorite stocks: American Tower: "There was a piece out today that Sprint might merge with T-Mobile and everybody decided to dump on American Tower. My thinking is when you get this kind of a move, you've got to wait until tomorrow mid-day because there are so many sellers out there." AmSurg Corp: "This group is under pressure. Everything is so in flux in healthcare because of the new President that we just have to be on the sidelines. It's tough, because it looks so inexpensive. But sidelines is where we have to be."

After choppy trading late in the session, the Dow ended at a record high while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite dipped. “I think all we're doing is trimming our sails a little from the violently positive rally we had post-election results last week,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has been under pressure since the November 8 election as investors poured money into sectors such as financials, industrials and energy, which are seen benefiting from President-elect Donald Trump's policies. The financial index rose 2.3 per cent, with banks including Bank of America JPMorgan providing the biggest boost. The index has risen 10.8 per cent since the election on hopes of deregulation and higher interest rates. While the financial rally gained steam, the S&P technology index closed down 1.7 per cent, leading the decliners. The index has fallen 3 per cent since the election. Apple fell 2.5 per cent and weighed the most on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, followed by Facebook and Microsoft. Since technology valuations have soared in recent years, investors are switching money to sectors such as banks, which has been relatively cheaper but should now benefit from rising interest rates, said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Investors have been betting technology will look relatively less attractive if Trump lives up to his promise to review regulation in healthcare and financial sectors and to increase government spending on infrastructure to boost economic growth. “If growth becomes more even and available, we may see a continuation of rotation into lower-valuation, more cyclical businesses and out of high-valuation growth stocks like technology,” said James Abate, chief investment officer at Centre Asset Management in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 21.03 points, or 0.11 per cent, to 18,868.69, the S&P 500 lost 0.25 points, or 0.01 per cent, to 2,164.2 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 18.72 points, or 0.36 per cent, to 5,218.40. The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates at its December meeting, with traders pricing in a 91-per cent chance, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. The industrial index finished up 0.4 per cent, buoyed by prospects for increased infrastructure outlays. Harman International rose 25.2 per cent to US$109.72 (RM476.31) after Samsung Electronics announced an $8 billion deal to buy the company. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.44-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 82 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 423 new highs and 31 new lows. About 10 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges yesterday, far above the 7.7 billion average for the previous 20 sessions. ― Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Asia to narrow trade focus as protectionism rises, say analysts Five ways Indians are dodging ‘black money’ crackdown Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Palm oil celebrates centennial, output doubles every 10 years TPP, RCEP, FTAAP: A user’s guide to alphabet soup of trade deals Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Bank Negara instructs foreign banks to refrain from offshore ringgit trading, sources claim Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Tensions’ likely under President-elect Trump, Obama says Reuters Video: Trump says ‘you will hear some things tomorrow’ MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Related Articles Emerging markets extend losses as US rate hike seen imminent China’s Sinochem boss dismisses ‘crazy’ Trump polices Pacific leaders urged to defend free trade after Trump win Bursa Malaysia to trade lower next week Dollar strongest in 13 years; bond yields rise Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    U.S. stocks came back from an early loss and finished almost unchanged Monday. Technology companies like Apple and Microsoft took big losses on fears about their overseas revenue, but bank stocks continued to surge along with bond yields. Technology stocks have been weak since last week's election, and they fell further Monday as investors wonder if Donald Trump's policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas. Bank stocks built on their post-election gains as bond yields continued to rise. That paves the way for banks to make more money from lending. Government bond yields are now at their highest levels since January. "The market is sniffing out the belief that some of these Trump policies may drive some better economic growth but also may in fact be somewhat inflationary," said PNC Chief Investment Strategist Bill Stone. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,868.69, another all-time high. The Standard & Poor's 500 index dipped 0.25 points to 2,164.20 after it fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Nasdaq composite sank 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. Technology companies fell sharply, with familiar names taking some of the largest losses. Apple gave up $2.72, or 2.5 percent, to $105.71 while Facebook declined $3.94, or 3.3 percent, to $115.08 and Microsoft slid 90 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $58.12. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slipped $18.53, or 2.4 percent, to $753.22. Bond prices fell and yields jumped as investors anticipated that Trump's spending plans would lead to higher inflation and more government borrowing. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note climbed to 2.25 percent from 2.14 percent late Thursday. Bond trading was closed Friday for the Veterans' Day holiday. The day before the Nov. 8 election, the yield was 1.83 percent. That's a huge move for that benchmark rate. Goldman Sachs rose $5.24 percent, to 2.6 percent, to $209.18 and Bank of America rose $1.06, or 5.6 percent, to $20.08. JPMorgan Chase picked up $2.82, or 3.7 percent, to $79.51. Stone said investors are focused on potential corporate and individual tax cuts, a "wave of deregulation" that eliminates some of the rules governing businesses like energy companies and banks, and more protectionism on trade, which could hurt sales for companies that do a lot of business overseas. Investors are also pleased at the prospect of looser regulation and bigger profits. For example, Trump's election could result in big changes to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill or to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Stone added that corporate dealmaking could increase if Trump's administration takes a looser approach to antitrust regulation. Several companies announced deals or deal offers Monday. South Korean conglomerate Samsung said it will buy Harman International for $8 billion, or $112 a share. Harman makes electronics for cars including audio systems and safety and entertainment features. Its stock jumped $22.07, or 25.2 percent, to $109.72. German industrial equipment company Siemens agreed to buy software maker Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion, or $37.25 a share. Mentor's stock rose $5.61, or 18.3 percent, to $36.29. Shares of communication adapter maker Digi International rose $1.75, or 15 percent, to $13.40 after the company said it received an offer from Belden, a communications equipment company. Digi said it rejected the bid of $13.82 a share, or about $359 million, because it's too low. Belden stock added $1.52, or 2.2 percent, to $71.22. The dollar rose against other currencies as U.S. interest rates rose. It jumped to 108.51 Japanese yen from 106.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0726 from $1.0845. Investors are also selling companies that pay big dividends like utilities and phone companies as bonds become more appealing to investors seeking income. Verizon fell 51 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $46.18 and American Electric Power lost $1.27, or 2.1 percent, to $58.72. Oil prices bounced back from a big loss early on. Benchmark U.S. crude slipped just 9 cents to $43.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 32 cents to $44.43 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.28 a gallon. Heating oil fell 2 cents to $1.39 a gallon. Natural gas jumped 13 cents, or 5 percent, to $2.75 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $2.60 to $1,221.70 an ounce. Silver lost 49 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $16.89 an ounce. Copper picked up 1 cent to $2.52 a pound. France's CAC 40 rose 0.4 percent and Germany's DAX added 0.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed 0.3 percent higher. In Japan the Nikkei 225 jumped 1.7 percent after a strong reading on Japan's economic growth. The Kospi in South Korea lost 0.5 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 1.4 percent. © Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

US stocks finish level as tech losses cancel out bank gains Associated Press | 0 comments NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks came back from an early loss and finished almost unchanged Monday. Technology companies like Apple and Microsoft took big losses on fears about their overseas revenue, but bank stocks continued to surge along with bond yields. Technology stocks have been weak since last week's election, and they fell further Monday as investors wonder if Donald Trump's policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas. Bank stocks built on their post-election gains as bond yields continued to rise. That paves the way for banks to make more money from lending. Government bond yields are now at their highest levels since January. "The market is sniffing out the belief that some of these Trump policies may drive some better economic growth but also may in fact be somewhat inflationary," said PNC Chief Investment Strategist Bill Stone. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,868.69, another all-time high. The Standard & Poor's 500 index dipped 0.25 points to 2,164.20 after it fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Nasdaq composite sank 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. Technology companies fell sharply, with familiar names taking some of the largest losses. Apple gave up $2.72, or 2.5 percent, to $105.71 while Facebook declined $3.94, or 3.3 percent, to $115.08 and Microsoft slid 90 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $58.12. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slipped $18.53, or 2.4 percent, to $753.22. Bond prices fell and yields jumped as investors anticipated that Trump's spending plans would lead to higher inflation and more government borrowing. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note climbed to 2.25 percent from 2.14 percent late Thursday. Bond trading was closed Friday for the Veterans' Day holiday. The day before the Nov. 8 election, the yield was 1.83 percent. That's a huge move for that benchmark rate. Goldman Sachs rose $5.24 percent, to 2.6 percent, to $209.18 and Bank of America rose $1.06, or 5.6 percent, to $20.08. JPMorgan Chase picked up $2.82, or 3.7 percent, to $79.51. Stone said investors are focused on potential corporate and individual tax cuts, a "wave of deregulation" that eliminates some of the rules governing businesses like energy companies and banks, and more protectionism on trade, which could hurt sales for companies that do a lot of business overseas. Investors are also pleased at the prospect of looser regulation and bigger profits. For example, Trump's election could result in big changes to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill or to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Stone added that corporate dealmaking could increase if Trump's administration takes a looser approach to antitrust regulation. Several companies announced deals or deal offers Monday. South Korean conglomerate Samsung said it will buy Harman International for $8 billion, or $112 a share. Harman makes electronics for cars including audio systems and safety and entertainment features. Its stock jumped $22.07, or 25.2 percent, to $109.72. German industrial equipment company Siemens agreed to buy software maker Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion, or $37.25 a share. Mentor's stock rose $5.61, or 18.3 percent, to $36.29. Shares of communication adapter maker Digi International rose $1.75, or 15 percent, to $13.40 after the company said it received an offer from Belden, a communications equipment company. Digi said it rejected the bid of $13.82 a share, or about $359 million, because it's too low. Belden stock added $1.52, or 2.2 percent, to $71.22. The dollar rose against other currencies as U.S. interest rates rose. It jumped to 108.51 Japanese yen from 106.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0726 from $1.0845. Investors are also selling companies that pay big dividends like utilities and phone companies as bonds become more appealing to investors seeking income. Verizon fell 51 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $46.18 and American Electric Power lost $1.27, or 2.1 percent, to $58.72. Oil prices bounced back from a big loss early on. Benchmark U.S. crude slipped just 9 cents to $43.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 32 cents to $44.43 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.28 a gallon. Heating oil fell 2 cents to $1.39 a gallon. Natural gas jumped 13 cents, or 5 percent, to $2.75 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $2.60 to $1,221.70 an ounce. Silver lost 49 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $16.89 an ounce. Copper picked up 1 cent to $2.52 a pound. France's CAC 40 rose 0.4 percent and Germany's DAX added 0.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed 0.3 percent higher. In Japan the Nikkei 225 jumped 1.7 percent after a strong reading on Japan's economic growth. The Kospi in South Korea lost 0.5 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 1.4 percent. ____ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay © 2016 The Associated Press.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has been under pressure since the Nov. 8 election as investors poured money into sectors such as financials, industrials and energy, which are seen benefiting from President-elect Donald Trump's policies.The financial index rose 2.3 percent, with banks including Bank of America JPMorgan providing the biggest boost. The index has risen 10.8 percent since the election on hopes of deregulation and higher interest rates. While the financial rally gained steam, the S&P technology index closed down 1.7 percent, leading the decliners. The index has fallen 3 percent since the election. Apple fell 2.5 percent and weighed the most on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, followed by Facebook and Microsoft. Since technology valuations have soared in recent years, investors are switching money to sectors such as banks, which has been relatively cheaper but should now benefit from rising interest rates, said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.Investors have been betting technology will look relatively less attractive if Trump lives up to his promise to review regulation in healthcare and financial sectors and to increase government spending on infrastructure to boost economic growth. "If growth becomes more even and available, we may see a continuation of rotation into lower-valuation, more cyclical businesses and out of high-valuation growth stocks like technology," said James Abate, chief investment officer at Centre Asset Management in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 21.03 points, or 0.11 percent, to 18,868.69, the S&P 500 lost 0.25 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,164.2 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 18.72 points, or 0.36 percent, to 5,218.40.The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates at its December meeting, with traders pricing in a 91-percent chance, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.The industrial index finished up 0.4 percent, buoyed by prospects for increased infrastructure outlays. Harman International rose 25.2 percent to $109.72 after Samsung Electronics announced an $8 billion deal to buy the company.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.44-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&P 500 posted 82 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 423 new highs and 31 new lows.About 10 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Monday, far above the 7.7 billion average for the previous 20 sessions.

Allen & Company, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Cowen and Company, and Guggenheim Securities are also on the deal. Analysts have previously valued Trivago at $5 billion . Business Insider previously reported that Trivago was looking to list its shares by the end of November. A filing at this point in the month makes that impossible, but Trivago could still debut before the end of the year.  Expedia said in July that Trivago had generated $200 million in revenue in the second quarter, and more than $660 million on a trailing 12-month basis. The listing would mark another step toward the tech IPO market's comeback. Deal activity all but stopped last year as investor sentiment soured, and has been slow to pick up in 2016.  The largest tech IPO to date was by Japanese messaging app Line, which listed in Tokyo and New York in July and raised $1.24 billion, about two-thirds of which was in the US. Nasdaq vice chairman Bruce Aust told Business Insider earlier this month that he expects four or five technology IPOs before the end of the year.  SEE ALSO: Reynolds American has reportedly rejected British American Tobacco's $47 billion takeover offer NOW WATCH: Richard Branson: Entrepreneurs need to fill the gap where government is lacking Loading video...

Stocks are opening modestly higher on Wall Street, led by gains in banks as interest rates continue to rise. (Richard Drew/Associated Press) By Marley Jay | AP November 14 NEW YORK — U.S. stocks came back from an early loss and finished almost unchanged Monday. Technology companies like Apple and Microsoft took big losses on fears about their overseas revenue, but bank stocks continued to surge along with bond yields. Technology stocks have been weak since last week’s election, and they fell further Monday as investors wonder if Donald Trump’s policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas. Bank stocks built on their post-election gains as bond yields continued to rise. That paves the way for banks to make more money from lending. Government bond yields are now at their highest levels since January. “The market is sniffing out the belief that some of these Trump policies may drive some better economic growth but also may in fact be somewhat inflationary,” said PNC Chief Investment Strategist Bill Stone. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,868.69, another all-time high. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index dipped 0.25 points to 2,164.20 after it fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Nasdaq composite sank 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. Technology companies fell sharply, with familiar names taking some of the largest losses. Apple gave up $2.72, or 2.5 percent, to $105.71 while Facebook declined $3.94, or 3.3 percent, to $115.08 and Microsoft slid 90 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $58.12. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slipped $18.53, or 2.4 percent, to $753.22. Bond prices fell and yields jumped as investors anticipated that Trump’s spending plans would lead to higher inflation and more government borrowing. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note climbed to 2.25 percent from 2.14 percent late Thursday. Bond trading was closed Friday for the Veterans’ Day holiday. The day before the Nov. 8 election, the yield was 1.83 percent. That’s a huge move for that benchmark rate. Goldman Sachs rose $5.24 percent, to 2.6 percent, to $209.18 and Bank of America rose $1.06, or 5.6 percent, to $20.08. JPMorgan Chase picked up $2.82, or 3.7 percent, to $79.51. Stone said investors are focused on potential corporate and individual tax cuts, a “wave of deregulation” that eliminates some of the rules governing businesses like energy companies and banks, and more protectionism on trade, which could hurt sales for companies that do a lot of business overseas. Investors are also pleased at the prospect of looser regulation and bigger profits. For example, Trump’s election could result in big changes to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill or to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Stone added that corporate dealmaking could increase if Trump’s administration takes a looser approach to antitrust regulation. Several companies announced deals or deal offers Monday. South Korean conglomerate Samsung said it will buy Harman International for $8 billion, or $112 a share. Harman makes electronics for cars including audio systems and safety and entertainment features. Its stock jumped $22.07, or 25.2 percent, to $109.72. German industrial equipment company Siemens agreed to buy software maker Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion, or $37.25 a share. Mentor’s stock rose $5.61, or 18.3 percent, to $36.29. Shares of communication adapter maker Digi International rose $1.75, or 15 percent, to $13.40 after the company said it received an offer from Belden, a communications equipment company. Digi said it rejected the bid of $13.82 a share, or about $359 million, because it’s too low. Belden stock added $1.52, or 2.2 percent, to $71.22. The dollar rose against other currencies as U.S. interest rates rose. It jumped to 108.51 Japanese yen from 106.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0726 from $1.0845. Investors are also selling companies that pay big dividends like utilities and phone companies as bonds become more appealing to investors seeking income. Verizon fell 51 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $46.18 and American Electric Power lost $1.27, or 2.1 percent, to $58.72. Oil prices bounced back from a big loss early on. Benchmark U.S. crude slipped just 9 cents to $43.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 32 cents to $44.43 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.28 a gallon. Heating oil fell 2 cents to $1.39 a gallon. Natural gas jumped 13 cents, or 5 percent, to $2.75 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $2.60 to $1,221.70 an ounce. Silver lost 49 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $16.89 an ounce. Copper picked up 1 cent to $2.52 a pound. France’s CAC 40 rose 0.4 percent and Germany’s DAX added 0.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed 0.3 percent higher. In Japan the Nikkei 225 jumped 1.7 percent after a strong reading on Japan’s economic growth. The Kospi in South Korea lost 0.5 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped 1.4 percent. ____ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

By: Reuters | Published:November 15, 2016 2:09 am President-elect Donald Trump. (AP Photo) US stocks were lower in early afternoon trading on Monday as tech stocks weighed and investors looked for more clarity on President-elect Donald Trump’s policies. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has remained under pressure as investors pour more money in other sectors that are seen benefiting from Trump’s policies. The S&P technology index’s 2.08 percent fall led the decliners, with the index having lost more than 3 percent since the election last week. Apple was down 3.4 percent and weighed the most on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, followed by Facebook and Microsoft. Visa’s 5.5 percent fall dragged the Dow. The Dow, which capped off its best week in five years on Friday, hit a another record-high just after the start of trading but soon lost those gains. Since Trump’s triumph last Tuesday, investors have been betting on his campaign promises to simplify regulation in the health and financial sectors and boost spending on infrastructure. Watch What Else Is Making News  However, analysts said investors want specific details regarding Trump’s policies and are also awaiting key appointments in his administration. “In any election cycle, many candidates make a lot of election promises and obviously they can’t deliver for a variety of reasons on all these promises,” said Mohannad Aama, managing director at Beam Capital Management in New York. “Right now during this transition period, there is a lot of pricing in the unknown.” The financial index rose 1.77 percent, with Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan providing the biggest boost. The index has risen over 8 percent in the last three sessions on hopes of deregulation and higher interest rates. The industrial index was also up 0.36 percent, buoyed by prospects for increased infrastructure outlays. At 12:40 p.m. ET (1740 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 9.28 points, or 0.05 percent, at 18,838.38, the S&P 500 was down 5.51 points, or 0.25 percent, at 2,158.94 and the Nasdaq Composite index was down 35.30 points, or 0.67 percent, at 5,201.81. The risk of faster domestic inflation and wider budget deficits if Trump goes on a spending binge sent yields on U.S. Treasury and other benchmark global bonds higher. The dollar index surged to an 11-month high. Yields on the U.S. 10-year Treasury notes climbed to their highest since January on Monday at 2.30 percent, while 30-year paper shot above 3 percent. Rising inflation hurts bond prices because it makes their future interest payments worth less. A host of U.S. Federal Reserve officials are scheduled to make appearances on Monday, including Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan, Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker and San Francisco Fed President John Williams. The central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates at its December meeting, with traders pricing in an 91 percent chance, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. Oil fell more than 2 percent to its lowest in three months, as the prospect of another year of oversupply and weak prices overshadowed chances OPEC will reach a deal to cut output. Harman International rose 25.1 percent to $109.66 after Samsung Electronics announced an $8 billion deal to buy the company. Mentor Graphics surged more than 19 percent to a record high of $36.55 after Siemens agreed to buy the company in a $4.5 billion deal. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,604 to 1,388. On the Nasdaq, 1,532 issues rose and 1,247 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 79 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 394 new highs and 24 new lows.

Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images Monday 14 November 2016 15.06 EST Last modified on Monday 14 November 2016 17.59 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close It remains early days for assessing Donald Trump’s economic plans, not least because of the difficulty in separating the serious policies from the wilder campaigning rhetoric, but the bond market seems clear on the central point: the president-elect intends to cut tax taxes, increase spending and deregulate. Investors know what that cocktail produces. It boosts growth, at least for a while, and it generates inflation. Even famed liberal economist Paul Krugman has switched from predicting an imminent global recession. “Don’t be surprised if economic growth actually accelerates for a couple of years,” he says, because the “dire effects of Trumpism” will take time to become manifest. In the bond market, a mini-rout is under way as yields on government debt climb across the board. US 1o-year Treasuries were yielding 1.35% in the summer and 1.85% on the eve of Trump’s victory; now they are 2.19%, a huge move in such a short space of time. In the UK, the 10-year gilt yield, which fell as low as 0.5% in the same summer lull, is now 1.4%. Global bonds slump as Trump prompts inflation fears Read more A return of more normal yields, encouraged by the prospect of fiscal stimulus and higher rates of growth, is just what the world has been crying out for, many at both ends of the political spectrum would agree. Years of near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing haven’t rebooted the global economy, so try something different. Well, yes, but let’s not pretend that such fiscal medicine is risk-free, especially when taken in the dosage Trump intends. A cut in the business tax rate from 35% to 15%, and $550bn to be spent on new infrastructure, represent crisis-style responses. But, as JP Morgan’s chief global strategist David Kelly argues, the idea that the US is massively underperforming its potential for growth and requires a big fiscal stimulus is wrong. The US economy is at virtual full employment and the federal budget deficit is already rising. Indeed, the US Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated in September that Trump’s plans for massive personal and corporate tax cuts plus more defence spending would push the US national debt to 105% of GDP by 2026, against 77% currently and 86% assumed for 2026 under current laws. “The truth is, boosting the federal debt to these levels is fiscally reckless,” argues Kelly. The inflationary impact of a spending spree looks likely to be even more severe if the US is simultaneously blocking skilled immigration and imposing 1930s-style trade tariffs around the world. A big boom followed by an almighty bust? That script seems very plausible. Nor should we surprised if there are accidents on the way. In the early days of quantitative easing, central banks used to warn us that the exit from the bond bubble they created would have to be managed carefully because of its capacity to destabilise the financial system. You can understand why they worried: if government debt, supposedly the safest form of asset, is suddenly imposing double-digit losses on holders, there will be consequences. Prepare to see them soon: the bond bubble has been 30 years in the making and it won’t deflate painlessly. William Hill back in the race after failed merger It should not be news that a gambling company is appointing to its board some non-executives with experience of the gambling industry. It is at William Hill, where the boardroom is currently populated by non-specialists, a shortcoming that was cruelly exposed when shareholders shot down the board’s half-baked idea of exploring a £4.6bn merger with Amaya, a Canadian online poker company. John O’Reilly, formerly of Ladbrokes and Coral, and Mark Brooker, former chief operating officer at Betfair, will improve the board’s gambling quota from zero to two. Robin Terrell, a former digital wizard for Tesco, also looks a sensible hire. Gareth Davis, chairman for the past six years, did not explain why the obvious gap in expertise had not been filled previously but he has heard the criticisms and responded, which may quell the calls for his own departure. Full rehabilitation will depend on the two other factors. First, the company needs to avoid further trading upsets while Davis completes his search for a chief executive to relieve Philip Bowman, whose own lack of a gambling background makes him an imperfect candidate. On that front, news that full-year operating profits are still expected to arrive towards the top of a £260m to £280m range gets a tick. The other factor will be evidence that William Hill won’t have its head turned by the next flashy Amaya-style proposal. The new boardroom appointments suggest self-help is indeed the priority again. Good, but the path to this point should not have been so roundabout.

Sydney’s S&P-ASX 200 tumbled 0.5 percent to 5,320.60 and Seoul’s Kospi was almost unchanged at 1,974.27. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 0.4 percent to 22,314.62. Benchmarks in Southeast Asia and New Zealand were mixed. WALL STREET: Tech companies including Apple and Microsoft took big losses on concern Trump’s policies might hurt their sales in China and other global markets. Bank stocks surged as bond yields rose, which allows them to make more money from lending. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,868.69, another all-time high. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index dipped 0.25 points to 2,164.20 after it fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Nasdaq composite sank 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. RISING DOLLAR: The dollar climbed as high as 108.30 yen from Monday’s 107.87 yen as expectations of a U.S. rate hike rose. Trump’s surprise election initially raised expectations the Federal Reserve might put off a rate hike until his plans were clear. But analysts say the latest comments from Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan indicate the Fed is sticking to plans to act in December. “There appears no stopping the U.S. dollar’s recent ascent based on the current interest rate trajectory,” Stephen Innes of OANDA said in a report. TRUMP WATCH: Investors were watching for signs of what Trump, who gave few details of his plans on the campaign trail, might do in office. Analysts say his promises of tax cuts and higher infrastructure spending could boost economic growth but also spur inflation. His threats of sanctions against China and other trading partners that he accuses of acting unfairly have rattled trade-dependent Asian economies. ANALYST’S TAKE: “Moving forward, the spotlight could shine on the contentious trade policy proposals that the president-elect had raised during his campaign,” said Jingyi Pan of IG in a report. “The latest soundbite from outgoing President Barack Obama seems to suggest that the incoming president is ‘ultimately pragmatic’,” said Pan. “It is without a doubt that emerging Asian markets would be negatively impacted should a trade war break out between US and China, although the delayed address could mean that the President-elect may indeed be more pragmatic than we have known.” CURRENCY: The euro was little-changed at $1.0752. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude gained 89 cents to $44.21 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract shed 9 cents on Monday to close at $43.32. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 75 cents to $45.19 in London. It lost 32 cents on Monday to $44.43.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermidMore By Sinead Carew (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed little changed on Monday after rising dramatically the week before and a decline in the technology sector offset a steep rise in financial stocks as investors bet on higher interest rates. After choppy trading late in the session, the Dow ended at a record high while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite dipped. "I think all we're doing is trimming our sails a little from the violently positive rally we had post-election results last week," said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has been under pressure since the Nov. 8 election as investors poured money into sectors such as financials, industrials and energy, which are seen benefiting from President-elect Donald Trump's policies. The financial index <.SPSY> rose 2.3 percent, with banks including Bank of America JPMorgan providing the biggest boost. The index has risen 10.8 percent since the election on hopes of deregulation and higher interest rates. While the financial rally gained steam, the S&P technology index <.SPLRCT> closed down 1.7 percent, leading the decliners. The index has fallen 3 percent since the election. Apple fell 2.5 percent and weighed the most on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, followed by Facebook and Microsoft . Since technology valuations have soared in recent years, investors are switching money to sectors such as banks, which has been relatively cheaper but should now benefit from rising interest rates, said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Investors have been betting technology will look relatively less attractive if Trump lives up to his promise to review regulation in healthcare and financial sectors and to increase government spending on infrastructure to boost economic growth. "If growth becomes more even and available, we may see a continuation of rotation into lower-valuation, more cyclical businesses and out of high-valuation growth stocks like technology," said James Abate, chief investment officer at Centre Asset Management in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed up 21.03 points, or 0.11 percent, to 18,868.69, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 0.25 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,164.2 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 18.72 points, or 0.36 percent, to 5,218.40. The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates at its December meeting, with traders pricing in a 91-percent chance, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. The industrial index <.SPLRCI> finished up 0.4 percent, buoyed by prospects for increased infrastructure outlays. Harman International rose 25.2 percent to $109.72 after Samsung Electronics <005930.KS> announced an $8 billion deal to buy the company. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.44-to-1 ratio favoured advancers. The S&P 500 posted 82 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 423 new highs and 31 new lows. About 10 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Monday, far above the 7.7 billion average for the previous 20 sessions.

Treasury Pick Mnuchin Drew Praise, Scorn After IndyMac Deal By Kristin Broughton November 14, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Risk taker: "He took a company that was a very visibly failed institution of the mortgage crisis and rehabilitated it," an analyst said about Steven Mnuchin's career in banking. Related CIT Hires Consultant to Help Speed Up Turnaround CIT Chief Resists Calls to Shed SIFI Status CIT Appoints HSBC Exec as General Counsel What Bankers Want (and Don't Want) from President Trump 'That's Just Really, Really Bad': Bank CEOs React to Wells Scandal Why Media Representation Matters for Women in Banking Note: This story was originally published Nov. 11, but has been updated following developments Monday. Before Steven Mnuchin became President-elect Donald Trump's likely nominee to lead the Treasury Department, he was a driving force behind one of the most controversial banking turnarounds during the financial crisis. Mnuchin was the top fundraiser for Trump's victorious presidential campaign. That experience has paid off in a big way for the former Wall Street banker, whom Trump's transition team has recommended that he nominate for Treasury secretary, according to a Bloomberg News report citing sources familiar with the process. Other candidates floated in connection with the job included House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling and even JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon. Mnuchin, who spent nearly two decades at Goldman Sachs, had drawn attention in recent years for a big gamble he and fellow investors took in commercial banking. He was instrumental in the recapitalization of the failed mortgage lender IndyMac, its return to financial health as OneWest Bank and its ultimate sale to CIT Group in a lucrative deal. He joined the CIT board after the 2015 sale and has since pushed the $66 billion-asset company to slim down and boost returns. How that experience will translate into a career in public service is unclear. Though Mnuchin — who has never held public office — has a track record of success in financial services, there have also been hiccups along the way, including criticism from community groups for ignoring the needs of underserved communities. "He took a company that was a very visibly failed institution of the mortgage crisis and rehabilitated it," said Vincent Caintic, an analyst with Stephens. "He made it into a stable and viable company and sold it successfully for double the money." Caintic said that Mnuchin's experience rehabilitating companies could bode well for a career in government. Additionally, the fact that he worked closely with regulators, negotiating the terms of a failed-bank acquisition, could work in his favor. But memories of Mnuchin's crisis-era move into banking still gnaw at some community activists. Mnuchin in 2009 led a group of Wall Street investors — including George Soros and John Paulson — in rebuilding IndyMac under the OneWest brand. "In some ways, the bank was the poster child for income inequality," said Kevin Stein, deputy director at the California Reinvestment Coalition, noting the disconnect between the high-profile bank investors and borrowers who were struggling during the crisis to pay their mortgages. Stein said that the company generated ill will around its Pasadena, Calif., footprint, in particular, because of foreclosures it made on widows through Financial Freedom, its reverse-mortgage-servicing business. Financial Freedom is currently under investigation by the Department of Housing and Urban Development for issues related to its accounting. CIT has discontinued the business. The deal also was one of those that attracted intense scrutiny because of the windfall it generated for private-equity investors, former Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chair Sheila Bair has said. Though a nomination is uncertain, especially in as fluid a situation as the days following Trump's stunning win over Hillary Clinton, it would mark a career shift for Mnuchin, a financial executive who has had a somewhat peripatetic career. Mnuchin began his financial services career in 1985 at Goldman, where he ultimately rose to partner and chief information officer. He left the investment banking giant in 2002 and, two years later, established the investment firm Dune Capital Management. Outside of his career in banking, he has also earned a reputation in film. He has helped finance hit movies such as "Avatar." He also briefly served as co-chairman of Relativity Media but resigned last year before the Beverly Hills, Calif., studio filed for bankruptcy. Within the world of bread-and-butter banking, though, Mnuchin has earned a reputation for getting results. Mnuchin decided to enter the business back in 2008, when he saw a TV news shot of customers lined up outside of the $32 billion-asset IndyMac, hoping to withdraw their money. He decided that the time was right to buy a bank, according to a Bloomberg Businessweek story on him. He led a group of investors who bought the assets of IndyMac in 2009, nine months after its blockbuster failure. The group negotiated lucrative terms to a loss-share agreement with the FDIC and within less than a year turned a $1.6 billion profit. As chairman of the newly formed OneWest, Mnuchin helped lead a rapid turnaround. The company moved away from risky mortgage loans and sought to become a more of a "full-service" regional bank with additional branches, according to Caintic. In August 2015, OneWest was sold to CIT, which was run at the time by Wall Street icon John Thain. The deal pushed CIT — another crisis-era turnaround story — above the threshold to be considered a systemically important financial institution. A key priority of Thain was asset growth and burnishing CIT's reputation as a major industry player. But Mnuchin has been influential in pushing CIT to focus, instead, on boosting returns and simplifying its business model. « 1  |  2 »     view entire article Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints JOIN THE DISCUSSION Comment SEE MORE IN National/Regional RELATED TAGS Law & Regulation, Dealmaking & Strategy Comments (0) Be the first to comment on this post using the section below.

Lost in the post-election stock market euphoria is the fact that the bond market has suffered a dramatic wave of selling that is rare in recent history. It’s sent interest rates on U.S. bonds spiking, making it more expensive for the federal government to borrow money. The rate on 10-year Treasury notes has surged to 2.3%, from 1.77% before the election. Last week’s spike in Treasury rates was so big, that it had only happened three times before in the last decade. BlackRock’s Russ Koesterich called it a “violent reaction.” The move stands to have broad repercussions for all Americans. Not only will the U.S. government have to pay more to borrow money, but mortgage rates and car loan costs should also rise. That’s because Treasuries are used as the benchmark for many other forms of credit. The bond market’s reaction shows investors believe Trump’s plans will add to America’s already-massive debt load and cause inflation to rise. Here’s a rundown on the major forces causing the bond market to tank: Spending concerns: Trump has pledged to give the American economy a shot in the arm by spending heavily on infrastructure. “We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals,” Trump declared in his victory speech. That pledge has been great news for infrastructure stocks like Caterpillar and U.S. Steel. Trump’s win has also sent defense stocks like Lockheed Martin flying higher because he wants to ramp up military spending. But the bond market is concerned about whether America can afford all of that spending. “The federal budget is already dangerously out of balance,” David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds, wrote in a note on Monday. Debt worries: On top of heavy spending, Trump has promised massive tax cuts that would reduce revenue by $7 trillion in the first decade alone, according to the Tax Policy Center. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates Trump’s fiscal plans, especially the tax cuts, would cause the U.S. debt to soar to 143% of GDP by 2026, compared with 104% today. “The truth is boosting the federal debt to these levels is fiscally reckless,” Kelly wrote. That partly explains why the 30-year Treasury rate topped 3% on Monday for the first time since January. Inflation back from the dead? Investors are also bracing for Trump stimulus to carry inflation out of the post-crisis doldrums. Prices could also rise if Trump’s anti-trade stance means more goods are made in America, according to Ed Yardeni, president of investment advisory Yardeni Research, wrote in a note. “The bond market seems to be raising the odds of Trumponomics’ inflationary consequences,” Yardeni wrote in a note. Fed rate hikes: Rates are rising because many anticipate the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates next month for the first time in a year. If Trump’s policies end up causing growth and inflation to tick up, it could cause the Fed to raise rates faster than previously planned. Fallout: It’s possible the bond market reaction is overdone. Much will depend on what policies Trump actually pursues — and how much support he gets from the Republican-led Congress. However, if bonds continue to sell off, the consequences could be profound. Higher rates will make it more expensive for the U.S. government to finance its increasingly-large debt load. Bespoke Investment Group warns “soaring” Treasury rates signal a significant jump in mortgage rates that on top of rising home prices could hurt the housing market. So far, the stock market hasn’t seemed too concerned by the rip higher in bond rates. But that may change. After all, extremely low interest rates helped fuel the stock market’s rise over the past seven years. By contrast, higher returns for risk-free Treasuries may make investors think twice before betting on risky stocks. Continued selling in the bond market could also mark the end of the decades-long bull market in bonds. BlackRock’s Koesterich said absent a “pretty catastrophic shock” to the global economy, bond rates likely bottomed earlier this year.

Posted 14 Nov 2016 22:10 Updated 15 Nov 2016 06:00 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., November 10, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: U.S. stocks closed little changed on Monday after rising dramatically the week before and a decline in the technology sector offset a steep rise in financial stocks as investors bet on higher interest rates. After choppy trading late in the session, the Dow ended at a record high while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite dipped. "I think all we're doing is trimming our sails a little from the violently positive rally we had post-election results last week," said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has been under pressure since the Nov. 8 election as investors poured money into sectors such as financials, industrials and energy, which are seen benefiting from President-elect Donald Trump's policies. The financial index rose 2.3 percent, with banks including Bank of America JPMorgan providing the biggest boost. The index has risen 10.8 percent since the election on hopes of deregulation and higher interest rates. While the financial rally gained steam, the S&P technology index closed down 1.7 percent, leading the decliners. The index has fallen 3 percent since the election. Apple fell 2.5 percent and weighed the most on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, followed by Facebook and Microsoft. Since technology valuations have soared in recent years, investors are switching money to sectors such as banks, which has been relatively cheaper but should now benefit from rising interest rates, said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Investors have been betting technology will look relatively less attractive if Trump lives up to his promise to review regulation in healthcare and financial sectors and to increase government spending on infrastructure to boost economic growth. "If growth becomes more even and available, we may see a continuation of rotation into lower-valuation, more cyclical businesses and out of high-valuation growth stocks like technology," said James Abate, chief investment officer at Centre Asset Management in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 21.03 points, or 0.11 percent, to 18,868.69, the S&P 500 lost 0.25 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,164.2 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 18.72 points, or 0.36 percent, to 5,218.40. The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates at its December meeting, with traders pricing in a 91-percent chance, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. The industrial index finished up 0.4 percent, buoyed by prospects for increased infrastructure outlays. Harman International rose 25.2 percent to US$109.72 after Samsung Electronics announced an US$8 billion deal to buy the company. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.44-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 82 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 423 new highs and 31 new lows. About 10 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Monday, far above the 7.7 billion average for the previous 20 sessions.

Photo: AP SEE ALSO Why the markets decided to love Trump after all :0 When the unexpected happens, like Britain exiting the European Union... Why the markets decided to love Trump after all The Donald Trump rally spread to a fourth day on Monday morning. The Dow Jones industrial average opened at a record high, driven by financial stocks, after the index capped off its best week since 2011 following Trump’s unexpected victory in the presidential election on Nov. 8. The Dow was up in each of the three days since the Trump victory. Since Trump’s triumph last Tuesday, investors have been betting on his campaign promises to simplify regulation in the health and financial sectors and boost spending on infrastructure. The Dow rose 2.2 percent to its highest level since 2008. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan provided the biggest boost to both the S&P 500 and the Dow. The Nasdaq Composite was little changed, weighed down by tech giants Apple, Facebook and Microsoft. Stock markets around the world were affected by a continued selloff in the global bond market as investors looked for more clarity regarding Trump’s policies. The risk of faster domestic inflation and wider budget deficits if Trump goes on a spending binge sent yields on Treasury and other benchmark global bonds higher. The dollar index surged to an 11-month high. Yields on 10-year Treasury notes climbed to their highest since January on Monday at 2.30 percent, while 30-year paper shot above 3 percent. “The bond market could subject the Trump rally to a halt,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York. “The prospect of higher inflation due to higher fiscal spending under the Trump administration has caused bonds to sell off and while higher inflation is good for the US economy in the long run, it is seen as a negative factor in the short term because this market is used to near zero interest rates.” At 10:55 a.m. , the Dow was up 10 points, to 18,857.18. The S&P 500 was down 3 points , at 2,161.72. The Nasdaq Composite was down 26 points, 5,210.77. A host of Federal Reserve officials are scheduled to make appearances on Monday, including Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan, Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker and San Francisco Fed President John Williams. The central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates at its December meeting, with traders pricing in an 81 percent chance, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool.

According to a research report published today, Blacks and Latinos are “severely underrepresented” among borrowers who obtained a loan from a major bank to purchase a home in the city of Oakland. The report, by the Greenlining Institute and Urban Strategies Council, also found that banks issued a much smaller total number of home mortgage loans in Oakland compared to Fresno and Long Beach, two other cities analyzed in the study. And Black and Latino borrowers in Oakland applied for home loans at very low rates, and were approved at lower rates than whites. This dearth in mortgage lending by major banks in Oakland, compounded by low numbers of mortgage loan applications from Black and Latino customers, and lower loan approval rates, is perpetuating and exacerbating wealth disparities, the authors of the study concluded. See also: JP Morgan Chase's Home Loans in Oakland Mostly Went to White and Wealthy Residents The study analyzed bank lending data for the year 2013 that was obtained from the federal government. The twelve largest banks, measured by the total dollar amount of loans originated in California, were included in the study. The authors compared Oakland, Fresno, and Long Beach because these cities are of similar size and have racially diverse populations, and they represent different geographic areas of the state with different economies. The data analyzed by the Greenlining Institute and Urban Strategies Council showed that major banks are making far fewer total mortgage loans in Oakland compared to Fresno and Long Beach. “Despite comparable populations, Oakland had less than one quarter as many loan applications and originations as Long Beach and Fresno,” the report states. It’s unclear why major banks are approving fewer home loans in Oakland, but it may be due to Oakland’s increasingly unaffordable prices, and the presence of cash investors who crowd out buyers who need bank loans to close a deal. Whatever the cause, this lower level of bank lending in Oakland is compounded by racial disparities. According to the report, Black and Latino residents make up 56 percent of Oakland’s total population, but they received just 10 percent of the total dollars lent by major banks for home purchases. “Across the board, what the report shows is that Black and Latino communities were way under-represented when it comes to obtaining mortgage loans,” said Zachary Murray of the Greenlining Institute, one of the authors of the report. Greenlining Institute and Urban Strategies Council found that in 2013 the top twelve banks only approved a total of four loans for Black borrowers to purchase homes in the city of Oakland. The other 44 home mortgage loans made to Black borrowers in Oakland were refinance loans. In the same year, Latinos only obtained sixty mortgage loans in Oakland, and just seven of these were to purchase a home. By contrast, white borrowers obtained 358 mortgage loans in 2013 and 40 of these were to purchase homes. Asians obtained 186 mortgage loans, and 37 of these were to buy a home. Particular banks exhibited wide racial disparities in their mortgage lending activities. According to the report, Wells Fargo Bank, US Bank, and CashCall all exhibited much lower loan origination rates for Blacks and Latinos than for Asians and whites. A loan origination rate measures what percent of applicants for a loan are approved and receive the loan. Some banks, including Chase and Bank of America did better, originating loans at almost equal rates for Black and Latino customers as they did for white and Asian customers. But for all of the twelve banks analyzed in the report, white and Asian customers were more likely to have their loans approved than Black and Latino customers. Sasha Werblin of Greenlining, one of the authors of the study, said that lower average household wealth and income could be one reason that Blacks and Latinos are less able to obtain home loans. The economic crisis and recession of 2007-2010, and the foreclosure crisis that peaked in 2011-2012 reduced the savings of many families, and had a disproportionately harmful impact on Black and Latino households in California. But Werblin said that it is also incumbent on banks to offer sustainable and quality financial products that help them build wealth and secure housing. “What are banks doing to market to these individuals? Do they have products that would fit the needs of these individuals?” said Weblin in a previous interview.

Back to site Activism Banking Spain These Spanish Activists Have Taken Punishing Bankers Into Their Own Hands Their work is a model for citizen action against the architects of financial collapse. By Anne Koch November 14, 2016 Facebook Twitter Email Print Protestors wear masks of Rodrigo Rato, the former director of the International Monetary Fund, as they march outside the National Court, Madrid, Spain, December 20, 2012. (AP Photo / Andres Kudacki) It is often said that no one responsible for the financial crash of 2008 ever went to prison. In Spain, however, a group of ordinary citizens are in the process of dragging one of Spain’s most eminent bankers through the criminal courts for fraud, money laundering, and embezzlement. Ad Policy At the heart of this campaign is Simona Levi, a slight, dark-haired, softly spoken woman, born in Turin to left-wing intellectuals, and related to Primo Levi. She is a dancer and actress by training, a student of Turin’s School of Dance and of Jacques Lecoq’s theater school in Paris. She has lived in Barcelona since 1990. A theater director and a performance artist, she is also a prominent activist in a variety of movements for social justice. Levi’s opponent is Rodrigo Rato, a former president of Bankia, one of the biggest banks in Spain, and a banker of global repute, once holding the top job at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington. As respected and powerful in Spain as JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was on Wall Street, Rato presided over a massive fraudulent sale of the bank’s shares. Rodrigo Rato is now facing jail, a success for Simona Levi and an unlikely group of people of which she is leader. It demonstrates that bankers can be brought to justice when ordinary people unite and force prosecutors to do their jobs. The 2008 economic crisis hit Spain hard. The government brought in tough austerity measures, and inequality and unemployment rose sharply—at its peak, more than one-quarter of the working population was out of work. Despair was widespread and people were angry—as in other Southern European countries, conditions triggered popular protest. Simona Levi reacted by setting up an organization with a group of activists. It became known as Xnet, “a peaceful guerrilla movement,” as she puts it. Their manifesto, Democracy, period, calls for greater institutional transparency; “wikilegislation,” giving citizens the right to participate in drawing up laws and proposals; and what Xnet calls a “permanent vote” that would ensure referendums are held regularly on important issues. Xnet and others also created a political party, Partido X or X Party. Like many others they wanted to break the hold of the People’s Party and the Spanish Socialist Workers Party, which had taken turns running the country since the death of the fascist dictator Franco in 1975 and whose misrule had led to the crisis. Austerity in Spain didn’t work. Incomes continued to fall and youth unemployment reached a staggering 46 percent in the autumn of 2011. Popular protest movements grew. On May 15, 2011 the main squares in cities and towns throughout Spain were occupied for weeks; the movement that would later be called the Indignados, also known as 15M for the day it began, demanded radical political change, and out of the mass occupations, collectives of activists and citizens organized themselves into neighborhood and workplace assemblies. Simona Levi and Xnet were part of this movement.

Michael Flynn Then in May 2012, one of the biggest banks in the country, Bankia, went bust and the long-suffering taxpayers, who had endured almost four years of austerity measures by then, had to bail it out. Levi was appalled and couldn’t understand how it had happened. She invited some other Xnet members to an informal meeting in a bar off Las Ramblas to discuss what they could do. Those around the table were activists Levi previously had gone to battle with and trusted, and were, she said, people she valued for their independence of thought. They included a gardener, a chef, and a young female IT expert. Sipping their drinks, they talked about how the government had given billions of euros to the banks, but despite this, the crisis had only worsened; now it was Bankia that had failed. Levi had read two pieces of news that horrified her: Bankia had swallowed up a quarter of all the government financing, received by Spain from the EU, to bail out the banks. According to Levi’s calculations, the failure of this single bank accounted for one-seventh of the whole of Spanish government debt. She told me how shocked she was when she saw the latter figure in particular; it was her light-bulb moment, she said. She’d been reading about the fiasco in Iceland and following the work being done by one of the Indignado groupings, the Citizen Debt Audit Platform, but when she read the Bankia figures, it struck her, as she put it to me, that “you have to do something very wrong to have a debt like that.” No one gathered in the bar with her could explain it, so Levi proposed that Xnet try to investigate by focussing on this one bank, Bankia, and its president, Rodrigo Rato. The consequences of this meeting in a Barcelona bar are still unfolding. Bankia was formed in 2010 through the merger of seven small, highly indebted and vulnerable savings banks or “cajas.” The 300-year old Caja Madrid was by far the largest, and its president, Rodrigo Rato, became president of the entire group. The conglomerate was set up to absorb all the profitable business and surviving loans of these cajas, while their risky assets, a result of hugely speculative property deals, were hived off to another specially created bank. This toxic bank would be owned by the government, while the healthy Bankia, now the fourth-largest bank in Spain, with 4,000 branches and 25,000 employees, could be sold off. Its shares were offered to the public in May 2011. However, investment bankers and other financial institutions showed little interest in the IPO, and so most of the initial 3.1 billion euros was raised by selling the shares to small domestic savers—about 360,000 of them. GET A DIGITAL SUBSCRIPTION FOR JUST $9.50! Subscribe Rato, when he took over the banking conglomerate, stood at the pinnacle of Spain’s establishment: He was a former minister of finance and economics, vice president of the center-right People’s Party government; a former managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF); and a partner at Lazard, the prestigious international investment bank. As Simona Levi put it, “He was untouchable, the Margaret Thatcher of Spain, a god for Spanish conservatives, the destroyer of workers’ rights to his enemies, with vast influence, and the architect of the neoliberal policies followed by Spain and other countries.” Under his watch in May 2012 Bankia announced profits of 328 million euros. Then, abruptly, Bankia went bust. Two weeks after Rato had announced Bankia’s profits, he resigned. Under pressure from the Bank of Spain, profit became a loss of more than 4 billion euros. A year later, it would be revised again to a gigantic 19 billion euros, an unimaginable reversal in the accounts for such a large financial institution. This was “the biggest financial debacle in Spanish history,” according to the newspaper El País. The Spanish government took control once more and Bankia was bailed out to the tune of more than 23 billion euros, a figure that has recently been revised upwards—to 46 billion euros. It was the biggest bailout ever of a Spanish financial institution, paid for by taxpayers in Spain and Europe. The deal rode roughshod over Spanish regulations that protect investors: Tragically, almost all of Bankia’s small investors ended up losing most of their money, a loss estimated to be close to 2 billion euros. It was this total reversal in the company accounts that raised suspicions in Levi’s mind, and also galvanized the other members of Xnet. They started with two basic questions. First, the dramatic collapse of Bankia’s share price from about 3.75 euros when it was first listed, to 2.07 euros a year later to 0.01 euros or virtually nothing in just two years, suggested someone hadn’t been telling the truth about the state of the bank when its savers were persuaded to buy Bankia shares. Second, if Bankia’s bailout had absorbed one-seventh of the total amount spent on bailing out the Spanish economy, the managers of the bank must have had ample warning that something was wrong. Levi told me that all she really did was ask why, a question she has been asking since she was a child. “Why did the bank collapse?” Simona Levi, one of the founders of 15 MpaRato, an organization created to investigate Bankia’s collapse, protests at an anti-austerity rally, Plaça de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain, May 2012. (CC BY-SA 2.0) Soon after their meeting in the bar, Levi took the microphone at a huge anti-austerity rally at Plaça de Catalunya (Catalonia Square) in Barcelona in May 2012, announced to those assembled that a group, called 15 MpaRato, had been created to investigate the bank’s collapse, and asked for others to join their efforts. Photographs of the demonstration show a thoughtful, confident, striking woman in a black dress with a print of big red and white flowers. In front of a huge, enthusiastic crowd she announced that they would sue Bankia’s former chairman, Rodrigo Rato, and his accomplices at Bankia. In truth Levi had little evidence, but standing on the platform, thrilled by the response of thousands of people, she called on victims to come forward, appealing to the crowd for evidence and support. The campaign was launched. Levi and the others on the team set out a five-year plan to succeed in convicting Rodgrigo Rato by 2017. * * * Spanish law allows individual citizens or groups to file criminal complaints for review by the court if they believe a law has been broken, regardless of whether they were personally affected. Levi and her Xnet network began by presenting, via lawyers, their two fundamental questions about the workings of Bankia to National Court Judge Fernando Andreu on June 14, 2012. Once he agreed to investigate and seek evidence on his own accord, as is not unusual in Spain, Simona and colleagues continued gathering information to support their case. They also made sure they were part of the case, rather than merely providing evidence and information. They used a variety of approaches. First they worked with lawyers to locate a number of small savers who believed they’d been personally defrauded by the bank but couldn’t say how. Hundreds of citizens also began submitting information online. Evidence that Levi and her friends thought might take a year to gather was collected in just two weeks. The 15MpaRato activists helped analyze the material, and sent it to journalists and lawyers. They also published it online, allowing the public to analyze and share the information themselves. At the same time 15MpaRato launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds to pay for their lawsuit. In just 24 hours, much to Levi’s surprise and delight, they had raised 130 percent of their goal (15,000 euros). The campaign against Bankia quickly became a thriving network. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Xnet’s lawsuit against Rodrigo Rato initially represented 15 people, but grew to 44. Their case was based on five main allegations related to deliberate misinformation, forgery, and fraud. Levi told me that the people who came to them, without exception, had very sad stories. Many of them were pensioners with few savings who had trusted what Levi called “the smart young men in the bank,” and felt humiliated and stupid. Throughout the years Levi worked with this group of people, all of them assumed, as she did, they would never get their money back; they just wanted justice. In early July 2012, after considering the evidence, as well as evidence from others, including one of Spain’s smaller political parties, Judge Andreu indicted Rodrigo Rato and 33 other board members of the bank as well as its parent company as targets of an investigation into alleged financial crimes in the run-up to the bank’s collapse. It was a good start, but 15 MpaRato’s work was far from finished. Levi and the others on the team continued to investigate and in 2013 created an online tool, Xnet Leaks, inspired by Wikileaks. The tool was designed to ensure anonymity for people who wanted to submit information about Rato and others. It works like this: Anyone with information—someone with a complaint or a whistle-blower—is ensured anonymity by accessing the TOR network. This is software that conceals his or her IP address. According to Levi about 10 percent of what they receive is judged to be worth following up on and it is sent to a second mailbox that other Xnet members can access without seeing the original sender’s identity. Then the information or the allegations are handed over to the Spanish media so journalists can probe deeper—and also to legal experts so they can assemble evidence for the ongoing court case. As Simona Levi put it, “It’s an evolution and a domestic adaptation of what we learned from Wikileaks. Less than one year into their five-year plan, by May 2013, they had circulated over 4,000 processed leaks and pieces of evidence, along with jokes and pictures. Important information came in from multiple sources, including Bankia employees. Judge Andreu expanded his investigation from the alleged fraudulent sale of shares at the time of Bankia’s flotation and opened a second front as a result of the leaks the activists had received. He now began investigating how the two biggest banks in the Bankia conglomerate in addition had sold one financial product in particular: “preferentes” or preferred shares to small savers for over 10 years. Preferred shares are complex, high-risk financial products that can legally be sold only to people with demonstrated financial knowledge, after the risks had been explained to them. Some workers in Bankia leaked an internal document related to the preferred shares, which had been circulated to managers and branches, and which explained how to encourage small savers to buy these preferred shares. Printed on every page was a notice that read: “This information should not be visible to customers.” Despite the fact that these shares are considered to be suitable only for experienced investors, it later emerged that some who sunk their investments into the Bankia scheme were so poorly educated that they had to sign the contract with a fingerprint. A source within the National Stock Exchange Commission leaked an internal commission document to 15MpaRato showing how small savers were encouraged to buy these preferentes with intentionally misleading information. Judge Andreu now had evidence of falsified accounts and information related to the public offering of bank shares, and, in addition, evidence of a 10-year history of bank customers’ being deliberately misled into risky products. Levi and her group were able to ask him to initiate criminal proceedings against Bankia, based on Article 282 bis of the Spanish Criminal Court, which covers fraud and misrepresentation in connection with the sale of securities. Judge Andreu agreed, thanks to leaks received by Levi and her colleagues. In Spain, violating Article 282 is punishable with up to six years imprisonment. Judge Andreu then commissioned a report by two experts at the Bank of Spain who later were to reaffirm that there were inconsistencies in the published information regarding Bankia’s flotation and in later reports of the bank’s accounts—and that they were falsified by Rato and his successor, who had been aware of it and had deliberately concealed it. * * * Further explosive revelations were to follow, opening up yet another investigation. In December 2013, about 18 months into Levi’s five-year plan, the media and citizens learned about the contents of around 8000 e-mails from Caja Madrid (as noted previously, the largest of the seven small banks that united to form Bankia), which were leaked to 15MpaRato—“another extremely useful source” as Levi put it matter-of-factly. The huge tranche of e-mails, and the scandal itself became known as the “Blesa’s e-mails” or the “Blesa black-card case,” after Miguel Blesa, effectively Rodrigo Rato’s predecessor at the bank. “Blesa’s e-mails” revealed that when Miguel Blesa was in charge, and during the transition to the leadership of Rodrigo Rato, bank executives used corporate credit cards to spend some 15 million euros of bank money on luxury goods, lavish holidays, and even petty supermarket purchases. Rodrigo Rato himself, the e-mails reveal, misused his company credit card, making 159 purchases between October 24, 2010 and November 28, 2011, spending almost 100,000 euros on alcoholic beverages, shoes, and tailoring; in restaurants and garden centers and elsewhere. They also showed that two days before he quit as chairman of Bankia, Rato took out 1,000 euros in cash on his corporate credit card. The e-mails reveal personal greed, but also that political favors, loans, and bribes were paid—and that political parties and trade unions were aware of this and took the funds from the bank regardless: Eighty-six people from every main political party and trade union were in receipt of the bank’s cash. To Levi, the details of such payoffs were “extremely significant,” starkly revealing “the complicity between politics and money, the hypocrisy and corruption at the top—the way the system really works in Spain.” Rodrigo Rato, former director of the International Monetary Fund and head of Bankia, steps into a car after a court hearing, Madrid, Spain, February 19, 2016. (Reuters / Juan Medina) Xnet Leaks facilitated access to Blesa’s e-mails through an online search engine so that journalists, researchers, lawyers, and citizens could discover the true story as narrated in e-mail exchanges between Bankia’s board of directors. Judge Andreu agreed to investigate the existence of the so-called “black cards” as part of the Bankia case, adding a third strand to his investigations. Opening this third front in Judge Andreu’s investigation, the Blesa e-mails, was possible once again due to the work of Levi and her network. In fact, former Bankia executives faced a deluge of court cases. From the moment Levi and 15 MpaRato announced its public campaign against Bankia, other serious allegations of corruption at the bank quickly floated to the surface; it was as if the genie was out of the bottle. One case, following the 15MpaRato’s initiative, was brought by one of Spain’s smaller political parties, Union, Progress, and Democracy (UPyD), and launched on July 4 2012. They accused 33 former Bankia executives (including Rato) of fraud, price-fixing, and falsifying accounts. The Spanish government itself started its investigation only after Xnet acted, announcing that it was launching a criminal investigation into Bankia in July 2012. And the Spanish Association of Minority Shareholder Listed Companies collected thousands of individual complaints from Bankia shareholders and launched a separate lawsuit against former directors for misinforming investors. There currently are other active lawsuits against Bankia, including one against Blesa and 20 others who are charged with fraud and other allegations related to the granting of mortgages between 2003 and 2009. Levi’s original idea hatched in a dark Barcelona bar a year before had triggered an avalanche of disclosures that revealed the rotten core of one of Spain’s largest banks. The law was closing in. Judge Andreu assigned liability for the credit-card abuse to Rato and Blesa, and in October 2014 the former bankers and accomplices had to put up their own property (a total of 19 million euros) in personal bail. Rato was ordered to pay a bond of 3 million euros. He was also forced to resign from the People’s Party. On April 16, 2015, Rato was briefly placed under arrest for alleged fraud, embezzlement, and money laundering—as a result of a separate investigation by another judge in a different court into suspected tax fraud, again triggered by the main case. According to information leaked to the Spanish media by court sources, he is reported to have amassed a personal fortune using a web of companies and over 70 bank accounts. The judge overseeing this investigation ordered the freezing of all Rato’s bank accounts, and in October 2015 his passport was confiscated. He denies wrongdoing, and this case also continues. In early 2016 there was another development in the Blesa-e-mails strand of the case. Judge Andreu and Spanish prosecutors filed charges against 66 individuals related to the case, demanding a jail sentence of four and a half years for Rato, six years for Blesa, and multimillion-euro fines for each. The trial opened a month ago on September 26; both deny wrongdoing, and this case continues, too. On February 17 of this year, Bankia announced it would refund hundreds of thousands of savers who lost most or all of their money because of the bank’s disastrous—and dubious—efforts to shore up its books five years before. This announcement followed quickly on the heels of a Supreme Court decision a few weeks earlier that Bankia had to return the money to two such customers because they had been “intentionally misled,” the court said, by the bank during its ill-fated IPO in 2011. The bank clearly saw the writing on the wall and, in an effort to avoid thousands of potentially expensive lawsuits, it has now offered an out of court settlement to the hundreds of thousands of others. The loss to these ordinary savers has been estimated to be close to 2 billion euros, and so far about 1.2 billion euros has been paid out. Thanks to the work of Simona Levi and a network of activists and supporters, hundreds of thousands of small savers are getting their money (plus interest) back, crooked bankers and even politicians may be jailed and systemic corruption exposed. As Simona Levi put it, “Bankia was a fraud, and we, the people are winning. None of the savers we worked with throughout these years has ever mentioned money, but it is important that we can help many people who have been scammed to recover what is their money, thanks to the evidence we have made available to all.” And who exactly will pay the bill of about nearly 2 billion euros to compensate savers? Bankia will stump up some of it, but the Spanish government still owns nearly two-thirds of Bankia’s equity. So Bankia’s wholly state-owned parent bank BFA will cover most of the bill. In short, the taxpayers of a country still severely affected by the crash and with an economy remaining far below pre-crisis levels will pay yet again—a fact Bankia’s new chairman likes to gloss over. Rafael Hilario Gomez, 41, celebrates with activists from the Mortgage Victims Platform (PAH) outside a branch of Bankia after learning that his eviction has been suspended, Madrid, Spain, September 13, 2013. (Reuters / Juan Medina) * * * For Simona Levi and other activists who worked on the Bankia case, all the targets in their five-year plan have been reached—or nearly reached—well ahead of schedule. But Levi says their work on this case is not yet over. For one, the cases have not been closed and they are watching proceedings in the Madrid courtroom very closely. Levi and her fellow activists would also like to see the regulators held responsible—but that would be an expensive venture. She believes the government itself should be called to account for the Bankia fiasco. As she says this to me she waves a hand dismissively and lets out a deep sigh. But then she smiles. There is also the unsettling thought of the millions of euros they could be liable for if they lose their case. Levi remains optimistic on that score and tries to focus on “the beautiful things we could do if we win and our costs are paid.” Levi continues to run projects and to teach, as before, and she is setting up a Master’s program in law because it has proved so difficult to find lawyers with the relevant training to work on the Bankia case. But what she is most focused on now is the play she wrote and is directing based on the Bankia saga. She is a theater director, after all. Levi told me that the story is Shakespearean and had to be given back to the citizens of Spain and elsewhere. The play’s title is Hazte Banquero—Become a Banker—a quote from an advertising slogan used by Bankia to flog its dodgy shares to its small savers. It opened in July and has been packing in audiences as it tours the country. An English version has been completed, and discussions are taking place about whether to proceed with a play or film. And, of course, Levi and her network continue to work on other cases—the e-mails keep coming in. The story of how a group of organized citizen activists brought a huge bank and key members of the Spanish elite to account is relevant to the ongoing debate about the role of the Internet in social change. For Xnet and 15 MpaRato activists the digital media are critical not only for communication and organization but a also as a way to effectively and securely link individual citizens with evidence of corruption—whistle-blowers, in effect—to journalists and to lawyers, in order to fight impunity and restore democracy. Simona Levi puts it this way: “By creating 15MpaRato, and lodging a complaint that moved the Bankia case forward, and a year later with the leak of Blesa’s e-mails, the documents that brought to light the ‘Bankia black credit cards’ scandal that involved all the political parties and main trade unions in Spain, we’ve learned many things. But one of them was completely unexpected: It isn’t so difficult to indict bankers and politicians. What is difficult is to communicate to a wider public that it wasn’t members of the elite that brought this case to court but normal, everyday people. Normal, everyday people can take on the banks and win.” 2 Comments Facebook Twitter Email Print Anne Koch Anne Koch is an expert on corruption.

Upon completion of the Merger, the Company will become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Danone. The Merger remains subject to receipt of necessary regulatory approvals and other customary conditions. The Company and Danone continue to work with the relevant entities to obtain regulatory clearance and approval. The Company currently expects closing to occur in the first quarter of 2017; however, there can be no assurance regarding the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals or the completion of the Merger. In connection with the Merger, the Company is making the consent solicitation at the request and expense of Danone. The consent solicitation will expire at 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on November 21, 2016, unless terminated or extended by the Company (the “Expiration Date”). The consent solicitation is conditioned on the receipt of valid (and not validly revoked) consents from holders of 2022 Notes as of 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on November 11, 2016 (the “Record Date”) of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2022 Notes, voting together as a single class.

The primary purpose of the Consent Solicitation is to amend the indenture governing the 2022 Notes (the “Indenture”) to modify the reporting covenants with respect to the 2022 Notes so that, from and after the closing of the Merger, in the event that (and for so long as) Danone provides an unconditional guarantee of the Company’s payment obligations under the Indenture and the 2022 Notes, Danone will provide its periodic and current reporting (under applicable French law) in lieu of the Company’s existing periodic and current reporting obligations, which reporting obligations will not be applicable at any time and for any period during which such guarantee is in force.  The proposed amendments will also add provisions, in the event that Danone guarantees the Company’s payment obligations under the Indenture and the 2022 Notes, regarding the unconditional guarantee by Danone thereof, and revise certain definitions, including, inter alia, revising the definition of “Change of Control” to provide that the Merger (and each transaction in connection therewith or related thereto) shall not constitute a Change of Control so long as Danone provides an unconditional guarantee of the Company’s payment obligations under the Indenture and the 2022 Notes.  Danone has no obligation to guarantee the 2022 Notes.  There can be no assurance that Danone will provide such guarantee. The consent solicitation may be amended, extended, abandoned or terminated at the option of the Company.

"His bias in terms of policy from an economist's standpoint is very much inflation, inflation, inflation." "Infrastructure, deficit spending, protectionism, immigration reform; everything he's mentioned so far is going to push prices higher in the U.S.," Hui said. "If you block immigrants, or even illegal immigrants working in the states, wages will rise. If you think about trade policy, if you block Chinese exports to the U.S. prices will rise." Expectations of higher inflation would in turn boost expectations that interest rates would climb, which would likely attract inflows into the U.S. dollar. Hui expected that the Federal Reserve would hike interest rates at its December meeting. That was likely to push up U.S. bond yields, helping to drive further flows into the dollar. Other analysts also said they expected higher U.S. rates and a stronger dollar. "December is baked in the cake," Ray Attrill, co-head of foreign-exchange strategy at National Australia Bank, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Monday. But Attrill added that the market appeared to only be pricing in around 45 basis points of Fed hikes though to the end of 2017, including the expected 25 basis-point increase next month.  "Given what's happening with inflation expectations, given what the bond market signal is there, if the market's half right about inflation expectations and inflation next year, then that is probably going to be the next shoe to drop as far as U.S. interest rates are concerned," he said. Attrill expected short-term interest rates would continue creeping higher, pulling the dollar along for the ride. In the wake of last week's election outcome, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield (US10Y) climbed above 2 percent from levels below 1.80 percent in the days before the result. "Seeing those shorter rates creeping higher, I think is something we should be braced for and that's something that brings in its wake a still firmer U.S. dollar," Attrill said. —By CNBC.Com's Leslie Shaffer; Follow her on Twitter@LeslieShaffer1 Go to MSN Home More in Money 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney 12 leaders who took $1 salaries Money What Trump's win could mean for older Americans CBS News 30 things you should never buy without a coupon GOBankingRates 6 brand mascots that actually existed in real life Business Insider 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money Up Next The most dangerous states in America 24/7 Wall St. AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More from CNBC CNBC View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

Rees, global head of equity strategy at JPMorgan Private Bank, said Trump's plan could be a major hurdle to bond proxies, or companies in industries like telecommunications and utilities, as well as parts of the consumer staples sector. "The companies that don't really grow that pay a high yield, those are the companies we want to avoid here," Rees told CNBC's "Squawk Box." Still, considering Trump's promises for significant tax reform, repatriation of capital and rebuilding infrastructure nationwide, Rees said there may be good opportunities for upside regardless of how quickly rates rise. "The market is definitely focusing on the pro-growth, positive parts of the plan," said Rees.

Privacy Policy. Submit Please enter a valid email address Economist Steven Ricchiuto had a slightly more cautious view of December's expected hike. He said the Federal Reserve could overreact and raise rates too quickly in response to the president-elect's massive spending proposals. "All I know about these moves is they tend to move quicker, they tend to move further than anyone anticipates, and they create a very, very good opportunity on the other side, and they do take [an] economic hostage along the way," the chief U.S. economist at Mizuho Securities told "Squawk Box." The economic hostage would be the U.S. budget deficit of $616 billion, which Ricchiuto said could affect long-term interest rates if Trump adds billions to it through his proposed infrastructure spending. "I'm going to accumulate cash, see what happens with the Fed in December, see what they tell us about 2017," Ricchiuto said.

The dollar, which is at its strongest in nearly a year, has been roaring higher since Republican Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election on November 8. That triggered a massive sell-off in Treasuries, with investors expecting Trump's policies to ramp up domestic inflation. MSCI's emerging market equity index slipped nearly 1 percent on the day and has tumbled nearly 7 percent since the U.S. election. Markets in Asia tallied up heavy losses and stocks in Turkey and Russia fell around 0.8 percent. The most widely used emerging market hard-currency bond index, JPMorgan's EMBI Global Diversified Index, showed the premium investors demanded over U.S. Treasuries widened 4 basis points. The index has risen nearly 20 basis points since the U.S. election. Currencies also weakened. The Mexican peso, which has become a lightning rod for market anxiety, slipped 1.5 percent against the dollar. Russia's rouble and the Turkish lira traded 1 percent weaker. “The general gist is that investors are trying to figure what he is going to do as president,” said Cristian Maggio, head of emerging markets strategy at TD Securities. “No one has a clear answer to that question. We don't expect all his pledges to be implemented.” Asian currencies fared little better. Malaysia's ringgit traded near 10-month lows and China's yuan slipped 0.5 percent after the central bank dropped the trading midpoint to its weakest rate since September 2009. Meanwhile, a raft of data pointed to a stabilisation in the world's second largest economy, though there were some clouds ahead. Fixed-asset investment quickened slightly and beat expectations in January-October as the government stepped up infrastructure spending to support growth. “China's economy is at risk with his election, in particular that (Trump) would want to label China a currency manipulator,” TD Securities' Maggio said. “This is going to add strains to trade and diplomatic relations.” Egypt's pound proved the exception, strengthening around 1 percent to just over 15 to the dollar after Cairo won International Monetary Fund approval late on Friday for a three-year, $12 billion bailout program aimed at reviving a struggling economy, bringing down public debt and controlling inflation. Across central and eastern Europe, currencies hovered broadly flat against the euro after having traded near or at multi-month lows on Friday. REUTERS Hungry for more business news?

Published Mon, Nov 14, 2016  |  David Dittman, Editorial Director Donald Trump shocked the world with his victory in the U.S. presidential contest. He’s about to shock voters with his Establishment-flavored personnel and policy priorities. As we noted in last Friday’s issue, Donald Trump recognized the requirement that to govern in the United States, first you have to win an election. And the work he did to put together a winning coalition is genius level. He basically flipped the Obama hope-and-change script, turning Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin from blue to red by stoking a mix of anger and fear. I’ve seen this expression already, as I’m sure many of you have, probably in some social media meme. It’s another monumental culture-referencing color change: Orange is indeed the new black. The mainstream media and a large segment of the electorate would say he’s an idiot-savant. Nevertheless, today he’s Mr. President-elect. No longer on the campaign trail, he’s now preparing to go inside the Beltway. And my, things have changed… again. Let’s start with a genuinely constructive — magnanimous, even — tweet the president-elect issued early last Friday morning, in the wake of multiple protests around the country: Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud! At the same time, some of Trump’s main people and major policies may surprise his most vocal partisans. Indeed, as Winston Churchill said to Joseph Stalin while discussing the Allied invasion of Europe during the 1943 Tehran Conference, “In wartime, truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.” Nevertheless, today he’s Mr. President-elect. No longer on the campaign trail, he’s now preparing to go inside the Beltway. So, too, the way-cagier-than-we-thought Trump seems to be demonstrating, in politics. Voters pissed at the Establishment and anxious about a future when the recent past has already left them behind might be — should be — alarmed by at least one of the names floated for a top slot in this newest, most critical Trump corporation. It’s Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), late of American Express Co. (AXP) and Citigroup (C), once a potential nominee for Treasury Secretary in the first Obama administration, and now, according to CNBC, a potential nominee for Treasury Secretary in the first Trump administration. He’s a consummate Wall Street elitist — indeed, the capo di tutti capi (“boss of all bosses”) up there. Alan “Ace” Greenberg, the late Bear Stearns chairman and CEO and “one of the most illustrious Wall Street personalities of all time,” once said when asked about attempts to rein in Wall Street, “I feel about Dodd’s bill and the other legislation, exact how Jamie Dimon feels.” And how was that? “I don’t know, but however he feels is how I feel.” Warren Buffett wrote the foreword to Greenberg’s 1996 book, Memos From a Chairman, a collection of his famous notes to employees. He wrote, “Ace Greenberg does almost everything better than I do: bridge, magic tricks, dog training, arbitrage — all of the important things in life.” “If Alan represents me on something, nobody else is going to know about it. He’s extremely close-mouthed.” That was Donald Trump praising Greenberg, who attended the president-elect’s 1993 wedding to Marla Maples. Though he hasn’t passed through it (yet) himself, Dimon, who also served on the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, knows how to meet, greet, and treat those who travel the Wall Street-Washington, D.C., wormhole. Signs of a moderating appeared during Trump’s first moments in public as president-elect. He was stunningly gracious toward “Crooked” Hillary Clinton. And one of the first things he mentioned in his victory speech, from a policy perspective, was “infrastructure” — which, by the way, was a cornerstone of Clinton’s economic plan. Signs of a moderating appeared during Trump’s first moments in public as president-elect. “We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals,” said Trump. “We’re going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.” We’ll see how much of that gets through a Congress populated by “movement conservatives” fixed on “small government,” cutting spending, and managing a budget like a household must. But maybe those were only Obama-era principles. Still, combined with Trump’s commitment to cutting taxes and boosting defense spending, a top-of-mind focus on “highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals” spells more debt and bigger deficits. Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose. (“The more it changes, the more it’s the same thing.”) “Second to none” infrastructure, in addition to Trump’s items, should include an expanded effort to build a hack-proof quantum network. As we detailed in the October 31 Wall Street Daily column, China is making impressive progress toward such a communications system. According to the University of Waterloo Institute for Quantum Computing, “Quantum computing is essentially harnessing and exploiting the amazing laws of quantum mechanics to process information.” And it has the potential to neuter those who would perpetrate the types of cyber-attacks that crippled the internet on October 21 with a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on one of the largest Domain Name System (DNS) service providers in the world. It will help us secure the Internet of Things, which is expanding at an incredibly rapid pace and opening up vulnerabilities at a similarly incredible pace. Still, combined with Trump’s commitment to cutting taxes and boosting defense spending, a top-of-mind focus on “highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals” spells more debt and bigger deficits. It’s also a matter of national security, a way to harden communications infrastructure against nation-states, terrorists, and criminals who, in an era of “blended threats,” combine to penetrate government and corporate networks to do us harm. On top of what we reported on October 31, IEEE Spectrum reported on November 8 that researchers at MIT and Harvard have taken what may be another “significant step toward realizing quantum computing.” According to a paper published November 3 in the journal Science: The realization of large-scale fully controllable quantum systems is an exciting frontier in modern physical science. We use atom-by-atom assembly to implement a platform for the deterministic preparation of regular one-dimensional arrays of individually controlled cold atoms. In our approach, a measurement and feedback procedure eliminates the entropy associated with probabilistic trap occupation and results in defect-free arrays of over 50 atoms in less than 400 milliseconds. The technique is based on fast, real-time control of 100 optical tweezers, which we use to arrange atoms in desired geometric patterns and to maintain these configurations by replacing lost atoms with surplus atoms from a reservoir. This bottom-up approach may enable controlled engineering of scalable many-body systems for quantum information processing, quantum simulations, and precision measurements. The big leap forward here is that using “optical tweezers” enabled the use of neutral atoms, or atoms with no electrical charge. Qubit particles — until now the basis of quantum computing — are much easier to trap due to their charge. But neutral atoms can be placed closer together. And the MIT-Harvard team has also solved the problem of trapping them using a laser beam. As IEEE Spectrum notes: Once the atoms are trapped in this way, they begin to emit light, making it possible for a charged-coupled-device (CCD) camera to capture an image of it. From the images, the researchers were able to determine which of the laser beams had successfully captured an atom and which were empty. The researchers were able to essentially switch off those beams that did not have an atom by selecting certain radio frequencies. In those beams’ place, they put the ones with atoms, yielding a defect-free array of atoms. In this way, the researchers achieved a maximum of 50 atoms that were held in place for a few seconds. A neutral atom can complete 100,000 quantum operations per second. The next step is establishing quantum gates, or “logic operations that occur between two quantum bits that are similar to logic gates in regular computer circuits,” using neutral atoms. This would be a first. A guy like Donald Trump oughta be able to see the genius in all this. Upticks, Downticks Yes, it’s a (ridiculously) small sample size, but the Trump Era has so far been incredibly kind to small-cap stocks. The Russell 2000 has posted a 7.2% rally over the three trading days since it became clear that Donald Trump would win the presidency. The main small-cap index is now just 14 points away from its all-time high of 1,296. According to the November 8 U.S. Department of Labor’s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report, the seasonally adjusted layoff rate slipped to a record low of 1.474 million in September from 1.692 million in August and 1.842 million a year ago. But the hiring rate was also lower, at a seasonally adjusted 5.081 million, down from 5.268 million in August and 5.131 million a year ago. According to FactSet, as of November 11, with 91% of S&P 500 companies reporting, 71% have reported earnings above the mean estimate and 55% have reported sales above the mean estimate. The blended earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 is 2.9%. This is the first time the S&P 500 has posted year-over-year earnings growth since the first quarter of 2015. The Labor Department reported on November 10 that seasonally adjusted initial claims for unemployment insurance were down by 11,000 to 254,000 for the week ending November 5. Analysts were expecting 260,000. The University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for November surged 5.0% from October to 91.6, its highest level since mid-2016, on an improved outlook for the economy. The Sentiment Index is 0.3% higher than it was a year ago. The Chicago Board of Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX), often cited as the “Fear Gauge,” has eased back to 14.74, a decline of 34.5% from a Friday, November 4, close of 22.51. The 2016 Presidential Election Campaign is over. The 2020 Presidential Election Campaign is just getting started. No more “First Lady Bill Clinton” jokes. No more “First Lady Bill Clinton” jokes.

Trump’s victory poses a major challenge to the conventional wisdom on the global economy, which for years has relied on brisker cross-border trade and migration flows for growth. Apart from a nearly across-the-board rise in sovereign bond yields, however, the markets have so far mostly shrugged off the election result — despite previous fears of a meltdown in the event of victory for Trump, who espoused fiercely protectionist positions on trade in his campaign. Even the long-held view that the Federal Reserve will raise rates next month, a year after its initial step in that direction, hasn’t budged at all. Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s testimony to Congress on Thursday may set the stage for a year-end hike, despite the mild tightening in financial conditions in the past week. Everything is up for reassessment. “It will take time to gauge the global economic consequences of Donald Trump’s surprise victory,” JP Morgan’s Chief Global Economist Bruce Kasman wrote in a note. “Forthcoming policy changes are likely to generate growth cross-currents, but they should reinforce the tilt towards global reflation.” Trump’s proposals represent both a negative supply shock from curbs on trade and immigration as well as a positive demand shock from new fiscal spending, he added. With the US economy close to full employment — the jobless rate was 4.9 per cent in October — Trump’s election promise to cut taxes and upgrade the country’s ageing infrastructure could provide a big boost to both growth and inflation. Official US data on Thursday will likely show consumer price index inflation picked up slightly last month, up 0.4 per cent on the month and 1.6 per cent on the same month last year. Core inflation, which strips out food and energy, is expected to hit 2.2 per cent. That follows pre-election news of a pickup in average pay growth to 2.8 per cent, the highest since June 2009. Retail sales data due out on Tuesday are expected to have lost a little steam last month. INFLATION AHOY Sovereign bond markets are already out of the blocks in pricing in a rise in inflation expectations in the United States followed by the rest of the world. The 10-year US yield rose to 2.15 per cent, almost 30 basis points above its levels around 1.86 per cent just before the US election on Tuesday. The surge has strengthened the dollar against the euro and yen, which would ultimately help raise import costs in the euro zone and Japan. If inflation moves higher from here, supported by fiscal stimulus and rising energy prices, the current back-up in bond yields across the developed world is set to continue, possibly suggesting an end to a three-decade trend of falling yields. It is still early days, however. Starting on Monday, it will become clearer how industrialized economies such as the euro zone, Germany, Italy, and Japan fared in the third quarter —before the US political earthquake. Reuters polls show growth largely held steady in the euro zone despite a slowdown in Germany, and picked up slightly in Japan. Inflation was probably 0.5 per cent in October in the euro area, similar to a preliminary reading but above recent lows. The gradual rise in inflation in recent months will be welcome news for the European Central Bank which, after printing more than a trillion euros since March 2015 and cutting deposit rates to -0.4 per cent, is fast seen running out of policy tools. The ECB’s Governing Council next meets on December 8 to decide policy. Economists expect it to extend its asset purchase programme beyond the planned end date of March 2017. YELLEN’S FUTURE A snap Reuters poll conducted in the 24 hours after the US election result indicated no change at all in the expected future path for the policy rate. A series of Fed policymakers are scheduled to speak in the coming week and are likely to reinforce the view that the fed funds rate will move up 25 basis points to a range of 0.50-0.75 at the December 13-14 meeting. Crucial too for the rate trajectory is the future of Janet Yellen, appointed by President Obama as Fed Chair. A Reuters poll a few days ago found a majority of economists expect Yellen to serve out the remainder of her term until early 2018 but don’t think she will be reappointed. “What is relatively clear is that there will be conflicts between a Trump administration and Fed Chair Janet Yellen after Trump had severely attacked Yellen in his election campaign. The bridges between both of them appear to have been burnt,” Jorg Kramer, Chief Economist at Commerzbank, wrote to clients. Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May is scheduled to travel to Berlin on November 18, a trip in which she possibly hopes to get preliminary talks underway that would help the UK smoothly navigate the process of leaving the European Union. — Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Gulf money won’t leave the United States after all Zain Saudi told to pay rival Mobily $58.5m by arbitration panel → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent Muscat Governor hosts reception on 46th National Day Council celebrates National Day School students mark National Day Cruise tourism opens up new job vistas Read More ...

Picture: John Locher / AP Related Articles Will Donald Trump turn his back on Africa? Sizing up foreign policy clues – Peter Vale Friends & Friction: We must exploit our business talent Rand set for biggest weekly slump since August Dollar’s Trump-inspired surge sets off intervention Emerging markets extend post-Trump slump Trump vow to crack down on China set to run into complex reality   New York - The selloff in emerging markets after Donald Trump’s US presidential election was intense. A closer look reveals that things aren’t as bad as they might seem. While local-currency bonds suffered their biggest losses last week since 2008 following the Republican’s surprise victory, a gauge of volatility in developing-market currencies remained 16% below the levels seen in February. The cost to hedge against foreign-exchange losses is 38% cheaper than it was in August 2015 when China’s yuan devaluation rattled global investors. In a global bond selloff fuelled by expectations that Trump will increase government spending, emerging-market traders are by no means capitulating. While bracing for the risks of protectionist policies, they’re betting faster growth and narrowing current account deficits will help most developing countries weather the rout. The recent declines have “created a great buying opportunity,” said Koon Chow, a strategist at Union Bancaire Privee Ubp SA in London. “We could get to the stage where, in one or two weeks’’ time, US Treasury yields stabilise, and if that happens, emerging markets will come back.” While it’s too early to call a bottom, Chow said domestic bonds in Brazil and Russia start to look attractive, together with the Colombian and Peruvian currencies. Asian exchange rates are likely to remain under pressure, he said. More than $1.2trn was wiped off the value of global bonds last week as Trump’s win bolstered the view that a government spending splurge may accelerate US growth and inflation.  Emerging markets were among the hardest-hit as the real-estate mogul pledged on the campaign trail to pull America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, brand China a currency manipulator and build a wall along the border with Mexico. Restrained selling Since the November 8 election, developing-nation local-currency bonds have tumbled 7.3% through November 11, the biggest three-day slump since October 2008. The decline cut the bonds’ return this year to 8.5%. Investors yanked a record $301m from BlackRock’s $8.9bn emerging-market fixed-income fund on November 10. In the currency market, Mexico’s peso plunged 12% to a record low while the Brazilian real and South Africa’s rand have lost more than 6%. The rand was trading 1.8% lower on Monday by 06:30 at R14.34/$. The selling also extended to Asia on Monday. The Malaysian ringgit sank 0.9% to a nine-month low and South Korea’s won depreciated 0.5% to the weakest since June. The Indonesian rupiah extended declines after falling as much as 3% on Friday, the most on an intraday basis since September 2013. Bank Indonesia said on Friday it was in the market to stabilise the rupiah, adding that outflows were moderate and it expects the slide to be temporary. Bank Negara Malaysia said the monetary authority’s role is to continue managing “extreme volatilities in the ringgit, with no targeted level.” Indian state-run banks sold dollars on behalf of the Reserve Bank, according to two Mumbai-based traders, who asked not to be identified. Still, there are indications that the selloff may be limited. While hedging costs in the currency market increased to a five-month high of 4.3% on Nov. 10, they were lower than those of 6.9% in August 2015, according to data compiled by JPMorgan Chase. At 11.3%, JPMorgan’s gauge of currency volatility is below this year’s high of 13.4% set in February. Stronger fundamentals One reason is that emerging countries are on a stronger footing now compared with three years ago during the so-called taper tantrum when then Federal Reserve chairperson Ben Bernanke’s signal to reduce monetary stimulus sent a shock wave through global markets. Developing-nation local-currency bonds lost about 16% in less than four months. Economic growth is picking up this year for the first time since 2010 with Brazil and Russia digging themselves out of recessions, the International Monetary Fund estimates. The average shortfall of current accounts in South Africa, Brazil, Turkey, India and Indonesia, a group branded as the “fragile five” by Morgan Stanley in 2013, has shrunk to 2.4% of gross domestic product, from a record 5% in 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Foreign reserves have increased in countries including Indonesia and India, providing them with ammunition to defend their currencies. “Fundamentals are much stronger than going into the taper tantrum.” said  Paul McNamara, a money manager at GAM UK Ltd. The selloff “just strikes me as a little bit extreme,” he said. Strategists at Morgan Stanley and Citigroup warn that the rout is likely to deepen. Trump’s protectionist overtures, if acted upon, would slow exports from and reduce investments to developing markets, they say. In addition, central banks in the US, Europe and Japan are either ready to raise borrowing costs or stop easing further, dragging Treasuries yields up and putting pressure on emerging markets, Citigroup’s analyst Dirk Willer wrote in a note on Friday. Local debt in Mexico, Poland and Hungary are most vulnerable to rising US yields, he said. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate that investors are overweighting domestic bonds and have hedged between about 10% and 30% of their currency exposure in Brazil, Indonesia, Russia and South Africa. If the selloff extends, investors may have to cut their holdings and increase their purchases of insurance, exacerbating the decline. For now, McNamara said he’s willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt. He’s looking to buy the South African rand once there’s some clarity about the direction of the new US government. “We just sit tight at the moment,” said McNamara, whose Julius Baer Local Emerging Bond Fund returned 13% this year. “All the negative is based on various assumptions. We’ve got very little hard evidence in terms of what the new administration is going to mean for emerging markets.” Follow Fin24 on Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and Pinterest. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.

Morgan AM&#039;s Tai Hui talks about how expectations for growth and rising inflation have increased in U.S. markets on Donald Trump&#039;s election.</p> How markets have reacted post-election    Sunday, 13 Nov 2016 | 6:23 PM ET | 01:08 The dollar was likely to continue its lurch higher in the wake of the surprise presidential election win by Donald Trump, as inflation was set for a comeback, analysts said. The dollar index, which measures the dollar against a basket of currencies, rose as high as 99.247 in early Asia trade on Monday, from levels below 97 in the days before the U.S. election, which Trump won. Analysts said the market was now pricing in the billionaire businessman's surprise win. "It is very much the market building up expectation or pricing in his election campaign language," Tai Hui, chief Asia market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Monday. "His bias in terms of policy from an economist's standpoint is very much inflation, inflation, inflation." "Infrastructure, deficit spending, protectionism, immigration reform; everything he's mentioned so far is going to push prices higher in the U.S.," Hui said. "If you block immigrants, or even illegal immigrants working in the states, wages will rise. If you think about trade policy, if you block Chinese exports to the U.S. prices will rise." show chapters <p>December rate hike is &#039;baked in the cake&#039;: Expert</p> <p>National Australia Bank&#039;s Ray Attrill and J.P. Morgan AM&#039;s Tai Hui discuss why they think the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates in December.</p> December rate hike is 'baked in the cake': Expert    Sunday, 13 Nov 2016 | 6:48 PM ET | 01:46 Expectations of higher inflation would in turn boost expectations that interest rates would climb, which would likely attract inflows into the U.S. dollar. Hui expected that the Federal Reserve would hike interest rates at its December meeting. That was likely to push up U.S. bond yields, helping to drive further flows into the dollar. Other analysts also said they expected higher U.S. rates and a stronger dollar. "December is baked in the cake," Ray Attrill, co-head of foreign-exchange strategy at National Australia Bank, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Monday. But Attrill added that the market appeared to only be pricing in around 45 basis points of Fed hikes though to the end of 2017, including the expected 25 basis-point increase next month. Alexander Ryumin | TASS | Getty Images "Given what's happening with inflation expectations, given what the bond market signal is there, if the market's half right about inflation expectations and inflation next year, then that is probably going to be the next shoe to drop as far as U.S. interest rates are concerned," he said. Attrill expected short-term interest rates would continue creeping higher, pulling the dollar along for the ride. In the wake of last week's election outcome, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield climbed above 2 percent from levels below 1.80 percent in the days before the result. "Seeing those shorter rates creeping higher, I think is something we should be braced for and that's something that brings in its wake a still firmer U.S. dollar," Attrill said. —By CNBC.Com's Leslie Shaffer; Follow her on Twitter @LeslieShaffer1 Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

Reuters says sources close to the firm confirmed the move. 'Messaging app Snapchat has filed confidentially for an initial public offering (IPO), sources familiar with the situation said on Tuesday,' it claimed.   Scroll down for video  In October, the Wall Street Journal reported Snapchat, founded by Evan Speigel (pictured), could start selling shares as early as late March with a valuation of $25 billion or more. The widely popular messaging app has been rumoured to be preparing to go public for months. In October, the Wall Street Journal reported Snapchat could start selling shares as early as late March with a valuation of $25 billion or more. Snapchat filed papers with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission before last week’s U.S. Presidential election, one of the people said, asking not to be identified as the details are private, Reuters said. The company is targeting a valuation of about $20 billion to $25 billion in a listing that could come as early as March, the person said.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to...

Share this article Share 19 shares No final decision has been made on the size or timing of the IPO, they said. Because Snapchat has revenue of less than $1 billion, it was able to file IPO documents confidentially.  However, it is not clear when Snapchat will publicly unveil the news, when it will begin trading, or how much the company is looking to raise in the offering. Snapchat was valued at nearly $18 billion in its latest round of funding. If is does go forward as planned, it would be the biggest company to go public on a U.S. exchange since 2014 when Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. made its debut at a $168 billion valuation. While its finances are not public, the research firm eMarketer has estimated that Snapchat would generate nearly a billion dollars next year from advertising Snapchat had been talking to investment bankers about an IPO towards the end of this year or early in 2017, technology website The Information reported last month.    While its finances are not public, the research firm eMarketer has estimated that Snapchat would generate nearly a billion dollars next year from advertising.  A September report from eMarketer said: 'Worldwide, it will generate $366.69 million in ad revenues this year, with that figure jumping to $935.46 million in 2017.'   Reports on Snap Inc's IPO come at a time when shares of technology companies such as Square Inc and Box Inc that went public over the last two years are trading below their private market valuation.  Snapchat's valuation has grown in the last few years as the company added advertising and sponsored contents to its messaging service. The glasses are available in three colours: Black, Coral, and Teal, and users can virtually try them on at the vending machines. They can film 10 second video clips and upload them to the picture messaging app The company has told investors to expect $1billion in advertising revenue in 2017, according to sources familiar with the matter. The company received $3.1million in advertising revenue for the first 11 months of 2014, according to financial documents leaked last year. Snapchat is expected to have 58.6million users in the United States by the end of 2016 and that number is expected to jump 13.6 per cent to 66.6million by next year, according to eMarketer. Snap estimates it has more than 100million users globally of the service for sending videos, images and text messages which vanish after being viewed.  Some reports say it generates 10billion video views per day.  Snapchat fans queued for hours to get the to the machine, which is the only way to buy the firm's $129 spectacles.  Snapchat's messaging has been a hit, especially with young people, but it has been broadening offerings to include content from media partners in the hope of expanding use and money-making opportunities.  Snap Inc CEO Evan Spiegel said at a May 2015 tech conference: 'We need to IPO, we have a plan to do that. An IPO is really important.'  The firm is believed to have chosen Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc as lead underwriters for an initial public offering. JPMorgan Chase & Co, Deutsche Bank AG, Allen & Co, Barclays Plc and Credit Suisse Group AG will be joint book runners, the source said, asking not to be named because the information was not yet public.  The company's last round of funding included General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital, T. Rowe Price and Lone Pine. Previous rounds included Fidelity Investment, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Yahoo! Inc.  Huge queues soon formed, and the fuirm covered the machine at one point, before reopening it to continue selling. Around 4:45, Snapchat staff told those in the queue they had run out. The firm last week revealed a vending machine in Venice Beach selling its new product, a $129 pair of glasses. It caused a stampede to the area, and huge queues before staff eventually said they had sold out at around 3:30pm - with glasses already on offer on eBay for $900.   The video specs let users post 10 second video clips and upload them straight to Snapchat. The new gadgets transfer the clips via wi-fi or Bluetooth. Makers of the glasses, simply called Spectacles, say they will create video which is akin to human vision because the lenses have an angle of 115 degrees. People queued around the block, hoping to snag a pair of the Snapchat specs Snapchat announced the product earlier this year, and also revealed it was renaming the company to Snap Inc as it grows to develop further products, stretching beyond the popular app. It says the vending machine will be the only way to buy them - for now. 'The only way to buy Spectacles is through a Snapbot,' the firm said. 'We can’t guarantee the authenticity of Spectacles you buy anywhere else.'  THE SNAPBOT  The firm today revealed a vending machine in Venice Beach selling the $129 specs - and says it is the only place to get them for now. Snapbots said the devices are 'our very own vending machines that dispense Spectacles and never seem to stay in one location for too long' To use them, users press one of the larger circular buttons to virtually try on a pair of Black, Coral, and Teal Specs. When they have chosen a color they insert a debit or credit card to purchase. Snapbots take about 10 seconds to process your transaction.  'Once you see the Bot’s mouth light up, take your Specs and you’re all set!' the firm says.  Spiegel said the device would be rolled out slowly. He told the Wall Street Journal: 'We're going to take a slow approach to rolling them out.  'It's about us figuring out if it fits into people's lives and seeing how they like it.' He said he had tested a prototype while on holiday with his supermodel fiancee Miranda Kerr in California. When I got the footage back and watched it, I could see my own memory, through my own eyes - it was unbelievable. Evan Spiegel  'It was our first vacation, and we went to Big Sur for a day or two. We were walking through the woods, stepping over logs, looking up at the beautiful trees.   'And when I got the footage back and watched it, I could see my own memory, through my own eyes - it was unbelievable. 'It's one thing to see images of an experience you had, but it's another thing to have an experience of the experience. It was the closest I'd ever come to feeling like I was there again.' HOW THEY WORK   To take a Snap, just press the button on Specs once to take a ten-second video. There’s no need to pair Specs with your phone first.  Spectacles are always ‘on’ and ready to capture the moment, but they’re not always recording.  The LED ring on the front of Specs will illuminate when you press the button to start recording. One you pair a phone, the snaps will automatically appear in your memories tab.  From there, they can be edited and shared as normal.  The machine caused a stampede to the area, and huge queues - with glasses already on eBay for $900 Earlier this year Snapchat introduced a range of new filters, called Lenses, that cadd masks, drawings and other features onto selfies. As of June this year 10 billion videos are viewed on the app - a sharp rise from eight billion back in February. It will follow in the footsteps of the hitherto unsuccessful Google Glass, a device launched by Google but beset by problems. The consumer device failed to take off, partly because of privacy concerns and a steep price tag, with wearers of Glass even branded 'Glassholes'. Earlier this year, Google said it was working on a new version of the device.  Read more: Snapchat Releases First Hardware Product, Spectacles - WSJ Google Glass pulled from official Twitter, Instagram and Google+ accounts | Daily Mail Online Snapchat Files Confidentially for IPO - Bloomberg Share or comment on this article e-mail 19 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Girl won right to be frozen just days before dying Scrapped!

Bank of America Corp., BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc., Credit Agricole SA, Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., UBS Group AG and National Bank of Canada are arranging the deal.

Reuters says sources close to the firm confirmed the move. 'Messaging app Snapchat has filed confidentially for an initial public offering (IPO), sources familiar with the situation said on Tuesday,' it claimed.   Scroll down for video  In October, the Wall Street Journal reported Snapchat, founded by Evan Speigel (pictured), could start selling shares as early as late March with a valuation of $25 billion or more. The widely popular messaging app has been rumoured to be preparing to go public for months. In October, the Wall Street Journal reported Snapchat could start selling shares as early as late March with a valuation of $25 billion or more. Snapchat filed papers with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission before last week’s U.S. Presidential election, one of the people said, asking not to be identified as the details are private, Reuters said. The company is targeting a valuation of about $20 billion to $25 billion in a listing that could come as early as March, the person said.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to...

Share this article Share 19 shares No final decision has been made on the size or timing of the IPO, they said. Because Snapchat has revenue of less than $1 billion, it was able to file IPO documents confidentially.  However, it is not clear when Snapchat will publicly unveil the news, when it will begin trading, or how much the company is looking to raise in the offering. Snapchat was valued at nearly $18 billion in its latest round of funding. If is does go forward as planned, it would be the biggest company to go public on a U.S. exchange since 2014 when Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. made its debut at a $168 billion valuation. While its finances are not public, the research firm eMarketer has estimated that Snapchat would generate nearly a billion dollars next year from advertising Snapchat had been talking to investment bankers about an IPO towards the end of this year or early in 2017, technology website The Information reported last month.    While its finances are not public, the research firm eMarketer has estimated that Snapchat would generate nearly a billion dollars next year from advertising.  A September report from eMarketer said: 'Worldwide, it will generate $366.69 million in ad revenues this year, with that figure jumping to $935.46 million in 2017.'   Reports on Snap Inc's IPO come at a time when shares of technology companies such as Square Inc and Box Inc that went public over the last two years are trading below their private market valuation.  Snapchat's valuation has grown in the last few years as the company added advertising and sponsored contents to its messaging service. The glasses are available in three colours: Black, Coral, and Teal, and users can virtually try them on at the vending machines. They can film 10 second video clips and upload them to the picture messaging app The company has told investors to expect $1billion in advertising revenue in 2017, according to sources familiar with the matter. The company received $3.1million in advertising revenue for the first 11 months of 2014, according to financial documents leaked last year. Snapchat is expected to have 58.6million users in the United States by the end of 2016 and that number is expected to jump 13.6 per cent to 66.6million by next year, according to eMarketer. Snap estimates it has more than 100million users globally of the service for sending videos, images and text messages which vanish after being viewed.  Some reports say it generates 10billion video views per day.  Snapchat fans queued for hours to get the to the machine, which is the only way to buy the firm's $129 spectacles.  Snapchat's messaging has been a hit, especially with young people, but it has been broadening offerings to include content from media partners in the hope of expanding use and money-making opportunities.  Snap Inc CEO Evan Spiegel said at a May 2015 tech conference: 'We need to IPO, we have a plan to do that. An IPO is really important.'  The firm is believed to have chosen Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc as lead underwriters for an initial public offering. JPMorgan Chase & Co, Deutsche Bank AG, Allen & Co, Barclays Plc and Credit Suisse Group AG will be joint book runners, the source said, asking not to be named because the information was not yet public.  The company's last round of funding included General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital, T. Rowe Price and Lone Pine. Previous rounds included Fidelity Investment, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Yahoo! Inc.  Huge queues soon formed, and the fuirm covered the machine at one point, before reopening it to continue selling. Around 4:45, Snapchat staff told those in the queue they had run out. The firm last week revealed a vending machine in Venice Beach selling its new product, a $129 pair of glasses. It caused a stampede to the area, and huge queues before staff eventually said they had sold out at around 3:30pm - with glasses already on offer on eBay for $900.   The video specs let users post 10 second video clips and upload them straight to Snapchat. The new gadgets transfer the clips via wi-fi or Bluetooth. Makers of the glasses, simply called Spectacles, say they will create video which is akin to human vision because the lenses have an angle of 115 degrees. People queued around the block, hoping to snag a pair of the Snapchat specs Snapchat announced the product earlier this year, and also revealed it was renaming the company to Snap Inc as it grows to develop further products, stretching beyond the popular app. It says the vending machine will be the only way to buy them - for now. 'The only way to buy Spectacles is through a Snapbot,' the firm said. 'We can’t guarantee the authenticity of Spectacles you buy anywhere else.'  THE SNAPBOT  The firm today revealed a vending machine in Venice Beach selling the $129 specs - and says it is the only place to get them for now. Snapbots said the devices are 'our very own vending machines that dispense Spectacles and never seem to stay in one location for too long' To use them, users press one of the larger circular buttons to virtually try on a pair of Black, Coral, and Teal Specs. When they have chosen a color they insert a debit or credit card to purchase. Snapbots take about 10 seconds to process your transaction.  'Once you see the Bot’s mouth light up, take your Specs and you’re all set!' the firm says.  Spiegel said the device would be rolled out slowly. He told the Wall Street Journal: 'We're going to take a slow approach to rolling them out.  'It's about us figuring out if it fits into people's lives and seeing how they like it.' He said he had tested a prototype while on holiday with his supermodel fiancee Miranda Kerr in California. When I got the footage back and watched it, I could see my own memory, through my own eyes - it was unbelievable. Evan Spiegel  'It was our first vacation, and we went to Big Sur for a day or two. We were walking through the woods, stepping over logs, looking up at the beautiful trees.   'And when I got the footage back and watched it, I could see my own memory, through my own eyes - it was unbelievable. 'It's one thing to see images of an experience you had, but it's another thing to have an experience of the experience. It was the closest I'd ever come to feeling like I was there again.' HOW THEY WORK   To take a Snap, just press the button on Specs once to take a ten-second video. There’s no need to pair Specs with your phone first.  Spectacles are always ‘on’ and ready to capture the moment, but they’re not always recording.  The LED ring on the front of Specs will illuminate when you press the button to start recording. One you pair a phone, the snaps will automatically appear in your memories tab.  From there, they can be edited and shared as normal.  The machine caused a stampede to the area, and huge queues - with glasses already on eBay for $900 Earlier this year Snapchat introduced a range of new filters, called Lenses, that cadd masks, drawings and other features onto selfies. As of June this year 10 billion videos are viewed on the app - a sharp rise from eight billion back in February. It will follow in the footsteps of the hitherto unsuccessful Google Glass, a device launched by Google but beset by problems. The consumer device failed to take off, partly because of privacy concerns and a steep price tag, with wearers of Glass even branded 'Glassholes'. Earlier this year, Google said it was working on a new version of the device.  Read more: Snapchat Releases First Hardware Product, Spectacles - WSJ Google Glass pulled from official Twitter, Instagram and Google+ accounts | Daily Mail Online Snapchat Files Confidentially for IPO - Bloomberg Share or comment on this article e-mail 19 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Girl won right to be frozen just days before dying Scrapped!

The Dow Jones industrial average saw its third straight record close, finishing up 0.11 percent to 18,869.69. But the S&P 500 dropped 0.01 percent to 2,164.20, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.36 percent to 5,218.40. “I think all we’re doing is trimming our sails a little from the violently positive rally we had post-election results last week,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. Bank stocks continued to surge, as government bond prices dipped and yields reached their highest levels since January on expectations that Republican President-elect Donald Trump’s spending plans will lead to higher inflation and more government borrowing. “The market is sniffing out the belief that some of these Trump policies may drive some better economic growth, but also may in fact be somewhat inflationary,” PNC chief investment strategist Bill Stone said. Investors also are betting on Trump’s pledge to loosen federal financial regulations and dismantle the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation. Bank of America climbed 5.6 percent to $20.08, while Goldman Sachs rose 2.6 percent to $209.18, and JPMorgan Chase increased 3.7 percent to $79.51. Investors are switching money to sectors such as banking, which has been relatively cheaper but now should benefit from rising interest rates, said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. “If growth becomes more even and available, we may see a continuation of rotation into lower-valuation, more cyclical businesses, and out of high-valuation growth stocks like technology,” said James Abate, chief investment officer at Centre Asset Management in New York. Technology companies, including Apple and Microsoft, fell sharply yesterday on worries also that protectionism trade policies enacted by Trump could hurt their sales in China and other overseas markets. Google parent company Alphabet dropped 2.4 percent to $753.22, and Apple lost 2.5 percent to finish at $105.71. Facebook lost 3.3 percent to end at $115.08, while Microsoft dipped 1.5 percent to $58.12. The tech industry, which largely supported Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s presidential run, may also face higher hurdles for expanding their footprints after some high-profile business leaders, including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, clashed with Trump during the election.

Tim Cook Some are using it as an opportunity to bring their employees together following a divisive election campaign. Others are using it as an opportunity to stress their companies’ values and mission, or an opportunity to make nice with Trump, who many CEOs were publicly against during the campaign. The men and woman who head the nation’s biggest companies know that having a hostile relationship with the Trump administration could make doing business difficult. They also know that they operate in liberal bastions like New York and San Francisco just as much as in Trump-leaning places like Fort Wayne, Indiana, or Charleston, West Virginia. “Neutral is the best policy,” says John Challenger, CEO of workplace consultant Challenger, Gray & Christmas. T-Mobile’s Legere, who long was vocally opposed to Trump, congratulated the president-elect on Twitter for his victory, while holding off on judging the president-elect’s policies. Meanwhile another telecommunications executive, Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure, himself an immigrant and personally opposed to Trump, sent an email to employees saying that “it’s our obligation to accept the will of our fellow Americans and respect the new leader.” It’s possible that Legere and Claure made nice because the president appoints the chairman and commissioners of the Federal Communications Commission, an agency that holds enormous influence over the telecommunications industry. All five FCC commissioners will see their terms expire during Trump’s first term. CEOs of automakers, including Ford’s Mark Fields, have also struck a conciliatory tone, partly because Trump has called for the repeal or renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has allowed the automakers to set up shop in Mexico tariff-free. Many CEOs publicly expressed hope that the tensions dividing the country will diminish, and that American consumers will set aside their fears and get back to what they do best: shop. “We are hoping that in the postelection we are just going to see people ready to spend,” said Marvin Ellison, CEO of JCPenney. CEOs and companies that try to bring people together are “going to be the winners,” says Dr. Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University’s Lubin School of Business. “That always works better from a brand perspective,” he says. Wall Street, which donated heavily to Hillary Clinton, also now faces an administration that could provide both profit and peril. Trump has said he wants to roll back some of the regulations in the Dodd-Frank law that was passed after the financial crisis, a move that would benefit big Wall Street banks. But the Republican Party’s platform also contains a provision calling for the return of the Glass-Steagall Act, a Great Depression-era law that broke up big banks. There’s talk of a massive, $1 trillion infrastructure program that could rely on tax credits to private funding sources. Many of those programs will require Wall Street’s army of investment bankers and lawyers to help underwrite and finance. “The president-elect’s commitment to infrastructure spending, government reform and tax reform — among other things — will be good for growth and, therefore, will be good for our clients and for our firm,” said Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, according to a transcript of a voicemail he sent companywide. In an email to his employees, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the election of Trump shows “the frustration that so many people have with the lack of economic opportunity and the challenges they face.” Trump’s victory drew a range of responses from CEOs in Silicon Valley, where popular sentiment had tilted strongly against Trump because of his statements on immigrants, women, overseas manufacturing and the use of encryption in consumer products like Apple’s iPhones. In a postelection email to employees, Apple CEO Cook didn’t mention Trump by name but acknowledged that many people had strong feelings about the outcome of the vote. Cook had let it be known during the campaign that he didn’t support Trump, although he generally avoided taking a public stance on the candidates. In his email, Cook said Apple would continue to support diversity. Cook didn’t mention encryption, which he has previously argued is essential to protect consumers’ privacy. But he added, “While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed.” Microsoft’s chief executive was more conciliatory. In a post on LinkedIn, the social networking site that Microsoft is buying, Satya Nadella wrote: “We congratulate the president-elect, and look forward to working with all those elected yesterday.” But Nadella added that Microsoft is committed to “fostering a diverse and inclusive culture.” Facebook’s Zuckerberg, who had previously criticized Trump’s call for building a wall on the Mexican border, sounded subdued in a post on his own social network. “I thought about all the work ahead of us to create the world we want for our children,” he wrote. “This work is bigger than any presidency and progress does not move in a straight line.” The most combative response came from the CEO at Grubhub, an online food delivery service based in Chicago. Matt Maloney said in an email to employees that he rejects Trump’s “nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics,” adding that anyone who disagrees should immediately resign “because you have no place here.” Maloney later backtracked in a tweet that said “Grubhub does not tolerate hate and we are proud of all our employees — even those who voted for Trump.” Other companies have taken the election and its aftermath as a marketing opportunity, most notably airlines. British Airways ran ads on Facebook urging people to visit London, using the tag line “had enough of this house?” under a photo of the White House. Air New Zealand ran ads on Instagram and elsewhere highlighting the results of the election and inviting people to visit New Zealand. Spirit Airlines promoted a 75 percent off sale for flights to Canada. — AP SOURCEAP TAGS Apple Facebook SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleUAE court jails three men for involvement in banned groups Next articleA Trump opportunity in Palestine Ajaz Ali RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Fake Facebook news Google, Facebook move to restrict ads on fake news sites Facebook’s WhatsApp adds secure video calling amid privacy concerns NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply November 2016 S M T W T F S « Oct       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30   STAY CONNECTED 1,489,252FansLike 41,132FollowersFollow Ads Recent Posts SR16b dirty money: 15 under probe Nov 20, 2016 48-hour coalition truce in Yemen takes effect Nov 20, 2016 Traffic disrupted as pedestrian bridge collapses in Jeddah Nov 20, 2016 Some public buildings found violating law on hoisting national flag Nov 20, 2016 Ministry comes to the rescue of abused woman Nov 20, 2016 Archives November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 © Saudi Gazette 2015 All rights reserved.

Please Don't Feed the Gators.

It's true. The reptiles are taking over. Let's take a tour of the place while we still can. Welcome to Trump Swamp. Join us on the glass-bottom boat as we gaze on the denizens below. Keep your hands inside the railings -- and please don't feed the gators. It's hard to get past the white nationalist in any discussion of Trump's team. Sure, they call Steve Bannon's worldview "alt-right," but that's deceptive. That makes it sound like something new, when hatred is as old as the hills. White supremacist Jared Taylor cheered Bannon's hire, saying he suspected Bannon will serve as an "anti-waffler" to maintain Trump's ideological and racial purity. (Taylor's most recent tweet, as of this writing is, "Excellent Boston Globe article about the Hispanic invasion. This is how we throw away our country.") - Advertisement - "I think that's excellent," said former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke of Bannon's hire. "Perhaps The Donald IS for 'REAL,'" the chairman of the American Nazi Party exulted, adding: "Time will tell." Admittedly, when one of the President-elect's appointments gets positive responses from the KKK and the Nazis, it's hard to focus on his other hires. But it's important. If "personnel is policy," as Sen. Elizabeth Warren says, then Trump's policy is plunder. Billionaire Steve Mnuchin is a leading contender for Secretary of the Treasury. As we first noted last August, Mnuchin ran a mortgage-lending outfit called One West, which was investigated for its abusive treatment of borrowers. The California Reinvestment Coalition asked authorities to investigate One West's pattern of racial discrimination in foreclosures, and specifically cited its "foreclosures of widows." Looks like the proprietor of Trump University has found a soul mate. There are others. - Advertisement - Trump also sought out JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon for Treasury Secretary. Dimon has presided over a truly epic orgy of fraud during his tenure. Dimon is a generous campaign donor to politicians from both parties, which may explain why he has escaped serious investigation. (Dimon wisely took his name out of consideration for the job. Elizabeth Warren would have humiliated him.) Then there's billionaire Wilbur Ross, a leading contender for Commerce Secretary. Ross, who is already reassuring investors that Trump won't do anything rash on trade, invests in "distressed assets." What the aliens in "Independence Day" do to planets like Earth, Ross does to troubled companies. He plunders them for anything of value and then leaves them in ruins. And speaking of plundering a planet and leaving it in ruins, here are the leading contenders for Trump's top energy and environmental slots: Next Page  1  |  2   - Advertisement - View Ratings | Rate It http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rj-eskow/the-dumbest-bipartisa Host of 'The Breakdown,' Writer, and Senior Fellow, Campaign for America's Future Go To Commenting The views expressed in this article are the sole responsibility of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of this website or its editors.

(Photo: Mexican Government) Tuesday, November 15, 2016 Analysis Trump & Latin America: What Next? A fearful Latin America hopes Trump’s policies will be different than rhetoric. BY JOACHIM BAMRUD Last week, Mexico's peso experienced its biggest two-day tumble in more than 20 years, while currencies in Brazil and Colombia also fell. Meanwhile, Mexican bonds and stocks had their worst day in five years and Brazil’s Ibovespa fell the most in a month while Colombian stocks also were hit. All because of the results of the November 8, 2016 presidential elections in the United States, which saw Donald Trump as the winner.  Trump has promised to renegotiate or exit the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and impose 35 percent tariffs on imports from Mexico, threatening to cause a potential trade war. He has also vowed to deport millions of illegal immigrants and build a wall between the United States and Mexico. “He will likely intervene less in what Latin Americans consider their own internal affairs, but he also may make decisions that could have broad effects on the region’s economy, such as his desire to avoid the dollar being too strong and wanting to manage interest rates, as well as his criticism and skepticism regarding the [Trans-Pacific Partnership ],” says Frank Holder, Head of Latin America at Berkeley Research Group.  “Finally, his stance on immigration could have a material impact on the region as well.” While it is not yet clear to what degree Trump will implement his campaign promises once he assumes office on January 20, 2017, the uncertainty alone has already put a dent in Latin American capital market activity and caused corporate executives to prepare for changes. Brazil's BM&FBovespa CEO Edemir Pinto, said Monday that market volatility caused by Trump's victory may force some Brazilian companies to delay their share-listing plans, Reuters reports. On Thursday, Mexico's finance ministry said that it would cut the amount of long-term peso bonds it would offer during the rest of the fourth quarter after the outcome of the U.S. presidential election increased market volatility, according to another report from Reuters. Brazil’s well-respected Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles warns that Trump's administration may raise funding costs for emerging countries and hurt economic growth if the U.S. president-elect's policies match his campaign rhetoric. The irony is that the United States is shifting course towards protectionism just as Latin America is rolling back the same policies and countries like Brazil, Argentina and Peru were seeking closer U.S. relations. “The paradox …is that while Trump is betting on restricting free trade, in Latin America presidents like [Argentine Mauricio] Macri, Brazilian Michel Temer and Peruvian Pedro Pablo Kuczynski are leading a wave in favor of open trade and closer ties with the United States that hadn’t been seen in the region for many years,” Spanish newspaper El Pais commented. Fittingly, when Brazil's government on Wednesday congratulated Trump on his victory, it also called on him not to resort to protectionism as the South American nation strives to boost trade to overcome a severe recession, according to Reuters. "Trump's protectionist agenda, as outlined during his presidential campaign, would be highly damaging for Latin America if fully implemented," global consultancy IHS warned today. The TPP would have linked the United States with 11 countries in Asia, South America and the south Pacific, including Mexico, Chile and Peru. Riordan Roett, Director of the Latin American Studies Program at SAIS-Johns Hopkins University, says the TPP is “dead as a door nail.” “Trump and his acolytes and his base believe globalization is the root of all evil and trade agreements are at the base of that evil,” he says. A spokesperson for The International Monetary Fund told Latinvex that it does not plan to revise its latest economic forecasts for 2016 and 2017 until January, but private sector analysts are already revising down GDP estimates for Latin American countries. Meanwhile, several analysts also believe the US economy will be hurt by Trump’s policies. Bank of America Merrill Lynch cut its already lukewarm estimate for U.S. growth in the first six months of 2017 on the belief that trade restrictions adopted by a Trump administration will outweigh an increase in government spending, MarketWatch reported. A slowdown in the US economy would mean a reduction in imports from Latin American goods and services. Although Trump’s infrastructure plans may boost imports of copper from Latin America, as John Price, managing director of Americas Market Intelligence, points out. (See Trump: The New Yankee Threat). And uncertainty around Trump’s policies could also lead to a sustained gold rally, which would benefit gold exporters like Peru, Semana Economica reports. MEXICO: THE BIG LOSER While Latin America as a whole will be impacted by a more protectionist United States, Mexico is clearly the biggest loser. Mexico is the third-largest exporter to the United States after China and Canada and last year exported goods worth $294.7 billion to the US market, a 0.2 percent increase from 2014, according to US Census Bureau data analyzed by Latinvex. “Trump could actually exit NAFTA without needing Congress to do it, but it would be a messy affair,” Holder says.  “It would almost certainly end up in court.  It could also generate a trade war, which would be damaging to US companies as well.  What is most likely is that he will try and modify certain aspects of it without trashing the whole agreement.  For example, the automotive industry might be an area of focus.” US exporters to Mexico would clearly be hurt from retaliation by Mexico’s government. Mexico is the second-largest export market for the United States, only slightly behind Canada. “Canada and Mexico should - will - oppose any unilateral action by Trump," Riordan says. " If [Trump] does impose tariffs, so will they." HSBC and Santander on Monday both cut their growth outlook for Mexico next year on expectations that Trump's rise to the U.S. presidency could hit investment and consumer confidence in Latin America's No.2 economy, Reuters reports. Mexico's top private bank Citibanamex did so last week. Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note that the fallout from a Trump presidency would have "deep ramifications" for the Mexican equity market and that foreign investment could stall. Trump's proposed cancelation or renegotiation of NAFTA and other increased trade protectionism measures pose varying degrees of credit risk to Mexican corporate bond issuers, according a new Fitch Ratings report. "Mexican industrial activity is strongly linked to the U.S. economy given the countries' geographic proximity. Mexico has functioned as a natural industrial hub to the U.S. under the NAFTA framework," Fitch director Jay Djemal said in a statement. "Given this link, protectionist policies, if enacted by U.S. authorities, and FX risk could impact some Mexican corporate credit profiles. However, other companies might benefit from some of the proposed policies such as increased infrastructure spending." America Movil, Axtel, Famsa, Grupo Televisa, ODM, Servicios Corporativos Javer, and TV Azteca all have varying yet significant degrees of exposure to Mexican peso devaluation against the US dollar, Fitch says. Meanwhile, Fibra Terrafina and Fibra Uno are exposed to potential protectionist measures due to their ownership of industrial parks, which serve the needs of many multinational companies and Mexican exporters and Controladora Mabe is at risk of tariffs being levied across its range of white goods due to approximately 30 percent of its exports sold to the United States, Fitch points out. Companies are now preparing to shift manufacturing and supply strategies. Swiss food giant Nestle may adjust its supply chains and export strategies if Trump imposes new taxes on products made south of the border, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Motorcar Parts of America (MPA), is mulling a possible move of its Mexican operations to either California or Malaysia, El Financiero reports. MPA is one of the largest auto part producers in North America. BRAZIL: UNCERTAIN RECOVERY Brazil, Latin America’s largest economy, is also being impacted. The real weakened more than its peers on Monday as traders' concerns over the election of Trump as U.S. president drove investors to seek safer investments ahead of a local holiday, Reuters reported. That followed losses all last week. The “trump Effect” is raising concern among Brazilian officials, Exame reports. Meanwhile stocks have been hit as well. On Friday, the Ibovespa fell the most in a month as investors dumped Brazilian stocks, Bloomberg reported. Brazil's Treasury said on Monday it would cancel an auction to sell LTN and NTN-F bonds scheduled for Wednesday and instead buy NTN-F bonds expiring in 2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027, in response to market volatility, Reuters reports. While Brazil depends much less on trade with the United States, the government is betting on US investments to help the economy recover. It also hopes Brazilian companies – including state oil giant Petrobras – will be able to succeed in capturing needed capital through local and international capital markets. Now both are under threat as uncertainty hits US multinationals and investors alike. ARGENTINA: CAPITAL MARKETS HIT? More than Brazil, Argentina was betting on capital markets to help boost its recovery. After seeing a wave of bonds this year, both policymakers and companies alike were looking forward to an even stronger 2017. The head of JPMorgan Chase & Co in Argentina expects Argentina to see IPOs worth $5 billion next year despite Trump's victory in US elections, mainly from real estate and agro companies, Bloomberg reports. The outlook stands firm as long as a Trump Administration doesn't hike up interest rates.  However, the uncertainty caused local market economists to recommend that the government stop issuing debt for at least 60 days to wait and see how the market reacts to Trump, Cronista reports. The good news is that since reaching an agreement with bondholders earlier this year, Argentina’s government raised $20 billion, enough to cover its financing needs until February. That gives Macri time to ride out the storm, Walter Stoeppelwerth, chief investment officer at Balanz Capital, told Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Trump is also expected to impact US-Cuba relations, which had improved under outgoing President Barack Obama. “He will almost certainly roll back relations,” Holder says.  “He has made it clear he is not opposed to a deal for rapprochement, but he does not agree with the current agreement in place.” WATERED DOWN TRUMP? Policymakers in Latin America are pinning their hopes on that Trump will prove to be more pragmatic and water down many of his campaign pledges, including his threats against NAFTA. Mexico's government is optimistic that Trump will be more appreciative of the benefits of the U.S.-Mexico relationship as president than he was as a candidate, deputy Foreign Minister Paulo Carreno told Bloomberg News. “One thing is training for the game; another is actually playing it,” Brazilian Foreign Minister Jose Serra said. And Argentine economists say Trump may not be able to be as protectionist as he has vowed because free trade still has strong support from the Republican Party, which will control Congress, La Nacion reports. “The Republican Party is staunchly pro-free trade,” Walter Molano, head of research at BCP Securities, wrote in an analysis to clients. “They rely heavily on the patronage and support of traditional multinational corporations. Therefore, they will not be keen on making major modifications to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)….This means that some of the concerns about the future of the Mexican economy and the MXN may be overblown.”  Meanwhile, World Bank senior economist Joost Draaima points out that Mexico is sufficiently strong to withstand the uncertainty around Trump, including international reserves of $176 billion, a credit line with the IMF and solid fiscal and monetary policies, Milenio reports.    IHS says signs of a where Trump will go can be seen in whether or not he picks cabinet members with protectionist backgrounds. However, even if Trump waters down his threats against NAFTA, increased border security will likely hurt US-Mexican trade, according to IHS. “Should border security significantly increase, it could lead to cargo delays for companies reliant upon movement of goods across the border,” it said last week.  © Copyright Latinvex   SEE ALSO US-Mexico Trade: The Numbers Trump: The New Yankee Threat Pained Reflections on a Trump Victory Ex-Ambassadors Warn Against NAFTA Changes Hills: Losing Mexico Market Would Be Devastating Farnsworth: Trump & Latin America  Fact Check: Donald Trump Wrong on Mexico The Cost of a US-Mexico Trade War NAFTA: The Benefits Versus The Costs       Other articles in : Analysis Back to Analysis    Peru to Become More Business-Friendly Latin America Business: Best in 2015 Latin America Business: Worst in 2015  Cuba Embargo: What New Rules Mean Fact Check: Donald Trump Wrong on Mexico Argentina: Avoiding Another Default Argentina and Venezuela: Outlook Worsens Getting Electricity: Brazil Better Than Mexico NAFTA Turns Twenty Cuba: The Last Dictatorship Terrorism Risks Rising in Colombia Panama Canal Expansion Makes History Home Subscription Benefits Testimonials Free Newsletter Site Map Key Conferences About US Press & News Privacy Policy Contact Us Paseo de los periodistas #52.

Nasdaq on Monday announced Friedman, currently president and chief operating officer, would replace long-time CEO Robert Greifeld in January, making her one of the most powerful women on Wall Street. She said regulations following the 2008 financial crisis meant to reduce risk-taking by banks were well intentioned, but that some may have gone too far. She called for a more "balanced approach to regulation." "There are elements of the regulation that we are living with today that have hampered the ability for banks to provide an important role in providing liquidity into the markets," Friedman said at a JPMorgan Chase & Co investor conference. Those rules have not only hurt trading volumes but hindered lending to small- and medium-sized businesses, she said. Trump promised during his campaign to slash taxes and regulation, including the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reforms aimed at curbing risk taking by banks and protecting consumers, which he said makes it hard for banks to loan money. Provisions of Dodd-Frank included the Volcker Rule, which restricts speculative investments by banks, and the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to police areas like mortgage servicing, debt collection and payday lending. Trump adviser Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge-fund industry executive, has said that Dodd-Frank would be reviewed and "the worst anti-business parts of it will be gutted." Mary Jo White, outgoing chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said on Tuesday she would not want to see parts of Dodd-Frank, including the Volcker Rule, rescinded or repealed. The SEC does not have evidence that the rules have affected market liquidity, she said in testimony to the House Financial Services Committee. White said on Monday she planned to depart the SEC around the same time President Barack Obama leaves the White House.

James Gorman, Morgan Stanley’s chief executive, made a $2.9m profit on Friday by exercising share options granted to him at $22.98 and then selling the shares at $37.70. A slew of other executives followed suit. Morgan Stanley shares surged by nearly a fifth – to their highest in more than a year – following Trump’s victory last week. Overall US bank shares are enjoying their sharpest recovery rally since the 2008 to 2009 financial crisis as investors buy up bank stocks hoping that Trump’s promise of tearing up regulation will help banks make bigger profits. Traders also expect Trump’s plans for huge infrastructure investment to raise inflation and the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates, which would also help banks make more money. Rudy Giuliani reportedly favorite to be Trump's secretary of state – politics live Read more The S&P 500 banks index, which tracks the biggest US banks, rose by 10.2% in the three days after Trump’s victory – the best three-day performance since August 2009. In those three days, Wells Fargo shares rose 13.6%, JPMorgan Chase shares rose 9.5% and Bank of America shares climbed 11.9%. Analyst say US banks’ shares could still be a bargain at today’s prices as Trump’s exact stance on regulations such as the Dodd-Frank act become clear. Trump has criticized Obama’s centrepiece 2010 regulatory reform of the banking sector, designed to try and help prevent a fresh financial crisis, as a “very negative force”. Trump’s transition website, greatagain.gov, describes Dodd-Frank as “a sprawling and complex piece of legislation that has unleashed hundreds of new rules and several new bureaucratic agencies” and pledges to repeal it and replace it with “new policies to encourage economic growth and job creation”. A slew of other Morgan Stanley executives also made big profits by buying and selling their share options on Friday, according to regulatory filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Colm Kelleher, the bank’s president, made $3.3m; Dan Simkowtiz, the head of investment management, made $2.3m; and Eric Gross, the chief legal officer, made $475,000. Jonathan Pruzan, the bank’s chief financial officer, sold 44,625 of his share options on 8 November – before the result of the election – for $33.90 a share. He would have made $174,000 more if he had, like his colleagues, waited until Trump was declared the victor. Gorman was paid $21m last year.

The Fed made the promise at the conclusion of an independent, two-year study of how the central bank examines a few dozen of the largest firms on Wall Street. Specifically, the Fed promised to be more open about "the qualitative assessment process (and) detailing its reasons for decisions to object to specific firms' capital plans," the central bank said in a letter to the Government Accountability Office. Banks with more than $50 billion in assets must submit to the Fed review. Among the 33 lenders that must satisfy the Fed each year are firms like JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N>, Goldman Sachs <GS.N> and Wells Fargo & Co <WFC.N>. Rep. Jeb Hensarling, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said the Fed was too opaque and called for major reforms. "The GAO report confirms the secrecy surrounding the stress tests makes it almost impossible to measure the effectiveness of the Fed's regulatory oversight or the integrity of the tests' findings," the Texas Republican said in a statement. Although the GAO findings are non-binding, they could exert some influence on an impending debate about whether financial regulations are unduly costly. President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants to ease federal regulations.

Apple CEO Tim Cook didn't support Donald Trump, but he mostly avoided getting too political during the campaign.  (Richard Drew / The Associated Press)   After the U.S. presidential election, T-Mobile CEO John Legere tweeted out: “let’s see what an out of the box, nontypical, non-politician can do for America!”  (Stephen Brashear / The Associated Press Images for T-Mobile)   By Ken SweetThe Associated Press Tues., Nov. 15, 2016 NEW YORK—Apple CEO Tim Cook is telling his employees to “keep moving forward.” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is saying “progress does not move in a straight line.” T-Mobile’s CEO John Legere tweeted “let’s see what an out of the box, nontypical, non-politician can do for America!” CEOs of major companies are taking stands about the results of the election — a departure from the traditional model of not mixing politics with business that major brands have long espoused. Some are using it as an opportunity to bring their employees together following a divisive election campaign. Others are using it as an opportunity to stress their companies’ values and mission, or an opportunity to make nice with Donald Trump, who many CEOs were publicly against during the campaign. The men and women who head the nation’s biggest companies know that having a hostile relationship with the Trump administration could make doing business difficult. They also know that they operate in liberal bastions like New York and San Francisco just as much as in Trump-leaning places like Fort Wayne, Indiana, or Charleston, West Virginia. “Neutral is the best policy,” says John Challenger, CEO of workplace consultant Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Article Continued Below T-Mobile’s Legere, who had been vocally opposed to Trump, congratulated the president-elect on Twitter for his victory, while holding off on judging the president-elect’s policies. Meanwhile, another telecommunications executive, Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure, himself an immigrant and personally opposed to Trump, sent an email to employees saying that “it’s our obligation to accept the will of our fellow Americans and respect the new leader.” It’s possible that Legere and Claure made nice because the president appoints the chairman and commissioners of the Federal Communications Commission, an agency that holds enormous influence over the telecommunications industry. All five FCC commissioners will see their terms expire during Trump’s first term. CEOs of automakers, including Ford’s Mark Fields, have also struck a conciliatory tone, partly because Trump has called for the repeal or renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which has allowed the automakers to set up shop in Mexico tariff-free. Many CEOs publicly expressed hope that the tensions dividing the country will diminish, and that American consumers will set aside their fears and get back to what they do best: shop. “We are hoping that in the postelection we are just going to see people ready to spend,” said Marvin Ellison, CEO of JCPenney. CEOs and companies that try to bring people together are “going to be the winners,” says Dr. Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University’s Lubin School of Business. “That always works better from a brand perspective,” he says. Wall Street, which donated heavily to Hillary Clinton, also now faces an administration that could provide both profit and peril. Trump has said he wants to roll back some of the regulations in the Dodd-Frank law that was passed after the financial crisis, a move that would benefit big Wall Street banks. But the Republican Party’s platform also contains a provision calling for the return of the Glass-Steagall Act, a Great Depression-era law that broke up big banks. There’s talk of a massive, $1 trillion infrastructure program that could rely on tax credits to private funding sources. Many of those programs will require Wall Street’s army of investment bankers and lawyers to help underwrite and finance. “The president-elect’s commitment to infrastructure spending, government reform and tax reform — among other things — will be good for growth and, therefore, will be good for our clients and for our firm,” said Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, according to a transcript of a voicemail he sent companywide. In an email to his employees, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the election of Trump shows “the frustration that so many people have with the lack of economic opportunity and the challenges they face.” Trump’s victory drew a range of responses from CEOs in Silicon Valley, where popular sentiment had tilted strongly against Trump because of his statements on immigrants, women, overseas manufacturing and the use of encryption in consumer products like Apple’s iPhones. In a postelection email to employees, Apple CEO Cook didn’t mention Trump by name but acknowledged that many people had strong feelings about the outcome of the vote. Cook had let it be known during the campaign that he didn’t support Trump, although he generally avoided taking a public stance on the candidates. In his email, Cook said Apple would continue to support diversity. Cook didn’t mention encryption, which he has previously argued is essential to protect consumers’ privacy. But he added, “While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed.” Microsoft’s chief executive was more conciliatory. In a post on LinkedIn, the social networking site that Microsoft is buying, Satya Nadella wrote: “We congratulate the president-elect, and look forward to working with all those elected yesterday.” But Nadella added that Microsoft is committed to “fostering a diverse and inclusive culture.” Facebook’SEND Zuckerberg, who had previously criticized Trump’s call for building a wall on the Mexican border, sounded subdued in a post on his own social network. “I thought about all the work ahead of us to create the world we want for our children,” he wrote. “This work is bigger than any presidency and progress does not move in a straight line.” The most combative response came from the CEO at Grubhub, an online food delivery service based in Chicago. Matt Maloney said in an email to employees that he rejects Trump’s “nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics,” adding that anyone who disagrees should immediately resign “because you have no place here.” Maloney later backtracked in a tweet that said “Grubhub does not tolerate hate and we are proud of all our employees — even those who voted for Trump.” Other companies have taken the election and its aftermath as a marketing opportunity, most notably airlines. British Airways ran ads on Facebook urging people to visit London, using the tag line “had enough of this house?” under a photo of the White House. Air New Zealand ran ads on Instagram and elsewhere highlighting the results of the election and inviting people to visit New Zealand. Spirit Airlines promoted a 75 per cent off sale for flights to Canada.

U.S. stocks are rising Tuesday as the price of oil soars, sending energy companies higher. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) New York — Asian stock markets were mostly higher Wednesday, tracking overnight gains on Wall Street, as investors awaited more policy details from U.S. president-elect Donald Trump.

Australia's S&P/ASX added 0.1 percent to 5,330.40, while markets in Taiwan, Singapore and Southeast Asia were stronger.

OIL: Oil prices rallied overnight on hopes that OPEC members would agree to lower output when they meet later this month. But they fell back during Asian trading hours. Benchmark U.S. crude fell 15 cents to $45.66 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract closed up $2.49, or 5.7 percent, to $45.81 per barrel on Tuesday.

Kaley Ann Kunkemoeller, 24, of Stuart faces several charges including sale of oxymorphone, sale within 1,000 feet of a school and possession of drugs. She’s being held on $265,000, according to Martin County jail records. Kunkemoeller was smiling after her arrest, but her demeanor became more serious once she learned her bond amount, authorities said. Oxymorphone, known as Opana, is a highly additive opioid. Kunkemoeller was wanted on warrants surrounding the sale of drugs and was found hiding 50 miles south of Stuart in Boynton Beach by U.S. Marshals Fugitive Task Force. She attempted to flee, but was arrested soon after on Friday. Details about the sales were not immediately available. Kunkemoeller was arrested in September for drug possession including the narcotic painkiller buprenorphine and drug paraphernalia, jail records show. That case remains open.

Police said the two were arrested after they were identified as suspects in Friday's shooting death of 15-year-old Javon Wilson. Police said the shooting stemmed from a dispute over basketball shoes. Wilson knew his accused attackers and they may have been friends at some point, police said. Davis said he was told that a 15-year-old boy had traded slacks for shoes with Wilson's 14-year-old brother, but thought better of the trade and went to Wilson's house with a 17-year-old girl. He said the pair forced their way in the house and argued with Wilson before the boy shot Wilson in the head. Davis told WMAQ that two of Wilson's brothers, ages 14 and 8, a 16-year-old sister and an uncle were all in the home at the time of the shooting, while his mother had left the house to get some food. "Here he was in the house, in his home, minding his own business and some intruders would come and snuff his life away," Davis told WMAQ. Davis, a Democratic member of the House for 20 years, told the AP on Saturday that his grandson was a victim of a world where gun violence has become commonplace. "It's almost, just the way it is. People think nothing of it," Davis told the AP. “Youngsters invariably say, ‘I know a lot of guys who've got guns. I know a lot of girls who've got guns.’ "It becomes a part of the culture of an environment that has got to change." Trump considers retired Gen. Mattis for secretary of defense Updated: Sunday, November 20, 2016 @ 11:03 AM Published: Sunday, November 20, 2016 @ 10:01 AM By: Bob D'Angelo - Cox Media Group National Content Desk Calling him a “true general’s general,” President-elect Donald Trump said Sunday he was considering retired Marine Gen. James Mattis as his secretary of defense, CNN reported >> Read more trending stories The two men met for a little over an hour Saturday afternoon in Bedminster, New Jersey. An official familiar with the transition process told CNN that it was  an important meeting and that Mattis can be considered a leading candidate. While Trump has not made an official announcement, he did tell reporters that the retired four-star general “is the real deal” and noted on Twitter that Mattis was a "true general's general." Mattis, nicknamed “Mad Dog,” served 44 years in the Marine Corps. He led a task force into southern Afghanistan in 2001 and a Marine division during the Iraq invasion in 2003. He retired in 2013. He was praised for his leadership during the 2004 Battle of Falluja in Iraq, but was embroiled in controversy the following year when he said, “It’s fun to shoot some people,” while addressing service members in San Diego.

The Atlanta City Council approved a resolution on Nov. 7 calling for the placement of an historical marker on the grounds of  City Hall honoring Vietnam veterans. “More than 40 years ago we did not greet these brave soldiers when they came home. Some of them had to take their uniforms off, for fear of retaliation from their fellow Americans who were opposed to the war,” said Councilmember Michael Julian Bond. “It is only befitting that we commemorate the courage, devotion to duty, and sacrifice our Vietnam veterans have made in the fight for peace and democracy.” Atlanta Public Schools (APS) and Junior Achievement (JA) of Georgia have announced an expansion of their partnership to include JA Academy, which will enroll its first class of 150 APS students at B.E.S.T. Academy High School at Benjamin S. Carson on the Westside beginning August 2017. Enrollment is open to all rising ninth and tenth grade students, who reside within the APS attendance zones, and the school will continue to grow as students matriculate to the next grade level.  JA Academy is designed to provide four years of rigorous standards-based education that integrates business connectivity directly into the education process. The framework creates an interdisciplinary learning environment that engages students through dynamic real-life case studies, which provide exposure to a myriad of industries and careers, and creates purposeful connections between academic concepts and real-world application. The curriculum also gives students hands-on experience through work based learning, collaboration with mentors, and engagement with post-secondary institutions. For more information on JA Academy, visit georgia.ja.org/jaacademy.

Meanwhile another telecommunications executive, Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure, himself an immigrant and personally opposed to Trump, sent an email to employees saying that “it’s our obligation to accept the will of our fellow Americans and respect the new leader.” It’s possible that Legere and Claure made nice because the president appoints the chairman and commissioners of the Federal Communications Commission, an agency that holds enormous influence over the telecommunications industry.

In an email to his employees, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the election of Trump shows “the frustration that so many people have with the lack of economic opportunity and the challenges they face.” Trump’s victory drew a range of responses from CEOs in Silicon Valley, where popular sentiment had tilted strongly against Trump because of his statements on immigrants, women, overseas manufacturing and the use of encryption in consumer products like Apple’s iPhones. In a postelection email to employees, Apple CEO Cook didn’t mention Trump by name but acknowledged that many people had strong feelings about the outcome of the vote. Cook had let it be known during the campaign that he didn’t support Trump, although he generally avoided taking a public stance on the candidates. In his email, Cook said Apple would continue to support diversity. Cook didn’t mention encryption, which he has previously argued is essential to protect consumers’ privacy. But he added, “While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed.” Microsoft’s chief executive was more conciliatory. In a post on LinkedIn, the social networking site that Microsoft is buying, Satya Nadella wrote: “We congratulate the president-elect, and look forward to working with all those elected yesterday.” But Nadella added that Microsoft is committed to “fostering a diverse and inclusive culture.” Advertisement Continue reading Facebook’s Zuckerberg, who had previously criticized Trump’s call for building a wall on the Mexican border, sounded subdued in a post on his own social network. “I thought about all the work ahead of us to create the world we want for our children,” he wrote. “This work is bigger than any presidency and progress does not move in a straight line.” The most combative response came from the CEO at Grubhub, an online food delivery service based in Chicago. Matt Maloney said in an email to employees that he rejects Trump’s “nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics,” adding that anyone who disagrees should immediately resign “because you have no place here.” Maloney later backtracked in a tweet that said “Grubhub does not tolerate hate and we are proud of all our employees — even those who voted for Trump.” Other companies have taken the election and its aftermath as a marketing opportunity, most notably airlines. British Airways ran ads on Facebook urging people to visit London, using the tag line “had enough of this house?” under a photo of the White House. Air New Zealand ran ads on Instagram and elsewhere highlighting the results of the election and inviting people to visit New Zealand. Spirit Airlines promoted a 75 percent off sale for flights to Canada. ___ AP Technology Writer Brandon Bailey contributed to this report from San Francisco.
