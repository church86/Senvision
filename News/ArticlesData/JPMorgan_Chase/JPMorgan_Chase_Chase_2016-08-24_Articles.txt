(NYSE: MCK) with other health stock declines despite an upgrade to L-3 Communications (NYSE: LLL) by JPMorgan and gains by other defense primes and government services providers. GovCon Index gainers outnumbered laggers by roughly 2-to-1 ratio and eight of the GCI’s 11 S&P 500-listed companies advanced with L-3 the top net gainer and McKesson the largest net and percentage lagger for stocks included in both indices. Pharmaceutical supply services company McKesson had 2.37 million shares traded to nearly double the three-month average volume as the S&P sector fell more than 1 percent on continued controversy over Mylan’s move to raise the price of its Epipen allergy medication. L-3 is now JPMorgan’s new top pick in the defense sector as the firm lifted the New York City-based defense contractor to “Overweight” from “Neutral” with a higher price target of $182 from $158 in a research note to investors. JPMorgan analyst Seth Seifman told investors he expects L-3 to generate 5-percent compound annual growth in free cash flow through 2020 to become the second-highest level of defense stocks covered by the financial services firm. L-3 should also see 2-percent annual organic growth and achieve at least one additional percentage point of margin through 2018, Seifman said. Seifman also downgraded Northrop Grumman‘s (NYSE: NOC) stock from “Overweight” to “Neutral” on cash return yield he believes as no longer exceptional but also raised the price target from $225 to $231. Seifman remains upbeat on defense and expects the average defense stock to gain 10 percent over the next 16 months as that sector is attractive to investors with companies that have “robust, visible cash flows and… commitment to returning that cash.” ManTech International (Nasdaq: MANT) and Science Applications International Corp. (NYSE: SAIC) hit 52-week highs during intraday trade Thursday. The S&P 500 has closed at a gain or loss of less than 1 percent for 33 straight days with Thursday the final trading day before Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen speaks Friday morning in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

Only about a quarter of quantitative equity funds have beaten their benchmarks since June, reversing a trend from the first half of 2016, research from JPMorgan Chase & Co. showed yesterday. One reason for the skid: managers chasing momentum shares paid a price when a lot of them got caught in the downdraft that befell low-volatility equities starting in June. While it’s a distinction that sounds like it could only matter to data scientists, the issue is potentially a lesson for the millions of investors who have fallen in love with smart-beta ETFs in the last few years. Portfolios advertised as a way of owning one group of equities can sometimes be overrun by stocks with very different characteristics. “Your average quant is particularity enamored with momentum,” said Abhra Banerji, the director of quantitative research at Evercore ISI. “The guys who are momentum chasers have a good track record, but they’re struggling because of their investment in low vol.” Factor investing forms the wiring of smart-beta ETFs, and is also a tool of computer-aided traders looking to diversify or make broader market wagers. Similar to smart-beta, which group stocks into indexes based on characteristics such as high dividends or low valuations, quant strategies based on factors might dictate owning companies with common earnings, price or valuation traits, as a way of anticipating market conditions. According to JPMorgan, automated traders ran into trouble in the third quarter by doing what they often do -- loading up on stocks with the highest price momentum. Turns out, because investors spent the first six months of the year bidding up defensive industries like utilities, many stocks in that group also happened to fall into another factor category, low volatility. When the market turned against low-vol stocks at the start of the quarter, funds holding momentum got burned. “This unwind of low vol likely explains the recent underperformance of quant funds, while the rotation into value has helped fundamental investors regain some lost ground,” Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, head of equity strategy and global quant research at JPMorgan, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. “Quant funds fared better in the first half as their performance is more closely tied to low-vol stocks.” How much these descriptions matter depends on whom you’re talking to -- one person’s “ style infection” is just faulty stock picking to someone else. Even so, assembling stocks according to shared style characteristics has been a goldmine for ETF providers. Particularly for people trying to duck in and out of factor ETFs, knowing that your low-volatility portfolio contains a bunch of momentum shares could be useful. “If you have an inflection point, price momentum unwinding takes place much more quickly than it does in any other factor, and that’s why it should be relevant to the folks that are investing in low vol,” said Banerji. “If the momentum exposure is increasing your risk of a downside move, that defeats the purpose of holding a low-vol ETF.” Start your day with what’s moving markets.

A market-neutral strategy that bets on the highest-momentum companies while wagering against the lowest lost 2 percent since the start of July, according to a Bloomberg PORT U.S. equity model drawn from about 2,000 stocks. The momentum trade is on pace for a quarter equally as grim as the one that kicked off 2016, when the strategy saw it’s worst three months since 2009. Likewise, the PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF has fallen more than 1.5 percent since the end of July, on track for its worst quarterly stretch since the aftermath of the August correction. Flows have also begun to weaken. Since the the start of August, BlackRock Inc.’s minimum variance product has seen more than $333 million in outflows, the most ever for a period of that length. The worst may not be over yet for low-volatility funds, according to Julian Emanuel, executive director of U.S. equity and derivatives strategy at UBS Securities LLC. Valuations for sectors with low-vol characteristics are still stretched and due for a correction should a catalyst appear, such as in increase in interest rates, he said. In a search for safe yield, sectors less susceptible to fluctuations in the economy like utilities have a price-to-earnings ratio that sits 22 percent above its 10-year average. “They haven’t suffered any of the potential dangers because they’re still hovering near their highs,” Emanuel said by phone. “By definition, if it’s momentum it’s working and you tend not to suffer draw-downs along the way until the momentum reversal finally occurs. This has been a slow-motion train wreck which could become a fast motion train wreck.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Aug 24, 2016 at 6:20PM Image source: Wikimedia Commons. Most people who follow bank stocks probably know JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is a big bank. It is, after all, reputed to be the nation's largest. But even people who are familiar with JPMorgan Chase may be surprised at how much larger it is if you measure its size in a slightly different way. When analysts talk about the size of a bank, they're generally referring to its balance sheet and, more specifically, to the combined value of its assets, which tend to consist of loans and government securities. JPMorgan Chase has $2.5 trillion worth of assets. Roughly a third of those are loans, a third are securities, and the final third is split between cash and other types of assets. Data source: Quarterly regulatory filings. Slideshow by author. The size of a bank's balance sheet is unquestionably important. This follows from the fact that one of the main ways a bank makes money is to arbitrage interest rates -- that is, to borrow money at low short-term rates from depositors and wholesale lenders, and then invest the funds into assets that earn higher longer-term rates, such as loans and securities. The more a bank can leverage its capital in this way, the more money it makes. Last year, for example, JPMorgan Chase generated $44 billion worth of so-called net interest income. That equated to just under half of its net revenue. But even though measuring a bank's size based on the value of the assets on its balance sheet is the most common way to do so, there are other things investors should factor into the equation. There's one metric in particular that shows just how much a bank's balance sheet underestimates its economic footprint. I'm talking about assets under management or custody. The former are assets held for individuals in, say, an investment fund that's actively managed by JPMorgan Chase. Assets under custody, by contrast, refers to assets the bank administers for institutional investors. The important thing to note, here, is that neither of these types of assets is reflected on JPMorgan's balance sheet. Additionally, while assets under custody or management don't generate the same bang for the buck that on-balance-sheet assets do, since the majority of income therefrom goes to the assets' legal owners, assets under management or custody do play into a bank's profits by way of noninterest income. To this end, in JPMorgan Chase's latest quarter, nearly a quarter of its fee-based revenue, or $1.1 billion, from its corporate and investment bank came from activities associated with asset management, administration, and commissions. On top of this, the quantity of assets under management or custody also factors into the amount of capital a bank must hold. In short, a bank that exercises authority over a sizable amount of off-balance-sheet assets like these face slightly higher capital requirements. So, just how much bigger is JPMorgan Chase if we include these? It's roughly 10 times bigger than its balance sheet lets on. As of its latest quarter, it reported nearly $21 trillion worth of assets under custody and management. Add that to the $2.5 trillion on its balance sheet and you're looking at a bank that controls assets valued at just under $25 trillion. John Maxfield has no position in any stocks mentioned.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Business Insider Aug 24th 2016 9:46AM Wall Street jobs and internships are extremely tough to score, and JPMorgan is no exception. That firm receives tens of thousands of applications for internships every year. So if you're one of those people, you definitely want to avoid making any big, obvious mistakes. JPMorgan's head of firmwide campus recruiting, Michelle Bucaria, has seen it all. She's held multiple human-resources positions at JPMorgan, and worked on the front lines of campus recruiting early on in her career in the 1990s. Bucaria told us about some of the most common mistakes that she and her recruiters encounter. Take notes. No typos on the résumé! "Read it," Bucaria said. Seriously, you'd think this would be a given. But according to Bucaria, "It's reasonably common — more than you think." The last thing you want to do in investment banking is look sloppy. Don't be too narrow with your "objective" on the résuméReuters It's not a bad idea to clearly state your objective at the top of your résumé. But you need to be really careful about it. You don't want to inadvertently state an objective that doesn't describe the program you're applying to. The most common mistake here is that students will say they want to work "in investment banking." That indicates to recruiters that they have no interest in the finance program, the commercial bank, or any other program except for the investment-banking division. But in reality, that's often not the case! "That can dismiss you when you didn't even mean to be dismissed," Bucaria said. Don't forget to speak to recruiters before the résumé dropGetty Most investment banks hold events and presentations on campuses long before it's time for students to actually submit applications. The idea is for students to ask lots of questions about the firms, get to know some recruiters, and schedule some informational interviews. But if you go to an event and just listen, Bucaria said, "Nobody's walked away with any other different impression of you than when you came in." She said a big part of the evaluation comes before résumés are even submitted, when students are at events or interacting with the company and doing informational interviews. "Make sure you're asking questions — be inquisitive," she said. (But also beware of overtalking at campus events — nobody likes an attention hog.) Save yourself some embarrassment at the interview stage by not overstating anything on your résuméReuters At the interview stage, Bucaria said, one common issue she encounters is a breakdown in communication where students aren't able to concisely articulate the contributions that they've made. You need to walk to the line between being too arrogant and too humble. But what's worse is when students aren't able to really talk about something on their résumé because it was totally overstated in the first place. "Sometimes it becomes apparent that something on the résumé seems a little bit better than what you hear in the actual story," Bucaria said. "And somebody might fall down there." Don't forget to read up before your interview so that you can wow them with great questions The questions you ask in your interviews will indicate how much you've prepared. "You can't just come in and ask, 'Tell me about investment banking,'" Bucaria said. "You have to demonstrate that you've done a decent amount of your own research and have thoughtful questions that you want to get answers to." Some examples might be: • "I was reading in the news about JPMorgan's Investor Day, and I saw that Daniel Pinto talked about X. I didn't understand all of the nuances of it, what are the implications for the division I'm applying to?" • "I understand that this is a rotational program. I read the description but it wasn't clear to me if I would actually have the opportunity to rotate through the consumer side of the bank too?" • "What are the opportunities for mobility? I know JPMorgan is great for mobility — they've got opportunities all over the world — how does that actually play out within the corporate-analyst-development program that I'm looking at?"

A gauge of the dollar held a three-day advance after futures traders priced in an increased probability of a rate increase by December. The Fed chief is slated to speak Friday at the annual monetary-policy symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The next Fed policy decision will be announced Sept. 21.

That has created “an easy squeeze situation for the most crowded positions -- like short pound,” he said, referring to the possibility that traders who bet on the U.K. currency falling versus the dollar may have to rush to end those short positions should Yellen’s remarks push the greenback higher. The JPMorgan Chase & Co. gauge of currency price swings was at 10.22 as of 7:11 a.m. in New York, matching the highest since July 26 on a closing-market basis. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the currency against 10 peers, held a three-day, 0.7 percent gain. The U.S. currency strengthened 0.3 percent to $1.1276 per euro and was little changed at 100.25 yen. The probability of a U.S. rate increase next month rose to 28 percent from 24 percent at the start of this week, and the chances by the end of the year grew to 54 percent from 51 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from fed fund futures. “Yellen has to take a clear hawkish stance to justify sustained dollar strength beyond this weekend,” said Nizam Idris, head of foreign-exchange and fixed-income strategy at Macquarie Bank Ltd. in Singapore. “While we expect the dollar to rebound in coming days, as recently built short-dollar positions are likely to be squared off ahead of the symposium, the currency could weaken again on even a subtle shift in Yellen’s views.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The Real Deal Los Angeles The Real Deal Los Angeles Login / Register Magazine New York Miami Advertising Contact Us About Us Edward Minskoff on why his big bet on Playa Vista will pay off NYC developer said he sees expiration of Fox lease as his biggest asset August 22, 2016 11:30AM By Katherine Clarke « Previous Next » Print Edward Minskoff and the Bluffs at Playa Vista New York developer Edward Minskoff recently went into contract to buy the Bluffs at Playa Vista creative office campus from JPMorgan for an undisclosed price rumored to be in the ballpark of $400 million. The deal for the buildings, at 12121 and 12181 Bluff Creek Drive, is expected to close in October. Local industry insiders have described the deal as somewhat risky, since the 500,000-square foot complex is occupied by a single tenant, Fox Interactive Media, whose lease expires in 2021. The departure of the company could leave Minskoff with a lot of empty space to fill. The property is not far from the the “Spruce Goose” hangar, where tech giant Google recently leased space for its L.A. offices. The Real Deal sat down with the developer, whose firm owns and manages almost six million square feet of office, retail and residential space nationwide, to talk about the risk associated with the property and whether he plans to court Google as a prospective tenant.  Why did you like this deal? We’re very excited about the asset, since they’re first class, A-quality office buildings in one of the hottest markets in California right now. You have Google that’s committed to retrofit the Spruce Goose building with over half a million square feet of brand new office space and that’s about 50 feet from our front door. They also have a parcel of land just as close that they have fully entitled for almost 900,000 square feet. They’re making a huge commitment to this part of Southern California. So, you’re hoping there’s going to be a spillover effect? We just think that when our lease with Fox expires in 2021, there won’t be any A quality space left in the vicinity to compete with. Are you thinking Google might be a potential tenant for you? We’re not counting on that but you never know with them. Their growth is so intense. Look what they’ve done in New York — they have over 2 million square feet. It’s been a magnet for other companies in the tech industry to be close by. Our building could be part of their campus or they could ignore it and it won’t be part of their campus. What are you paying, exactly? We won’t disclose those financials. People were saying that the expiration of the Fox lease was a potential risk, but you seem to see it more as an opportunity… I look at it as a big asset for us because Fox doesn’t have any options to renew. Instead of having to wait 12 or 18 months prior to the expiration to find out whether they’ll renew, we can start marketing the space the day after we close. We have five years to market the space. Is there a lot of upside to be had in terms of rents? Yes. The rents have been increasing almost annually in that area. I don’t have a crystal ball to predict what they’ll be, but I foresee rents increasing in the next five years to levels equivalent to what they’re getting in Santa Monica, which is about $6.50 a square foot on a monthly basis. Are you planning to invest more money into upgrading the complex? We’re going to be making some interesting upgrades, mainly to do with landscaping, the lobby and adding a lot of art work. We have a very exciting plan to work with two different artists to do something uplifting. We’re going through all the budgeting of those upgrades right now. Who are the artists? I don’t know if I should say. We have two committed that want to do it. Are they big names? Oh yeah, absolutely. How are you financing the purchase? Conventional financing plus equity. This isn’t your first foray into the L.A. market…. When I was CEO of Olympia & York, I built 400 South Hope in Downtown and then I built 11601 Wilshire, which is a 550,000 square foot office building. They were done in the 1980s. Why did you wait so long to return? I grew up in Southern California so it’s like a second home. We’ve been looking for a long time and are continuing to look. We’ll potentially be developing as well.

The largest banks in the US have all suffered leaks in the recent past, according to the financial services breach report 2006 to 2016 by security firm Bitglass. In the first half of 2016 alone, five of the top 20 banks in the US disclosed breaches, as did 32 other US banks. With lost and stolen devices accounting for 25.3% of data breaches in the sector, the report said financial services organisations seem to struggle with data protection on managed and unmanaged devices. While hacking accounted for a disproportionate number of individuals affected by financial services breaches, only one in five leaks were caused by hacking. Other breaches were the result of unintended disclosures, malicious insiders, and lost paper records. “Financial institutions are prime targets for hackers and are rightfully concerned about the threat of cyber attacks, device theft, and malicious insiders,” said Nat Kausik, CEO of Bitglass. “To stay one step ahead as data moves beyond the firewall, firms in this sector must encrypt cloud data at rest, control access by contextual risk, and protect data on unmanaged devices,” he said. Read more about data breaches Mossack Fonseca breach underlines need to focus cyber security on key data, say experts, after law firm’s founder insists the company was breached by an outside hacker. Drawing on insights from more than 400 senior business executives, research from Experian reveals many businesses are ill-prepared for data breaches. The rise in high-profile security breaches has led to an increasingly worried UK public, calling for 24-hour monitoring of sensitive information. Considering that a data breach could happen to any company at any time, a plan of action is the best tactic. The report highlighted that the largest US bank, JPMorgan Chase, has suffered recurring breaches since 2007. The largest breach at JPMorgan Chase, the result of a cyber attack, was widely publicised in 2014 and affected an estimated 76 million US households. Other breaches at JPMorgan were due to lost devices, unintended disclosures, and payment card fraud. Of the three major credit bureaus, the 2015 Experian leak was the largest, affecting 15 million people. Equifax has also disclosed several recent breaches, including unauthorised accesses earlier this year that affected hundreds of thousands of people. The requirement for financial services businesses to maintain real-time connection to the global economy impairs security precautions, and the increased adoption of cyber insurance are waylaying security efforts,  according to a 2015 report. This is despite the banking industry being one of the most popular targets of cyber criminals, according to the 2015 Financial Services Drill-Down Report from security firm Websense, now known as Forcepoint.   CW+ Features Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join.

By the end of July, EMB saw its assets under management (AUM) balloon to $9.7 billion. 45% of those assets — $4.35 billion — entered the fund as net inflows in 2016 alone. EMB was also the fifth most popular exchange traded fund in the month of July based on creations, which is the mechanism that allows ETFs to track their underlying indexes or constituents. According to ETF.com, EMB has also cracked the top ten year-to-date ETFs in terms of creations as well. With a yield of nearly 5.5%, it’s easy to see why investors are flocking to this fund. That’s nearly triple the yield of the SPY, and more than double the yield of the TLT. Plus, EMB is far less volatile than equity instruments. Taking a look under the hood, EMB actually offers debt exposure to over 30 different countries. Its biggest holdings include sovereign debt from Russia, The Philippines, and Turkey. Each of these countries’ bonds make up with 5% of the fund’s holdings. Bonds from Argentina, Colombia, Hungary, Indonesia, and Poland contribute 4% each. Look for emerging market bond funds to continue to see big attention from investors throughout the rest of the year, with market expectations for a Fed rate hike so low. EMB closed at $117.27 on Wednesday, down $0.40 (-0.34%). The largest bond fund targeting emerging market government debt has risen nearly 11% year-to-date.

The popularity of richly valued low-volatility stocks has begun to fizzle – bad news for quantitative funds that latched onto them for their momentum characteristics following the Brexit vote. STRATEGY The quiet rotation out of low-volatility stocks Add to ... DANI BURGER NEW YORK — Bloomberg News Published Wednesday, Aug. 24, 2016 7:57PM EDT Last updated Wednesday, Aug. 24, 2016 7:57PM EDT Comments AA The computers seem confused. After trouncing their human counterparts in the first half of the year, equity managers who rely on automated processes are having a rough third quarter. The proportion of quantitative funds whose return exceeds their benchmark has dropped to 28 per cent since July, data from JPMorgan Chase & Co. show. Compare that to fundamental equity managers, where 52 per cent are outperforming. Stock pickers are exacting revenge because of a rotation below the surface of one the quietest share markets since before the tech bubble. The popularity of richly valued low-volatility stocks has begun to fizzle – bad news for quantitative funds that latched onto them for their momentum characteristics following the Brexit vote. Now, value stocks are showing signs of regaining favour. “This unwind of low vol likely explains the recent underperformance of quant funds, while the rotation into value has helped fundamental investors regain some lost ground,” Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, head of equity strategy and global quant research at JPMorgan, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. “Quant funds fared better in the first half as their performance is more closely tied to low-vol stocks.” U.S. stocks were little changed on Wednesday, circling in a holding pattern as investors awaited Friday’s speech from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen for clues on when to expect higher borrowing costs. The S&P 500 index slipped after briefly climbing yesterday above its Aug. 15 record close. The gauge has gone 32 days without a 1 per cent move in either direction, the longest since 2014. It’s been a difficult year for active mutual funds, faced with nearly $110-billion (U.S.) of outflows as investors poured $35-billion into passive vehicles. Only 34 per cent beat their benchmark in the second quarter, according to JPMorgan data. Quantitative strategies fared better, with roughly half outperforming, after their programs benefited from a rally in energy shares following the February low. Now the edge is shifting back to the humans. Low-volatility ETFs were among the biggest beneficiaries of passive flows this year. The iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility USA ETF and the PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility fund reached $20-billion in total combined assets for the first time in May. Investor interest in defensive industries pushed valuations to records and turned many low-vol companies into momentum stocks, a favourite among the trend-following quant strategies. But since the the start of August, BlackRock’s minimum variance product has seen more than $333-million in outflows, those most ever for that period of time. Investors added $200-billion to the Vanguard Value ETF over the same period. “What we have seen over the last couple of months is that the more defensive sectors such as consumer staples and utilities have started to underperform because they are so overvalued,” Julian Emanuel, executive director of U.S. equity and derivatives strategy at UBS, said in an interview. “This is a more uncertain world, and we think volatility will revert once again.” Quants had been the only hedge fund category to actually add to stock holdings in the first half of 2016, a move that paid off as the S&P 500 crept within striking distance of all-time highs. But computer-driven investors have been unloading shares since the Federal Reserve’s June meeting, according Mark Connors, Credit Suisse Group AG’s global head of risk advisory. “Quant funds had a very large footprint in gross exposure in 2016 versus long-short funds, which were contracting,” Mr. Connors said by phone. “Gross exposure is almost flat on the year now for quant funds. They don’t do that when their strategies are working.” Hawkish remarks from Fed officials last week, lacklustre data and lofty stock prices combined to curb the rally that drove the S&P 500 to fresh records this month amid better-than-estimated earnings. The index rose almost 20 per cent since reaching a 22-month low in February and trades near its highest valuation in more than decade, based on estimated income. With earnings season now all but complete, equities have barely budged in the past two weeks. The S&P 500 has weaved near the 2,180 level, while the CBOE Volatility index is close to a two-year low. At a mean level around 12 this month, the measure of market turbulence known as the VIX is the lowest for any August since 1994, and has been below 15 for 35 days, the longest stretch of calm since July 2014.

IBM Exec Headed to JPM to Oversee Cloud Development By Robert Barba August 24, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Related Citi Recruits JPM's Gavin Michael to Lead Consumer Technology How B of A's Billion-Dollar Tech Cuts Could Fuel Startups IBM Touts Security of Blockchain Cloud Service How Mobile Banking Is Raising Its Game Customer Experience Is the Tie that Binds Banks and Fintech 'More Sophisticated': Evolution of the Bank-Fintech Dialogue JPMorgan Chase has recruited an IBM executive to oversee its adoption of cloud services. Harish Grama will join the firm next week as its chief information officer for cloud services, according to an internal memo from Dana Deasy, global chief information officer, that was obtained by American Banker. The new hire was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Grama will oversee relationships with external cloud providers and will chair the cloud steering committee, according to the memo. He will also develop a strategy to retrain JPMorgan developers to create cloud-native applications. Grama spent the last 20 years at IBM in various software development roles. He was most recently head of software development for IBM's cloud unit, according to the memo. "Harish has extensive experience in leading large globally distributed organizations in cloud native offerings," the memo said. "Additionally, he was a key leader in driving the transformation of IBM's developer workforce." JPMorgan is pursuing a "hybrid cloud model," which means it is looking to use both public and private clouds. The company has dubbed its private cloud Gaia. The use of cloud technology is appealing to banks because it promises greater efficiencies and should make it easier for the bank to adopt newer technology. However, security risks are the downside.

They're bullish. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Aug 24, 2016 at 11:20AM Wells Fargo has never failed a physical. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. Analysts are bullish on Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) stock, but they don't think its share price has as much upside as its peers. Most of the 36 analysts surveyed by Yahoo! Finance who track Wells Fargo rate the bank either a buy or a strong buy. And while a third of them rate it a hold, none of them are encouraging clients to sell their stakes in the nation's third-biggest bank by assets. Taken together, Wells Fargo earns a recommendation rating of 2.4, which is in the vicinity of a buy. The scale goes from 1.0 for strong buy, up to 5.0 for strong sell. A rating of 3.0 is a hold recommendation, while a 2.0 is the standard buy recommendation. Bank Recommendation Rating Bank of America 1.9 Citigroup 2.0 JPMorgan Chase 2.1 Wells Fargo 2.4 Morgan Stanley 2.4 Goldman Sachs 2.4 Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Wells Fargo ranks near the bottom of the list compared to the nation's five other megabanks, but this has less to do with its future prospects than it does with its current valuation. In that vein, it's no coincidence Bank of America and Citigroup have the highest ratings, and trade at the largest discounts to book value. This also helps to explain why analysts see less short-term upside in Wells Fargo than they do in Bank of America and Citigroup. The consensus price target on Wells Fargo stock is $53, which is about 9% higher than where it trades today. By comparison, as you can see in the table below, analysts are forecasting double-digit upsides for B of A and Citi. Bank Current Price Consensus Price Target Consensus Upside Citigroup $46.49 $54.19 16.6% Bank of America $15.23 $17.28 13.5% Wells Fargo $48.62 $53.00 9% Goldman Sachs $166.76 $181.21 8.7% JPMorgan Chase $65.88 $69.84 6% Morgan Stanley $30.69 $32.37 5.5% Data source: Yahoo! Finance. It's worth noting, too, that Wells Fargo has suffered a handful of analyst downgrades. Most recently, Raymond James downgraded it from an outperform to a market perform. But because these downgrades struck industrywide, it's fair to say that they were triggered primarily by the broader economy, not by concerns specifically about Wells Fargo. And, to be clear, this isn't the most hospitable environment for banks. In addition to the fact that economic concerns about China and Europe are suppressing loan demand, low interest rates here in the United States are constraining lending margins as well. This weighs on banks' profitability. Making matters worse for the institutions are post-financial-crisis regulations that have increased their operating costs. Even after factoring in these concerns, however, analysts are still broadly bullish on banks. While they see more short-term upside in undervalued stocks like Bank of America and Citigroup, they're optimistic about Wells Fargo's prospects too.

Ogawa, a former hedge fund manager at Evolution Japan, will report to Chiyo Aoshima, head of equity sales at JPMorgan Securities Japan Co., and corporate access and client relationship management in Asia, the brokerage said in an e-mailed statement to Bloomberg News. JPMorgan is seeking to boost its Japan stock business, and Ogawa is at least the fourth senior recruit by the U.S. bank for the operation in the past year. Last week, it hired Ryota Sakagami from SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. as its chief Japan equity strategist. The Japanese brokerage unit posted a 23.5 billion yen ($234 million) profit for the year ended March 31, the biggest in at least seven years, according to a disclosure which became available on Aug. 1. Ogawa worked for Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan before joining Evolution Japan, according to the statement. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Oil climbed. The dissonance of reports showing a surge in American new home sales and a slowdown in manufacturing brought into question the hawkish tone of recent comments from Fed officials, keeping the relative sense of calm across asset classes. The S&P 500 Index briefly topped its record closing high, while Treasury 10-year notes were stuck in the tightest monthly trading range since 2006. Oil rallied on speculation that Iran may be more willing to cooperate with other producers seeking to freeze output. Market sentiment has seesawed in recent weeks as traders look for clues on how aggressive the Fed will be in its approach to tightening, while awaiting a speech from Chair Janet Yellen on Friday. The set of mixed economic data is dimming the outlook for the US to diverge from increased monetary stimulus in Europe and Asia. There’s a 26 per cent chance of a rate hike in September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg based on fed fund futures. “We’re crawling toward another high, and it’s all about being in this sweet spot where everything is working well, but not overheating,” said Larry Peruzzi, managing director of international equities at Mischler Financial Group Inc. in Boston. “Now everybody’s looking to Yellen’s testimony on Friday.” The Bank of America Merrill Lynch GFSI Market Risk Index, a measure of future price swings implied by options trading on global equities, interest rates, currencies and commodities, is close to the lowest level of 2016. US stock volatility hovered near a two-year low, while a similar gauge for Treasuries has tumbled from its June peak. Earlier this month, a JPMorgan Chase & Co. index tracking three-month currency swings fell to its lowest since late 2015. Stocks American equities showed signs of breaking out of a torpor, with Monsanto Co. leading a rally in raw-material shares as it’s said to be closer to a merger with Bayer AG. Chipmakers boosted the technology group, and Best Buy Co. surged 20 per cent after surprising earnings. The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent at 4 p.m. in New York. The benchmark gauge has been moving within narrow ranges as investors assess valuations near the highest levels in more than a decade and signals from policy makers, while the earnings season winds down. “We’re in the most aggressive dip-buying market I’ve ever seen,” said Brian Frank, a portfolio manager at Key Biscayne, Florida-based Frank Capital Partners LLC. “I wouldn’t even call the last two days a dip, but any little tiny decline seems to be an excuse to buy and talk about the Fed.” European shares rose the most in two weeks as commodity producers rebounded on higher metals prices, and data pointed to continuing economic progress in the region. BHP Billiton Ltd. and Anglo American Plc led miners to the best performance of the 19 industry groups on the equity gauge as iron ore in China jumped to a two-week high. Emerging-market shares halted a two-day slide as Brazil’s Ibovespa rose after the government signaled stepped up efforts to trim a budget deficit, fueling optimism that lawmakers will support measures aimed at restoring the country’s finances. Bonds Benchmark Treasury 10-year note yield was little changed at 1.55 per cent, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. It hasn’t closed above 1.6 per cent since June 23, the day the U.K. voted to leave the European Union. Investors turned even more neutral on Treasuries in the week ended Aug. 22, with both long and short positions declining, a JPMorgan Chase & Co. survey showed. The Fed chief is scheduled to speak at an annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Aug. 26, at a time when vice chairman Stanley Fischer and other Fed colleagues have stated that interest rates may still rise in 2016.  Officials are trying to balance their desire to hike this year, following liftoff from near zero in December, with longer-term concerns that slowing global growth may prevent the policy rate from rising to levels seen in previous economic cycles. “It’s the boring part ahead of Yellen,” said David Keeble, New York-based head of fixed-income strategy at Credit Agricole SA. “The Fed can control the short end to some extent—that control has lessened with each promise they’ll hike which hasn’t been fulfilled. But if Yellen does give a firm signal we’ll get a rate hike fairly soon, perhaps September or December, we’ll definitely react.” Yesterday’s US$26 billion (RM104.52 billion) US two-year note sale drew a yield of 0.76 per cent. Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place bids with the Treasury, purchased 25.2 per cent, the highest allocation since May and exceeding the 16.3 per cent average at the previous 10 auctions. The yield premium that investors demand for holding Italian 10-year debt instead of benchmark German bunds has widened from a four-month low reached on Aug. 15. Already struggling with sluggish growth and a banking crisis, Italy is heading for a referendum as Prime Minister Matteo Renzi attempts to overhaul the constitution. Currencies The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the currency against 10 major peers, rose 0.1 per cent after dropping throughout most of the trading day. The greenback lost 0.1 per cent to 100.24 yen, and rose 0.1 per cent to US$1.1306 per euro. “The way investors are starting to get biased right now is that yes, maybe we get a little bit of a boost to the dollar from this one hike this year, but if the longer-term picture is still relatively benign, this supports risk sentiment” and works against the dollar, Vassili Serebriakov, a foreign-exchange strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in New York, said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “The bias is still for Yellen to be quite dovish, and if there’s a risk of a surprise, maybe it’s a little less dovish than more dovish.” South Africa’s rand led losses in major currencies after the Daily Maverick said a police unit had ordered Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan to report to its offices tomorrow, raising concern the National Treasury chief may be replaced. Commodities Oil rose 1.5 per cent higher after Reuters reported that Iran is sending “positive signals” that it may support joint action to bolster the oil market, citing unidentified sources in OPEC and the oil industry. Iran hasn’t decided whether to join any action, according to the sources. If OPEC and some other producers agree to cap output at informal talks next month, the resulting price boost may help other suppliers revive output, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote. “This is just more jawboning,” said Sarah Emerson, managing director of ESAI Energy Inc., a consulting company in Wakefield, Massachusetts. “Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia are the OPEC members that everyone is listening to. The market will react to any news that comes from them.” West Texas Intermediate for October delivery rose 69 cents to settle at US$48.10 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices dropped as much as 1.7 per cent earlier.  Brent for October settlement climbed 80 cents, or 1.6 per cent, to US$49.96 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude closed at a US$1.86 premium to WTI. Gold futures for December delivery advanced 0.2 per cent to settle at US$1,346.10 an ounce at 1:54pm on the Comex in New York. The metal lost 1 per cent in the previous two sessions. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Chinese-made US$100b city in Johor 'scares the hell out of everybody' Australia’s Crown Resorts casino staff arrested in China Lufthansa pilots’ strike wreaks havoc on flight schedule Healthcare stocks drag Wall Street lower UK’s Hammond sets target for cyclically-adjusted budget deficit Chinese-made US$100b city in Johor 'scares the hell out of everybody' Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: China goes global as Trump puts America first Reuters Video: Facebook crafts censorship tool to re-enter China, says NYT Reuters Video: Antigua PM gives Prince Harry awkward honeymoon invite MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants MMOTV: A Red Shirts supporter hurls abuse at Bersih supporters Related Articles Cathay Pacific now accepts ringgit for inflight transactions Tabung Haji denies ringgit no longer accepted in Mecca, Medina Bank Negara expected to hold key rate after ringgit slump IMF sifatkan ringgit susut ‘luar kawalan’ negara, jelas PM Najib: IMF supportive of ringgit float Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

LEGAL ISSUES Apple Could Be Facing a $19 Billion Tax Bill From the European Commission The U.S. Treasury Department defended the tech giant and other American companies under investigation for their tax deals. By Kif Leswing Business Insider WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement The European Commission is expected to levy a judgment against Apple in the next few months that could total in the billions of euros. JPMorgan has estimated that Apple could be on the hook for as much as $19 billion--or about 17 billion euros--the Financial Times reports. The commission is accusing Apple of striking a sweetheart tax deal with Ireland, in which the iPhone maker would move its profits to wholly owned Irish subsidiaries to reduce its corporate taxes. Apple has one major defender in its corner, though: the US Treasury Department and, by extension, the Obama administration. The Treasury released a white paper on Wednesday, commissioned by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, that did not mince words while defending American companies, including Apple, Starbucks, and Amazon. It says that the Brussels-based investigation of Apple is "supranational" and essentially accused the European Commission of executing a power grab and unfairly targeting American companies. Here's the money quote from the paper (emphasis added): "The U.S. Treasury Department continues to consider potential responses should the Commission continue its present course. A strongly preferred and mutually beneficial outcome would be a return to the system and practice of international tax cooperation that has long fostered cross-border investment between the United States and EU Member States." Tax is one of the biggest and most touchy policy issues for Apple. Congress investigated Apple's tax arrangements in 2013, which led to CEO Tim Cook testifying before a US Senate subcommittee. Apple has billions of dollars held offshore that it would love to bring back to the US, but Cook has said that he thinks the system is unfair. "The money that's in Ireland that he's probably referring to is money that is subject to U.S. taxes. The tax law right now says we can keep that in Ireland or we can bring it back," Cook told The Washington Post. "We've said at 40 percent, we're not going to bring it back until there's a fair rate. There's no debate about it. Is that legal to do or not legal to do? It is legal to do. It is the current tax law." "It's important for everyone to understand that the allegation made in the E.U. is that Ireland gave us a special deal. Ireland denies that," Cook said. Based on the release of Wednesday's paper, it sounds as if Apple can continue to rely on the Treasury's support while navigating this multibillion transatlantic spat.

Retail & Restaurants: Trump plans to enact the largest tax cuts since World War II. That would put more money in people's pockets and likely cause folks to buy more stuff and eat out more at restaurants, argues UBS. Banks: A key part of Trump's economic vision is to scale back regulations. He wants to scrap Dodd-Frank, the law to rein in big banks that President Obama signed after the financial crisis. Banks like JPMorgan have complained loudly that Dodd-Frank has hurt their profits. UBS says getting rid of the law (or even just parts of the law) could boost the financial sector's bottom line. Interest rates are also expected to be higher under Trump. Energy: Energy and tobacco might see a boost from a Trump presidency as well if he scales back regulations. Trump has talked about how he wants to "unleash" America's energy potential. The U.S. is already on track to be energy independent by as early as 2020 because of the explosion of oil and natural gas drilling in recent years. Defense: UBS expects both Trump and Hillary Clinton would be positive for the defense industry. Both candidates have voiced support for military spending, although Trump mentions it more often. Clinton's website says she supports "sustainable" military spending. Related: Would Clinton's plan really create 10 million jobs? Clinton better for market overall Despite these headline winners, UBS predicts stocks and bonds will tank if Trump wins. "Markets in general are apt to do better under a Clinton Administration," says UBS. The problem is Trump's tax cuts are coupled with policies that make businesses nervous. There's concern Trump would start a trade war and restrict immigration to the point companies can't get the workers they need. On top of that, Trump's policies are expected to add heavily to the U.S. debt. Related: Trump's new problem: His lead on economic issues is gone The National Associates of Business Economics came to a similar conclusion when it surveyed over 400 of its members and found the vast majority believe Clinton would be the best candidate for the U.S. economy. Trump actually came in third in the NABE poll, behind Libertarian Gary Johnson. According to UBS, the best case scenario for investors is Clinton winning the presidency and Republicans maintaining control of at least the House of Representatives. A Democratic sweep of the White House and Congress could cause the biggest headaches for all businesses. "Who controls the House and Senate -- and by what margin -- will therefore matter every bit as much to investors as who sits behind the desk in the Oval Office," wrote UBS.

A Democratic sweep of the White House and Congress could cause the biggest headaches for all businesses. "Who controls the House and Senate -- and by what margin -- will therefore matter every bit as much to investors as who sits behind the desk in the Oval Office," wrote UBS.

LEGAL ISSUES Apple Could Be Facing a $19 Billion Tax Bill From the European Commission The U.S. Treasury Department defended the tech giant and other American companies under investigation for their tax deals. By Kif Leswing Business Insider WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement The European Commission is expected to levy a judgment against Apple in the next few months that could total in the billions of euros. JPMorgan has estimated that Apple could be on the hook for as much as $19 billion--or about 17 billion euros--the Financial Times reports. The commission is accusing Apple of striking a sweetheart tax deal with Ireland, in which the iPhone maker would move its profits to wholly owned Irish subsidiaries to reduce its corporate taxes. Apple has one major defender in its corner, though: the US Treasury Department and, by extension, the Obama administration. The Treasury released a white paper on Wednesday, commissioned by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, that did not mince words while defending American companies, including Apple, Starbucks, and Amazon. It says that the Brussels-based investigation of Apple is "supranational" and essentially accused the European Commission of executing a power grab and unfairly targeting American companies. Here's the money quote from the paper (emphasis added): "The U.S. Treasury Department continues to consider potential responses should the Commission continue its present course. A strongly preferred and mutually beneficial outcome would be a return to the system and practice of international tax cooperation that has long fostered cross-border investment between the United States and EU Member States." Tax is one of the biggest and most touchy policy issues for Apple. Congress investigated Apple's tax arrangements in 2013, which led to CEO Tim Cook testifying before a US Senate subcommittee. Apple has billions of dollars held offshore that it would love to bring back to the US, but Cook has said that he thinks the system is unfair. "The money that's in Ireland that he's probably referring to is money that is subject to U.S. taxes. The tax law right now says we can keep that in Ireland or we can bring it back," Cook told The Washington Post. "We've said at 40 percent, we're not going to bring it back until there's a fair rate. There's no debate about it. Is that legal to do or not legal to do? It is legal to do. It is the current tax law." "It's important for everyone to understand that the allegation made in the E.U. is that Ireland gave us a special deal. Ireland denies that," Cook said. Based on the release of Wednesday's paper, it sounds as if Apple can continue to rely on the Treasury's support while navigating this multibillion transatlantic spat.

The government may hold a roadshow for potential investors in the last week of September and sell at least $10 billion of bonds early the following month, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. The timing and size of the deal may change depending on market conditions, they said, with one person saying the kingdom wouldn’t be concerned by a potential U.S. interest rate increase next month. Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. were hired as global coordinators for the sale, people familiar told Bloomberg in June. Proceeds would be used to help fund an economic transformation plan and plug a budget shortfall caused by the slump in oil prices, they said. The gap is estimated at 13 percent of economic output this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.  Gulf bond sales are surging as governments seek to plug budget gaps after oil’s slump. Bloomberg The kingdom earlier this year hired HSBC banker Fahad Al Saif to start a debt management office responsible for the bond sale. The office is still working on hiring personnel and implementing policies, which could impact the timing, one of the people said. Saudi Arabia also celebrates a week-long religious holiday in September. Debt Downgraded Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the kingdom’s debt to A1 in May, the fifth-highest investment grade and two levels below that of both Abu Dhabi and Qatar, saying the slump in oil prices may lead to a “material deterioration” in the nation’s credit profile. Government debt levels will increase to 30 percent of economic output by 2020 from 7.7 percent, according to targets set out in the transformation plan released in June. The plunge in crude is driving bond sales across the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council as governments seek to fill fiscal gaps the IMF said could reach $900 billion by 2021. “This diversifies their sources of revenue and funding, so I think its very clever,” said Bob Michele, chief investment officer and head of global fixed income at JPMorgan Chase & Co., in an interview on Bloomberg TV on Thursday. “Oil is in a sweet spot now at $40-50 a barrel, it’s not down at $30 a barrel where it was a couple of quarters ago, so it’s good timing for them.” Investors are buying the most amount of protection against a Saudi Arabian debt default in at least five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The net amount of outstanding credit-default swap contracts has climbed to $1.1 billion, according to data from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. CDS for the kingdom have quadrupled over the last two years from about 40 basis points to about 160 basis points. Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Finance declined to comment.
