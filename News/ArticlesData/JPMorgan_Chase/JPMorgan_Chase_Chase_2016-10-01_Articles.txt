READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Jessa Barron Oct 2nd 2016 12:21PM If you're thinking about opening a new rewards credit card, you may be having a hard time figuring out which card will match your wants and needs, especially since so many major credit cards offer top-notch rewards. Whether you're a new credit card holder or you've been using multiple cards for years, you'll want to be sure to maximize the benefits offered by your rewards credit cards. We've detailed three simple ways to ensure you're getting the most from your rewards credit cards. Choose the right card for your needs From cash back rewards to travel points and everything in between, there are a lot of rewards credit cards out there to choose from, so what's the trick to finding the right card for your needs? One of the easiest ways you can get the most back from your credit card is to choose one that aligns with your spending habits and interests. For example, if you commute for work or you take the kids to school, soccer practice and other extracurricular activities, a credit card that gives you cash back on gas purchases may be best for you because you'll be earning rewards on purchases you're already planning to make. Similarly, if you're a big foodie who enjoys trying out new, trendy restaurants, you'll want a credit card that gives you rewards for dining out. No matter where your interests lie, there's a card for you. To help you get started on the right foot, here's some of the top options for cash back and travel rewards credit cards.

Up Next See Gallery Discover More Like This of SEE ALL BACK TO SLIDE SHOW CAPTION + HIDE CAPTION – Best cash back credit cards Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express If you frequent the grocery store, gas station or department stores, the Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express (a NextAdvisor advertiser) is for you. This card gives you 6% cash back at U.S. supermarkets (on up to $6,000/year, then it's 1%), 3% cash back on gas and select department store purchases, such as Kohl's, Macy's and Nordstrom, and 1% cash back on all other purchases. American Express also has a special offer that gets you 5% cash back on travel purchases in the first 6 months (on up to $4,000 in purchases, then it's 1%). Cardholders will also enjoy a 0% intro APR for 12 months on both purchases and balance transfers (with a 3% balance transfer fee). Plus, when you spend $1,000 in the first 3 months, you'll receive a $150 bonus! Although there is a $95 annual fee associated with this credit card, it may be worth the fee if you use the card for all of your grocery, gas and department store purchases. That said, if you're looking for a card with no annual fee, its sister card, the Blue Cash Everyday Card from American Express, offers similar cash back rewards, the same 5% bonus offer, a $100 intro bonus as well as a 0% intro APR for 12 months on purchases and balance transfers (with a 3% balance transfer fee). Chase Freedom - $150 BonusChase Freedom - $150 Bonus is another one of our top-rated cash back credit cards. It earns you 5% cash back on combined purchases in rotating categories (on up to $1,500/quarter, then it's 1%) as well as 1% cash back on any other purchases. While it may not be best for all of your regular purchases because the categories rotate on a quarterly basis, it's still a top-notch cash back credit card because its rewards usually match seasonal purchases you'll likely make throughout the year. For example, it earned 5% cash back at restaurants and wholesale clubs from July through September, and it earns 5% back at department stores, wholesale clubs and drug stores from October through December. It's important to note that you'll need to sign up for the rotating categories each quarter, but Chase will send you text or email reminders so you don't forget. As an added bonus, after you spend $500 in the first 3 months, you can earn a $150 bonus! There's no annual fee with Chase Freedom - $150 Bonus and cardholders can look forward to a generous 15-month 0% intro APR period on purchases and balance transfers (with a 5% balance transfer fee). If you're looking for a card with the same intro bonus that earns you a flat rate on every purchase, check out Chase Freedom Unlimited, which earns you 1.5% cash back on all purchases. Discover it - Cashback Match Another card that offers cash back on rotating categories, but is available to those with not-so-perfect credit is Discover it - Cashback Match. This card earns you 5% cash back on purchases in select categories -- from October through December you'll get 5% at Amazon.com, department stores and Sam's Club -- (up to $1,500/quarter, then it's 1%) as well as 1% cash back on all other purchases. Plus, at the end of your first year as a card member (note it's not calendar years), Discover will match all of the cash back you've earned. This means if you've earned $500, Discover will match that and you'll receive $1,000! Discover it - Cashback Match also offers a generous 12-month 0% intro APR period on purchases and balance transfers (with a 3% balance transfer fee) and you'll never have to pay an annual feel with this credit card. Those looking for a similar card that earns travel rewards will want to check out Discover it Miles, which earns a flat 1.5 miles per $1 spent on all purchases, has the same Discover match feature and more. Visit our cash back credit card reviews to learn more about these cards and other top options. Best travel rewards credit cards Chase Sapphire Preferred Card Holding the No. 1 spot in our Travel Rewards Credit Card Analysis for its outstanding hotel and flight redemption value of $2.19 per $100 spent is the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card. To start, this credit card earns an unlimited 2 points for every $1 spent on travel and dining, plus 1 point for every $1 spent on any other purchases. Next, after you spend $4,000 in the first 3 months from account opening, you'll earn 50,000 bonus points -- that's worth $625 toward travel when you redeem through Chase Ultimate Rewards! One major perk of the card is its points flexibility, as you have the option to transfer your points to another leading airline or hotel loyalty program at a 1:1 ratio for free. This means 100,000 Chase points equal 100,000 airline or hotel points/miles. On the other hand, if you decide to redeem your rewards for airfare, hotels, car rentals or cruises through Chase Ultimate Rewards, you'll get 25% more value. Something to note about the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card is its annual fee of $95, which is waived for the first year. Cardholders who frequently travel overseas can rest easy knowing that this card has no foreign transaction fees and includes some travel protection, like travel accident insurance and lost luggage reimbursement. Barclaycard Arrival Plus World Elite MasterCard The Barclaycard Arrival Plus World Elite MasterCard is another option if you're looking for a card with some great travel rewards on every purchase you make. That's because this card earns an unlimited 2 miles for every $1 spent on all purchases, which makes things easy because there's no need to worry about using your card for specific purchases. You also have the option to earn even more miles, as this card gives you 5% of your miles back toward your next redemption every time you redeem your miles -- for example, when you redeem 100,000 miles, 5,000 miles will be deposited into your rewards account. And when you spend $3,000 in the first 90 days, you'll earn 50,000 bonus miles -- that's enough to redeem for a $500 travel statement credit! Rounding out the card are no foreign transaction fees, a 12-month 0% intro APR on balance transfers made within 45 days of account opening and an $89 annual fee that's waived your first year. Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card Another top-option for travel rewards is the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card. It earns an unlimited 2 miles for every $1 you spend on every purchase, plus, you'll get 40,000 bonus miles -- that's worth $400 in travel -- when you spend $3,000 within 3 months of approval! The $59 annual fee is waived for the first year, you won't have to pay any foreign transaction fees when you travel overseas and the card comes with extended warranty protection. Check out our travel rewards credit card reviews to see a side-by-side comparison of these cards and learn about some of the other top names in travel rewards. Read the terms and conditions Equally as important as choosing the right rewards credit card for your needs is to understand how those rewards programs work. You'll want to be sure you read the full terms and conditions associated with the card you're applying for or own to know how your rewards are earned and how to redeem your earned rewards. This will clearly explain everything you need to know. After all, the cash back rewards or points you've accrued won't do you any good if they expire before you can redeem them. Some credit cards, like the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Credit Card or Chase Freedom Unlimited, for example, have no expiration dates for their rewards as long as the card remains open, while rewards earned with cards like the Citi Double Cash Card - 18 month BT offer will expire if you haven't earned any cash back for purchases or payments in 12 months. Although most cards will likely have terms that match the former, it's important to look into this, as you don't want to be surprised when your rewards disappear one day. You should also be aware of when and how you can redeem your rewards. If you want some flexibility when you redeem your rewards, you'll want to select a card that allows you redeem them the way you choose. Similarly, you'll want to be aware of the minimum rewards required for redemption, as those looking for the ability to redeem when they want will not want a card like the Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi that only lets you redeem your rewards as an annual reward coupon in your February billing statement. Another noteworthy detail to pay attention to in the terms and conditions is whether or not your credit card can help you with warranties on larger purchases (e.g., televisions, dishwashers or other home appliances). Some merchants will offer you an extended warranty if you pay for your purchases with a particular branded credit card, so you can avoid paying out of pocket for an extra year on a warranty. It should be noted that if anything in the terms and conditions is unclear, you can always call the card issuer to ask for clarification. Pay your bill on time In order to get the most from your credit cards, you'll want to avoid racking up any extra costs. You can do this by paying your bill on time, which helps you avoid paying late fees and penalty APRs. If you fail to pay your bill on time, you could also be at risk of losing the card's rewards, as some credit card issuers will put a halt on your earnings while you have an outstanding bill, or worse, you could completely lose the rewards you've already earned. What's even more detrimental to missing payments is that your credit scores could take a hit if you repeatedly fail to pay your bill on time. This is why it's extremely important to make sure you use your card responsibility, and only make purchases that you know you can afford to pay down. It should be noted that if you find yourself carrying a balance on a high-interest credit card, you may want to consider completing a balance transfer. While you will likely have to pay a balance transfer fee -- unless you opt for a card with a $0 intro balance transfer fee like Chase Slate -- this one-time fee is likely a lot cheaper than the interest you're currently paying on your credit card. Another thing to remember is if you're having trouble making your payments because of the due date, you can always reach out to your credit card issuer and request to have your due date moved to a different day of the month.

Widespread press reports about Deutsche Bank clients and counterparties reducing their financial exposure to the bank, including their derivatives exposures, alarmed market participants. At the same time, JPMorgan warns, the amount borrowed by euro-area banks at the ECB’s USD auction this week spiked to $6.35bn raising fears about funding. We need to wait for next week to see if this elevated dollar borrowing by euro area banks persists beyond quarter-end. But as JPMorgan’s Nikolaos Panigirtoglou warns, In our opinion it is not so much funding issues but rather derivatives exposures that more likely to trouble markets going forward if Deutsche Bank concerns continue. This is especially true if these concerns propagate into a confidence crisis inducing more rapid unwinding of derivative contracts. As we have detailed previously, Deutsche has the world’s largest so-called derivatives book—its portfolio of financial contracts based on the value of other assets. As Forbes notes, it peaked at over $75 trillion, about 20 times German GDP, but had shrunk to around $46 trillion by the end of last year. That’s around 12% of the total notional value of derivatives outstanding worldwide ($384 trillion), according to the Bank for International Settlements. As a reminder, if the liquidity run forces DB to start unwinding or being forced to novate derivatives, it could get ugly. JPMorgan bank analysts confirm the size of DB’s book, and note that BIS data provide an alternative but indirect way to gauge the size of derivatives exposures. According to BIS data the exposure of foreign banks to German counterparties via derivatives contracts stood at $312bn as of Q1 2016. Source: BIS This is significantly lower than the $408bn reported for Q1 2015, suggesting that foreign banks have cut their derivatives exposures to German counterparties significantly over the past year. But at $312bn this exposure is still large even if Deutsche Bank accounts for a fraction of this. *  *  * As we have noted previously, Deutsche Bank has around EUR 560 billion in deposits (for now) and so theoretically they do not have a funding issue. But as we have seen numerous times in Deutsche’s history above (and obviously in many other banks), when the runs start, they seldom end peacefully (and funding sources disappear very quickly). Which perhaps explains this from Germany’s financial regulator… The head of Germany’s financial regulator warned on Saturday of “negative perceptions that could lead to downward spirals on the markets”, at the end of a week that saw Deutsche Bank shares battered by a crisis of confidence.   In an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper due to be published on Sunday, the head of Bafin, Felix Hufeld, declined to comment specifically on Deutsche Bank, Germany’s biggest bank.   But he said: “I warn people not to let themselves be drawn into a kind of downward spiral of negative perception. Not every nervous market reaction is backed by objective facts.” Roughly translated as “Don’t panic, we have everything contained.” Now where have we heard that before? One thing is clear: Friday’s desperate rumor-driven ramp saved some of that deposit base as going out at record lows into a long-weekend would not have been confidence-inspiring for the deposit base. But, as JPMorgan makes clear – and we have reiterated numerous times, it’s the derivatives that matter and as the chart below shows,counterparties were piling into protection en masse – even as speculators bid up the stock on a quiet Friday afternoon. Remember how many times investors were told that Lehman had no liquidity or funding problems? However, as noted previously, Lehman failed as a result of its corporate counterparties suffocating the bank by rapidly pulling out their liquidity lines. Lehman, however, was lucky in that it didn’t have retail depositors: it’s death would have likely come far faster as the capital panic was not limited to institutions but also included a retail depositor bank run. This is where Deutsche Bank is very different from Lehman, and far riskier, because if the institutional panic spreads to the depositor base, which as the table below shows amounts to some €566 billion in total, and €307 billion in retail deposits… … then all bets are off. Which is why it is so critical for Angela Merkel to halt the plunging stock price, an indicator DB’s retail clients, simplistically (and not erroneously) now equate with the bank’s viability, and the lower the price drops, the faster they will pull their deposits, the quicker DB’s liquidity hits zero, the faster the self-fulfilling prophecy of Deutsche Bank’s death is confirmed. Which ultimately means that DB really has four options: raise capital (sell equity, convert CoCos, which may results in an even bigger drop in the stock price due to dilution or concerns the liquidity raise may not be sufficient), approach the ECB for a liquidity bridge (this may also backfire as counterparties scramble to flee a central bank-backstopped institution), appeal for a state bailout (Merkel has so far said “Nein”) or implement a bail-in, eliminating billions in unsecured claims (and deposits) and leading to a full-blown systemic bank run as depositors everywhere rush to withdraw their savings, leading to a collapse of the fractional reserve banking mode (in which there is only 10 cents in physical deliverable cash for every dollar in depositor claims). Which of the four choices Deutsche Bank will pick should become clear in the coming days. Until it does, it will keep the market on edge and quite volatile, because as Jeff Gundlach explained today, a “do nothing” scenario is no longer an option for CEO John Cryan as the market will keep pushing the price of DB lower until it either fails, or is bailed out.

There are three reasons to conclude that JPMorgan Chase is a good stock for dividend investors. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 1, 2016 at 9:40AM The Chase Tower in Phoenix, Arizona. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. If you're a dividend investor, then you should consider owning shares of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). There are multiple reasons that the nation's biggest bank by assets is a good stock for dividend investors. An above-average yield The first is that JPMorgan Chase's shares yield more than the average stock. Its investors, therefore, get a larger check each quarter relative to the price of their shares than they would get by investing in a stock with an ordinary yield. The typical stock on the S&P 500 yields 2.1%. That's meaningfully below JPMorgan Chase's 2.7% yield. The story is similar, though not to the same extent, if you look at other major bank stocks. The average yield on the KBW Bank Index, which tracks 23 of the biggest banks in the country, is 2.5%. Stock/Index Dividend Yield JPMorgan Chase 2.7% KBW Bank Index* 2.5% S&P 500* 2.1% *Average. Data sources: YCharts.com, The Wall Street Journal. A reasonable payout ratio When a stock yields more than the broader market, or more than other stocks in the same industry, the first thing to check is if the company pays out a larger share of earnings each year than its peers do. It isn't necessarily bad if that's the case, but it would explain why the yield is higher. A stock with a high payout ratio, moreover, has less room to raise its dividend going forward. Let's say, for instance, that a company pays out only 30% of its annual earnings each year. That leaves plenty of space to increase the payout. But if the company already distributes 90% of its net income to shareholders, there's a limit to how much more that can grow. JPMorgan Chase distributes 34% of its earnings. That's right in line with other blue chip bank stocks. The median stock on the KBW Bank Index sports a payout ratio of 34%. While JPMorgan Chase's payout ratio is thus on par for big bank stocks, it's nevertheless low enough to allow JPMorgan Chase to consistently grow its payout in the future. A history of dividend raises Just because a bank has a reasonable payout ratio doesn't mean that it will, in fact, boost its dividend on a regular basis. The best way to determine this is to look, instead, at a bank's history of doing so. The chart that shows this in JPMorgan Chase's case seems, at first, to be all over the board. Prior to the financial crisis, it paid out around $0.35 per share each quarter. That dropped to $0.05 per share when the crisis struck, fueled by the need to boost capital and satisfy regulators that the bank had enough fire power to survive the downturn. JPM Dividend data by YCharts. But the important thing to take away from the chart isn't what happened during the crisis, it's rather what has happened to JPMorgan Chase's dividend since then. Namely, the $2.5 trillion bank has raised it every year since 2010, bumping it up most recently to $0.48 per share. The net result is that JPMorgan Chase not only yields more than the average stock, while paying out a similar share of its earnings, but the New York City-based bank has also demonstrated convincingly that it's committed to raising its dividend on a regular basis, if not yearly. It's for these three reasons, then, that I believe JPMorgan Chase is a good stock for dividend investors. John Maxfield has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Only the Commonwealth Bank of Australia – out of the 13 investment banks invited – signed the letter, which was triggered by a court case last year. Sources familiar with Goldman Sachs’ decision said it declined to sign the petition letter over fears of setting a precedent that would see individual court cases being influenced, and opening the door to a flood of other future petition campaigns. Airport outrage shows Hong Kong government full of hot air on LGBT rights Fern Ngai, chief executive of Community Business, the non-profit group behind the campaign, said: “The petition, which was set up last year, is open to the public and we encouraged everyone to sign. In terms of why so few banks signed, it could be attributed to a number of  factors including having to go through internal legal and compliance approval processes, or that an online public petition may not be an appropriate channel for  advocating for change, for example, in government policies or for LGBT rights. Not signing the petition does not necessarily indicate lack of support.” Community Business asked the banks to support the petition because the same banks last year had lobbied for and received awards from the non-profit group endorsing them as the city’s top employers supporting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) inclusiveness in the workplace. Other banks that were named top LGBT employers last year, but which hadn't signed the new petition, included Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Standard Chartered, Barclays Capital, Nomura, ANZ, UBS and Credit Suisse. HSBC spokesman Gareth Hewett said the bank “prefers to work through other channels to support the LGBT community, using our senior leadership where appropriate and ensuring they are kept up to date with the latest developments”. University of Hong Kong accused of trying to brainwash campus with unisex, LGBT-friendly toilets Steven Victorin, global head of corporate banking subsidiaries at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said: “It is true in Hong Kong that a couple in a same-sex marriage doesn’t have the ability to secure visas for both individuals in the same way other married couples can. “If you are looking at the fundamental rights of securing visas today, there are limitations that we look forward to working with the appropriate government agencies on. It’s going to take some time,” He added that lobbying in Hong Kong for this is “not really something that’s being done in the community here”. Community Business started the campaign in support of a woman identified only by her pseudonym “QT”, who took the Hong Kong government to court last year after the Immigration Department denied her same-sex spouse a dependent visa, even though the couple were legally married in a foreign country. Her lawyers argued that the visa would have routinely been granted to a heterosexual couple. QT lost the case in March but lodged an appeal which will be heard again in court next year. Her case has since inspired more suits by other couples in similar situations. Ngai said her group received eight more enquiries relating to such cases.   This article was amended to correct the headline and the comment attributed to Community Business.

Annie Korkki, 37, who works for JP Morgan Chase in Denver, and Robin Korkki, 42, a trader from Chicago, were found motionless in their bed by hotel staff last week. Facebook 7 Annie (left) and Robin (right) have been found dead at their luxury Seychelles villa after drinking throughout the day on Wednesday Facebook 7 Heartbroken relatives of the girls, seen above on their trip, is searching for answers into what led to their sudden deaths They were seen drinking all day and had to be escorted back to their room by staff at Maia Luxury Resort and Spa a week into their vacation on the popular holiday island. The sisters, who had been on holiday on the tropical island off the coast of Africa since September 15, were found unresponsive and were later pronounced dead at the scene by a doctor. A post-mortem carried out on Wednesday found that the girls died from had excess fluid in their lungs, while Annie also had fluid on the brain. Facebook Maia Luxury Resort & Spa 7 The sisters were found dead inside their luxury resort villa at the Maia Luxury Resort and Spa Medics said drug overdoses or alcohol poisoning can cause the fluid, but it could also have come from a viral infection. Dr Patrick Lank, a Northwestern Medicine assistant professor of emergency medicine in Chicago, said: “Two people at the same time is odd. It suggests more of a toxicologic or environmental cause, or a potential infection if they’re travelling together.” A preliminary examination conducted by police indicated there were no signs of violence or aggression on the women’s bodies, The Seychelles Nation reported. The women had been drinking throughout the day on Wednesday and were helped to their room by resort staff around 8.15pm that night. It was the last time they were seen alive.

Brother Chris Korkki, of Minnesota, said: “They were kind and generous and compassionate, and were wonderful people that had a positive impact on a huge number of people.” Authorities in Seychelles were called to the scene after a butler assigned to the villa arrived to find the sisters unresponsive on the same bed. There was no disturbance in the room, police said. While their bodies did not show any signs of trauma, certain medications were confiscated from the room by police as part of their investigation, authorities said. Facebook 7 Annie (above) and her sister had shared photos of their stay in Seychelles on Facebook The Korkki sisters’ stay at the resort was originally set to end on September 22, but they had extended it to September 24. They had been touring Africa since September 1 and visited Kenya, Tanzania and Zanzibar before arriving in Seychelles on September 16, according to an itinerary found at the hotel. Both sisters had shared photos of their stay in Seychelles on Facebook, with many showing the resort, where an ocean panoramic villa costs upwards of £1,300 per night. In one photo on September 17 appearing to show the beautiful view from their villa, Annie wrote in the comment section calling it ‘the best place ever’. In another, Annie said their trip was ‘indescribable.’ Facebook Maia Luxury Resort & Spa 7 ‘The best place ever’ ..the Seychelles is located more than 900 miles off Africa’s east coast Annie, who lived in Denver, worked at JP Morgan Chase, according to her Facebook page. Her sister Robin lived in Chicago and is the Head of FX and Metals at Allston Trading. Both are described as healthy women and experienced travellers. “The family is in shock,” brother Chris told KMSP. “Everyone is trying to understand and come to terms with what happened.” Their mother Sue and brother Mike, who both live in Colorado, are currently in Seychelles, pressing local and US officials for answers, The Star-Tribune reported. They are also making arrangements to bring the women back home, Chris told the newspaper. He also noted that at this time, his family has limited information on what led to his sisters’ deaths. Facebook 7 Annie (above) and her sister were both described as adventurous women “At this point, the only details we know are the articles flying around online,” he said. “My mum has been talking with people from the U.S. Embassy. I don’t think they’ve provided her with any information.” The sisters’ bodies are in a mortuary as authorities await autopsy results to determine the cause of death. Local police have been working with the American embassy in Mauritius during their investigation, according to The Seychelles Nation. Facebook 7 The sisters were frequent travellers and had been touring Africa since September 1 The Seychelles is located more than 900 miles off Africa’s east coast and is a tourist destination with its beaches, natural reserves, warm weather and coral reefs. The Maia Luxury Resort and Spa is a twelve-acre property on the secluded Anse Louis located on the island of Mahe. The five-star hotel’s 30 suites, ten ocean-front villas and 20 panoramic villas, each offers guests private pools, a 24-hour personal butler and views of the Indian Ocean, according to its website. The Maia hotel released a statement confirming the sisters were found by a hotel employee who tried to wake them.

At 10:21 a.m. in Johannesburg, the rand dropped 0.4 percent to 13.9520 per dollar, trimming its quarterly and monthly gain to 5.2 percent. The government’s 10-year rand-denominated bond weakened for a third day, with yields climbing six basis points to 8.73 percent, the highest on a closing basis since Sept. 9. Emerging-market assets declined amid anxiety over the wider implications of Deutsche Bank AG’s capital troubles. “Some rand weakness is justified given the Deutsche Bank-inspired global risk-off environment,” John Cairns, strategist at Rand Merchant Bank in Johannesburg, said in a note. “Emerging markets might have been impacted by the reweighting in the JPMorgan Global Bond Index. As we understand it, South Africa’s weight will drop 0.45 basis point to 9.7 percent today, implying around $1 billion in outflows.” About 10 hedge funds that do business with Deutsche Bank have reduced their financial exposure to Germany’s largest lender, Bloomberg News reported. The dollar was boosted Thursday by economic data that strengthened the case for the U.S. Federal Reserve to increase interest rates, trimming appetite for riskier assets.

The rand is also outperforming global currencies against the euro and the pound.

Stung by fines, weakened by negative interest rates and parrying the threat of another recession, financial firms have seen their value shrink by $280 billion in 2016. They represent a measly 11 percent of the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, near the lowest on record and down from a 23 percent weighting a decade ago. While most of the recent focus has been on Germany’s Deutsche Bank AG, where capital concerns erased almost a fourth of its value in less than three weeks, the pain has been widespread. Banks dropped 2.7 percent in September, worsening a year that has already had two of the three biggest monthly slumps since the financial crisis. Yet even with the diminution, the industry’s ability to push around the broader stock market is as strong as ever. A pattern of lockstep moves between financial shares and broader indexes shows them tied together on 87 percent of days in 2016, the most since 2007. In other words, even as their mathematical influence waned, concern the industry will beget the next crisis hasn’t. “Investors fear for systemic risk,” said Dirk Sebrechts, a fund manager who helps oversee about $233 billion at KBC Asset Management in Brussels and has been selling the stocks after briefly turning optimistic in July. “Banks here never really recovered from the multiple crises of the past decade. If we have another one and they go under, the economy and the rest of the market will go down with them.” That banks are still throwing their weight around in the stock market is a rebuke to regulators, who’ve done everything they can to limit the industry’s impact on the economy. Financial companies have been chased away from risk-taking enterprises like proprietary trading, their derivatives business has been reined in and capital reserves increased. Even as their riskier elements are clipped, banks remain a key channel for those trying to restore Europe’s economic health, and devising lending incentives has been a top priority for the European Central Bank. At the same time, traders aren’t convinced policy makers can contain another downturn in the industry, KBC’s Sebrechts said. Responses to previous crises -- negative rates, fines and strict capital requirements -- are hurting more than helping. After spending almost all of the preceding years as Europe’s biggest industry group, they briefly lost the title to health care during the credit crunch in early 2009 and again at the height of sovereign-debt crisis in 2011 and 2012. Since June of this year, they’ve been ranked third. The Stoxx 600 has moved in the same direction as its lenders on all but five weeks this year and on 167 of its 193 trading days. The weekly relationship is tighter than for health-care firms -- the benchmark’s largest sector now -- or even energy stocks, which have gripped investors around the world as oil prices fluctuated in and out of a bull market. A crush of bad news has derailed an industry that was pegged as the biggest driver of Europe’s profit recovery as recently as 2013, when lender earnings were forecast to soar 20 percent. Three years later, Italy’s banking system is struggling to offload billions of euros in bad debt, unexpected losses are ballooning in Credit Suisse Group AG’s trading division and Commerzbank AG scaled back its profit targets and suspended dividends. Deutsche Bank shares are still near all-time lows amid concerns that one of the world’s most systemically important financial institutions can’t cover its legal penalties. Shares of the Frankfurt-based lender jumped 6.4 percent Friday on a report that it is nearing a $5.4 billion settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice in a probe tied to residential mortgage-backed securities. The government had previously requested $14 billion to settle the investigation. The stock lost 3.1 percent in the U.S. It didn’t trade in German as the market was closed for a holiday. For more on escalating concerns about Deutsche Bank’s future, click here. Making it worse in Europe is the degree to which banks are intertwined with the economy, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists, who estimate that companies get about two-thirds of their financing from loans. That’s much more than in the U.S., where firms typically use capital markets to raise cash. While in Europe lending to companies has increased almost every month this year, that growth is merely a fraction of what it was in 2008. “Banks are a critical component of Europe’s economy,” said Emmanuel Cau, a JPMorgan equity strategist in London. “Lending is the engine of growth. If banks don’t lend, the economy can’t perform. That’s why lot of investors first want to take a view on banks before taking a view on the region. It’s very hard to differentiate banks from the broader market.” The ability of shrinking industries to exact outsized influence on equities at large was never more apparent than last year in the U.S., where the S&P 500 Index’s ties to energy stocks surged even after the group became one of the benchmark’s smallest weightings. While making up around 8 percent of the gauge for much of the year, oil shares were 91 percent correlated to the index at their highest level in 2015. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Banks Index is heading for a 23 percent drop this year, with more than three-quarters of its members trading below the value of their assets. Analysts say bank earnings will slump 22 percent in 2016, behind only commodities-linked firms as the biggest decrease among industries. While lenders still make up about 15 percent of Stoxx 600 earnings, that’s compared with 21 percent in 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. With interest rates likely to remain negative in Europe for at least the next two years, the drag on bank profitability is showing no signs of slowing down. But their declining share of European earnings hasn’t made them any less important. “They may be a smaller piece of the puzzle now, but it’s a really key piece if you want to promote growth,” said Francois Savary, who helps oversee the equivalent of $2.8 billion as chief investment officer of Prime Partners in Geneva. “Fear of systemic risk will undermine the whole market. Any problem with Europe’s banking system always brings back bad, bad memories.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The threat of such a large fine has pushed Deutsche shares to record lows, and a cut-price settlement is urgently needed to reverse the trend and help to restore confidence in Germany's largest lender. A media report late on Friday that Deutsche and the US Department of Justice were close to agreeing on a settlement of US$5.4 billion lifted the stock six per cent higher, but that report has not been confirmed. The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that the bank's talks with the DOJ were continuing. Details are in flux, with no deal yet presented to senior decision makers for approval on either side, the paper said, citing people familiar with the matter. “Clearly, so long as a fine of this order of magnitude (US$14 billion) is an even remote possibility, markets worry,” UniCredit Chief Economist Erik F Nielsen wrote in a note yesterday. Deutsche is much smaller than Wall Street rivals such as JPMorgan and Citigroup. But it has significant trading relationships with all of the world's largest finance houses and the International Monetary Fund this year identified it as a bigger potential risk to the wider financial system than any other global bank. Deutsche Chief Executive John Cryan will be in Washington this week for the annual meeting of the IMF, and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported that other executives would join him to try to negotiate a settlement with the US authorities. Like fellow large European banks also under investigation for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities, Credit Suisse and Barclays, Deutsche will want to get a deal done with the current administration still in power. A new administration to be installed after the Nov 8 election will bring unknown risks and likely delays. At home, Deutsche Bank is fighting a rearguard action, seeking to shore up confidence among the public, politicians and regulators who say the bank brought many of its problems upon itself by overreaching itself and then reacting too slowly to the 2008 financial crisis. It suffered a further blow to its image this weekend with a third IT outage in the space of a few months on Saturday that prevented some customers getting access to their money for a short time. Industry support German business leaders from companies including BASF, Daimler, E.ON, RWE and Siemens lined up to defend the bank in a front-page article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung. “German industry needs a Deutsche Bank to accompany us out into the world,” BASF Chairman Juergen Hambrecht said. A spokesman for a blue-chip company that did not feature in the article told Reuters he had been asked by Deutsche for an executive to provide a similar supportive comment. Deutsche Bank and the government in Berlin have had to play a delicate balancing act, emphasising the substance and importance of the bank without implying any need for state aid or willingness to supply it. The bank has a market capitalisation of only around €15.9 billion (RM73.76 billion) and would almost certainly have to raise fresh cash to pay the full DOJ demand. Both the bank and Berlin this week denied reports that the government was preparing a rescue plan. The Bild am Sonntag newspaper wrote yesterday that Deutsche's chairman had informed Berlin just before it disclosed the potential US$14 billion fine but had not asked for help. The same newspaper quoted the president of the Bavarian Finance Centre, Wolfgang Gerke, as saying the German government should step in and buy a 20 per cent stake in the bank before its value fell any further.

WORK-LIFE BALANCE Why Mary Barra Wants You to Ban Work Dinners The CEO of General Motors is also a mother. She has a few suggestions for how to be sensitive to working parents. By Melissa Matthews Melissa Matthews has a BA in mass communications and sociology from Arizona State University and is pursuing an MA in magazine journalism at New York University. She previously worked in corporate communications and marketing in the consumer packaged goods industry. @M_Matthews Editorial intern@M_Matthews WRITE A COMMENT Mary Barra, Chairman and CEO of General Motors. CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Schmoozing over a long business dinner is standard practice at many companies, but if you want to keep employees who are also parents happy, you should think seriously about banning them--at least according to Mary Barra, the CEO of General Motors. She and Jamie Dimon, the CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase spoke about how companies can be more sensitive to parents in the workplace at an event hosted by The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. So why ban dinners? Along with happy hours, dinners provide valuable face time with the boss and co-workers, and that can help boost careers. But for parents who may need to head home after work to relieve a spouse or meet childcare obligations, after-work events can be problematic. Either they go, and put added pressure on their family or the employees skip and they miss the valuable networking opportunity. Instead, the working parents suggest booking business lunches, which allows all employees to have a better work-life balance. Another tip Barra offered: prioritize family commitments the same as you would a work obligation. "I'll say 'the meeting starts at 4:30 and this is going to end at 5:30 because I'm making my child's sporting event.' Everyone then says 'okay, let's be efficient, let's get this done,'" reports the WSJ. Dimon agreed with Barra that parents need to prioritize their home life. He added that parents--fathers in particular--ought to make their families and health a priority. "It's very important that people be deliberate about [preserving their mental and physical health] because they do a pretty good job sometimes of undermining their own life, their health," Dimon told WSJ.

The German lender is throwing its energies into reaching a settlement before next month's U.S. presidential election, with the Department of Justice demanding a fine of up to $14 billion for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities. Its shares didn't trade in Germany on Monday because of a public holiday, but its U.S.-listed stock was down around 2.8 percent at mid-morning. The threat of such a large fine has pushed Deutsche shares to record lows, and a cut-price settlement is urgently needed to help restore confidence in Germany's largest lender. A media report late on Friday that Deutsche and the DOJ were close to agreeing a much lower penalty of $5.4 billion lifted the stock 6 percent higher, but on Monday that report remained unconfirmed. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that the bank's talks with the DOJ were continuing. Details are in flux, with no deal yet presented to senior decision makers for approval on either side, the paper said, citing people familiar with the matter. "Clearly, so long as a fine of this order of magnitude ($14 billion) is an even remote possibility, markets worry," UniCredit Chief Economist Erik F. Nielsen wrote in a note on Sunday. Ratings agency Moody's said it would be positive for bondholders if the lender could settle for around $3.1 billion, while a fine as high as $5.7 billion would dent 2016 profitability but not significantly impair the bank's capital position. POTENTIAL RISK Deutsche is much smaller than Wall Street rivals such as JPMorgan and Citigroup. But it has significant trading relationships with all of the world's largest finance houses and the International Monetary Fund this year identified it as a bigger potential risk to the wider financial system than any other global bank. Deutsche Chief Executive John Cryan will be in Washington this week for the annual meeting of the IMF, and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported that other executives would join him to try to negotiate a settlement with the U.S. authorities. Like fellow large European banks also under investigation for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities - Credit Suisse and Barclays - Deutsche will want to get a deal done with the current administration still in power. A new administration to be installed after the Nov. 8 election will bring unknown risks and likely delays. Domestically, Deutsche Bank is fighting a rearguard action, seeking to shore up confidence among the public, politicians and regulators who say the bank brought many of its problems upon itself by overreaching itself and then reacting too slowly to the 2008 financial crisis.

Deutsche Bank races against time to reach U.S. settlement Reuters 10/2/2016 By Georgina Prodhan and Kathrin Jones © REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo The Deutsche Bank headquarters are seen in Frankfurt Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) is throwing its energies into reaching a settlement before next month's presidential election with U.S. authorities demanding a fine of up to $14 billion for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities. Quotes in the article Basf SE BASFY ▼ 85.23 -1.35 -1.56% UniCredit SpA UNCFF ▲ 2.15 +0.01 +0.47% Barclays PLC BCS ▼ 10.40 -0.15 -1.42% E.ON SE ENAKF ▼ 6.40 -0.28 -4.12% The threat of such a large fine has pushed Deutsche shares to record lows and a cut-price settlement is urgently needed to reverse the trend and help to restore confidence in Germany's largest lender. A media report late on Friday that Deutsche and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) were close to agreeing a settlement of $5.4 billion lifted the stock to close 6 percent higher, but that report has not been confirmed. "Clearly, so long as a fine of this order of magnitude ($14 billion) is an even remote possibility, markets worry," UniCredit's chief economist, Erik F. Nielsen, wrote in a note on Sunday. Deutsche is much smaller than Wall Street rivals such as JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N). But it has significant trading relationships with all of the world's largest finance houses and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) this year identified it as a bigger potential risk to the wider financial system than any other global bank. Deutsche Chief Executive John Cryan will be in Washington this week for the annual meeting of the IMF, and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported that other executives would join him to try to negotiate a settlement with the U.S. authorities. Like fellow large European banks also under investigation for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities, Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) and Barclays (BARC.L), Deutsche will want to get a deal done with the current administration still in power. A new administration to be installed after the Nov. 8 election will bring unknown risks and likely delays. At home, Deutsche Bank is fighting a rearguard action, seeking to shore up confidence among the public, politicians and regulators who say the bank brought many of its problems upon itself by overreaching itself and then reacting too slowly to the 2008 financial crisis. It suffered a further blow to its image this weekend with a third IT outage in the space of a few months on Saturday that prevented some customers getting access to their money for a short time. INDUSTRY SUPPORT German business leaders from companies including BASF (BASFn.DE), Daimler (DAIGn.DE), E.ON (EONGn.DE), RWE (RWEG.DE) and Siemens (SIEGn.DE) lined up to defend the bank in a front-page article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung. "German industry needs a Deutsche Bank to accompany us out into the world," BASF Chairman Juergen Hambrecht said. A spokesman for a blue-chip company that did not feature in the article told Reuters he had been asked by Deutsche for an executive to provide a similar supportive comment. Deutsche Bank and the government in Berlin have had to play a delicate balancing act, emphasizing the substance and importance of the bank without implying any need for state aid or willingness to supply it.© REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski/File Photo A Deutsche Bank logo adorns a wall at the company's headquarters in Frankfurt The bank has a market capitalization of only around 15.9 billion euros ($17.9 billion) and would almost certainly have to raise fresh cash to pay the full DOJ demand. Both the bank and Berlin this week denied reports that the government was preparing a rescue plan. The Bild am Sonntag newspaper wrote on Sunday that Deutsche's chairman had informed Berlin just before it disclosed the potential $14 billion fine but had not asked for help. The same newspaper quoted the president of the Bavarian Finance Centre, Wolfgang Gerke, as saying the German government should step in and buy a 20 percent stake in the bank before its value fell any further. The group represents financial services companies in the southern German state. "Fundamentally, I'm against state interventions," he told the newspaper, but added that in this case a government stake would be "a signal that could turn the whole market".

Momo Inc.’s 123 percent third-quarter return was the fourth-best among U.S.-listed stocks with market values of at least $2 billion. The Chaoyang-based company, which went public in New York in 2014 as China’s answer to the Tinder dating app, has since expanded into the live-streaming business. Credit Suisse AG says that the industry has grown 175 percent over the past year, and analysts see more gains for Momo with their average 12-month target prices forecasting a 23 percent rise. The live-streaming boom in countries from Russia to India is fueled by more smartphones, cheaper bandwidth and the shift from personal computers to mobile. In China, live-streaming emerged as a cheaper pastime option for millennials who lack the budget for entertainment, Credit Suisse analysts say. The potential to monetize the trend is likely to keep growing, according to analysts from Rosenblatt Securities to JPMorgan Chase & Co. ‘Minutes of Fame’ “For some Chinese Internet users, online video may simply be a desire for 15 minutes of fame, but for Momo it means a big potential for growth,” said Jun Zhang, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities. “The stock rally is a reaction to the revenue growth, and there is an expectation of solid growth next quarter as well.” Christian Arnell, an external spokesman for Momo, said the company declined to comment on the stock performance. The shares slipped 4.5 percent to $22.50 last week. The competition for people eager to stream themselves live is heating up, with the number of platforms growing to 150 this year, said Zoe Zhao, a Credit Suisse analyst. Live-streaming will become a $5 billion industry in China in 2017, half the size of the nation’s booming mobile-gaming market, Zhao said. She predicts the industry will consolidate into fewer players as growth slows down next year. Zhao has Momo as one of her top two picks in the industry because online video is a well-synced extension of its location-based messaging services with an established audience, not its sole focus. “The interactions used to be through image/text only, hence less vivid,” Zhao, who initiated her Momo coverage in September with an overweight call, said by e-mail. “Daily activities and users’ engagement level is expected to pick up after introducing the live-streaming function to the app.” Momo’s second-quarter revenue jumped 222 percent from a year earlier, fueled by additional users paying for live-video service, the company said in a statement in August. The monetization potential of live broadcasting “has just kicked in,” according to Alex Yao, a JPMorgan analyst who started covering Momo with an overweight call shortly after the quarterly results were announced. The stock slid 3.5 percent at 9:53 a.m. on Monday in New York in the fourth day of declines. Delist-Relist For Brendan Ahern, who invests in Chinese ADRs including Momo, the stock’s performance has outweighed concern about management’s recent flip-flop on going private. Just six months after raising $248 million in an initial public offering, Momo in June 2015 received a buyout proposal from a group led by its chief executive officer. The consortium, which included Sequoia Capital China Investment Management, withdrew the bid last month. “There have been some ups and downs, but now we see a strong momentum driven by a boom in online video,” Ahern said by phone last week. “Online video is a hot industry right now, and Momo makes some important steps to cash in on the trend.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

 Why Deutsche Bank wants to settle a $14 billion fine as soon as possible Rachael Levy and Reuters Oct. 2, 2016, 12:54 PM 5,321 facebook linkedin twitter email print A man walks past Deutsche Bank offices in London, December 5, 2013. REUTERS/Luke MacGregor The troubles aren't over for Deutsche Bank, despite a slightly optimistic media report on Friday. The German bank has been facing several issues. US authorities are demanding a fine of up to $14 billion for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities, and Deutsche Bank is throwing its energies into reaching a settlement before next month's presidential election. On Friday, Agence-France Presse reported that Deutsche and the US Department of Justice were close to agreeing a settlement of $5.4 billion — much lower than the $14 billion expected, though that report has not been independently confirmed. The news Friday popped up Deutsche's stock price over 15%. Whatever the end cost of the settlement, the threat of such a large fine has pushed Deutsche shares to record lows and a cut-price settlement is urgently needed to reverse the trend and restore confidence in the bank, which is Germany's largest lender. "Clearly, so long as a fine of this order of magnitude ($14 billion) is an even remote possibility, markets worry," UniCredit's chief economist, Erik F. Nielsen, wrote in a note on Sunday. Other issues have plagued the bank in recent weeks, including rumors of a bailout — or lack thereof — from the German government and big hedge funds decreasing their exposure to the bank. Deutsche is much smaller than Wall Street rivals such as JPMorgan and Citigroup. But it has significant trading relationships with all of the world's largest finance houses, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) this year identified it as a bigger potential risk to the wider financial system than any other global bank. Deutsche Chief Executive John Cryan will be in Washington this week for the annual meeting of the IMF, and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported that other executives would join him to try to negotiate a settlement with the US authorities.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 12:00 AM, October 3, 2016 Updated: 4:35 AM, October 4, 2016 FRANKFURT - Deutsche Bank <DB.N> shares resumed falling on Monday after recovering from a record low at the end of last week, as hopes faded of a swift deal with U.S. authorities over a multi-billion dollar penalty. The German lender is throwing its energies into reaching a settlement before next month's U.S. presidential election, with the Department of Justice demanding a fine of up to $14 billion for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities. Its shares didn't trade in Germany <DBKGn.DE> on Monday because of a public holiday, but its U.S.-listed stock was down around 2.8 percent at mid-morning. The threat of such a large fine has pushed Deutsche shares to record lows, and a cut-price settlement is urgently needed to help restore confidence in Germany's largest lender. A media report late on Friday that Deutsche and the DOJ were close to agreeing a much lower penalty of $5.4 billion lifted the stock 6 percent higher, but on Monday that report remained unconfirmed. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that the bank's talks with the DOJ were continuing. Details are in flux, with no deal yet presented to senior decision makers for approval on either side, the paper said, citing people familiar with the matter. "Clearly, so long as a fine of this order of magnitude ($14 billion) is an even remote possibility, markets worry," UniCredit Chief Economist Erik F. Nielsen wrote in a note on Sunday. Ratings agency Moody's said it would be positive for bondholders if the lender could settle for around $3.1 billion, while a fine as high as $5.7 billion would dent 2016 profitability but not significantly impair the bank's capital position. POTENTIAL RISK Deutsche is much smaller than Wall Street rivals such as JPMorgan <JPM.N> and Citigroup <C.N>. But it has significant trading relationships with all of the world's largest finance houses and the International Monetary Fund this year identified it as a bigger potential risk to the wider financial system than any other global bank. Deutsche Chief Executive John Cryan will be in Washington this week for the annual meeting of the IMF, and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported that other executives would join him to try to negotiate a settlement with the U.S. authorities. Like fellow large European banks also under investigation for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities - Credit Suisse <CSGN.S> and Barclays <BARC.L> - Deutsche will want to get a deal done with the current administration still in power. A new administration to be installed after the Nov. 8 election will bring unknown risks and likely delays. Domestically, Deutsche Bank is fighting a rearguard action, seeking to shore up confidence among the public, politicians and regulators who say the bank brought many of its problems upon itself by overreaching itself and then reacting too slowly to the 2008 financial crisis. It suffered a further blow to its image this weekend with a third IT outage in the space of a few months on Saturday, denying some customers access to their money for a short time. INDUSTRY SUPPORT German business leaders from companies including BASF <BASFn.DE>, Daimler <DAIGn.DE>, E.ON <EONGn.DE>, RWE <RWEG.DE> and Siemens <SIEGn.DE> lined up to defend the bank in a front-page article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung. "German industry needs a Deutsche Bank to accompany us out into the world," BASF Chairman Juergen Hambrecht said. A spokesman for a blue-chip company that did not feature in the article told Reuters he had been asked by Deutsche for an executive to provide a similar supportive comment. Deutsche Bank and the government in Berlin have had to play a delicate balancing act, emphasising the substance and importance of the bank without implying any need for state aid or willingness to supply it. The bank has a market capitalisation of only about 15.9 billion euros ($17.9 billion) and would almost certainly have to raise fresh cash to pay the full DOJ demand. Both the bank and Berlin this week denied reports that the government was preparing a rescue plan. The Bild am Sonntag newspaper wrote on Sunday that Deutsche's chairman had informed Berlin just before it disclosed the potential $14 billion fine but had not asked for help. The same newspaper quoted the president of the Bavarian Finance Centre, Wolfgang Gerke, as saying that the German government should step in and buy a 20 percent stake in the bank before its value fell any further. The group represents financial services companies in the southern German state. "Fundamentally, I'm against state interventions," he told the newspaper, but added that in this case a government stake would be "a signal that could turn the whole market".

(file photo by Daniel Acker/Bloomberg) Wall Street says annual holiday rally isn't in cards this year By Oliver Renick Bloomberg Oct 2, 2016 (…) The statue of a bull in the financial district of New York City. (file photo by Daniel Acker/Bloomberg) It’s been low-hanging fruit for decades: Buy stocks when the leaves start to turn in the Northeast, and get ready to harvest gains. This year the crop looks spoiled. That’s going by forecasts from Wall Street strategists, whose trepidation about everything from election politics to interest rates and valuations has left them in an unusually bearish mood before this year’s holidays. Among 19 surveyed by Bloomberg, the average estimate calls for the S&P 500 Index to end 2016 at 2,171, about 1 percent below where the gauge closed on Thursday. Since 1970, the S&P 500’s best quarter has been the fourth, on average, with the trend particularly prominent during the bull market that began in 2009. The benchmark gauge has climbed an average 6.7 percent from Sept. 30 through the end of the year during the 7½-year run, more than twice the increase of the next-best quarter. “You’ve got to have a reason to put money to work, and portfolio managers are sitting on what they have without taking direction,” said Tony Dwyer, co-head of U.S. equity research at Canaccord Genuity Inc. in New York. He has a target of 2,175 for the S&P 500. “You need to get changing fundamentals, some kind of oversold condition or further economic data to get anybody jumping out.” Seldom have strategists been less bullish than they are now. They’ve called for gains in the equity market 82 percent of the time during the past decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yet even amid an 18 percent recovery in the S&P 500 since its low on Feb. 11, strategists have held their target price largely unchanged. That doesn’t mean they’re bereft of optimism. A slew of upbeat revisions in recent weeks pushed their average estimate up from a low of 2,146 in August, and among the four that have made projections for next year, the average target calls for an 8.2 percent rally.

The more bullish outlooks by JPMorgan and HSBC for 2,100 and 2,000, respectively, still fall below the current level of the S&P 500. “We’re fundamentally in a very range-bound market and a little over our skis here, and that makes us vulnerable,” Ben Laidler, global equity strategist at HSBC, said in a phone interview. “Earnings remain very lackluster.” Both Laidler and JPMorgan’s Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, head of U.S. equity strategy and global quant research, cite elevated stock valuations as a reason for limiting gains through the end of the year. The gap between current and future earnings is the widest since the start of the bull market, with the S&P 500 trading at 20.3 times annual earnings, near the highest since the financial crisis.

NEW YORK — Stocks climbed Friday as banks made a rapid recovery following a steep fall a day ago. Investors hoped Deutsche Bank and the financial system in general were in better shape than they had feared. Banks made the biggest gains Friday as Germany's largest bank tried to reassure investors about its financial health. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 164.70 points, or 0.9 percent, to 18,308.15. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rebounded 17.14 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,168.27. The Nasdaq composite rose 42.85 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,312. Financial stocks tumbled Thursday afternoon following reports that some hedge funds were moving their business out of Deutsche Bank. On Friday, bank stocks and the broader market regained almost all of those losses. Nate Thooft, head of global asset allocation for Manulife Asset Management, said he does not think banks are in great danger, but he said there are causes for concern, including the health of Italy's banks. Meanwhile, with interest rates so low and regulation getting tighter, there are plenty of reasons for investors to avoid bank stocks. That didn't stop the financial sector, the weakest sector in the market this year, from rallying on Friday. Among U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase added 94 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $66.59 and Citigroup gained $1.43, or 3.1 percent, to $47.23. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 41 cents to $48.24 a barrel in New York, and it rose 8 percent over the last three days. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 18 cents to $49.06 a barrel in London. Oil prices surged this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than one-third of the world's oil, surprised investors with an agreement on a small cut in production. Investors hope energy companies will book larger profits as a result. Chevron jumped $1.65, or 1.6 percent, to $102.92 and EOG Resources rose $1.66, or 1.7 percent, to $96.71. Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale jumped $5.02, or 3.4 percent, to $152.51 after it reported a profit that was larger than analysts expected. Companies that make and sell household necessities also climbed. Procter & Gamble gained $1.52, or 1.7 percent, to $89.75 and Wal-Mart rose $1.39, or 2 percent, to $72.12. Cognizant Technology Solutions tumbled after the information technology consulting and outsourcing firm said it's investigating possible bribes paid to officials in India. Cognizant said it's looking into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and has informed the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant also said its president Gordon Coburn resigned. The stock fell $7.37, or 13.4 percent, to $47.63. Major stock indexes set records this quarter thanks mostly to tech stocks. The S&P 500 technology index climbed 12 percent over the last three months. Apple, the most valuable company in the S&P 500, surged 18 percent, partly on indications of strong sales for the newest iPhones. Microsoft, the next-largest company, rose 13 percent and another tech giant, Google parent Alphabet, leaped 14 percent. Bond prices sank. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.60 percent from 1.56 percent. More Business Cozy retirement?

More than 60 million millennials — about 80% of the generation — will become parents in the next decade, according to a study by marketing platform Crowdtap. Millennials currently spend $170 billion a year and are projected to spend $200 billion annually starting in 2017 and $10 trillion in their lifetimes, according to a study by Exponential. Millennials are becoming parents — they're just doing it later than previous generations.   This chart using Wells Fargo data shows how the average age of first marriage and childbirth is rising in the US.  View photos december 22 cotd 2015More (Business Insider/Wells Fargo) Once people have kids, they usually trade in happy hours and vacations for houses and cars.  This chart by JPMorgan shows that millennial spending is fairly similar to older generations. As they increasingly become parents, spending on categories like home improvement are expected to rise.  View photos millennial spending chartMore (JPMorgan) Shifting attitudes toward lodging and transportation Millennials have long said in surveys that they want to own homes like their parents, as Business Insider's Bob Bryan recently reported. Even those living in their parents' basements have expressed their intent to get their own place. KB Homes CEO Jeffrey Mezger said in a recent earnings call that first-time home buyers and young people are beginning to enter the market, driving demand to his business.  Millennials are also buying more cars.  The largest generation in the US bought 4 million cars and trucks last year, according to the Associated Press. Their share of the new-car market was at a record 28%.  New winners in the fast-food industry Their habits as parents are also influencing the restaurant and fast-food industries.  Traditional fast-food chains are losing market share to up-and-coming establishments like Panera Bread as millennial customers search for healthier options.   This shift in consumer mindsets puts Starbucks in a unique position to take over, according to a 2015 report by Goldman Sachs. "Starbucks is virtually the only large incumbent that can offer millennial parents the convenience of a (fast-food chain) and food they would not feel guilty/embarrassed to feed to their kids," Goldman Sachs' analysts write. View photos A McDonald's 10 piece chicken McNuggets is photographed at the Times Square location in New York March 4, 2015. REUTERS/Shannon StapletonMore (McDonald's recently retooled its McNuggets recipe to eliminate preservatives.Thomson Reuters) Starbucks has been expanding its menu to include more food options such as sandwiches and salads. It has also added drive-thrus to many locations.  The coffee chain has also been "steadily expanding kid-friendly snack options, such as organic fruit squeezes, organic food snacks, and organic Greek yogurt," according to Goldman Sachs.  Read More But McDonald's, Chick-fil-A, Wendy's, and others are trying to catch up by eliminating preservatives in food and offering more healthy and organic options.   Grocery stores make a change  Companies like Target, Walmart, and Kroger are making changes to appeal to millennial moms, who tend to do most of the shopping for their households. Target's CEO has been traveling around the country visiting the homes of millennial moms to better understand how they shop. Walmart and Kroger have been offering wider selections of organic foods, which are important to the health-conscious generation. Kroger has also been expanding its private-label products so it can offer cheaper prices.  Whole Foods is opening a new chain of stores to better appeal to millennial moms, who crave convenience and well-organized aisles.  The company's new 365 stores will be much smaller than regular stores, offer lower prices, and cater to more technology-savvy consumers. View photos 365More (Reuters) Traditional apparel chains struggle, athletic retailers win "The fashion industry has undergone one of the most dramatic makeovers in recent history — no doubt influenced by the millennial consumer," said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at NPD.  While US consumers spent slightly more on apparel, footwear, and accessories in 2014, those increases were driven by the new "athleisure" trend, not by traditional retailers like Macy's, NPD says.  While previous generations dressed up for work and play, millennials have a tendency to wear brands like Nike, Under Armour, and Lululemon everywhere, according to NPD.  "There is an underlying sense of rebellion that comes through in today’s fashion," Cohen said.  While department and discount stores struggle, business for athletic retailers is booming. Cohen says that traditional retailers will have to evolve to newly casual consumers.  "This is no longer a trend — it is now a lifestyle that is too comfortable, for consumers of all ages, for it to go away anytime soon," he said.  It's likely millennials will pass their fashion preferences on to their children too.  Hayley Peterson contributed to this story.  NOW WATCH: What this symbol that’s on nearly half of your food actually means More From Business Insider What it’s like to eat at the McDonald’s of the Philippines that people wait in 8-hour long lines to try Starbucks is testing an entirely new way to bring you your iced latte A Trump presidency holds a terrifying risk for restaurants and retailers Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to read next Ex-Goldman director Gupta seeks reversal in insider trading case | Reuters Firstpost Contenders for key jobs in Trump administration The Hindu Friday Flashback: "Wouldn't marry Anil Kapoor, he is hypersensitive": Madhuri's 1989 Interview is entertaining!

Quotes in the article JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▼ 77.58 -0.44 -0.56% The better comparison for a worst-case scenario is probably Bear Stearns. The two stories, both at the crux of the 2008 financial crisis, are important to understanding why the market tends to freak out every time a big bank hits rough waters. Bear Stearns was the story of a bank that had suffered a crisis in confidence, leading it to be shunned by hedge funds, and which saw JPMorgan Chase (JPM) swallow up the investment bank in a deal that's still controversial. Lehman, conversely, was a firm that not only had seen confidence evaporate but also had core solvency problems that made a rescue, at the time at least, impossible. Deutsche is not insolvent or even close. Though it is heavily in debt compared with its equity position, for the bank to go under it would take a cataclysmic series of events, not the least of which being a decision by European banking authorities to simply wash their hands and let the continent's biggest bank fail. That doesn't mean, though, that Deutsche is out of the woods completely or that its troubles still can't have market-shaking impacts. Friday's relief rally put the market at ease for the moment, but there remain mountainous challenges ahead.© Provided by CNBC At the core of this week's investor angst is a word that came up during Bear's demise — "novation," or a request by hedge funds that deal with the bank to have others take their place in derivatives trades. In the case of Bear Stearns, word in March 2008 that Goldman Sachs had refused a novation request spread panic through Wall Street. A few days later, the erstwhile Wall Street institution was no more. Though Bear was loaded with toxic assets, it was essentially a rapid crisis of confidence that had done in the firm. That's why Thursday's news that a couple hedge funds doing business with Deutsche were trimming their sales caused such a ruckus in the market. A Bloomberg report indicated that threehedge funds that do business with Deutsche were trimming their positions, causing afternoon market hyperventilation that the funds were losing confidence in the bank. Buzz quickly flew around a nervous Street that more troubles could be ahead. "Once investors question their confidence in a financial institution, they've already lost their confidence in it," one Wall Streeter emailed me. "This gets worse before it gets better." There also was another element to the blood-in-the-water nature of the Deutsche story. A former Deutsche Bank trader, in a conversation earlier this week, used the word "arrogance" to describe why the bank had found itself in trouble. (This person also cited negative interest rates and a looming U.S. Justice Department settlement.) There also was a joke circling around social media: "What's the Greek word for 'schadenfreude'?" The latter reference is an allusion to the heavy-handed approach Germany took toward bailing out Greece during the latter's sovereign debt crisis, contrasted against a German bank's possible need now for a bailout that would be engineered by European Union authorities. (Schadenfreude, of course, is the German term for the delight some take in watching others fail.) When Bear Stearns began its rapid and precipitous decline, speculation swirled that one of the reasons there were so few banks willing to lend a hand was because Bear itself had opted not to participate in the 1998 Long Term Capital Management bailout. Schadenfreude? Perhaps. But comparing one crisis to another is often futile, particularly in the financial industry. While they all involve debt to some extent, each has its own causes and solutions. In the case of Deutsche, what stands out most is the abundance of escape valves and backstops a troubled bank has these days. A repeat of either the Bear or Lehman situations is unlikely. That doesn't mean, though, that there still won't be difficult times ahead.

(7-14-16) TidewaterBiz Magazine cover profile. Anne Conner is the first board chairwoman of the Mariners' Museum and is an executive with TowneBank. She lives in Seaford. Photos of her in front of the Mariners' Museum in Newport News. (7-14-16) (Joe Fudge / Daily Press) Tara BozickContact Reportertbozick@dailypress.com Privacy Policy When Anne Conner commits to a project or organization, she's all in. "It's just in me," the Seaford native and resident said. "I am blessed with a lot of energy. It's probably why I keep my plate so full all the time. I don't like to sit still. I am never bored." That all-in attitude was why past Mariners' Museum board leaders John Lawson and Alan Diamonstein asked the TowneBank executive to join the Mariners' Museum board back in 2008. Conner intended to decline because of other nonprofit commitments, but she found she had a hard time turning the two men down when they sent a letter thanking her for accepting the role. In January, she became The Mariners' Museum's first board chairwoman in its more than 80-year history. As someone who is passionate about empowering women, Conner thought that a woman finally getting into that position of leadership was pretty awesome for the community. "People want to follow her, and that makes her very effective," Lawson said, who has worked in various capacities with Conner through board service. Conner brings an open mind, a great contact list and experience in finance, Lawson said, adding one of the most important committees in any organization is the finance committee. Plus, the current Mariners' Museum board member said Conner dives deep into an organization to get good feedback from the bottom. Hampton Roads jobless number remains flat from July to August Tara Bozick Williamsburg was the only greater Peninsula locality to see an improvement in its unemployment rate from July to August, according to the latest Virginia Employment Commission numbers.

Williamsburg was the only greater Peninsula locality to see an improvement in its unemployment rate from July to August, according to the latest Virginia Employment Commission numbers. The Hampton Roads unemployment rate ticked up from 4.6 percent in July to 4.7 percent in August, according to... (Tara Bozick) At the museum, she led a strategic planning process for a year and headed the search for a new museum president after Elliott Gruber stepped down at the end of April. Howard H. Hoege III was named the president and CEO in September, Conner said, after serving as a consultant for the strategic planning and then as the interim CEO. "Her enthusiasm and energy are infectious, and you can really see that reflected in the culture of our museum," Hoege said. "Anne has this excellent blend of a strong vision of excellence for the museum, high expectations that we execute well against that vision and a deep commitment to and real affection for the staff and volunteers — the people — that make our team go." Before Conner joined the board in late 2008, she hadn't been intimately familiar with the museum, but as a daughter and granddaughter of a waterman, she said her life has been tied to the Chesapeake Bay. She joined the board right when the Great Recession was taking hold, just as the stock market hit its low point in March 2009, taking the museum's endowment with it. But the banker who'd spent a career serving nonprofit clients with Bank of America wasn't deterred and became one of the museum's biggest advocates. And fortunately, the economy and endowment recovered. Struggles Like every museum, The Mariners' Museum is facing new challenges to remain relevant and re-energize itself in the modern era. Conner envisions the museum capitalizing on its comprehensive and unrivaled maritime collections by making it easier for researchers, scholars and students to access the images, documents and objects. "We must ensure the next 80 years in the museum's life," Conner said. Raising awareness about the international scope of the museum and finding advocates in folks with a passion for maritime history could help increase donations, including gifts or artifacts to the museum, she added. The museum is strategizing on how best to renovate to put more of its 32,000-object collection on display since only a small percentage is currently out. The Monitor Center holds more than 200 tons of artifacts from the Civil War ironclad, and Conner would like to see what other roles the center might have in conservation and preservation. Conner also wants to get the word out to folks on how they can access digitized images, documents and maps from the museum's library collection online. The collection totals more than 1.75 million items, including rare books and manuscripts. "The collection at the museum is second to none in the Western Hemisphere," Conner said. "It's an amazing place." When J.P. Morgan Chase representatives came for a tour, Conner showed off the museum's videoconferencing studio classrooms that allow staff to teach from the museum and reach classrooms across the country. Collections staff explained how the museum loans out objects, including rare paintings, to other museums all over the world. "I just want people to understand what an extraordinary treasure we have in The Mariners' Museum, not only in Hampton Roads, but far beyond," Conner said. "Our collection is not Hampton Roads-based waterways. Our collection is international in scope." So what does Conner bring to the table in helping the museum accomplish all these goals? "I'm a great cheerleader. I think I'm a great motivator. I think people can feel good when they link arms with me and we accomplish something together," Conner said. 'Insightful executive' After two years at Virginia Commonwealth University, a 19-year-old Conner fell in love with the service aspect of banking when she took a job as a new accounts representative at Sovran Bank, a predecessor to Bank of America. In fact, she kept working and didn't return to college. But her bank's area manager, Mel Causey, saw potential in her and encouraged her to get her degree to further her career, she said about her "first real mentor." She continued working part-time while earning her bachelor's degree in finance from what is now Christopher Newport University. She kept advancing at Bank of America, eventually becoming a senior vice president, and found her niche with nonprofit clients, growing that portfolio more than tenfold from 1995 to 2004. Having been CNU's banker, Conner caught the eye of Paul Trible, who had a vision for a new CNU. The CNU president said he asked then-Gov. Mark Warner to appoint Conner to a four-year term on the CNU Board of Visitors, which he did in 2003. Trible convinced Conner to lead CNU's real estate foundation, heading up a strategic planning process and executing a restructuring of its debt portfolio to enhance its ability to redevelop the area around the campus. She also served on the educational foundation board. Conner, along with her beloved mentor the late Walter Segaloff — the visionary behind An Achievable Dream schools, helped the foundation assemble 42 properties along the Warwick Boulevard campus over a number of years. Conner was instrumental in packaging the initial financing for the acquisition and construction of those properties that give us the CNU we see today, Trible said. "She is an insightful executive who can see beyond the numbers to arrive at creative solutions in a very complex situation," Trible said. And while she's determined and disciplined, she's also just a lot of fun, Trible said, adding, "She's full of life and energy and spirit. She loves life and makes the most of every day." Soon enough, a growing TowneBank decided it needed Conner to expand into Williamsburg. In 2005, she became the first female regional president for TowneBank. TowneBank's Williamsburg headquarters opened in 2006, and under Conner's leadership, moved from No. 7 to No. 2 in deposit market share. "She attacks projects with such vigor and enthusiasm," said J. Morgan Davis, TowneBank's president and chief banking officer and Conner's boss. In 2013, TowneBank wanted to make use of Conner's experience with nonprofit lending and tapped her to lead a new public finance and community investment division, covering TowneBank's footprint from Richmond to the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Conner deals with a complicated lending program that includes tax-exempt bond financing and making equity investments in commercial real estate projects that produce federal tax credits. The redevelopment of Whittaker Memorial Hospital in downtown Newport News is an example of the type of project that could benefit from the program. It's in this type of community impact — providing financing for affordable homes, municipal buildings such as schools or the new Princess Anne YMCA — that Conner loves, she says, because it improves the quality of life in the community. Because of Conner's work, Davis said, that portfolio accounts for a quarter of a billion dollars in loans at the bank. "She's taken something and built it into an empire," Davis said. "Anne is formidable, she really is. She radiates positive energy." In her 11 1/2 years at TowneBank, Davis said Conner has not only made the bank stronger on the Peninsula, but has polished the company's brand. Her involvement on boards, her commitment to nonprofits and the generosity of her time and energy all represent TowneBank in a positive way, Davis said. "She's a dynamo," Davis said. As vice chairwoman of the WHRO board, Conner works late nights and will go on air to help raise money during the capital campaign, said WHRO President and CEO Bert Schmidt, who considers Conner a friend. "Anne is one of my favorite people," Schmidt said, calling her a "big advocate." Small businesses Conner still makes time to devote to the startup scene in Hampton Roads. She's chairwoman of the board of ivWatch in Hampton, and has helped raise more than $20 million in equity for the new medical device firm since 2010. She's a founding board member of 757 Angels, which was established in late 2014 as a mechanism to match investors with high-potential startups in Hampton Roads to help diversify the local economy. The group has invested nearly $10 million in local small businesses so far. Conner has brought a number of companies to the attention of the angel investors and is always willing to step up and help, said Paul Hirschbiel, 757 Angels board chairman. "Clearly, her business acumen is stellar," Hirschbiel said. "As we vet companies, she is just remarkably able to weed through all the material we get and really focus in on the important ingredients." For folks looking to get involved, she said what's led to her success is doing her best to do what she says she's going to do, demonstrating integrity and being as caring as she can be. "I believe in good karma, I absolutely do," Conner said. "And if you put that out as much as you can, then it's going to come back to you." Bozick can be reached by phone at 757-247-4741.

"A heart of gold," she said, adding she's been blessed to be mentored by genuinely authentic deeply caring people. Combine that loving nature with savvy and intellect and that is the very definition of leadership, she added. "It means you have the trust and respect of your peers and really the greater community," Conner said. How others think Anne Conner is a leader: Paul Hirschbiel, board chairman of 757 Angels: "Anne listens well. She's not one to strike out when a question may arise. She's going to listen to the arguments people bring forward, and No. 2, her ego doesn't get in the way of her decision-making, which I think is really important for a leader." Bert Schmidt, president and CEO of WHRO: "She's just really one of those good people in our community who puts the community first." Paul Trible, president of Christopher Newport University: "She really possesses a passion for making the world a better place. Christopher Newport University is all about leadership, honor and service and those are virtues that really define Anne Conner's life." Buddy David, longtime Mariners' Museum attorney and community leader: "No one has ever turned to Anne because she was a woman. Her involvement was sought because of her passion, reliability, knowledge, and most of all, because she delivers." John Lawson II, developer and Mariners' Museum trustee: "She's smart and she gets things done and her attitude is always so positive, it's infectious. It causes people to also be enthusiastic." J. Morgan Davis, TowneBank's president and chief banking officer and Conner's boss: "I think she's a good leader because she's humble. She's thinking about other people contributing not what she's contributing. It's called servant leadership. You don't have the power. The people around you give you the power to lead." G. Robert Aston Jr., TowneBank chairman and CEO: "I think that Anne has a real passion for serving the community and I think that sets a standard for what she does each day."

The shares closed at €11.57, up 6.4%, the biggest gain since April. Agence France-Presse reported that the lender is nearing a settlement with the DOJ in a probe tied to residential mortgage-backed securities, citing an unidentified person familiar. Spokesmen for the Frankfurt-based lender and the DOJ declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News. Deutsche Bank’s stock and debt have been under pressure after the DOJ last month requested $14bn to settle an investigation into residential mortgage-backed securities. READ NEXT Firms lose Luas court appeal “The amount would be very good news, below what consensus expects now,” said Jerome Legras, an investor at Axiom Alternative Investments, who holds a short position on the lender. “Deutsche Bank has dropped so much as there is so much speculation circulating — at some point people just want to make a profit on short positions.” Analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co wrote in a note to clients earlier this month that a US settlement of $3bn to $3.5bn would leave the German lender room to settle other legal issues. Any additional $1bn in litigation charges would erode capital by 24 basis points. The bank’s common equity Tier 1 ratio stood at 10.8% at the end of June. In a memo to staff yesterday, chief executive John Cryan said he is taking DOJ settlements with other banks “as a benchmark”, echoing previous remarks that he expects US authorities to scale back their initial request. Ms Cryan rushed to shore up confidence in his beleaguered lender after concern some clients are reducing exposure to the company pushed the shares to record lows earlier yesterday. The bank’s balance sheet is safer than at any point in the past two decades, Mr Cryan told staff in a memo yesterday. “Trust is the foundation of banking. Some forces in the markets are currently trying to damage this trust,” he said. Analysts also came to the bank’s defence. Stuart Graham at Autonomous Research LLP wrote that Deutsche Bank has enough readily available funds on hand to weather more than two months of severe stress, including trading clients pulling back. Goldman Sachs Group analysts led by Jernej Omahen said the lender can also access backstops from the European Central Bank. “Deutsche has many problems, but liquidity is not one of them,” Mr Graham said in a note. “There can be no doubt that Deutsche could access significant additional liquidity from the ECB, should it ever need it.” Deutsche Bank has long struggled to adapt to an era of tougher capital requirements and diminished trading revenue. Mr Cryan has already said that the lender may fail to be profitable this year, calling it a peak restructuring year, as he eliminates thousands of jobs and cuts risky assets.
