Now, the high-pressure sales scandal at Wells Fargo & Co provides more evidence that large U.S. banks may have little to show for the effort. Bank consultants say tens of millions of dollars are spent each year on initiatives to build a culture of integrity, partly at the urging of regulators such as the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Octavio Marenzi, co-founder of Opimas, a management consultant that focuses on the finance industry, said banks have spent a lot of money researching their culture and updating ethics handbooks - with little impact. "A lot of what the banks are doing are superficial attempts," said Marenzi. "It's more window-dressing than anything else." The continuing spate of scandals reinforces doubts about the effectiveness of such efforts. Wells Fargo's debacle - involving the creation of as many as 2 million accounts without customers' permission - is only the latest black eye for bankers. Other recent lapses have included widespread rigging of benchmark interest rates by traders at several banks; reports that JPMorgan Chase & Co hired children of high-ranking Chinese officials to curry favor; and allegations in a London court that Goldman Sachs Group Inc bankers hired prostitutes for officials at Libya's sovereign wealth fund to win business. Wells has also previously faced accusations of discriminatory mortgage lending practices from local and federal authorities. Wells, which has denied the accusations, reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2012. A FEW BAD APPLES? Earlier this month, Wells reached a $185 million settlement with the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Los Angeles City Attorney over abusive sales tactics involved in the creation of bogus customer accounts. In a statement, Wells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk said the bank takes responsibility for customers receiving products they did not request. "Wells Fargo's culture is committed to the best interests of our customers, providing them with only the products they want and value," Folk wrote. Workers have described a pressure-cooker atmosphere where they risked losing their jobs if they did not hit unrealistic sales targets. They say this pressure defined working for Wells Fargo and directly led to widespread fraud in the opening of bogus accounts. Wells Fargo officials have countered that problems were isolated to a relatively small number of workers. Lawmakers who questioned Wells Fargo Chief Executive John Stumpf at a heated Senate Banking Committee hearing last week were unmoved by this explanation, particularly in light of the bank's firing of 5,300 workers over what it described as improper sales. "Is it normal for 1 percent of a business unit to be fired over fraud?" Republican Sen. David Vitter asked. Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley later asked a panel of government officials who regulate Wells Fargo or were involved in the settlement why Stumpf attributed the problem to rogue individuals rather than a pervasive culture or structural incentives installed by bank executives. "It's inconsistent with our findings," responded Thomas Curry, U.S. comptroller of the currency. On Tuesday evening, independent directors on the bank's board said they would pursue their own investigation and claw back $41 million worth of previously granted stock awards from Chairman and Chief Executive John Stumpf, who would also forego his salary as the directors' probe continued. In a statement, Lead Independent Director Stephen Sanger said directors would "take all appropriate actions to reinforce the right culture and ensure that lessons are learned, misconduct is addressed, and systems and processes are improved." REDOUBLED EFFORTS Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman has said that a creating a culture of integrity is among his top priorities. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in the bank's 2014 annual report that his firm needed to "redouble" efforts to reform its culture after making "a number of mistakes - some of them quite painful and costly - over the last several years." The mistakes included a $13 billion deal with the U.S. government to settle allegations of overstating the quality of bad mortgages to investors. Since then, JPMorgan launched an examination of its culture that included interviews between senior executives and over 16,000 employees. Citigroup Inc also recently launched an internal video series in which senior executives discuss how they handled business decisions in grey areas of ethics. The bank also lets employees know when colleagues are dismissed for inappropriate conduct, such as in 2014 when it dismissed 12 employees after finding fraudulent loans in Mexico. This was communicated to the firm in a memo from CEO Michael Corbat. For the first time this year, Morgan Stanley will ask risk and compliance officers to evaluate so-called "material risk-takers," such as bankers and traders. This feedback will play a factor in promotion and compensation decisions. European bank executives are also focused on promoting a culture of honesty. Deutsche Bank AG CEO John Cryan has spoken publicly about the German lender's need to change, while former Barclays PLC CEO Antony Jenkins was so focused on improving the British bank's culture that some employees dubbed him St. Antony. The banks declined to comment for this story. MEASURING CHANGE As they have embarked on these cultural-change campaigns, banks have struggled with how to measure progress. Bankers who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity mostly acknowledged their institutions have more work to do. Some have started running employee opinion surveys with questions such as, "What makes you proud to come to work?" and "What impedes the way you do business?" Personality tests can also examine how employees think about risk and how their personal values affect business decisions, said Ernst and Young's Clive Martin, who works with banks on culture issues. Banks are also looking for signs that an employee might engage in bad behavior. For example, if a trader who frequently hits risk limits, misses compliance training, or doesn't take a mandatory two week holiday that is imposed to catch fraud, it could be a red flag, consultants and bank lawyers say. The New York Fed, which has held symposiums on changing the culture of Wall Street, has suggested creating a database of bank employees who were dismissed for bad behavior. Even with all these methods and tactics, some experts see little fundamental improvement. "You can tell banks to be good, and the Fed tries hard - it holds gatherings and seminars, gets us academics in and we talk about stuff," said Shivaram Rajgopal, a professor at Columbia Business School who has researched corporate culture. "The less cynical perspective is, maybe it's hard to move the needle."

Friday 18 November 2016 Home Trade News Trade News Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Media & Promotion Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Lifestyle Analysis, Interviews, Opinions Miscellaneous Other Sectors Business Directory Contact Advertise Newsletter Premium Content Home   » Analysis, Interviews, Opinions   » MONEY MATTERS Wells Fargo scam triggers debate on big bank culture WASHINGTON, September 28, 2016 In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the banking industry sought to address an ethics crisis with surveys, town hall meetings, appointments of overseers and mechanisms for employees to report malfeasance. Now, the high-pressure sales scandal at Wells Fargo & Co provides more evidence that large US banks may have little to show for the effort. Bank consultants say tens of millions of dollars are spent each year on initiatives to build a culture of integrity, partly at the urging of regulators such as the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Octavio Marenzi, co-founder of Opimas, a management consultant that focuses on the finance industry, said banks have spent a lot of money researching their culture and updating ethics handbooks - with little impact. "A lot of what the banks are doing are superficial attempts," said Marenzi. "It's more window-dressing than anything else." The continuing spate of scandals reinforces doubts about the effectiveness of such efforts. Wells Fargo's debacle - involving the creation of as many as 2 million accounts without customers' permission - is only the latest black eye for bankers. Other recent lapses have included widespread rigging of benchmark interest rates by traders at several banks; reports that JPMorgan Chase & Co hired children of high-ranking Chinese officials to curry favor; and allegations in a London court that Goldman Sachs Group Inc bankers hired prostitutes for officials at Libya's sovereign wealth fund to win business. Wells has also previously faced accusations of discriminatory mortgage lending practices from local and federal authorities. Wells, which has denied the accusations, reached a settlement with the US Department of Justice in 2012. A FEW BAD APPLES? Earlier this month, Wells reached a $185 million settlement with the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Los Angeles City Attorney over abusive sales tactics involved in the creation of bogus customer accounts. In a statement, Wells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk said the bank takes responsibility for customers receiving products they did not request. "Wells Fargo's culture is committed to the best interests of our customers, providing them with only the products they want and value," Folk wrote. Workers have described a pressure-cooker atmosphere where they risked losing their jobs if they did not hit unrealistic sales targets. They say this pressure defined working for Wells Fargo and directly led to widespread fraud in the opening of bogus accounts. Wells Fargo officials have countered that problems were isolated to a relatively small number of workers. Lawmakers who questioned Wells Fargo chief executive John Stumpf at a heated Senate Banking Committee hearing last week were unmoved by this explanation, particularly in light of the bank's firing of 5,300 workers over what it described as improper sales. "Is it normal for one per cent of a business unit to be fired over fraud?" Republican Senator David Vitter asked. Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley later asked a panel of government officials who regulate Wells Fargo or were involved in the settlement why Stumpf attributed the problem to rogue individuals rather than a pervasive culture or structural incentives installed by bank executives. "It's inconsistent with our findings," responded Thomas Curry, US comptroller of the currency. On Tuesday evening, independent directors on the bank's board said they would pursue their own investigation and claw back $41 million worth of previously granted stock awards from chairman and chief executive John Stumpf, who would also forego his salary as the directors' probe continued. In a statement, Lead independent director Stephen Sanger said directors would "take all appropriate actions to reinforce the right culture and ensure that lessons are learned, misconduct is addressed, and systems and processes are improved." Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman has said that creating a culture of integrity is among his top priorities. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in the bank's 2014 annual report that his firm needed to "redouble" efforts to reform its culture after making "a number of mistakes - some of them quite painful and costly - over the last several years." The mistakes included a $13 billion deal with the US government to settle allegations of overstating the quality of bad mortgages to investors. Since then, JPMorgan launched an examination of its culture that included interviews between senior executives and over 16,000 employees. Citigroup Inc also recently launched an internal video series in which senior executives discuss how they handled business decisions in grey areas of ethics. The bank also lets employees know when colleagues are dismissed for inappropriate conduct, such as in 2014 when it dismissed 12 employees after finding fraudulent loans in Mexico. This was communicated to the firm in a memo from CEO Michael Corbat. For the first time this year, Morgan Stanley will ask risk and compliance officers to evaluate so-called "material risk-takers," such as bankers and traders. This feedback will play a factor in promotion and compensation decisions. European bank executives are also focused on promoting a culture of honesty. Deutsche Bank AG chief executive John Cryan has spoken publicly about the German lender's need to change, while former Barclays chief executive Antony Jenkins was so focused on improving the British bank's culture that some employees dubbed him St. Antony. As they have embarked on these cultural-change campaigns, banks have struggled with how to measure progress. Bankers who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity mostly acknowledged their institutions have more work to do. Some have started running employee opinion surveys with questions such as, "What makes you proud to come to work?" and "What impedes the way you do business?" Personality tests can also examine how employees think about risk and how their personal values affect business decisions, said Ernst and Young's Clive Martin, who works with banks on culture issues. Banks are also looking for signs that an employee might engage in bad behavior. For example, if a trader who frequently hits risk limits, misses compliance training, or doesn't take a mandatory two week holiday that is imposed to catch fraud, it could be a red flag, consultants and bank lawyers say. The New York Fed, which has held symposiums on changing the culture of Wall Street, has suggested creating a database of bank employees who were dismissed for bad behaviour. Even with all these methods and tactics, some experts see little fundamental improvement. "You can tell banks to be good, and the Fed tries hard - it holds gatherings and seminars, gets us academics in and we talk about stuff," said Shivaram Rajgopal, a professor at Columbia Business School who has researched corporate culture. "The less cynical perspective is, maybe it's hard to move the needle," he added.-Reuters Tags: Debate | Wells Fargo | More Analysis, Interviews, Opinions Stories Digital transformation – Ocean of a difference Mena M&A deals fall 24 per cent in third quarter 5G subscriptions to reach half a billion in 2022 Turning data chaos into value via digital change UAE Bankruptcy Law a 'life support' for businesses GCC can become 'world’s major e-commerce market' Crystal-gazing consumer spending in Saudi Arabia Trump has opportunity to advance growth policies 5G set to be a game-changer for networked society Demonetisation 'could add $18bn to Indian banking system' UAE employees look for flexible working hours Waste generated in GCC to hit 120m tonnes a year Global IoT market likely to top $7 trillion by 2020 Customer analytics key retail growth says report Global inflation about to spike: Saxo Bank Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

Part 7 The Half Billion Dollar GlitchSee all (7)⟶ The Penny Stock Chronicles Part 7 Knight Capital made headlines around the world when one of its computers went on a shopping spree that ended up costing the company $440 million. So surely its secrets would come out now.˅ Expand All Parts Share the whole series f t ✉ Part 1 The Money Is Gone Part 2 Big Players, Little Stocks, and Naked Shorts Part 3 Naked Shorts Can’t Stay Naked Forever Part 4 Calling the SEC Part 5 Turning Up Like a Bad Penny Part 6 Were Paper Losses the Goal All Along? Part 7 The Half Billion Dollar Glitch On August 1, 2012, the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened the day at 13,007.47. Business headlines that morning included conservative opponents of gay marriage celebrating “Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day,” the continued reluctance of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to offer debt relief to their borrowers, and profit declines at the video game company Electronic Arts. And then the Glitch happened. Knight Capital, the company Chris DiIorio had insisted to the SEC for a year was engaged in a monumental fraud, opened the day by inadvertently buying millions of shares in 154 different stocks. The company blamed an untested software installation that triggered the rapid-fire trades. In an environment where milliseconds can mean millions, it took Knight Capital 45 minutes to turn the software off. Stock values surged from the high demand, and when Knight sold back the shares it had bought by mistake, it was left with a net loss of around $468 million. The New York Stock Exchange canceled trades in six of the 154 stocks involved but deemed itself “hamstrung” by SEC rules that prevented it from breaking all of them. Knight could have used the assets on its balance sheet to absorb the loss, but DiIorio had maintained for years that many of those assets were inflated or even fictional — ghost receivables intended to balance out the massive liabilities Knight had accrued by selling stocks it didn’t really have. And DiIorio alleged that Knight’s immediate efforts to raise the full amount of its Glitch losses, instead of offsetting them with existing assets, proved that something was amiss on its balance sheet. Jason Blatt of Knight Capital Americas reacts to down market on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Aug. 8, 2011. Photo: Stan Honda/Getty Images In one of those attempts, Knight sent 7,000 securities to JPMorgan Chase as collateral for a tri-party loan, but the Wall Street Journal reported that JPMorgan deemed 4,000 of them “unreadable through databases used to reach valuations,” and refused to accept them. DiIorio saw this as consistent with shares in companies whose CUSIP, or unique identifying symbol, had changed after a reverse merger or split — just what he had been warning about for years. Such stocks would be unredeemable for any real value. “Those were the stocks that no longer traded!” DiIorio says. “They were pledging worthless collateral.” The proposed loan collapsed. The funding Knight did receive, from a consortium of investors that took 73 percent of the company without a shareholder proxy vote, was not collateral-based. In late 2012, Knight announced a merger with rival market maker Getco. DiIorio filed a new “tip, complaint or referral” form to the SEC — this one vetted by the law firm Berger & Montague — highlighting Knight’s post-Glitch funding issues and how they pointed to evidence of a naked short selling scheme. DiIorio’s “findings — the product of thousands of hours of careful study — can protect others from falling victim to these same frauds,” the TCR concluded. Berger & Montague eventually parted ways with DiIorio. The lead attorney on the complaint, Daniel Miller, did not respond to requests for comment. The SEC did not respond to the new TCR, nor did it prevent the Knight/Getco merger. It did fine Knight Capital $12 million related to violations of the market access rule when it committed the Glitch. But compared to DiIorio’s claims, that was miniscule. DiIorio even tried to collect a whistleblower award for a 2011 enforcement against UBS for violations of Regulation SHO. He wanted to force the SEC to look at his claims again, and hopefully open a new investigation. The SEC denied DiIorio’s application to collect the award. While he is not privy to undisclosed SEC investigations, DiIorio does not believe the agency has investigated Knight’s or UBS’s involvement in penny stocks. DiIorio thinks the agency could audit Knight’s profit and loss statements to understand its concentration in penny stocks. Or officials could deny the numerous penny stock reverse mergers and reverse splits that DiIorio says drive the scheme. Or they could investigate why the splits proliferate. SEC spokesperson Ryan White declined to comment. SEC Chief of the Office of the Whistleblower Sean McKessy and Chief of Enforcement Andrew Ceresney did not respond to requests for comment. The agency did recently tout its whistleblower program as “a gamechanger … in its short time in existence.” In July, McKessy announced his exit from the agency after five years running the Office of the Whistleblower. In September, he became a partner at the law firm Phillips & Cohen, which has won for clients one-third of the total whistleblower awards granted by the SEC. Meanwhile, the Justice Department is reportedly investigating Knight, now known after the merger as KCG, over allegedly executing stock trades to shortchange its clients. KCG’s most recent quarterly report acknowledges that “the Company is currently the subject of various regulatory reviews and investigations,” including by the SEC and the Justice Department. But there’s been no public acknowledgment of any investigation into penny stock activity. KCG declined to comment, through its spokesperson Sophie Sohn. UBS only responded to multiple requests by saying, “UBS applies strict due diligence and anti-money-laundering standards to all its business.” Knight’s own trading data confirms that it never stopped selling penny stocks. It boasted in its 2013 annual report of being “the clear market leader in over-the-counter (OTC) traded stocks.” And it increased its volume  in 2014, trading 19.1 billion shares of OTC and Pink Sheet stocks per day in February of that year, up from a little over 4 billion a day in the previous quarter. While those volumes have lessened somewhat, to this day between 73 and 80 percent of Knight’s share volumes are in OTC and Pink Sheet stocks. “The activity continues today and the investing public remains at risk,” DiIorio says. DiIorio is highly skeptical of the SEC’s intentions at this point. He believes the agency has all the information it needs to move on the scheme. But prosecuting Knight and UBS would raise questions about the SEC’s silence before and during the Glitch, and its decision to dismiss criminal charges against UBS in 2010 on the grounds that UBS had changed its ways. “How are they going to say that [UBS] did penny stock money laundering?” DiIorio asks. The charge is explosive. It’s hard for a member of the public, lacking access to the SEC’s data and analytics, to fully vet DiIorio’s claims. This rankles even securities regulators. “I have no authority to look at a reverse split unless someone alleges fraud on the markets,” said Joseph Borg, director of the Alabama Securities Commission. “Enforcement is after you burn down the forest. I can’t blow out the match because I can’t even ask what you’re doing in the forest to begin with!” Since the Bernie Madoff scandal, the SEC’s Office of the Whistleblower has professed a greater desire to fully investigate cases. Part of the post-Madoff recommendations mandated that the SEC’s Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations vet all whistleblower information. But last year, when DiIorio contacted Kevin Goodman, director of OCIE for broker-dealers, Goodman responded, “Thank you for your recent emails. I wanted to acknowledge them and let you know I have received and will consider the information you have provided.” To DiIorio, that suggested Goodman had not seen the claims before. The SEC would not make Goodman available for comment. Frustrated with the SEC, DiIorio reached out to the Financial Industry Regulatory Agency, the security industry’s self-regulatory organization. DiIorio had a two-hour conference call in August 2012 with a team leader at Finra’s whistleblower office shortly after the Glitch. He had another meeting later with FBI agents. And this April, he met with IRS officials. Chris DiIorio. Photo: Matt Slaby for The Intercept Since he first contacted Finra, the agency has issued several complaints against brokers other than Knight over failing to comply with anti-money laundering regulations. Some of them cited penny stocks DiIorio highlighted in his claims. In particular, Finra fined Brown Brothers Harriman $8 million for violating money-laundering rules by turning a blind eye to “suspicious penny stock transactions,” executed “on behalf of undisclosed customers of foreign banks in known bank secrecy havens.” But none of those foreign banks or their customers were named. “Who does that protect?” DiIorio asked. Richard Best, the lead enforcement official at Finra on the Brown Brothers Harriman case, now runs the Salt Lake City regional office for the SEC. The agency declined to make him available for comment. Five years after alerting the SEC to his allegations, DiIorio has never been brought in for a meeting. He’s going public now because he’s fed up with the inaction. “I’ve always said to the SEC, ‘I’ll be there tomorrow, I’ll come without an attorney,’” DiIorio says. “They won’t even pick up the phone.” DiIorio doesn’t do much investing anymore. But he never sold off his original investment in Best Rate Travel, now known as Yora International, which has traded at a fraction of a penny for several years. It’s still sitting in his IRA account, the shares having been reduced through more reverse splits to 3,299. Under market value, it just says, “$NP,” or “no price.” Chris DiIorio’s IRA statement.

Could the tech giant see more gains? Larry McDonald of ACG Analytics and Craig Johnson of Piper Jaffray discuss with Brian Sullivan.</p> Amazon hits record high    Tuesday, 27 Sep 2016 | 3:21 PM ET | 03:38 Amazon $1,000? Shares of the e-retailer jumped 2 percent on Tuesday after JPMorgan raised its price target to $1,000 by December 2017, up from its previous target of $925 for December 2016. "We believe Amazon continues to show strong ability to take share of overall eCommerce, and its flexibility in pushing first-party versus third-party inventory is a major advantage compared with other retailers," analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in a note published Tuesday. JPMorgan rates the company as overweight, and notes its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-computing services has proved successful. And the charts may point to the same conclusion. "The chart has been a terrific trending stock over the last several years," Craig Johnson, technical research analyst at Piper Jaffray, said Tuesday on CNBC's "Trading Nation." "And at this point in time you can see a very well-defined channel that the shares have been in," Johnson said, adding that the charts may point to a price target of $875 to $900. Larry McDonald, head of global macro at ACG Analytics, said now is not the best time to buy Amazon. The company has over the years invested "heavily" in new vehicles of revenue creation and has at times not seen its return pay off, McDonald said Tuesday on "Trading Nation." "The one consistent thing we've seen with Amazon the last 15 years, really, is they have a big capital expenditure investment cycle that repeats itself over and over again," McDonald said. But when Amazon has historically gone "out of favor" at these times, according to McDonald, that is the best opportunity to buy its shares. JPMorgan's bullish price target joins two recent calls of $1,000 or more; earlier this month, Evercore ISI raised its price target to $1,015 and RBC Capital raised its price target to $1,000. Analysts' average target price is $900.21, according to FactSet estimates. Nomura on Wednesday resumed coverage of Amazon with a buy rating and a $950 price target, citing Amazon's focus on growing Amazon Prime memberships and investment in Prime Instant Video, as well as the company's "leadership in the cloud industry via AWS." Evercore ISI analyst Ken Sena wrote in a note earlier this month that Amazon's venture into the cloud space and utilization of artificial intelligence has fueled the bullish sentiment. He reiterated the firm's buy rating. "Not only are these advancements leading to higher overall customer satisfaction as delivery of food, packages, or other is becoming faster and more reliable, but we also see where many of the automation technologies are already offering quantifiable financial benefits," including savings in areas such as labor and improved inventory turns, Sena wrote in his note entitled, "AMZN - An Automated Vision of the Future."

The company will begin to move employees out of the Chase Commerce Solutions office, formerly known as Paymentech Solutions, on Northeastern Boulevard in 2018, and the process could take up to several years, said company spokeswoman Mary Jane Rogers. She called the move "a long-term strategic decision" to consolidate operations to 19 "core, strategic" global hubs. The positions currently housed at the Salem site will be moved to Dallas; Tempe, Arizona; Tampa, Florida; and Wilmington, Delaware.  "After much deliberation and discussion and lots of people involved in orchestrating a decision, a really difficult decision was made to exit the Salem, New Hampshire site," Rogers said. "They're important jobs that will just go to other locations. And they're also complex jobs in many respects, and so moving them will not be as easy as perhaps other kinds of roles would be." The company has been in operation in Salem since 1986; it was acquired by JPMorgan Chase in the 1990s. Town Manager Leon Goodwin said the departure of the business from town is a concern for the community. "Frankly, this is the kind of thing we were trying to avoid when we adopted the innovation district last year, which was our recognition that businesses are consolidating (and) they are having difficulty attracting the type of employees they need," Goodwin said. Salem established the Business Innovation Overlay District in 2016, which allows for a mix of business, commercial, office, residential, institutional and entertainment uses in a campus setting with flexibility — granted through conditional use permits from the Planning Board — from land-use regulations governing density, setbacks, lot sizes, parking requirements and building heights. The district extends from the commercial-industrial district west of Interstate 93 in Salem and between I-93 and North and South Policy streets. The properties must have a minimum of 10 acres. The purpose of creating the district was to attract young employees to town and to create a space where people would want to live and work. "That's what we were trying to avoid, is losing out to parts of the country that have that already," Goodwin said Thursday. Commerce Solutions' chief executive announced the closure to employees at the site in a series of town halls Wednesday, Rogers said. "Once the business decision was made, we wanted to let employees know so they could make plans for themselves and their families," Rogers said. "We don't know the exact timing but we do know the jobs will begin to move in 2018 and it could take several years." The company will work with employees on an individual basis to determine where they will relocate, if they choose to. For those who choose to leave their position, Chase will offer career counseling and other services like resume workshops, as well as a severance package, Rogers said. "For those people who know moving is not an option, we'll provide careering counseling...to support successful transition, whether it's within the company or outside," Rogers said. "It's such an individual, personal decision for employees and their families." Goodwin said he plans to notify the state to "make sure those people" affected "are taken care of." "That's a problem for economic development going forward," Goodwin said of losing businesses to communities with more amenities than Salem, "and I think from my perspective this is a challenge — this is something we might see continue into the future, so we need to do all we can to stem that tide."

Women in Banking: Power, Empathy, and Courage By Tanaya Macheel September 29, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Related Q&A with Sallie Krawcheck The Circuit: The 'Daughters of Banking' Community Banker of the Year: Heritage Oaks' Simone Lagomarsino What Bankers Want (and Don't Want) from President Trump 'That's Just Really, Really Bad': Bank CEOs React to Wells Scandal Why Media Representation Matters for Women in Banking Our annual rankings are out! Don't miss this year's lists of the Most Powerful Women in Banking, the Women to Watch and the Most Powerful Women in Finance. BNY Mellon's Karen Peetz was named the Most Powerful Woman in Banking this year, while KeyCorp's Beth Mooney has graduated to Hall of Fame status. JPMorgan Chase's Mary Callahan Erdoes is the Most Powerful Woman in Finance for the fourth year in a row. Bank of the West's Nandita Bakhshi tops the Women to Watch list. She left TD Bank earlier this year to become chief executive of Bank of the West, becoming the fourth woman to head a top-40 bank. The other three are Mooney, Ally Bank's Diane Morais and CIT's Ellen Alemany, who came out of retirement almost a year ago to lead CIT Group and is now No. 2 on the Watch list. Mary Mack sits at No. 3 with a rocky road ahead of her, as she works to rebuild trust with Wells Fargo customers following Wellsgate. There are some newcomers to the honoree lists to read about too, including Mary Ann Scully of Howard Bank in Ellicott City, Md., Teresa Tanner of Fifth Third Bancorp, Rosilyn Houston of BBVA Compass, Karen Glenn of First United Bank and Trust Co. in Kentucky and Claudine Gallagher of BNP Paribas. Hall of Fame American Banker inducted Beth Mooney, chief executive of KeyCorp, into its newly created Hall of Fame for three-peat winners of the Most Powerful Woman In Banking award. Under Mooney's leadership female representation among corporate officers has grown to 25%; Key has one of the most diverse boards of directors in the industry. Mooney's stature was highlighted by Key's $4.1 billion purchase of First Niagara, the industry's second-largest acquisition by deal value since the financial crisis and throughout which the company remained committed to low- and middle-income borrowers and expanding community development lending by $4.5 billion. Mooney likes the idea of the Hall of Fame because it meshes with her philosophy of helping to make way for and elevate future female leaders, but her trailblazing days aren't over. "American Banker names a most powerful banker every year, so in my mind, I'm not out of your game yet," she said. "You should not think of me just as a woman banker. I'm a CEO in our industry whose bank is doing lots of interesting things." Profiles in Courage Empathy Matters: BBVA Compass' chief talent and culture officer, Rosilyn Houston, has spent most of her career in banking. But for a short while in 2004, she left for a brief stint at a Christian organization in Dallas, where she was general manager — a big job in which she oversaw 200 employees. That's when her almost-2-year-old son was diagnosed with leukemia. Following his illness, Houston returned to banking, joining what is now BBVA Compass as a senior vice president, accepting challenge after challenge until she got to her role today. She's responsible not for overseeing typical HR functions — like payroll and benefits — but also transforming the bank's culture. "This is a journey," Houston said. "We started a real intense focus on cultural transformation at the end of last year and we know it's going to take three to five years to get to where we are comfortable." Her empathy is essential to that job, and she's keenly aware that many employees come to work every day with their own personal struggles. Having suffered "a number of life blows" — she battled cancer herself and lost her mother to the illness — "that could have knocked me off course." Creating a workplace that is viewed as compassionate is one of her top priorities. "Part of being an effective leader is being sensitive to what individuals go through day in and day out, not only in the job, but in life." Fear of the Unknown: Some bankers are proud of making it through the financial crisis. Imagine doing that while also contending with a personal crisis. When Karen Glenn, was chief financial officer of First United Bank and Trust in Madisonville, Ky., her 5-year-old son had battled non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and she often worked from his hospital room — just as she had pulled through a separate health crisis, with his twin brother. "The way I looked at it was that my boys needed me to do this," Glenn said of her decision to keep working through Ethan's treatments, instead of taking her extended leave. "This was our life, our livelihood. I had to make it work." That was in late 2009. Six months after her son completed his cancer treatments, she was promoted to president and chief executive of First United. She hesitated at first to accept the job — at the time she lived an hour away from the bank's headquarters and the job required her to move. But since becoming CEO she has substantially improved the bank's performance, posting a record profit last year, and spearheaded its first acquisition. "I came very close to saying 'no' because of the fear of the unknown," Glenn said. It was going to change my life so much." However, "not having a career has never been an option for me," she said. Today the boys are in middle school and thriving. The Ripple Effect: JPMorgan Chase's new general counsel, Stacey Friedman, is a tough financial litigator, the only woman to serve as the general counsel of a systemically important U.S. bank and a fighter for social justice. When she became a partner at the high-powered Wall Street law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, she opted to take on a more visible role in the push for LGBT rights. At that time, she was one of 30 women, out of 172 partners, and the first to be openly gay. "You realize that it has a ripple effect," she said. (Beth Mooney said something similar at the Most Powerful Women in Banking ceremony last year.) "If people are going to laud you and notice you for it, then you should make sure you use that as a platform for change." Friedman has taken on high-profile pro bono cases in recent years, including one that successfully struck down a ban on gay adoption in Arkansas. Earlier this year, she expanded the pro bono program at JPMorgan, implementing a three- to six-month paid fellowship for attorneys to work on a legal service project. "It's undeniable that all of the things that make all of us up are obstacles or benefits along the way, and I wouldn't look at that fact of my life and assume it was never an obstacle — of course it was," Friedman said of her sexual orientation and gender. And although she has always been surrounded by supportive colleagues, she said, "that isn't the case in every corner of every financial institution or every company." The Power of Storytelling: When it comes to supporting women in banking, Barclays' vice chairman of investment banking, Barbara Byrne, wants to do more than the usual basics (like mentoring). Over the past year she has exercised her storytelling power as a producer on indie film "Equity," a Wall Street thriller that aims to flip viewers' expectations about gender and finance on their heads. The film has all female lead characters, directors, producers and financial backers. One reason "Equity" is so effective is it doesn't sugarcoat the way women treat each other; it puts women in the same cutthroat roles typically reserved for men. "This is not a sisterhood movie," she said. Known today for her outspoken style, she was shy when she took her first job at Lehman Brothers in her 20s, calling herself better suited for a library than an investment bank. "I am a forceful personality, but I did not spring from the womb that way," she said. Harvey Krueger, a longtime executive at Lehman, brought her out of her shell. She recalls a time she prepared a presentation for him to give to the board of a major company. He asked her if she thought he was capable of giving it. She said yes. "So he said, 'Well, why don't you get up there and just pretend you're me?'" Byrne said. She followed that advice over the next few years, developed her own sense of confidence and characteristic style in the process, and now passes the advice on to her employees. Role Call Bank of New York Mellon's president Peetz will retire at the end of the year. She announced her retirement the same day she was honored as American Banker's Most Powerful Woman in Banking for 2016. Peetz was also ranked No. 1 in 2011 and has been ranked among the top five in each of the last eight years. JPMorgan Chase's Thasunda Duckett has been named chief executive officer of consumer banking, as part of one of the bank's periodic management reshufflings. Duckett, one of our 25 Women to Watch this year and last, was previously CEO of the bank's auto finance arm.

Here's how much the top Wall Street banks have earned in fees this year Portia Crowe Sep. 26, 2016, 9:16 AM 17,733 facebook linkedin twitter email print JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. JPMorgan has pulled in more fees than any other investment bank this year.Reuters JPMorgan is leading the pack when it comes to Wall Street dealmaking revenues, according to Dealogic's preliminary league tables for the first nine months of the year.  Altogether, global investment banking revenue was down 14% from the same period last year. That is improvement on the first half, where revenues came in 16% lower than the previous years. League tables are a contentious subject on Wall Street. Banks use them when pitching for new business, and a good ranking means serious bragging rights. But the league table-data can also be sliced up to make a bank's performance look better (by narrowing the field very narrowly, for example).   Though they're based on estimates, these tables are the broadest possible and a closely-watched indicator of who is up and who is down.  Here's how the banks stacked up this time around. View As: One Page Slides JPMorgan ranked first for overall investment banking revenues Dealogic JPMorgan has a 8.1% market share and $4.1 billion in total revenues for the year to September 26. It was followed by rival Goldman Sachs, with $3.4 billion and a 6.8% share. Bank of America was in third place, with $3.2 billion. Global investment banking revenue was $50.7 billion for the first nine months of 2015, which was down 14% compared to the same period last year. JPMorgan also ranked first for revenue in debt capital markets Dealogic JPMorgan has made $1.1 billion in revenue in debt capital markets, giving it an 6.9% share. Bank of America followed, with $1.1 billion in fees, and Citi raked in $923 million to place third. Global DCM volumes hit the $5 trillion earlier this month, putting 2016 on track to beat the 2006 full year record high of $6.62 trillion. And in equity capital markets Dealogic JPMorgan had a 8% share in equity capital markets, followed by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Global equity capital markets volumes, at $512.7 billion, was the lowest since 2012.  Goldman Sachs was the winner for M&A revenues Dealogic Goldman Sachs is well ahead of its rivals in M&A with $1.8 billion in revenues, versus JPMorgan's $1.5 billion and Morgan Stanley's $1.3 billion. Global M&A stands $2.5 trillion, down 24% from the same period a year ago.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch scored first place in syndicated loans. Dealogic Bank of America Merrill Lynch pulled in $798 million for arranging syndicated loan deals, versus JPMorgan's $745 million and Credit Suisse's $548 million.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) Share Written by Victoria Finkle September 29, 2016 Wells Fargo was supposed to be the nice bank. For years, it’s leaned into a folksy image, presenting itself as a beacon of stability—disinclined to make waves—that avoided the worst of the behaviors that led to the mortgage meltdown. One fawning profile from early 2015 briefly compared the bank’s chief executive, John Stumpf, to Jimmy Stewart, who famously played hometown banker George Bailey in It’s a Wonderful Life. No one will be making that analogy again anytime soon. The news that Wells Fargo employees have for years been opening fake accounts on behalf of customers in order to inflate sales figures has provoked widespread fury. Thousands of employees have been fired for opening more than two million dubious accounts. The bank will also claw back millions of dollars already paid out to Stumpf and Carrie Tolstedt, the bank’s former head of retail banking. At last week’s hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, US senator Elizabeth Warren urged Stumpf to resign. Even HBO talk-show host John Oliver is wading into the fray. All of which raises the question: With scandal enveloping the last plausible “good” big bank, will Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and the other industry titans soon face another public reckoning?  Will Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and the other industry titans soon face another public reckoning? It’s easy to understand why the Wells Fargo fiasco has attracted so much public outcry. Compared to the financial crimes that have grabbed headlines over the past several years, the wrongdoing here is pretty straightforward. This isn’t a case of manipulating complicated interest rates, like the Libor issue, or even a problem of a multi-billion-dollar investment gone wrong, as seen in the London Whale debacle. There’s no talk of collateralized debt obligations or the packaging of mortgage-backed securities. Instead, Wells Fargo’s high-pressure sales quotas sent low-paid customer reps scrambling to meet unachievable growth goals. You don’t need training in finance or even a thousand-word “explainer” to understand how the incentives might go sideways on that one. The scandal doesn’t necessarily disabuse Wells Fargo of its Main Street image. The bank does concentrate most of its activity on consumer accounts, mortgages, commercial lending, and the like. But the fake-accounts scheme does show that a focus on bread-and-butter banking alone may not be enough to stem the tide of bad behavior. “If there was any perception before that these guys were flying above the fray, I think that’s been shattered,” said Jason Ware, chief investment officer and chief economist at Albion Financial Group in Salt Lake City, Utah. To be fair, there had been some troubling signs that Wells wasn’t quite living up to the down-home, aw-shucks image it sought to portray. But investors have historically flocked to the bank due to its reputation and strong earnings. The firm grew to be the world’s largest in terms of market capitalization, worth more than $300 billion at one time. Since news of the problematic accounts broke, stock prices have fallen. Stumpf’s decision to give up $41 million in unvested stock looks unlikely to appease lawmakers. There also seems to be a growing consensus among politicians and regulators that, much as big banks may try to differentiate among themselves, they all require tough oversight and a heavy dose of skepticism.  There’s an adage on the left, popularized by Warren, that “banking should be boring.” “There’s no such thing as a ‘good’ big bank after the financial crisis,” said Robert Jackson Jr., a professor of law at Columbia University. “What we have are big banks that deserve a significant amount of scrutiny in the way that they are run, and Wells Fargo, Citibank, nobody should expect to be exempted from this.” There’s an adage on the left, popularized by Warren, that “banking should be boring.” But even the self-proclaimed boring bank has shown that it will look the other way to meet the go-go expectations of the market. If boring banking isn’t enough to quash wrongdoing, expect lawmakers to demand alternatives—ones that the big banks almost certainly won’t like any better. In a campaign season where both political parties have called for breaking up the big banks, Wells Fargo’s latest misstep is bad for all of the largest institutions. Regulators have already said they’re investigating whether other banks have problems with bogus accounts. And the scandal will undoubtedly spur fresh debates in Washington about the problem of banks that are “too big to manage.” All this may well embolden big bank critics who have called for chopping them up altogether. Whether or not those threats ever come to fruition, the sloppy behavior exhibited by Wells managers has brought banking under even more political fire. For an industry in desperate need of a new public narrative, the downfall of the last “good” big bank simply underscores the stickiness of the same old story.

Authorities in Seychelles were called to the scene after a butler assigned to the villa arrived to find the sisters unresponsive on the same bed. There was no disturbance in the room, police said. While their bodies did not show any signs of trauma, certain medications were confiscated from the room by police as part of their investigation, authorities said. The Korkki sisters’ stay at the resort was originally set to end on September 22, but they had extended it to September 24. Both sisters had shared photos of their stay in Seychelles on Facebook, with many showing the resort, where an ocean panoramic villa costs upwards of £1,300 per night. In one photo on September 17 appearing to show the beautiful view from their villa, Annie wrote in the comment section calling it ‘the best place ever’. In another, Annie said their trip was ‘indescribable.’ Facebook 6 Annie (above) and her sister had shared photos of their stay in Seychelles on Facebook Facebook Maia Luxury Resort & Spa 6 ‘The best place ever’ ..the Seychelles is located more than 900 miles off Africa’s east coast Facebook 6 Annie (above) and her sister were both described as adventurous women Annie, who lived in Denver, worked at JP Morgan Chase, according to her Facebook page. Her sister Robin lived in Chicago and is the Head of FX and Metals at Allston Trading. Both are described as healthy women and experienced travelers. “The family is in shock,” brother Chris told KMSP. “Everyone is trying to understand and come to terms with what happened.” Their mother Sue and brother Mike, who both live in Colorado, are currently in Seychelles, pressing local and US officials for answers, The Star-Tribune reported. They are also making arrangements to bring the women back home, Chris told the newspaper. He also noted that at this time, his family has limited information on what led to his sisters’ deaths. “At this point, the only details we know are the articles flying around online,” he said. “My mom has been talking with people from the U.S. Embassy. I don’t think they’ve provided her with any information.” The sisters’ bodies are in a mortuary as authorities await autopsy results to determine the cause of death. Local police have been working with the American embassy in Mauritius during their investigation, according to The Seychelles Nation. The Seychelles is located more than 900 miles off Africa’s east coast and is a tourist destination with its beaches, natural reserves, warm weather and coral reefs. The Maia Luxury Resort and Spa is a twelve-acre property on the secluded Anse Louis located on the island of Mahe. The five-star hotel’s 30 suites, ten ocean-front villas and 20 panoramic villas, each offers guests private pools, a 24-hour personal butler and views of the Indian Ocean, according to its website.

Global perspective. advertisement Royal Bank of Scotland agrees to pay $1.1 billion to resolve US mortgage claims Wednesday 28 September 2016 at 2:39 PM ET by Justin Cosgrove ©  WikiMedia (Elliott Brown) [JURIST] The US National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) [official website] said [press release] Wednesday that the Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS) [corporate website] will pay $1.1 billion after it allegedly solid toxic mortgaged-backed securities. The RBS is currently preparing [Reuters report] to settle a number of other US cases dealing with mis-selling similar bonds. This comes after the 2008 financial crisis [Britannica backgrounder], in which the NCUA claim such firms "contributed to the corporate crisis." Under this settlement, the RBS does not admit fault as they currently are still facing 13 other cases for similar claims. The NCUA said that it continues to litigate against other bands for their sale of bad mortgage-backed securities to credit unions. Major banking firms have faced numerous lawsuits regarding their business practices. In December 2013 the NCUA brought a suit [JURIST report] against JPMorgan for similar RMBS products sold by Bear Stearns, which was also subsequently purchased by JPMorgan. In July 2012 JPMorgan agreed to a $100 million settlement [JURIST report] in a suit brought by customers claiming unreasonable fees and a three percent increase on monthly minimum payments by credit card holders. In early June of that year the firm was granted [JURIST report] permission to pay $44.6 million to resolve allegations of fraudulent bidding practices for state and local government investment securities at taxpayers' expense. The settlement followed JPMorgan's agreement [JURIST report] with the US Department of Justice to pay $228 million to federal and state authorities. One month earlier JPMorgan again settled [JURIST report] at $153.6 million for fraud charges brought by the SEC for misleading investors during the housing crises. In July 2010 Goldman Sachs agreed to a $550 million settlement [JURIST report] with the SEC to resolve similar charges.

THE AGENDA Reading Now: Up Next: Animation by Bewilder The Agenda Future of Money The mystery of high-frequency trading How can you put a speed limit on something you can’t track? By Zachary Warmbrodt 09/28/16 04:55 AM EDT Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Something mysterious rattled one of the world’s most stable financial markets for 12 harrowing minutes on Oct. 15, 2014. During that brief window, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note—a benchmark security critical to funding the federal government—dropped dramatically and then surged, and no one could tell why. It was, said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, “an event that is supposed to happen only once in every 3 billion years. ” Like other market surprises, including a May 2010 “flash crash” in stocks and futures, it triggered an investigation. Government agencies spent months dissecting millions of data points from the Treasury market to find out just what had happened that day. Their conclusion was unsettling: They still had no idea what had caused it. What they were able to document, however, was the rise of a new major player in Treasury notes: a group of investors using ultra-fast trading systems to make money by quickly flipping government debt. The agencies found that the firms, privately trading their own capital rather than the money of outside investors, accounted for the majority of trading in this crucial market. High-speed algorithmic trading had long been a big concern in stock markets, where sophisticated but obscure firms with lightning-fast connections to exchanges were forcing regulators to grapple with potential problems, including market volatility. What the T-note investigation found is that such traders had also made deep inroads into the globe’s premier government funding market, a safe haven for investors and a vital tool for implementing U.S. monetary policy. The findings underscored just how hard it could be to keep markets stable and fair as faster, more opaque players show up. The most aggressive algorithmic trading firms have been viewed with suspicion for years because of concerns that their business is essentially predatory, exploiting tiny technical gaps in the market to the disadvantage of other investors. Michael Lewis, the author of “Moneyball” and “The Big Short,” tackled this shadowy world in his 2014 book “Flash Boys," which demonized these high-frequency traders as predators who made money at the expense of more traditional firms, paying to access the markets faster than other investors. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on October 15, 2014 in New York City. For 12 long minutes that day, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note plunged in value and then suddenly bounced back. | Spencer Platt/Getty Though HFT might sound like an inside-baseball issue in the finance world, the debate has bubbled to the point that it has surfaced in the presidential race. Perhaps the most significant financial reform in Hillary Clinton's platform is a new tax aimed at excessive levels of certain types of stock market orders, a measure her campaign argues will help combat “harmful” high-frequency trading. The 2016 Democratic platform gives a nod to others in the party who want a broader Wall Street transaction tax, to “curb excessive speculation and high-frequency trading, which has threatened financial markets.” Clinton has also articulated a much more wide-ranging stock market overhaul to ensure “equal access to markets and information,” which insiders also see as a reference to the advantages high-frequency traders attempt to cultivate. (Donald Trump's plans are far less specific.) But as criticism focuses on the hard-to-monitor world of automated trading, questions remain—what is harmful trading and who is doing it? The traders themselves defend their work as not only legal, but helpful in keeping markets liquid. And even if we were to decide the trading is harmful, is there any way to get the horse back in the barn? PART OF THE challenge is that automated trading is everywhere now: The technology behind this new breed of trader is part of the fundamental fabric of the markets, used by a wide variety of firms and investors. The traders of most concern to regulators are the ones trying to game the complexity of the market itself for competitive advantage. Their success has been rooted in gaining the fastest conceivable connections to various markets and doing the best job of parsing vast amounts of trade data. The arms race has yielded numerous firms with different strategies, but observers now put them into a couple of separate categories. One type of firm buys and sells various products on a continuous basis, providing liquidity and quickly closing out its positions to limit ist own risk. Defenders of these "electronic market-makers" argue that they can help provide liquidity in the markets where they operate. One of these, Virtu Financial, last year became the first high-frequency trading firm to go public. This year, JPMorgan Chase agreed to a partnership in which Virtu will help the nation’s largest bank trade Treasurys. Such big players are becoming more mainstream and more accepted, even by some of the staunchest critics of high-frequency trading. “Years ago we thought high-frequency trading was one bucket, and we just put it into one bucket. We didn't really know too much about it, ” said high-frequency trading critic Joseph Saluzzi, co-founder of brokerage firm Themis Trading. “It was very vague and no one would speak about it. ” Then there are the traders you hear about when the Securities and Exchange Commission files a lawsuit against them. Take Athena Capital Research. The privately funded “global quantitative investment manager" was the target of the SEC's first high-frequency trading market manipulation case, resulting in a $1 million settlement in 2014. The agency alleged the firm used an algorithm code-named “Gravy" to artificially push market prices in its favor by making massive amounts of trades near the close of a day's trading. The SEC said the relatively small firm “dominated the market” in the last few seconds of a trading day for tens of thousands of stocks using “high-powered computers, complex algorithms, and rapid-fire trades. ” A trader sits and monitors his computer screens as he trades on the financial markets from the offices of Futex Co. in April, 2015. Futex formerly employed Navinder Singh Sarao, who the U.S. authorities claim helped cause the 2010 flash crash. | Getty Images “Those are the guys that need to be reined in, ” Saluzzi said. “Those are the ones people don't know much about. They're predatory in nature. ” Athena neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing the case. HOW DO YOU rein them in? So far, Washington has handled the issue cautiously. SEC Chair Mary Jo White has spoken of “the need to avoid undue interference with practices that benefit investors and market efficiency.” She has also outlined ways that investors “are doing better in today’s algorithmic marketplace than they did in the old manual markets” thanks in part to lower trade execution costs. Andrei Kirilenko, a former chief economist at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said in an interview that regulators need to get a better understanding of “who is out there, why are they out there, do we know what they do, if they do something wrong can we get their records? ” Former CFTC general counsel Dan Berkovitz said regulators have moved away from the question of whether the technology is inherently good or bad. Now the focus is more about ensuring a fair market structure. “The race for speed—who’s it really benefiting, and if it benefits somebody, does that mean somebody’s hurt by it?” said Berkovitz, now a partner at WilmerHale. “If people are faster and better and they’re making money off it, where does that money come from? Is somebody getting hurt by it? … I don’t think the regulators have the ability to really understand the guts of these things. And so they’re worried it’s going to get out of control.” Rather than trying to roll back the clock of technology, agencies overseeing U.S. markets have moved to require algorithmic traders, and the people who design their trading systems, to register with regulators. “Some of the biggest traders in our markets are not currently subject to our oversight, and we need a way to make sure they are following reasonable risk controls,” CFTC Chairman Timothy Massad said in a Sept. 27 speech. “And, in fact, some of those traders have supported a registration requirement.” The CFTC, which oversees the futures market, has drafted a controversial proposal that would go further, extending its record-keeping requirements to the source code underlying automated trading systems. The rule, which has yet to be finalized, would require algorithmic traders to maintain repositories that would track changes to their code, which could then be made available to investigators in the event something went wrong in the markets. Industry critics are fighting this aspect of the rule, arguing that giving the government access to their sensitive intellectual property—the secret sauce of their algorithms—is too big a risk. In an interview, CFTC Commissioner J. Christopher Giancarlo, the lone Republican on the panel that approves rules at the agency, said it was a “retrograde action” that would have a “stifling impact on trading technology innovation in the United States.” Massad, for his part, promises final language that “respects and protects confidentiality” while still giving the agency a look at the code when it’s investigating problems. “Our desire has never been to require that source code be turned over to us routinely,” he says. In another approach, the SEC is drafting an “anti-disruptive trading" rule as a preventive measure against potentially dangerous forms of high-volume, high-frequency trading. The SEC has not announced what trading strategies it will try to outlaw—as of now, the rule is being signaled but hasn’t been formally proposed—but the head of the agency has pointed to the Treasury market report as being “instructive” in identifying aggressive activities that could work against investors. Although those solutions all come from the regulatory side, it’s possible that high-frequency traders will ultimately find themselves corralled by the private sector. The hero, if there was one, of Lewis's “Flash Boys” was a new firm called IEX: a startup stock-trading venue whose founders wanted to provide investors with a protected place to trade without being “scalped" by predatory traders who had faster access to data from exchanges. Their innovation was a “speed bump”—a coil of fiber optic cable designed to slow down market access by 350 microseconds. In September 2015, IEX asked the SEC to allow it to become a full-fledged stock exchange, like the NYSE and NASDAQ; after months of intense lobbying on both sides of the proposal, the SEC signed off on its application in June—marking a major milestone in the agency's response to high-frequency trading. It's evidence that regulators are willing to let the private sector sort out some of the big concerns cropping up with trading technology. “They’re standing on the sidelines watching the private sector experiment with market design,” Kirilenko said of regulators, predicting that not much more than that would happen soon. “They will stand on the sidelines until the next flash crash.” 5 signs you, personally, are disrupting the banking system The charter war Welcome to the Future of Money Can Washington control high-tech lending?

Cramer created the acronym FANG for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, now under the parent name of Alphabet. The new abbreviation of FAAA represents Facebook, Alibaba, Alphabet and Amazon. "We have to talk about how these FAAA stocks got their groove back in order to figure out what it means for them going forward as we head into the fourth quarter," the "Mad Money" host said. On Tuesday, JPMorgan raised its 2017 year-end price targets for FANG stocks, noting that investors have returned to the group in search of growth. While many investors may question why they should care about 2017 year-end targets when it's not even the end of 2016 yet, Cramer clarified why it's important for those seeking growth. "Real growth investors don't particularly care about this year's numbers because classic high-growth stocks always look expensive on the near-term estimates. But if things go right, they will turn out to be very cheap once we get to the out-years," Cramer said. VCG | Getty Images Alibaba Group Chairman Jack Ma Alphabet currently sells for 19 times next year's earnings estimates, the same earnings multiple of the average stock in the S&P 500. Considering the company's rapid growth, Cramer found the earnings multiple insanely cheap. Facebook was even cheaper. Its growth rate is more than 30 percent, yet it only sells for 25-times earnings. Amazon and Netflix were more problematic for Cramer. JPMorgan came up with a blended formula that takes into account Amazon's Web Services to get to its $1,000 price target. The analyst got to the Netflix valuation by trying to value the company's international revenue and streaming earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Cramer explained why he booted Netflix from FANG, stating "I just can't trust Netflix after two consecutive missed quarters until I see some acceleration in domestic sign-ups." While JPMorgan did not formally cover Alibaba, it still valued the stock at $135 on the sum of parts basis, up from $108 on Tuesday. So, when Cramer heard CNBC's "Halftime Report" discussing FANG on Tuesday, he decided to make a surprise appearance on the show to present FAAA. "I made my case that FAAA has a long, long way to run, just like the 'Sound of Music,' but I stood my ground about Netflix concerns, point blank saying that Amazon is now disrupting them," Cramer said. Some of the move behind these stocks on Tuesday was simply because of scarcity of value, too. There aren't many consistent high-growth stocks out there right now. Many have also asked Cramer why he has not included Apple in the FAAA acronym. But after two down quarters, Apple no longer looked like a classic growth story to Cramer. "I think these companies have the ability to grow for years. With the exception of Alphabet's rumored interest in acquiring Twitter, FAAA represents the complete package," Cramer said. Cramer said the market is once again in fast-growth mode, thanks to the Federal Reserve admitting that the economy has slowed. Cramer's charitable trust owns Facebook and Alphabet. He thinks Amazon is too expensive currently, and he said he missed Alibaba. With a positive outlook for the future on this group, Cramer recommended investors to own one or two of FAAA in their portfolio. Questions for Cramer?

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 30 September 2016 | MYT 6:50 AM Wall St falls sharply on worries about banks NEW YORK: Wall Street dropped on Thursday, weighed down by Apple as well as selling in Wells Fargo, Citigroup and other major banks as investors worried about the health of Deutsche Bank. The S&P 500 financial index declined 1.49 percent after Bloomberg reported that some hedge funds have withdrawn excess cash and positions held at the German lender. Growing concerns over the stability of Germany's biggest bank have pushed its shares to record lows and its U.S.-listed stock on Thursday tumbled 6.7 percent. "This Deutsche Bank story is really casting a very long shadow over equity markets," said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group, in New York. "In some respects, it speaks to fears over large money-center banks having serious problems, and the last time we had that conversation was the financial crisis." Adding to negative sentiment in the banking sector, Wells Fargo & Co lost 2.07 percent after U.S. lawmakers rebuked CEO John Stumpf over his handling of sales abuses. Citigroup dropped 2.28 percent and JPMorgan Chase fell 1.59 percent. Apple fell 1.55 percent after Barclays cut its price target. The stock was the biggest drag on Wall Street. The S&P healthcare index lost 1.84 percent and also weighed heavily on the S&P 500 as shares of Merck and Johnson & Johnson declined. Among the gainers, Qualcomm jumped 6.3 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported the chipmaker is in talks to buy NXP Semiconductors. NXP surged 16.88 percent. Up 5 percent this year, the S&P 500 is trading near 16 times expected earnings, above its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. "Equity valuations are stretched and priced for perfection," said Mike Baele, managing director with the private client reserve group at U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. "I would not be surprised to see additional volatility." The CBOE Volatility Index, a gauge of near-term investor anxiety, jumped 14 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 1.07 percent to 18,143.45 points at the close, its sharpest decline since Sept 13. The S&P 500 lost 0.93 percent to end at 2,151.13 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.93 percent to 5,269.15. The S&P utilities index, which is sensitive to interest rates, fell 1.45 percent, its fifth day of losses in a row. Oil prices were up a day after OPEC members agreed to curb production, even as analysts raised questions about the effectiveness of the deal. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.87-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.09-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 35 new lows. About 7.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 7.0 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Corporate News , Banking , Markets You May Be Interested KLK posts offer document to MP Evans shareholders Gas Malaysia’s outlook remains subdued Market ends week lower Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official China badminton star Lin Dan apologises for affair with model while wife was pregnant Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Cyclist has grand tales to tell after going through 22 countries Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot The Star's executive editor Soo Ewe Jin passes away Property Related advertisement Latest News ECB chief Draghi hints at more stimulus to come Opec moves closer to oil output deal as Iran gets new offer Wall St flat at the open; Nasdaq hits record high Prestariang wins RM3.5bil deal to revamp Immigration’s IT system Musa tables RM3.78bil surplus budget for Sabah Most Viewed in Business Prestariang wins RM3.5bil deal to revamp Immigration’s IT system Ringgit continues slide Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot SC appoints Gumuri as AOB executive chairman Ringgit opens lower against US dollar Prince Alwaleed sees Saudi currency depeg as last resort Opec moves closer to oil output deal as Iran gets new offer MDEC and UOA Holdings to set up gaming hub Musa tables RM3.78bil surplus budget for Sabah advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

The &quot;Fast Money&quot; traders weigh in.</p> How low can Deutsche go?    Thursday, 29 Sep 2016 | 5:10 PM ET | 05:40 Financials and the market could stay under pressure, as September winds down and traders fear Deutsche Bank could become the market's October surprise. Several strategists said Deutsche Bank is on the list, along with the U.S. presidential election, as a market concern in October. There is also the onset of earnings season and the usual calendar of economic reports that could influence the Fed's interest rate decision at its meetings in both early November and December. The Deutsche Bank story, which rippled across markets Thursday, has been moving to the fore as a risk because of fear of contagion. Strategists don't see a systemic risk, and they expect the German bank to come to some type of agreement with the U.S. Justice Department, which is seeking $14 billion for Deutsche's role in the mortgage-backed securities market. They see the biggest European bank finding some way to raise capital, first through selling assets, then rights or some other capital raise. The German government so far is standing back from helping Deutsche. "Deutsche Bank sneezing should not cause all of the other financials to catch the flu. The more important point is the uncertainty around the election season. That becomes the clear and present risk. What does it mean to the markets? We're going to assume it's negative either way," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. Analyst say markets have been somewhat comfortable with the idea of Democrat Hillary Clinton becoming president over Republican Donald Trump, if for no other reason than that she is much more predictable. If Republicans hold Congress, it would be status quo in Washington. So if there's a change in expectations, there could be some volatility. "It feels to me the basic point is the markets are not that focused now on pricing in some kind of big surprise, because they still put a relatively low probability on Trump being elected. The one thing that would be a risk is if he started moving up in the polls," said Bruce Kasman, chief global economist at JPMorgan. Jim Caron, fixed income portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, said the election is one fact that makes October a month for uncertainty, and the bond market may stay range bound as a result. "I think there's going to be enough uncertainty in the market, whether it's the election … it can go one way or the other. It just makes people de-risk, raise cash, stay closer to home and invest when there's opportunity. If there's a big move up or down people may react to it," said Caron. The 10-year Treasury note was yielding 1.55 percent late Thursday, just about even with the 1.56 percent where it started September. The S&P 500, down 20 points at 2,151 Thursday, was down 0.9 percent for the month of September, but the S&P was up 2.5 percent for the third quarter. Another big factor for markets will be economic data, given the spotty reports in August. The big report is the September employment data a week from Friday, and that needs to be strong to confirm that the Fed is on course to hike rates in December. Economists expect 176,000 nonfarm payrolls and an unemployment rate of 4.9 percent. "Given the August data we've been digesting in September has been pretty soft, as we get into October, one thing I'm going to be looking at is was August a blip," said Russ Koesterich, head of asset allocation for BlackRock's Global Allocation Fund. Friday is the last day of September trading, and there are a few important reports including personal income at 8:30 a.m. EDT, Chicago PMI at 9:45 a.m. and consumer sentiment at 10 a.m. Traders said a cloud could continue to hang over banks because of Deutsche Bank. U.S. financial institutions were dragged down Thursday on fear of contagion, after Bloomberg reported that 10 hedge funds that clear derivatives trades with the bank have withdrawn some excess cash and positions held at Deutsche. Barry Bausano, chairman of Deutsche's hedge fund business, told CNBC on Thursday that while there have been some outflows, there have also been inflows, which he said is "part of the typical ebbs and flows" of the prime brokerage business. Deutsche still has about 800 hedge fund clients, but Bausano said there is probably a perception issue for the bank. For traders, the headlines brought back shades of Bear Stearns, which failed when counter parties stepped away. "The risk of contagion like we had in the financial crisis is a lot different than it was back pre-2008," said Caron, adding financial institutions have been stress tested and are subject to much stricter capital rules. Jeff Kleintop, chief global investment strategist with Charles Schwab, sees another risk factor for stocks in October — corporate earnings. He said October may be a time of weakness for stocks and it would not surprise him to see a 5 percent or so sell-off. "For October, I think the big one is going to be earnings. We're at the point where the gap between expectations and actual earnings is the widest it's been since 2009," said Kleintop. He said the difference between the next 12 months' estimates versus the last 12 months' earnings is 20 percent. "Given the global backdrop, there's just no way to get that kind of sales growth for that type of bottom line." Earnings season starts right after Columbus Day, when Alcoa reports as well as major banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo. "I don't think there's going to be a big bear market, because there's other supporting factors. I do think we could see a run of volatility," said Kleintop. "We might be overdue."

The S&P 500 financial index declined 1.49 percent after Bloomberg reported that some hedge funds have withdrawn excess cash and positions held at the German lender. Growing concerns over the stability of Germany's biggest bank have pushed its shares to record lows and its U.S.-listed stock on Thursday tumbled 6.7 percent. "This Deutsche Bank story is really casting a very long shadow over equity markets," said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group, in New York. "In some respects, it speaks to fears over large money-center banks having serious problems, and the last time we had that conversation was the financial crisis." Adding to negative sentiment in the banking sector, Wells Fargo & Co lost 2.07 percent after U.S. lawmakers rebuked CEO John Stumpf over his handling of sales abuses. Citigroup dropped 2.28 percent and JPMorgan Chase (Swiss: JPM.SW - news) fell 1.59 percent. Apple fell 1.55 percent after Barclays cut its price target. The stock was the biggest drag on Wall Street. The S&P healthcare index lost 1.84 percent and also weighed heavily on the S&P 500 as shares of Merck (LSE: 0O14.L - news) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ - news) declined. Among the gainers, Qualcomm jumped 6.3 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported the chipmaker is in talks to buy NXP Semiconductors (NasdaqGS: NXPI - news) . NXP surged 16.88 percent. Up 5 percent this year, the S&P 500 is trading near 16 times expected earnings, above its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. "Equity valuations are stretched and priced for perfection," said Mike Baele, managing director with the private client reserve group at U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. "I would not be surprised to see additional volatility." The CBOE Volatility Index, a gauge of near-term investor anxiety, jumped 14 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 1.07 percent to 18,143.45 points at the close, its sharpest decline since Sept 13. The S&P 500 lost 0.93 percent to end at 2,151.13 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.93 percent to 5,269.15. The S&P utilities index, which is sensitive to interest rates, fell 1.45 percent, its fifth day of losses in a row. Oil prices were up a day after OPEC members agreed to curb production, even as analysts raised questions about the effectiveness of the deal. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.87-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.09-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 35 new lows. About 7.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 7.0 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters (Dusseldorf: TOC.DU - news) data.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermidMore By Jason Lange WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth was less sluggish than previously thought in the second quarter as exports grew more than imports and businesses raised their investments, hopeful signs for the economic outlook. Gross domestic product expanded at a 1.4 percent annual rate, the Commerce Department said on Thursday in its third estimate of GDP. That was up from the 1.1 percent rate it reported last month and higher than analysts' expectations. The revision incorporated data that showed businesses cut investments in buildings and equipment less than the government previously estimated, while they sank more money into research and development. Other data released by the Commerce Department showed America's trade deficit for goods shrank in August, boding well for third-quarter growth. "It now appears that growth is slowly making its way back on to firmer ground," said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. Growth in overall business investment was revised to show a 1 percent annual rate of expansion, the first gain since the third quarter of last year, suggesting the worst of an energy-sector-led slump in business investment might be over. The slump, fueled by a sharp drop in oil prices that hit America's energy industry, has worried policymakers at the Federal Reserve because less investment could hurt economic growth over the longer term. The economy has struggled to regain momentum since output started slowing in the last six months of 2015 and the overall growth rate for GDP in the second quarter remained below historically normal rates. That could give grist to Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump's argument that the economy has sickened under the Obama administration. At the same time, consumer spending, which makes up more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was robust in the second quarter, rising at a 4.3 percent annual rate, while growth in exports outstripped that of imports enough to boost GDP by the most since the third quarter of 2014. But companies continued to run down their inventories aggressively, reducing stocks by $50.2 billion and subtracting from GDP growth, while home building also sank. The U.S. dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies while yields on U.S. government debt were higher. The GDP data is unlikely to have much impact on the near-term outlook for monetary policy although it could make Fed policymakers more confident the U.S. economy is resisting weaker growth abroad. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen repeated on Wednesday that Fed policymakers expect to raise interest rates by the end of the year because they worry that gathering steam in the U.S. labor market could fuel inflation. New claims for unemployment benefits rose slightly last week but remained at levels consistent with a healthy job market, according to a separate report from the Labor Department. The Commerce Department is due to release new inflation data on Friday. The government also reported that after-tax corporate profits fell at a 1.9 percent rate in the second quarter, a smaller drop than initially estimated. With profits declining, an alternative measure of growth, gross domestic income, or GDI, dropped at a 0.2 percent rate in the second quarter. GDI measures the economy's performance from the income side.

Off the Street Video Research Politics World Science Policy Tech Energy Religion Defense Sports Recent Videos Advertisement: September 30, 2016 Banking Really Hasn't Changed Much Since the PanicBy Jeffrey Snider The concept of what I call "math as money" is often a difficult one to grasp, particularly when still anchored to the traditional view of money and banking. A bank is supposed to be a money multiplier, a trusted institution that takes in currency or hard money, puts it in a vault and then lends it out fractionally in the form of deposits. As economists still believe to this day, this type of system gives the central bank enormous powers and responsibilities as the sole determinant of "base money" (where exogenous hard money does not exist). That is how quantitative easing is largely viewed, as a tremendous increase in the amount of that so-called base money. This isn't actually how banks work, thus by extension money, and it hasn't been that way for a very long time. As if it weren't completely obvious by now, monetary authorities have no idea what they are doing in large part because they are stuck in the past, thinking about ways to control a system that hasn't truly been the marginal source of additional resources and expansion since maybe as far back as the 1950's. The introduction of eurodollars was not just as an added marketplace for dollars trading overseas, it was the evolution of money itself where bank balance sheets would be the overriding factor for expansion or, as now, contraction. The way in which banks exercise control over their own resources has likewise evolved, aided in large part by the adoption of regulations that through the last decades of the 20th century emphasized assets more than liabilities. These were the adoptions of capital ratios but more so the regulatory arbitrage opportunities by which banks could manage them. Before the 1980's, bank supervision was accomplished by experienced bank examiners using judgments, not numbers. The 1978 FDIC Manual of Examination Policies, for example, instructed the agency's examiners to be more holistic in their approach because: "...capital ratios...are but a first approximation of a bank's ability to withstand adversity. A low capital ratio by itself is no more conclusive of a bank's weakness than a high ratio is of its invulnerability." There is a great deal of timeless truth to that statement, but in the case of bank supervision it marked something of an endpoint for that approach. The industry had already undergone radical changes right down to the firms most representative of the traditional format itself: the S&L's and thrifts. Whereas prior to the 1970's banking had appeared highly stable with very few failures, the Great Inflation would change that, unleashing not just more of them but featuring larger firms like Franklin National Bank in 1974 and First Pennsylvania in 1980. The causes of both higher bank risks and failures were viewed somewhat properly as the overhang of 1930's regulation, primarily Regulation Q's impositions at a time when interest rates were rising (overly plentiful money in the real economy). But there was much more to it than that, as monetary evolution was arguably a much bigger factor and one that was poorly understood often by the banks deploying the fruits of it. I wrote in April last year: "As late as 1972, S&L's were absent from the nascent repo market, but by 1978 they had added about $4.8 billion in repo liabilities, totaling up to about 1% of the entire liability structure. By 1984, around the time Home State was collateralizing lending with securities that didn't exist, repo liabilities had expanded almost tenfold to $43 billion, or slightly less than 4% of a rapidly expanding balance sheet base. Total repo reliance would peak in Q1 1989, with almost $105 billion in liabilities, or just shy of 7% of total funding." The S&L crisis itself was predicated in very large part upon those firms that had chosen to move away from traditional banking. The FDIC reported in 1984 that, "thrifts with annual growth rates of less than 15 percent had more than 80 percent of their liabilities in traditional retail deposits (generally in accounts of less than $100,000), the comparable figure for thrifts growing at rates in excess of 50 percent per year was only 59 percent." Those banks that were rapidly expanding were those moving to wholesale funding formats. As that was happening, you can almost appreciate just how the supervisory model of bank regulation was increasingly out of place; it no longer fit the times. Rather than update and retrain examiners for modern money, regulation was left largely to the banks themselves. Politicians and "experts" didn't believe that was the case, of course, as that was the whole point of moving to the math. In other words, by instituting "constraints" like capital ratios it was believed that banks could do what they wanted to do while still allowing for a relatively solid determination about whatever that might be. If regulators couldn't understand and appreciate how they were getting funded (the liability side) then at least they would track what banks did with all that funding regardless of where it came from. The regulatory environment began to adopt this approach in 1981 coincident to the double dip recession that marked the end of the Great Inflation. Federal banking agencies introduced explicit capital requirements, though initially the definition of what could be counted as "capital" varied by agency. These preliminary steps intended to measure a crude leverage ratio of "primary capital" to average total assets. The Federal Reserve and OCC began with a minimum ratio of 6% for community banks and 5% for larger regional firms (national banks were at the time largely still prohibited). This mathematical approach was further cemented by the International Lending and Supervision Act of 1983. The law pushed for further uniform definitions and standards to be developed by 1985, including a closer model to that which was being developed in Europe, including the "risk bucket" approach that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had already proposed. These would all harmonize into the Basel Capital Accord in 1988. Initially, the bucket model seems straightforward and even logical. A "riskier" asset as determined by regulators (the first problem) is given a higher risk-weighting (RWA - risk-weighted assets), which sounds appropriate enough. The initial Basel framework included four buckets but over time those have been expanded and the rules governing what goes where have been altered to give banks far more discretion in deciding RWA treatment. The consequences were and still are enormous. For example, in the initial framework residential mortgages were assigned to the 50% bucket. However, "claims or guarantees" provided by "qualifying" banks and entities (primarily, at the start, the GSE's) would be assigned instead to the 20% bucket. Thus, a bank for a given amount of statutorily-defined "capital" could hold two and a half times more assets if they could "somehow" define those assets by the "claims and guarantees" of "qualifying" counterparties. In many ways, it was just that simple, as through the 1990's and 2000's the ability to manage these buckets became paramount for balance sheet expansion (capital efficiency). By the initial outbreak of the crisis in 2007, the ability to manage RWA was as monetary as whatever futility the Federal Reserve or any other central bank offered or would offer. I wrote earlier this month about one specific but highly illuminating example: "The answers start in the footnotes. In AIG's 2007 Annual Report filing, the company reported on Page 33 deep within the recesses of so much mind-numbing but relevant minutiae that it had written $527 billion, more than half a trillion, gross notional exposure into its AIGFP subsidiary super senior credit default swap portfolio. While that should have been enough of a wake up on its own, it was the disposition of the portfolio that truly starts to explain the hidden panic of 2008. Of that $527 billion gross notional, AIG detailed that $379 billion ‘were written to facilitate regulatory capital relief for financial institutions primarily in Europe.'" Without knowing anything about credit default swaps, the intent is relatively easy to understand in general terms. These European banks were not interested in hedging per se, rather they were interested in AIG's ability to help them to "... appear to be less risky so that they could be specified as such in the regulatory framework of Basel II, leading them to be able to hold (vastly) more assets for a given amount of ‘capital.'" Math as money - offered CDS from a "qualifying" insurance company, the highly-rated insurance firm AIG, meant that European banks could reduce their RWA's by manipulating the bucket to which those assets would belong accomplishing a still unknown though likely massive systemic balance sheet expansion throughout the middle 2000's. To hear Ben Bernanke or now Janet Yellen tell it (or Mario Draghi), all that is behind us now as the financial system is supposedly far more "resilient" for having learned the hard way. Policymakers don't often go into specifics, of course, typically keeping these assertions general enough to accomplish their goal of assuring the public without being tied to specific ways those assurances could be so easily disproven. "Math as money" is one of the numerous ongoing gray areas. The "math" part is what was offered by AIG in the form of CDS, but that was just one example of how such math could be turned into money. The US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (a chilling title, even if occasionally warranted) issued a report on JP Morgan's 2012 London Whale episode that shows it in action. "In December 2011, JPMorgan Chase instructed the CIO to reduce its Risk Weighted Assets (RWA) to enable the bank, as a whole, to reduce its regulatory capital requirements. In response, in January 2012, rather than dispose of the high risk assets in the SCP - the most typical way to reduce RWA - the CIO launched a trading strategy that called for purchasing additional long credit derivatives to offset its short derivative positions and lower the CIO's RWA that way. That trading strategy not only ended up increasing the portfolio's size, risk, and RWA, but also, by taking the portfolio into a net long position, eliminated the hedging protections the SCP was originally supposed to provide." Without the ability to hedge (even badly) the CIO office would have been forced to sell assets to meet the bank's reduced RWA requirement or budget. The easy and fluid ability to lay off risk on some other "qualified" counterparty, whatever that might mean, has immediate monetary consequences, but most especially during times where the inability to hedge into math as money is not easy and fluid. This is the functional, modern definition of liquidity, having, importantly, absolutely nothing to do with the bank reserves created as a byproduct of "quantitative easing." It all further demonstrates how regulations in this way conform to the FDIC's 1978 Manual warning that, "A low capital ratio by itself is no more conclusive of a bank's weakness than a high ratio is of its invulnerability." In fact, at that time in 2012 there was something of a pandemic of bank math. Banks primarily in Europe were, as Deutsche Bank's then-co-CEO Anshu Jain said in September 2012, "under tremendous pressure to reduce risk-weighted assets." Left unsaid was just how much that might have been due to the fallout from AIG's (and others) downfall leaving a huge, systemic hole in offered math. Deutsche Bank, for one, began immediately to correct the problem. Just a few months later in January 2013, Jain and his management team were pleased to announce that the bank had successfully cut €55 billion in RWA in the fourth quarter of 2012 alone. The effect was an immediate increase in the bank's core capital ratio to 8% from less than 6% (and insufficient) at the end of 2011. Of that €55 billion "improvement", €18 billion was derived from the "roll out of advanced models", an additional €8 billion was due to "data improvement exercises", and a further €15 billion from "portfolio optimization." Deutsche never provided much detail about that last one apart from language indicating "optimizing risk mitigation" from which we can infer at least more hedging. Altogether, these new "maths" had the combined effect of an €8 billion capital infusion without a single euro having been committed or decommitted; all of it was balance sheet, well, voodoo. And though Deutsche was not alone in its RWA rejiggering at the time, again it was endemic throughout European banks but not only them (Morgan Stanley was was noted, too), it was perhaps its most blatant user. At that time, January 2013, DB's total RWA had been reduced to just 19% of its total assets. In other words, the full effect of all this math was to suggest that though Deutsche Bank still held an enormous amount of assets they weren't risky - at least in terms of regulatory treatment. As to actual risk, that may be another matter. The RWA reduction compared to RBS, for example, whose RWA equaled 35% of total assets around the same time; Barclay's was at 24%; BNP Paribas 29%; Credit Suisse 23%. About the only bank in Europe in DB's neighborhood of regulatory "de-risking" by math was UBS at 15%. The Swiss bank, however, had already embarked upon a true reorientation, actually cutting the size of the bank, not just RWA math, and hugely reducing its exposures. At the end of 2011, for example, UBS reported CHF36 trillion in total gross notional interest rate swaps. That gross exposure had declined to CHF28 trillion by the end of 2012, and CHF11.6 trillion at the end of last year. Deutsche Bank, on the contrary, chose a much different path, one of continued expansion determined to use the global wholesale banking industry's overall retreat as an opportunity to be positioned for the full recovery that was surely coming. I wrote last October: "What Deutsche did to restore balance in the wake of 2013's changed QE profit circumstances was almost unique (Credit Suisse would try something similar). The bank loaded additional capital early last year [2014], under circumstances that remain somewhat unclear, and then plowed ahead into as much risk as it could possibly source. In its press publications displaying those forward intentions in May 2014, the bank (this is somewhat unbelievable in hindsight, far more so than it was then) openly discussed how it expected to drive returns while maintaining leverage from new ventures into US junk and leveraged loans as well as emerging market debt." They say nobody ever rings a bell at any market top, but this might have been as close as we will ever see. Though DB didn't look risky in RWA terms and still doesn't now, we have every reason to suspect reality hasn't arrived at the same determination. The problem of math as money is that the math isn't always so mathematical. By that I mean popular perception about the use of math infers precision and accuracy; myths that in 2007 and 2008 were exposed in far more than the revulsion from AIG's "regulatory capital relief." In the case of DB after its post-2011 math RWA trimming, however, there may be more immediate concerns. Though it sounds somewhat simple where banks are just "allowed" to choose whatever models and hedges they want, in truth these models and hedges still have to conform to deeper often complex regulatory standards. If models that have been used to "de-risk" particular assets don't capture markets that are behaving "erratically", then their effectiveness in defining risk is called into question by regulations as well as operations. The same is true for hedges; you can assign CDS or some other technique to a particular asset, but if it doesn't perform as designed and expected, that hedge must be written down or written off leaving you again with a naked asset that demands more hedging (and effective hedging, which likely means higher costs to deploy especially given volatility changes; gamma), absorbing the change to the higher original RWA, or outright selling of the asset. None of these options are neutral, obviously, and often they have direct and immediate liquidity consequences. Earlier this week, Deutsche Bank's German cousin Commerzbank announced that it was contemplating suspending its dividend (since confirmed) as well as cutting 20% of its workforce. The former is a big deal since the bank just reinstituted it at the end of last year as an intentional signal that it had recovered from 2008 and its nationalization (it remains partly nationalized). In describing why Commerzbank might be taking such a radical, preventative step, the media seems to have fallen back on two particular concepts. The first is NIRP, acknowledging that was once believed to be "stimulus" is actually anti-stimulus in at least one way (leaving the others to still be discovered through reality). The second is this unspecified "market volatility" or "volatile markets." While perhaps seeming an innocuous description, there are terrible consequences hidden in the vagueness. Volatility is the big one, the chief arbiter of math as money. As the Senate report on the London Whale showed, JP Morgan changed its VaR methodology for its CIO portfolios and on an expedited basis - even characterizing the process of approval as "hurried." The reason was volatility had picked up at the time, forcing calculations of expected volatility to threaten to increase RWA by among other things reducing the modeled effectiveness of its hedges. By changing the math of the VaR governing condition, the effect was to reduce the anticipated loss exposure by 50%, thus reducing (inappropriately) CIO's contribution to the bank's overall RWA. Applying that same kind of scenario to DB (or Commerzbank, perhaps Credit Suisse and others?) in 2016, an environment that is at least comparable to what JP Morgan was facing in 2011 and 2012 (and as far as possible hedging is concerned, likely significantly more troubling with regard to systemic capacity), we can reasonably infer especially for a bank heavily dependent on models for having "de-risked" that there is a high degree of actual risk unwinding some unknown but significant part of that process. That negative pressure would be further amplified by an environment where total offered balance sheet capacity is limited; meaning where DB's ability to replace ineffective hedges with new ones might be constrained because the price or flexibility of what is currently offered is relatively uneconomical due to those systemic reductions in overall balance sheet capacity. We know without much doubt this is the case with systemic capacity since at least the middle of last year and remains ongoing by everything from negative swap spreads to hugely negative premiums on cross currency basis swaps. Any problem for Deutsche as far as math as money is concerned is not strictly a problem for the single German bank. As we found starting in August 2007, balance sheet capacity has the unfortunate tendency to be reversed in irreversible fashion once it gets beyond a certain point. In other words, given that math capacity overall in the system is driven by a relative few number of global banks, the impairment of one starts the process of systemic impairment for all (again, this doesn't necessarily imply crash, just irreversibility). For DB, that may be "most" true as it has tended toward especially a high absolute degree of derivative exposure (offered capacity) as well as its relative position compared to where almost all of its peers have been drastically cutting back. In what might prove to be the worst blow yet, the reason for such a possibly troubling volatility shock in math as money is QE itself; not what QE actually accomplished, rather what everyone thought it would. Even those banks with a more realistic economic assessment seemed to have modeled low financial volatility as a consequence of so much "money printing." The effect, then, of the past year and a half was to so thoroughly disprove that assumption as to destroy it. A world where QE isn't actually "money printing" isn't the same at all. The amount of balance sheet capacity demolished because of being forced into a more realistic financial taxonomy may be incalculable, but we can feel directly its consequences - none more so than Deutsche Bank at this moment. It is an absolute falsehood that banking has changed since the panic. Regulations have changed the numbers but by and large the system survived if only in diminished form and flow, not at all the categorical shifts that are often claimed. The same vulnerabilities inherent in the pre-crisis eurodollar/wholesale system remain, most especially the regulatory emphasis on flawed math that was developed precisely because funding formats (liabilities) started to become utterly complex and convoluted. Shifting focus to credit losses on the asset side as if they were the biggest danger was in reality nothing more than an ill-conceived shortcut. The monetary system was radically overhauled (of its own volition and conduct) during the last half of the 20th century, but there is a universal truth that remains especially relevant in the 21st; money is still all about liabilities no matter what any regulatory regime decides.

It wasn't much. The outlet reported that some hedge funds that clear derivatives trades with the bank had withdrawn some positions, "a sign of counterparties'" mounting concerns about doing business with Europe's largest investment bank. Not much, but it revived long-dormant memories of 2008. Deutsche Bank's U.S.-traded shares dropped 7 percent. European banks that trade in the U.S. fell roughly 3 percent. The S&P 500 shed 15 points in a matter of minutes. U.S. banks dropped, as well. JPMorgan Chase lost 1.5 percent. Wait a minute. What do (possible) issues at Deutsche Bank have to do with JPMorgan? And why would the entire market drop? Everything dropped: consumer staples, consumer discretionary and health care. Even Whirlpool fell $2. What's Whirlpool got to do with Deutsche Bank? Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images On the surface, not much. But in the post-financial crisis worldview, it doesn't take much. The logic goes like this: If Deutsche Bank did go under, it's not a positive. You would have a big distressed international seller of assets. Consumers would worry. What are the chances that the bank could go under? Very, very small. The German government would almost certainly step in as a last resort. But — this is the post-financial crisis mindset — the chances are not zero. A lot of things no one thought were correlated turned out to be correlated in 2008. Problems at Deutsche Bank could lead to higher credit costs and slower economic growth. Markets hate uncertainty. Counterparty risk creates uncertainty. This was the central lesson from the Lehman crisis. You get the point. A slightly paranoid worldview is still very prevalent about banks that have trouble. Paranoid, but not completely absurd. But what about the rest of the market? Why exactly did, say, Whirlpool drop $2? First, the market trend in many sectors (health care, consumer staples) was already down before the story came out. But the more important reason is that today's trading action is dominated by traders who will pull bids when there is market uncertainty. When you have heavier volume with fewer bids, prices drop to attract buyers. Throw in trend following programs and that will more than adequately explain how stocks that are not correlated could drop together.

The S&P 500 financial index dropped 1.11 percent after Bloomberg reported that some hedge funds have withdrawn excess cash and positions held at the German lender. Concerns over the stability of Germany's biggest bank have pushed its shares to record lows and its U.S.-listed stock on Thursday tumbled 6.6 percent. Wells Fargo & Co lost 1.67 percent after U.S. lawmakers rebuked CEO John Stumpf over his handling of sales abuses. Citigroup dropped 1.77 percent and JPMorgan Chase (Swiss: JPM.SW - news) fell 1.47 percent. Apple fell 1.44 percent after Barclays cut its price target. The stock was the biggest drag on Wall Street. The S&P healthcare index lost 1.4 percent and also weighed heavily on the S&P 500 as shares of Merck (LSE: 0O14.L - news) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ - news) declined. "Equity valuations are stretched and priced for perfection," said Mike Baele, managing director with the private client reserve group at U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. "I would not be surprised to see additional volatility." The CBOE Volatility Index, a gauge of near-term investor anxiety, jumped 14 percent. At 2:32 pm ET, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 0.85 percent to 18,183.69 points and the S&P 500 had lost 0.65 percent to 2,157.28. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.66 percent to 5,283.58. The S&P utilities index, which is sensitive to interest rates, fell 1.01 percent and was on track for its fifth day of losses in a row. Oil prices were up a day after OPEC members agreed to curb production, even as analysts raised questions about the effectiveness of the deal. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.98-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.49-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 74 new highs and 30 new lows.

KEEPING SCORE: Japan’s Nikkei 225 slumped 1.6 percent to 16,435.61 and South Korea’s Kospi fell 0.9 percent to 2,051.10. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index retreated 1.3 percent to 23,440.84. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 dropped 0.8 percent to 5,425.80. China’s Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.1 percent to 3,000.58. Stocks in Singapore and other Southeast Asian countries were also lower. ANALYST’S TAKE: “Risk sentiment waned overnight as worries about global banks weighed on markets,” said Alex Wijaya, senior sales trader at CMC Markets in Singapore. “Stock markets worldwide are rattled by the latest development at Deutsche Bank.” BANK WOES: U.S. authorities are seeking $14 billion from Deutsche Bank to settle legal claims over its sales of mortgage securities in 2007 and 2008, which helped kick off a global financial crisis. The bank said it had struck a deal to sell a subsidiary and stressed that it was not seeking government help but investors are worried what will happen to Germany’s biggest lender and to the broader financial system if Deutsche Bank runs low on capital. Analysts said the troubles at Deutsche Bank are raising scrutiny over other banks in Europe, which are also in talks regarding mortgage settlement with the U.S. authorities. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks finished lower on Thursday as drug companies and banks absorbed large losses. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 195.79 points, or 1.1 percent, to 18,143.45. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index sank 20.24 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,151.13. The Nasdaq composite dropped 49.39 points, or 0.9 percent, to 5,269.15. OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 20 cents to $47.62 per barrel in New York. The contract gained 78 cents, or 1.7 percent, to close at $47.83 a barrel on Thursday. Oil prices surged earlier this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than third of the world’s oil, agreed to a small cut in production in a surprise decision Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell 36 cents to $49.45 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 101.37 yen from 101.16 yen while the euro fell to $1.121 from $1.122.

The Michigan Finance Authority sold the bonds, backed only by property taxes, in a private placement with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Danelle Gittus, a spokeswoman for the state Treasury Department, said in an emailed statement. The net interest cost, or the estimated overall interest expense of the securities, was 3.78 percent through March 31, 2023. The refinancing was authorized by a new state law in June that reorganized the district into two districts, with state aid backing the existing bonds being transferred to a new district set up to operate schools. The old district exists only to repay outstanding debt and other liabilities. The old district will continue to collect a property tax to repay the new debt. The outstanding bonds issued in 2011 and 2012 are refinanced at par plus a redemption premium. Without the refinancing the shift threatened to trigger a technical default on the bonds, which have been cut five levels into junk by S&P Global Ratings because of the uncertainty. Some of the to-be-refinanced bonds that mature in 2018 rose Wednesday to 98.4 cents on the dollar from 95.3 cents a day earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The S&P 500 financial index dropped 1.11 percent after Bloomberg reported that some hedge funds have withdrawn excess cash and positions held at the German lender. Concerns over the stability of Germany's biggest bank have pushed its shares to record lows and its U.S.-listed stock on Thursday tumbled 6.6 percent. Wells Fargo & Co lost 1.67 percent after U.S. lawmakers rebuked CEO John Stumpf over his handling of sales abuses. Citigroup dropped 1.77 percent and JPMorgan Chase fell 1.47 percent. Apple fell 1.44 percent after Barclays cut its price target. The stock was the biggest drag on Wall Street. The S&P healthcare index lost 1.4 percent and also weighed heavily on the S&P 500 as shares of Merck and Johnson & Johnson declined. "Equity valuations are stretched and priced for perfection," said Mike Baele, managing director with the private client reserve group at U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. "I would not be surprised to see additional volatility." The CBOE Volatility Index, a gauge of near-term investor anxiety, jumped 14 percent. At 2:32 pm ET, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 0.85 percent to 18,183.69 points and the S&P 500 had lost 0.65 percent to 2,157.28. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.66 percent to 5,283.58. The S&P utilities index, which is sensitive to interest rates, fell 1.01 percent and was on track for its fifth day of losses in a row. Oil prices were up a day after OPEC members agreed to curb production, even as analysts raised questions about the effectiveness of the deal. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.98-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.49-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 74 new highs and 30 new lows.

Like this story, share it with millions of investors on M3 US economy less sluggish in Q2; companies investing more Gross domestic product expanded at a 1.4 percent annual rate, the Commerce Department said on Thursday in its third estimate of GDP. That was up from the 1.1 percent rate it reported last month and higher than analysts' expectations. Post Your Comments Share Cancel US economic growth was less sluggish than previously thought in the second quarter as exports grew more than imports and businesses raised their investments, hopeful signs for the economic outlook. Gross domestic product expanded at a 1.4 percent annual rate, the Commerce Department said on Thursday in its third estimate of GDP. That was up from the 1.1 percent rate it reported last month and higher than analysts' expectations. The revision incorporated data that showed businesses cut investments in buildings and equipment less than the government previously estimated, while they sank more money into research and development. Other data released by the Commerce Department showed America's trade deficit for goods shrank in August, boding well for third-quarter growth. "It now appears that growth is slowly making its way back on to firmer ground," said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. Growth in overall business investment was revised to show a 1 percent annual rate of expansion, the first gain since the third quarter of last year, suggesting the worst of an energy-sector-led slump in business investment might be over. The slump, fueled by a sharp drop in oil prices that hit America's energy industry, has worried policymakers at the Federal Reserve because less investment could hurt economic growth over the longer term. The economy has struggled to regain momentum since output started slowing in the last six months of 2015 and the overall growth rate for GDP in the second quarter remained below historically normal rates. That could give grist to Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump's argument that the economy has sickened under the Obama administration. At the same time, consumer spending, which makes up more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was robust in the second quarter, rising at a 4.3 percent annual rate, while growth in exports outstripped that of imports enough to boost GDP by the most since the third quarter of 2014. But companies continued to run down their inventories aggressively, reducing stocks by USD50.2 billion and subtracting from GDP growth, while home building also sank. The U.S. dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies while yields on U.S. government debt were higher. The GDP data is unlikely to have much impact on the near-term outlook for monetary policy although it could make Fed policymakers more confident the U.S. economy is resisting weaker growth abroad. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen repeated on Wednesday that Fed policymakers expect to raise interest rates by the end of the year because they worry that gathering steam in the U.S. labor market could fuel inflation. New claims for unemployment benefits rose slightly last week but remained at levels consistent with a healthy job market, according to a separate report from the Labor Department. The Commerce Department is due to release new inflation data on Friday. The government also reported that after-tax corporate profits fell at a 1.9 percent rate in the second quarter, a smaller drop than initially estimated. With profits declining, an alternative measure of growth, gross domestic income, or GDI, dropped at a 0.2 percent rate in the second quarter. GDI measures the economy's performance from the income side. Tags  US exports GDP investments government Buy, Hold, Sell ?

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Stocks Forex Commodities Gold & Silver Today's Pick Portfolio Tracker MF risks: SEBI mulls stronger scales Tanya Thomas   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet To secure public investments to further the growth of mutual fund industry Mumbai, September 29:   After the investment shocks of last year that rattled some mutual fund buyers, capital market regulator SEBI has been working on strengthening the overall risk management system of the industry. According to sources, the regulator is keen on introducing stronger risk parameters to secure public investments further in the ₹15-lakh crore mutual fund industry. An industry-wide survey commissioned by the Securities and Exchange Board of India and carried out by industry body AMFI assessing the current risk management systems of mutual funds has just been completed, according to senior fund executive familiar with the exercise. The Association of Mutual Funds in India has brought in KPMG as a consultant in this process, which probed the risk management systems that the 42 fund houses in the industry have in place to deal with enterprise risk, investment risks, operational risks and IT risks. Amtek Auto episode After auto component manufacturer Amtek Auto defaulted on corporate debt that it had issued last August, investors in two debt schemes of JP Morgan Asset Management India — which had invested in those instruments — were temporarily unable to withdraw part of their investments. As panic set in, debt fund investors in schemes of Franklin Templeton Asset Management pulled out money from their investments as well. While the latter has since been able to reassure investors and shore up its assets, JP Morgan AMC sold its domestic asset management business to its much smaller rival Edelweiss Asset Management. Since then, SEBI has brought credit rating agencies under its scanner, reviewing their response mechanism to defaults on instruments they have rated and the warning systems they have in place for investors of such instruments. SEBI also introduced “gating” norms, rules regulating how a mutual fund will respond in case of a default on an investment it has made and restricting its ability to cap withdrawals by retail investors, like JP Morgan did. Upgrading systems CVR Rajendran, CEO, AMFI, said the exercise will results in new rules upgrading the risk management systems already required of the fund industry. “It will focus mostly on credit risk, the exposure that an AMC can take to a certain corporate, the group-level exposure limits that fund houses cannot solely rely on external credit rating agencies.” “The new rules will also focus on the kind of people that a risk management team must have,” Rajendran added. The report will be submitted to SEBI in the next few days, based on which an updated circular on risk management is likely. “India is a maturing risk market,” a senior fund executive told BusinessLine. “During the survey, MNC mutual funds and well-established fund houses which have embedded reporting and risk management processes performed better, while smaller fund houses may not have this matrix in place yet. Ultimately, it’s public money that is at stake.” (This article was published on September 29, 2016) Related NEWS MF investment in a firm’s debt capped at 10% of scheme’s NAV TOPICS business (general) | investor grievance | economy, business and finance | mutual funds | Get more of your favourite news delivered to your inbox SEND MY NEWS Please enter your email.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid By Jason Lange | WASHINGTON WASHINGTON U.S. economic growth was less sluggish than previously thought in the second quarter as exports grew more than imports and businesses raised their investments, hopeful signs for the economic outlook. Gross domestic product expanded at a 1.4 percent annual rate, the Commerce Department said on Thursday in its third estimate of GDP. That was up from the 1.1 percent rate it reported last month and higher than analysts' expectations. The revision incorporated data that showed businesses cut investments in buildings and equipment less than the government previously estimated, while they sank more money into research and development. Other data released by the Commerce Department showed America's trade deficit for goods shrank in August, boding well for third-quarter growth. "It now appears that growth is slowly making its way back on to firmer ground," said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. Growth in overall business investment was revised to show a 1 percent annual rate of expansion, the first gain since the third quarter of last year, suggesting the worst of an energy-sector-led slump in business investment might be over. The slump, fueled by a sharp drop in oil prices that hit America's energy industry, has worried policymakers at the Federal Reserve because less investment could hurt economic growth over the longer term. The economy has struggled to regain momentum since output started slowing in the last six months of 2015 and the overall growth rate for GDP in the second quarter remained below historically normal rates. That could give grist to Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump's argument that the economy has sickened under the Obama administration. At the same time, consumer spending, which makes up more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was robust in the second quarter, rising at a 4.3 percent annual rate, while growth in exports outstripped that of imports enough to boost GDP by the most since the third quarter of 2014. But companies continued to run down their inventories aggressively, reducing stocks by $50.2 billion and subtracting from GDP growth, while home building also sank. The U.S. dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies while yields on U.S. government debt were higher. The GDP data is unlikely to have much impact on the near-term outlook for monetary policy although it could make Fed policymakers more confident the U.S. economy is resisting weaker growth abroad. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen repeated on Wednesday that Fed policymakers expect to raise interest rates by the end of the year because they worry that gathering steam in the U.S. labor market could fuel inflation. New claims for unemployment benefits rose slightly last week but remained at levels consistent with a healthy job market, according to a separate report from the Labor Department. The Commerce Department is due to release new inflation data on Friday. The government also reported that after-tax corporate profits fell at a 1.9 percent rate in the second quarter, a smaller drop than initially estimated. With profits declining, an alternative measure of growth, gross domestic income, or GDI, dropped at a 0.2 percent rate in the second quarter. GDI measures the economy's performance from the income side.

Former Goldman Sachs analyst Mitchell Bayer-Goldman, 24, knocked out security guard Allewyn Tredoux at VIP hangout The Cuckoo Club in London’s Swallow Street last December. Central News 3 Mitchell Bayer-Goldman punched a doorman after refusing to pay his £500 bar bill at a VIP club in Mayfair Bayer-Goldman refused to pay £500 of a £1,500 bill and after assaulting Mr Tredoux was then dragged to the top floor by bouncers and held until police arrived, Westminster Magistrates heard. The exclusive private-members club, which describes itself as “the ultimate contemporary-chic destination”, counts Prince Harry, Kate Moss and Jude Law among its patrons. Mr Tredoux, a part-time bouncer who was also a security contractor protecting shipping from pirates in Somalia, has been unable to return to work since the incident. Bayer-Goldman is the former director of PR firm Glam London and was an associate for Barclays before he lost his job for failing to disclose his arrest. His Linkedin profile states he previously worked as an analyst for banking giants JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs. He admitted one count of assault by beating at an earlier hearing at Willesden Green magistrates court, where JPs found he also hurled homophobic abuse during the incident. Central News 3 Bayer-Goldman could be jailed when he is sentenced today at Westminster magistrates court Today he appeared for sentencing at Westminster magistrates court where he was spared a prison term. Ann Crighton, prosecuting, said: “The victim is Allewyn Tredoux, who works at the Cuckoo Club. “Mr Bayer-Goldman was there on 12 December and he was refusing to pay a bill amounting to about £500. “Mr Tredoux went over to another member of staff. “What happened in the end is that Mr Bayer-Goldman pointed his finger at Mr Tredoux and said ‘you are a gay c***’ and hit him in the face.” Mr Tredoux was knocked unconscious by Bayer-Goldman’s punch. He said: “I was called down from upstairs to go and assist a waitress, Jessica, because she had a problem with a gentleman refusing to pay his bill. “We asked the gentleman politely, ‘Sir, would you mind paying your bill?’ “He was very, very confident and he said, ‘I don’t have to pay my bill’ and I said, ‘Sir, unfortunately, you have to’.” RELATED STORIES DEATH IN PARADISE Mystery as JP Morgan banker, 37, and trader sister, 42, found dead in Seychelles villa after a day drinking AXE 'MURDER' BLOODBATH Stressed-out Barclays banker 'murdered his wife with an avalanche of more than 120 blows from an axe' hbos 'scam' 'Danny DeVito lookalike' banker 'used bribes to pay for sex with hookers in scam costing bank £245m' 'YOU CAN'T SAY NO TO A GREEK' What banker allegedly said to female colleague he is accused of sexually assaulting at work ONE-PUNCH KILL SUSPECT London man, 31, denies murdering former Coutts banker Oliver Dearlove as he appears in court Bayer-Goldman then began to walk towards the exit and Mr Tredoux followed him. He said: “I was following him on the left-hand side and another member of security came on the right-hand side. “He stopped at the foot of the stairs and faced me and at the time looked me straight in the eyes and said: ‘You are a gay c***’. “I felt ashamed and embarrassed. I would say it is unacceptable. “As I looked to the side, the gentleman was about a metre away from me. “As I looked back, I saw the punch coming to my right eye and after that it went black. “When I came back again, some of the security was helping me on both sides.” Alamy 3 The banker and his pals racked up a £1,500 tab at the Cuckoo Club, an exclusive hangout favoured by Prince Harry, Kate Moss and Jude Law Mr Tredoux added: “I had blurred vision for a couple of days, that same night I went to the hospital. “I have follow-up appointments for my eye and I have to see a doctor in February next year. “They said it is a build-up of pressure which can be caused by injury or a punch or something like that.” Mr Tredoux also said that he had lost his ability to work as a maritime security contractor because of injuries sustained in Bayer-Goldman’s attack. He said: “I am very disappointed. I was working in maritime security off the coast of Somalia. “I was just working part-time that December before I went to be deployed again. “Medicals for the maritime industry are strenuous. Any problems with your eyes or heart disease means I cannot work. That’s my future. I’m not on the sea anymore.” Probation officer Aidan Linton said Bayer-Goldman had lost his job with Barclays and had applied for benefits. He said: “He was out with his seven best friends as one of them had just qualified in their particular field. “The dispute was over money, if you have a table at a place there is a minimum amount they expect you to pay. “It was increased while they were there. It was £1500, they’d only spent £1,000, hence the £500 dispute.” Bayer-Goldman has two previous convictions, one for drink-driving and one for common assault in 2014, the court heard. Judge Nina Tempia handed Bayer-Goldman a one year community order, requiring him to perform 100 hours’ unpaid work, and banned him from drinking for 80 days with a 10pm and 6am curfew. She said: “He may say he is remorseful but he doesn’t have remorse for the victim, he has it for himself.” We pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?

(Facebook/Annie Korkki) A Minnesota family are searching for answers in the mysterious deaths of two sisters found dead in a luxury resort while vacationing in Seychelles. Minnesota natives Annie Korkki, 37, who works for JP Morgan Chase in Denver, and Robin Korkki, 42, a trader from Chicago, were found unresponsive and ultimately pronounced dead in their villa at the Maia Luxury Resort and Spa on Sept. 22, reported the Seychelles Nation, the country’s newspaper. They were scheduled to leave their upward $2,000 per night resort on Thursday after a week of vacationing but decided to extend their stay until Sept. 24.

Preliminary examinations indicated that the bodies of the two sisters did not show any signs of trauma. Police confiscated certain medications from the scene for the purpose of the investigation. According to hotel staff, the women were seen drinking throughout the day on Wednesday and needed help to their rooms at around 8:15 p.m. This was the last time either of the women were seen alive.

I don’t think they’ve provided her with any information.” He added, “Two things keep going through my mind: This isn’t happening, and we just want answers.” Local authorities are working jointly with American authorities in the investigation as autopsy results are pending to determine the exact cause of death.
