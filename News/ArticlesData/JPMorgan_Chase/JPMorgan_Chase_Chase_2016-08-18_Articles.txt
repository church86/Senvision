According to a regulatory filing, JPMorgan will collect the cash payment from the estate of Washington Mutual Bank, for which the FDIC acts as receiver. In exchange, JP Morgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets said it will drop its more than $1 billion in claims related to the Washington Mutual (WaMu) purchase. JPMorgan also said Deutsche Bank, the trustee overseeing 99 trusts holding residential mortgage securities backed by soured WaMu home loans, will have a claim against the estate. JPMorgan had filed lawsuits seeking to force the FDIC to indemnify it on claims relating to the WaMu purchase, in which it also assumed some of the thrift's liabilities. Deutsche Bank had filed a $10 billion lawsuit against the FDIC and JPMorgan over losses stemming from alleged defects in WaMu's mortgage underwriting. JPMorgan said the settlement requires court approval, and would end four WaMu-related lawsuits involving the bank and the FDIC, and pending in the federal court in Washington, D.C. The bank and the FDIC have long fought over who is liable to investors for claims arising from Seattle-based WaMu's collapse. WaMu had been nation's largest savings and loan before the FDIC seized it on Sept. 25, 2008 and sold its banking operations to New York-based JPMorgan for about $1.9 billion.

Christian Identity in the Workplace by Elliot Milco 8 . 19 . 16 On Monday, Yahoo Finance published an article examining the role of religious practice in the modern workplace. The article begins by considering a case of apparent anti-religious discrimination at the Manhattan office of JPMorgan Chase. Beginning in the early 2000s, a number of JPMorgan employees organized a Christian prayer group and bible study that met in company spaces. The group was fairly successful and well-attended for several years, but was ordered to cease meeting on company property in 2014, because corporate resources “can only be used for business purposes.” What counts as “business purposes” becomes somewhat confusing when we look at the measures currently being taken by JPMorgan to promote corporate diversity. The bank makes company resources available to hundreds of “employee networking chapters” devoted to connecting and supporting members of various identity groups (LGBT, disabled, Latino, black, etc.). Not having been to meetings of these groups myself, I suppose it’s possible that they exist solely for “business purposes,” but I doubt it. In all probability, “business purposes” are merely the excuse for a more natural and robust goal: building communities among people who share common viewpoints and experiences. Christians may look at this list of diversity organizations and feel aggrieved at the double standard. What distinguishes a Christian group from any of these others? Why would JPMorgan go out of its way to bus Muslim employees in the UK to prayers during the day, but ban a Christian prayer group from its offices? Surely those of Christian identity deserve just as much support as those who identify as LGBT, disabled, Asian, black, etc. Part of the answer lies in the way “identity” functions as a moral and political category. Identities occupy a paradoxical middle ground in contemporary popular anthropology. On the one hand, identities are accepted as brute facts of individual personalities—personal characteristics that are either unchosen, or chosen in a way that does not allow others to question the choice. If someone has a particular identity, that is simply “who they are”—end of story. On the other hand, identities are clearly a kind of social fiction. They are constructed around widespread patterns of appropriation and designation, and they do not generally admit of definition or demarcation based on objective attributes. No one bothers to ask what constitutes “being black” or “being Asian,” much less “being LGBT.” A person simply self-identifies, appropriates the label, and is identified socially as such—this is enough. Any attempt to pin down which characteristics entitle a person to these identities will quickly reach a dead end. This is not to say that real characteristics don’t play into the appropriation of an identity (they clearly do), or that identities are simply chosen by those who appropriate them (for the most part they aren’t), or that having a particular identity doesn’t have a real impact on the circumstances or shape of one’s life. What is distinctively constructed about identities is their differentiation from any ordinary social, cultural, or physical type—the elevation of a set of characteristics or labels into a personality-defining absolute. Christianity is not generally seen as an identity—being Christian is never seen as a fundamental feature of one’s personality, a given that cannot be questioned. Although one can be born into Christianity and raised Christian, we live in a society so saturated with lapsed Christians that no one has any illusions about Christianity being inextricable from the practice of one’s individual selfhood. Diversity officers treat Christianity differently from Islam for precisely this reason: Islam, like Christianity, is a religion. But Islam is recognized as an identity and given accommodations because, in the West, being Muslim generally goes along with being part of an ethnic minority. Ethnic status is at least partly unchosen, and is identify-defining—therefore Islam, as an expression of ethnic identity, deserves protection and cannot be questioned. Being Christian, on the other hand, is never seen as unchosen, and it does not place one in an ethnic minority. Christians are perceived as being over-represented and over-privileged, and Christianity is thought of as little more than an irrational, tasteless (and potentially pernicious) moral ideology. Christians deserve no support because they need no support—we are culturally and ethnically at home. Islam deserves special treatment because it is (in the eyes of the relevant persons) foreign. As much as we might be inclined to fight to get Christianity a seat at the table in the identity regime, this would be a mistake. They are right—Christianity is not an identity. In fact, it deviates on almost every point from the common characteristics of modern identity groups. It is not hereditary. It is not an ethnicity. It can be questioned, and expects to be questioned. It can be dispensed with at any time, for any reason, until one’s dying breath. It is not a feature of Christians’ innate lifestyle tendencies (quite the contrary). It is of a different sort altogether from being a Muslim of Pakistani descent, say, or being a disabled gay veteran. Our society has a different category for Christianity: “religion.” It used to be that “religion” denoted one’s concrete obligations to the divine, or (more narrowly) adherence to vows made before God about one’s way of life. Several centuries of Enlightenment secularism and American political ideals have given the term a different sense. Today, like identity, “religion” and its instances are more or less indefinable, though religions are commonly seen as sharing a few basic features—among them, subjectivity, irrationality, and privacy. If we look back to the early Church, we rarely find people speaking about “religion,” and never about “identity.” Christianity was not a personality attribute for them or a privately held superstition—for the greatest of the Church Fathers, it was nothing other than the perfection and fulfillment of the way of life imagined by Plato and the philosophers. To be a Christian was to be a philosopher, since we share with the philosophers a common goal: to see the face of God. Justin Martyr recognized this, as did Augustine, the Cappadocians, and long list of others. Lately I have been revisiting Plato, and it strikes me that the basic problem of Christianity in the secular workplace is not the selective distribution of “identity” status or the uneven application of liberal principles. Our problem is that we live in a society as hostile to the aims of the philosophical life—a life in pursuit of moral integrity, the truth, and union with God—as was Athens in the time of Socrates. Our fellow citizens do not understand our preference for spiritual goods over material prosperity. They despise us because we disapprove of pleasures everyone else accepts. Chiefly, though, I think they are impatient with our impractical fixation on intangible truths. In Plato’s Gorgias, Callicles gives voice to what I take to be the basic attitude toward Christianity in the modern workplace: My own reaction to grown men who practice philosophy is very much like that to men who lisp and play like children. When I see philosophy in a young lad I approve of it; I think it appropriate and consider such a person well-bred. … But when I see an older man still engaging in philosophy and not giving it up, I think such a man by this time needs a flogging. Such a person, however intelligent he may be, is bound to become unmanly by fleeing the centers of his city and its marketplaces, in which (as the poet said), “men get themselves fame and glory”—instead, he will surely spend the rest of his days muttering in some corner with three or four boys, and never uttering anything well-bred, important, or apt. … Listen to me, my good man, and stop your arguing. Practice the sweet music of an active life, and do it where you’ll get a reputation for intelligence. Elliot Milco is deputy editor of First Things.

Reuters/Neil Hall By A. Ananthalakshmi, Bernardo Vizcaino and Carolyn Cohn KUALA LUMPUR/SYDNEY/LONDON, Aug 19 (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank JPMorgan will include Islamic bonds, or sukuk, in its emerging markets indices for the first time from later this year, widening the appeal of Islamic instruments among global debt investors. JPMorgan, which runs the most widely used benchmarks of emerging market debt, will include eight sukuk across its index family starting Oct. 31. The decision was taken after JPMorgan conducted an annual governance review it said in a research report to clients, and seen by Reuters. Dollar-denominated sukuk from Turkey, Malaysia and Indonesia will be included in JPMorgan's flagship EMBI Global Diversified index, against which an estimated $313 billion in assets is benchmarked. Advertisement The move could help sukuk break away from their traditional buy-and-hold investor base. "Despite having a market size of $200 billion, so far sukuk was seen as an exotic asset class mainly targeted at Islamic banks," said Okan Akin, emerging market credit analyst at AllianceBernstein in London. The decision by JPMorgan would increase the liquidity of sukuk instruments, the lack of which has been the main negative feature of the market, Akin said. Including sukuk into such benchmarks would attract higher bids and may support prices at higher levels, said Anita Yadav, head of fixed income research at Emirates NBD in Dubai. "Non-traditional investors that generally hesitate to invest in sukuk may also be forced to buy should they be using JPMorgan as their performance benchmark," Yadav said. Sukuk, which follow religious principles such as bans on interest and gambling, have their core centres in the Gulf region and Southeast Asia although the funding format has made inroads in Western markets in recent years. TEST FOR REGULATORY REGIME While the inclusion of sukuk will benefit the sector in the short term, the omissions of some names could also encourage regulators to address persistent weaknesses in the sector. To be eligible sukuk must be rated, have their liquidity assessed prior to inclusion in the JPMorgan indices and meet other criteria similar to conventional bonds. At the outset, however, not all issuers might meet such requirements. Only two corporate sukuk will be included in the JPMorgan Corporate Emerging Markets Bond Index: a 2023 sukuk from Dubai's DP World and a 2024 sukuk from the Gulf region's largest utility Saudi Electricity Co . Pakistan's $1 billion sukuk maturing in 2019 will be included in the JPMorgan Asia Credit Index alongside sukuk from Indonesia and Malaysia, but the likes of Qatar and Bahrain are currently absent. Malaysia was the only country to have its local currency sukuk included in JPMorgan's Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets, which comprises higher yielding local debt. Two sukuk from Malaysia maturing in 2023 and 2026 will be included in the GBI-EM index, which is tracked by an estimated $207 billion in assets under management. "We believe this move could boost foreign interest on a gradual basis," said Mohamad Safri Shahul Hamid, deputy chief executive officer of Malaysia's CIMB Islamic Bank. "Active investors will move into markets when they spot opportunities and this would be one of them." Foreign holdings in the two Malaysian sukuk would be expected to increase over the next three to six months due to inclusion in the index, said Winson Phoon, fixed income analyst at Maybank Investment Bank.

Ananthalakshmi, Bernardo Vizcaino and Carolyn Cohn KUALA LUMPUR/SYDNEY/LONDON, Aug 19 (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank JPMorgan will include Islamic bonds, or sukuk, in its emerging markets indices for the first time from later this year, widening the appeal of Islamic instruments among global debt investors. JPMorgan, which runs the most widely used benchmarks of emerging market debt, will include eight sukuk across its index family starting Oct. 31. The decision was taken after JPMorgan conducted an annual governance review it said in a research report to clients, and seen by Reuters. Dollar-denominated sukuk from Turkey, Malaysia and Indonesia will be included in JPMorgan's flagship EMBI Global Diversified index, against which an estimated $313 billion in assets is benchmarked. The move could help sukuk break away from their traditional buy-and-hold investor base. "Despite having a market size of $200 billion, so far sukuk was seen as an exotic asset class mainly targeted at Islamic banks," said Okan Akin, emerging market credit analyst at AllianceBernstein in London. The decision by JPMorgan would increase the liquidity of sukuk instruments, the lack of which has been the main negative feature of the market, Akin said. Including sukuk into such benchmarks would attract higher bids and may support prices at higher levels, said Anita Yadav, head of fixed income research at Emirates NBD in Dubai. "Non-traditional investors that generally hesitate to invest in sukuk may also be forced to buy should they be using JPMorgan as their performance benchmark," Yadav said. Sukuk, which follow religious principles such as bans on interest and gambling, have their core centres in the Gulf region and Southeast Asia although the funding format has made inroads in Western markets in recent years. TEST FOR REGULATORY REGIME While the inclusion of sukuk will benefit the sector in the short term, the omissions of some names could also encourage regulators to address persistent weaknesses in the sector. To be eligible sukuk must be rated, have their liquidity assessed prior to inclusion in the JPMorgan indices and meet other criteria similar to conventional bonds. At the outset, however, not all issuers might meet such requirements. Only two corporate sukuk will be included in the JPMorgan Corporate Emerging Markets Bond Index: a 2023 sukuk from Dubai's DP World and a 2024 sukuk from the Gulf region's largest utility Saudi Electricity Co. Pakistan's $1 billion sukuk maturing in 2019 will be included in the JPMorgan Asia Credit Index alongside sukuk from Indonesia and Malaysia, but the likes of Qatar and Bahrain are currently absent. Malaysia was the only country to have its local currency sukuk included in JPMorgan's Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets, which comprises higher yielding local debt. Two sukuk from Malaysia maturing in 2023 and 2026 will be included in the GBI-EM index, which is tracked by an estimated $207 billion in assets under management. "We believe this move could boost foreign interest on a gradual basis," said Mohamad Safri Shahul Hamid, deputy chief executive officer of Malaysia's CIMB Islamic Bank. "Active investors will move into markets when they spot opportunities and this would be one of them." Foreign holdings in the two Malaysian sukuk would be expected to increase over the next three to six months due to inclusion in the index, said Winson Phoon, fixed income analyst at Maybank Investment Bank.

Corporate headquarters in the Manhattan borough of New York City, May 20, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Segar By Jonathan Stempel JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) on Friday said it will receive $645 million in a settlement of litigation with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) arising from its purchase of Washington Mutual Inc's banking operations during the financial crisis in 2008. According to a regulatory filing, JPMorgan will collect the cash payment from the estate of Washington Mutual Bank, for which the FDIC acts as receiver. In exchange, JP Morgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets said it will drop its more than $1 billion in claims related to the Washington Mutual (WaMu) purchase. JPMorgan also said Deutsche Bank, the trustee overseeing 99 trusts holding residential mortgage securities backed by soured WaMu home loans, will have a claim against the estate. JPMorgan had filed lawsuits seeking to force the FDIC to indemnify it on claims relating to the WaMu purchase, in which it also assumed some of the thrift's liabilities. Deutsche Bank had filed a $10 billion lawsuit against the FDIC and JPMorgan over losses stemming from alleged defects in WaMu's mortgage underwriting. JPMorgan said the settlement requires court approval, and would end four WaMu-related lawsuits involving the bank and the FDIC, and pending in the federal court in Washington, D.C. The bank and the FDIC have long fought over who is liable to investors for claims arising from Seattle-based WaMu's collapse. WaMu had been nation's largest savings and loan before the FDIC seized it on Sept. 25, 2008 and sold its banking operations to New York-based JPMorgan for about $1.9 billion.

Corporate headquarters in the Manhattan borough of New York. Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 6:05 AM, August 20, 2016 Updated: 7:15 AM, August 20, 2016 JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> on Friday said it will receive $645 million in a settlement of litigation with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and Deutsche Bank AG <DBKGn.DE> arising from its purchase of Washington Mutual Inc's banking operations during the financial crisis in 2008. According to a regulatory filing, JPMorgan will collect the cash payment from the estate of Washington Mutual Bank, for which the FDIC acts as receiver. In exchange, JP Morgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets said it will drop its more than $1 billion in claims related to the Washington Mutual (WaMu) purchase. JPMorgan also said Deutsche Bank, the trustee overseeing 99 trusts holding residential mortgage securities backed by soured WaMu home loans, will have a claim against the estate. JPMorgan had filed lawsuits seeking to force the FDIC to indemnify it on claims relating to the WaMu purchase, in which it also assumed some of the thrift's liabilities. Deutsche Bank had filed a $10 billion lawsuit against the FDIC and JPMorgan over losses stemming from alleged defects in WaMu's mortgage underwriting. JPMorgan said the settlement requires court approval, and would end four WaMu-related lawsuits involving the bank and the FDIC, and pending in the federal court in Washington, D.C. The bank and the FDIC have long fought over who is liable to investors for claims arising from Seattle-based WaMu's collapse. WaMu had been nation's largest savings and loan before the FDIC seized it on Sept. 25, 2008 and sold its banking operations to New York-based JPMorgan for about $1.9 billion. The parent holding company of WaMu filed for bankruptcy protection. FDIC spokesman David Barr and Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Oksana Poltavets declined to comment. The FDIC's full name is the .

This, however, might not suffice to make it a high performer on Dalal Street, going by global experience. Globally, there seems to be a negative correlation between a bank's size (in assets) and its stock performance. Most of the world's biggest banks in terms of assets — Mitsubishi UFJ, JPMorgan Chase, BNP Paribas, Bank of America, Citi Group, Deutsche Bank, Barclays — have been gross underperformers on the bourses in both the past year and three years. Most of them witnessed a decline in their share price and market capitalisation, despite a global rally in equities. For example, the stock price of Mitsubushi UFJ — currently the world's top bank outside China, in terms of assets — is down 40 per cent over the past 12 months and gave a negative annualised return of 1.4 per cent in the past three years. At the end of March, it had total assets of $2.65 trillion, nearly six times that of SBI, which tops the list in India with assets of around $450 billion. The analysis is based on a list of 40 banks from North America, Europe, Japan and the Asia-Pacific. The sample is based on the peer group definition of Bloomberg. Similarly, Mitsubishi's peers in Western Europe and North America are underperforming on the bourses. For example, Europe's biggest bank, BNP Paribas, has given a negative return of 24 per cent in the past year and a negative annualised return of 2.2 per cent in the past three years. Deutsche Bank, the top one in Germany, has been the biggest laggard, falling 57 per cent in the past 12 months and having given a negative 26.5 per cent annualised return in the past three years. In comparison, most of the smaller banks in the sample have given double-digit returns to their shareholders in the past year and high single digit returns in the past three years. In America, JPMorgan Chase seems an exception and has done reasonably well, despite its large size. The bank has given double-digit return to shareholders in the past three years and its stock price has been stable in the past 12 months. In SBI's case, most analysts are bullish on the stock and see synergy gains from the merger in the long term. However, they point to the immediate cost. Aashish Agarwal of CLSA writes the synergy gains are likely to accrue only in the medium to long term. "First, the alignment of non-performing loans' (NPLs') recognition of subsidiaries with the parent will push up their NPL and credit costs, leading to losses during the first quarter of the current fiscal. Second, as per management, there will be a one-time pension cost of around Rs 3,000 crore for employees of subsidiary banks," he writes on the merger. SBI will also have to bear an additional cost of Rs 25 crore a month (Rs 300 crore a year) for the change in salary structure of the associate banks. In comparison, the SBI management estimates synergy gains of around Rs 3,500 crore from merging and aligning the operations of subsidiary banks with itself. However, while the cost from the merger is real, the upfront gain is contingent on smooth and effective integration. A failure to juice out the gains that outweigh the cost could hit the stock in the medium to longer term.

The result was dragged down by a heavy write-down on the company's new liquefied natural gas project in Queensland that it flagged earlier this week. The GLNG venture shipped its first cargo from Gladstone last year.  Before the impairment, the underlying result was also a loss, of $US5 million, a smaller deficit than some analysts had anticipated. JPMorgan analyst Mark Busuttil described the result as "decent", but said it would likely be overshadowed by the large impairment. Santos shares wavered in reaction to the report, but were flat at $4.95 in early afternoon trading. Sales slid 6 per cent to $US1.19 billion even as output rose 10 per cent to 31.1 million barrels of oil equivalent, boosted by the start-up of the GLNG project in Gladstone.  New chief executive Kevin Gallagher said Santos was making "good progress" towards the goal of reducing the point at which it breaks even on a cash flow basis to $US35-$US40 a barrel, to better cope with weak oil prices. Advertisement But he said there was "a lot of work ahead of us" to further drive down costs and reduce debt. JPMorgan analyst noted that Santos's cash breakeven point "remains high", at close to $US44 a barrel. Yet Mr Gallagher, who joined the company earlier this year, said he was confident the company was "taking the right steps to ensure Santos becomes a strong and sustainable business." "The establishment of the new operating model for Santos will lift productivity and drive long-term value for shareholders in a low oil price environment," he said. Santos's revised dividend policy makes a payout as a ratio of underlying earnings and the company said that, in line with that, the board decided not to pay a dividend for the June half. Santos advised earlier this week it would write down the value of GLNG, which started production last year and is still ramping up, by $US1.05 billion after tax. Impairments of $US11 million after tax were also recorded on other assets in the half. Net debt fell by $US200 million to $US4.5 billion, mostly thanks to the sale of the Kipper project offshore Victoria. Santos noted that not of its existing lending arrangements involve credit rating related covenant triggers or review events. Santos is rated BBB-, the lowest investment grade, by Standard & Poor's. Guidance for full-year output was retained at 57 million-63 million boe, and the guidance for production costs has been reduced, to $US9-$US10 per barrel. After changing its reporting currency from Australian dollars to US dollars, Santos restated its results for the first half of last year, when it made a net profit of $US30 million.

The point at which the drama became inevitable, though—the crossroads on the way to Thebes—came two years earlier, in the summer of 2006. That August house prices in America, which had been rising almost without interruption for as long as anyone could remember, began to fall—a fall that went on for 31 months (see chart 1). In early 2007 mortgage defaults spiked and a mounting panic gripped Wall Street. The money markets dried up as banks became too scared to lend to each other. The lenders with the largest losses and smallest capital buffers began to topple. Thebes fell to the plague. Ten years on, and America’s banks have been remade to withstand such disasters. When Jamie Dimon, the boss of JPMorgan Chase, talks of its “fortress” balance-sheet, he has a point. The banking industry’s core capital is now $1.2 trillion, more than double its pre-crisis level. In order to grind out enough profits to satisfy their shareholders, banks have slashed costs and increased prices; their return on equity has edged back towards 10%. America’s lenders are still widely despised, but they are now in reasonable shape: highly capitalised, fairly profitable, in private hands and subject to market discipline. The trouble is that, in America, the banks are only part of the picture. There is a huge, parallel structure that exists outside the banks and which creates almost as much credit as they do: the mortgage system. In stark contrast to the banks it is very badly capitalised (see chart 2). It is also barely profitable, largely nationalised and subject to administrative control. That matters. At $26 trillion America’s housing stock is the largest asset class in the world, worth a little more than the country’s stockmarket. America’s mortgage-finance system, with $11 trillion of debt, is probably the biggest concentration of financial risk to be found anywhere. It is still closely linked to the global financial system, with $1 trillion of mortgage debt owned abroad. It has not gone unreformed in the ten years since it set off the most severe recession of modern times. But it remains fundamentally flawed. The strange path the mortgage machine has taken has implications for ordinary people, as well as for financiers. The supply of mortgages in America has an air of distinctly socialist command-and-control about it. Some 65-80% of all new home loans are repackaged by organs of the state. The structure of these loans, their volume and the risks they entail are controlled not by markets but by administrative fiat. No one is keen to make transparent the subsidies and dangers involved, the risks of which are in effect borne by taxpayers. But an analysis by The Economist suggests that the subsidy for housing debt is running at about $150 billion a year, or roughly 1% of GDP. A crisis as bad as last time would cost taxpayers 2-4% of GDP, not far off the bail-out of the banks in 2008-12. America’s housing system has always been unusual. In most countries banks minimise their risk by offering short-term or floating-rate mortgages. American borrowers get a better deal: cheap 30-year fixed-rate mortgages that can be repaid early free. These generous terms are made possible by the support of a housing-finance machine that funnels cheap credit to homeowners and, in doing so, takes on the risk, thereby shielding both the borrowers and the investors. For decades lightly regulated thrifts did most of this lending. But in the 1980s they blew up due to a mixture of risky lending, inadequate capital and bad bets on interest rates. Between 1986 and 1996, over 1,000 thrifts were bailed out at a cost to taxpayers of about 3% of one year’s GDP. The vacuum left by the thrifts was filled by the new technology of securitisation, which seemed, for a while, to make the risk vanish altogether. There are several steps. Mortgages are originated, or agreed, with millions of homeowners. The loans thus underwritten are then spruced up to look more attractive or realise some profits; for example sometimes insurance may be taken out against defaults, or the rights to “service” loans (collect interest payments) sold off. Next the loans are guaranteed and securitised. The bundles of bonds thus produced are then flogged to investors. After all this, derivatives contracts are created whose value is linked to these bonds. The machine blew up in 2006-10 for a host of reasons, the most important of which was wild and sometimes fraudulent underwriting. There was a run on mortgage bonds and on the firms that issued or owned them. There have since been three big changes.  The trouble with Gosplan First, banks have partially withdrawn from the mortgage game after facing swathes of new rules and $110 billion of fines for misconduct. They still own mortgage-backed bonds and they still make home loans to wealthy folk, which they keep on their balance-sheets. But with the exception of Wells Fargo they are less keen on writing riskier loans in their branches and feeding them to securitisers. New, independent firms like Quicken Loans and Freedom Mortgage have filled the gap. They originate roughly half of all new mortgages. The second big change is that the government’s improvised rescue of the system in 2008-12 has left it with a much bigger role (see chart 3). It is the majority shareholder in Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, mortgage companies that were previously privately run (though with an implicit guarantee). They are now in “conservatorship”, a type of notionally temporary nationalisation that shows few signs of ending. Other private securitisers have withdrawn or gone bust. This means that the securitisation of loans, most of which used to be in the private sector, is now almost entirely state-run. Along with Fannie and Freddie, the other main players are the Veterans Affairs department (VA), the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Ginnie Mae, which helps the FHA and VA package loans into bonds and sell them. In all, these five bodies own or have guaranteed $6.4 trillion of loans: a book of exposure three times larger than Mr Dimon’s balance-sheet. The FHA, an agency tasked with promoting home ownership, has tripled its guarantee book since the crisis. The mortgage bonds into which these entities bundle their loans are perceived by investors to be almost as safe as Treasuries; though they charge a fee for this protection, it is far lower than that which private companies that do not benefit from the backing of the state would have to charge if they were taking on the same risks. Thus they face no competition. The last big change is the withering of the derivatives superstructure. The baroque instruments of the 2003-07 bubble, such as CDOs, CLOs and swaps on the ABX Index, have been stripped back after huge losses: trading activity has fallen by 90%. The mortgage machine is safer as a result. But even shorn of this amplifying mechanism, the machine is still connected to the broader world of global finance. American banks own 23% of all government mortgage bonds. American officials who served during the crisis tell war stories about trying to persuade their counterparts in China and elsewhere not to dump all their mortgage bonds. As a result of their efforts foreign central banks, private banks and financial firms still hold 15% of all mortgage bonds; Barclays’ mortgage-bond holdings are worth 22% of the bank’s core capital. The rest are mainly owned by domestic investment funds and the Federal Reserve which, due to its asset-purchasing scheme, holds $1.8 trillion of government mortgage bonds, or 27% of the total. This new credit machine has plenty of flaws. Almost everyone in the business worries that regulation of the new mortgage originators which funnel loans to the government-guarantee firms is too loose, for example; supervisors are looking at tightening up. But the biggest issue is the danger that sits with the state-run securitisers that magically transform risky mortgages into risk-free bonds. With a dearth of reliable market signals and a diminished profit motive, the risk appetite of the mortgage system is now entirely controlled by administrative fiat. There are at least 10,000 relevant pages of federal laws, regulatory orders and rule books. These are meant to prevent another blow-up by screening out undesirable loans before securitisation. They stipulate the profile of the borrower (a debt-servicing-to-income ratio of more than 43% is a poor lookout) and, indeed, the dimensions of the house (if prefabricated, it must be at least 12 feet, or 3.6 metres, across). They define the documentation required. They specify the design of mortgages: balloon payments (whereby repayment of the principal is pushed back to the end of the loan period) are a no-no, as are some fee structures. They impose rules on counterparties: mortgage insurers, for example, must have over $400m of assets at hand. Although there are no government quotas for the volume of new loans there are soft targets. Like water through cracks, risk still finds a way in. Federal law is silent on loan-to-value limits for borrowers, so this is one area where risky lending is booming, with a fifth of all loans granted since 2012 having LTV ratios of 95%, meaning homeowners are underwater if house prices fall by more than 5%. Most of these sit with the FHA. One big bank admits that it is selling at face value high-risk loans to the government that it expects will make a 10-15% loss due to homeowners defaulting. My indecision is final And all such rules are vulnerable to political pressure. Home-ownership rates have dropped to about 63% from a peak of 69% (see chart 4); many housing experts talk of an affordability crisis among the young and minorities. With Congress gridlocked and likely to remain so after the election, the mortgage machine is a largely off-balance-sheet way to funnel money to ordinary Americans, most of whom still want to own homes. Just as underwriting standards in the private sector gradually loosened over time before 2007, there are gentle signs of loosening evident today, too—rules on down-payments, for example, have been relaxed. Not yet frightening; but it never is, to begin with. All the new rules are silent on the mortgage system’s purpose. One potential justification is simply to facilitate a liquid mortgage-bond market. By acting as a common guarantor, the state can ensure that mortgage bonds are homogenous and easy to trade ($220 billion-worth change hands every day). Another is to subsidise home loans for a broader political or social purpose. In the absence of a grand design or clear political direction, the mortgage machine has assumed both roles. One response to the new mortgage system is to leave it be. After all, the previous approach, in which private securitisers played a bigger role, was a disaster. Household debt is relatively restrained at the moment; measured by debt-service-to-income ratios it is 10% below the long-term average. Based on the post-war experience, housing-debt crises come only every 25 years or so; it is not yet time to worry about another one. Leaving aside its fundamental irresponsibility, a course of inaction carries hard-to-quantify costs in the form of subsidies for borrowers. The securitisation industry believes there are reasons for not holding it to the same standard as the banks. But imagine that it were: that it had to carry the same level of capital as banks do and to make an adequate (10%) post-tax profit on that capital. The higher costs entailed give a sense of the scale of the current distortion. On this basis The Economist calculates the subsidy on mortgages to be running at $150 billion a year, 1% of GDP. (This estimate includes the impact of the Fed’s bond-buying on interest rates and the cost of tax breaks on mortgage-interest payments.) And the status quo also means that, in the event of another crash, taxpayers would be landed with a big bill. How big? Consider a spectrum of scenarios. At one end, the cumulative mortgage-system losses are 10%, the same as the actual losses in 2006-14 according to estimates by Mark Zandi of Moody’s Analytics. At the other, cumulative losses on all mortgages are assumed to be 4.4%—the level the Fed used in its stress tests of the banks in May 2016. Adjusting for the pockets of capital in the system, and the profits made by some parts of it, both of which can help absorb losses, this means that the total loss for taxpayers if another crisis strikes would be $300 billion-600 billion, or 2-4% of GDP. Most of this would fall on Fannie, Freddie and the FHA, which would need to draw money from the government to pay out on the insurance claims made by investors. Such a bill would hardly bankrupt America. But it would enrage it again. It is similar in size to the $700 billion TARP bail-out that Congress reluctantly passed in 2008. Lawmakers might be unwilling to pay for a repeat performance, especially with some of the benefit going abroad—and the mere possibility of their not stumping up would set the world’s financial markets a-jitter. If Congress signed off, a populist president might still be able to scupper the deal; the credit line through which Fannie and Freddie would be paid is governed by a contract between the Treasury and their regulator that comes under the executive. The catastrophic impact that a mortgage-bond default would have on the markets would almost certainly serve to ensure that the politicians did, indeed, act. But the capacity of American politics to disregard what used to seem almost certain is on the up these days. How to waste a crisis There is an alternative approach: force the mortgage machine to follow the same path the banks have. It would have to recapitalise and raise its fees enough to offer an acceptable profit on that capital. The subsidy would fall. Administrative controls could be eased. The risk of loss could be passed into private hands, either by privatising the mortgage-securitisation firms or by allowing them to shrink, with private banks and insurers now able to compete on a level playing field. Using the same approach as the Fed’s bank-stress tests, the system would need about $400 billion of capital. The cost of American mortgages would rise by about one percentage point. There are various proposals for reducing the government’s role in the system; the White House floated several in 2013, and there is a range of reform bills floating around Congress, the best of which is known as Corker-Warner. But no one is in a hurry to pass reforms that would result in higher mortgage rates at a time when the middle class is struggling. A lot of policy discussions obfuscate the basic issues, assuming either that mortgages are now much safer than they were in the past or that the mortgage-guarantee firms can be safer than the banks even though not subject to the same stringent capital rules. The government has pragmatic reasons to procrastinate. The coupons it gets on money loaned to Fannie and Freddie count as income but their debt doesn’t end up on its books; that provides a nice fillip for the accounts. The status quo also lets it avoid confronting a noisy group of hedge funds taking legal action over the treatment of Fannie’s and Freddie’s shareholders in the bail-out. If the government were to recapitalise or restructure the mortgage firms, it would probably need to reach a settlement with the hedge funds or defeat them. To be fair, some parts of the mortgage system are trying to find ways to push risks on to the private sector. Fannie and Freddie have written new “risk sharing” deals that take a slice of the risk on about $850 billion of bonds, and package it into securities that are sold to investors or swap contracts with reinsurance firms. But even if these measures did not look a little too like some of the opaque instruments that blew up in 2007-08 to be entirely comforting, they would be no substitute for proper reform. So the trigger for the most recent crisis remains the part of the global financial system that has been least reformed. Mortgages are still the place where many of America’s deepest problems meet—an addiction to debt, the use of hidden subsidies to mitigate inequality, and political gridlock. In the land of the free, where home ownership is a national dream, borrowing to buy a house is a government business for which taxpayers are on the hook. twitter icon facebook icon more iconMore linkedin icon googleplus icon mail icon print icon purchase-rights icon View comments (40) Editors’ picks Protest and lose your passportTo silence dissidents, Gulf states are revoking their citizenship Many are left stateless as a result Britain’s youngAre they screwed?

At the beginning of this year, bearish views of developing economies were all the rage. As recently as May, shorting (selling securities prior to buying them with the aim of making a profit when their price falls) emerging markets was still one of the most crowded trades, according to a monthly survey published by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Yet over the past several months, especially since the end of June, investors have unwound their bearish bets on emerging markets and poured money into their foreign-exchange, equity and bond markets in search of higher returns amid a collapse in interest rates in many developed nations. The shift in investor sentiment has been dramatic. According to a separate survey published by Bank of America Merrill Lynch last month, fixed-income investors now have a small overweight position in emerging-market currencies. Emerging market equities tipped as new darlings of investment This is not surprising, given that emerging-market foreign exchange has been one of the best-performing asset classes this year, with nearly half the gains occurring since the end of June when Britain voted to leave the European Union. The Brexit vote triggered a further decline in bond yields in advanced economies, with those in Europe and Japan falling deeper into negative territory, increasing the appeal of higher-yielding emerging-market assets. According to JPMorgan, inflows into emerging-market bond funds have “outpaced inflows into risk assets elsewhere”, reaching US$17 billion since the start of July, with last month’s US$13.5 billion in inflows representing the largest monthly inflow since the bank began tracking subscriptions to debt funds in developing economies. Even more remarkably, flows to emerging-market equity funds (which last year suffered huge outflows totalling US$64 billion) this year have now moved into positive territory following six weeks of large inflows, according to JPMorgan. The Brexit vote triggered a further decline in bond yields in advanced economies, increasing the appeal of higher-yielding emerging-market assets Yet it is emerging-market currencies, which last year bore the brunt of the deterioration in sentiment towards developing economies as oil prices continued to fall, that have been the greatest beneficiaries of the other main reason behind the rally in emerging-market assets: the weakness of the US dollar amid expectations that US interest rates are unlikely to rise further this year. On Tuesday, the dollar index fell a further 0.7 per cent, taking its decline over the past month to nearly 3 per cent and causing the yen to flirt with the psychologically important level of 100 yen to the dollar. The weaker dollar is providing support to commodity prices amid renewed hopes among investors of a freeze in production by members of the Opec oil cartel. Oil prices, having fallen sharply last month, have shot up 17.5 per cent this month, easing the strain on the developing world’s vulnerable energy exporters such as Russia and Malaysia. JPMorgan even believes “the worst of the emerging-market fundamental downturn has passed”, with economic growth expected to pick up slightly in the second half of this year, underpinned by a stabilisation in oil prices and loose monetary policy. Still, emerging markets are by no means out of the woods. The rally stems partly from expectations that the Federal Reserve will eschew a “hawkish surprise” by raising rates earlier than expected. Yet on Tuesday, William Dudley, a prominent Fed policymaker, said bond markets were “complacent” about the scope for further rate rises, warning that borrowing costs could increase as early as next month. The fact that markets sold off immediately following his comments shows the degree of uncertainty surrounding the conduct of US monetary policy. Fed admits it triggered emerging markets sell-off but says some countries' policies made them vulnerable On Wednesday, futures markets were assigning a nearly 50 per cent probability to a rate rise by the end of this year, the highest odds since early June. Secondly, a fresh burst of political risk is likely to weigh on market sentiment as the US presidential election campaign enters its final stretch in the run-up to the vote on November 8. While Donald Trump, the populist Republican candidate, is now trailing Hillary Clinton, his Democratic counterpart, in the polls, a Trump victory is still possible. Finally, emerging-market economies are hardly roaring back to life. The Latin American region will contract this year, Russia is still in recession and China’s economy continues to slow as it struggles to rebalance away from investment. Emerging-market bulls should not get carried away.

Business Catholic Health system gets financial breathing room with $1 billion bond sale Michael Englehart Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune President and CEO of Presence Health Michael Englehart at the company's headquarters in downtown Chicago on March 16, 2016. President and CEO of Presence Health Michael Englehart at the company's headquarters in downtown Chicago on March 16, 2016. (Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune) Peter Matuszak and Lisa SchenckerContact ReporterChicago Tribune Presence Health has closed on a $1 billion bond sale — the largest deal of its kind in Illinois — in an effort to shore up the Catholic health system's financial fitness following large operating losses last year. The deal provides a big dose of assistance to the Chicago-based, 11-hospital system, enabling it to refinance its debt while it tries to right its operations. Facilitated by the Illinois Finance Authority, the deal is the largest BBB-rated, not-for-profit health care transaction ever sold in this sector of the municipal market, according to JPMorgan Chase, the deal's underwriter. Presence President and CEO Michael Englehart said in a news release the system was excited with how well its bond offering was received. "This was a clear indication that our investors have full confidence that our turnaround plan is working, we have the right executive team in place, we are engaging the right industry experts, and we are carefully reviewing and restructuring our functional processes," Englehart said. Presence declined to make Englehart available for an interview Wednesday. A spokesman, Robert Scarola, would not elaborate on what the health system specifically planned to do to increase revenue and whether it planned additional layoffs. Presence, the largest Illinois-based Catholic health system with hospitals stretching from Evanston to Urbana, has been working on a turnaround after facing a series of challenges in recent years. Catholic health system makes progress in turnaround plan Ameet Sachdev Presence Health's shaky financial condition has taken a slight turn for the better after the Catholic health system reduced its workforce by more than 650 full-time jobs and increased prices in the first half of the year. But it's too early to say whether the Chicago-based company is on the road... Presence Health's shaky financial condition has taken a slight turn for the better after the Catholic health system reduced its workforce by more than 650 full-time jobs and increased prices in the first half of the year. But it's too early to say whether the Chicago-based company is on the road... (Ameet Sachdev) In 2015, Presence lost more than $185 million on operations, compared with a loss of $12.7 million in 2014. Several credit-rating agencies this year downgraded the system's bond rating, which can affect a company's ability to borrow money. Among the debt that will be refinanced is a $528.1 million short-term loan the system got from JPMorgan Chase earlier this year. That loan was intended to buy the system time to restructure its debt. Remaining bonds from Presence's predecessors, Resurrection Health Care and Provena Health, also were refinanced as part of the deal, totaling $223.1 million and $286.8 million, respectively. The refinancing deal is facilitated by conduit bonds that the IFA issues on behalf of qualified non-for-profit organizations. Presence Health pledged operating revenue to repay the bonds, a bill that will total $1.7 billion, including $719.1 million in interest through 2041, according to bond documents. If Presence were to default on its payments, bondholders could seek to recoup their investment only by pursuing the health system's assets. Neither the IFA nor state taxpayers would be responsible for covering the cost, as the authority serves only as a conduit for the financial transaction. Christopher Meister, executive director of the IFA, said the agency was happy to be of help to Presence "in this important transaction for the people of Illinois and the state's community health." Conduit bonds allow not-for-profits to obtain much lower rates through tax-exempt bonds than would be available by taking out traditional bank loans or issuing commercial paper. According to a statement issued by Presence Health after the deal closed, the refunding bonds received an average fixed interest rate of 3.88 percent. Refinancing all of Presence's outstanding debt should give it a measure of financial breathing room. The $1 billion refunding bond includes interest-only payments for several years. Principal repayment begins in 2020. In all, the new bond deal is expected to save the health system $49 million based in current dollars over the life of the loan, according to Presence. "With lower interest expense costs reduced, this gives us greater ability to deliver upon our strategy to improve operations and build on our platform of high quality patient experience," Scarola said in an emailed statement. He said, for example, the system will continue reviewing operations such as clinical documentation. The system has started making progress on its finances. Earlier this year, it reduced its workforce by 650 full-time positions and increased prices. Following those actions, Presence's income from operations improved from a loss of $9 million in January to a profit of $1.1 million in June, according to an unaudited financial statement released last month. Although the focus of the $1 billion loan was to refinance debt, Presence used $117 million of the proceeds to reimburse recent capital investments, according to the bond documents. The capital reimbursement is for routine maintenance activities performed across the system over the past 18 months, Scarola said in a statement. Investors paid premiums totaling $87.2 million in order to secure interest rates on the bonds of 4 percent or 5 percent for most of the maturities. After accounting for the additional money provided upfront, the bonds averaged a yield of 3.88 percent. Combined with funds previously deposited for repayment of the old bonds, $122.2 million in additional funding was added to the $1 billion bond sale. According to the bond disclosures for the deal, a small portion of the short-term loan from JPMorgan Chase may not be refinanced using the bond funds. pmatuszak@chicagotribune.com lschencker@chicagotribune.com Twitter @petermatuszak Twitter @lschencker An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Illinois taxpayers might be obligated to help pay the cost of the debt if Presence defaulted on its payments. The Illinois Finance Authority serves only as a conduit for these bonds, and the state makes no pledge to cover any financial loss suffered by investors.

Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website 8  −   =  4 Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter General Motors Headquarters, Detroit, Michigan, 2006 The new millennium brought with it the five largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings in U.S. history. The past decade has seen four of those alone, brought on by – you guessed it – the 2008 stock market crash. With the help of Uncle Sam or a competitor firm, some of these corporations were able to continue operating. Others were not so lucky. Here's a look at the five largest Chapter 11 bankruptcies in U.S. history, including the cause of their epic downfalls and how much they were worth at filing… The Five Largest Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Filings in U.S. History Largest Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Filing in U.S. History No. 5: CIT Group Inc. (NYSE: CIT) CIT group is a financial holding company that provides capital to middle-market business clients and their customers in more than 30 separate industries. Seven years ago, the company nearly bit the dust after the 2008 financial crisis. You see, on Nov. 2, 2009, CIT filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It had $71 billion in assets at the time, making it one of the largest-ever corporate bankruptcy filings in U.S. history. On the day CIT filed for the protection, its share price fell to $0.25, down 94% from its 2009 high of $4.58. CIT also received the not-so-glamorous award of being the first firm to fail after being bailed out by the U.S. government for $2.3 billion that year, which meant that massive inoculation of cash from Uncle Sam and taxpayers was all for naught. Exposed: The real reason Congress gets nothing done isn't partisan gridlock. It's that the primary duty of our elected representatives is no longer making laws. Here are their new priorities… However, by April 2013, CIT had repaid or refinanced $31 billion of its debt. Share prices climbed 58% that year, and the firm repurchased $200 million of its own stock. Today (Aug. 16), CIT stock is worth $35.22 a share – up 13,988% from November 2009. Largest Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Filing in U.S. History No. 4: General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM) The 108-year-old automaker filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June 2009. The value of its assets was $91 billion at the time. But GM suffered from lousy auto sales well before the Great Recession. Former Chief Executive Rick Wagoner launched a restructuring plan for GM in 2004, but the company still lost nearly $90 billion in the five years between the plan's initiation and the company's bankruptcy filing. In June 2009, the U.S. government agreed to provide GM with another $30 billion in aid, in addition to $20 billion the automaker had already borrowed. In return, Uncle Sam got a controlling stake in the company. As did Uncle Canuck – the Canadian government put up $9.5 billion in order to obtain a 12.5% stake of GM. The government-funded bailout worked. In Q1 2013, the automaker posted better than expected profits of $1.18 billion. On Dec. 20, 2013, GM's share price was $40.99, up 60% from where it sat once it had resumed trading again on Aug. 12, 2011, at $25.75. Today's GM share price is $31.86. Editor's Note: This General Motors rival is currently building what could be the world's "smartest" car, and no is paying much attention… which means there's a profit to be made… Largest Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Filing in U.S. History No. 3: WorldCom WorldCom was once a long-distance provider that started in 1983. It filed for bankruptcy in July 2002. With assets worth around $104 billion at the time and a debt load at $41 billion, its filing marked the largest corporate bankruptcy ever — until the Great Recession. The telecommunications company was caught up in the middle of a scandal, caused by accounting fraud — in fact, WorldCom is No. 2 on our list of the five biggest corporate scandals in U.S. history, here. In sum, the month before it filed for Chapter 11 protection – in June 2002 – WorldCom admitted it had "incorrectly" accounted for $3.8 billion in operating expenses. Few experts or officials expected WorldCom's service to deteriorate noticeably at the time, reported The New York Times on July 22, 2002. That was in spite of the fact its executives were under suspicion of (and eventually pleaded guilty to) fraud charges, with CEO Bernard Ebbers sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2005. WorldCom did deteriorate, though. Twenty-one months after it filed for Chapter 11 protection, the firm changed its name to MCI. The bankruptcy process allowed MCI to dramatically pare its debt down from $41 billion to about $6 billion. But regardless of the optimistic outlook, the rebranded company had yet to pay $36 million towards former employees' severance packages that it had agreed to cough up in October 2002. When MCI was later acquired by Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ) in February 2005, lawsuits pertaining to these unpaid packages were still open. These employees eventually tried to unionize to get their money back — but didn't even get recognition for bargaining power until August 2008. Finally, in October 2009, former MCI/WorldCom employees reached a $3.5 million settlement with their one-time employer, right smack in the middle of the financial crisis. Now, here's a chart that shows how much the top two largest Chapter 11 bankruptcies in U.S. history absolutely dwarf the others — both in terms of asset value and damage to global markets they wrought… Join the conversation.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Aug 19, 2016 at 2:05PM Any way you cut it, Rockwell Medical (NASDAQ:RMTI) stock is having a rocky year. With little revenue to support it, and no profits whatsoever, this small-cap biopharmaceuticals maker is largely subject to the whims of investors who either love it or hate it -- or both, depending on the day of the week. Right now, these investors have sold short 19% of Rockwell's float. And so, down 23% year to date, and down 37% over the past 12 months, Rockwell Medical stock rides the rollercoaster of investor sentiment. But the good news for shareholders is that this sentiment may soon take a turn for the better. This morning, analysts at San Francisco-based institutional broker BTIG began advising their clients to buy Rockwell Medical stock. Says the analyst, Rockwell shares that cost just $7 and change today could hit $12 within a year -- a 45% profit. But is BTIG right about that? Here are three things you need to know. What's the prognosis for Rockwell Medical stock? Image source: Getty Images. 1. BTIG? Who dat? It's not exactly a household name on the order of a JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs, but BTIG is one of the better analysts we track here at Motley Fool CAPS. Ranked in the top 30% of investors, BTIG sports an accuracy rating of 50% on its picks -- which isn't great -- but a record of outperforming the market by more than 20 percentage points per pick on average. So when BTIG is right about a stock, it can be very right indeed. 2. And why does BTIG like Rockwell Medical stock? Now here's what BTIG has to say about Rockwell Medical, as reported on the pages of StreetInsider.com this morning: "RMTI's lead asset, Triferic, has the potential to replace IV iron in hemodialysis patients. Although there is a near-term delay in Triferic ramp-up due to pursuing transitional add-on reimbursement, we view the effort as worthwhile, given the added incentive for dialysis providers." Currently, Rockwell Medical does about $50 million selling Triferic (marketed as an iron replacement drug for dialysis patients) and other biopharmaceuticals for treating end-stage renal disease, chronic kidney disease, and similar conditions. Over time, however, BTIG sees the market for Triferic expanding, to the extent that the analyst predicts "peak sales of $180M+" for that drug. Additionally, the analyst sees peak sales of Calcitriol (for calcium replacement) hitting $48 million or more, eventually. 3. Valuing Rockwell Medical Currently valued at $375 million in market cap, Rockwell Medical stock sells for about 6.7 times its trailing sales. To put that in context, Baxter International (NYSE:BAX), a Rockwell partner in distributing Triferic, costs just 2.6 times sales -- and Baxter is already profitable, and growing its profits in the double digits (which Rockwell Medical is not). On the other hand, if BTIG is right about the end game for Rockwell, then adding up all the revenue streams, it looks like the company could eventually produce revenue in excess of $280 million ($180 million from Triferic, $50 million-ish from Calcitriol, and $50 million more from the company's "base business."). If and when that happens, today's valuation of $375 million would work out to just 1.3 times sales -- half the valuation at Baxter -- and Rockwell Medical stock could begin looking very cheap indeed. One final thing Is this scenario realistic? My fellow Fool Keith Speights has his doubts, recently pointing out that even after Rockwell got Triferic approved by the FDA, it took the company eight more months to actually bring the product to market -- which doesn't speak well of the company's efficiency. " Moreover, multiple legal firms," says Keith, are suing Rockwell for "potential misrepresentations" to investors, which raises doubts about how much we can rely upon the company's promises. And of course, there's there are the following nagging details to worry about: No matter how bright Rockwell and BTIG say its prospects may be, currently, the company is generating just $56 million in annual sales, losing more than $18 million annually on those sales, and burning cash at the rate of more than $13 million a year (according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data). All of these are facts that could give investors pause, as well. Meanwhile, most analysts who follow the stock see Rockwell's sales peaking in 2018, and at not the $280 million level that BTIG suggests, but at just $121 million, and then falling off sharply thereafter. If that's the way things end up working out, then BTIG's recommendation to buy Rockwell Medical stock today could be setting up investors for a very big fall.

Jon Marino | @JonMarino Friday, 19 Aug 2016 | 8:00 AM ETCNBC.com SHARES European Union banks just can't catch a break. Many of them are still slogging uphill to recoup share price losses incurred from the Brexit vote in the U.K. European investment banking revenue overall is down 23 percent this year compared with the same period in 2015, according to data tracker Dealogic. And all are lagging behind U.S. banks for wallet share, or how much revenue they take in from dealmaking compared to competitors. JPMorgan Chase tops every bank in the EU for wallet share, with 7.3 percent of deals, according to data from Dealogic this week. It's followed by Goldman Sachs, which has 6.2 percent of deals, and only then, in third place, is an EU bank: Deutsche Bank has 5 percent of revenue on European mergers and acquisitions. But European banks (and their American counterparts) are fighting off a rising tide of boutique banks that have taken a growing percentage of M&A revenue from them over the last decade. Getty Images German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande (L) and European Union Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. Around the world, M&A levels have declined from recent record highs. But the pain is exacerbated in Europe, where big banks experienced a steeper drop off in revenue. Dealogic data show that investment banking in Germany, for example, is down 45 percent. Globally, European deals account for just 22 percent of banking revenue, the lowest margin since Dealogic began tracking investment banking wallet share. That comes in the wake of banks being hit especially hard on concerns about elevated loan losses, especially those coming from oil and gas assets. But there is one small silver lining for EU banks. The European Central Bank's decision to ramp up bond buying means Europe's banks may find themselves working on more debt deals that juice their top line. So even if EU banks are stuck fighting off their American counterparts for M&A deals, they have another lever to pull to generate more cash. Correction: European investment banking revenue overall is down this year compared with the same period in 2015. An earlier version misstated the time frame.
