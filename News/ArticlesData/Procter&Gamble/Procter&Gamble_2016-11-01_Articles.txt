(Photo/China Daily) Global household and consumer products giant Procter & Gamble Co said it is making a drive to introduce into the Chinese market more high-tech and premium hygiene products for Whisper, its female-care range, to speed up the brand's focus on more lucrative premium products. Hesham Tohamy, president of Greater China Feminine Care, said Chinese women are now very demanding about quality and are willing to pay more to get better quality. "That's why Whisper is innovating and bringing (new) technologies into every lineup of our products," he said. "Chinese consumers' expectations of high-quality products are the fastest-growing around the world," said Tohamy. He added that the company would speed up the introduction of advanced technologies and premium products in China and manufacture products tailored for Chinese clients to satisfy their ever-increasing demands. Whisper launched its foam sanitary pads in China recently. The product has adopted FlexFoam, a material that can absorb 10 times its weight in liquids and remain contoured to the human body, to eliminate leakage. The pads are currently only manufactured in Canada and Hungary. Tohamy said that for the past few years the Chinese market's needs had advanced quickly and Whisper had not always kept up but was now moving to meet that demand. "There has been a big shift in our commitment to meet but also to drive premium-quality (products) that consumers are looking for," he added. China is the fifth country to sell the new Whisper foam pads after the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Italy. The company also said it plans to increase technological innovation in its product lineup and bring out more high-end products in the future. P&G said earlier it had committed to investing in China to become more high-end in the consumer market, pushed by increased competition from other brands and premium products. The consumer group said competition had been hotting up, ratcheting up the pressure on the major players. In fiscal year 2016, the US-based consumer goods company reported a 5 percent year-on-year decline in organic sales in China, its second-biggest market. It said as a result it was set to enhance its group product portfolio with more product innovations and premium offerings. Neil Wang, president of Greater China of market research agency Frost & Sullivan, said: "With increasing living standards and more and more health consciousness in China, women have higher demands of sanitary pads for their function, comfort, safety and health requirements." The growing demand of consumers was, he said, stimulating a steady increase in the sanitary pads market. Wang added that consumers tended to buy niche brands that complied with their individual wishes and requirements, while most of P&G's products were positioned at basic requirement levels. He said that Whisper could achieve a comprehensive brand upgrade with the launch of the new pads to attract more consumers. Wang added that P&G needed to undertake more detailed analysis targeted at consumers' needs in China, focus on its core business and innovate retail channels to realize the high-end transformation of its product base.

By John Kiesewetter • Nov 1, 2016 TweetShareGoogle+Email Credit Procter & Gamble / Provided Cincinnati's Procter & Gamble might not be the nation's No. 1 advertiser if AT&T merges with cable giant Time Warner. The New York Post reports that "if AT&T survives regulatory scrutiny without having to divest too many assets, the new AT&T will become the nation’s No. 1 advertiser — leaping past Procter & Gamble, the maker of toilet paper, toothpaste and laundry detergent. The mega-merger is expected to take a year to close." P&G spends $4.3 billion in advertising, the paper says. At 2015 spending levels, the new AT&T/Time Warner together would devote $5.6 billion to advertising, when when you combine AT&T's $3.9 billion and Time Warner's $1.7 billion. AT&T also "would become the biggest media owner, leaping over Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, but would sit behind Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook in terms of market capitalization," the paper said. AT&T's new DirecTV Now, an online offering of 100 channels, will be launched Friday, the paper said.

Taylor, diretor-presidente da Procter & Gamble, diz que a empresa precisa ser mais eficiente nas suas atividades fundamentais, como a venda em massa no varejo e o marketing de seus produtos. Photo: Business Wire Por Sharon Terlep, de Cincinnati Sharon Terlep The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiografiaSharon Terlep @sharonterlep Terça-Feira, 1 de Novembro de 2016 00:04 EDT O rápido crescimento da empresa americana Dollar Shave Club, que envia pelo correio aparelhos de barbear e uma variedade de itens de cuidados pessoais diretamente ao consumidor e também oferece outros serviços on-line, surpreendeu alguns executivos da Procter & Gamble Co. e deixou atordoada uma indústria que via o domínio da linha Gilette, da P&G, como inabalável. Mas o diretor-presidente da P&G, David Taylor, continua tranquilo. Há um ano no comando da maior empresa de itens de consumo do mundo, o executivo americano de 58 anos ressalta que a participação da Dollar Shave Club está “estagnando” e que o mercado da “startups” é “muito segmentado”. “Se você tem produtos com desempenho superior e divulga bem isso”, disse ele ao The Wall Street Journal, “você tende a vencer com o passar do tempo”. Num momento em que mudanças nos hábitos de consumo revolucionam o modo como as pessoas fazem compras e muitos dos gigantes corporativos buscam se reinventar, Taylor evita falar de reinvenção. Ele tem como meta manter a P&G na liderança ao reforçar os pontos fortes tradicionais da firma americana. ENLARGE Há 36 anos na P&G, Taylor não demonstrou interesse em adquirir uma startup famosa. Também não lançou novas marcas grandes ou fez planos para uma mudança sísmica na forma de distribuir itens domésticos básicos ao consumidor. Para alguns em Wall Street, a estratégia soa arrogante. A fabricante das fraldas Pampers e do detergente líquido para roupas Ariel vem registrando anos de crescimento anêmico e perda de participação de mercado. “O mundo inteiro ao redor dele está mudando, mas eles querem continuar fazendo” o mesmo de sempre, diz o analista Ali Dibadj, da firma financeira americana Bernstein Research. Segundo Dibadj, vai chegar um ponto em que a empresa terá de enfrentar isso. “Parece que a arrogância da P&G está de volta.” Com fala mansa, Taylor parece o oposto do arrogante. Ex-gerente de fábrica, ele migrou para a área de gestão de marca e escalou a hierarquia da P&G. Em seu escritório na sede da P&G, em Cincinnati, no Estado de Ohio, Taylor disse estar confiante de que as melhores perspectivas da P&G continuam ligadas aos fundamentos da empresa. Isso significa vender para as massas por meio de grandes varejistas com base em pesquisas meticulosas sobre o consumidor, uma operação gigantesca de pesquisa e desenvolvimento e o maior orçamento de publicidade do mundo. A P&G, diz ele, precisa aprender a fazer essas coisas mais rapidamente e de forma mais eficaz. “Nós sempre respeitamos nossos concorrentes e vamos aprender”, disse ele. “Há vezes em que temos de nos concentrar em valor e vezes em que temos de nos concentrar no desempenho.” Questionado sobre a aquisição recente da Dollar Shave Club pela rival europeia Unilever PLC, um negócio de US$ 1 bilhão anunciado pela empresa rival como uma forma de coletar dados do consumidor, Taylor destaca que a P&G já possui um banco valioso de dados e ideias. A participação de mercado da Gillette caiu 10% desde a chegada da Dollar Shave Club, apesar de a marca ainda deter quase 60% do mercado de lâminas masculinas de barbear nos Estados Unidos. Em uma conferência de resultados recente, o diretor financeiro da P&G, Jon Moeller, respondeu a uma pergunta sobre vendas diretas ao consumidor ressaltando que o setor é pequeno. “Quantas pessoas você realmente conhece que querem satisfazer as necessidades de compras da família tendo que ir a 40 sites de varejo para 40 produtos diferentes?” A P&G já teve experiências com venda direta antes, como o serviço por assinatura para o seu produto Tide Pods, mas não investiu em nenhuma iniciativa mais ampla nesse sentido. No seu primeiro ano como diretor-presidente, Taylor duplicou os cortes de custos, anunciando, em fevereiro, um plano para reduzir US$ 10 bilhões adicionais ao longo dos próximos quatro anos. A empresa eliminou mais de 20 mil postos de trabalho desde 2012 e faturou mais de US$ 20 bilhões ao se desfazer de marcas como Duracell e CoverGirl. Muitas das novas economias virão de reestruturações nas cadeias de suprimento na América do Norte e na Europa. A P&G está concentrando forças em seus dois maiores mercados, a China e a América do Norte. Mas ela busca cortar custos e se tornar mais eficiente globalmente. Na América Latina, onde a instabilidade política contribuiu para vários resultados trimestrais fracos, a companhia começou recentemente a reorganizar a fabricação de uma série de produtos na tentativa de ampliar a flexibilidade das operações de manufatura. A P&G tem perdido participação de mercado na China, o que Taylor descreveu como um resultado “inaceitável” da tentativa fracassada da empresa de se manter à frente das marcas locais. Ele admite que a P&G teve seus tropeços. Ela continuou se expandindo durante a recessão e se tornou muito dispersa, diz ele. Depois, cortou investimentos em pesquisa e desenvolvimento e na construção de marca e tentou reverter o crescimento lento aumentando os preços, mas perdeu mercado. “Nós perdemos o equilíbrio e estamos tentando retomá-lo”, diz ele. Um ponto-chave para voltar aos trilhos, segundo ele, é eliminar níveis de burocracia que tornam mais lento o processo de criação de novos produtos. Os executivos dizem que estão vendo resultados. Um exemplo é o sabão para lavar roupas Tide Purclean, não prejudicial ao meio ambiente. Ele foi concebido e chegou ao mercado em nove meses. Um novo produto costumava levar entre dois e três anos para ser desenvolvido na P&G. Fundamental para acelerar o processo foi um novo método em que líderes de diferentes áreas trabalharam simultaneamente. Então, em vez de concluir o desenvolvimento químico do produto e depois deixar o trabalho com a equipe que desenvolve a embalagem, essas etapas foram desenvolvidas conjuntamente. Lori Hudson, gestora de portfólio da consultoria americana de investimentos Bahl & Gaynor, que já teve ações da P&G, gosta do fato de Taylor ter reconhecido os equívocos na China, já que a P&G “nunca pareceu ser o tipo de empresa que admite erros”. Mas Taylor “é uma pessoa que passou a vida na P&G e isso pode ser bom ou ruim, porque as coisas mudaram muito em termos do que o consumidor quer”, diz Hudson. “Ele é um visionário? Não sei.” Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Tamanho da fonte Regular Médio Grande Google+ Imprimir Wall Street Journal Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ YouTube Podcasts GooglePlay AppStore Assinar /Acessar Voltar ao alto« Subscribe Why Subscribe?

LEAD 6 Unforgettable Lessons That Have Guided My Business Career Follow these, go forth, and succeed. By Steve Cody I'm a climber, comedian, and dog lover. But not necessarily in that order. I also happen to be co-founder and CEO of Peppercomm, a strategic communications firm headquartered in NYC, with offices in San Francisco and London. I publish RepMan, a daily blog, and have had the opportunity to appear on CNBC, MSNBC, NPR, and a host of other top-tier media over the years. scody@peppercomm.com @RepManCody Co-founder, Peppercomm@RepManCody WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Having achieved a modicum of success since beginning my career shortly after Einstein invented electricity, I've learned, or experienced, lessons that I believe will make you a better businessperson. See what you think: 1.) Patience is a virtue. Every organization has underachievers who, nonetheless, strike you as diamonds in the rough. Be patient with them. Once upon a time, I submitted a clearly inferior piece of copy but, instead of berating me, my boss took a full hour to explain where I'd missed the mark. I asked him why. He sat back and said, "Because one day you'll be in my position and spot someone who possesses the skills, but needs expert guidance. I'll expect you to treat her in exactly the same way." Great advice. 2.) Loose lips sink ships. I was the junior member of a global agency pitch team that had just won a sizable piece of P&G. As we partied on the flight home, some of us poked fun at the client decision-makers. Big mistake. Sitting directly behind us was a P&G employee. He promptly debriefed our new client who, within hours, became our erstwhile client. 3.) Lose the attitude. I'd been scoring success after success at a particular firm, and felt I was long overdue for a raise. So, I casually strolled into my CEO's office and told him so. I was lucky to escape with my life, much less my job. He gave me 24-hours to convince him why I deserved to continue drawing a paycheck. I was crestfallen. Luckily, though, I was also blessed with a superb mentor who talked me off the ledge, and helped me create a 90-day plan that highlighted past successes while outlining how I'd raise the bar in the next three months. I slinked back into the CEO's cavernous office. He reviewed my one-pager, inhaled deeply on his cigar and said, "OK, kid. You have 90 days." Once the CEO was convinced I'd lost my sense of entitlement (Note to Millennials: You did not invent entitlement), he promoted me AND gave me a raise! 4.) Don't underestimate looks. This may be politically incorrect, but sometimes first looks do make a lasting impression. Once upon a time, we were desperately trying to staff a rapidly growing account. We interviewed a guy who possessed all of the right credentials, but whose physical appearance made Nick Nolte look well-coiffed. Desperate as we were, we hired the guy and sent him to client meetings where he promptly fell asleep! Turned out his disheveled appearance resulted from his working two jobs and getting little, if any, sleep. Rather than risk the badly understaffed account, we sent Pigpen packing. 5.) Weed out the grapevine. Rumors can kill the most successful business. Once, during a Verizon power outage, we lost all phone and e-mail service for 48 hours. This wouldn't have been such a big deal if the outage hadn't occurred in April of 2000 when 35 percent of our dotcom clients were walking out the door at breakneck speed. Since the trade media couldn't reach us, rumors began flying that we'd gone out of business. Our management team jumped on cell phones to reassure all of our constituent audiences that the exact opposite was the case, but the damage had been done (at least temporarily). I'd guess it took us a good six months to regain trust with employees, clients, prospects and the trade alike. Prepare for the unexpected and nip the grapevine in the bud. 6.) I have met the enemy and he is me. Marissa Mayer won't do it. John Stumpf wouldn't do it. And, lord knows Jeff Skilling refused to do it. "It" is admitting fault for grievous mistakes and pledging to make immediate corrections. The buck stops with you. The very best leaders assume responsibility when the sh*t hits the fan. I've accepted full responsibility for my own mistakes at least three or four times over the past two decades. These have included inadvertently naming our firm Peppercom (and attracting every dotcom under the sun). It was a beautiful thing until the tech bubble burst, so I added an "M" to our surname. I also hired 10 new staffers based upon oral promises from two clients who said they'd double their billings (neither did and we were forced to downsize). And, I've admitted countless times that my  blogs have gotten us into trouble with prospects and clients alike and, indeed, even cost us a client.     The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.

World Trademark Review Login Reset password Toggle navigation Home Home Magazine Blog Market intelligence Top TM professionals Research Legal updates Events International directory Media P&G targets lookalikes in its latest push to enforce Head & Shoulders brand rights 02 Nov 16 < Back to Blogs Jack Ellis Procter & Gamble (P&G) appears to be intensifying its enforcement efforts in relation to its key product brands, as it tackles another alleged violation of IP rights covering its Head & Shoulders haircare line. On Monday this week, P&G filed a lawsuit in the US Middle District of Tennessee against Vi-Jon, a manufacturer of personal care products that describes itself as “a proven leader in private brand solutions”. In the filing, P&G alleges that the packaging of some of Vi-Jon’s shampoo products – which are sold to retail chains to be marketed as private-label or ‘own-brand’ items – infringe on the trademarks and trade dress of its Head & Shoulders line of anti-dandruff shampoos and conditioners. In particular, P&G claims that Vi-Jon shampoo bottles sold in US retail chains CVS, Dollar General and Kroger “mimic the shape, colors and label of Head & Shoulders… in a way that infringes its trade dress”. Quoted in a press release, P&G’s chief legal officer Deborah Majoras said: “We invest heavily in all aspects of our product, and its appearance has become inextricably linked with what we stand for to our consumers… When a competitor makes products that come too close to our legally protected trademarks and trade dress, it’s unfair to consumers, and to our employees and shareholders, and we will challenge those violations.” This is not the first time that Vi-Jon has been accused of infringement by P&G. Back in February 2006, P&G sued the private-label manufacturer for alleged trade dress infringement, dilution and false advertising relating to its Crest Pro-Health mouthwash products. In May 2011, P&G filed trademark and patent infringement suits against Vi-Jon in the Southern District of Ohio, this time regarding packaging of a mouthwash product retailed by Target that allegedly copied its Scope Outlast branding. According to 2013 research commissioned by the UK IP Office, ‘lookalike’ private-label products account for 23% share of the groceries market across the European Union. On average, such items are 31% cheaper than ‘name-brand’ products. The research also found a “small, but statistically significant” ‘lookalike effect’ leading consumers to believe that similar-looking products share similar characteristics and origins, indicating the scale of the problem that faces brand owners. P&G’s running battle with Vi-Jon over the years demonstrates how seriously it believes private-label lookalikes impact on its business and its consumers – and it is a battle that it has waged on a global scale. Earlier this year the company took high-profile action to protect its Head & Shoulders brand from counterfeits, filing UK trademark lawsuits against discount retailer Poundstretcher and its suppliers for selling fake versions of the shampoo. It is a battle that will likely continue in today’s competitive marketplace.  Channels Brand strategy Trade dress Infringement Passing off Brand In-house issues Comments Please log in or register to leave a comment.

About the performance of Amul, although the company has revenue $743.69 Million, which is slight more than Godrej Consumer Products but the PAT margin is least amongst others having just 0.32%. In case of Amul, the reason can be the fact of controlled prices and nature of milk and milk made products.

Even when great ideas come up from the lowest of the hierarchical ladder, it is rarely delivered to the very top. The leadership shouts for innovation, but it often does not realize that innovation is within arm's reach. Letting ideas flow freely within an organization ― the open innovation platform ― is a critical factor in driving creative success for a company. "It's not okay from the CEO's perspective to say to that bright young person you just hired, 'if you have an idea, you have to sell the idea to your boss, your boss' boss and your boss' boss' boss before it has a chance of being implemented,'" said Tom Kelley, partner at IDEO, the world's first and largest design thinking consultancy which started off in Palo Alto, California. "Some people you hire for their deep technical excellence, but they don't always have the communication skills to sell the idea to the hierarchy. As an outsider, I don't want to shake up the hierarchy, I want to go to the CEO and say 'Look, you've earned the right to be the boss, to make the hiring decisions, but don't let the hierarchy get in the way of the free flow of ideas,'" he said during an interview with The Korea Times. Kelley was in Seoul to give a speech at Startup:CON (Oct. 11-12), a conference for startups and innovators, organized by the Korea Creative Content Agency (KOCCA). "In all such cultures, you've got to find a way to have that idea float, go up and down the hierarchy, through an open innovation platform inside the company -- whether it be poster-days or internal trade fairs ― or some way that systematically floats ideas up and down. You have to have a way," he said. Tom Kelley speaks during an interview with The Korea Times. / Courtesy of Startup:CON Barriers to innovation The hierarchical structure isn't just confined to Asia. The problem is not much different in the United States, he said. There are always barriers within any organization in the world and so there's a need to get through it, Kelley added. "Especially in hierarchical cultures you need to find some way to cut through the hierarchy with respect to ideas. My experience is, you have the support at the very top. I've never met a CEO who is not pro-innovation. So the support is there. It's just in some organizations, there's the energy at the top among visionaries and there's the energy among young new members of the team who want to change the world ― it only gets stuck in the middle." Cultural barriers to innovation are also not confined to a hierarchical system. In large established companies, there's "always the need to get today's work out perfectly," says Kelley. "Sometimes they don't have the time or attention to think of tomorrow. If you're too focused on getting today's work done ― the only job in front of you ― that's a barrier." Design thinking This is where design thinking comes in. Design thinking is a cognitive methodology and activity that helps people to develop creative ways to solve issues. Kelley puts it as "using the tool set or mindset of a designer ― such as designing objects or architecture ― and taking that same process and applying it to bigger issues such as designing a school system, designing new ways to interact with health services or rural villages to get better access to clean water." Simply put, it is "using the tool set or mindset of a designer for broader topics." Kelly says the three key tools for design thinking are empathy, experimentation and storytelling. "If you're a tech company, you need to blend technology with humanity. You need to bring your strengths to the table. Then the heart of the experiment must be that we're the kind of team that tries stuff. We will fail but we will still try stuff. You need to prototype. Finally, even with the best idea in the world, if you can't get other people to adopt it, it's not going to change anything. You need to take that concept and wrap it in a good story." IDEO, which his brother David Kelley founded and Tom Kelley is a partner at, is a company that has pioneered in design thinking for the past 30 years, creating human-centered products, services and spaces, and helping organizations innovate by empowering the people who drive them. Changing the culture What they have seen from the example of P&G, their most memorable client which saw success from applying design thinking to their company, was that the role of a middle manager or those with significant authority who were able to "pick up the ball" was crucial in initiating creative projects. "We collectively changed the culture of P&G during that era. It included support from the top, but that's not enough. Claudia (Kotchka), a leader with a big personality, a lot of stamina, and with permission from the CEO, systematically drove design thinking within P&G. She was vice president for design innovation and strategy and had the respect which went with her high position but she didn't have direct authority with anyone she worked with. She had to convince them using the power of her arguments over the power of authority," Kelley said. "The same thing happened with Kaaren (Hanson), vice president of design innovation at Intuit. Top support was not enough. The executives said they'll do it but didn't come back and went on with their daily jobs. Nothing happened. So she picked up the ball. She created a program called Catalyst with nine people. They needed a series of successes. You need to point to a success or two for the skeptics. If you get to the successes, then you have entry proof to say 'Here's a situation where design thinking won the day,' as soon as people see that, they'll say 'yes I want some.'" Kelley says the P&G model is replicable. "Anybody with the right support and right energy can do that," he said. "It really changed P&G ― we saw it in their stock price, product introduction, and passion of individuals. They designed hands on experiences with design thinking, and realized this stuff actually worked. It wasn't persuading them but demonstrating for them. It was a different lens to look at their business. Even among the skeptics, when the early successes come out, they'd say, 'I want some of that. Get that for my division.'" However, success is not always measured as a number, he says. "A clear understanding of what success looks or feels like can be useful. There's not an obvious metric." Creative confidence Kelley, author of "Creative Confidence" and "The Art of Innovation," was nowhere near the artistic world. He was working in the finance, IT and consulting fields, before joining IDEO to work with his brother. He says working with creative people has transformed him. "You have to be vulnerable enough to be willing to try something you won't necessarily be good at right away and then you've got to be humble to realize how much you can learn," said Kelley. "To be honest, at some point in the early history of IDEO, we had some (employees with) MBAs from very prestigious schools who came in and thought they already knew what they needed to know and had trouble being team players with designers, engineers and anthropologists. We need to take the opposite approach. If you want to achieve creative confidence, you have to first acknowledge that you have something to learn." Being open to possibilities is the step to gaining creative confidence, he said. Newspaper innovation How can design thinking be applied to newspapers? "It's quite a challenge. It's an extremely challenging environment. It's not that a worthy competitor has stolen a bit of market share from us that we could steal back. It's not one core aspect of our business that is demonetized. It's hard to compete against free," he said. "I want to pay for news because I want journalism. Not somebody's opinion. I want somebody who's verified their facts. That is not free and somebody has to pay for it. I'm willing to pay my fair share of that." The newspaper industry has to figure out a way to innovate itself, said Kelley. "How might we sustain really good journalism through the next few decades? Very possibly the answer is not in print form." To view the video clip of the interview, click on the link below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERPDWkuabzM&t=18s ysy@ktimes.com 1.

New, 2 comments Is this a questionable partnership? by simeonmoses Oct 31, 2016, 5:00pm PDT tweet share pin Rec Amway is getting involved in NCAA sports Justin Ford-USA TODAY Sports The former USA Today Coaches poll is now being referred to as the “Amway Coaches Poll.” An undisclosed sum was paid for the naming rights in conjunction with the American Football Coaches Association and USA Today Sports Media group. Amway will also have naming rights to a new fan based poll and “The Symbol of Supremacy in College Football™, the AFCA Coaches’ Trophy.” So what's the big deal you ask? Lots of companies are involved in the naming rights of sports organizations so why is Amway's entrance into the college football world any different? Let's dive in to what Amway is, their history and why the naming rights to the Coaches Poll could be of some concern. Amway is what is referred as a Multi-Level Marketing firm. The FTC sued Amway back in 1979 alleging it was a pyramid scheme but Amway settled for a fine when a judged ruled they were not an illegal pyramid scheme but did engage in price fixing and illegal marketing practices by inflating the average distributor profits reported. In 1986 they were fined again for illegal marketing practices. Most recently Amway settled a lawsuit alleging illegal business practices for $56 million dollars in which the plaintiffs accused Amway of running an illegal pyramid scheme. They have also been sued by the RIAA for $9 million for illegal use of music and in a stranger lawsuit, Procter and Gamble won a $19.25 million lawsuit against Amway when some affiliated “IBOs” accused P&G CEO of being a satanist and using a satanic trademark. Regardless of one's views on multi-level marketing it is apparent that Amway has run into consistent legal issues due to their business practices. According to Amway's own brochure (2012) fine print only .32% of their IBO participants achieved a median income of $55,042 to achieve their elite Q12 status. That means over 99% of participants were making less than the U.S. median wage. Such a low success rate they legally were obligated to disclose is not a business opportunity that is appropriate for most individuals, in particular low-income college students who can not reasonably afford the investment risk to get started. Back in 2004 when Amway was doing business as Quixtar, Chris Hansen with Dateline NBC did a hidden camera expose of the tactics used to lure in new participants. The shady tactics used by Quixtar are the same tactics that Amway uses today (Quixtar brand was “retired” in 2008). Amway is also a major contributor to political campaigns. According to opensecrets.org Amway ranked 54th (as of this writing) of over 17,000 companies who have donated to candidates and PACs with over 4.3 million dollars donated this election cycle. This is part of their overall strategy to keep their version of multi-level marketing legal. This has become a more pressing issue for Amway as a similar company, Herbalife, continues to face scrutiny from the FTC that Herbalife is operating as a pyramid scheme. This was recently highlighted in a Slate article how the Direct Selling Association, of which Amway is a major part of, is using political muscle to influence legislation in their favor to continue business practices many still find questionable. So what does all this have to do with the Amway Coaches Poll? Speaking with expert, Robert Fitzpatrick, who has been an expert witness in legal cases against MLM companies, Amway may be looking to gain more influence over potential targeted demographics of the company. Buying the naming rights to the Coaches poll gets the brand Amway more publicly known and helps legitimize their business in the public's eyes through their association of the trusted American Football Coaches Association. Amway may potentially be targeting college students in their naming rights effort. According to Fitzpatrick, this would make a lot of sense for Amway to target a college-aged population. As younger generations are less aware of the Amway's legal troubles, they may look more favorably upon becoming one of Amway's “IBOs” or Independent Business Operators not having known others who have already lost money in this MLM enterprise. Amway's business model relies on the constant absorption of fresh recruits into their fold. College students deep in debt and looking for extra money may be attracted to what is pitched as a lucrative business opportunity. Unfortunately, the statistics for success for Amway distributors is extremely low. The average distributor lost $1,176 in 2010. That may not seem like a lot of money to some individuals but that is a steep sum to a college student who generally has very little incoming cash flow. Thus, vulnerable college students may find themselves deeper in debt pursuing an opportunity that is pushed on them using high pressure tactics that are well documented among past participants. If you google an impartial term like “Amway reviews” countless blogs and stories document the people feeling scammed in the wake of becoming an Amway distributor. Those associated with college athletics should take a deep look into who they are partnering with and ask some tough questions. Is Amway the kind of company the NCAA and college athletics should be associating with? Those of us on the outside looking in should also take part in this discussion. Whether a journalist, athlete or fan we all have a big stake in making sure students and athletes are not being targeted when they are most economically vulnerable by brands looking to take advantage of those vulnerabilities.

The ad entitled “Ladies Room” depicts Dana, a transgender woman, steeling herself to leave the anonymity of the bathroom stall and join the other women in at the sinks and mirrors of a public restroom. In the ad, Karis Wilde plays Dana and though she says nothing, it is apparent what’s going through her head – anxiety, some fear, perhaps shame. Finally she emerges from the stall as the following caption appears on the screen: “Stress test #8260 — Dana finds the courage to show there’s no wrong way to be a woman.” “I always have moments of insecurity but I have conditioned myself to act unbothered,” Karis told Queerty when asked if the scene bears any resemblance to her daily life. “While shooting, I allowed myself to feel vulnerable. It terrified me how much I’ve stored all those emotions; I almost cried in the middle of taping.” Watch the ad above. Procter & Gamble has a score of 100 on HRC’s Corporate Equality Index, an annual survey and report that benchmarks the LGBTQ inclusive policies, practices and benefits of America’s largest companies.

Chief Executive Bob Iger's scheduled retirement date looms closer, the entertainment giant's search for his replacement remains low-profile, a departure from the open process it previously employed. It's been seven months since heir apparent Tom Staggs' abrupt departure left Iger without a clear-cut successor. The top executive recruiting firms say they haven't been hired by Disney, and Iger hasn't moved members of his executive team into newer or more prominent roles to audition them for the top spot. The company has said only that there is a process in place that the board is following which will include evaluating internal and external candidates. VIDEOS TOP JOBS While there's still time to conduct a search before Iger's contract ends in June 2018, the quiet nature of the current succession planning stands in sharp contrast to the widely watched, five-year bake-off from which Staggs emerged as the leading contender for the job. That's fueling speculation that the board could request that Iger, 65, stay on longer than his scheduled retirement date, something it has already asked of him twice before. "I don't think anyone -- employee, investor or director -- would be hesitant in granting him a new contract," said Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Nomura Securities in New York. "That could happen quickly and easily. Why hasn't it happened already? That's a fair question." Iger said on a May conference call with investors that he didn't have any plans to stick around past the current date. "The board is very actively engaged in a succession process, as it has been actually for some time," he said. "It believes that it has ample time to identify a successor under timing circumstances that will be just fine for the company." A spokeswoman for Disney declined to comment further. Disney board members on the governance and nominating committee, including former Starbucks Corp. CEO Orin Smith, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and former Clorox Chairman Robert Matschullat, didn't respond or declined to comment. Typically it takes a big public company six to seven months to complete a search once the board begins to contact and interview prospective candidates, though additional time is required before that, said Peter Crist, chairman of Crist Kolder Associates, a boutique search firm outside Chicago. "We do lots of mapping projects with the company that take months" about the qualities it wants and needs in a new CEO, Crist said. At Wal-Mart Stores, executive recruiter Spencer Stuart began consulting with directors about what the company needed in a new leader and who they should consider about a year before Doug McMillon was named the retailer's CEO in November 2013, according to people familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified because they aren't authorized to talk publicly. The board narrowed its search to two internal candidates, McMillon and former head of U.S. operations Bill Simon, about six months before making its final decision. At Procter & Gamble, directors first started talking about replacing then-CEO Bob MacDonald in July 2012 and then asked A.G. Lafley to return as CEO and chairman in May 2013. Lafley, who'd already served as CEO at P&G from 2000 until 2009, immediately reorganized the company into four businesses, each headed by a president who was considered a contender for the CEO post. One of the four, David Taylor, was named global president of home care and subsequently also took charge of P&G's beauty business. In July 2015, Lafley and P&G's other directors named Taylor the consumer giant's new CEO, concluding the two-year process. Iger himself was promoted in 2005 after a six-month search by the board. The executive, who had led Disney's TV operations and international business and had served as president for five years, was evaluated against external candidates with help from Heidrick & Struggles, directors said at the time. He got the top job only after a high-profile campaign by some shareholders to oust then-CEO Michael Eisner. Former directors in a long-running feud with the company still criticized Iger's selection as hasty, but the board said it had been thorough and careful. Until this year, it looked as if Disney's choice for Iger's successor would be more orderly, with a seasoned executive waiting in the wings in the COO position. Staggs had risen to the No. 2 spot at the company after a five-year period in which he and another senior manager, Jay Rasulo, competed with each other to become Iger's successor, even switching jobs to give Staggs more experience operating a business and Rasulo exposure to the executive suite. Rasulo, then serving as chief financial officer, left the company last year after Staggs's promotion to COO. Staggs's exit, after failing to gain the full backing of Iger and the board, left no other internal candidate with both operational experience and a corporate role. Of the six CEOs since Disney's founding in 1923, only Eisner came from the outside. Eisner, who served from 1984 to 2005, joined the company from Paramount Pictures, where he was president. » Next page...

Tech firms are the best place to look. brionv via Flickr By James K. Glassman, Contributing Columnist From Kiplinger's Personal Finance, December 2016 Rapidly rising revenues are my favorite indicator of a great company. Economists say that a stock’s value ultimately reflects the profits—not the revenues, or sales—that a firm is expected to reap in the future. But it’s easier for a company to manipulate reported earnings than revenues. Moreover, although a firm can cut costs to boost profits over the short term, even if sales are stagnant, cost-cutting isn’t a productive long-term strategy. See Also: 10 Worst Stocks of the Bull Market To get higher profits over the long haul, you need higher sales. And to get higher sales, you need products and services that keep improving. Where is that improvement most dramatic? In technology firms. Alphabet (symbol GOOGL, $804), the former Google, is now raking in ad sales at a rate of more than $6 billion a month, or roughly the same as all the television networks combined. But Alphabet has other ventures, including apps, maps, self-driving cars, broadband and health care, and it has made investments in more than 300 businesses, including Uber and Nest (see A Smarter Way to Heat and Cool Your Home). Stocks in boldface are those I recommend; prices are as of September 30. Amazon.com (AMZN, $837) is not just the world’s largest online retailer; it also runs a $10-billion-a-year cloud-computing business, makes the world’s number-one streaming media player (Fire TV), and produces original TV series that this year received five Emmy awards. Amazon’s price-earnings ratio is a sky-high 95, based on projected earnings for the year ahead, but I don’t care. Big profits will come later. Advertisement In the second quarter of 2016, total revenues for the companies that make up Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 1.2% compared with the same period a year earlier. But revenues at Facebook (FB, $128) in the same quarter soared 59%. Sales at Netflix (NFLX) have increased by an average annual rate of 26% over the past five years; Amazon and Alphabet, by 26% and 21%, respectively. Comparing Value Line’s estimates of revenues for 2016 with actual results in 2010, I found that Facebook’s revenues have risen by a factor of 13, and those of Amazon, Net­flix and Alphabet have each more than tripled. (Facebook did not go public until 2012, but the company reported its audited financial results for previous years.) By contrast, revenues for Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) rose a total of just 14%, and sales for Procter & Gamble (PG) have actually fallen. Of course, it’s the future, not the past, that counts for shareholders. Analysts believe these four companies—collectively known as the FANGs (the last letter coming from Alphabet’s former name)—will keep growing at a remarkable pace. Value Line projects that over the next five years, the rate of growth of revenues for Facebook will be 31%; Amazon and Netflix, 20%; Alphabet, 13%. In a U.S. economy that is growing by only about 3% annually, including inflation, these figures are mind-boggling. (For another take on the FANGs, see Practical Investing.) Before you rush out to buy the FANG stocks, consider an intriguing alternative. Nearly 20 years ago, I introduced readers to a portfolio devised by Leslie Douglas, of Folger Nolan Fleming Douglas, a venerable Washington, D.C., investment firm that was founded in 1889. Les Douglas, who died at age 96 in 2010, had an elegant idea for his clients: Buy equal dollar amounts of the five largest stocks on the Nasdaq exchange at the start of each year, then repeat annually. The brilliance of the Douglas Theory is that, first, you own big tech companies, which tend to be more stable than smaller ones; second, by reallocating each year, you shift your money away from stocks that have soared recently and toward those that may be better values; and, finally, your portfolio gradually changes with the times. Advertisement For example, in 1997, when I first wrote about the Douglas Theory, the five largest Nasdaq stocks were Cisco Systems (CSCO), Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT, $58), Oracle (ORCL) and MCI (which later merged into WorldCom, which filed for bankruptcy in 2002). Four of the five are no longer on the Douglas Theory list. Compared with the FANGs, Douglas drops Netflix and adds Apple (AAPL), which has the largest market cap of any U.S. company, and Microsoft, which ranks third, after Alphabet. Apple is no slouch when it comes to revenue growth—up an average of 37% annually for the past five years. Microsoft is the outlier, with just 9% annualized growth. Since 1991, Douglas Theory stocks have gained an average of 24% a year, or about twice the return of the S&P 500. Last year, the portfolio returned 42%, compared with 1.4% for the S&P, and in the first nine months of 2016, Douglas earned 12.9%, compared with 7.8% for the S&P. Another way to buy fast-growing tech stocks is through PowerShares QQQ (QQQ, $119), an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq 100 index. Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon account for 40% of the fund’s assets. Over the past 10 years, QQQ returned 12.3% annualized, an average of 5.0 percentage points per year more than the S&P 500. With the high returns of fast growers, however, comes high short-term risk. Over the past three years, QQQ has been 29% more volatile than the S&P 500. That said, the balance sheets of the fast growers are rock-solid. Value Line gives its highest rating for “financial strength,” A++, to Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft; Amazon and Facebook each get an impressive A+. Alphabet has $78 billion in cash and short-term investments and just $4 billion in debt; Facebook has $23 billion in cash and short-term investments and no debt. Advertisement I noted earlier that Amazon’s P/E is in the stratosphere, but I don’t think that all of the FANG and Douglas stocks are overpriced. Facebook’s P/E is 27, based on projected profits. That’s not too pricey for a company whose sales are growing so rapidly. Alphabet’s P/E is 21; Microsoft’s is 19; Apple’s, 13. Netflix, which has eked out only small profits, has a P/E of 154. In fact, I have some worries about Netflix—as much as I love its service. Unlike the other five companies, it has only a single business line, and it has attracted some rough competition. Also, it is much smaller than the others. There’s a case for eliminating Microsoft as well because its growth rate is so much lower (Value Line projects just 7% annual profit growth for the next five years). But Microsoft has clearly gotten a second wind, and I would leave it in a collection of fast growers with Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon. Call them the Four Revenue Risers for the Millennium, or an FRRM portfolio of FAAM stocks. No guarantees, of course, but you should get a profitable ride over the long haul.

Munger faces Democrat Susana Mendoza, Libertarian Claire Ball, and the Green Party's Tim Curtin in the general election. Associated Press   By SOPHIA TAREEN     CHICAGO -- Four candidates are running for Illinois comptroller, the person who controls the state's checkbook. Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner appointed business executive Leslie Munger to the post last year after the death of Judy Baar Topinka, who died shortly after winning re-election in 2014. The winner of next Tuesday's special election, coinciding with the presidential contest, will fill the remainder of the term expiring in 2019. Munger is running, along with Democrat Susana Mendoza, Libertarian Claire Ball and Green Party candidate Tim Curtin. Here's a closer look at the candidates: REPUBLICAN: Leslie Geissler Munger, 60, Lincolnshire Family: Married, two sons Education: University of Illinois, B.A.; Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, M.B.A. Occupation and experience: After making an unsuccessful bid for the Illinois House in 2014, she was appointed Illinois comptroller, her first public office. Worked as a brand management executive with Unilever Helene Curtis, for Procter and Gamble and McKinsey and Company Inc. Illinois' top issues: Debt, growing pension and Medicaid costs, and outdated technology. On prioritizing bills: "As a rule of thumb: Those suffering the greatest hardship, and our most vulnerable, should always take precedence." On term limits: "Term limits and redistricting reform are essential for ensuring more accountable government in Springfield." On the budget gridlock: "We can't just cut our way to a balanced budget - we also need new revenue. I believe that can best be achieved through expanding our tax base by making Illinois a place where employers want to locate, expand and create new jobs." DEMOCRAT: Susana Mendoza, 44, Chicago Family: Married, one son Education: Truman State University, B.A. Occupation and experience: Elected Chicago's city clerk in 2011. Served as Illinois state representative from 2001 to 2011. Worked as an advertising account executive and in Chicago's planning department. Illinois' top issues: Lack of a budget, erosion of middle class and increased poverty, and gun violence. On prioritizing bills: "I will continually serve and protect the most vulnerable populations of this state and not allow myself to be party to a political agenda that, for all intent and purposes, holds payments to the most vulnerable in our state hostage." On term limits: "Term limits already exist in the form of elections where voters get to choose who they want to represent them." On the budget gridlock: "It is imperative that all legislative and statewide leadership put partisan politics aside to examine the most comprehensive and effective fiscal strategies to bring about a financial recovery across the state." LIBERTARIAN Claire Ball, 34, Addison Family: Married Education: DeVry University B.A.; Keller Graduate School of Management, M.A. Occupation and experience: Works as an accountant at U.S. Cellular. First time seeking public office. Illinois' top issues: Partisan politics, unfunded pension liabilities and transparency. On prioritizing bills: "I will publish a table of categories that details the payment priority order. The top of that list will be mandatory and court-ordered payments followed by service providers, such as mental health facilities, veteran services and elderly care." On term limits: "Term limits are necessary and I support them and would commit to a term limit." On the budget gridlock: "The politics being played on both sides has caused severe damage to Illinois, and further stop gap budgets will only prolong it." GREEN PARTY Tim Curtin, 67, Hillside Family: Married, two children Education: Attended University of Wisconsin-Madison and Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis Occupation and experience: Union organizer with United Electrical Workers. Served as a union trustee, Oak Park committeeman and chairman of a Green Party committee. Illinois' top issues: A balanced budget, restoring social service funding and raising revenue, like taxing financial transactions at exchanges and boards of trade. On prioritizing bills: "I would pay for education and social services first, since they are a necessity for the well-being of the people of Illinois." On term limits: "We do not need term limits. What is needed is an informed public. If the public understood the positions that these elected officials are taking, maybe they would settle and get something accomplished." On the budget gridlock: "We need a balanced budget so we can stop borrowing heavily as a state." ___ Follow Sophia Tareen at http://twitter.com/sophiatareen.

Share Tweet Aa The crowd’s antics of this week’s Melbourne Cup reminded me that we love to stand out from the crowd, be it through fashion, state of sobriety or ability to choose the winning steed. Share Tweet Aa The crowd’s antics of this week’s Melbourne Cup reminded me that we love to stand out from the crowd, be it through fashion, state of sobriety or ability to choose the winning steed. It is a core of human nature and possibly on a race day a relic of mating prowess, the desire to show my choice is correct and superior to those around me. This function of humanity is a modern marketer’s dream. Advanced product differentiation allows brand strategist to separate their product from the crowd and subvert their competition. Let us take water for a basic example, be it still, sparkling, imported, sourced from an ancient frozen glacier or enhanced with vital vitamins you didn’t previously know existed. It is all the same as the product that pours from your tap - with or without fluoride – good old H2O Traditionally, product differentiation has been perfected by the big corporate end of town where a few companies control a category through a multi-brand strategy in a bid to compete. Few people realise that consumer goods behemoth Proctor & Gamble controls 16 individual brands in the laundry detergent isle. Or that drinks manufacturer Coca Cola possesses 26 individual brands and that’s before you split on sub-brands such as diet, sugar-free, taste-free or can, plastic, bottle. In anyone’s language that’s a lot of foam and fizz. The free market economy has meant that even basic needs of survival are being differentiated and marketed to our desires. The deregulation of industry delivers traditional commodity products in a whole new light. Take electricity – now one not only has to choose between dirty coal, renewables or home generation but also billing format, carbon offset programs and the community engagement of their service provider. Looking to food branding, the trend is advancing rapidly in the age of the modern, educated, selfie conscious consumer. Walking down the supermarket isle delivers a plethora of never ever, free from, sustainably locally sourced, hogwash. The free marketer within me screams “what’s the problem you dirty socialist?!” My problem is that certain parts of the food chain are differentiating product through short-term, focused, negative competition. These ill-thought-out strategies are delivering short-term market advantage through targeting the low hanging fruit of certain production techniques. Further sophistication of brand strategy is required and a macro view towards the triple bottom line needs to be taken before the next marketing campaign is simply rolled out. Agricultural operators too often attack their fellow producers in a bid to differentiate, a strategy fraught with danger as highlighted by Four Corners this week in a spectacular fail for the Tasmanian salmon industry.  Looking at an example close to home, simplistically the beef market today tells us to produce black, grass fed, high marbling, HGP free, welfare accredited, walking rib fillets. That’s a cute paradigm if Australia’s rangelands were actually a giant version of King Island but the reality is that they are not.  In comparison, participants in the wine industry have perfected a sophisticated brand strategy particularly well for the betterment and growth of the sector. Difference of product is celebrated and enjoyed, industry arguments of oak versus double oak or cork verse screw cap are not debated in full visual of the consuming public. Further, while organic or sustainable labels exist, they do not market themselves to the detriment of others. It would be a peculiar dinner party for a debate to ensue about the food miles on the bottle of French fizz and while I might look down upon moscato drinkers, diversity of personal choice is revered. Australian agriculture offers a wide wealth of diversity ripe for the picking for sector enhancing product differentiation. I encourage our marketers to look past the simplistic negative comparison of apple vs orange and commence celebrating the full gamut of the fruit bowl.

Florida Travel Orlando Attractions The Daily Disney As Iger's exit nears, Disney takes quiet approach to succession Iger: How Disney Stays on Top Aug. 5 (Bloomberg)- - Bob Iger, chairman and CEO of Walt Disney Co., comments on the company's earnings and the success of Marvel's "Guardians of the Galaxy." He speaks with Jon Erlichman on "Street Smart." (Source: Bloomberg) Aug. 5 (Bloomberg)- - Bob Iger, chairman and CEO of Walt Disney Co., comments on the company's earnings and the success of Marvel's "Guardians of the Galaxy." He speaks with Jon Erlichman on "Street Smart." (Source: Bloomberg) Christopher Palmeri and Carol Hymowitz(c) 2016, Bloomberg Privacy Policy As Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger's scheduled retirement date looms closer, the entertainment giant's search for his replacement remains low-profile, a departure from the open process it previously employed. It's been seven months since heir apparent Tom Staggs' abrupt departure left Iger without a clear-cut successor. The top executive recruiting firms say they haven't been hired by Disney, and Iger hasn't moved members of his executive team into newer or more prominent roles to audition them for the top spot. The company has said only that there is a process in place that the board is following which will include evaluating internal and external candidates. Disney may try to get even bigger to compete with merged AT&T-Time Warner Daniel Miller With a market capitalization of $150 billion, the Walt Disney Co. is an entertainment behemoth. But the Burbank-based company could soon find itself in an unfamiliar position: dwarfed. If regulators approve AT&T’s  $85.4-billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc., the combined company would be far... With a market capitalization of $150 billion, the Walt Disney Co. is an entertainment behemoth. But the Burbank-based company could soon find itself in an unfamiliar position: dwarfed. If regulators approve AT&T’s  $85.4-billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc., the combined company would be far... (Daniel Miller) While there's still time to conduct a search before Iger's contract ends in June 2018, the quiet nature of the current succession planning stands in sharp contrast to the widely watched, five-year bake-off from which Staggs emerged as the leading contender for the job. That's fueling speculation that the board could request that Iger, 65, stay on longer than his scheduled retirement date, something it has already asked of him twice before. "I don't think anyone -- employee, investor or director -- would be hesitant in granting him a new contract," said Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Nomura Securities in New York. "That could happen quickly and easily. Why hasn't it happened already? That's a fair question." Iger said on a May conference call with investors that he didn't have any plans to stick around past the current date. "The board is very actively engaged in a succession process, as it has been actually for some time," he said. "It believes that it has ample time to identify a successor under timing circumstances that will be just fine for the company." A spokeswoman for Disney declined to comment further. Disney board members on the governance and nominating committee, including former Starbucks Corp. CEO Orin Smith, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and former Clorox Chairman Robert Matschullat, didn't respond or declined to comment. Typically it takes a big public company six to seven months to complete a search once the board begins to contact and interview prospective candidates, though additional time is required before that, said Peter Crist, chairman of Crist Kolder Associates, a boutique search firm outside Chicago. "We do lots of mapping projects with the company that take months" about the qualities it wants and needs in a new CEO, Crist said.

Walt Disney World recently began scanning the fingers of young children at the gates in an effort to identify their tickets and keep them from being reused. Meanwhile, SeaWorld... (Sandra Pedicini) At Wal-Mart Stores, executive recruiter Spencer Stuart began consulting with directors about what the company needed in a new leader and who they should consider about a year before Doug McMillon was named the retailer's CEO in November 2013, according to people familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified because they aren't authorized to talk publicly. The board narrowed its search to two internal candidates, McMillon and former head of U.S. operations Bill Simon, about six months before making its final decision. At Procter & Gamble, directors first started talking about replacing then-CEO Bob MacDonald in July 2012 and then asked A.G. Lafley to return as CEO and chairman in May 2013. Lafley, who'd already served as CEO at P&G from 2000 until 2009, immediately reorganized the company into four businesses, each headed by a president who was considered a contender for the CEO post. One of the four, David Taylor, was named global president of home care and subsequently also took charge of P&G's beauty business. In July 2015, Lafley and P&G's other directors named Taylor the consumer giant's new CEO, concluding the two-year process. Iger himself was promoted in 2005 after a six-month search by the board. The executive, who had led Disney's TV operations and international business and had served as president for five years, was evaluated against external candidates with help from Heidrick & Struggles, directors said at the time. He got the top job only after a high-profile campaign by some shareholders to oust then-CEO Michael Eisner. Former directors in a long-running feud with the company still criticized Iger's selection as hasty, but the board said it had been thorough and careful. Until this year, it looked as if Disney's choice for Iger's successor would be more orderly, with a seasoned executive waiting in the wings in the COO position. Staggs had risen to the No. 2 spot at the company after a five-year period in which he and another senior manager, Jay Rasulo, competed with each other to become Iger's successor, even switching jobs to give Staggs more experience operating a business and Rasulo exposure to the executive suite. Rasulo, then serving as chief financial officer, left the company last year after Staggs's promotion to COO. Staggs's exit, after failing to gain the full backing of Iger and the board, left no other internal candidate with both operational experience and a corporate role. Of the six CEOs since Disney's founding in 1923, only Eisner came from the outside. Eisner, who served from 1984 to 2005, joined the company from Paramount Pictures, where he was president. While the board contemplates who will lead the company after June 2018, Iger remains active in planning how to shape Disney's future. In recent weeks, he considered buying Twitter, but decided to pass, partly because of price and partly because of concern about bullying on the social-media site, people familiar with the matter said last month. At an October event in Boston, Iger said it wasn't enough for the company to own key brands like ABC, ESPN and Pixar. Disney needs to have a direct connection to consumers through mobile devices, he said. "What we're thinking about a lot is what role does technology have in distributing from us to the consumer?" he said. "How must we invest in that?" In its search for Iger's replacement, Disney's board should be casting a wide net, looking for candidates inside and outside the company, particularly ones with high-tech chops, said Paul Winum, a senior partner at the management consulting firm RHR International and co-author of "Inside CEO Succession." "The landscape is changing so rapidly, technology is opening up new distribution platforms, overseas markets will be a huge opportunities," he said. "The leadership skills have changed dramatically just in the last two years." When a CEO succession plan unravels, as it did at Disney, the company usually starts thinking about the next, younger generation of executives inside, giving them bigger and different kinds of experience to prepare them for the top job, said Joseph L. Bower, a Harvard Business School professor who has studied succession planning. Disney hasn't made any major changes recently to suggest it's grooming anyone internally, however. "Disney isn't in trouble and currently has a strong CEO in place," Bower said. "But you don't want someone to come in at the last minute to take over."

Watches! By Todd Plummer • 11/02/16 11:01am Braun is dedicated to branching out into design. Courtesy Braun In the sleepy German village of Kronberg, about an hour’s drive from Frankfurt, Braun is housed in a quiet campus of elegant glass buildings, a stark contrast against the rural and pastoral landscape. Something about being far from a major urban or industrial area speaks to the Braun brand motto: Less But Better. Out here, there are fewer distractions, and the hundreds of engineers, marketers and, of course, designers have more breathing space to think of the next great generation of Braun products. In America, Braun is recognized for two things: electronic shavers (which are not as popular stateside as they are in Europe, as most men here prefer a good-old wet shave) and their Oral-B electronic toothbrushes. For the first time this fall, however, Braun is launching a complete offering of watches. Though the brand had dipped their toes in the category with a model or two over the last couple of seasons, this newly expanded line features a classic minimalist design ethos. Bands come in either sleek leather or stainless steel, and the faces skew towards the classic Braun alarm clock style with Helvetica numbers, or slightly more chronographic, for timepiece connoisseurs. Competitively priced between $200 and $800, there is something here for everyone. Benjamin Wilson, a designer by trade and Braun’s Global Scientific Communicator, pointed out the obvious to the Observer: in the age of smartphones, people don’t necessarily need watches anymore. “It’s more of an object of designer or want,” he said. “It’s part of your style and says something about your taste and who you are as a person. That’s where Braun comes into play—the watches are not over the top, they don’t scream ‘Look at me!’ And they connect directly back to our motto, Less But Better.” Look at that simple detail. Courtesy Braun The move into watches comes at an interesting time for Braun, which for the last couple of years has been quietly repositioning itself as a full-blown design brand. The interesting thing is that this isn’t a novel move for Braun, but more of a return to their roots. Founded in 1921 by Max Braun, the brand primarily focused on radios for the first thirty years or so. This was during WWII and the early part of the mid-twentieth century, when radios were the centerpieces of living rooms around the world. In the 1950’s, Braun expanded into kitchen appliances, coffee makers, their now-iconic shavers, clocks and radios; through the 1970’s, Braun remained as one of the world’s leading industrial design brands. Things began to change in 1984 when Gillette Group acquired Braun. For the next twenty years or so, Braun appeared to be thriving, but profitability became a clear issue. Globalization changed how household products were made, and suddenly, it became much more fashionable for Braun’s competitors to mimic their uniquely minimal design aesthetic and produce products in cheaper places around the world. In 2005, Gillette sold its interest in Braun to Proctor & Gamble, which, in a move to focus on raising profits, discontinued sales of all Braun products in North America except for shavers and electric toothbrushes (hence why Americans today feel like these are Braun’s most familiar categories). The Braun installation at the London Design Festival. Courtesy Braun Lately, it feels like Braun has been making a concerted effort to return to its truest form. This year, Braun was a leading sponsor of the new London Design Festival, a weeklong event celebrating the best in industrial and product design. They collaborated with award-winning designer Benjamin Walker on “Foil,” a 20-meter long undulating ribbon created from Braun stainless steel, in pieces that resembled razor blades. It was installed in the long tapestry room at the Victoria & Albert Museum. Their interaction in the festival was part of a larger effort to bring Braun’s commitment and history of design to the forefront, so people stop perceiving them as just purveyors of shavers and toothbrushes. “In our world,” said Wilson, “the design and engineering that takes place behind the scenes is almost intangible—the consumer can’t see it, can’t touch it. The platform that the London Design Festival produced with us and the Braun Foil installation that we created started a great dialogue for people outside of the design community. For those that got to experience the combination of a tech tapestry in 2016 in contrast to 1000 year old tapestries that were hanging on the walls, it was quite an engaging and emotional experience.” That said, shavers remain a strong category — the Series 9, which was released this year, is wildly popular and has been met with nearly-flawless reviews from the grooming world. The watches have been met with similar enthusiasm, both from critics and retailers, including MR PORTER, alike. It’s an interesting time for Braun, and appears to be a make-or-break moment for the brand. As Wilson explained, if the shavers can perform well, then so can other categories. “I wouldn’t say that the shavers themselves influence the other categories, but more so the industrial design and manufacturing processes play a key role in informing our design today. We call this taking the past forward, which, as it says, takes elements, materials, and processes from the past, reinterprets them, and integrates them as important elements in the products of tomorrow… If there’s an unmet need in our consumer’s life, we will create something to help solve that problem.” This is not a shaver, nor a toothbrush. Courtesy Braun Whether Braun can return to its midcentury glory days remains to be seen, but with the careful and calculated move into watches — applying their iconic minimalist ethos to must-have products that feel right for 2016 — it would seem that they are on the right track.

India Cosmetic Market Outlook, 2021   Spread the Word: News By Tag: * Apparels & Lifestyle * India Cosmetics Market * Outlook By Industry: * ConsumerVADODARA, India - Nov. 2, 2016 - PRLog -- In the cosmetics and beauty sector, there have been sweeping changes. Expensive international beauty products are selling rapidly as the Indian women are investing in long term beauty. The biggest beauty evolution in India's recent past, however, is not restricted to women. Men have taken to healthier skin routine, away from the gym. The rise in men's salons is evidence to the fact that men want more beauty for themselves. The menu cards on offer at men's salons include treatments that were earlier meant for women. Men's salons have now started offering a multitude of beauty services while beauty brands now have a special product line-up dedicated specifically for men's grooming. As per ASSOCHAM, the per capita consumption of cosmetics in India is approximately US$ 0.68 cents as compared to US$ 40 in Hong Kong, US$ 12 in Japan, and US$ 1.5 in China. Consumption of these products centers on young women, with the age group 15-44 years accounting for about 70% of the market. Consumption begins in the teens and tapers off after 45, and declines substantially after 55. According to recently published report of Bonafide Research "India Cosmetic Market Outlook, 2021", cosmetic market in India was growing with a CAGR of 17.06% over past few years. The urban population with increasing purchasing power is the major force driving demand for cosmetic products. India is a very price-sensitive market and mass-market products constitute the major part of the cosmetics market. Urban India leads the market, with more than four-fifth of the cosmetic segment consumption by volume. However, rural consumption exceeds urban consumption in toilet soaps and is almost equal to urban sales of hair oil, the lowest end of the hair care market. Many domestic and international companies are now targeting the rural markets to push volume sales in categories like lip and nail care, and some mass skin care products as well. Meanwhile, urban consumption is evolving, moving from basic functional to more superior and specialized products, and greater expenditure levels. Moreover, there is a rise in consumption of men's products, including skin care products, which were earlier considered purely the woman's sphere. The dominant international players include Hindustan UniLever, the subsidiary of Unilever with all its international and Indian brands, L'Oreal, along with its subsidiary Maybelline and Garnier brands, Revlon, Nivea, Biersdorf, Schwarzkopf, Palmolive, and Proctor & Gamble including Gillette. Lakmé as a brand dominates the cosmetic industry in India, owned by Unilever. Stiff competition has resulted in an increase in the range of new products being introduced for newer application concepts in the last few years. In the skin-care segment, from just creams and moisturizers, there has been an upgrade to value-added products such as under eye wrinkle removing creams, dark circle removing creams toners, sunscreen lotions, fairness creams, and many more. The colour cosmetics market saw new products such as smudge-proof lipsticks and mascaras, liquid lip colour, and long-lasting lipsticks being introduced. However, low and medium-priced categories account for almost 85-90% of the cosmetics market in terms of volume.

Skip to content Military Technologies pr @ satprnews.com Clorox Reports Q1 Fiscal Year 2017 Results, Including Strong Sales Growth; Updates Fiscal Year Tax-Rate Assumptions for EPS Outlook “As we look to the remainder of the fiscal year, I feel good about the health of our core business and am confident in the strategic plans we have in place in the face of a challenging macro-economic environment,” continued Dorer. All results in this press release are reported on a continuing operations basis, unless otherwise stated. Some information in this release is reported on a non-GAAP basis. See “Non-GAAP Financial Information” below and the tables toward the end of this press release for more information and reconciliations of key first-quarter fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2016 results to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP). Fiscal First-Quarter Results Following is a summary of key first-quarter results. All comparisons are with the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, unless otherwise stated. 8% volume growth 4% sales growth $1.36 diluted EPS (3% increase) In the first quarter, volume grew 8 percent, reflecting increases in all reportable segments, including the benefit of the RenewLife digestive health business, which was acquired in May 2016. Total company sales grew 4 percent, driven by strong volume growth, including 2 points from the RenewLife business, and the benefit of price increases in the company’s international business. These factors were partially offset by unfavorable mix and 2 points of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Clorox delivered earnings from continuing operations of $179 million, or $1.36 diluted EPS, compared to $173 million, or $1.32 diluted EPS, in the year-ago quarter. First-quarter diluted EPS results reflect higher sales and the benefit of cost savings, partially offset by higher manufacturing and logistics costs and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. First-quarter diluted EPS also reflects a 4-cent benefit from the adoption of the Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09, which was recently issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, addressing the accounting of employee share-based payments. This benefit, which is reflected in a lower tax rate in the first quarter versus year ago, was less than anticipated as fewer stock options were exercised by employees. The company had previously communicated that the benefit realized from the adoption of this accounting standard could vary significantly given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future share-based transactions. The company’s updated outlook for the full-year impact of ASU 2016-09 is presented later in this press release. The company’s first-quarter gross margin decreased 60 basis points to 44.4 percent from 45 percent in the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by higher manufacturing and logistics costs impacted by ongoing inflationary pressure and the timing of strategic investments to support growth and cost savings initiatives, unfavorable mix and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. These factors were partially offset by the benefits of cost savings, favorable commodity costs and price increases. First-quarter net cash provided by continuing operations was $170 million, compared with $135 million in the year-ago period. The year-over-year increase reflects higher tax payments in the year-ago period. Key Segment Results Following is a summary of key first-quarter results from continuing operations by reportable segment. All comparisons are with the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, unless otherwise stated. Cleaning (Laundry, Home Care, Professional Products)              13% volume growth 7% sales growth 10% pretax earnings growth Segment volume growth was driven largely by gains in Home Care, particularly record shipments of Clorox® disinfecting wipes behind expanded club-channel distribution and increased merchandising support for the back-to-school season. Record shipments across a number of Clorox-branded products, including toilet bowl cleaners and disinfecting spray products, also contributed to segment volume results. Professional Products also contributed to segment volume growth, reflecting strong gains across cleaning brands. The variance between volume and sales growth was due to unfavorable mix. Pretax earnings growth reflected higher sales and cost savings. Household (Bags and Wraps, Charcoal, Cat Litter, Digestive Health) 6% volume growth 3% sales growth 16% pretax earnings decrease Segment volume growth was driven primarily by the benefit of the RenewLife acquisition, partially offset by lower shipments in Charcoal, which grew volume by 6 percent in the year-ago quarter. Segment sales also increased, but trailed volume growth reflecting higher trade promotion spending, which included spending in Bags and Wraps to address competitive activity and in Cat Litter to support the Fresh Step® with Febreze innovation. Pretax earnings decreased driven by lower Charcoal volume, higher trade promotion spending and higher manufacturing and logistics costs. These factors were partially offset by the benefit of favorable commodity costs. Lifestyle (Dressings and Sauces, Water Filtration, Natural Personal Care) 1% volume growth 2% sales growth 5% pretax earnings growth Segment volume growth was driven primarily by gains in Natural Personal Care behind innovation in Burt’s Bees® lip color products. Sales outpaced volume primarily due to lower trade promotion spending. Pretax earnings growth reflected higher sales and the benefits of cost savings and favorable commodity costs, partially offset by higher manufacturing and logistics costs. International   (Sales outside of the U.S.) 4% volume increase Flat sales (10% growth, currency-neutral basis) 16% pretax earnings decrease Segment volume results were driven primarily by gains in Canada, reflecting base business growth and the benefit of the RenewLife acquisition, as well as growth in the Burt’s Bees business in Asia, partially offset by decreases in select Latin America countries, notably Argentina. Volume outpaced flat sales, largely due to the impact of 10 percentage points of unfavorable foreign currency exchanges rates, partially offset by price increases. Excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, segment sales grew 10 percent. Pretax earnings decreased, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and inflationary pressure on higher manufacturing and logistics costs. These factors were partially offset by the benefit of price increases. Clorox Updates Fiscal Year 2017 EPS Outlook for Revised Tax Rate Assumptions; Expectations For Sales Growth and EBIT Margin Expansion Remain Unchanged 2% to 4% sales growth (unchanged) 25 basis points to 50 basis points of EBIT margin expansion (unchanged) $5.23 to $5.43 diluted EPS range (updated for ASU 2016-09 impact) $5.13 to $5.28, excluding ASU 2016-09 impact (unchanged) Clorox continues to anticipate delivering 2 percent to 4 percent sales growth in fiscal year 2017, reflecting about 2 percentage points of benefit from the RenewLife acquisition, partially offset by about 2 percentage points of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of 2 percentage points from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, the company continues to anticipate fiscal year sales to grow between 4 to 6 percent. Clorox continues to anticipate EBIT margin expansion for fiscal year 2017 to be in the range of 25 to 50 basis points, primarily driven by lower selling and administrative expenses, which are expected to be below 14 percent of sales. Clorox now anticipates its effective fiscal year 2017 tax rate to be between 32 percent and 33 percent versus its previous assumption of 30 percent and 31 percent, reflecting a 2-point reduction versus year ago compared to the previously assumed 4-point reduction from adopting ASU 2016-09. The company’s updated assumptions for its fiscal year effective tax rate reflect lower than anticipated exercises of Clorox stock options in the first quarter and the company’s revised outlook for full-year stock option exercises. As noted, the company had previously communicated that the benefit to be realized from the adoption of ASU 2016-19 could vary significantly. Net of all these factors, Clorox now anticipates fiscal year 2017 diluted EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.23 to $5.43, which includes the updated assumption of 10 to 15 cents of benefit to fiscal year EPS from adopting the accounting standards update. Excluding the benefit of adopting the accounting standards update, Clorox continues to anticipate fiscal year 2017 diluted EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.13 to $5.28. FY17 Outlook as of Aug. 3, 2016 as of Nov. 2, 2016 Diluted EPS, excluding ASU $5.13 to $5.28 $5.13 to $5.28 ASU 2016-09 benefit $0.25 to $0.30 $0.10 to $0.15 Diluted EPS Outlook $5.38 to $5.58 $5.23 to $5.43 For More Detailed Financial Information Visit the company’s Financial Information: Quarterly Results section of the company’s website at TheCloroxCompany.com for the following: Supplemental unaudited volume and sales growth information Supplemental unaudited gross margin driver information Supplemental unaudited reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial information, including earnings from continuing operations before interest and taxes (EBIT) and earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) Supplemental unaudited balance sheet and cash flow information and free cash flow reconciliation Supplemental price-change information Note: Percentage and basis-point changes noted in this press release are calculated based on rounded numbers.

The Skin Advisor app, which is already available in the USA and will be coming very soon to the UK, analyses your skin, asks questions about your skincare habits and suggests products to help improve the texture, hydration and tone of your face.  'How can we help?' asks the app solicitously as it loads up the bare-faced picture that I have taken. I cut to the chase and ask it to choose the right products for me. That’s a tough ask for a human expert, unless they know a lot about your skin. But this app is going to have a go, using ‘deep learning’ - a machine-learning algorithm inspired by the way the human brain works. "The app has learned to perceive age and skin flaws by being shown tens of thousands of ageing faces look like," explains Jun Xu, one of the team who created the app at the Procter & Gamble’s Beauty Technology headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio. It learns from its mistakes; slightly scarily, the Skin Advisor now has a better success rate at guessing age from a face than expert dermatologists, who do this sort of thing the whole time. Anti-ageing skincare tips It’s the first time the deep learning algorithm has been used in skincare; other age-predicting programmes such as Microsoft’s ‘How Old do I Look’ facial recognition software, which came under fire last week when it was used to judge, often inaccurately, the ages of child migrants arriving in the UK, use a less sophisticated form of machine learning. After quizzing me about my skincare habits and concerns the app makes its analysis - my forehead is looking good (that may be the Botox) but my mouth area needs help. The verdict: I need a lifting, firming, all-round day cream with SPF from the Regenerist range, the Olay Regenerist 3-Point moisturiser SPF30, £19.99. I love it. Not least because when it eventually comes up with my age, it thinks I’m 40.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries E-edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site 1985-Present 1831-1950 Illinois comptroller race in spotlight with budget fight Tuesday Nov 1, 2016 at 5:12 PM Nov 1, 2016 at 5:12 PM By Sophia Tareen, The Associated Press CHICAGO -- The race for comptroller, usually a low-profile contest coinciding with Illinois' gubernatorial campaigns, is in the spotlight during a presidential year with a big money special election offering Democrats an unusual chance to oust Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner's hand-picked candidate. The office that controls Illinois' checkbook is open mid-term because incumbent Leslie Munger's appointment is expiring. Rauner named her after Republican Judy Baar Topinka died after her 2014 re-election and Democrats in charge pushed a law requiring a 2016 special election. Munger is vying to keep the job against Democrat Susana Mendoza, Chicago's city clerk aligned with the influential speaker of the Illinois House, and Green Party and Libertarian candidates. The Nov. 8 winner will finish out the last half of the term. The job The comptroller post has been obscure, with perpetual talk of merging it with the treasurer's office, which oversees investments. But it's recently played a more prominent role with Illinois' unprecedented budget gridlock. The office balances laws, court orders and lawmaker-authorized spending to prioritize who gets paid, from state workers to utility companies to social service providers. The office can also be used as a bully pulpit to urge change, something that could impact the administration in power. Illinois' first GOP governor in over a decade remains deadlocked on a full spending plan with Democrats controlling the Legislature. They oppose Rauner's union-weakening, pro-business agenda as a condition to a budget with new taxes. The impasse has complicated the comptroller's job: Some social service providers have closed their doors because of the uncertainty, while others doing business with Illinois are still awaiting payment as the backlog of unpaid bills hovers around $9 billion. The candidates Like several legislative races, the comptroller election has become a proxy war in the battle between Rauner and House Speaker Michael Madigan, who serves as the Democratic Party's leader. Mendoza and Munger have cast themselves as independent from their party leaders, but they've also benefited from their backing. Munger, who called herself Rauner's "budgetary wingman," supports his agenda and took millions in donations from the former venture capitalist and his allies. But she insists she's stood up to Rauner. She delayed paychecks for elected officials during the impasse, and defied his request to not pay public-employee unions the "fair share" dues her office deducts from state worker paychecks. Mendoza, a former legislator, says she's also created waves within her party. She once challenged a Madigan-backed candidate and publicly disagreed with Mayor Rahm Emanuel as clerk when he pitched raising the price of parking permits. But she voted with House Democrats on spending plans and has publicly praised the speaker, include during a 2011 ceremony nominating him to the post he's held almost continuously since 1983. The money The race has also featured extraordinary fundraising. Munger has raised more than double what Mendoza has, mostly due to gigantic donations from wealthy businessmen supporting Rauner. Since 2015's start, Munger collected nearly $9 million, with $1 million from Rauner, $2 million from businessman Richard Uihlein and $5 million from Citadel CEO Ken Griffin. Munger transferred $3 million to the Republican Party, which is pouring money into legislative battles to reduce Democratic supermajorities. Mendoza raised about $3.5 million in the same time period. Roughly one-third comes from unions and a smaller sum from a Democratic Party fund controlled by Madigan. The campaign The two faced off in one televised debate where both interrupted each other often as they defended their records. Munger claimed her opponent voted "in lockstep" with Madigan and her campaign donations come from special interests. She defended her own campaign fund as support from people who want to improve Illinois. "The governor has not bought me," she said on Chicago's WTTW. But Mendoza said the contributions make Munger a "wholly-owned subsidiary" of Rauner. She defended her budget votes as preserving funding for people in need. "I feel like I'm running against Governor Rauner right now," Mendoza said afterward. "The minute he bought the office, it became a proxy between him and myself." *** Leslie Geissler Munger, 60, Lincolnshire, Republican Family: Married, two sons Education: University of Illinois, B.A.; Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, M.B.A. Occupation and experience: After making an unsuccessful bid for the Illinois House in 2014, she was appointed Illinois comptroller, her first public office.

On term limits: "Term limits and redistricting reform are essential for ensuring more accountable government in Springfield." On the budget gridlock: "We can't just cut our way to a balanced budget - we also need new revenue.

This research report titled 'Baby Diaper Market in MEA 2016-2020' provides an in-depth analysis of the market in terms of revenue and emerging market trends. The report discusses the major drivers that are influencing market growth and the challenges faced by vendors and the market as a whole. Increasing urbanization and rise in disposable income in MEA are the major reasons for the growth of the market. Every year, the urban population is increasing by 3.5% in Africa, and by 4% in the Middle East. There has been an increase in the number of expats in the Middle East due to the opportunities for high income. In addition, people living in urban areas are more aware of hygiene issues and are thus opting for baby diapers. Also, the birth rate in MEA is on the rise, leading to a high demand for baby diapers in the region. Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=54172 Technavio's sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. Technavio's analysts categorize the baby diaper market in MEA into five major segments by product. They are: Disposable diapers Training diapers Cloth diapers Swim pant diapers Biodegradable diapers The top three product segments for the baby diaper market in MEA are: Disposable baby diaper market in MEA An increase in number of dual-income households that are opting for disposable baby diapers because of the convenience they offer, and growing awareness of the importance of maintaining hygiene for babies, are some of the factors driving the demand for disposable baby diapers across the globe. However, in Africa, the demand for disposable baby diapers is still limited. The rural population, which forms more than 59% of the total population, cannot afford disposable baby diapers and hence the demand is low. According to Abhay Sinha, a lead analyst from Technavio, "Even in the urban areas, the usage is still limited due to low awareness and low disposable income. The introduction of innovative materials such as superabsorbent fibers and engineered fabrics, coupled with advances in product design and low cost, will boost the sales of disposable baby diapers in the region during the forecast period Training baby diaper market in MEA Training baby diapers are gaining popularity in developing countries. Most training baby diapers have flexible sides that can be easily pulled down by a baby, and therefore aid in toilet training. These diapers are designed like underwear and are increasingly being used to help children switch from using diapers to using toilets. Training baby diapers are usually used for toddlers of two years or more. The demand for training baby diapers is expected to increase mainly from the working-class women, who find it more convenient to use these diapers, compared with cloth baby diapers, and from people who can afford and continue to buy diapers even after the baby is more than two years of age. The demand for such diapers is expected to be low from the rural parts of Africa, since people in the region cannot afford to buy diapers and usually stop buying them after the baby is more than two years. Cloth baby diaper market in MEA Cloth baby diapers are low-priced, can be reused, and are eco-friendly. They are also safe for a baby's skin as they do not have any harmful chemical ingredients. Most fitted diapers come with Velcro straps. This eliminates the need to use pins, which are potentially hurtful. Cloth baby diapers are popular in most developing countries due to their low costs. Although in recent times, the market for fitted cloth diapers has lost its share to other categories of diapers, some consumers still prefer them as they are both economical and eco-friendly. "The demand in the cloth baby diaper market is expected to come from the rural population in Africa, which cannot afford disposable baby diapers. Cloth baby diapers are also popular in the Middle East. There is a new trend of cloth baby diaper libraries emerging in the region," asserts Abhay. The top vendors highlighted by Technavio's research analysts in this report are: Kimberly-Clark P&G SCA Unicharm Browse Related Reports: Global Diaper Market 2016-2020 Adult Diapers Market in the Americas 2015-2019 Adult Diaper Market in the APAC 2015-2019 Do you need a report on a market in a specific geographical cluster or country but can't find what you're looking for?

X West Virginia governor eyes Irish strategy in post-coal era Governor Earl Ray Tomblin attracts investment as coal production declines Tue, Nov 1, 2016, 17:00 Charlie Taylor Governor of West Virginia Earl Ray Tomblin: “Ireland has done a great job in setting competitive prices and we’re trying to do more of that.” Photograph: Jim Stem/Bloomberg         Donald Trump has made plenty of outlandish promises during the US presidential campaign. A vow to bring back coal mining jobs to West Virginia might not rank among the worst of them, but it has certainly led to a headache for the state’s governor. Earl Ray Tomblin, a Democrat who was has been governor of West Virginia since November 2011, is involved in a concerted effort to encourage international investors to the state as it seeks to diversify away from coal. However, Trump’s commitment to reopen mines has gone down well with disillusioned voters who do not hold out much hope for Tomblin’s promise of a brighter tomorrow. With a poverty rate of 18.5 per cent, West Virginia is ranked among the poorest states in the US and, while there are many who dismiss Trump’s mining pledge as a fantasy, there are many who are attracted to it. “Coal has taken care of people in this state for generations, from the time they left school to their graves, but those days are gone and some people don’t want to believe it,” Tomblin tells The Irish Times on a recent visit to Dublin. “I hate it as much as they do because I come from a mining region, but there’s no magic wand that can be waved that will put miners back to work, which is why there is little choice other than to try to diversify.” West Virginia may not be particularly well known to most people in Ireland but politicians there sure know a lot about us. The US state is looking to Ireland as a role model as it seeks to move away from coal and encourage companies in other sectors to set up shop in the region. “We’ve learned that there are a lot of similarities between Ireland and West Virginia,” Tomblin says. “Ireland has very smartly been able to successfully position itself as a small country in a very big economy. We are trying to do something similar by repositioning our economy away from coal. I think we have the assets to do it.” ADVERTISEMENT West Virginia historically has thrived on traditional energy and manufacturing industries such as chemicals and polymers, aerospace, automotive and wood products. However, the state is increasingly seeking to attract innovative, technology-based businesses that will provide a more sustainable economic future. Lower energy prices, technological improvements in the oil and gas space, and tougher environmental laws mean that West Virginia has no choice but to make itself less dependent on coal. However, with the energy sector still accounting for about 17 per cent of the state’s GDP – even after the closure of many mines and a 40 per cent drop in exports – saying goodbye to the black stuff isn’t easy. According to the Energy Information Agency, West Virginia ranked fourth among all states in total energy production in 2013, producing 4.6 per cent of the nation’s total. The state currently provides 15 per cent of the entire US coal supply. However, production has declined sharply in recent years, from a peak of 158 million tonnes in 2008 to a projected 73 million tonnes this year. “We realise that we’ve got to change but that takes a little bit of time,” Tomblin says. “Everyone still associates West Virginia with energy; it is like the 800lb elephant in the room. It is there and we would to be idiots not to continue to take advantage of the resources we have. But we have also become a more diversified economy in recent years.” Since 2005, West Virginia has seen more than $22 billion in new business investments. More than 140 global companies now have operations in the State with firms such as Amazon, Bayer, Toyota, Procter & Gamble, Macy’s and Lockheed Martin among them. Irish firms such as Ardagh Group, CRH/Oldcastle Precast and Randox Laboratories also have a presence there. The state is seeking to further boost investment, hence the trade mission to Britain and Ireland. “Ireland has done a great job in setting competitive prices and we’re trying to do more of that,” the governor adds. “We’ve reduced business taxes from 9.5 per cent to 6 per cent in recent years, introduced programmes to retrain people, and like Ireland, have tried to create flexibility and stability so that companies considering West Virginia know what to expect. “We don’t see Ireland as a competitor but as a country we can learn from. We’ve paid a lot of attention to what it has done to attract international investment and during this visit have met with the IDA to discuss what we have in common and how we can work closer together to benefit both sides.” Emerging sectors in West Virginia include plastics, biometrics and biosciences, advanced energy, distribution and business and information services. It is also doing more to promote tourism in the region and has become something of a hub for government agencies who want to be close to Washington but far enough away in case of a terrorist attack. “The federal government has been moving critical operations to states like West Virginia, which is only 45 minutes away by air and a couple of hours away by road. The US treasury has a major presence here, as does the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA)]and the FBI, through which we have the largest fingerprint repository in the US.” Nonetheless, with so many job losses arising from the mining sector and not enough new ones to go around as yet, Tomblin’s strategy has not met with widespread praise. The Democrat recently risked further ire by voicing his support for Hillary Clinton for president, in a state that has shown strong support for her opponent. ADVERTISEMENT “Trump will carry West Virginia but we’ll have a Democratic governor for the state and a Democratic president,” he says. The incumbent, who is not running for re-election due to term limits, may be exasperated by Trump’s comments, but he says that in terms of investment opportunities, they are more of a distraction than a threat. “There’s been plenty of anti-trade talk in these elections but I’d say you guys have bigger worries with Brexit than we do with Trump.”       Topics: Donald Trump Earl Ray Tomblin Hillary Clinton Energy Information Agency Fbi IDA Ireland National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration Amazon Ardagh Bayer CRH Lockheed Martin Macy's Procter and Gamble Randox Laboratories Toyota Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Markets Goodbody warns of Trump’s ‘beggar thy neighbour’ plans Work Pre-meetings key to successful meetings on contentious issues Gaelic Games Clare’s Ballyea clinch maiden Munster hurling title Economy Fast-track pay restoration: is it economically feasible?

"Following" : "Follow"}} November 01, 2016 9:56am   Comments Share: Related Benzinga's Top Upgrades Wall Street's M&A Chatter From November 11-13 Related PG Benzinga's Top Initiations The Trump Market Is Killing A Couple Of Popular Trading Strategies Procter & Gamble's (PG) CEO David Taylor Hosts Analyst Day Meeting 2016 (Transcript) (Seeking Alpha) Morgan Stanley’s Dara Mohsenian believes that the weak positioning of Coty Inc (NYSE: COTY) within the beauty industry, along with high execution risks, are already priced into the valuation discount of the stock, compared to its CPG peers. Mohsenian re-initiated coverage of the company with an Equal-Weight rating and price target of $24. Weak Positioning “We continue to view Coty as disadvantaged within the attractive beauty category,” the analyst mentioned, while pointing out that the stock has declined 26 percent from its May peak. Mohsenian expects the stock to continue to be under pressure in the near term, driven by weak top line results, which in turn are expected due to the soft scanner data and distractions due to the Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG) deal. “However, as we move close to the summer of CY17 we do see eventual trading upside as the market focuses more on FY18 at some point and Coty provides greater financial clarity,” the analyst went on to say. Reasons For Weakness Mohsenian believes Coty is skewed to lower growth subcategories and price points in the beauty space than its large public peers. In addition, the company’s brands entail weak brand equity, which is highlighted by Coty’s historical market share losses. According to the Morgan Stanley report, “Coty licenses about 40 percent of its portfolio, which means it deserves a lower valuation for lack of ownership. Working with third parties also makes Coty's portfolio more complex to manage, particularly as the company tries to cull SKUs.” There have been reports that Coty intends to acquire U.K.-based Good Hair Day, a manufacturer of high end hair care products, for significantly more than £400 million. In fact, Moody’s sees this acquisition as credit negative for Coty.

"However, large rooms or distribution centers with poor acoustics also provide issues with audio quality even if there is little or no ambient noise. Employee training in any of these environments certainly benefits from the enhanced audio available with a wireless tour guide system."

Galley's brush with being targeted online for the intent of sex trafficking prompted her to empower girls far beyond her signature GIRL TALK program, giving girls a powerful message that begins with an ordinary blank canvas bag. Galley has a gift - she's showing tween and teen girls how to utilize their inner "Girl Power", improving their confidence and self-esteem with a relatable message. Just recently, she was awarded a Distinguished Service Award by Austin, Texas Mayor Steve Adler for her efforts in building a new revolution of self-worth among young girls on a global scale. "When girls and women empower each other, our 'Girl Power' creates a force that not only shatters glass ceilings, but changes the world," said Girls Above Society President and Founder Lauren Galley. One of Galley's most treasured accomplishments is the establishment of her non-profit organization, Girls Above Society at age fifteen. The organization's GIRL TALK curriculum empowers young girls to become confident and know their self-worth as they face the tough pressures of today's media driven society. "I had the opportunity to connect with Forever Found in Simi-Valley, CA. through the local Soroptimist chapter. I knew this would be a perfect launch for Project Warrior." The hand delivery of these bags launched my goal of reaching girls in every U.S. state," said Galley. Each warrior bag is hand stamped revealing the powerful quote "Throw me to the wolves. I will come back leading the pack." signifying the girl's bravery and strength. The hand painted arrow represents the positive force and direction their lives can lead, giving them a mindset of self-worth and success. The added gold glitter is a reminder to smile and shine...today is a good day. Dana Wendt, CEO and founder of JOUZGE, a Golden Family Company has partnered with Galley dedicating a monetary amount from each treat sold to further impact Project Warrior and it's empowerment of rescued human trafficked girls. Wendt herself is a survivor of childhood sexual abuse and feels this mission is two fold. "Project Warrior benefits the survivors of trafficking as well as bringing awareness to teen girls on what predatory behavior looks like. It is important to understand this is happening every day here in our country, our states, our cities and in our towns. This issue cannot be dismissed. There is a great need here and we believe Project Warrior will succeed in addressing these girls challenges as well as educating girls everywhere about human trafficking," said Wendt. Galley reports a new shipment arrived this week for girls at Vista Maria in Illinois, adding a second state in her quest for all 50. Alpha Delta Pi alumni Karen Banker Collins is the liaison assisting Galley, a current Alpha Delta Pi, in the Illinois warrior bag delivery. Galley's future goals for Project Warrior include adding an extension beyond the warrior bags, awarding girls with educational scholarships that will further advance rescued girls, giving them additional tools to live a successful future, and rise above their tragic past of human trafficking. Lauren Marie Galley is a 21-year-old award winning teen mentor, TEDx Speaker, Amazon Best Selling Author, a recognized 2016 Changemaker by The White House for the State of Women Summit and President of Girls Above Society, a non-profit 501 (c)(3) organization dedicated to empowering tween and teen girls to be confident while maintaining positive morals and values as they face the tough pressures of today's media driven society. Lauren's GIRL TALK curriculum reaches girls as she travels across the U.S. and has officially launched in the Massillon School District 2016-2017 school year. Lauren is a contributor to Huffington Post and can also been seen on TED giving her TEDx Talk titled #TextMe: The Elimination of Human Interaction. This talk gives a powerful look at the effect modern technology has on the shaping of today's youth and their forms of communication. Lauren's Ambassadorship with Secret Deodorant's Mean Stinks Campaign in conjunction with Teen Vogue has given her a powerful platform to continue empowering girls to end the girl-on-girl bullying for good. Proctor & Gamble's "Niceness Pays" $10,000 scholarship was awarded to Lauren in January of 2016. Lauren lives in Texas where she attends Sam Houston State University studying Psychology where she is proud to be the Leadership Chair of Alpha Delta Pi. Her latest scholastic honors ~ Student Excellence Award for Service 2013 and 2014, Rising Leader of Alpha Delta Pi, 2015, Deans List 2015 and Mayor's Distinguished Service Award 2016.
