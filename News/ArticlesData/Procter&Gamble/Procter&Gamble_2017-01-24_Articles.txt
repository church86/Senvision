Is Tackling the E-Commerce Threat P&G recently provided some fresh data on how its online business is holding up against the competition. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Jan 25, 2017 at 4:57PM Procter & Gamble's (NYSE:PG) dominance over the consumer goods industry is at risk as more spending moves online each year. The company doesn't enjoy the same wall-to-wall coverage online, after all, that it does in retail stores, where franchises like Tide and Pampers soak up prime real estate across shopping aisles. The good news for shareholders is that management is aware of the threats and opportunities that come with e-commerce disruptions. Despite recent stumbles as it tried to protect brands like Gillette from online-based rivals, P&G is optimistic that this important sales channel will be a win for the business over time. A $3 billion business E-commerce is now a $3 billion annual business for P&G, which equates to just under 5% of sales. A 40% annual growth rate is helping close the gap between that figure and the 8.4% of total retailing that is now taken up by online spending. E-commerce accounts for over 8% of all retailing, up from 3% in 2006. Image source: Federal Reserve Economic Data. P&G's key partners in this channel include Amazon.com, which competes in some of its strongest categories, and Target, in addition to Wal-Mart, whose retail locations account for 15% of its annual revenue. Holding market share P&G's market-share position online is about equal to its offline results. That means Pampers accounts for about 30% of all digital purchases of diapers around the world, Bounty makes up 40% of all paper towel orders, and the Gillette franchise is responsible for a whopping 65% of the global blades and razors industry. Image source: Getty Images. These products face brutal price-based competition from online-focused rivals, but in most cases their strong brands, supplemented by P&G's aggressive marketing spending, have allowed their retailing positions to translate directly into online dominance. Keeping costs even P&G is working hard to bring costs down to the point that it can generate the same profitability regardless of whether it's through an online sale or a traditional retailing purchase. The company has managed impressive wins on this score by cutting $1.5 billion out of annual operating expenses over the past five years. PG Cost of Goods Sold (TTM) data by YCharts. P&G expects to generate even bigger savings over the next few years by slicing an average of $2 billion out of annual costs through 2021. Winning markets Executives highlighted two markets where P&G is enjoying especially strong results online. In China that channel is on pace to reach 20% of its business and should soon pass $1 billion in annual sales. Website orders account for 40% of revenue in Korea, too, where P&G has had success pushing subscription services for high-volume products like diapers and razors. The company isn't likely to achieve anything close to these figures in the $28 billion U.S. segment. However, China is its second-largest market, and so it represents an attractive picture for the direction that its other key geographies should move. In its 10-K report, P&G lists "failure to effectively compete" in the e-commerce sales channel as one of its biggest operating risks. That concern will only grow as online sales pass 10% of overall retailing and keep climbing. Executives know there will always be a place for physical stores. They're more convenient for meeting needs quickly, or for shoppers aiming to handle errands, like gas refills, banking, and pharmacy trips, that aren't confined to product purchases. Yet P&G understands that it can't fall behind in a business that's already a huge sales generator in many of its most important markets.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search Procter & Gamble’s Blockbuster Earnings Bode Well For Consumer Staples ETF January 25, 2017 7:46am NYSE:XLP ShareTweet From Zacks: One of the most famous names in the consumer products world – Procter & Gamble (PG – Free Report) – gave investors sweet surprises on January 20, 2017 by beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and sales in second-quarter fiscal 2017. In addition, the company’s projection on organic sales contained an upbeat tone. This positive news came at an awful time for the consumer staples space with most ETFs carrying a sell or strong sell rating. Let’s delve a little deeper and see if PG’s strong numbers can do any good to the sector. Procter & Gamble’s 2Q17 Earnings in Focus The consumer staple giant’s 2Q17 adjusted earnings of $1.08 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06 by 1.9%. The bottom line also increased 3.8% from the prior-year quarter on higher margins. Currency-neutral core EPS improved 9%. P&G’s reported net sales of $16.86 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.8 billion by 0.3%. The top line, however, remained unchanged year over year. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of 2% on sales (read: ETFs & Stocks Unfazed by Softer December Retail Sales). Organically (excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange), revenues grew 2% on the back of a 2% increase in organic volumes. All the five business segments recorded positive organic sales growth. Core gross margin expanded 70 bps to 51.5% as productivity cost savings and higher volume benefits were offset by headwinds like unfavorable mix and commodity cost increases. Management expects organic sales growth of about 2–3% compared with 2% projected earlier for fiscal 2017. However, the company now expects the combined foreign exchange headwind and minor brand divestitures to hurt sales by about 2–3% (predicted 1% earlier). Hence, P&G expects all-in sales growth to remain flat for fiscal 2017. Consumer ETF Impact Thanks to an upbeat earnings release, shares of PG notched up about 3.3% in the key trading session of January 20, 2017 on over two times higher trading volumes. The gain also reflected in the ETF world, with consumer staples funds being benefited moderately. Many of the key funds in this segment have a double-digit allocation to the consumer product giant, suggesting that the performance of the fund is highly dependent on P&G’s performance. Let’s take a look at the following three ETFs with a solid allocation to Procter & Gamble (read: Consumer Staples ETF Investing 101): Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund ((XLP – Free Report) ) The most popular consumer ETF on the market, XLP, follows the S&P Consumer Staples Select Sector Index. The fund invests about $8.29 billion of assets in 37 holdings. Of these firms, the in-focus P&G takes the first spot, making up roughly 13% of the assets. The fund has returned about 0.7% on January 20, 2017 (see all consumer staples ETFs here). Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC – Free Report) This fund manages a $4.0 billion asset base and provides exposure to a basket of 103 consumer stocks. The product charges a low fee of 10 bps per year from investors. Here too, P&G is the top firm with 10.5% allocation. VDC advanced about 0.6% on January 20, 2017. iShares U.S. Consumer Goods ETF (IYK – Free Report) This ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Consumer Goods Index, giving investors exposure to the broad consumer staples space. The fund holds about 117 stocks in its basket with AUM of $542.3 million. Like the other two, the stock under consideration occupies the top position in the basket with 10.5% of assets. The fund gained over 0.7% on January 20. Bottom Line Even though PG had a favorable day, its impact on the rest of the consumer staples market wasn’t as solid as some might expect. Yes, all of the major consumer staples ETFs were up, but their gains were not profuse. After all, the wind is not in favor of the sector. With bond yields rising, its high-dividend appeal continues to fade. Consumer staples had a morbid good run in the last one month, but if PG’s outlook is any guide, the sector has still something to offer. However, to come to any conclusion, we need to keep a track on earnings of other staples giants (read: Consumer ETFs in Focus as Wal-Mart Misses Q3 Revenue). The Consumer Staples Select Sect. SPDR ETF (NYSE:XLP) was unchanged in premarket trading Wednesday. Year-to-date, XLP has gained 2.32%, versus a 1.82% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. XLP currently has an ETF Daily News SMART Grade of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #2 of 46 ETFs in the Consumer-Focused ETFs category. This article is brought to you courtesy of Zacks Research.

Consumer goods giant P&G has become the latest company to attempt to show it is tackling the problem, announcing plans for a limited run of Head & Shoulders shampoo in bottles made partly from plastic waste collected by volunteers on France’s beaches. It follows the likes of Adidas, which put 7,000 pairs of trainers made from marine plastics on sale in November, and Pharrell Williams, whose clothing line for G-Star RAW has featured denim containing plastic from the oceans. Ecover, which sells cleaning products, has produced several limited edition bottles, using marine plastics from the North Sea and waste collected from Amsterdam’s canals. Saskia van Gendt, head of sustainability for Europe at Ecover, says it plans to launch new packaging later this year with plastic collected from UK beaches by environmental charity Surfers Against Sewage. Wooden surfboards to mushroom handplanes: the surf companies tackling ocean waste – gallery Read more P&G expects to manufacture up to 170,000 of their special edition bottle, produced in collaboration with recycling business TerraCycle and waste management firm Suez. That may be the biggest deployment of marine and beach plastic ever, according to TerraCycle CEO Tom Szaky, but it still represents less than 0.6% of the 29m bottles of Head & Shoulders P&G was reported in 2011 to be selling every year. However, Steve Morgan, technical director at plastics recycling network Recoup, says the level of recycled content in the beach plastic shampoo bottles – up to 25% according to P&G – makes the initiative a “technological breakthrough”, despite its limited size. “In the past when companies have tried to use plastics that have been sourced from oceans or beaches, it hasn’t been technically possible because of the exposure to UV, and also the plastics degrade and don’t recycle that well. What they’ve done here is make it technically viable, which is kind of the big thing,” says Morgan. That breakthrough – and its potential knock-on effects for recycling of challenging materials in general – is more significant than the origins of the waste plastic, says Morgan. “The bigger thing for me is the fact they’re using recycled plastic. Whether it’s from the oceans or not is kind of irrelevant.” “Once the technology is developed a bit more and economies of scale are made easier, it might become more mainstream,” he adds. Solutions to plastic waste Millions of tonnes of plastic are sent to landfill every year, and a large chunk of this ends up in the oceans: research suggests there could be more plastic than fish in the sea by 2050. Plastics production is expected to double in the next 20 years (pdf), but just 14% of plastic packaging is currently recycled globally, a figure that could be raised to 70% with concerted effort from industry, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Biodegradable plastic 'false solution' for ocean waste problem Read more Recycling may be a first step but if companies want to show real leadership they should shift to more circular economy business models, says Sophie Unwin, director of Scottish social enterprise Remade in Edinburgh. That means zero waste. “Innovations in product design are to be welcomed, but they mean little if the company is contributing to a trend of generating more waste overall,” says Unwin. Liz Goodwin, senior fellow and director of food loss and waste at the World Resources Institute, echoes this. While initiatives to remove plastics from the ocean are positive, she believes more needs to be done at an earlier stage: “In an ideal world we should be preventing waste plastic from going into the water in the first place and keeping waste plastic in use for as long as possible and recycling it.” This may require a more dramatic shift in approach – in the words of Ecover’s Van Gendt, “rethinking the bottle in general to something that’s much more closed loop”. Ecover, for example, is trying to encourage greater reuse with refillable cleaning products: “The most sustainable way to use a bottle is by refilling it multiple times,” she says. P&G has meanwhile pledged to boost its use of reycled content more broadly by using half a billion bottles made with 25% recycled plastic for European hair products by the end of 2018.

The initiative started in August 2016 with a viral video that showed the story of some girls and the challenges they faced. Girls between the ages 11 and 16 were invited to send in their essays about their dream careers and the challenges they face as girls. Of the over 2,000 entries received, 100 winners emerged. Speaking on the initiative, the Brand Marketing Director, Procter & Gamble Nigeria, Tolu Adedeji, said: “When the video was launched, we were overwhelmed with the response and support we received from everyone. It affirmed that starting up a conversation like the Always #MyFutureStartsToday could help build a girl’s confidence.” Following the competition, she said there would be a mentorship programme in partnership with the Women in Management, Business and Public Service (WIMBIZ), which will be organized for schools in Lagos and Abuja. She said girls in the schools would have the opportunity of being mentored, enlightened and inspired to achieve their potential. “There are so many challenges facing the girl child in Nigeria, as such, it is evident that girl education and mentorship will not only benefit the girls, it will also impact the whole society. The education of girls is important for us. In fact, Always advocates the empowerment of girls and women. In our bid to continue to contribute to Nigeria and Nigerian girls and women, we have launched this platform to reach more girls and help them to achieve their potential.” The Senior Brand Manager, P&G, Mokutima Ajileye, said: “The purpose for us is beyond just selling, rather it is to empower and advocate for girls and women. We have girls that tap into our category from age 11 and we do this globally in different ways depending on the market.” Ajileye explained that the brand wants to focus on education because once a girl-child is educated, other things would follow. “We know the struggles most girls face before being educated, like cultural barriers, which applies to the boys anyways. Hence, we decided to tackle financial barriers through essay contest among female students in secondary schools across the country for it to be based on merit.” Meanwhile, the founder of Bella Naija, Uche Pedro, who stressed the need for girls to reach their goals, said “we live in a world where girls are often told they cannot achieve certain feats simply because they are girls. That notion is wrong. I strongly believe that with confidence, a girl can achieve whatever she wants. This is why I joined Always in this campaign to help girls dream big and aspire towards their dreams.” The initiative was motivated by the result of a poll carried out by P&G, which revealed that 61 per cent of girls do not feel they have the right support to pursue their preferred career choice. It shows that girls face certain limitations when they decide to follow their dreams especially in developing societies. The organisation added that the MyFutureStartsToday campaign is working with women who have achieved success in their chosen careers, including Uche Pedro; Dr. Ola Orekunrin, the founder, Flying Doctors Nigeria; and Mercy Eghonghon, a professional Nigerian pilot who started flying at 17 and became a captain at 25.

Management Wants You to Know A closer look at the trends that convinced P&G to boost its full-year growth outlook. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Jan 23, 2017 at 6:54PM Image source: Getty Images. Last week, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) posted fiscal second-quarter earnings results that beat management's expectations. For the second straight quarter, sales growth was just ahead of projections even as profitability jumped higher. On their conference call with Wall Street analysts, executives went into detail about the challenges and opportunities P&G experienced over the past few months. Here are a few of the key points that Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller sought to get across to investors. Growth "Organic sales improved in five of six regions, 11 of the 15 largest markets, all five reporting segments, and in 9 of 10 product categories." P&G posted 2% overall organic sales growth, which marked a decline from the prior quarter's 3% jump. However, that figure was impressive for a few reasons. First, it showed building momentum in a few key geographies. Organic sales have now improved for three straight quarters in the U.S. and in China, P&G's second largest market. Second, the growth came despite economic challenges that the company did not anticipate, including currency disruptions in India and tough selling environments in Egypt, Turkey, and Argentina. Finally, the gains were volume driven, with volume rising a healthy 2% as pricing held steady. Portfolio payoff "We said the new portfolio would grow up to one [percentage] point faster and over the first two quarters of this fiscal year, we're seeing that play out." P&G finally has the portfolio that it has wanted for years, with the 66 brands it markets (down from 165) representing the fastest growing, most profitable franchises with the best long-term outlook for growth. CEO David Taylor and his team estimated last year that once the divestments are complete the new mix should produce one full percentage point higher organic growth. Shareholders should be encouraged by the early results showing that the brand-shedding process is finally starting to lift sales results. Profitability "Core gross margin was up 120 basis points, including 210 basis points of productivity improvement and a modest benefit from volume growth." Procter & Gamble is making significant improvements to its already market-beating profitability. The company cut nearly $10 billion out of its cost structure over the last five fiscal years and aims to remove another $10 billion through 2021. These shifts added three full percentage points to profitability, which was just partially offset by increased promotions. P&G operating margin is 21%, putting it ahead of nearly all its rivals, including Unilever and Kimberly-Clark. Cash returns "FY17 is a year of significant value return to shareholders. We expect to pay dividends of over $7 billion. We reduced outstanding shares by $9.4 billion in the transaction with Coty and we expect to purchase over $5 billion of our stock. " Investors were underwhelmed when P&G announced its smallest dividend raise in modern history last year, but the broader picture on cash returns tells a more positive story. Thanks to the funds it raised through selling off big brand franchises like Coty beauty products, the consumer goods giant is on pace to send $22 billion back to shareholders this year through a mix of stock repurchases and dividend payments. Investors should keep that in mind when judging the stock's performance. Sure, it has trailed the market by a wide margin over the last five years. But that gap disappears when you include dividends in the mix. PG data by YCharts Raising guidance "Despite some significant and unforeseen challenges, we stand at the halfway mark of our fiscal year, essentially on track with where we hoped we would be." Two quarters through the new fiscal year, P&G is optimistic about the business. In fact, executives raised their sales growth target to 2.5% from 2%, compared to the 1% uptick in 2016 and the flat result in the prior year. In part because of the economic challenges mentioned above, they left their earnings forecast unchanged. Still, the projected 5% profit uptick would be the first time in three fiscal years that P&G has hit its long-run earnings growth target.

Last Updated: 25 January 2017 Article by Paul Ranjard Wan Hui Da - Peksung IP Group Your LinkedIn Connections at Firm In 2014, the Supreme People's Court (SPC) circulated a draft and collected comments, after which the draft was significantly revised. This final version of the Provisions has been adopted at the 1703rd meeting of the Judicial Committee of the SPC on December 12, 2016 and will enter into effect on March 1, 2017. The Provisions brings very useful guidance for the Beijing IP Court (1st instance) and the Beijing High Court (2nd instance), in relation to appeals filed against decisions of the Trademark Review and Adjudication Board (TRAB). The 31 articles of these Provisions address a variety of situations, the main ones being related to "absolute grounds" of refusal, "relative grounds" of refusal, "bad faith" applications, other prior rights (copyright, name right etc.), the "use" of a trademark, and several procedural issues. The Provisions refers to the relevant articles of the Trademark Law (L. --- ) and to its own articles (Provisions --). Absolute grounds Prohibited signs (L.10) Regarding the use of State names (L. 10.1.1), the Provisions recommends to look at the trademark "as a whole". This means that even if a trademark contains the name of a State, if the mark is not, as a whole, similar to such name and if the registration of the mark would not be "detrimental to the national dignity", the mark may be registered (Provisions 3). The interpretation of the term "deceptive signs", in L. 10.1.7, may be made by reference to the same article of the 2001 version of the Trademark Law: "exaggeration and fraud in advertising". (Provisions 4). The expression "having other unhealthy influence" (L.10.1.8) refers to where the filing of a trademark has a "negative or adverse effect on China's public interests", which, for example, may be the result of the filing of the name of a public figure in the political, economic, cultural, religious, ethnic or other field" (Provisions 5). Geographical names (Chinese places above the County level or foreign places known to the public) are, in principle, prohibited under L.10.2. However, they may still be used if the sign, as a whole, has a meaning that allows distinction from the geographical name (Provisions 6). Distinctiveness (L.11) Signs that are the generic name of a product may not be registered as trademarks (L.11.1). However, the sign must be examined "as a whole". If the sign contains a descriptive element, while such element does not affect the distinctiveness of the sign, or if the descriptive sign is presented in a special manner so as to serve as a source identifier, the sign may be registered as a trademark (Provisions 7). In order to determine whether a sign is generic, the Court should verify if it is commonly perceived as such by the relevant public, and may refer to professional reference books, dictionaries etc. Such perception of the public may also be determined by reference to historical tradition, local customs and practices, geographical environment or other reasons. The Court should also consider the subjective knowledge of the applicant (who knows or should know that its trademark has become generic). Finally, the assessment should be made as of the time of filing of the application. However, if the situation has changed at the time of approval the court may base its decision on the time of registration. Where foreign language is used, it may happen that the foreign words have a descriptive inherent meaning, and should, in principle, be refused for registration as a trademark. However, if the relevant public is hardly aware of the meaning of such word, the mark may still function as a source identifier and be registered. (Provisions 8). Signs that are descriptive may not be registered as trademarks (L.11.2 ). This is the case for signs that merely or mainly describe the features etc. of the goods or services designated by the application. However, if the sign only insinuates the features of the goods... but does not affect its identifying function, the mark may be registered. 3D trademarks (L.12) The registration of such a sign remains very difficult. If, under most circumstances, the relevant public is not likely to take the sign as a source identifier, the mark may not be registered. Furthermore, the fact that the sign has been originally created by or firstly used by the applicant does not necessarily prove that it is distinctive. However, it is possible to rely on acquired distinctiveness through long term or extensive use (Provisions 9). Relative grounds Unregistered well-known trademark (L.13.2) The owner of an unregistered trademark may oppose or invalidate a litigious trademark by claiming that such trademark is a "duplication, imitation or translation" of its trademark, provided that the owner can prove that (1) its trademark, even though not registered in China, is well-known in China (L.13.2) and (2) that the registration of the litigious trademark is likely to cause confusion. For the determination of the likelihood of confusion, the Provisions enumerates the following factors to be considered by the Courts: The extent of similarity of the trademarks; The extent of similarity of the goods on which the trademarks are designated to be used; The extent of distinctiveness and reputation of the trademark that requests protection; The degree of attention of the relevant public; and Other pertinent factors. The Provisions make an additional comment to the above list: the "intention" of the applicant and the evidence of actual confusion may also be taken into consideration, but - and this has been specified by a judge of the SPC during a conference introducing the Provisions � the lack of evidence concerning the intentions of the applicant or any actual confusion will not have any negative impact. This article (Provisions 12) may be compared to the previous Opinions of the SPC, published in 2010 and 2011, where the SPC advised the Courts to take the reputation of both trademarks - the cited trademark and the litigious trademark � when assessing the similarity and the likelihood of confusion. This was called the "inclusive development theory". The theory seems to be abandoned. Registered well-known trademark (L.13.3) The Provisions, then, addresses the situation covered by L. 13.3: the owner of a registered well-known trademark opposes the application, or requests the invalidation, of an identical or similar trademark designating dissimilar goods or services (Provisions 13). Interestingly, however, the Provisions does not use the word dissimilar. It may be implied, though, but as we shall see when examining Provisions 14, this omission might be voluntary. The court is to examine whether the litigious trademark is likely to cause a certain degree of association, so as to mislead the public and harm the interests of the well-known trademark owner. Such examination is to be made by considering the following factors: The distinctiveness and extent of reputation of the Cited trademark; Whether the trademarks are sufficiently similar; The goods on which the trademarks are designated to be used; The extent of overlapping of the relevant public and the degree of attention thereof; Signs similar to the Cited trademark that are legitimately used by other market entities or other pertinent factors. Again, it may be noted that no reference is made to the reputation of the litigious trademark reputation, which confirms the abandonment of the "inclusive development theory". Provisions 25 introduces what appears to be the implementation of a ruling made by the SPC, on May 19, 2016, in the case P&G vs. TRAB and Weishida. In this case, P&G requested the invalidation of the Weishida trademark, more than five years after the registration date. Therefore, pursuant to article 41.2 (now renumbered 45.1) of the Trademark Law, P&G needed to prove that its trademark was well-known at the date of filing of the litigious trademark, and that the litigious trademark has been applied in bad faith. But another difficulty was to be overcome: the protection of a registered well-known trademark, as provided in the law (L.13), only applies to cases where the litigious trademark is used on dissimilar goods. In this case, the goods were identical. Yet, the SPC ruled that article 13 could apply even if the goods are identical. According to Provisions 14, if a party files an opposition of an invalidation action against a litigious trademark, claiming that its trademark is well-known, and the TRAB rules in favour of such claim on the basis of Article L.30 of the law (whereas such article concerns the protection of any trademark, even not well-known, against identical or similar trademarks designating identical or similar goods), the Court may apply Article L.30 if the trademark has been registered for less than 5 years, or apply Article L.13.3, if the trademark has been registered for more than five years. From this provision, it appears that the SPC agrees that a trademark owner may invoke Article 13.3 (in addition to article L.30) even when the litigious trademark is applied or registered for identical or similar goods. Indeed, if Article L.13.3 can be applied, after the 5 years, to a litigious trademark that would have been refused or invalidated pursuant to Article L.30 (within 5 years), it is obvious that the "dissimilar goods" condition is no longer required for the application of such Article 13.3. Unregistered trademark with a certain influence (L.32) If the opponent or invalidation applicant cannot prove that his trademark is well-known, it is still possible to successfully oppose, or invalidate, a trademark that has been applied or registered "preemptively by unfair means" (L.32). The owner of the cited trademark must prove that the trademark has been used in China and has acquired a certain influence, and must also address the "unfair means" issue. Here, the Provisions brings some assistance (Provisions 23): if the applicant of the litigious trademark definitely knew or should have known of the existence of the prior trademark, this may be presumed to constitute pre-emptive registration by unfair means, unless the applicant adduces evidence to prove that he has no bad faith in exploiting the reputation of the prior used trademark". So, provided sufficient of prior use is adduced, the SPC considers that the burden of proof should be reversed onto the litigious trademark applicant. Regarding the evidence proving a certain influence, the Provisions give examples such as continuous use for a certain period of time of a certain geographical coverage. And, to be perfectly clear, the Provisions adds that article L.32 only applies to trademarks filed on identical or similar goods or services. Other prior rights, copyright, name right etc. (L.32) If the prior right cited under L.32 is another civil right, such right must be valid not only before the date of the litigious trademark application but also at the time of the approval of the trademark (Provisions 18). Provisions 19 to 22 stipulate details explaining how to prove the ownership of copyright and the conditions for obtaining protection of the name, of a pseudonym, of a trade name, of a character image. Bad faith Provisions 15 and 16 provide details concerning the interpretation of L. 15.1 and L.15.2. For example, the terms agent or representative used in L.15.1 should be construed widely as including any kind of intermediary in the sense of sales agency, and should include persons having a kin or any specific relationship with such agent, and even if negotiation have taken place without being concluded. Likewise, the term "other relations" used in L.15.2 covers a wide range of circumstances (family relationship, labour relation, business location in the proximity, un-concluded negotiations). Finally, Provisions 25 deals with another aspect of article L.45.1 which is the "bad faith registration" of the litigious trademark. Here, the SPC introduces two new ideas. First, the Court should examine, not only, the intentions of the litigious trademark applicant (at the time of filing), but also, the status of use of the litigious trademark, which implies to consider facts that occurred after the date of filing. This is also the application of the abovementioned ruling on P&G vs. TRAB and Weishida. And secondly, where the reputation of the cited trademark is high, the Court may presume that the litigious trademark as filed in bad faith, unless the applicant can prove proper cause for such filing. This is the same reversal of the burden of proof as provided in Provisions 23. Use of a trademark (L.49.2) Provisions 26 clarifies the conditions for the revocation based on 3 year non-use, as stipulated in L.49.2. For example, if the used trademark has only a subtle difference with the registered trademark, this constitutes valid use. Showing the intent to use through necessary preparation may serve as a "proper reason" for the mark not to be (yet) in use. On the other hand, the mere fact of signing an assignment of license agreement, in the absence of actual use, is insufficient. Procedural issues Finally, the Provisions contain a few articles (Provisions 2 and Provisions 27 to 30) that address procedural technicalities. Provision 2 stipulates that, the court may, ex officio, raise a legal ground that a plaintiff had not raised in the administrative litigation, in order to rectify a decision that appears obviously inappropriate. Provision 28 clarifies a situation that occurs very frequently: (i) a trademark is refused on account of a prior right, (ii) the applicant files a review with the TRAB and at the same time a procedure against such prior right, but the procedure is still pending when the TRAB makes its ruling (which confirms the refusal). Then, the case is referred to the Court. The Provisions stipulate that, if the prior right obstacle has been removed ("new facts"), the Court may order the TRAB to re-make its decision (even though such decision was correct at the time).

CBS Television Even Chuckles the Clown is mourning this sad day. Actress Mary Tyler Moore – who starred in two iconic TV series, and produced many shows including “WKRP in Cincinnati” – died Wednesday at age 80. Ted Knight, Ed Asner and Mary Tyler Moore in 1977. Credit CBS Television Her break-though role was playing the wife on the “Dick Van Dyke Show” (1961-66) sponsored by Procter & Gamble the first season. In 1970, she turned our world on with a smile as unmarried career TV newswoman Mary Richards in the “Mary Tyler Moore Show” (1970-77), one of the greatest TV sitcoms ever. Moore surrounded herself with an excellent cast, including gruff Ed Asner (“You’ve got spunk. I hate spunk”), Ted Knight as the airhead anchorman and Betty White as the snarky “Happy Homemaker.” They were all there at the funeral for TV station co-worker “Chuckles the Clown” on Oct. 25, 1975, when Mary couldn’t stop laughing as the minister repeated Chuckles’ familiar phrase: “A little song, a little dance, a little seltzer down your pants.” The “Chuckles Bites The Dust” episode was ranked No. 1 on TV Guide’s “100 Greatest Episodes Of All Time” list in 1997. Moore and her husband Grant Tinker, later an NBC Entertainment executive, produced “Mary Tyler Moore” through their MTM Enterprises, along with “The Bob Newhart Show” (1972-1978), “Rhoda” (1974-1978), “Phyllis” (1975-1977), “The Tony Randall Show” (1976-1978), “Lou Grant” (1977-1982), “Betty White Show” (1977-1978), “WKRP” (1978-1982), “Hill Street Blues” (1981-1987), “St. Elsewhere” (1982-1988), “Newhart” (1982-1990)” and dozens of other shows.

Credit CBS Television Moore, who was diagnosed as a diabetic in her 30s, also was nominated for an Academy Award for her dramatic role in “Ordinary People” in 1981. Her film credits included “Six Weeks,” “Just Between Friends,” “Thoroughly Modern Millie” and “Change of Habit” with Elvis Presley. She also starred in several short-lived TV comebacks: “Mary,” ‘Annie McGuire,” “New York News” and the “Mary Tyler Moore Hour” variety show in 1979 -- with young sidekicks David Letterman and Michael Keaton. She knew how to turn the world on with a smile. Thanks for all the laughs. And Chuckles too.

After his historic debut as a 15-year-old in 1944, Nuxhall returned to the Reds in 1952 at age 23. He won 83 games for in the club in the 1950s – going 12-5 in 1954 and 17-12 in 1955. He led the National League with 5 shutouts in 1955, and made the All-Star teams in 1955 and 1956. Then he fell apart in 1960 with a 1-8 record and 4.42 ERA at age 32. Enjoy 'Dick Van Dyke Show' Sunday, Which P&G Almost Killed By John Kiesewetter • Dec 8, 2016 CBS Television If Procter & Gamble had its way, the "Dick Van Dyke Show" being celebrated by CBS in prime-time Sunday would never have aired. P&G, the sponsor for the first "Dick Van Dyke" season (1961-62), pulled the plug on advertising  a second season of the Dick Van Dyke-Mary Tyler Moore comedy after it finished No. 80.

By Alan Tovey 6:27 AM Thursday Jan 26, 2017 SHARE: Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Not saved Email Print Markets United States Sponsor message.   Video will play in Play now Don't auto play Never auto play What's happening? The Dow Jones Industrial average has hit the psychologically important 20,000 mark, having repeatedly tested this level in the run-up to Christmas and consistently hit record highs. What is the Dow Jones? It's a price-weighted index of 30 of the largest and/or most important publicly traded companies in the US. Invented by Charles Dow in 1896, it acts as a proxy for the wider health of the US economy. What's so important about the 20,000 level? In many ways, nothing - it's just a number that relates to performance. However, to humans trading shares, rather than computer algorithms, it represents a significant marker. It's a "resistance level" that can be difficult to break through for human dealers who often trade on fears.But we've got here. How? Myriad factors. 1. President Trump Perhaps the most important one is President Donald Trump. There was a degree of nervousness ahead of the US election but once the bombshell result had been digested, investors decided that Trump would be good for business, and particularly some of the companies that are Dow members. 2. Industry's likely to be stronger Continued below. Related Content Donald Trump's White House press secretary Sean Spicer: 'One way or another Mexico will pay for wall' China touted as TPP partner after US move Video Watch: Dow Jones industrial average crosses 20,000 Trump has pledged to strengthen US manufacturing and bring work home, bolstering companies such as Caterpillar, which is up more than a third in the year to date, and United Technologies, 15 per cent stronger. Other big winners are 3M and IBM, both about a fifth more valuable. Nasdaq Tower in New York's Times Square, as the display shows that the Dow Jones industrial average crossed the 20,000 mark for the first time. Photo / AP Trump's tweeted threats about the repercussions for US companies which elected to offshore work caused some consternation, but did have the effect of least encouraging some high-profile names to bring work home or invest in domestic production facilities. Companies with big manufacturing operations such as Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble have also soared, as their prospects are closely linked to economic growth. There's also been the promise to rebuild the US's worn-down infrastructure, which will generate jobs and in turn boost economic growth domestically. Today, Trump is expected to sign legislation promising to build his controversial wall on the US-Mexico border, a massive infrastructure project which will deliver a huge lift to construction and building materials businesses. 3. A shot in the arm for pharma businesses Drug companies also surged immediately after the election, on the belief that Trump would support a free market in healthcare and a potential roll-back of the controversial Obamacare, though the president-elect has since tempered this enthusiasm, saying: "I'm going to bring down drug prices... I don't like what's happened to drug prices." Still, companies in the sector such as United Health and Merck have risen by almost 40 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. 4. Banks are in the money The real stock market darlings are in the banking sector, which has surged on the prospect of lighter regulation. As the Dow neared the 20,000 mark just before Christmas, analysts calculated that investment in Goldman Sachs, up 34 per cent in the year to date, was responsible for 419 points of the index's rise since the start of the year. Rival JP Morgan wasn't far behind, with its shares rising a hair less than 30 per cent in the year to date. Higher interest rates - Fed chair Janet Yellen has already hiked once and signalled two or three more rises to come - have also helped, as banks perform better when rates are higher as they can charge more for loans. Specialist Frank Masiello wears a Dow 20,000 cap as he works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Photo / AP 5. Oiling the wheels Trump's Cabinet appointments also send a loud signal that his administration could be good for big business. Most notable is ExxonMobil boss Rex Tillerson as secretary of state - it's no wonder that Dow constituent Exxon is a major gainer over the year, rising 16pc, though this is far behind Chevron, which is up more than 30 per cent. 6. A cabinet of billionaires Other big business names will be joining Trump in the White House. Investor and former banker Wilbur Ross - who has an estimated fortune of US$2.5 billion - is slated to be secretary of commerce. The nomination for army secretary is Vinnie Viola, the founder of trading firm Virtu Financial; he's estimated to be worth US$1.8b. Other leading business figures in Trump's cabinet include a former Goldman COO. There's a lot of bad things going on, though - why is the Dow rising? Despite terrorist attacks, markets have proven surprisingly resilient, shrugging off fears. It seems that there's a newfound confidence in the air. Anything else driving this? Well, there's the traditional Santa rally that took place before Christmas which set up the Dow to get to the 20,000 mark. As the year ends, shares tend to rise. There are many theories about what drives it, from dealers clearing up trades for the end of the year, people investing bonuses, and just general seasonal good cheer driving stocks higher. Whatever the reason, it held true at the end of 2016, and set up the Dow for a winning start to 2017. - Daily Telegraph UK By Alan Tovey Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Toolkit 2017 explores the issues raised by Procter & Gamble's decision last year to cut back on targeted advertising on Facebook. (Non-subscribers can download a sample of this Toolkit chapter here.) Global Brand Building Officer, Marc Pritchard, revealed that its Tide detergent brand had increased media reach by 10% to 20% in the US by shifting to more broadly appealing television shows and higher-reach digital platforms. But reaching the masses and targeting with precision do not have to be mutually exclusive events, according to Julie Coleman, Manager, Deloitte Digital, who suggests three things for marketers to consider. First, does the brand have well defined customer journeys, with carefully sequenced messaging throughout? It might use TV for premium-impact messaging at scale, then follow this up with a digital campaign, supporting awareness over a longer period of time and broadening the audience, or using pockets of targeting to make the message bespoke to relevant high value or impact groups. Second, with so much focus on 'audience', a brand should ensure it is not overlooking the value of 'context' – there may be higher value to a campaign if an ad can be shown in a premium context where the user is dwelling longer on the page. Third, a brand should consider how it might combine mass reach and precision targeting to move beyond brand recognition into positive brand sentiment, as Coca-Cola has done by putting names on bottles. The Toolkit also observes that as budgets shift towards digital, brands are increasingly adopting a short-term outlook, in part simply because short-term metrics are common in the digital space. Marketing consultant Peter Field has conducted research in this area and concluded: "The inevitable result of short-term measurement is a drift to strategies that deliver better in the short term. These deliver poorer long-term performance and so short-termism ultimately undermines long-term effectiveness." Field's work with Les Binet further suggests that, while the optimum ratio of brand-building to activation work is 60:40, in recent years advertisers have begun to spend considerably more than 40% of their budgets on activation.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Jan 24, 2017 at 6:25PM Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) posted fourth-quarter results on Tuesday that met executives' low sales growth expectations while modestly outperforming on the bottom line. The owner of Kleenex and Huggies consumer brands also paired a weak forecast for the 2017 fiscal year with a solid boost to its quarterly dividend. Here's how the big-picture results stacked up against the prior-year period.  Metric Q4 2016 Actuals Q4 2015 Actuals Growth (YOY) Revenue $4.5 billion $4.5 billion N/A Net income $505 million $333 billion 52% EPS $1.40 $0.91 54% Data source: Kimberly-Clark financial filings. Weak sales, steady profits Organic sales growth clocked in at 1%, which was a slight improvement over the prior quarter's flat result. The gains were split evenly between developing and emerging markets and were driven by modest volume growth. The revenue figure met management's forecast, but only after the team had lowered its outlook in the prior two successive quarters. Kimberly-Clark began the year targeting 5% organic growth to match 2015's result but finished with just a 2% increase. Rival Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) outpaced Kimberly-Clark for the second straight quarter by announcing a 2% gain last week. Image source: Kimberly-Clark. Kimberly-Clark's bottom line benefited from aggressive cost-cutting that pushed gross profit up 3% to $1.7 billion despite the flat revenue figure. The company also reduced overall expenses by 4% so that adjusted earnings rose by a healthy 5%. The 50% spike in reported profit came from an unusually low earnings result in a prior-year period that included major restructuring charges. Management's focus Executives were pleased that Kimberly-Clark could defend its brands despite a weakening consumer products industry and increased pricing pressure from rivals. "While we experienced a challenging economic and competitive environment," CEO Thomas Falk said in a press release, "our market share positions remained broadly healthy." "We also achieved record cost savings, which helped us improve our margins and deliver earnings in line with our guidance for the year," Falk continued. "We generated strong cash flow and returned $2.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases." Looking ahead Management isn't optimistic about the coming year. Whereas Procter & Gamble raised its sales outlook to 2.5% (which would be its highest result on that metric in three years), Kimberly-Clark sees little chance of quickly bouncing back toward 2015's 5% growth pace. Instead, the company forecast another year of weak gains. Executives see organic growth averaging 2% in 2017. "We will execute our global business plan strategies in what we expect will be a continued difficult environment," Falk explained. The business plan might not deliver market-beating sales growth, but investors can still expect to see plenty of improvements on finances as costs trend lower and as Kimberly-Clark wrings more efficiency out of its global infrastructure. After all, operating cash flow jumped 40% over the last 12 months to over $3 billion. More success there should help protect earnings growth while providing funds for steady cash returns to shareholders. The past year's $2.1 billion of capital return spending matched 2015's result despite a 2% drop in reported revenue. Kimberly-Clark expects to direct roughly $1 billion toward capital improvements this year while spending the same amount on stock repurchases. Its dividend payment will rise by 5.4%, giving it a rare win against P&G, which most recently disappointed income investors with just a 1% boost to its quarterly payout.

There, they found 49-year-old Fabio Sementilli on the outdoor patio of the home. He had suffered numerous stab wounds and was pronounced dead at the scene, according to a release from the LAPD. Detectives say that Sementilli had been stabbed several times in the torso and neck, while the L.A. Times reports that he had also suffered wounds to his face. Investigators also learned that his car—a black 2008 Porsche Carrera 911 with paper plates—was missing. Sementilli was a hairdresser who had worked with companies including Proctor & Gamble and Wella, a haircare company with headquarters in Woodland Hills. According to Modern Salon, Sementilli was born in Canada had "mentored tens of thousands of hairdressers with a hands-on approach either on a one-to-one basis or on a grander scale." He once appeared in an episode of the Canadian talk show Steven and Chris, and in the below video via American Salon Stories. "I think about this a lot. [I] sit in the backyard... and I say to myself what do I want to be remembered for?" he says in the clip below. "I always say to myself, I want to be remembered for the relationships I built. I want to be remembered for how... I've made people feel in a positive light and if it was negative for any reason, it's because i was honest." Authorities believe there may be two suspects in the case and will review surveillance footage, according to CBS Los Angeles. Anyone with information should contact LAPD Detective Steve Castro at 818-374-1925, or 1-877-527-3247 during non-business hours or on weekends.

"If you have any doubts that protectionism is the message, you clearly didn't watch Trump's talk to a whole bunch of CEOs about the need to buy American and hire American or face the consequences of major taxes," the "Mad Money" host said. The one area investors can turn to right now are stocks in the Trump-free zone, Cramer said. Those are companies that do not need Trump, aren't on his bad side and can do well when the economy slows. Trump-free stocks include FANG, Cramer's acronym for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, and now Alphabet. Semiconductor companies such as Skyworks Solutions and semiconductor equipment stocks like Nvidia and Lam Research also work. The last group were the cloud plays, like Adobe and Salesforce. Ultimately, Cramer reminded investors to take Trump for his word and suggested that Trump-free stocks like technology or domestic stocks like Comcast could work in a portfolio. Adam Jeffery | CNBC Marc Benioff, CEO of SalesForce. Last month, Procter & Gamble was downgraded to a "sell" by two different firms, as the company is believed to be front in center in a host of challenges that will hit the market in 2017: The strong dollar, political turmoil, online disintermediation and scrutiny for its use of inorganic materials and preciously wasteful manufacturing processes. With this many difficulties, Cramer was surprised when the company guided up to 2 to 3 percent organic growth from 2 percent, which implied that market share gains and innovation were strong. Additionally, on its conference call, Procter management responded to all of these issues. "The total sum of the call was nothing short of a stinging rebuke to those who sold this stock to buy an industrial or go into cash to flee a feared Trump-led stock market Armageddon," Cramer said. Looking back at the dismal retail holiday numbers, Cramer boiled it all down to the erosion of Target. The problem wasn't Macy's, it wasn't Kohl's or even J.C. Penney. It was Target. "It is doing the best online of all the brick-and-mortar retailers. And this ugly quarter is what ultimately happens. That is a pretty grim fate for the group," he said. Target found itself in one of the worst possible situations, Cramer said. Its online offerings were so good it was stealing traffic from its own bricks-and-mortar stores. The self-cannibalization of Target was the sorriest event of the entire retail debacle this holiday season. Getty Images A Target store is seen in Miami. Skyworks Solutions has made a comeback in 2017, with shares up 20 percent since the beginning of the year. The stock skyrocketed 13 percent in a single session on Friday after reporting a strong quarter. Skyworks is a semiconductor company that makes chips that go into various technologies, including smartphones, GPS, wireless networking, medical applications and cars. Many investors associate it as the maker of power amplifiers for the iPhone. Cramer spoke with Skyworks' CEO Liam Griffin, who outlined some of the reasons why he is bullish on the future of the company. "Smartphones will continue to be a very important part of our strategic landscape but in parallel, we have this IOT dynamic, this internet of things where the connection that brings these things to the internet is vital to Skyworks. That is a billion unit opportunity and growing over the next five to 10 years," Griffin said. Frits van Paasschen has had a storied career as a seasoned business executive, including going head-to-head at the negotiating table with Donald Trump. "The key is to separate his antics from his actions and focus on what he is going to try to do, and what he wants to get," van Paasschen said. Van Paasschen is the former CEO of Starwood Hotels and Resorts and Coors Brewing Company. When he was running Starwood, he had the chance to see the results of disruptive innovation around the globe, which prompted him to write a new book entitled "The Disruptors' Feast". "My style isn't his [Trump's], but what he does is he makes it very clear what he is trying to get out of the negotiation," van Paasschen said. In the Lightning Round, Cramer quickly gave his opinion on stocks from callers: Xilinx, Inc: "I think Xilinx could be owned on earnings. Very rare. T-Mobile I feel the same way. Earnings or takeover. That's right, I think you could own it either way because I think it can be bought and it can be bought on earnings." Fitbit: "I expect nothing good to come of Fitbit. It turned out to be a commodity that's all it really was. It's a shame because it had such a great concept. But there is just too many of them. It's an overcrowded category. I can't recommend it."

A tissue of truths Printed human body parts could soon be available for transplant How to build organs from scratch Jan 28th 2017 Add this article to your reading list by clicking this button Tweet Aye, aye! What’s this ear? EVERY year about 120,000 organs, mostly kidneys, are transplanted from one human being to another. Sometimes the donor is a living volunteer. Usually, though, he or she is the victim of an accident, stroke, heart attack or similar sudden event that has terminated the life of an otherwise healthy individual. But a lack of suitable donors, particularly as cars get safer and first-aid becomes more effective, means the supply of such organs is limited. Many people therefore die waiting for a transplant. That has led researchers to study the question of how to build organs from scratch. One promising approach is to print them. Lots of things are made these days by three-dimensional printing, and there seems no reason why body parts should not be among them. As yet, such “bioprinting” remains largely experimental. But bioprinted tissue is already being sold for drug testing, and the first transplantable tissues are expected to be ready for use in a few years’ time. In this section Searching for particles on a benchtop Mediocre academic researchers should be wary of globalisation A computer program that learns how to save fuel Printed human body parts could soon be available for transplant Reprints Related topics Technology Biotechnology Science and technology Just press “print” Bioprinting originated in the early 2000s, when it was discovered that living cells could be sprayed through the nozzles of inkjet printers without damaging them. Today, using multiple print heads to squirt out different cell types, along with polymers that help keep the structure in shape, it is possible to deposit layer upon layer of cells that will bind together and grow into living, functional tissue. Researchers in various places are tinkering with kidney and liver tissue, skin, bones and cartilage, as well as the networks of blood vessels needed to keep body parts alive. They have implanted printed ears, bones and muscles into animals, and watched these integrate properly with their hosts. Last year a group at Northwestern University, in Chicago, even printed working prosthetic ovaries for mice. The recipients were able to conceive and give birth with the aid of these artificial organs. No one is yet talking of printing gonads for people. But blood vessels are a different matter. Sichuan Revotek, a biotechnology company based in Chengdu, China, has successfully implanted a printed section of artery into a monkey. This is the first step in trials of a technique intended for use in humans. Similarly, Organovo, a firm in San Diego, announced in December that it had transplanted printed human-liver tissue into mice, and that this tissue had survived and worked. Organovo hopes, within three to five years, to develop this procedure into a treatment for chronic liver failure and for inborn errors of metabolism in young children. The market for such treatments in America alone, the firm estimates, is worth more than $3bn a year. Johnson & Johnson, a large American health-care company, is so convinced that bioprinting will transform parts of medical practice that it has formed several alliances with interested academics and biotechnology firms. One of these alliances, with Tissue Regeneration Systems, a firm in Michigan, is intended to develop implants for the treatment of defects in broken bones. Another, with Aspect, a biotechnology company in Canada, is trying to work out how to print parts of the human knee known as the meniscuses. These are crescent-shaped cartilage pads that separate the femur from the tibia, and act as shock absorbers between these two bones—a role that causes huge wear and tear, which sometimes requires surgical intervention. More immediately, bioprinting can help with the development and testing of other sorts of treatments. Organovo already offers kidney and liver tissue for screening potential drugs for efficacy and safety. If this takes off it will please animal-rights activists, as it should cut down on the number of animal trials. It will please drug companies, too, since the tissue being tested is human, so the results obtained should be more reliable than ones from tests on other species. With similar motives in mind, L’Oréal, a French cosmetics firm, Procter & Gamble, an American consumer-goods company, and BASF, a German chemical concern, are working on printing human skin. They propose to use it to test their products for adverse reactions. L’Oréal already grows about five square metres of skin a year using older and slower technology. Bioprinting will permit it to grow much more, and also allow different skin types and textures to be printed. Skin in the game Printed skin might eventually be employed for grafts—repairing burns and ulcers. Plans are also afoot, as it were, to print skin directly onto the surface of the body. Renovacare, a firm in Pennsylvania, has developed a gun that will spray skin stem cells directly onto the wounds of burns victims. (Stem cells are cells that proliferate to produce all of the cell types that a tissue is composed of.) The suggestion is that the stem cells in question will come from the patient himself, meaning that there is no risk of his immune system rejecting the new tissue. The real prize of all this effort would be to be able to print entire organs. For kidneys, Roots Analysis, a medical-technology consultancy, reckons that should be possible in about six years’ time. Livers, which have a natural tendency to regenerate anyway, should also arrive reasonably soon. Hearts, with their complex internal geometries, will take longer. In all cases, though, printed organs would mean that those awaiting transplants have to wait neither for the altruism of another nor the death of a stranger to provide the means to save their own lives.

As of this point in earning season, 15 Dow members have reported earnings. Of the 15, Cramer found at least 13 with numbers that indicate the rally is the real deal. "This move is not alchemy, it is not animal spirits. It is the earnings, which is the best reason to rally," the "Mad Money" host said. Getty Images McDonald's worker prepares french fries to go. No. 1 was American Express, which went down after reporting earnings. Cramer thinks this is a big mistake, and expects it to head back to the $90s. No. 2 was Boeing, whose results impressed Cramer, especially with its profitable Dreamliner. No. 3, DuPont, reported a very strong quarter, leaving Cramer simply amazed. He attributed the success to CEO Ed Breen, who is in the process of merging with Dow Chemical. No. 4, General Electric, missed out big time, Cramer said. He was disappointed with the execution and confused by moves made with oil and gas, along with its shortfall in the turbine business. "Don't look for GE for help now that we have broken out above Dow 20,000," Cramer said. Goldman Sachs checked in at number 5, and is in a great position to benefit from deregulation and rate hikes. The last quarter was reported before these elements were even implemented, so Cramer could only salivate over what it could deliver once the backdrop improves. IBM was sixth, and traded down initially on its conference call—making Cramer convinced sellers were insane. Forty percent of IBM's business is growing like a young startup. He thinks it's time to pay more, not less for the stock, and said it could go to $200. No. 7, Johnson and Johnson, did not have a weak quarter, despite what naysayers believe, Cramer said. In a world that is less reliant on Donald Trump and less cyclical, he said it is a buy. JPMorgan, which just delivered the best quarter it has ever reported, was number 8. On virtually every metric, the company simply has no peer, Cramer said. Yet the stock is still cheap at only 13 times earnings. No. 9 was McDonald's, making Cramer feel lonely for liking the stock on the conference call. He said the stock is just fine, and doesn't agree that the company is done reinventing itself. No. 10, 3M, is so innovative, Cramer wouldn't be surprised to see if it led the way higher from here as consumers snap back. Procter & Gamble, at number 11, was ready when the dollar strengthened and had a large boost from earnings, large gains in market share and restructuring that is paying off. If the stock comes down, Cramer said it will be bought. No. 12, Travelers, just delivered a clean beat when it earned $3.20 a share when Wall Street was only looking for $2.81. "Look for this insurance company's investment portfolio to give you some real vig this year as rates go higher on risk-free securities. Travelers hates risk," Cramer said. At number 13, UnitedHealth has a pattern of blowing away numbers, followed by the stock falling into a funk as investors assess the quarter. Cramer believes that this stock is on the right side of President Donald Trump, because of its criticism of Obamacare. No. 14 was United Technologies, which delivered again. The numbers were so superb, investors didn't notice the couple of pennies per share Trump knocked off the company's earnings by keeping jobs in Indiana. Verizon, which logged in at number 15, was terrible, Cramer said. It was losing share all over the place, and was by far the worst in show. "If the numbers from the other 15 Dow stocks are even close to this good, we could have a lot more room to run," Cramer said. Questions for Cramer?

MENU All Girls Fantasy Sports Advice Real sports As seen on tv Rankings Everything else Shop Home Animals Current Page Snickers Will Air The First-Ever Live Super Bowl Ad, Starring Kylo Ren Tweet Rick Chandler 2:55 pm, January 25th, 2017 And here we go — it’s time for the Super Bowl commercials to start rolling in. These days you don’t have to wait for the big game, because where’s the profit in that? For $5 million per 30-second spot, companies need to get all the publicity they can from these commercials, so releasing them pre-game is the way to go. As the new spots come out, we’ll be keeping you up to date right here, and when we get enough we’ll rank ’em. Check back every day until Feb. 5. UPDATES: * GoDaddy has a teaser trailer: cats on Roombas! * Mr. Clean is in every room of the house and he is watching you. * Snickers will air the first-ever live Super Bowl commercial. * Heinz is sitting out Super Bowl LI, but its presence will be felt. The Full Ads Skittles checks in with their new ad, and it’s an upgrade from last year’s bizarre Steven Tyler nightmare-inducer. “Katy! …” TurboTax is back for the fourth consecutive year with a 45-second spot, starring Humpty Dumpty. Wix would like to remind you that it’s easy to make your own stunning web site. Although what that has to do with busting up a restaurant is unclear. Intel apparently thinks that people will watch Tom Brady do anything — even brush his teeth before eating a pancake off of the floor. After taking it away from a dog. I would have re-thought this one. Teaser Trailers We don’t know exactly how this is going to work, but Snickers‘ 30-second spot will be live to lead off the third quarter of the game. It will feature Adam Driver (Kylo Ren in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and be preceded by a 36-hour livestream, at SnickersLive.com (noon ET on Thursday, Feb. 2, until midnight Friday night. Here are four teasers, combined for your convenience. None of it makes any sense so far. GoDaddy is under new management (a new ad agency), and is back after skipping Super Bowl 50. According to AdAge, the ad will go like this: “In GoDaddy’s commercial, we will be introduced to the ‘Internet,’ who is covered in tattoos of web references, like Wi-Fi symbols, memes and floppy discs. The 30-second game day spot will include a look inside the house of the ‘Internet’ and will feature a song made popular by the internet. While most of the references included in the commercial will be recognizable to a broad audience, there will be some more obscure references hidden throughout.” Proctor & Gamble makes its Super Bowl debut, boasting that Mr. Clean is “the official cleaner of Super Bowl LI”. But this is a very different Mr. Clean … apparently he wants to sex you up, in every room of the house. Avocados From Mexico is back, and the ad — to be shown during the first commercial break of the game — will focus on the avocado being a health food. Since more avocados are consumed during the Super Bowl than during any other time of the year, it’s surprising that AFM have only been in the past three big games. Here’s the teaser trailer, featuring Jon Lovitz: Kia is going to make you wait awhile to see what’s chasing Melissa McCarthy. PepsiCo will be touting its line of bottle water products, Lifewtr, with its Inspiration Drops spot. Featured will be a songby John Legend. Not participating this year Butterfinger, Doritos, Mini USA, SunTrust, Taco Bell, Toyota, Visa. Heinz, which gave us the entertaining Weiner Stampede during last year’s game, is also not returning to the Super Bowl. But they saved a few mil by running an ad right after the game, and releasing an extended version online (which may be the wave of the future).

To support Ad Age and the industry we cover please either: SUBSCRIBE or WHITELIST US Lowdown: First Reviews Are in on Bud Light's New Campaign Published on January 25, 2017. The Lowdown is Ad Age's weekly look at news nuggets from across the world of marketing, including trends, campaign tidbits, executive comings and goings and more. When the nation's largest beer brand changes its ad campaign, it's a big deal -- especially when the brand is in need of a comeback. So it's not surprising that the first spot from Bud Light's new "Famous Among Friends" campaign is already generating a range of reactions. Beer Business Daily Editor Harry Schuhmacher -- who is not afraid to call it as he sees it -- gushed on Monday to his readers that "it's the best work out of Bud Light since Bob Lachky handed over the reins of the Clydesdales," referring to the highly respected former chief creative officer who left the brewer in 2009. On Tuesday he followed up with anonymous feedback from a reader (the publication caters to beer wholesalers) who praised the ad for "calling itself out for being a sappy … bromance which is exactly the narrative we could all use these divisive days." One beer distributor told Ad Age that the campaign "is much better than the last two campaigns, which were terrible," referring to last year's politically themed "Bud Light Party" effort and 2014/2015's "The Perfect Beer for Whatever Happens" effort. But the distributor added: "I believe it has potential but am concerned it is generic. I'm not sure a brand can own friendship any more than it can own refreshment. I'm looking forward to seeing the spot they will show on the Super Bowl. I'm hopeful it will be indicative of a campaign that can build brand image and sell boxes." MillerCoors, meanwhile, seized on the similarities it says the new Bud Light ad shares with their old "Miller Time" campaign for Miller Lite, which debuted in 2012 with the resurrected classic tagline. Ads tried to portray Lite as the beer good friends drink when they get together. This old Lite ad below shares some of the same traits as the new Bud Light spot. (MillerCoors has since moved on to a new campaign that plays up Lite's liquid and heritage credentials.) In a statement to Ad Age, MillerCoors Chief Marketing Officer David Kroll said: "In 2012, we unsuccessfully aired similar work for Miller Lite called 'Brewed for Brotherhood' that failed on many levels. Our campaign said nothing about the beer, it dramatized cliché beer 'bro' bonding and drinkers found the spots confusing as the execution was dependent on audio for storytelling. It's work we've moved away from for good reason: We are excited to build purpose-led brands and let drinkers know more about the quality of our beer. While it's tough to predict the success of a campaign on one execution, we have been down this road before and would be surprised if the results were different." Anheuser-Busch InBev declined to respond. Mr. Kroll's comments reflect a newly aggressive approach MillerCoors is taking against its rival, including criticizing Bud Light in advertising. Now, onto some less confrontational tidbits -- like free stuff from the world's largest fast food marketer… McDonald's gives away Big Mac Special Sauce for the first time in the U.S. Credit: McDonald's McDonald's is giving away 10,000 bottles of its Big Mac special sauce this week. The giveaway happens at restaurants on Jan. 26. Some media outlets, including Ad Age, got their chilled bottles early. The giveaway ties into this month's nationwide introduction of the smaller Mac Jr. and larger Grand Mac burgers, set to be in restaurants through March 20, while supplies last. McDonald's has given out Big Mac special sauce in other countries before, but said this is the first bottle giveaway at home. And while 10,000 might sound like a lot, there aren't even enough for each of its 14,000 or so U.S. restaurants. Meanwhile, other restaurants are upping their marketing games with, well, games. Chipotle Credit: Chipotle Mexican Grill Chipotle Mexican Grill this week introduced an online game called "Cado Crusher" in partnership with Super Bowl advertiser Avocados From Mexico. In the online game, players smash and blend ingredients to make guacamole. The payoff? A mobile offer for a free order of chips and guacamole at Chipotle, with the purchase of an entree. "This game provides a fun way for our customers to see the short list of quality ingredients that go into each and every batch of our scratch-made guacamole," Mark Crumpacker, chief marketing and development officer at Chipotle, said in a statement. Chipotle said to make its guacamole, each of its restaurants goes through about five cases of avocados a day. Yahoo and Pizza Hut's Squares Pick'em Credit: Yahoo For Avocados From Mexico, the game is a chance to generate a little more buzz before its third consecutive appearance with a Super Bowl spot. This week's other restaurant game partnership announcement comes from Pizza Hut and Yahoo Fantasy Sports. They have teamed up for Squares Pick'em, a tech-savvy version of the squares betting boxes people often fill out for the Super Bowl. Just like real life, the numbers won't be displayed until squares are chosen. The game works similarly to Yahoo's other fantasy sports programs. Users invite friends to pick boxes on a 10x10 grid and set up their own leagues. Super Bowl Sunday is Pizza Hut's busiest day of the year. "The entire sports-viewing occasion has changed, with digital engagement being as much a part of it as the game itself, which is why we're excited to be part of the launch for this new digital game from Yahoo Sports," David Daniels, VP-advertising & media at Pizza Hut, said in a statement. Pizza Hut will be featured in display, search and email ads, while Yahoo will promote the program through blogs and NFL stories, Yahoo said. Procter & Gamble Co. already has some cleaning brands advertising in the game -- Mr. Clean and Febreze -- but it's also spending a bit more to improve your bathroom experience during the Super Bowl. While people put plenty of thought and money into buying booze and snacks for the game, P&G believes they aren't spending enough time thinking about the bathroom. That's a shame, because P&G says that more U.S. toilets are flushed during halftime of the Super Bowl than any other time of the year, yet 62% of people say they're likely to forget buying bathroom supplies for the comfort of their party guests. To remedy that, Citizen Relations has launched a publicity and social-media effort around the #HalftimeBathroomBreak for Febreze and Charmin, the latter of which isn't buying an ad, but is the official toilet paper of the NFL and hitching a promotional ride with its sibling. To back the effort, Citizen has sent out what may be the first press kit ever to include a golden (painted) toilet seat, along with a roll of Charmin, Febreze products, and a Charmin-Febreze bobble head, among other things. It's still not butter. But Unilever's I Can't Believe It's Not Butter has stopped dwelling so much on that, at least in the U.K. The brand has changed its name there to "I Can't Believe It's So Good … for Everything." This name change is not coming to the U.S., where the brand has its roots and a bigger business, a Unilever spokeswoman said. As for the reason it's doing this in the U.K., a Unilever brand manager told the Sun newspaper that it's about highlighting the spread's versatility for cooking. It's apparently not about shifting focus from not being butter, given that butter has been eroding sales of margarine for years. Switch Fresh deodorant from Dwyane Wade's cousin Antoine Wade has refillable packaging. Credit: Switch Fresh NBA star Dwyane Wade has been a pitchman for Unilever's Dove Men+Care, but now his cousin Antoine Wade is leaning on his support to launch a rival deodorant product with a unique twist -- refillable containers. Switch Fresh, which uses replaceable deodorant cartridges, is an "eco-friendly" design that's an alternative to what the brand says are the 800 deodorant packages an average person will throw away in a lifetime. The product was born from a brainstorming session with Dwyane, said Antoine, in a statement. For now, Unilever and other titans of deodorant probably have nothing to fear, as Switch Fresh is just starting out with an Indiegogo fundraising effort -- albeit backed by some cool product shots. Shiseido Americas, the Japanese cosmetics company's U.S. subsidiary, has acquired Matchco, which produces mass-customized makeup. The patented technology lets consumers scan their skin tones through a mobile app, then uses the data collected to individually blend a matching, custom foundation for each person. The app was a winner of Apple's "Best New App" and "Best of November" awards at launch in 2015. The idea is to use the technology across the company's cosmetics portfolio. The Matchco team will remain in California, where it will also pitch in with product development and consumer insights for Shiseido. European Wax Center Credit: European Wax Center European Wax Center is baring all with a new campaign, its first from Pereira & O'Dell New York, which won the Aventura, Fla.-based salon's business last year. The "Revealing You" campaign includes TV, radio, print and out-of-home, with photography from Miles Aldridge. The 13-year-old chain, which has over 628 locations, spent $5.4 million on measured media in 2015, according to Kantar Media. Contributing: E.J.

This marks the beginning of a 3-year journey among global business and brand leaders who are working together to create a new collective and locally relevant vision of what the ‘Good Life’ means for a healthy individual, family, community, city, country and planet. The initiative is designed to build a productive partnership between brands and consumers to help shift the world toward a healthier economy and a sustainably flourishing future. SB’17 Detroit will gather nearly 2,500 brand leaders, sustainability professionals and design innovators as well as the ecosystem of NGO’s, entrepreneurs, service providers and others who must collaborate to drive shift in economic norms.  Participants will convene at the Cobo Center in downtown Detroit, MI to spark a critical and timely conversation about what the Good Life entails and how to translate this into new business opportunity for brands to respond. The event will highlight the ideas and companies who are redefining new global societal aspirations that point toward a sustainable future.  More than 300 acclaimed leaders across multiple industries are expected to pose thought provoking questions and provide examples as part of the formal conference program of what really defines a Good Life for humans around the globe today. Presentations and formal structured sessions will serve as a precursor to a new format of facilitated co-creative dialogue that will travel around the world.  It will have the goal of capturing and reporting out consumer insights and ideas for design principles that brands can tap for delivering better product and services offerings to market in the coming decades.  Experts and thought leaders include: Daniel Lubetzky, CEO of KIND Snacks will share his perspective about the role of business in building an empathetic society and how his company is helping in this effort. Virginie Helias, Vice President Global Sustainability at P&G will share brand new insight into how P&G is looking to enable positive consumption in pursuit of the good life. Pashon Murray, Co-Founder of Detroit Dirt will demonstrate the opportunity for brands to contribute to the rejuvenation of cities in decline. Nadya Zhexembayeva, CEO of Reinvention Institute will offer perspective on why and how brands need to equip themselves for continuous reinvention in an increasingly dynamic world Leith Sharp, Director, Executive Education for Sustainability Leadership at Harvard University will offer a powerful model for enabling continuous transformational leadership into today’s organizations hindered by 20th century operating models. Ryan Williams, Good Cop at Method will share how Method is reinvigorating one community through local, sustainable manufacturing. Ricardo Caceres, Global Marketing Director for Sustainability at Coca-Cola will speak about embedding sustainability priorities within marketing and brand innovation teams. Nelson Switzer, Chief Sustainability Officer at Nestlé Waters will offer insight into how brands should orient themselves in the political fray post-US election. An integral component of SB’17 Detroit, the SB Activation Hub will encourage collaboration and celebrate purposeful innovation. Facilitated programming and anchor-led pavilions will showcase companies and entrepreneurs delivering innovative brands and business solutions fashioned around Good Food, Good Homes, Good Mobility, Good Packaging, Good Technology, Good Energy and more. Numerous companies and organizations have already joined this effort and have committed to supporting the ‘Redefining the Good Life’ global initiative and its launch at SB’17 Detroit. Lead sponsors include The Dow Chemical Company, BASF and Ford Motor Co. with varying sponsorship levels from Citizen Group, Nestlé, Target, Amazon, UPS, P&G, Whirlpool, Kellogg’s, Savers, GM, Braskem, Shaw Industries, WhiteWave Foods, the Vinyl Institute, NSF International, CVS Health and others. “Designing success in the 21st century begins with ‘Redefining the Good Life’ and imagining how the brand leaders of the future will respond by identifying new product and service offerings that meet evolving societal aspirations,” states KoAnn Vikoren Skrzyniarz, founder of Sustainable Brands. “Sustainable Brands is the preeminent platform for shining a light on the power of purpose to drive brand success. We desperately need the skills and passion of our courageous brand leaders to create a new collective vision of a flourishing future that delivers shared value for all.” Nature Bank is the official carbon offset partner, South Pole Group is the official renewable energy partner and Terracycle is a zero waste partner.

Here are four things you should know Africa is rapidly becoming one of the most desirable investment destinations. Picture: pixabay.com World Economic Forum Africa World Economic Forum 2017 Africa business Email Print Tweet Share World Economic Forum | 3 days ago DAVOS - Africa is home to seven of the 10 fastest-growing economies in the world, and despite the pre-conceived ideas of a continent forever plagued by disease, war and turmoil, it is rapidly becoming one of the most desirable investment destinations. Of course, the past two years have not been easy for the continent. In 2015, an economic slump saw GDP growth slow to 3.0%, down from 4.5% in 2014. In 2016, low commodity prices continued to impede growth, and expansion decelerated to lows not seen since the 2009 global financial crisis. But I believe 2017 will be the year the continent bounces back. Here’s why. 2017: AFRICA’S YEAR? While the headlines might be all about falling commodity prices, here on the ground I’m seeing something different: an environment where private sector-led investments is starting to flourish, in large part thanks to government-led far-reaching economic and political reforms Indeed, the business landscape has been rapidly changing, due to increased regional mobility, rapid urbanization and population growth, all of which has boosted demand for African-manufactured products and services. This, coupled with strong interconnectedness and a sense of pan-Africanism, has brought much optimism for businesses operating in the region. With the public sector facilitating the establishment of Africa’s biggest economic bloc – that may culminate in a Free Trade Area spanning Cape to Cairo – the next great investment destination for 2017 may very well be Africa. Take the example of agri-business, which has and always will be at the centre of growth in the continent. Recently, the continent has seen a surge of innovations that are accelerating agricultural productivity. For example, new platforms are providing farmers with information on commodity prices, the availability of buyers and sellers, and guidance on best practices in harvesting and disease management. FOUR SIGNS THAT THINGS ARE LOOKING UP IN AFRICA The rise of these innovations speaks to the progress and potential of Africa’s economy more broadly, its people and their ability to identify localized solutions for growth. But this isn’t the only clue as to Africa’s potential. In fact, I see four key trends driving large-scale private sector growth on the continent. These trends are not only shaping the strategies for existing companies but have also influenced the nature and appetite for joint venture projects across the continent. 1. Processing and value addition For a long time, development practitioners have emphasized need to give more attention to the processing of raw agricultural produce rather than exporting unprocessed agricultural commodities. Indeed, African governments have been promoting value addition for economic development for years, and yet there are still plenty of investment opportunities. Over 80% of value in the global food industry is in value-added components such as sorting, cleaning and packaging fruits and vegetables. The various forms of value-addition provide opportunities for the private sector to expand their commercial activities and access higher-value markets, either for domestic consumers or exports. Not only do they provide employment at all levels, but they have proven time and time again to drastically change the economic landscape of countries. A brilliant example of this is Kenya – the export value of fresh vegetables grew by as much as 250% after it stopped simply exporting raw material and started incorporating value-added tasks such as cleaning, packaging and freezing products. Similar to the fruit and vegetables sub-sectors, Africa’s cotton and apparel value chain have joined forces to integrate the global textile supply chain. In South Africa, the Aid by Trade Foundation entered into a partnership with the African Cotton and Textiles Industries Federation to promote the sustainable cotton and textile industry in Sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of this partnership was to increase productivity, competitiveness and sustainability of cotton production, and thus strengthen textile production in Africa. In Tanzania, the MeTL Group started out with cotton ginning operations for export. We then opened four textile factories for spinning and weaving of cotton in Tanzania and Mozambique. Today, we have launched our first ever garmenting factory which manufactures school uniforms, T-shirts and several cotton-apparel by-products. 2. Fast-moving consumer goods for Africa by Africa Africa is home to one of the world’s fastest growing populations and an exploding middle class with more disposable income than ever before. As a result, there is high demand for fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), such as apparel, hygiene products, food and electronics. Currently, almost all these products are still being imported. FMCG retailers tend to operate in low-margin environments, and as a result, large markets are crucial to their growth and success. With a rapidly growing continent and changing livelihoods, the potential for private sector actors in the FMCG space is promising for 2017 and beyond. McKinsey projects the growth of these consumer-facing industries will surpass $400 billion by 2020. Over the past few years, several African entrepreneurs have started local production using locally available material in manufacturing soaps, edible oils, household cleaning products, and even school uniforms. From local companies like Del Monte Kenya Limited, Tongaat Hulett, to foreign conglomerates like Unilever and Procter and Gamble, Africa’s FMCG sector has provided plenty of business opportunities, and there are some who say this could be the next “gold rush”. US retail giant Wal-Mart’s recent $2.5 billion dollar investment into South African retailer Massmart points that way. McKinsey have described this sector as the “single-largest business opportunity in Africa”. If these figures from the A.T. Kearney 2015 African Retail Development Index (ARDI) are anything to go by, that prediction is accurate. 3. ‘Bottom of the pyramid’ consumers Despite rapid socio-political advancements in Africa, only around half of people there earn more than $4 a day. While in Africa this might be categorized as “middle class”, manufactures locally and globally would still label them as low-income consumers, or the bottom of the pyramid (BOP) market. The competitive advantage of African owned and run businesses is that, unlike their foreign counterparts, they understand the purchasing decisions of the world's more than 5 billion low-income consumers, which gives them a competitive edge. Despite rapid socio-political advancements in Africa, only around half of people there earn more than $4 a day. While in Africa this might be categorized as “middle class”, manufactures locally and globally would still label them as low-income consumers, or the bottom of the pyramid (BOP) market. The competitive advantage of African owned and run businesses is that, unlike their foreign counterparts, they understand the purchasing decisions of the world's more than 5 billion low-income consumers, which gives them a competitive edge. When CK Prahalad's published The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid, he was speaking directly to the many African entrepreneurs that understood the world’s poor and their untapped buying power. Companies on the continent are learning how to serve these consumers while making money in the process. Single-use and/or low-cost products have been experiencing solid demand. Products like SC Johnson's individual mosquito coils for $0.01 and returnable 200ml bottles of Coca-Cola continue to be profitable because these companies have invested heavily in the logistics needed to reach BOP consumers, and have carried out market research on the packaging and disposable income required for poorer consumers to be able to buy their products. 4. African export market Export-led growth has been a successful strategy for several developing economies. Through incentive programmes and policies, African governments and multilateral donors have encouraged exports, which have allowed companies to further diversity their operations and reap the financial benefits. For a long time, the continent was not able to meet global export requirements. However, with the multiplicity of opportunities today – increased market linkages, partnership support, consultation, information sharing and tailored training for export trading – we’ve been able to take advantage of the global demand for African exports. With a growing world population and an imminent danger of global food shortages, Africa is well poised to become the breadbasket of the world. Africa’s exports will be critical to our development as a global society. The graph below illustrates the importance of commodities to different economies (dark blue and orange areas). These exports that continue to dominate many national economies will become extremely important in the growth of Africa’s private sector in 2017 and beyond. These four trends have been a long time in the making, but after a slow 2016, it looks like 2017 could be a good year for all those doing business in what is now one of the most exciting and dynamic regions in the world.

Materials companies led U.S. stocks modestly higher Friday, recouping much of the market's loss from a day earlier and snapping a five-day losing streak for the Dow Jones industrial average. Another crop of encouraging company earnings news helped lift the market, but investors were mostly focused on events in Washington as Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. The major stock indexes pulled back slightly as Trump delivered remarks after taking the oath of office. Among topics of particular interest to Wall Street, the speech touched on trade and the Trump administration's intention of protecting the United States from “the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.” “The market is still embracing the Trump agenda, based on the market's reaction to the speech,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. “Now the question the market has is, specifically, what does all of that mean in terms of trade?” The Dow rose 94.85 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,827.25. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 7.62 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,271.31. The Nasdaq composite index added 15.25 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,555.33. Despite Friday's gains, the three major stock indexes ended the week lower. Stocks have slowed in 2017 after surging for several weeks following Election Day on investor optimism that a Trump administration and Republican Congress would usher in business-friendly policies. But the possibility of increased tariffs or trade restrictions has also loomed as a potential drag in profits for big U.S. companies. “Historically, the market has performed best in the November-April time frame,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. “The Trump victory added a tailwind to this traditional seasonal factor.” Typically, stocks don't do well on inauguration day. Going back to 1928, the S&P has averaged a drop of 1.05 percent on inauguration days, according Bespoke Investment Group. Beyond the presidential transition in Washington, investors pored over the latest batch of corporate earnings Friday, bidding up shares in companies that reported results that beat Wall Street's expectations. Skyworks Solutions jumped 13 percent, the biggest gainer in the S&P 500. The stock climbed $10.21 to $88.67. Citizens Financial Group gained $1.09, or 3.1 percent, to $35.82. Traders also drove up shares in Procter & Gamble after the consumer goods maker released a strong growth forecast. The stock added $2.75, or 3.2 percent, to $87.45. Strong subscriber numbers helped lift AT&T, giving a boost to phone company stocks overall. AT&T added 45 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $41.45. Some companies' earnings failed to impress the market. General Electric slid 2.2 percent after the conglomerate reported fourth-quarter revenue that fell short of analysts' forecasts. The stock gave up 68 cents to $30.53. Investors sold off Bristol-Myers Squibb after the drugmaker said it won't pursue accelerated regulatory approval for a two-drug lung cancer treatment. The stock was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 index, shedding $6.26, or 11.3 percent, to $49.23. Major stock indexes overseas were mixed Friday. Germany's DAX rose 0.3 percent, while Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. France's CAC 40 added 0.2 percent. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 0.7 percent after the Chinese government said the economy grew at a 6.8 percent annual rate in the last quarter, even as full-year growth increased 6.7 percent, the weakest in three decades. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.3 percent. Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 2.47 percent. Yields have been rising as investors expect inflation to increase. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 114.31 yen from Thursday's 114.80 yen. The euro rose to $1.0707 from $1.0659. The British pound edged up to $1.2378 from $1.2337.

WSJ's Sue Shellenbarger and Tanya Rivero discuss how employees can use humor to their benefit. Photo: iStock By Sue Shellenbarger Sue Shellenbarger The Wall Street Journal BiographySue Shellenbarger Google+ Sue.Shellenbarger@wsj.com Jan. 24, 2017 10:51 a.m. ET 16 COMMENTS Colleagues who make others laugh are seen as more self-confident, competent and higher in status, according to a series of experiments by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and Harvard Business School. This conclusion, compelling for the many people who have spent on clothes, cars, credentials or coaching to burnish their image, has gotten some understandable attention recently. Laughs are a risky path to prestige, however: Tell just one inappropriate joke and your status among peers hits the skids. Humor is often seen as a sign of intelligence, and delivering a joke well requires sensitivity to others’ moods and tastes. John Thorne often uses self-deprecating humor to elevate his employees’ status among clients. As president of Automotive Events, a Cleveland-based producer of car-related promotions, he’s often the one who wins new clients. But when he introduces them to the employees who will be organizing and running their events, he jokes, “I don’t actually do anything. It’s these guys who do the work,” he says. When clients laugh, he says, “No seriously, I don’t do anything all day. I’m just here to make sure the coffee is pouring.” The gambit helps clients feel better about the transition to working with someone else, he says. Telling jokes can make leaders be seen as more confident and competent, but it also can bring executives down to employees’ level, making them seem more human and vulnerable, says Clayton Fletcher, a comedy consultant with Peppercomm, a strategic communications firm in New York City, who has coached Mr. Thorne. Past research has shown the value of workplace humor in easing stress, building rapport and increasing the productivity and creativity of teams. Sources: T. B. Bitterly and M. Schweitzer, The Wharton School The Wharton study is the first to assess the impact of joking on an individual’s status at work. Researchers asked a total of 2,300 participants in eight experiments to observe mock ad testimonials, view illustrated job interview transcripts and recall jokes told by co-workers. Participants rated each joke-teller’s status based on such criteria as how respected, powerful, admired and influential the person was likely to be in colleagues’ eyes. Simply recalling a funny joke by a co-worker elevated the joke-teller’s status in participants’ minds, says T. Bradford Bitterly, a doctoral candidate at Wharton and lead author on the study, published in November in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. “It shows how powerful humor can potentially be,” he says. Twenty-two-year-old Daniel Monarres of San Antonio believes his ability to poke fun at himself during an interview helped him win a slot in a highly competitive graduate program at Texas A&M University’s Mays Business School in College Station, Texas. When the interviewer asked about his hobbies and whether he played golf, Mr. Monarres admitted that he didn’t, then quipped that he served as trainer to his two college roommates, both expert golfers who played on the university team. The interviewer laughed and the conversation ended on a warm note, he says. Related Coverage Why Telling a Joke Pays Off for the Boss How to Build Instant Rapport in an Interview Secrets of Effective Office Humor Effective humor can trigger abrupt changes in people’s image. A soft-spoken introvert who “out of nowhere, in a deadpan manner, delivers a line that is super-funny,” can rocket to greater influence among co-workers, says Bob Kulhan, founder of Business Improv, a Chicago consulting firm, and author of “Getting to ‘Yes, And,’ ” a new book about using comedic skills at work. There’s plenty of joking going on in the workplace, and a lot of it is missing the target. While all but 1 of 200 participants surveyed by the Wharton researchers could recall a joke told by a co-worker, they rated nearly one-third of the jokes as inappropriate. There’s no risk to your reputation in telling an appropriate joke, even if it flops and no one laughs, the Wharton study shows. You’ll still be seen as confident. Sources: T. B. Bitterly and M. Schweitzer, The Wharton School Telling an inappropriate joke, however, can do serious damage. Participants in another Wharton study assessed the status of three job seekers who were asked in a simulated interview to suggest a creative use for an old tire. One drew a laugh by saying, “Someone doing CrossFit could use it for 30 minutes, then tell you about it forever.” The second made an inappropriate joke about turning the tire into condoms, and the third gave a serious response: “Make a tire swing out of it.” Participants rated the first joker highest in status, the serious respondent second and the applicant who made the off-color joke last. Figuring out whether a joke will fly requires deciding whether it meshes with the setting, listeners’ tastes and their purpose at the moment, says Andrew Tarvin, a New York City workplace humor coach and author who has taught comedy techniques to employees at Procter & Gamble, PricewaterhouseCoopers, GlaxoSmithKline and other companies. A joke can work even in a somber situation if it relieves tension. A wisecrack can flop badly, however, if the joker disregards listeners’ emotions: A CEO who jokes after a round of layoffs that he’s going to have to get a smaller yacht is likely to come across as aggressive and mean, says Mr. Tarvin. And spouting one-liners in a meeting where participants are intent on solving a complex problem isn’t likely to accomplish much more than annoying people. Work & Family Mailbox Q: Your column on what parents of teenage boys need to know was very helpful. What is the impact of kids’ heavy use of social media during such a fragile developmental period?—T.M. A: There’s some evidence linking social-media use to declines in children’s social skills and empathy. Preteens who spent five days at an overnight nature camp with no access to television, computers or mobile phones showed significant gains in their ability to read unspoken emotional cues in others’ faces, based on test scores before and after the camp session, according to a 2014 study led by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles. The campers’ scores rose more than scores of a control group of preteens who remained at school with their usual screen time. College students’ scores on a broader measure of empathy have fallen since 2000, according to a 30-year research review students’ responses to a standardized empathy scale. The results are based on students’ agreement with such statements as, “I often have tender, concerned feelings for people less fortunate than me,” and, “I sometimes try to understand my friends better by imagining how things look from their perspective.” Write to Sue Shellenbarger at sue.shellenbarger@wsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Most Popular Videos A Real-Life Alexa Lives With 'Alexa' Trump Discusses ISIS, Obamacare and Waterboarding The Dolphin: A Jetpack Hose to Tackle Waterfront Blazes Ferris Bueller 'Oh Yeah' Song Helps Co-Creator Earn Millions What Happens if President Trump Makes Changes to Nafta?

WSJ's Sue Shellenbarger and Tanya Rivero discuss how employees can use humor to their benefit. Photo: iStock By Sue Shellenbarger Sue Shellenbarger The Wall Street Journal BiographySue Shellenbarger Google+ Sue.Shellenbarger@wsj.com Jan. 24, 2017 10:51 a.m. ET 16 COMMENTS Colleagues who make others laugh are seen as more self-confident, competent and higher in status, according to a series of experiments by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and Harvard Business School. This conclusion, compelling for the many people who have spent on clothes, cars, credentials or coaching to burnish their image, has gotten some understandable attention recently. Laughs are a risky path to prestige, however: Tell just one inappropriate joke and your status among peers hits the skids. Humor is often seen as a sign of intelligence, and delivering a joke well requires sensitivity to others’ moods and tastes. John Thorne often uses self-deprecating humor to elevate his employees’ status among clients. As president of Automotive Events, a Cleveland-based producer of car-related promotions, he’s often the one who wins new clients. But when he introduces them to the employees who will be organizing and running their events, he jokes, “I don’t actually do anything. It’s these guys who do the work,” he says. When clients laugh, he says, “No seriously, I don’t do anything all day. I’m just here to make sure the coffee is pouring.” The gambit helps clients feel better about the transition to working with someone else, he says. Telling jokes can make leaders be seen as more confident and competent, but it also can bring executives down to employees’ level, making them seem more human and vulnerable, says Clayton Fletcher, a comedy consultant with Peppercomm, a strategic communications firm in New York City, who has coached Mr. Thorne. Past research has shown the value of workplace humor in easing stress, building rapport and increasing the productivity and creativity of teams. Sources: T. B. Bitterly and M. Schweitzer, The Wharton School The Wharton study is the first to assess the impact of joking on an individual’s status at work. Researchers asked a total of 2,300 participants in eight experiments to observe mock ad testimonials, view illustrated job interview transcripts and recall jokes told by co-workers. Participants rated each joke-teller’s status based on such criteria as how respected, powerful, admired and influential the person was likely to be in colleagues’ eyes. Simply recalling a funny joke by a co-worker elevated the joke-teller’s status in participants’ minds, says T. Bradford Bitterly, a doctoral candidate at Wharton and lead author on the study, published in November in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. “It shows how powerful humor can potentially be,” he says. Twenty-two-year-old Daniel Monarres of San Antonio believes his ability to poke fun at himself during an interview helped him win a slot in a highly competitive graduate program at Texas A&M University’s Mays Business School in College Station, Texas. When the interviewer asked about his hobbies and whether he played golf, Mr. Monarres admitted that he didn’t, then quipped that he served as trainer to his two college roommates, both expert golfers who played on the university team. The interviewer laughed and the conversation ended on a warm note, he says. Related Coverage Why Telling a Joke Pays Off for the Boss How to Build Instant Rapport in an Interview Secrets of Effective Office Humor Effective humor can trigger abrupt changes in people’s image. A soft-spoken introvert who “out of nowhere, in a deadpan manner, delivers a line that is super-funny,” can rocket to greater influence among co-workers, says Bob Kulhan, founder of Business Improv, a Chicago consulting firm, and author of “Getting to ‘Yes, And,’ ” a new book about using comedic skills at work. There’s plenty of joking going on in the workplace, and a lot of it is missing the target. While all but 1 of 200 participants surveyed by the Wharton researchers could recall a joke told by a co-worker, they rated nearly one-third of the jokes as inappropriate. There’s no risk to your reputation in telling an appropriate joke, even if it flops and no one laughs, the Wharton study shows. You’ll still be seen as confident. Sources: T. B. Bitterly and M. Schweitzer, The Wharton School Telling an inappropriate joke, however, can do serious damage. Participants in another Wharton study assessed the status of three job seekers who were asked in a simulated interview to suggest a creative use for an old tire. One drew a laugh by saying, “Someone doing CrossFit could use it for 30 minutes, then tell you about it forever.” The second made an inappropriate joke about turning the tire into condoms, and the third gave a serious response: “Make a tire swing out of it.” Participants rated the first joker highest in status, the serious respondent second and the applicant who made the off-color joke last. Figuring out whether a joke will fly requires deciding whether it meshes with the setting, listeners’ tastes and their purpose at the moment, says Andrew Tarvin, a New York City workplace humor coach and author who has taught comedy techniques to employees at Procter & Gamble, PricewaterhouseCoopers, GlaxoSmithKline and other companies. A joke can work even in a somber situation if it relieves tension. A wisecrack can flop badly, however, if the joker disregards listeners’ emotions: A CEO who jokes after a round of layoffs that he’s going to have to get a smaller yacht is likely to come across as aggressive and mean, says Mr. Tarvin. And spouting one-liners in a meeting where participants are intent on solving a complex problem isn’t likely to accomplish much more than annoying people. Work & Family Mailbox Q: Your column on what parents of teenage boys need to know was very helpful. What is the impact of kids’ heavy use of social media during such a fragile developmental period?—T.M. A: There’s some evidence linking social-media use to declines in children’s social skills and empathy. Preteens who spent five days at an overnight nature camp with no access to television, computers or mobile phones showed significant gains in their ability to read unspoken emotional cues in others’ faces, based on test scores before and after the camp session, according to a 2014 study led by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles.

The US-founded company will see former BBC Worldwide executive Robert Leach take the helm as general manager. Peter Birch, managing director of 1st Screen, will be Kargo’s commercial director, while Rob Williams, also previously with BBC Worldwide, will be operations director. Leach: Leading Kargo’s APAC launch Kargo claims to be “invitation only” in which publishers and advertisers it works with, on what it says are only as premium content sites. The Australian office – which is a prelude to a launch into Asia Pacific – joins Kargo’s offices in London, Chicago, New York and Los Angeles. Kargo employs around 250 people globally. Leach will report to Kargo’s international GM Owen Hanks. Hanks said in a statement: “Many of the global publishers and top brands that Kargo works with in North America and the UK have encouraged us to continue our international expansion into the Asia Pacific region where there is a growing demand for quality mobile advertising. “I’m confident that Robert, Peter and Rob are the right team.” Among the brands working with Kargo are Unilever, P&G and L’Oreal, while publishers include Bauer, The New York Times and CBS Interactive. Leach moved to Australia in 2006 as head of Multichannel Network’s digital division MCN Connect after previously working for British satellite broadcaster BSkyB, where he led the company’s commercial team, focusing on its interactive red button services. Leach left MCN in 2011 and until late last year worked as director of strategy, business development and digital for BBC Worldwide. Birch: Previously 1st Screen MD Meanwhile, Birch joins the company from Mobile Embrace’s mobile marketing offering, 1st Screen, where he’s been since 2010. Before that, he was head of digital for Network Ten from 2007 to 2010, and before that was in the UK as head of interactive sales for the country’s largest commercial broadcaster, ITV. Williams: Led BBC’s direct-to-consumer digital offerings Williams joined BBC Worldwide in 2013 as a commercial analyst, before becoming head of consumer digital, retail and wholesale in 2015.

Cramer found five themes that can continue to roar higher and rebuke even the biggest doubters of the rally. They were housing, earnings, deregulation, higher oil, higher rates and the strength in materials stocks. "Aside from the deregulation component, most of this rally would have occurred regardless of Trump's initiatives, which means this move might be a lot more sustainable than the doubters would have you believe," the "Mad Money" host said. D.R. Horton reported strong earnings on Tuesday and confirmed orders were up 15 percent. This matters because mortgage rates went up this quarter too. Typically when rates go up, housing gets hit. Instead, the largest homebuilder had a surprisingly strong level of confidence. Horton even said better employment will lead to better housing demand. Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty Images The U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, Jan. 3, 2017. Even better than interest rates rising are the increasing commodity prices. Rates must continue to climb for bank stocks to maintain momentum. If the Fed listened to the Horton conference call, than that means the plan to hike interest rates three times in 2017 is in the agenda, Cramer said. Suddenly investors were scrambling to get back into bank stocks. Deregulation signaled more job creation in the U.S. to Cramer, and Trump's appointments mean deregulation for Cramer. If the Dakota Access pipeline is approved, it will require people, plants and equipment. "It is really clear to me that Trump is appointing regulators who hate regulation," Cramer said. There are so many large projects that could be in the works to move natural gas it could mean hundreds of thousands of people are put to work on the pipelines. Cramer attributed this to the reason why materials stocks rallied, with his top pick as Martin Marietta and Magellan Midstream Partners for pipelines. Trump may want automakers to build in the U.S., but green lighting pipelines could create far more jobs very quickly, Cramer said. Another strong theme was the re-evaluation of earnings in a positive way after an initial drop. IBM, American Express and Procter & Gamble have come roaring back since initially reporting. The last component was technology, as red-hot semiconductor equipment makers like Applied Materials and Lam Research were the reason Cramer thinks the Nasdaq took out its old high. Strong demand for DRAM chips and flash memory is good for companies like Micron and Skyworks Solutions. "These stories aren't going to be delayed by Congress. They are independent of it. That is why the market vaulted higher today when so many people were expecting the opposite," Cramer said. Questions for Cramer?

Celebrity make-up artist Charlotte Tilbury, whose clients include Kate Moss, Amal Clooney and J. K.

Celebrity make-up artist Charlotte Tilbury (right), has given Helen Mirren (left) an extraordinary dressing-down after the actress claimed it would be ‘wonderful’ if women stopped wearing make-up ‘I totally disagree with Helen. She’s absolutely wrong — completely wrong,’ Tilbury, 42, tells me. ‘Why would anyone, in a world where everyone is judged by their looks, not wear make-up? ‘I’m not saying do a full-on glamour look all the time: it can be very sophisticated and chic at the same time as being natural, like the Jennifer Aniston look.’ RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next Longleat lovebirds face £2.6m tax battle after HMRC conducts... SEBASTIAN SHAKESPEARE: Is Nuclear Wintour set to become... SEBASTIAN SHAKESPEARE: Plutocrats donate £6million to Prince... Share this article Share While promoting the new Pirelli calendar last month, in which she features wearing hardly any make-up, Mirren, 71, said: ‘It would be wonderful if it became more fashionable not to wear make-up. ‘I suspect that we might have reached saturation with the whole selfie thing and maybe we’re moving in another direction.’ Among Charlotte Tilbury's celebrity clients are Kate Moss (left) and Amal Clooney (right) It triggered a wave of make-up free selfies on social media by celebrities including ITV breakfast presenter Susanna Reid. But Tilbury, who was speaking at the Debrett’s 500 Gala at Bafta in Piccadilly, insists women need warpaint more than ever. ‘Make-up is very empowering and women should celebrate this weapon in their arsenal. Women need to wear make-up to get ahead in life — in their careers, in the personal lives, whatever it is,’ she adds. ‘There have been studies that Harvard, Procter & Gamble and Stanford University have done that prove women earn up to 50 per cent more money by the way that they do their make-up and hair. Tilbury said that beauty products make a woman look 'very sophisticated and chic at the same time as being natural' like actress Jennifer Aniston ‘I have met Helen, and I like her; she’s a wonderful woman. But I’m afraid she is absolutely wrong. ‘I haven’t worked with her before but I would because she’s totally incredible. But, hello, she does understand the power of make-up. ‘I’ve seen her: she loves dressing up, she loves make-up, she knows the power of looking good.’ Corbyn's £951 alarms bill Loony Leftie Jeremy Corbyn is clear on his views about national security — he wants to ditch Britain’s nuclear defence. But when it comes to personal security, he’s rather more enthusiastic. According to his newly published expenses, he billed taxpayers for £951 for ‘personal alarms’.  The claim was made in August at the height of his campaign to hold on to the Labour leadership.  According to his newly published expenses, Jeremy Corbyn billed taxpayers for £951 for ‘personal alarms’ Pointedly, it came at the time he was being accused as not doing enough to protect his opponents in the party from intimidation. The figure is lodged under the heading security, but does not specify what type of alarm and accounted for 10 per cent of £9,500 claimed in this financial year. TV hardman Ross Kemp has revealed that he is on his third set of front teeth. The 52-year-old actor, who played Grant Mitchell in EastEnders, explains: ‘The first ones were kicked out playing rugby and the second ones on a really bad night in Caracas, as you do . . . I don’t remember much about it, but I did wake up the next morning with everyone looking at me, and I was going: “What? What?” TV hardman Ross Kemp, who played Grant Mitchell in EastEnders, has revealed that he is on his third set of front teeth ‘I found out I had broken all the fascias as I hit the marble bar and I said: “I will never drink again.” ‘But I have only stuck with that a little bit!’ Prince Charles is such a devotee of Scottish poet Robert Burns that he was once recorded reading two of his poems for the BBC.  Tonight, the heir to the throne is holding a charity Burns Night at Highgrove, where up to 100 guests paying £95 each will be served haggis while bagpipes play in the background.  ‘Brush off your kilt and don your tartan to celebrate Burns Night in true Scottish style at Highgrove,’ gushes the advert. Sadly, the event will be missing one vital ingredient — the Prince himself.     Share or comment on this article e-mail 87 shares Most watched News videos Pizza Hut customer finds workers in the back of empty restaurant in Bristol Graphic: NZ Breakers player's eye dislodged in horrific injury Shocking CCTV shows car speed into Humber Bridge barrier 'There goes that relationship' Trump's quip to BBC question Heartwarming scene as Grayce shares her puppies with owner Florida couple passed out in their car with two children in the backseat A close look at the huge crack formed across Arizona desert Enraged man punches laptop and quits job during 'meltdown' at airport Alarming moment guy violently pushes man onto tube tracks Bizarre footage of multiple UFOs hovering near Mexican border CCTV shows brave man fighting nunchuck-wielding robbers Inauguration etiquette 101: Escort First Lady up White House steps Settling in nicely!

New executive hires Robert Leach, Peter Birch and Rob Williams will play key roles in continuing to drive the company’s international growth. The Sydney office marks Kargo’s second global location outside of the U.S., following the 2016 launch of its flagship international office in London. The Surry Hills location is in the heart of Sydney’s digital media district and will serve as a hub for clients and publishing partners in Australia and New Zealand. Kargo plans to continue its growth into the Asia Pacific region by doubling its local workforce by the end of the year. As the first Sydney-based Kargo employees, Robert Leach will serve as General Manager, Asia Pacific, Peter Birch as Commercial Director, Asia Pacific and Rob Williams as Operations Director, Asia Pacific. Birch and Williams will work under Leach, and Leach will report to Owen Hanks, who was named Kargo’s first General Manager, International in 2016 and tasked with leading the company’s worldwide expansion. “Many of the global publishers and top brands that Kargo works with in North America and the U.K. have encouraged us to continue our international expansion into the Asia Pacific region where there is a growing demand for quality mobile advertising,” said Hanks. “I’m confident that Robert Leach, Peter Birch and Rob Williams are the right team to bring Kargo’s high-impact ad formats and massive alliance of premium publishers to Australia and New Zealand.” “Australia is a natural spring board for Kargo given the region’s established media and advertising industries,” said Leach. “As mobile usage grows exponentially in Asia Pac, the premium editorial alliance provided by Kargo will afford brands the ideal environment and scale in which to advertise. This coupled with our award winning creative, zero ad fraud and the highest viewability scores in market will undoubtedly attract ANZ brand advertisers to Kargo.” During his 20 years of experience in the advertising and media industries, Leach has successfully launched and grown the digital businesses for some of the world's largest media brands, including BBC Worldwide, News Corp and BSkyB. Birch’s experience in traditional and emerging media sales includes work with mobile, broadcast and digital platforms in the U.K. and Australia. Williams joins Kargo from BBC Worldwide, where he led the development of the company’s direct-to-consumer digital offerings in the Australia and New Zealand markets. Kargo’s expansion into the Asia Pacific region follows a record-breaking 2016 in which the company grew its workforce by nearly 60%, launched its programmatic software business, completed its first major mobile ad research initiative and was recognized for its growth and achievements on lists such as the Inc. 500 and the Entrepreneur 360. Kargo is the only mobile advertising company that creates rich-media campaigns for 200+ brands (including Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Verizon and L’Oréal) and partners exclusively with an alliance of handpicked publishers (such as Bauer, The New York Times and CBS Interactive) – reaching an audience that rivals Google and Facebook in terms of scale. ABOUT KARGO Kargo is the leader in mobile brand advertising. Bringing together creativity, technology and quality, Kargo empowers advertisers to break convention and build connections with consumers on the most important screen today – the phone.

The global skincare product industry is expected to reach an estimated $135.1 billion by 2021 and is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 3.8% by value from 2016 to 2021. The major drivers for the growth for this market are increasing awareness among consumers about skin care and consumers' inclination towards multi-functional skincare creams. This report has 230 figures/charts and 15 tables spread through 220 pages. For more detail on this report please click link http://www.lucintel.com/skincare_product_industry_2016_2021.aspx In this industry, facial care, body and hand care, depilatories, and sun care are the major segments by product type. On the basis of comprehensive research, Lucintel forecasts that the facial care segment is expected to show above average growth during the forecast period. Within the skincare product industry, facial care is expected to be the largest segment by value and volume. Growth in demand for skincare products is largely dependent on growing health awareness regarding sunburn damage and an increase in penetration of multi-functional skincare products in applications like anti-aging and skin lightening. Anti-aging creams are also combined with sun protection properties to be used as multifunctional skincare creams, which would spur growth for this segment over the forecast period. Asia Pacific is expected to remain the largest market due to the increasing population and rising per capita income in this region. The APAC region is expected to witness significant growth over the forecast period because of the rise in population and in disposable income; also, there is increasing awareness about appearance, especially in India, China, Japan, and South Korea. For business expansion, the report suggests innovation and new product development to produce skincare products which have excellent transparency, outstanding dispersing properties, and better functional benefits for the end user. The report further suggests the development of partnerships with customers to develop user friendly skincare products.

Published: 13:56 January 24, 2017 Manoj Nair, Associate Editor   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Dubai: Content matters — and that’s true as much for the advertising industry as it is for publishers fighting a daily battle against the forces of digital. And in a content-driven space, its originators matter just as much. “The advertising industry model needs to change ... until recently, most agencies worked on a model where originators and creators were outnumbered by the marketers and distributors of content,” said Avi Bhojani, Group CEO at BPG, one of the biggest marketing services networks in the region. “You look at the cost structure of any agency and there is a greater cost around [marketing] distribution. “What’s worse is that the content creators have also got used to being in a box — they now need to go direct with their clients and [reduce dependence on] the intermediaries. There is no more need for so many sales and distribution people who were thriving on content created by others. “People are eliminating overheads on one side; the jargon for that is ‘complexity reduction’. Some may call it restructuring. That’s what’s needed. “People prefer to meet the creators of the content rather than layers of intermediaries. We need to smell the coffee and get back to that. “With less intermediaries, you need more productive resources and less layers of message conveyors. That’s how the advertising industry will be tomorrow. “We have to start working on lower margins … and our services have to cost less.” These are combative words from an ad industry insider who has clocked in 35 years fighting and winning many a battle. And he’s gearing up for more — his agency network has just gone through some far-reaching changes its management structure. It has created more focused teams and with direct responsibilities in creating the solutions clients want. “Responsibility and authority became more aligned … we had layers with business heads in a few businesses were not adding value with clients. Those positions have been knocked off.” (Bhojani rates three of BPG’s business units — led by BPG Maxus, followed by BPG Kuwait and BPG Cohn&Wolfe — as performing well, while two — BPG Bates and BPG Possible — had a “challenging year”.) Which brings Bhojani back to the hot-potato issue of what sort of content should be out there. With the word “fake” preceding news and fake websites proliferating to try and dupe advertisers of their ad spends. “Both publishing and marketing services have a huge repository of content and an ability to create newer content,” said Bhojani. “Whichever model you look at, the need is for credible content. If it gets fictitious, the kind of harm it creates on reputations is often irreparable. “It’s still a work in progress, within distinct parts making up digital assets. Digital asset creation needs one set of skills. The other aspect is its amplification on social media. Within that, there is both content and production. “Everyone knows that in social media, moving images gives you exponentially more impact than static. That’s why the smart money is on Instagram than Twitter. A year ago, Twitter felt like everything. With Instagram, the static is moving away. There are crowdsourcing sites which can do your logo for $50. “Tomorrow’s marketing services organisations will come back to where your marketing communications service provider covered all your needs.” For advertising agencies in the Middle East, the changes brought on by the digital revolution have not been easy. At a certain point, it was never going to be enough to set up “digital-facing agencies” within their networks and keep hoping the business will keep on coming. But, as everyone knows, that’s not how it turned out. Digital platforms are themselves turning into media powerhouses, whether it be as a source to take in news or get acquainted with instant marketing messages. “Everyone in communication needs to be concerned — Google and Facebook are connecting directly with brand owners. eliminating intermediaries,” said Bhojani. “And then you have the big consulting companies in downward integration — Accenture has bought a hot creative boutique in London, and McKinsey a branding shop in the US as have Deloitte and others. “The ad industry is sandwiched — there is no substitute to us having to reinvent quickly. We need to go in for some degree of rescaling. “Any restructuring essentially ensures that the way resourcing is done is right. People who are responsible for client relationships need to be more empowered Elsewhere, the generic agency networks are effecting change. WPP, the world’s largest marketing communications group and which has a minority stake in BPG, has already “done the team structure”. “Across different agencies and functions they deliver to one client — some of these teams will get bigger and some will bundle into one brand. “More global marketers are centralising their brand decision making — P&G, Pepsi, Unilever. Earlier, in every country they had would have localised brand decisions. Today, the only local need is activation and media buying. “Ad agencies are finding it difficult to cope with that.” But there is one detail Bhojani hopes will still be retained among the changes convulsing the industry — the unique culture that defines each ad agency and that shows up in its creative content, its people and the way they work. “The culture bit is critical in our business — I’m not 100 per cent sure where we as an industry are headed to. But I would still hope that our unique culture will help us differentiate and re-emerge.” Part-time workers can become the new theme for local ad industry With local laws now allowing businesses to tap part-timers, the ad industry should use every opportunity to utilise the opportunities, says Avi Bhojani of BPG Group. “There are tens of thousands of graduates passing through local colleges and there could be many among them who want to be in advertising,” he said. “There are issues involved with taking in part-timers, but these are manageable. It will mean less need for full-time employees and keeping costs in check.” The BPG network is finalising the launch of a boutique agency that will cater to the marketing services needs of start-ups and small businesses. tags from this storyUnited States follow this tag on MGNDubai follow this tag on MGNFacebook follow this tag on MGNGoogle follow this tag on MGNTwitter follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessSectorsMedia tagsUnited States follow this tag on MGN+ MGNDubai follow this tag on MGN+ MGNFacebook follow this tag on MGN+ MGNGoogle follow this tag on MGN+ MGNTwitter follow this tag on MGN+ MGN FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosPictures 01Why content matters in the age of fake 02The post digital marketing world is well upon us 03Brands learn to play by social media rules Play Abu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Nov 24, 2016 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Inside Emirates airline's engineering hangar Sep 20, 2015 Play Emirati who created 2 successful companies Jan 02, 2016 20Images Highlights: SIHH luxury watch show Jan 18, 2017 9Images Pictures: Mohammad Bin Zayed in Mumbai Feb 13, 2016 34Images Dubai Shopping Festival 2012 in pictures Jan 31, 2012 10Images LG unveils flagship V20 smartphone Sep 07, 2016 Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Gulf News Brand Report   newspaper101,358 average daily circulation   WEB1,891,986 Gulf News average unique browsers   MOBILE1,729,966 mobile average unique browsers   FACEBOOK1,910,659 average Facebook likes *FOR THE 6 MONTH PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 2015DOWNLOAD PDF Most Popular on Gulf News Mohammad concludes three-day India visit No visa-free facility for Indians here...
