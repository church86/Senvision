THE INSIDER AUTHORITY ON GATOR SPORTS Florida Gators gymnastics celebrate a good 2016 season- GatorCountry photo taken by David Bowie Other Sports Pair of standout gymnasts sign with Florida Gators gymnastics Home Other Sports Pair of standout gymnasts sign with Florida Gators gymnastics Written by Andrew Spivey, November 9, 2016, 0 Comments, GAINESVILLE, Fla. - A pair of top gymnasts will join the Florida Gators gymnastics team for
the 2018 season, Gator head coach Jenny
Rowland announced Wednesday.

Megan Skaggs, a 2014-15 member of the U.S. Senior National Team, has been a part of
winning U.S. teams at the 2015 Pan American Games and City of Jesolo Trophy. Vanasia
Bradley (pronounced vuh-NAY-suh) was a top junior division elite level gymnast. She
missed two seasons recovering from injuries, but made her competitive return earlier
this year.

"Megan and Vanasia are both talented gymnasts. They will come in and be contributors
on each event," Rowland said. "I think overall their enthusiasm, determination,
excitement to come to college and start their new chapter in life is very
refreshing. I know they both bring a very strong work ethic and I feel like their
college careers are going to be very successful."

Coach Rowland says:
"She is a very talented athlete who unfortunately has been injured for some time.
Her senior year should be her first year back after two years of not competing. She
is a dynamic and powerful athlete. Vanasia is also very technically sound which will
be an asset for her collegiate routines. She should be a good contributor to us on
all the events. Vanasia should be able to jump right into vault and floor for us,
but believe that uneven bars is one of her best events. We are excited to have a
little more depth on bars next year."

very dedicated, methodical and loves gymnastics. Her grace is a stand-out aspect of
her gymnastics. She's a very elegant athlete to watch. Expect Megan to be a

Jean MarbellaContact ReporterThe Baltimore Sun Political rifts took their strain on marriages and friendships, what happens now that the election is over? Three priests stood outside a polling place Tuesday in Timonium pondering the sacred and the secular. "My congregation has a bunch of families divided — it's a microcosm of the larger country," said the Rev. Kristofer Lindh-Payne, rector of Epiphany Episcopal Church in Baltimore County. "We do stay together, even though we are divided," he said, as voters streamed in and out of Pot Spring Elementary School. "But what will the aftermath be like, if no matter who wins, a large part of our country is going to be grieving?" The presidential campaign has been so bruising and divisive that Lindh-Payne and other priests made themselves available in polling places, churches and other venues for voters who needed a healing prayer or two. Husbands and wives, parents and children, office mates, real-life and Facebook friends have found themselves on opposite sides — with the ballots they cast Tuesday not necessarily resolving the standoff. Hillary Clinton wins Maryland easily Michael Dresser Hillary Clinton scored a thumping victory Tuesday over Donald Trump in Maryland on the strength of Democratic votes in the state's urban regions.

Hillary Clinton scored a thumping victory Tuesday over Donald Trump in Maryland on the strength of Democratic votes in the state's urban regions. Maryland was one of the first states called in the presidential race after the polls closed at 8 p.m. Never regarded as a battleground state, it received... (Michael Dresser) "I get to cancel out my husband," Jan Keadle said of her vote for Hillary Clinton. Keadle, 57, ran the mile or so from her house to Pot Spring Elementary, having tucked a small American flag into her headband and wearing matching shorts. It was a festive day for many across the state. But for politically mixed marriages like hers, Keadle, a mother of two who works for a printing company and runs marathons, domestic peace required a certain diplomacy — if not outright avoidance. "There was a lot of changing of the subject — 'OK, let's cut it off here,' " Keadle said. "We had to cut it off in the bedroom." Chris Van Hollen wins Maryland's open Senate seat, will succeed Barbara A. Mikulski John Fritze Rep. Chris Van Hollen won Maryland's open Senate seat Tuesday, capping a nearly two-year campaign in which the seven-term Democratic lawmaker argued that his ability to navigate a polarized Congress would enable him to carry on the legacy of his popular predecessor. The 57-year-old Montgomery County... Rep. Chris Van Hollen won Maryland's open Senate seat Tuesday, capping a nearly two-year campaign in which the seven-term Democratic lawmaker argued that his ability to navigate a polarized Congress would enable him to carry on the legacy of his popular predecessor. The 57-year-old Montgomery County... (John Fritze) Similarly, another voter at Pot Spring, Jerry Wojtowycz, 60, said he and his golfing and fishing buddies kept the peace by avoiding talk of politics. "We decided we couldn't convince each other to vote for the opponent," said the retired Procter and Gamble tech services worker, a Trump supporter. "We basically stayed away from it." After such an angry campaign season, there was palpable relief in the civic ritual of voting. "We're ready for this to be over, and hopefully the result will be conclusive and we can move on," said Mildred Charles, 43, of Upper Marlboro. She participated in early voting, casting her ballot for Clinton a few days ago so she could spend Tuesday promoting a Prince George's County school board candidate. "At first, it was entertaining. I watched all the debates. I pulled out the popcorn," Charles, an adjunct communications professor, said of the campaign. "It's no longer entertainment. This is serious." She now feels differently about a childhood friend who ardently supports Trump, and maintained a silence-is-golden stance toward her husband, who said he remained undecided as late as Tuesday morning. Joseph Butler, 62, liked some of Trump's truth-telling — although he also thought it went too far. "It's only brought up the ugliness in people that's always been there," he said. But he said the national airing of grievances will be cathartic, a necessary step before anyone can try to heal the rift. "It's therapy for the country," Butler said. In Hagerstown, a couple supporting Trump also welcomed the end of the campaign. "With the way the mainstream press has covered this, it has been nonstop — you couldn't avoid it," said Brian Robak, 43, as he and his wife, Rae, 35, left their polling place. Robak, a business owner, decried what he considered the "overwhelming" pro-Clinton bias of their 12-year-old son's teachers. Rae Robak, who teaches grade school in West Virginia, found a decided anti-Clinton sentiment there. She decided to stop teaching government and civics in class over the last few weeks because "every time I did, things blew up. "You should have heard what they've been saying," she said " 'Hillary's a killer,' 'Hillary will take our religion away,' 'Hillary's worthless.' It has been almost scary. I decided, 'Let's focus on science for a few weeks. We'll come back to social studies after the election.'" In this most dyspeptic of campaigns, there were voters who were dissatisfied with both choices on the ballot. None of the above, or at least none of the major candidates, was Edwina Harlee's choice at Hazelwood Elementary/Middle School in Northeast Baltimore. "If I had voted for either of them, I would have sold my soul to the devil," said Harlee, 33, who works for a medication delivery service. For many, the campaign raised issues that were deeply personal — from the kind of sexual harassment Trump was accused of, to the question of what to do about immigration. The latter was a concern for John Zaunfuchs, a 56-year-old Republican, who voted for Trump at Goldsboro Fire Hall in rural Caroline County on the Eastern Shore. He's met immigrants in his community of Marydel and is concerned about those who aren't learning English or trying to assimilate into American culture. "They're good people, but there's a right way and a wrong way," said Zaunfuchs, who is semiretired from the printing industry. In immigrant-rich Montgomery County, the issue was particularly personal, especially among Hispanics. Clinton won the support of Gloria Y. Arevalo, a 27-year-old paralegal, and her mother, Gloria M. Arevalo, 58, a cook for the Montgomery County school system who moved to the United States years ago from El Salvador. They voted at James Hubert Blake High School in Silver Spring. Trump's rhetoric about building a wall on the country's southern border helped make their decision an easy one. "Donald Trump wants to get rid of all Mexicans or all Hispanics in general," the younger Arevalo said. "In general, we don't want to see families separated. It's not a good thing. People are coming here looking for a better life." But another immigrant, J.D. Chawla, a 49-year-old financial planner who says he has "an American flag carved inside my heart," cast his vote for Trump. Originally from India, he and his wife, Tammy, brought their 8- and 12-year-old children to the polls to witness what he calls "a very pivotal election." "It changes the dynamic of the future of this country and the economics of this country and the track that we will end up taking significantly," Chawla said. Like others across the state, he worries about what will happen after the polls close and a victor emerges. He predicted a Clinton victory would leave the country divided. "I think the rift will continue, because there's a sense of despair among many," he said. "There's a sense of, 'No, not this again for another four years,' and possibly even eight years." Richard Sherrill, 77, similarly expressed a bleak outlook at odds with the rolling countryside surrounding his polling place, the Veronica "Roni" Chenowith Activity Center in Fallston in Harford County. "The Constitution will be ignored if one candidate wins — Hillary," the retiree said. "If [Trump] loses, I will wear black on Wednesday. And a flag pin upside down." In counterpoint was the thrill others felt at the prospect of the nation's electing its first female president. "It would let women and young girls see that you can reach for the stars," said Tanya McAllister, 40, of Timonium, the controller at an area staffing firm. That sentiment, though, was tempered by her lingering concerns over Clinton's using a private server for her emails, the subject of an investigation that kept popping up as late as last week. And yet, she said, the idea of Trump as president was worse. "The face of the country is at stake," she said.

As a part of the plan, the Board announced that effective November 14, 2016, Christopher D. Sliva will be appointed President and also will join the AdvancePierre Board of Directors.

Under John’s leadership, AdvancePierre has implemented the APF way, our sustainable improvement program which transformed our business performance and enhanced our margin profile. We look forward to continuing to benefit from John’s experience and guidance as Chief Executive Officer throughout the transition period.” Simons commented: “AdvancePierre is on a solid and steady path for continued success. I’m extremely proud of our team’s many accomplishments over the past several years, perhaps most notably around our successful NYSE debut and the work that followed to establish AdvancePierre on strong footing as a public company. For all of these reasons, I came to the decision that now is the right time to initiate this change, and the Board agreed that a smooth transition beginning with Chris’ appointment as President was the ideal next step. I am looking forward to working alongside Chris over the coming months, and I am confident that the future is bright for AdvancePierre.” As President, Sliva will work closely alongside Simons on the oversight and management of the company’s operating activities and to ensure a seamless transition of responsibilities. Sliva is a recognized leader and operator with over a decade’s experience as a public food company executive. Before joining AdvancePierre, Sliva was President and Chief Operating Officer at TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (NYSE:THS), a leading manufacturer of food and beverage products with more than 50 manufacturing facilities across the United States, Canada and Italy. Sliva joined TreeHouse in July 2012 as Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of its Bay Valley Foods operating unit and also served as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of TreeHouse and President of Bay Valley during his time at the company. Before that, Sliva spent six years as an executive at Dean Foods (NYSE:DF), including as Chief Commercial Officer of Dean’s subsidiary Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar, Chief Customer Officer for Dean's White Wave Foods division and President and Chief Operating Officer for the Morningstar division. Previously, Sliva held various leadership roles and sales and marketing positions with Eastman Kodak Company, Fort James Corporation and Procter & Gamble Distributing Company. Hollis continued: “I am very pleased to welcome Chris to AdvancePierre. Having spent a significant part of his career working in a customer-focused environment, Chris is well-equipped to reinforce and build upon AdvancePierre’s customer-centric approach. Chris also shares our passion for food and his highly relevant experience as a senior executive with publicly-traded food and beverage companies strongly positions him to lead AdvancePierre through its next phase of growth.” Sliva said: “I have watched AdvancePierre’s amazing progress over the past several years and I admire the spirit of collaboration, innovation and continuous improvement deeply-rooted in every aspect of the business. I am excited to work with John and the rest of the talented team during this transition period as we strive to deliver even greater value for customers and sustained profitable growth and value for shareholders.” About AdvancePierre Foods AdvancePierre Foods Holdings, Inc.

Half Of Razors Sold At Target Now From Harry’s Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Half Of Razors Sold At Target Now From Harry’s Image courtesy of hodad66 November 9, 2016 5:33 pm EST By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup razor wars harry's gilette target Earlier this year, Harry’s, the online razor subscription service that isn’t Dollar Shave Club, began selling its products in Target stores. The startup put up cool displays shaped like a giant orange razor, and soon half of the razor handles sold at Target were from Harry’s. One-tenth of the blade cartridges sold were from Harry’s. Dominant razor seller Gillette was not pleased. After the displays come down and Harry’s products go back on the regular shelf with other brands, sales will probably fall again. What’s interesting, though, is the reason why the products came to Target in the first place. Target wanted to bring back shoppers who have been buying a lot of their consumables online, and Harry’s was looking for new places to retail its razors. The partnership worked, based on each company’s research about its own customers. Harry’s knew that its main customers, men, would rather buy razors and blades in person, but don’t like the price points and products available in regular stores. Target shoppers, meanwhile, were looking for “something different,” according to the chain’s vice president of beauty and personal care. “We think Harry’s is filling a niche that wasn’t currently being met.” Meanwhile, Procter & Gamble’s Gillette saw its sales fall during the Harry’s promotion, and the company now realizes that it needs to watch its back, especially now that subscription blade company Dollar Shave Club has the backing of its rival consumer products conglomerate, Unilever. Gillette now has its own subscription service, but is that enough to stay competitive when the new competitors are right there on store shelves too?

What Trump's win means for companies, local economy Alexander Coolidge , acoolidge@enquirer.com 4:50 p.m. EST November 9, 2016 U.S. President-elect Donald Trump smiles as he arrives to speak at an election night rally, early Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016, in New York. (Photo: AP/Evan Vucci) Donald Trump's election win to become the 45th president of the United States has profound implications for Greater Cincinnati's economy and local companies. Local business observers say Trump has yet to fill in many blanks to reveal his policies on trade, government spending and health care. Trump won in part on a campaign that tapped voters' economic anxieties. Three areas where Trump's policies will have a big impact in the regional economy are trade, the financial sector and health care. The finance and insurance industries represent nearly 21 percent of Greater Cincinnati's $127 billion economy and almost 7 percent of local jobs. Health care accounts for 8 percent of the local economy and 13 percent of jobs. Trade generates nearly 14 percent of the region's economic output and is closely tied to jobs in manufacturing, which account for more than 10 percent of local employment, according to federal labor and economic data. Trade will be especially closely-watched since Trump promised tougher negotiations with other countries and blamed "bad deals," such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, for costing U.S. middle-class manufacturing jobs. Trump singled out Mexico and China for criticism of trade terms – Ohio's No. 2 and No. 3 trading partners that account for nearly 20 percent of $51 billion worth of exports in 2015, according to the Ohio Development Services Agency. "The trade issue is my biggest worry because with protectionism comes a whole series of dominos of repercussions," said Julie Heath, executive director of the University of Cincinnati Economics Center. "Consumers are right away looking at higher prices on imported goods. If we decrease our trade with the rest of the world, we are at risk of a global recession." In contrast with the rest of Ohio, Cincinnati's manufacturing employment has grown 23 percent or by nearly 200,000 jobs since NAFTA took effect in 1994. The entire sector employs about 1.1 million, federal data shows. Cincinnati is Ohio's capital for exports: producing $24.1 billion worth of goods, nearly half of Ohio goods sent overseas. "Trade's a challenge because we're really not sure how much of what he said will be policy and how much was just campaign rhetoric," said Jason Jackman, president and chief investment officer of Johnson Investment Counsel in Monfort Heights. Jackman said if Trump follows through with threats to slap tariffs on goods from China or other countries, they will likely retaliate and a trade war will result. Ultimately, all countries involved will sell fewer goods overseas and their economies will suffer. While Trump bemoaned the country's $19 trillion debt, he's also talked up tax cuts and infrastructure and military spending. Jackman said that bond yields on Wednesday rose, indicating interest rates would rise. That signals the market believes the nation's debt would ultimately increase, which could weigh down on the economy. "The markets are concerned about increased deficit spending," Jackman said. Heath said repealing and replacing Obamacare risked higher cost for states if millions of residents become uninsured again. Fallout in financial markets Though U.S. stock futures threatened to plummet overnight over Donald Trump's surprise victory, markets declined only modestly after opening on Wednesday morning. Dow Jones futures dropped as much as 800 points overnight, pointing to potential losses not seen since the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But by the market close, all the major indices showed gains. The Dow closed up 1.4 percent, the S&P role 1.1 percent, the Nasdaq finished the day up 1.1 percent and the Russell 3000 finished up 3.1 percent. Buy Photo  (Photo: Enquirer file) AK Steel and Fifth Third saw shares jump Wednesday morning as investors bet a Trump administration would take a harder line against steel dumping and relax some regulations that big banks face. AK Steel shares surged nearly 14 percent and Fifth Third jumped 6 percent. Shares of Ashland and Convergys stock were pummeled by more than 5 percent each on poor quarterly performance results. Procter & Gamble stock dropped 1.8 percent on trade concerns. Jeffries analyst Seth Rosenfeld predicted the steel industry would be a unique beneficiary of a more "protectionist" Trump administration. "Falling imports will improve domestic pricing power," Rosenfeld said, adding steel companies, such as AK Steel "should benefit from rising protectionist trade policy." Evercore analyst Glenn Schorr wrote in a note to investors that revising Dodd-Frank financial regulations might be "wishful thinking," but noted a Trump might be a more "friendly" rule-enforcer and his pro-growth philosophy could help the financial sector. "Pro-growth, lower taxes, fiscal stimulus-infrastructure agenda are good for lenders," Schorr wrote, adding that a Federal Reserve decision to raise interest rates was "still in play" and would be "good for banks." 6 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2ffQIz7 TOP VIDEOS Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 Use-of-force expert: 'The actions of Ray Tensing were justified' 0:50 Which stores are opening, closing Thanksgiving Day 0:34 \u0022I can't wait to see Tensing on the stand\u0022 0:55 Cincinnati Police Criminalist: Tensing 'seemed nervous or afraid' 2:59 Crime lab: No evidence on Tensing’s boots that he was dragged 4:07 Alternate juror in Ray Tensing trial has been dismissed 1:24 Born in Cincinnati, celebrated around the world: An anthem that unites us 3:39 Inside Prep Sports 360: Colerain Football prepares for playoffs 5:05 JP Macura looks ahead to the season 2:24

The company's stock fell as much as 15.6 percent to $18.48 on Wednesday, a day after the U.S election, its lowest level since January last year. On a call with analysts, executives attributed the continuing sales weakness to distractions caused by the integration of Procter & Gamble Co's specialty beauty business, which Coty acquired for $12.5 billion. "People are not necessarily fully focused on the business ... they are in transition ... helping out on the integration of the business so those have caused distractions and caused us to lose momentum in the business," Coty Chairman Bart Becht said on the call. The company also said that challenges in the consumer beauty business and the previously-announced sale of 6-8 percent of its product portfolio would hurt second-quarter sales. Becht said the results of the recently concluded U.S. presidential election do not affect the company's plans. SALES LOSE SHINE Fragrance sales fell 9 percent on a like-for-like basis, while color cosmetics fell 6 percent in the first quarter ended Sept. 30. These two segments are its biggest contributors to revenue. "This period of integration for Coty has been met with less than stellar underlying performance and lack of clarity has created anxiety in the stock," Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink said in a note. Coty has inked multiple deals to transform itself into a global beauty products giant, as it reduces its dependence on its struggling fragrance business. After buying P&G's specialty beauty business, the company acquired ghd, a high-end hairstyling appliance brand, from private equity firm Lion Capital LLP for about $522 million. Coty posted no profit during the first quarter ended Sept. 30. In the year-earlier quarter, the company reported a net income of $125.7 million, or 34 cents per share. Net revenue fell to $1.08 billion from $1.11 billion. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $1.14 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of Coty, which owns cosmetics brands like COVERGIRL and Rimmel, were down 13.2 percent in early trading. The stock has fallen as much as 23 percent in the last 12 months.

ALSO READ Market slightly lower in early trade Market hovers in red Market extends losses on negative European cues Market recovers from the day's low Side counters tumble Key benchmark indices continued trading with sharp losses in early afternoon trade. At 12:16 IST, the barometer index, the S&P BSE Sensex, was down 918.81 points or 3.33% at 26,672.33. The Nifty 50 index was down 297.40 points or 3.48% at 8,246.15. The Nifty held above the psychologically important 8,000 mark. The Sensex was trading below the psychologically important 27,000 mark. It had slipped below the 26,000 level at the onset of trading session. Selling was triggered by the Union government's surprise move to withdraw currency notes with a denomination of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500, effective from Tuesday, 8 November 2016, midnight, in an attempt to crack down on black money. Meanwhile, global financial markets sold off as the results of the US election were being called, with Asian stocks and US futures tumbling as Donald Trump pulled ahead in the race for presidency. The United States presidential elections of 2016 were held yesterday, 8 November 2016. The broad market depicted weakness. There were more than 11 losers against every gainer on BSE. 2,321 shares fell and 202 shares rose. A total of 73 shares were unchanged. The BSE Mid-Cap index was currently down 5.02%. The BSE Small-Cap index was currently down 5.91%. The decline in both these indices was higher than the Sensex's decline in percentage terms. In overseas stock markets, Asian stocks slumped in volatile trading as investors await the outcome of the US presidential election, with early results showing Donald Trump capturing several states. In US, stocks finished in positive territory for a second straight day on Tuesday, 8 November 2016, as gains in the consumer goods, utilities and telecoms sectors led shares higher. Trading in US index futures indicated that the Dow Jones Industrial Average could slump 641 points at the opening bell today, 9 November 2016, as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump pulled ahead of Democrat Hillary Clinton in electoral votes. As on 12:15 IST, Hillary Clinton currently has 215 votes, and Donald Trump has 264. Candidates need at least 270 electoral votes to win. Investors around the world are closely watching how the vote tally plays out in America, where Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump vie for the White House. Clinton is viewed more favorably by Wall Street, as she is a well-known political entity who represents the status quo. In contrast, Trump is viewed more warily by investors due to his unpredictable behavior and his negative views on free trade. Investors fear a Trump victory could cause global economic and trade turmoil and years of policy unpredictability, discouraging the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates in December as long expected. Back home, FMCG shares tumbled on concerns that the government's crackdown on black money could hit retail consumption in the near term. Tata Global Beverages (down 8.29%), Marico (down 5.1%), Jyothy Laboratories (down 4.2%), Britannia Industries (down 3.66%), Godrej Consumer Products (down 3.3%), Colgate Palmolive (India) (down 3.09%), Hindustan Unilever (down 2.87%), Dabur India (down 2.54%), Nestle India (down 1.91%), Bajaj Corp (down 1.76%), Procter & Gamble Hygiene & Health Care (down 1.44%) and GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare (down 0.54%), edged lower. Cement shares edged lower. UltraTech Cement (down 6.54%), Ambuja Cements (down 6%) and ACC (down 4.99%), edged lower. Grasim Industries was down 2.81%. Grasim has exposure to cement sector through its holding in UltraTech Cement. Hindalco Industries skidded 6.50% on equity dilution concerns after the company announced that board of directors will consider raising of funds by issue of equity related instruments. Hindalco Industries announced during market hours today, 9 November 2016, that a meeting of the board of directors of the company is scheduled on 12 November 2016 to consider among other items, approval of raising of funds by issue of equity shares, global depository receipts/American depository receipts/, foreign currency convertible bonds/, fully convertible debentures/partly convertible debentures/ preference shares convertible into equity shares, and/or any other financial instruments convertible into equity shares (including warrants, or otherwise, in registered or bearer form) and/or any security convertible into equity shares, combination of any of the aforementioned securities by way of one or more public and/or private offerings, qualified institutions placement and/or on preferential allotment basis or any combination thereof or any other method as may be permitted under applicable law, subject to such approvals as may be required. On the macro front, in a historical move that will add record strength in the fight against corruption, black money, money laundering, terrorism and financing of terrorists as well as counterfeit notes, the Government of India decided that the five hundred and one thousand rupee notes will no longer be legal tender from midnight of 8 November 2016. The Government accepted the recommendations of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to issue two thousand rupee notes and new notes of five hundred rupees will also be placed in circulation. Notes of one hundred, fifty, twenty, ten, five, two and one rupee will remain legal tender and will remain unaffected by the decision. The Prime Minister said the steps taken by the Government would strengthen the hands of the common citizens in the fight against corruption, black money and counterfeit notes. Persons holding old notes of five hundred or one thousand rupees can deposit these notes in bank or post offices from 10 November 2016 onwards till 30 December 2016, the Prime Minister announced yesterday, 8 November 2016, evening.

In overseas stock markets, Asian stocks slumped in volatile trading as investors await the outcome of the US presidential election, with early results showing Donald Trump capturing several states. In US, stocks finished in positive territory for a second straight day on Tuesday, 8 November 2016, as gains in the consumer goods, utilities and telecoms sectors led shares higher. Trading in US index futures indicated that the Dow Jones Industrial Average could slump 641 points at the opening bell today, 9 November 2016, as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump pulled ahead of Democrat Hillary Clinton in electoral votes. As on 12:15 IST, Hillary Clinton currently has 215 votes, and Donald Trump has 264. Candidates need at least 270 electoral votes to win. Investors around the world are closely watching how the vote tally plays out in America, where Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump vie for the White House. Clinton is viewed more favorably by Wall Street, as she is a well-known political entity who represents the status quo. In contrast, Trump is viewed more warily by investors due to his unpredictable behavior and his negative views on free trade. Investors fear a Trump victory could cause global economic and trade turmoil and years of policy unpredictability, discouraging the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates in December as long expected.

The Government accepted the recommendations of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to issue two thousand rupee notes and new notes of five hundred rupees will also be placed in circulation.

At 12:16 IST, the barometer index, the S&P BSE Sensex, was down 918.81 points or 3.33% at 26,672.33. The Nifty 50 index was down 297.40 points or 3.48% at 8,246.15. The Nifty held above the psychologically important 8,000 mark. The Sensex was trading below the psychologically important 27,000 mark. It had slipped below the 26,000 level at the onset of trading session. Selling was triggered by the Union government's surprise move to withdraw currency notes with a denomination of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500, effective from Tuesday, 8 November 2016, midnight, in an attempt to crack down on black money. Meanwhile, global financial markets sold off as the results of the US election were being called, with Asian stocks and US futures tumbling as Donald Trump pulled ahead in the race for presidency.

Credit Bill Rinehart / WVXU Democrat Aftab Pureval did something Tuesday night that seemed impossible for the past few generations of Democrats in Hamilton County – he defeated a Winkler in an election. In this case, it was Tracy Winkler, the Hamilton County clerk of courts. Pureval – a first-time candidate – had 52 percent of the vote to Winkler's 48 percent. "We had  a plan; we stuck to the plan and we ran a grassroots campaign,'' Pureval told WVXU. "In 2016, qualifications and idea won out."  It helped that he outspent his opponent by about five-to-one, but he did it too with sweat and shoe leather. The fact that he had an uncommon, hard-to-pronounce name was a concern for the 34-year-old O'Bryonville resident, when he was mulling over the possibility of running for office in Hamilton County this year, his fellow Democrats say. His name is a source of pride for Pureval. It was given to him by a father from India and a mother who was a Tibetan refugee who fled the Chinese communists. His parents came to this country and decided to settle in, of all places, Beavercreek, Ohio. He became student body president at The Ohio State University (often a door that, once opened, can lead to a career in politics), earned a law degree at the University of Cincinnati, worked for a time with a high-powered law firm in Washington, D.C. , where he did pro bono work representing battered women; and returned to Cincinnati to serve a special assistant U.S. attorney. These days, he is working for Procter & Gamble as the attorney for a billion-dollar brand. Winkler is a potent name in Hamilton County politics, particularly among the throngs of Republican voters in the West Side suburbs. As far as making people familiar with his name, he used a light-hearted approach, doing campaign TV ads with a duck puppet that would periodically squawk "Aftab" – sort of like the Aflac duck in the popular TV ads. Tracy Winkler is part of a passel of Winklers who are serving or have served in elective office – her husband Ralph "Ted" Winkler is the county probate judge; her father-in-law, Ralph Winkler, is retired after serving decades as a judge; her brother-in-law, Robert Winkler, is a common pleas court judge; and her late mother-in-law, Cheryl Winkler, was a Green Township trustee and a state representative. The newspaper City Beat acquired e-mails Winkler's then-chief deputy bailiff, Donald Robinson Jr., sent to employees of the clerk's office telling them to contact the agency's human resources  director if they were willing to distribute campaign yard signs, wear Winkler T-shirts and march in a parade with other Winkler supporters. "There are plenty of events this weekend to get out and support our Keep Tracy Winkler Clerk of Courts campaign,'' Robinson wrote in one of the e-mails City Beat acquired. "As always, post your pictures to all social media." Winkler reprimanded Robinson for the e-mails, which were sent through personal e-mail accounts but during work hours. And she transferred him to a new job, safety and security manager/director, at the same salary he made as chief deputy bailiff for municipal court.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases pr @ satprnews.com Shareablee Measures Social Performance for the Presidential Nominees Prior to the Election NEW YORK, Nov. 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — Shareablee, the leading authority on social media measurement and intelligence has been busy keeping a pulse check on the election and the Republican and Democratic nominees’ social performance. In a review of their Facebook video performance the weekend leading up to the election, November 5 to 6th, both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton seemed to have changed content strategies a bit from pushing platform agendas to go and vote messages. Linked is the recent blog post with data on Facebook performance this past weekend. “The candidates don’t seem to be pushing platform agendas as much as the ‘GO AND VOTE’ message; with the Trump campaign focused on LIVE Facebook video while at rallies and the Clinton Campaign focused on the election journey. It’s a tale of two different methods to get to the same message,” noted Gloria Stitt, Head of Marketing & GM of Media. About Shareablee Shareablee is the first and only industry-level measurement solution for media companies and brands wanting to understand the impact and effectiveness of their cross-platform social media campaigns.

Commenting on the company's performance, Varun Berry, Managing Director of Britannia Industries said the company has witnessed positive momentum in the market growth over the last few months and expects the impact of good monsoon and flow through the 7th pay commission benefits would continue to support this trend. On the commodity front, prices of key raw material have had a high double digit inflation, which is much beyond what the company had originally estimated. While, the company has initiated price increases and accelerated its cost efficiency program, its focus is on remaining competitive in the market place and gain market share to build a sustainable business, Berry said.

Gains were broad, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average reclaiming the key 18,000 level and the S&P 500 snapping its nine-day losing streak, the longest since 1980. The slide had been attributed partly to polls showing a closer contest between Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump. The outcome of United States presidential elections of 2016, which will be held today, 8 November 2016, will have a bearing on global stocks. Presidential election will be held between Democratic party candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican party candidate Donald Trump. The results are expected on the next day of elections.

PREVIOUS:Scott Goodson of StrawberryFrog Takes 10 Brand Lessons from the Donald Trump 'Movement' Revolving Door The Community Promotes 3 to Vice President Roles By Erik Oster on Nov. 8, 2016 - 1:46 PMComment Miami-based cross-cultural agency The Community announced a trio of promotions today. Group creative directors Ricky Vior and Rodrigo Butori and group account director Ana Bermudez will now also be vice presidents, with the former two promoted to executive creative director status. In their new roles, Vior and Butori will continue to work with clients including Verizon, Constellation Brands, Converse, The Kroger Company and BMW and report to The Community co-founder and CCO Joaquin Molla. Bermudez will continue leading the agency’s Verizon and Kroger accounts and reporting to The Community president Luis Montero. The Community was acquired by SapientNitro in early 2014, when it still went by La Comunidad. We first reported on the agency winning Verizon back in December of 2015, though a company spokesperson told us at the time that the telecom company had been working with the shop since last summer. According to several sources, Verizon continued that consolidation earlier this fall by moving multicultural creative on FiOS from Lopez Negrete to The Community. “Our position as a creative agency with a fresh voice in a crowded market place is due in large part to Ricky and Rodrigo and their efforts over the years, and Ana right out of the gate has shown a tremendous ability to partner and strategize with our clients,” Molla said in a statement. “This group of executives are cut from the cloth of curiosity and I have no doubt that they will continue to help us be fearless and focused as we grow and evolve.” Vior has been with The Community since the agency’s founding in 2000. Before joining The Community he served stints at Vegas Olmos Ponce/Lowe and BBDO as a senior/junior art director. Over the course of his career he has worked with clients including Nike, Pepsi, Volkswagen, Fedex, Audi, MTV, VH1, Citibank, and Subway. Butori joined The Community as a group creative director in 2009 following a stint as an associate creative director with David&Goliath. Before that he spent nearly two years in the same role at TBWA\Chiat\Day and earlier in his career held creative roles at Lowe Lintas Brazil, and Young & Rubicam Brazil. He has worked with clients including P&G, Toyota, Ford, Johnson & Johnson, ESPN, Visa, Virgin Mobile and Nissan. Bermudez arrived at The Community last year following serving as group account director for Alma DDB, where she worked on the McDonald’s, Diageo, and McCormick accounts. Previously she worked in account management roles at SapientNitro and Crispin Porter + Bogusky. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

[Photo/China Daily] Retail market analysts predicted that November's big shopping frenzy－the China-inspired Singles' Day－will see a year-on-year sales increase of 40 percent, as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and major international brands use virtual and augmented reality to woo online shoppers. Similar to the UK and US shopping day Black Friday, Chinese online retailers will offer a slew of promotions on Nov 11, and could generate up to US$20 billion sales this year, a 40 percent increase on last year's gross merchandise volume of US$14.3 billion, according to Fung Global Retail & Technology. The 2015 figure represented a year-on-year increase of 54 percent. This year, more British online retailers are joining in with specific offers targeted at China. In terms of online sales volumes, Singles' Day dwarfs Black Friday, the shopping holiday that unofficially marks the start of Christmas shopping in the United Kingdom and United States, falling on Nov 25 this year. Last year, Britons spent US$1.35 billion and Americans spent US$5.8 billion online over Black Friday and its web-based equivalent Cyber Monday. Fung Global said its 2016 forecast was driven by a tailwind from Chinese online shoppers' demand for overseas goods and by expectations for Alibaba's extensive marketing campaign, which this year exploits virtual and augmented reality features. Alibaba will pilot Buy+, a VR headset which will allow shoppers to walk around simulations of bricks-and-mortar stores in locations around the globe, simply nodding to confirm purchase of items. Macy's Inc's flagship store in New York is among participating retailers. British supermarket chain Sainsbury Plc has used a virtual reality promotion tool on Alibaba's online store Tmall in August. Sainsbury's reached top spot on Tmall in terms of orders during a one-and-a-half hour 360-degree live broadcast of its supermarkets in London. The event was the second most popular promotion since Sainsbury's live broadcasted an afternoon tea party on the Queen's birthday. Alibaba has also released a location-based augmented reality Pokemon Go-style mobile app ahead of Singles' Day. The company hopes to drive traffic from online stores to the physical stores of Tmall merchants as users follow an animated mascot on their phones through real city streets. International brands taking part include KFC and Starbucks. A number of British brands will offer discounts specific to Singles' Day this year. Coffee specialists Whittard of Chelsea, Liverpool Football Club and pet food provider Bob Martin will all be offering Singles' Day discounts for the first time, according to a Tmall representative. British brands returning with exclusive Singles' Day promotions include Jellycat, Cambridge Satchel, Myprotein and iconic fashion brand Burberry. Other major international brands joining for the first time include Target, Maserati, Apple, and Guerlain, while Zara, Bose, Samsung, Estee Lauder, L'Oreal P&G, and Unilever are all set to come back. Returning clothing and sportswear brands Uniqlo, Nike, Adidas, and New Balance were among the most popular brands in 2015. International brands are made available through country-specific portals on the Tmall website. Several of Alibaba's competitors are making moves ahead of Singles' Day. Kaola, the e-commerce and cross-border platform of internet service provider NetEase Inc, is partnering with Australian brands UGG and Bellamy's Organic.
