What Companies Have One? A razor-and-blade model can be lucrative. Here are some companies that employ this pricing strategy. Beth McKenna (TMFMcKenna) Jan 13, 2017 at 12:21PM Companies that have a razor-and-blade model use a pricing strategy that involves selling a durable product, or "razor," at a low profit margin (sometimes even giving it away) to help drive sales of the higher-margin proprietary consumable or disposable products, or "blades." The goal of companies that have this type of business model, which reportedly owes its name to Gillette's introduction of safety razors with disposable blades in the early 1900s, is to sell as many "razors" as possible in order to generate an increasing stream of recurring income from "blade" sales over the life of the "razor." Here are some diverse examples of companies that use a razor-and-blade strategy to varying degrees. Company Sector Market Cap The "Razors" The "Blades" Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG)  Consumer goods $221.7 billion Gillette razor handles Disposable razor blades Keurig Green Mountain Consumer goods N/A* Single-serve coffee brewers (and other beverage makers) K-cup coffee pods (and other pods and portion packs of other sizes) 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) Industrials** $1.6 billion 3D printers Print materials  Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) Industrials** $992.6 million 3D printers Print materials Amazon.com  Technology $379.7 billion Kindle e-readers e-books, music, and other offerings for Kindle   Data source: Yahoo! Finance for market caps. Data to Jan. 11. *No longer publicly traded. **Some financial sites classify 3D Systems and Stratasys in the technology sector. Let's examine the first four of the above companies. Procter & Gamble The razor-and-blade model owes its thanks to Gillette for its name. Image source: Getty Images. Global consumer products titan Procter & Gamble uses a razor-and-blade pricing strategy to sell its Gillette-brand razor handles and disposable blades. In 2015, the company had 18 brands that generated at least a billion dollars in sales each, with Gillette being just one of them. So the company is not a pure razor-and-blades play, or even close to one. Keurig Green Mountain  Image source: Keurig Green Mountain.  Keurig Green Mountain, which pioneered and popularized single-serve coffee brewers, adopted a razor-and-blade business model after the company -- then called Green Mountain Coffee Roasters -- acquired single-serve brewer maker Keurig in 2006. Keurig was bought out in early 2016 by an investor group led by privately held JAB Holdings, so its stock is no longer publicly traded.  Keurig's single-serve coffee brewers (and other brewers and beverage makers) are the "razors," and its K-cup coffee pods (and other pods and portion packs of different sizes) are the "blades." Keurig's original pricing policy involved selling its brewers and other beverage makers at only a small markup over its costs in order to entice as many consumers and businesses to buy them; we can assume its current general policy probably remains similar. The company makes most of its money on the recurring revenue stream of consumable pods and other portion packs, which are sold at a higher profit margin. Keurig provides a great example of both how razor-and-blade business models can be extremely lucrative and how they can eventually stumble. Soon after Green Mountain Coffee Roasters fully acquired Keurig in 2006, the company's business soared, along with its stock price. Consumers and businesses loved the convenience of Keurig machines and were locked into buying the company's proprietary K-cups. However, once certain key patents on Keurig's K-cups expired in 2012, competitors entered the market with less expensive coffee pods for the original Keurig brewers, and the company's fortunes ebbed and flowed after that time.  The market sent Keurig shares tumbling in 2011 and 2012 due to concerns about upcoming patent expirations and a couple other issues. Image source: Google Finance.  Keurig took steps to counter the challenges presented by the expiring patents. These included launching other brewers and beverage makers and equipping the Keurig 2.0 brewer with technology to lock out unauthorized coffee pods. These efforts were met with mixed success, however. 3D Systems and Stratasys 3D Systems and Stratasys both have razor-and-blade-like business models in their core products businesses, where the 3D printers that they sell are the "razors" and the print materials they sell are the "blades." These print materials are entirely polymers in Stratasys' case, and primarily polymers in 3D Systems' case. Both leading diversified 3D printing companies also have service businesses that do not use razor-and-blade strategies, so neither is a pure play. Moreover, some might not consider the business models they follow in their products businesses to be pure razor-and-blade models (which is why I used the term "razor-and-blade-like" above). A pure model of this type usually involves selling the "razor" at cost or just a little above cost, or even slightly below cost. 3D Systems and Stratasys price their 3D printers to make solid profits on them. However, they make considerably higher profit margins on the consumable print materials, which are proprietary. Plastic filaments -- the "blades" -- for Stratasys' MakerBot's 3D printers. Image source: Stratasys. The effectiveness of these business models is illustrated by the fact that, while the revenue 3D Systems generated from 3D printer sales declined 6% year over year in the third quarter, the revenue it took in from sales of print materials climbed 9%. In short  Razor-and-blade business models can be lucrative when they're working well, but they can stumble when competitors enter the market with a compelling "razor" that uses less-expensive "blades" -- or, as in Keurig's case, competitors launch "blades" that fit the company's "razor," as often occurs when patents expire.  Beth McKenna has no position in any stocks mentioned.

"The issue that I have is that the bank stocks, if you give them price-to-earnings multiple, they're the cheapest of any group in the stock market. I would sell Procter & Gamble and buy JPMorgan right now, " Cramer said on "Squawk on the Street." Cramer said, "JPMorgan is a totally defensible buy because it doesn't sell at a high multiple to earnings." Bank stocks have rallied in recent months on expectations that President-elect Donald Trump will eliminate regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. On Friday, JPMorgan's quarterly earnings pushed well past analysts' expectations, helped by double-digit growth in deposits and record credit card sales. Its stock price was up 1.4 percent in early trading Friday. Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said in a earnings release there is an opportunity this year for "good, rational and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented."

He added it will be difficult for China's foreign trade to improve in 2017 due to rising costs and other factors. China is the world's largest trading nation.

Nearly one-fifth of the index has been downgraded since Jan 3., including Coca-Cola (KO), Procter & Gamble (PG), Goldman Sachs (GS), Exxon Mobil (XOM), McDonald's (MCD) and Disney (DIS). Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs downgraded staples brands Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble from neutral to sell ratings in two reports, citing a stronger U.S. dollar for one and the price-earnings ratio for the other. Shares of both fell about 1 percent on the day the report came out. Exxon was downgraded to market perform from outperform at Wells Fargo, citing a closed window for an acquisition. McDonald's was downgraded on slowing sales, while Disney was lowered by Pivotal from hold to sell to account for changes in earnings expectations and changing political risks. And Citi downgraded Goldman to sell from neutral in a valuation call after the recent runup for the financials group. Despite the downgrades this month, the Dow has come within a third of a point of hitting the psychological mark of 20,000. Thursday the index closed down 63 points at 19,891, with Goldman contributing the most losses. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Jan 13, 2017 at 12:35PM As a new year starts, investors have likely had time to reflect on their stock market triumphs and failures in 2016. In 2017, many of the old challenges will persist as new ones emerge. Let's take a closer look at five things investors should do this year to stay ahead of the market. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Keep an eye on interest rates U.S. interest rates are widely expected to rise next year, which could impact your portfolio in three big ways. First, dividend stocks could become less attractive than bonds as yields rise -- meaning that income stocks with historically high multiples could tumble. One vulnerable stock is tobacco giant Altria (NYSE:MO), which currently pays a forward yield of 3.6% but trades at 26 times trailing earnings -- which is much higher than its industry average of 21. Second, higher interest rates make it harder for companies to boost their earnings with debt-fueled buybacks. Companies like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) might suffer because they fund their buybacks with debt, but companies like Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) -- which fully funds its buybacks with its free cash flow -- won't be affected. Higher interest rates could also reduce M&A activity due to higher borrowing costs. Lastly, higher interest rates will boost the profitability of banks, because they make savings accounts more attractive while boosting the interest collected on outstanding loans. 2. Mind the U.S. dollar The strong U.S. dollar, which could rise further with higher interest rates, could hurt multinational companies that generate a large percentage of their revenue overseas. This means that many blue chip stocks, like Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, and IBM, could report widening disparities between their constant currency and "as reported" growth. However, a strong U.S. dollar might make "All American" stocks which generate most of their revenue domestically more attractive than their multinational counterparts -- provided that their growth remains steady and valuations stay reasonable. 3. Understand the regulatory pressures In addition to a strong dollar, regulatory pressures both at home and abroad could punish multinational companies. Back at home, President-elect Donald Trump has called out companies like Apple and General Motors (NYSE:GM) for relying too heavily on overseas labor. If these companies are forced to relocate their manufacturing facilities back to the U.S., their operating expenses could surge and hurt their bottom line growth. U.S. companies could also keep struggling in China, where protectionist regulators have slapped American companies like Qualcomm, Microsoft, and General Motors with probes and fines over allegedly anti-competitive practices. Investors should keep a close eye on these moves, but they shouldn't panic and dump these stocks on just a few negative headlines. 4. Don't chase stocks you don't understand These issues and other factors are causing big investors to rotate out of certain sectors and into others. For example, many institutional investors are buying energy stocks due to higher oil prices, and financial stocks in expectation of rising interest rates. They've also been selling some big tech stocks like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet. That herd-like mentality boosted many major energy and financial stocks over the past few months, but investors shouldn't follow that lead if they don't understand those stocks or sectors. 5. Simply do nothing Buying and holding stocks isn't the same as buying and forgetting. Responsible investors should keep up with the latest news about interest rates, the dollar, and regulatory challenges, but they shouldn't sell their stocks based on headlines alone. Instead, the best move you can make in 2017 might be to simply sit still and stop trading your stocks. After all, Peter Lynch famously told investors that a "watched stock never boils." Unless something drastic happens, like the Trump Administration slapping companies with a 45% tax on goods manufactured in China, you may be better off simply holding your existing stocks -- provided that you did your due diligence before buying them.

U.S. companies could also keep struggling in China, where protectionist regulators have slapped American companies like Qualcomm, Microsoft, and General Motors with probes and fines over allegedly anti-competitive practices. Investors should keep a close eye on these moves, but they shouldn't panic and dump these stocks on just a few negative headlines. 4. Don't chase stocks you don't understand These issues and other factors are causing big investors to rotate out of certain sectors and into others. For example, many institutional investors are buying energy stocks due to higher oil prices, and financial stocks in expectation of rising interest rates. They've also been selling some big tech stocks like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet. That herd-like mentality boosted many major energy and financial stocks over the past few months, but investors shouldn't follow that lead if they don't understand those stocks or sectors. 5. Simply do nothing Buying and holding stocks isn't the same as buying and forgetting. Responsible investors should keep up with the latest news about interest rates, the dollar, and regulatory challenges, but they shouldn't sell their stocks based on headlines alone. Instead, the best move you can make in 2017 might be to simply sit still and stop trading your stocks. After all, Peter Lynch famously told investors that a "watched stock never boils." Unless something drastic happens, like the Trump Administration slapping companies with a 45% tax on goods manufactured in China, you may be better off simply holding your existing stocks -- provided that you did your due diligence before buying them.

What Companies Have One? A razor-and-blade model can be lucrative. Here are some companies that employ this pricing strategy. Beth McKenna (TMFMcKenna) Jan 13, 2017 at 12:21PM Companies that have a razor-and-blade model use a pricing strategy that involves selling a durable product, or "razor," at a low profit margin (sometimes even giving it away) to help drive sales of the higher-margin proprietary consumable or disposable products, or "blades." The goal of companies that have this type of business model, which reportedly owes its name to Gillette's introduction of safety razors with disposable blades in the early 1900s, is to sell as many "razors" as possible in order to generate an increasing stream of recurring income from "blade" sales over the life of the "razor." Here are some diverse examples of companies that use a razor-and-blade strategy to varying degrees. Company Sector Market Cap The "Razors" The "Blades" Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG)  Consumer goods $221.7 billion Gillette razor handles Disposable razor blades Keurig Green Mountain Consumer goods N/A* Single-serve coffee brewers (and other beverage makers) K-cup coffee pods (and other pods and portion packs of other sizes) 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) Industrials** $1.6 billion 3D printers Print materials  Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) Industrials** $992.6 million 3D printers Print materials Amazon.com  Technology $379.7 billion Kindle e-readers e-books, music, and other offerings for Kindle   Data source: Yahoo! Finance for market caps. Data to Jan. 11. *No longer publicly traded. **Some financial sites classify 3D Systems and Stratasys in the technology sector. Let's examine the first four of the above companies. Procter & Gamble The razor-and-blade model owes its thanks to Gillette for its name. Image source: Getty Images. Global consumer products titan Procter & Gamble uses a razor-and-blade pricing strategy to sell its Gillette-brand razor handles and disposable blades. In 2015, the company had 18 brands that generated at least a billion dollars in sales each, with Gillette being just one of them. So the company is not a pure razor-and-blades play, or even close to one. Keurig Green Mountain  Image source: Keurig Green Mountain.  Keurig Green Mountain, which pioneered and popularized single-serve coffee brewers, adopted a razor-and-blade business model after the company -- then called Green Mountain Coffee Roasters -- acquired single-serve brewer maker Keurig in 2006. Keurig was bought out in early 2016 by an investor group led by privately held JAB Holdings, so its stock is no longer publicly traded.  Keurig's single-serve coffee brewers (and other brewers and beverage makers) are the "razors," and its K-cup coffee pods (and other pods and portion packs of different sizes) are the "blades." Keurig's original pricing policy involved selling its brewers and other beverage makers at only a small markup over its costs in order to entice as many consumers and businesses to buy them; we can assume its current general policy probably remains similar. The company makes most of its money on the recurring revenue stream of consumable pods and other portion packs, which are sold at a higher profit margin. Keurig provides a great example of both how razor-and-blade business models can be extremely lucrative and how they can eventually stumble. Soon after Green Mountain Coffee Roasters fully acquired Keurig in 2006, the company's business soared, along with its stock price. Consumers and businesses loved the convenience of Keurig machines and were locked into buying the company's proprietary K-cups. However, once certain key patents on Keurig's K-cups expired in 2012, competitors entered the market with less expensive coffee pods for the original Keurig brewers, and the company's fortunes ebbed and flowed after that time.  The market sent Keurig shares tumbling in 2011 and 2012 due to concerns about upcoming patent expirations and a couple other issues. Image source: Google Finance.  Keurig took steps to counter the challenges presented by the expiring patents. These included launching other brewers and beverage makers and equipping the Keurig 2.0 brewer with technology to lock out unauthorized coffee pods. These efforts were met with mixed success, however. 3D Systems and Stratasys 3D Systems and Stratasys both have razor-and-blade-like business models in their core products businesses, where the 3D printers that they sell are the "razors" and the print materials they sell are the "blades." These print materials are entirely polymers in Stratasys' case, and primarily polymers in 3D Systems' case. Both leading diversified 3D printing companies also have service businesses that do not use razor-and-blade strategies, so neither is a pure play. Moreover, some might not consider the business models they follow in their products businesses to be pure razor-and-blade models (which is why I used the term "razor-and-blade-like" above). A pure model of this type usually involves selling the "razor" at cost or just a little above cost, or even slightly below cost. 3D Systems and Stratasys price their 3D printers to make solid profits on them. However, they make considerably higher profit margins on the consumable print materials, which are proprietary. Plastic filaments -- the "blades" -- for Stratasys' MakerBot's 3D printers. Image source: Stratasys. The effectiveness of these business models is illustrated by the fact that, while the revenue 3D Systems generated from 3D printer sales declined 6% year over year in the third quarter, the revenue it took in from sales of print materials climbed 9%. In short  Razor-and-blade business models can be lucrative when they're working well, but they can stumble when competitors enter the market with a compelling "razor" that uses less-expensive "blades" -- or, as in Keurig's case, competitors launch "blades" that fit the company's "razor," as often occurs when patents expire.  Beth McKenna has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Jim Cramer weighed in on the earnings and suggested investors might be wrong in taking advantage of Friday's gains to take some profits off the table. He argued only traders would be looking to take profits on Friday as banks just posted an "unbelievable" quarter. Cramer said that when he looks at The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO) or Clorox Co (NYSE: CLX), he doesn't see the potential for these supposed-growth stocks to raise their dividends and demonstrate strong organic growth - but the same can't be said for bank stocks. Cramer singled out Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC) and suggested that a 100-basis point increase in the Federal Reserve interest rate will by itself result in an incremental $3 billion added to the company's financials. "Do you think Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG) can add on that kind of number?" he hypothetically asked. However, Cramer thinks JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) wasn't just a standout in the bank sector given its record annual profit of almost $25 billion for the year and an ROE of 11 percent. "This was the best quarter ever [for JPMorgan]," Cramer said. "And all I can say is that there is going to be very many better quarters ever."
