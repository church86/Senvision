It is clear to me that Coty has great future potential; the combination of our iconic and emerging brands, energized employees, and the comprehensive strategy we are laying out for the new organization will position us well to become a challenger and leader in beauty and drive sustained profitable growth over time. This is a long term journey and will require time and effort, as we will need to tackle short term challenges like the ones we faced in the first semester, complete the P&G Beauty Business integration and most importantly implement new programs to drive growth and further strengthen our brand portfolio and management capabilities. Starting with the current business situation, let me review the key building blocks to realize Coty`s potential. Consistent with our comments on the last earnings call, Q2 was a challenging quarter. The business was impacted by significantly higher-than-anticipated inventory levels in the market on the acquired P&G Beauty Business, competitive pressure in the Consumer Beauty division and the distraction associated with the merger integration efforts. Fiscal 2017 is a transitional year as previously discussed, and it is Year One in my five-year strategic framework. We believe the combined company net revenue decline in constant currency will slow down for the second half of fiscal 2017, excluding Younique and ghd. While we are still in the midst of the P&G business integration, we have already started to tackle the growth challenges of our business. Specifically, my strategic vision includes strengthening our global brands, shifting more resources to fuel the growth of the brands with higher growth potential, stabilizing the remaining brands, and continuing to expand the geographic reach of our strong brand portfolio. We aim to achieve these objectives through four key pillars. First, we are repositioning some of the brands, in order to reconnect these brands with consumers, building on their already-strong brand equity. Second, we are making significant changes to our innovation and product development process in parts of the organization. Third, we are accelerating our end-to-end digital transformation including e-commerce. And fourth, we are working to significantly revamp our in-store execution. I am convinced these efforts should gradually improve the revenue trends of our business. On the P&G Beauty Business merger, we are reiterating our previously communicated $750 million synergy target by fiscal 2020. The integration is progressing as expected, with no major issues to date. It’s fair to say this is a significant undertaking as we are both integrating and simultaneously reorganizing the entire company to create the organization we need to deliver our mission. On the M&A front, we are continuing to strengthen the Coty portfolio through acquisitions and planned portfolio rationalization. The recent acquisitions of Younique and ghd are highly strategic and expected to be accretive Year One to both revenue growth and adjusted earnings. From a strategic perspective, ghd expands our assortment of premium products for the Salon channel, while the partnership with Younique will combine Younique’s high growth e-commerce platform and social selling direct-to-consumer business model with Coty’s beauty product R&D and innovation know-how as well as extensive manufacturing and supply chain capabilities. On the portfolio rationalization, we have identified the non-core portfolio of brands and are now exploring potential alternatives for these brands including divestitures. In sum, fiscal 2017 remains a transitional year, and, after the first four months as CEO, I remain even more confident that we are setting the stage to realize the enormous potential of Coty as a global leader and challenger in beauty.” Basis of Presentation and Exceptional Items To supplement financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, certain financial information is presented herein using the non-GAAP financial measures described in this section. The term “combined company” describes net revenues of Coty Inc. and the P&G Beauty Business giving effect to the Merger for purposes of the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2015 as if it had occurred on October 1, 2015. Combined company year-over-year and combined company constant currency year-over-year do not include any adjustments related to potential profit improvements, potential cost savings or adjustments to fully conform to the accounting policies of Coty. The term “combined company constant currency” describes the combined company net revenues excluding the effect of currency exchange translations. The term “adjusted” primarily excludes the impact of restructuring and business realignment costs, amortization, costs related to acquisition activities, private company share-based compensation expense, and asset impairment charges to the extent applicable. Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for additional discussion of these measures as well as the definition of free cash flow. Net revenues are reported by segment and geographic region and are discussed below on a reported (GAAP) basis and combined company constant currency basis. Operating income is reported by segment. All changes in margin percentage are described in basis points rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent. Net revenues are presented on an actual, combined company and combined company constant currency. Operating income, net income, operating income margin, gross margin and earnings per diluted share (EPS (diluted)) are presented on a reported (GAAP) basis and an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis. Adjusted EPS (diluted) is a performance measure and should not be construed as a measure of liquidity. Net revenues on a combined company basis, combined company constant currency basis, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted effective tax rate, adjusted net income, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EPS (diluted) and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to „Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for additional discussion of these measures. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in the tables and footnotes at the end of this release. Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 Summary Operating Review Net revenues of $2,296.7 million increased 90% as reported compared to Legacy-Coty net revenues in the prior-year period and decreased 4% at constant currency compared to combined Legacy-Coty and P&G Beauty Business net revenues in the prior-year period. The reported revenue increase reflected a 103% contribution from the acquisitions of P&G Beauty Business, the Brazil Acquisition, and ghd. The 4% constant currency net revenue decline compared to the combined company revenues in the prior-year period reflected a 6% contribution from the Brazil Acquisition and ghd, a 3% negative foreign exchange impact, and a 10% decline in the underlying business. Excluding the positive contribution from ghd and the Brazil Acquisition and the short-term negative transitional impacts, including significant trade inventory build in Q1 in parts of the P&G business, the combined company net revenues declined in the high single digits on a constant currency basis. Gross margin of 61.1% decreased from 61.4% for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, while adjusted gross margin of 63.6% increased from 61.4% for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, reflecting the addition of the higher gross margin P&G Beauty Business. Operating income decreased to $(12.7) million from $152.4 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, as the income contribution from the acquired business was more than offset by increased amortization expense and acquisition related costs. As a percentage of net revenues, operating margin decreased to (0.6)% from 12.6%. Adjusted operating income increased 32% to $308.0 million from $233.4 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, reflecting the profit contribution from the P&G Beauty Business acquisition. As a percentage of net revenues, adjusted operating margin decreased 590 basis points to 13.4% from 19.3% at actual rates, driven by short-term negative transitional impacts and limited profit contribution from the P&G Beauty Business as a result of substantial A&CP pre-commitments which could not be reduced to align with the revenue trends, combined with a depressed dynamic within Consumer Beauty business. Reported effective tax rate was 174.4% compared to 11.8% for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, reflecting a $111.2 million benefit as a result of releasing valuation allowances in the U.S. Adjusted effective tax rate was 8.8% compared to 22.6% for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period. The decline reflected a $39.4 million benefit. Net income decreased to $46.8 million from $89.0 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, reflecting lower operating income and higher interest expense, partially offset by lower tax expense. Adjusted net income increased to $223.3 million from $154.2 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, primarily reflecting higher adjusted operating income and lower tax expenses. As a percentage of net revenues, adjusted net income margin decreased to 9.7% from 12.7% in the prior-year period. Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities in the quarter was $678.4 million, compared to $400.4 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, primarily as a result of improved working capital for the combined company partially offset by lower cash-related net income. Free cash flow was $567.0 million in the quarter compared to $364.7 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, reflecting higher cash from operations partially offset by increased capital expenditure. During the quarter, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share for a total of $93.4 million. Cash and cash equivalents of $939.2 million increased by $566.8 million, total debt of $6,582.4 million increased by $2,412.3 million, with net debt of $5,643.2 million up $1,845.5 million from the balance on June 30, 2016.

Luxury net revenues decreased 4% at constant currency compared to combined Legacy-Coty and P&G Beauty Business net revenues in the prior-year period, impacted by our continued wholesale distribution reduction, which is a positive for the health of the business, and difficult innovation comparisons versus the prior year. Growth in brands including Hugo Boss, Davidoff, and Chloe were offset by declines in Calvin Klein and Marc Jacobs. Adjusted operating income for Luxury decreased 6% to $97.5 million from $103.2 million in the prior-year period, resulting in a 11.7% adjusted operating income margin, a decrease of 710 basis points versus Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period. Consumer Beauty Consumer Beauty net revenues of $1,001.7 million increased 68% as reported compared to Legacy-Coty net revenues in the prior-year period reflecting the contribution from the acquired P&G Beauty Business and the Brazil Acquisition. Consumer Beauty net revenues decreased 11% at constant currency compared to combined Legacy-Coty and P&G Beauty Business net revenues in the prior-year period. This decline reflected a high single digit percentage negative impact from the short-term transitional impacts, largely offset by the revenue contribution from the Brazil Acquisition. The in-market performance sell-through of the division was better than the sell-in, with a high single digit decline. Adjusted operating income for Consumer Beauty increased 1% to $110.5 million from $109.2 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, resulting in an 11.0% adjusted operating income margin versus 18.3% for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period. Professional Professional Beauty net revenues of $460.0 million increased 560% as reported compared to Legacy-Coty net revenues in the prior-year period reflecting the contribution from the acquired P&G Beauty Business and the ghd acquisition, partially offset by declines in OPI. Professional Beauty net revenues increased 14% at constant currency compared to combined Legacy-Coty and P&G Beauty Business net revenues in the prior-year period, reflecting growth in professional hair as well as revenue contribution from ghd, which was acquired on November 21, 2016. Adjusted operating income for Professional increased to $100.0 million from $21.0 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, resulting in a 21.7% adjusted operating income margin versus 32.4% for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period.

Europe Reported net revenues increased 94% compared to Legacy-Coty net revenues in the prior-year period and decreased 1% at constant currency compared to combined Coty and P&G Beauty Business net revenues in the prior-year period driven by primarily the U.K. and Germany. ALMEA Reported net revenues increased 102% compared to Legacy-Coty net revenues in the prior-year period and increased 1% at constant currency compared to combined Coty and P&G Beauty Business net revenues in the prior-year period driven by Brazil, the Middle East and Australia. Noteworthy Company Developments Other noteworthy company developments include: On November 21, 2016, Coty announced the completion of the acquisition of ghd, a global premium brand in high-end hair styling appliances, further strengthening Coty’s worldwide leading position in professional hair care. On December 9, 2016, Coty announced that its Board of Directors approved a transition to a quarterly dividend payout schedule, and approved Coty’s first quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share of common stock. Today, February 9, 2017, Coty announced that its Board of Directors have approved its second quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share of common stock. The dividend represents an expected total dividend of $0.50 per share of common stock per annum, which is an 82% increase in Coty’s per annum dividend. On February 1, 2017, Coty entered into a partnership with the Founders of Younique, a leading online peer-to-peer social selling platform in beauty. Under the agreement, Coty acquired 60% of Younique with the Founders owning the remaining 40%. Younique’s highly scalable technology platform is built for mobile-first e-commerce and seamless global expansion, with approximately 200,000 active presenters and millions of customers in 10 countries. Younique expects to generate approximately $400 million in net revenues in 2016, with an adjusted EBITDA margin above 25%. Outlook Coty only provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis and does not provide reconciliations of such forward-looking non-GAAP measures to GAAP due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation, including adjustments that could be made for restructuring, integration and acquisition-related expenses, amortization expenses, adjustments to inventory, and other charges reflected in our reconciliation of historic numbers, the amount of which, based on historical experience, could be significant. The Company expects the combined company net revenue decline in constant currency to slow down for the second half of fiscal 2017, excluding Younique and ghd. Coty continues to target the total four-year synergies and working capital benefits of $750 million and $500 million, respectively, with no change to the operating costs to realize both. The Company is refining the phasing of the targeted $750M in synergies in order to take into account the business dynamics and to reflect the fiscal year P&L impact. Coty now expects to cumulatively generate approximately 20% of the net $750M synergies through FY17, approximately 50% through FY18, approximately 80% through FY19, and the full $750M through FY20, with the focus on having the right infrastructure in place to support long-term growth.

All forward-looking statements made in this release are qualified by these cautionary statements. These forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this release, and the Company does not undertake any obligation, other than as may be required by law, to update or revise any forward-looking or cautionary statements to reflect changes in assumptions, the occurrence of events, unanticipated or otherwise, or changes in future operating results over time or otherwise. Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data. Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company operates on a global basis, with the majority of net revenues generated outside of the U.S. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect results of operations. Therefore, to supplement financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, certain financial information is presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations to provide a framework for assessing how the underlying businesses performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations (“constant currency”). Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period, with the current period’s results calculated at the prior-year period’s rates. The Company calculates constant currency information by translating current and prior-period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. dollars into U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates. The constant currency calculations do not adjust for the impact of revaluing specific transactions denominated in a currency that is different to the functional currency of that entity when exchange rates fluctuate. The constant currency information presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company discloses the following constant currency financial measures: combined company net revenues and adjusted operating income. The Company presents year-over-year comparisons on a combined company and combined company constant currency basis. The Company believes that combined company year-over-year and combined company constant currency year-over-year better enable management and investors to analyze and compare the Company’s net revenues performance from period to period, as the total business and individual divisions are being managed on a combined company basis. In the periods described in this release, combined company year-over-year and combined company constant currency year-over-year give effect to the completion of the Merger for purposes of the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2015 as if it has been completed on October 1, 2015. Combined company growth and combined company constant currency growth do not include any adjustments related to potential profit improvements, potential cost savings or adjustments to fully conform to the accounting policies of Coty. For reconciliation of combined company year-over-year and combined company constant currency year-over-year, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Net Revenues to Combined Company Net Revenues.” For a reconciliation of the Company’s combined company year-over-year and combined company constant currency year-over-year by segment and geographic region, see the tables entitled “Net Revenues and Adjusted Operating Income by Segment” and “Net Revenues by Geographic Regions.” The Company presents operating income, operating income margin, gross margin, effective tax rate, net income, net income margin, net revenues and EPS (diluted) on a non-GAAP basis and specifies that these measures are non-GAAP by using the term “adjusted”. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures better enable management and investors to analyze and compare operating performance from period to period. In calculating adjusted operating income, operating income margin, gross margin, effective tax rate, net income, net income margin and EPS (diluted), the Company excludes following items: Costs related to acquisition activities: The Company excludes acquisition-related costs and acquisition accounting impacts such as those related to transaction costs and costs associated with the revaluation of acquired inventory in connection with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction. The nature and amount of such costs vary significantly based on the size and timing of the acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Also, the size, complexity and/or volume of past acquisitions, which often drives the magnitude of such expenses, may not be indicative of the size, complexity and/or volume of any future acquisitions. Restructuring and other business realignment costs: The Company excludes costs associated with restructuring and business structure realignment programs to allow for comparable financial results to historical operations and forward-looking guidance. In addition, the nature and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs. By excluding the above referenced expenses from the non-GAAP financial measures, management is able to evaluate the Company’s ability to utilize existing assets and estimate their long-term value. Furthermore, management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of the Company’s operating performance. Amortization expense: The Company excludes the impact of amortization of finite-lived intangible assets, as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of the Company’s operating performance. Although the Company excludes amortization of intangible assets from the non-GAAP expenses, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets. Asset impairment charges: The Company excludes the impact of asset impairments as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of the Company’s operating performance. Share-based compensation adjustment: The Company excludes the impact of the fiscal 2013 accounting modification from liability plan to equity plan accounting for the share-based compensation plans as well as other share-based compensation transactions that are not reflective of the ongoing and planned pattern of recognition for such expense. Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” contained in the respective forms filed with the SEC for a full discussion of the share-based compensation adjustment. Interest and other (income) expense: The Company excludes foreign currency impacts associated with acquisition-related and debt financing related forward contracts as the nature and amount of such charges are not consistent and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of such transactions. Loss on early extinguishment of debt: The Company excludes the loss on extinguishment of debt as this represents a non-cash charge, and the amount and frequency of such charges is not consistent and is significantly impacted by the timing and size of debt financing transactions. Tax: This adjustment represents the impact of the tax effect of the pretax items excluded from Adjusted net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments are based on the tax rates related to the jurisdiction in which the adjusted items are received or incurred. The Company has provided a quantitative reconciliation of the difference between the non-GAAP financial measures and the financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin to gross margin, adjusted EPS (diluted) to EPS (diluted), and adjusted net revenues to net revenues, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported to Adjusted Results for the Consolidated Statements of Operations.” For a reconciliation of adjusted operating income to operating income and adjusted operating income margin to operating income margin, see the tables entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Operating Income to Adjusted Operating Income” and „Reconciliation of Reported Operating Income to Adjusted Operating Income by Segment.” For a reconciliation of adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted cash tax rate to effective tax rate, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Income Before Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates to Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes, Effective Tax Rates and Cash Tax Rates.” For a reconciliation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income margin to net income, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Net Income to Adjusted Net Income.” The Company also presents free cash flow. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures. Free cash flow excludes cash used for private company stock option exercises and cash used for acquisitions. Management believes that free cash flow is useful for investors because it provides them with an important perspective on the cash available for debt repayment and other strategic measures, after making necessary capital investments in property and equipment to support the Company’s ongoing business operations, and provides them with the same measures that management uses as the basis for making resource allocation decisions. For a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow.” These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. – Tables Follow –   COTY INC. & SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (Unaudited)     Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, (in millions, except per share data) 2016   2015 2016   2015 Net revenues $   2,296.7 $   1,210.5 $   3,376.9 $   2,322.8 Cost of sales 892.3   467.7   1,337.1   911.4   as % of Net revenues 38.9 % 38.6 % 39.6 % 39.2 % Gross profit 1,404.4 742.8 2,039.8 1,411.4 Gross margin 61.1 % 61.4 % 60.4 % 60.8 %   Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,170.2 515.4 1,649.1 999.7 as % of Net revenues 51.0 % 42.6 % 48.8 % 43.0 % Amortization expense 95.2 18.9 116.4 38.1 Restructuring costs 15.8 10.6 23.2 72.7 Acquisition-related costs 135.9 45.5 217.4 61.3 Asset impairment charges —   —   —   5.5   Operating (loss) income (12.7 ) 152.4 33.7 234.1 as % of Net revenues (0.6 %) 12.6 % 1.0 % 10.1 % Interest expense, net 57.9 14.6 98.3 30.6 Loss on extinguishment of debt — 3.1 — 3.1 Other (income) expense, net (0.6 ) 24.1   0.7   23.8   (Loss) income before income taxes (70.0 ) 110.6 (65.3 ) 176.6 as % of Net revenues (3.0 %) 9.1 % (1.9 %) 7.6 % (Benefit) provision for income taxes (122.1 ) 13.0   (127.2 ) (54.1 ) Net income 52.1 97.6 61.9 230.7 as % of Net revenues 2.3 % 8.1 % 1.8 % 9.9 % Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 2.5 5.3 10.7 9.7 Net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests 2.8   3.3   4.4   6.3   Net income attributable to Coty Inc. $   46.8   $   89.0   $   46.8   $   214.7   as % of Net revenues 2.0 % 7.4 % 1.4 % 9.2 % Net income attributable to Coty Inc. per common share: Basic $ 0.06 $ 0.26 $ 0.09 $ 0.61 Diluted $ 0.06 $ 0.25 $ 0.09 $ 0.59 Weighted-average common shares outstanding: Basic 746.6 345.0 539.8 352.5 Diluted 752.4 354.3 545.8 362.0   Cash dividend declared per common share $ 0.125 $ — $ 0.400 $ 0.250     COTY INC.

Mohamed Samir, IMEA President for P&G, explained that implementation of this commitment will include four key areas for 2017, which will be undertaken in partnership with UN Women and other female-empowerment organizations. “P&G has been championing the cause of gender equality both inside and outside of P&G, leveraging the strengths of our business and operations, our scale and our advertising voice to address gender bias and enable education for girls and women’s economic empowerment,” explained Samir. These four areas include: Advertisement 1. P&G will expand its supplier development and sourcing from women-owned business in our supply chains across the world, including the Indian subcontinent, Middle East and Africa. 2. P&G will continue to reveal gender bias and spark conversations through P&G brand advertising campaigns and encourage the wider advertising industry to do the same. 3. P&G, working with our NGO partners on the ground, will empower women & girls impacted by the Syrian refugee crisis to realize their potential. 4. P&G will extend our programs to keep girls in school in India, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Tanzania.

The UAE Gender Balance Council is playing an important role in driving further progress in the field of gender balance and contributing to the development of society. We are also proud that Procter & Gamble has answered our call for action to promote gender equality around the world and particularly in this region, through their strong commitments for 2017.” Gender Equality is a priority focus area of P&G’s Citizenship activities.

The news was made public by Mr. Mohamed Sultan, Vice President, Arabian Peninsula, Procter & Gamble during a meeting of the United Nations Secretary-General’s High Level Panel on Women’s Economic Empowerment (‘HLP’), which was held for the first time in the Middle East region and hosted by the UAE Gender Balance Council. P&G’s commitment to gender equality is in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #5 – to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls globally. Mohamed Samir, IMEA President for P&G, explained that implementation of this commitment will include four key areas for 2017, which will be undertaken in partnership with UN Women and other female-empowerment organizations. “P&G has been championing the cause of gender equality both inside and outside of P&G, leveraging the strengths of our business and operations, our scale and our advertising voice to address gender bias and enable education for girls and women’s economic empowerment,” explained Samir. These four areas include: Advertisement 1. P&G will expand its supplier development and sourcing from women-owned business in our supply chains across the world, including the Indian subcontinent, Middle East and Africa. 2. P&G will continue to reveal gender bias and spark conversations through P&G brand advertising campaigns and encourage the wider advertising industry to do the same. 3. P&G, working with our NGO partners on the ground, will empower women & girls impacted by the Syrian refugee crisis to realize their potential. 4. P&G will extend our programs to keep girls in school in India, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Tanzania. Dr. Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, Executive Director of UN Women, stated “I commend P&G on their excellent initiative and call on all companies to equal or better implementation of the recommendations arising from the High Level Panel, in the interests of achieving women’s economic empowerment.” At the meeting of the UN Secretary-General’s HLP, hosted by UAE Gender Balance Council, Her Excellency, the Vice President of the UAE Gender Balance Council, Mona Al Marri, spoke of the impact that female empowerment has had on the UAE and the importance of positive action by all stakeholders including the private sector. “Women’s empowerment is at the heart of the UAE’s national strategy, and the country’s leadership wants to see the UAE at the forefront of women’s empowerment. The UAE Gender Balance Council is playing an important role in driving further progress in the field of gender balance and contributing to the development of society. We are also proud that Procter & Gamble has answered our call for action to promote gender equality around the world and particularly in this region, through their strong commitments for 2017.” Gender Equality is a priority focus area of P&G’s Citizenship activities. P&G has been steadily working to improve gender equality by leveraging its unique strengths. Some of P&G’s achievements globally and in this region include: Business & Operations P&G hires 50% women into entry level management roles and they get promoted into next assignments at the same progression as men. P&G was the first Consumer Goods Company with a license to employ women in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and now employs 15% women managers in KSA across all commercial disciplines including Finance, HR, Sales & Marketing In the US, P&G has integrated women-owned businesses into our sourcing supply chain.  In P&G’s last fiscal year, the company spent 1.1 BN$ with women-owned businesses and importantly the majority of this spend is direct.   Scale P&G and our Always brand has a 30-year history of providing puberty and hygiene education and is reaching over 17 million girls across the world each year.

If you bought P&G anytime in the last two years, selling now means getting out exactly where you got in -- costing you time, if not money. TheStreet Staff Feb 8, 2017 6:01 AM EST They say a rising tide lifts all boats. But the post-election rally seems to have missed Procter & Gamble (PG) . The consumer giant ticked up just 1% in the days after the election as the Dow roared past 20,000. Even with that, nearly half of Wall Street experts say P&G is a buy. The other half says it is a hold. Only Goldman Sachs is slapping P&G stocks with a sell rating.  Of course, if you bought P&G anytime in the last two years, selling now means getting out exactly where you got in, costing you time, if not money. Think this is the time to buy? Just know that P&G is several multiples more expensive than its consumer-staple peers. Add to that downside risk of 9%, Goldman said.  This article was written by a staff member of TheStreet.

It is clear to me that Coty has great future potential; the combination of our iconic and emerging brands, energized employees, and the comprehensive strategy we are laying out for the new organization will position us well to become a challenger and leader in beauty and drive sustained profitable growth over time. This is a long term journey and will require time and effort, as we will need to tackle short term challenges like the ones we faced in the first semester, complete the P&G Beauty Business integration and most importantly implement new programs to drive growth and further strengthen our brand portfolio and management capabilities. Starting with the current business situation, let me review the key building blocks to realize Coty`s potential. Consistent with our comments on the last earnings call, Q2 was a challenging quarter. The business was impacted by significantly higher-than-anticipated inventory levels in the market on the acquired P&G Beauty Business, competitive pressure in the Consumer Beauty division and the distraction associated with the merger integration efforts. Fiscal 2017 is a transitional year as previously discussed, and it is Year One in my five-year strategic framework. We believe the combined company net revenue decline in constant currency will slow down for the second half of fiscal 2017, excluding Younique and ghd. While we are still in the midst of the P&G business integration, we have already started to tackle the growth challenges of our business. Specifically, my strategic vision includes strengthening our global brands, shifting more resources to fuel the growth of the brands with higher growth potential, stabilizing the remaining brands, and continuing to expand the geographic reach of our strong brand portfolio. We aim to achieve these objectives through four key pillars. First, we are repositioning some of the brands, in order to reconnect these brands with consumers, building on their already-strong brand equity. Second, we are making significant changes to our innovation and product development process in parts of the organization. Third, we are accelerating our end-to-end digital transformation including e-commerce. And fourth, we are working to significantly revamp our in-store execution. I am convinced these efforts should gradually improve the revenue trends of our business. On the P&G Beauty Business merger, we are reiterating our previously communicated $750 million synergy target by fiscal 2020. The integration is progressing as expected, with no major issues to date. It's fair to say this is a significant undertaking as we are both integrating and simultaneously reorganizing the entire company to create the organization we need to deliver our mission. On the M&A front, we are continuing to strengthen the Coty portfolio through acquisitions and planned portfolio rationalization. The recent acquisitions of Younique and ghd are highly strategic and expected to be accretive Year One to both revenue growth and adjusted earnings. From a strategic perspective, ghd expands our assortment of premium products for the Salon channel, while the partnership with Younique will combine Younique’s high growth e-commerce platform and social selling direct-to-consumer business model with Coty’s beauty product R&D and innovation know-how as well as extensive manufacturing and supply chain capabilities. On the portfolio rationalization, we have identified the non-core portfolio of brands and are now exploring potential alternatives for these brands including divestitures. In sum, fiscal 2017 remains a transitional year, and, after the first four months as CEO, I remain even more confident that we are setting the stage to realize the enormous potential of Coty as a global leader and challenger in beauty.” Basis of Presentation and Exceptional Items To supplement financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, certain financial information is presented herein using the non-GAAP financial measures described in this section. The term “combined company” describes net revenues of Coty Inc. and the P&G Beauty Business giving effect to the Merger for purposes of the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2015 as if it had occurred on October 1, 2015. Combined company year-over-year and combined company constant currency year-over-year do not include any adjustments related to potential profit improvements, potential cost savings or adjustments to fully conform to the accounting policies of Coty. The term “combined company constant currency” describes the combined company net revenues excluding the effect of currency exchange translations. The term “adjusted” primarily excludes the impact of restructuring and business realignment costs, amortization, costs related to acquisition activities, private company share-based compensation expense, and asset impairment charges to the extent applicable. Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for additional discussion of these measures as well as the definition of free cash flow. Net revenues are reported by segment and geographic region and are discussed below on a reported (GAAP) basis and combined company constant currency basis. Operating income is reported by segment. All changes in margin percentage are described in basis points rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent. Net revenues are presented on an actual, combined company and combined company constant currency. Operating income, net income, operating income margin, gross margin and earnings per diluted share (EPS (diluted)) are presented on a reported (GAAP) basis and an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis. Adjusted EPS (diluted) is a performance measure and should not be construed as a measure of liquidity. Net revenues on a combined company basis, combined company constant currency basis, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted effective tax rate, adjusted net income, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EPS (diluted) and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for additional discussion of these measures. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in the tables and footnotes at the end of this release. Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 Summary Operating Review Net revenues of $2,296.7 million increased 90% as reported compared to Legacy-Coty net revenues in the prior-year period and decreased 4% at constant currency compared to combined Legacy-Coty and P&G Beauty Business net revenues in the prior-year period. The reported revenue increase reflected a 103% contribution from the acquisitions of P&G Beauty Business, the Brazil Acquisition, and ghd. The 4% constant currency net revenue decline compared to the combined company revenues in the prior-year period reflected a 6% contribution from the Brazil Acquisition and ghd, a 3% negative foreign exchange impact, and a 10% decline in the underlying business. Excluding the positive contribution from ghd and the Brazil Acquisition and the short-term negative transitional impacts, including significant trade inventory build in Q1 in parts of the P&G business, the combined company net revenues declined in the high single digits on a constant currency basis. Gross margin of 61.1% decreased from 61.4% for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, while adjusted gross margin of 63.6% increased from 61.4% for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, reflecting the addition of the higher gross margin P&G Beauty Business. Operating income decreased to $(12.7) million from $152.4 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, as the income contribution from the acquired business was more than offset by increased amortization expense and acquisition related costs. As a percentage of net revenues, operating margin decreased to (0.6)% from 12.6%. Adjusted operating income increased 32% to $308.0 million from $233.4 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, reflecting the profit contribution from the P&G Beauty Business acquisition. As a percentage of net revenues, adjusted operating margin decreased 590 basis points to 13.4% from 19.3% at actual rates, driven by short-term negative transitional impacts and limited profit contribution from the P&G Beauty Business as a result of substantial A&CP pre-commitments which could not be reduced to align with the revenue trends, combined with a depressed dynamic within Consumer Beauty business. Reported effective tax rate was 174.4% compared to 11.8% for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, reflecting a $111.2 million benefit as a result of releasing valuation allowances in the U.S. Adjusted effective tax rate was 8.8% compared to 22.6% for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period. The decline reflected a $39.4 million benefit. Net income decreased to $46.8 million from $89.0 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, reflecting lower operating income and higher interest expense, partially offset by lower tax expense. Adjusted net income increased to $223.3 million from $154.2 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, primarily reflecting higher adjusted operating income and lower tax expenses. As a percentage of net revenues, adjusted net income margin decreased to 9.7% from 12.7% in the prior-year period. Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities in the quarter was $678.4 million, compared to $400.4 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, primarily as a result of improved working capital for the combined company partially offset by lower cash-related net income. Free cash flow was $567.0 million in the quarter compared to $364.7 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, reflecting higher cash from operations partially offset by increased capital expenditure. During the quarter, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share for a total of $93.4 million. Cash and cash equivalents of $939.2 million increased by $566.8 million, total debt of $6,582.4 million increased by $2,412.3 million, with net debt of $5,643.2 million up $1,845.5 million from the balance on June 30, 2016.

Luxury net revenues decreased 4% at constant currency compared to combined Legacy-Coty and P&G Beauty Business net revenues in the prior-year period, impacted by our continued wholesale distribution reduction, which is a positive for the health of the business, and difficult innovation comparisons versus the prior year. Growth in brands including Hugo Boss, Davidoff, and Chloe were offset by declines in Calvin Klein and Marc Jacobs. Adjusted operating income for Luxury decreased 6% to $97.5 million from $103.2 million in the prior-year period, resulting in a 11.7% adjusted operating income margin, a decrease of 710 basis points versus Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period. Consumer Beauty Consumer Beauty net revenues of $1,001.7 million increased 68% as reported compared to Legacy-Coty net revenues in the prior-year period reflecting the contribution from the acquired P&G Beauty Business and the Brazil Acquisition. Consumer Beauty net revenues decreased 11% at constant currency compared to combined Legacy-Coty and P&G Beauty Business net revenues in the prior-year period. This decline reflected a high single digit percentage negative impact from the short-term transitional impacts, largely offset by the revenue contribution from the Brazil Acquisition. The in-market performance sell-through of the division was better than the sell-in, with a high single digit decline. Adjusted operating income for Consumer Beauty increased 1% to $110.5 million from $109.2 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, resulting in an 11.0% adjusted operating income margin versus 18.3% for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period. Professional Professional Beauty net revenues of $460.0 million increased 560% as reported compared to Legacy-Coty net revenues in the prior-year period reflecting the contribution from the acquired P&G Beauty Business and the ghd acquisition, partially offset by declines in OPI. Professional Beauty net revenues increased 14% at constant currency compared to combined Legacy-Coty and P&G Beauty Business net revenues in the prior-year period, reflecting growth in professional hair as well as revenue contribution from ghd, which was acquired on November 21, 2016. Adjusted operating income for Professional increased to $100.0 million from $21.0 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period, resulting in a 21.7% adjusted operating income margin versus 32.4% for Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period.

Noteworthy Company Developments Other noteworthy company developments include: On November 21, 2016, Coty announced the completion of the acquisition of ghd, a global premium brand in high-end hair styling appliances, further strengthening Coty’s worldwide leading position in professional hair care. On December 9, 2016, Coty announced that its Board of Directors approved a transition to a quarterly dividend payout schedule, and approved Coty’s first quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share of common stock. Today, February 9, 2017, Coty announced that its Board of Directors have approved its second quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share of common stock. The dividend represents an expected total dividend of $0.50 per share of common stock per annum, which is an 82% increase in Coty’s per annum dividend. On February 1, 2017, Coty entered into a partnership with the Founders of Younique, a leading online peer-to-peer social selling platform in beauty. Under the agreement, Coty acquired 60% of Younique with the Founders owning the remaining 40%. Younique’s highly scalable technology platform is built for mobile-first e-commerce and seamless global expansion, with approximately 200,000 active presenters and millions of customers in 10 countries. Younique expects to generate approximately $400 million in net revenues in 2016, with an adjusted EBITDA margin above 25%. Outlook Coty only provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis and does not provide reconciliations of such forward-looking non-GAAP measures to GAAP due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation, including adjustments that could be made for restructuring, integration and acquisition-related expenses, amortization expenses, adjustments to inventory, and other charges reflected in our reconciliation of historic numbers, the amount of which, based on historical experience, could be significant. The Company expects the combined company net revenue decline in constant currency to slow down for the second half of fiscal 2017, excluding Younique and ghd. Coty continues to target the total four-year synergies and working capital benefits of $750 million and $500 million, respectively, with no change to the operating costs to realize both. The Company is refining the phasing of the targeted $750M in synergies in order to take into account the business dynamics and to reflect the fiscal year P&L impact. Coty now expects to cumulatively generate approximately 20% of the net $750M synergies through FY17, approximately 50% through FY18, approximately 80% through FY19, and the full $750M through FY20, with the focus on having the right infrastructure in place to support long-term growth.

All forward-looking statements made in this release are qualified by these cautionary statements. These forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this release, and the Company does not undertake any obligation, other than as may be required by law, to update or revise any forward-looking or cautionary statements to reflect changes in assumptions, the occurrence of events, unanticipated or otherwise, or changes in future operating results over time or otherwise. Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data. Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company operates on a global basis, with the majority of net revenues generated outside of the U.S. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect results of operations. Therefore, to supplement financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, certain financial information is presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations to provide a framework for assessing how the underlying businesses performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations (“constant currency”). Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period, with the current period’s results calculated at the prior-year period’s rates. The Company calculates constant currency information by translating current and prior-period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. dollars into U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates. The constant currency calculations do not adjust for the impact of revaluing specific transactions denominated in a currency that is different to the functional currency of that entity when exchange rates fluctuate. The constant currency information presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company discloses the following constant currency financial measures: combined company net revenues and adjusted operating income. The Company presents year-over-year comparisons on a combined company and combined company constant currency basis. The Company believes that combined company year-over-year and combined company constant currency year-over-year better enable management and investors to analyze and compare the Company's net revenues performance from period to period, as the total business and individual divisions are being managed on a combined company basis. In the periods described in this release, combined company year-over-year and combined company constant currency year-over-year give effect to the completion of the Merger for purposes of the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2015 as if it has been completed on October 1, 2015. Combined company growth and combined company constant currency growth do not include any adjustments related to potential profit improvements, potential cost savings or adjustments to fully conform to the accounting policies of Coty. For reconciliation of combined company year-over-year and combined company constant currency year-over-year, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Net Revenues to Combined Company Net Revenues.” For a reconciliation of the Company's combined company year-over-year and combined company constant currency year-over-year by segment and geographic region, see the tables entitled “Net Revenues and Adjusted Operating Income by Segment” and “Net Revenues by Geographic Regions." The Company presents operating income, operating income margin, gross margin, effective tax rate, net income, net income margin, net revenues and EPS (diluted) on a non-GAAP basis and specifies that these measures are non-GAAP by using the term “adjusted”. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures better enable management and investors to analyze and compare operating performance from period to period. In calculating adjusted operating income, operating income margin, gross margin, effective tax rate, net income, net income margin and EPS (diluted), the Company excludes following items: Costs related to acquisition activities: The Company excludes acquisition-related costs and acquisition accounting impacts such as those related to transaction costs and costs associated with the revaluation of acquired inventory in connection with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction. The nature and amount of such costs vary significantly based on the size and timing of the acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Also, the size, complexity and/or volume of past acquisitions, which often drives the magnitude of such expenses, may not be indicative of the size, complexity and/or volume of any future acquisitions. Restructuring and other business realignment costs: The Company excludes costs associated with restructuring and business structure realignment programs to allow for comparable financial results to historical operations and forward-looking guidance. In addition, the nature and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs. By excluding the above referenced expenses from the non-GAAP financial measures, management is able to evaluate the Company’s ability to utilize existing assets and estimate their long-term value. Furthermore, management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of the Company’s operating performance. Amortization expense: The Company excludes the impact of amortization of finite-lived intangible assets, as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of the Company’s operating performance. Although the Company excludes amortization of intangible assets from the non-GAAP expenses, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets. Asset impairment charges: The Company excludes the impact of asset impairments as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Management believes that the adjustment of these items supplement the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of the Company’s operating performance. Share-based compensation adjustment: The Company excludes the impact of the fiscal 2013 accounting modification from liability plan to equity plan accounting for the share-based compensation plans as well as other share-based compensation transactions that are not reflective of the ongoing and planned pattern of recognition for such expense. Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” contained in the respective forms filed with the SEC for a full discussion of the share-based compensation adjustment. Interest and other (income) expense: The Company excludes foreign currency impacts associated with acquisition-related and debt financing related forward contracts as the nature and amount of such charges are not consistent and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of such transactions. Loss on early extinguishment of debt: The Company excludes the loss on extinguishment of debt as this represents a non-cash charge, and the amount and frequency of such charges is not consistent and is significantly impacted by the timing and size of debt financing transactions. Tax: This adjustment represents the impact of the tax effect of the pretax items excluded from Adjusted net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments are based on the tax rates related to the jurisdiction in which the adjusted items are received or incurred. The Company has provided a quantitative reconciliation of the difference between the non-GAAP financial measures and the financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin to gross margin, adjusted EPS (diluted) to EPS (diluted), and adjusted net revenues to net revenues, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported to Adjusted Results for the Consolidated Statements of Operations.” For a reconciliation of adjusted operating income to operating income and adjusted operating income margin to operating income margin, see the tables entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Operating Income to Adjusted Operating Income” and "Reconciliation of Reported Operating Income to Adjusted Operating Income by Segment." For a reconciliation of adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted cash tax rate to effective tax rate, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Income Before Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates to Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes, Effective Tax Rates and Cash Tax Rates.” For a reconciliation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income margin to net income, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Net Income to Adjusted Net Income.” The Company also presents free cash flow. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures. Free cash flow excludes cash used for private company stock option exercises and cash used for acquisitions. Management believes that free cash flow is useful for investors because it provides them with an important perspective on the cash available for debt repayment and other strategic measures, after making necessary capital investments in property and equipment to support the Company's ongoing business operations, and provides them with the same measures that management uses as the basis for making resource allocation decisions. For a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow, see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow.” These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. - Tables Follow -   COTY INC. & SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (Unaudited)     Three Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, (in millions, except per share data) 2016   2015 2016   2015 Net revenues $   2,296.7 $   1,210.5 $   3,376.9 $   2,322.8 Cost of sales 892.3   467.7   1,337.1   911.4   as % of Net revenues 38.9 % 38.6 % 39.6 % 39.2 % Gross profit 1,404.4 742.8 2,039.8 1,411.4 Gross margin 61.1 % 61.4 % 60.4 % 60.8 %   Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,170.2 515.4 1,649.1 999.7 as % of Net revenues 51.0 % 42.6 % 48.8 % 43.0 % Amortization expense 95.2 18.9 116.4 38.1 Restructuring costs 15.8 10.6 23.2 72.7 Acquisition-related costs 135.9 45.5 217.4 61.3 Asset impairment charges —   —   —   5.5   Operating (loss) income (12.7 ) 152.4 33.7 234.1 as % of Net revenues (0.6 %) 12.6 % 1.0 % 10.1 % Interest expense, net 57.9 14.6 98.3 30.6 Loss on extinguishment of debt — 3.1 — 3.1 Other (income) expense, net (0.6 ) 24.1   0.7   23.8   (Loss) income before income taxes (70.0 ) 110.6 (65.3 ) 176.6 as % of Net revenues (3.0 %) 9.1 % (1.9 %) 7.6 % (Benefit) provision for income taxes (122.1 ) 13.0   (127.2 ) (54.1 ) Net income 52.1 97.6 61.9 230.7 as % of Net revenues 2.3 % 8.1 % 1.8 % 9.9 % Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 2.5 5.3 10.7 9.7 Net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests 2.8   3.3   4.4   6.3   Net income attributable to Coty Inc. $   46.8   $   89.0   $   46.8   $   214.7   as % of Net revenues 2.0 % 7.4 % 1.4 % 9.2 % Net income attributable to Coty Inc. per common share: Basic $ 0.06 $ 0.26 $ 0.09 $ 0.61 Diluted $ 0.06 $ 0.25 $ 0.09 $ 0.59 Weighted-average common shares outstanding: Basic 746.6 345.0 539.8 352.5 Diluted 752.4 354.3 545.8 362.0   Cash dividend declared per common share $ 0.125 $ — $ 0.400 $ 0.250     COTY INC.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 9 February 2017 by Military News Procter &amp; Gamble Co Is on Track to Give Shareholders $22 Billion in 2017 Call it the understatement of the fiscal year. Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller recently told investors that 2017 “is a year of significant value return to shareholders.” Does $22 billion sound significant to you? That’s how much the consumer-goods giant aims to deliver to its owners through dividends and stock repurchases. The mountain of cash is greater than the market capitalization of more than half of the members of the S&P 500, and it also represents a huge boost over P&G’s average return pace of about $13 billion per year. Image source: Getty Images. With fiscal 2017 half done, let’s check in on the company’s progress implementing one of the stock market’s biggest capital-return plans. Dividends and stock buybacks — $6.1 billion so far P&G has spent $3.6 billion on dividend payments over the last six months, which is slightly less than in the prior-year period. Don’t worry, though — the blue chip is still a Dividend Aristocrat, with 60 years of consecutive annual hikes behind it. The lower overall payout is just a quirk caused by the combination of a falling share count and the company’s tiny dividend boost for 2017. It’s 1% increase put it far behind rival Kimberly-Clark (NYSE: KMB) , which just gave its investors a 5% raise. P&G’s next dividend increase is likely to close that gap, but not by as much as you might think. Its official payout ratio has plunged to just one-third of earnings over the last two quarters, compared to 76% in fiscal 2016. However, that improvement is mainly because reported profits spiked thanks to a one-time profit from brand divestments. Focus just on continuing operations, and the company’s payout ratio is a high, but manageable, two-thirds of earnings, so P&G should have no problem hitting its $7 billion annual payment target. PG Shares Outstanding data by YCharts . Management has boosted its direct stock buyback spending to a $5 billion annual pace from $4 billion last year and $4.6 billion in 2015. The team is right on track with that goal, having spent $2.5 billion over the last six months. The good news for investors is that the outlay helped the outstanding share count fall 3% in the past year and by nearly 20% over the last decade. Beauty deal — $9.4 billion in total P&G last quarter closed its deal to sell 41 of its beauty brands to Coty. And as it did in the Duracell battery sale , the company structured the transfer so that it would result in a significantly reduced outstanding share count. It received $11.4 billion of total value from the beauty transaction, almost all of which went toward lowering its share count. Meanwhile, the $5 billion profit it recorded on the deal roughly doubled reported earnings, to $10.8 billion, through the first two quarters of the year. There are no comparable brand divestments in the works now that P&G has whittled its portfolio down to management’s 66 favorite franchises from almost 170 in fiscal 2013. That effectively removes the single biggest piece of its return program for fiscal 2018 and beyond. Looking forward However, the outlook for elevated capital returns is still healthy. P&G plans to slice a further $10 billion out of its expense structure over the next five fiscal years. Meanwhile, the negative pressure from foreign currency swings is likely to let up from the brutal pace of the last two years. And finally, core profit growth is back to its long-run average thanks to a solid uptick in P&G’s growth rate. Add it all up, and executives believe they can return about $16 billion to investors per year in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, which would put its average return at almost $18 billion per year , up from a $12 billion annual pace from 2010 through 2015. 10 stocks we like better than Procter and Gamble When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Baby Products P&G under fire in Korea for selling diapers allegedly containing toxic substances Photo: Pampers Personal care and household goods maker Procter and Gamble is under fire for selling diapers that allegedly contain potentially toxic substances. Although large discount retailers have pulled the company's Pampers Baby Dry diapers off their shelves following the controversy, the South Korean government has not been able to issue an official recall or pursue punitive measures because there are no clear regulations here regarding the detected toxins. On Jan. 24, French consumer magazine 60 Millions de Consommateurs (60 Million Consumers) reported that a study had revealed the presence of traces of "potentially toxic" substances in many of the disposable diapers sold in France. The list of the potentially dangerous products included Pampers Baby Dry, which is sold in Korea. The French magazine had claimed that it had detected 0.000533 picogram per gram toxicity equivalency factor of dioxin, approximately 1/188th the level permitted for baby products in Europe. Late last week, Lotte Mart, Homeplus and E-mart announced they would pull Pampers Baby Dry from their product lineup. On Friday, the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards, which is under the purview of the Industry Ministry, said it would begin a safety investigation into the P&G product. The hit to P&G comes just a month after the company's fabric refresher Febreze was cleared from a list of potentially dangerous products released by the Environment Ministry. Last year, the product had been suspected of including toxic levels of an antimicrobial agent that could damage the lungs. P&G has denied the French magazine's allegations that these toxins were included in their products. "We don't know how those tests were conducted," a spokeswoman for the company said. "What we can say for certain is that those compounds were never used intentionally in our products. Even the amounts that the French tests claim were detected (in the products) are at an extremely minute and harmless level." P&G is also declining to refund consumers for previous purchases of Pampers Baby Dry, maintaining its stance there is nothing wrong with the products. However, consumers and distributors remain wary because the government does not have any clear standards on how much of these compounds could be considered safe. Currently in Korea, diapers are categorized under the Children's Products Safety Act as requiring "safety management." Diapers must undergo testing for 19 different chemicals including formaldehyde, but the screening list does not include dioxin or pesticide compounds that the magazine claimed were found in the P&G diapers including hexachlorobenzene and pentachloronitrobenzene. The absence of clear government regulations in consumer product safety is making consumers, especially mothers, anxious about all of the other products that may have gone unchecked. In online communities, some mothers have even taken the issue into their own hands. "I'm going to personally study the compounds in various baby products that I use," said one post on a popular online community that focuses on baby care. The government has said that after concluding its investigation of the Pampers Baby Dry products, it may expand the investigation to include all diapers sold in Korea.

The number of shoppers visiting M-commerce online platform, where transactions are carried out via mobile money, has tripled in the past two years. Traditional shopping still dominates the market, although supermarkets and malls, a distant second, are catching up as the preferred shopping outlets for Kenyans. P&G managing director Vivek Sunder yesterday said the country's retail landscape is among the most advanced in the region with high penetration in many product categories. “Kenya was reclassified as a middle-income economy in 2015, and this is clearly being evidenced by the shopping habits and rising consumerism,” he said. Malls and proposed shopping complexes occupy more than 470,000 square metres of land including residential areas, and attracts retailers who do not want to shop in the city. P&G’s FMCG data shows Kenyans spend the bulk of their income (about 60 per cent) on food and beverages, and 23 per cent goes to personal and household care products. Euromonitor projections show total retail is expected to grow by 84 per cent to $16 billion (Sh1.658 trillion) in 2020 from $9 billion (Sh993.1billion). Supermarkets have become permanent fixtures in the rapidly growing number of malls. The survey shows more than half of urban dwellers shop in supermarkets. They are driven by the belief that supermarkets stock well-known brands, generally perceived to be quality. E-commerce is a growing segment within the retail sector, however, many Kenyans are still reluctant to shop at online stores despite the convenience and easy access to great deals, the report sys. "Today, less than one per cent of Kenyan retail sales go through e-commerce and this is likely to hold in the foreseeable future," Vivek said. "Operational and logistical challenges are the main obstacles for the growth of e-commerce and more shoppers will feel comfortable buying items from an online store once the logistical issues of time, location are fixed." While overall retail in Kenya grew by 13 per cent last year, modern retail (supermarkets) grew by 18 per cent, indicating the increasing importance of supermarkets as a retail channel. Supermarkets contributed 30 per cent of the FMCG retail sales for the 2015-16 financial year, and projections show this sector will keep growing as consumers opt to shop in bulk.

Find out why. Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Feb 9, 2017 at 4:45PM The stock market soared on Thursday, and the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite all hit new records for the day. Gains of just over 0.5% largely hinged on positive news from earnings season as well as generally favorable macroeconomic trends that pointed toward further strength in the U.S. economy. However, not all stocks managed to participate in the rally. Among the worst performers on the day were Coeur Mining (NYSE:CDE), Coty (NYSE:COTY), and iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT). Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly. Coeur stock tarnishes after quarterly results Shares of Coeur Mining fell 22% after the company reported fourth-quarter results that included a 10% drop in sales and adjusted net income that just barely eked above the break-even mark. The mining company did manage to achieve record production in the fourth quarter, which included 3.9 million ounces of silver and 102,500 ounces of gold. Full-year all-in sustaining costs also eased lower, pointing to favorable internal production efficiencies within Coeur. However, the big question for Coeur is the direction of precious metals prices, which many have feared could deteriorate in a rising interest rate environment. Moreover, if costs rise in 2017, then that could make it even more important for Coeur to see favorable silver-price movement in order to sustain its turnaround and remain even marginally profitable. Image source: Getty Images. Coty looks less beautiful Coty stock declined 9% in the wake of its fiscal second-quarter financial results, which included a nearly one-third drop in its adjusted earnings per share and a 7% drop in pro forma sales. The quarter was the first after Coty completed its merger with the beauty business of Procter & Gamble, and that created some difficulties in managing inventory and dealing with increasing competition in the beauty space. CEO Camillo Pane noted, "We will need to tackle short-term challenges like the ones we faced in the first semester, complete the P&G Beauty Business integration, and most importantly, implement new programs to drive growth and further strengthen our brand portfolio." Yet Coty remains optimistic that in time, the acquisition will prove to have been a smart move, and the beauty products company has plans to make the most of its new opportunities. iRobot breaks down Finally, shares of iRobot dropped 13%. The maker of Roomba automated vacuum cleaners and other products reported its fourth-quarter financial results, which included solid revenue gains. However, investors didn't seem happy with a nearly 30% drop in net income, even though iRobot's earnings per share were actually better than the consensus forecast among those following the stock. iRobot also gave guidance for 2017, which included sales growth of 17% to 19% and adjusted earnings of $1.35 to $1.65 per share. Those numbers seemed good, and it wasn't immediately clear whether analyst expectations included results from a strategic purchase. In any event, iRobot didn't indicate any fundamental problems with its business, and long-term investors might find today's drop to be a promising opportunity.

Blink brings a luxury experience to value fitness with groundbreaking brand positioning that resonates with a broad range of consumers. We believe that exercise isn't just about how it makes you look, it's also about how you feel. From our Mood Lifter™ staff to our inspiring gym design and energizing music, Blink is designed to make Every Body Happy regardless of fitness level or body type. Why Invest in Blink Fitness? From day 1 and continuing through all stages of opening and owning a Blink, you'll receive support from an executive team with fitness industry and business experience from brands that include: Equinox, PepsiCo, Procter and Gamble, Whole Foods Market, Coach, Barney's, Starbucks, Bliss, and Ann Taylor. We have a simple, labor-light operational model with virtually no cash transactions and no inventory or spoilage risk. The Franchising Opportunity All the Blink gyms open or in development are located in the NY metro area so this is a ground floor opportunity with wide open national availability. Propelled by a trend towards health and wellness, the fitness industry has seen more than 20 years of consistent growth and revenues are projected to reach $30 billion by 2018. Despite this, more than 85% of Americans do not belong to a gym. As a result, this is an opportunity with virtually limitless growth potential. Our turnkey development process includes a seasoned fitness operations executive as a direct support point of contact for franchisees, an industry-leading 150 hours in training, a national network of real estate broker recommendations facilitated by our VP of development, layout design of your proposed gym, 24/7 tech support, and state-of-the-art business performance and consumer feedback tools. Qualifications & Investment Requirements: *"Figures reflect the actual average annual gross sales and average annual EBITDA and EBITDA margin of 3 affiliate-owned and operated Blink Fitness Gyms (operational for at least 4, but less than 5, full years as of December 31, 2015) during their 4th full 12 months of operation.

Opinion Op-Ed Op-Ed In the age of Uber and Snapchat, antitrust law needs an update Uber headquarters Los Angeles Times Pedestrians walk past Uber’s headquarters on Market St. in San Francisco on Dec. 18, 2016. Pedestrians walk past Uber’s headquarters on Market St. in San Francisco on Dec. 18, 2016. (Los Angeles Times) Todd G. Buchholz, Victoria J. Buchholz Consumer watchdog groups have denounced the pending AT&T and Time Warner merger, claiming that it would put too much power in the hands of too few. They needn’t worry. Powerful hands are losing their grip. The gig economy, low financing rates and speedier technology have created a more accessible marketplace that requires less trust-busting by federal officials. Every high schooler learns about the “robber barons,” the 19th century industrialists who stomped on competitors and ruled over trains, steel and oil. President McKinley launched the trust-busting era to bring down those titans. But here is what the schoolbooks leave out: During that period, consumer prices in the United States were flat to falling, while per capita gross domestic product steadily rose. It is hard to understand why the barons used their sweeping power to increase output and cut prices when economic textbooks teach us that monopolists do the opposite. The answer? Their market power was not permanent and they were constantly fighting off invaders, circumstances that required them to keep prices down. Worrisome anticompetitive behavior often results when businesses benefit from government favors. Trust-busting continued throughout the 20th century. The Nixon administration launched a 13-year fight against IBM before slinking away in 1982. Now, IBM doesn’t even make personal computers. In 1998, with great fanfare, the Clinton administration dragged a fidgety Bill Gates into a deposition and accused him of enforcing a stranglehold on Internet computing. Meanwhile, Steve Jobs was in Cupertino, Calif., unveiling the iMac and plotting to rip open markets with the iPod and iPhone. The Federal Trade Commission fought a merger between Blockbuster and the Hollywood Entertainment video company in 2005, worried that these hapless firms were locking up the VHS and DVD markets. Now the FTC is concerned that the most valuable company in the world, Apple, is being bullied by the 98th most valuable company in the world, Qualcomm. In an announcement last week, the FTC alleged that Qualcomm demands Apple pay money and sign long-term contracts in exchange for using Qualcomm’s latest technology. This used to be called capitalism. Here, antitrust crusaders are actually trying to defend a Goliath against a relative David — a new but equally inane strategy.  In today’s modern economy, barriers to entry are falling, not rising. Invaders are poised nearly everywhere. Procter & Gamble owned a 70% share of the men’s razor market until some daring dude launched the Dollar Shave Club with an outrageous YouTube ad called “Our Blades are [expletive] Great” that went viral in 2012 and attracted millions of subscribers. After ballooning from a bookstore to a global superstore, Amazon continues to scare firms in varied sectors, not with higher prices but with lower prices and quicker delivery — even delivery by drone. The world’s former category-killer, Wal-Mart, has been fretting about how to compete. Airbnb has increased the number of rooms available in U.S. cities by 20%. Uber is worth more than Hertz and Avis combined. In the heyday of antitrust enforcement, the 1960s and 1970s, start-up firms needed to raise tens of millions of dollars to build factories and hire employees. Now, firms with compelling intellectual property and strong leadership can take on market leaders with a website, a few swivel chairs and a single-serve coffee-maker. Even areas that once seemed off-limits to the private sector are attracting competition. The risky, previously untouchable commercial space industry has grown super-competitive, with Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic, Elon Musk’s SpaceX, and Boeing and Arianespace vying for business. Does this dynamic environment mean that President Trump should fire the FTC and the Department of Justice’s antitrust division? Of course not. But their methods should be scrutinized and harmonized. Under current law, merging firms must answer to either the FTC or the DOJ or both. Sometimes bureaucrats seem to flip a coin to decide which team handles the case. They employ different standards and examine different evidence. Last year, the House of Representatives passed the Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act, the “SMARTER Act,” which offers a sensible approach. It would require the FTC and DOJ to follow the same evidentiary standards and procedures. The agencies should also focus on areas where intervention could do the most good. Worrisome anticompetitive behavior often results when businesses benefit from government favors. For instance, the federal government should challenge states that prevent Tesla from selling cars directly to consumers. Such states force consumers to visit local dealerships, whose owners are often contributors to state legislators. Most important, antitrust enforcement should focus on cases where mergers would actually damage consumers through persistently higher prices. The merger between AT&T and Time Warner may raise eyebrows, but the deal is not particularly threatening in an era when 30% of millennials have already “cut the cord” from their cable provider and a nimble new content company such as Snapchat attracts 160 million viewers to watch 10 billion videos each day. Instead of entertainment, regulators should examine local hospital mergers, which tend to raise prices for patients who are not usually in a position to shop around. Antitrust enforcement needs an update. In today’s quick-paced economy, we have no more use for a lumbering bureaucracy than we do MSN Live messenger or a Blockbuster video store. Todd G. Buchholz is a former White House director of economic policy and the author of “The Price of Prosperity: Why Rich Nations Fail and How to Renew Them.” Victoria J. Buchholz is an intellectual property attorney. Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss An appeals court has ruled: Trump's travel ban will remain blocked.

As previously announced, all our indictors have increased: revenue, operating margin (amount and percentage of revenue), headline diluted EPS and dividend payout. On top of these positive elements, it worth mentioning the very high level of free cash flow generation and debt reduction. These results have been achieved against the backdrop of a modest organic growth rate, mainly due to lower US revenue as a result of media accounts lost in 2015 and the first half of 2016, but also to serious issues at Razorfish. This led us to merge Razorfish and SapientNitro in order to create the worlds first entity dedicated to consumer experience, and to book an impairment charge in our 2016 accounts. After this impairment, the balance sheet now shows very solid indicators with a debt / equity ratio of 0.21 and liquidity of close to five billion euro, considerably enhancing our agility. 2016 was devoted to the implementation of Publicis Groupes new organization and transformation from an "advertising holding company to a "connecting company with the creation of a completely new approach called "The Power of One. The results of this have been excellent since they were first felt in the summer of 2016, with remarkable client successes such as Asda in the UK, Wal-Mart in the USA, account wins including Merck, KFC and, more recently, HSBC, but also the return of Special K and the retention of Mars with a budget extension and the recent retention of GMC after a lengthy review. This new approach is still in the very early stages but, given the results already achieved, strikes me as very promising. 2017 clearly marks the beginning of a new era, as much for the market as for our Groupe. Society is evolving spectacularly as the exponential development of digital and other technologies obliges companies to undergo very deep transformation. Outcomes of referendums in the UK and Italy and elections in the US have rung in geopolitical upheavals bringing with them new uncertainties for Europe whereas Americas traditional positions seem to produce economic consequences that are difficult to gauge. Our Groupe is ready for this new world thanks to its high-potential digital assets and capacities to help our clients embrace this new order, including help with their own transformation. And we have a new generation at the helm. After 30 years devoted to developing the superb brand that is Publicis and making the Groupe a global player, I will be passing over the chairmanship of the Management Board to Arthur Sadoun on June 1. Arthur has demonstrated the very broad range of his abilities over the last ten years, he is a great professional driven by his passionate approach to clients and his desire to make them winners. He understands the world of tomorrow, knows how to attract talent and bring people together to work in multidisciplinary teams, which is the only way to get the best out of The Power of One which has already proved such a success. As for myself, subject to approval from the shareholders, I will succeed Elisabeth Badinter as Chair of the Supervisory Board and will have the immense pleasure of having her continued vigilant presence on the Board. At this point, I would like to express heartfelt thanks to the people who, through their input over the last three decades, have made Publicis what it is, namely the worlds third-ranked global communications group, first in digital, with operations in over 100 countries. Over the last 30 years, Publicis has multiplied its revenue by 50, its staff by 25 and its market cap by 100. We are and will continue to be ambitious. I know that our successors are ready to step in, and they are energetic, curious, committed, creative and very determined. This new team will build Publicis Groupes future by achieving the ultimate goal of our transformation with The Power of One. To defy the challenges of the future, Arthur Sadoun can count on the top-flight expertise of Management Board members Jean-Michel Etienne and Anne-Gabrielle Heilbronner, enriched by the arrival of Steve King whose stellar career to date commands admiration. To achieve our future objectives we must improve our organic growth. The first half of 2017 will still bear the marks of previous difficulties, but as of the second half year, the Groupe should be back to levels of growth which are more comparable to its peers. And beyond, growth should be sustainably back on track with performances that are more consistent with our profile and history. Our recent commercial successes, which we should leverage to improve our margins and continue to generate substantial cash flow, give me confidence about our future. This is why we are planning to propose to the Shareholders AGM to approve a 16% increase of our dividend to 1.85 euro, and we are confirming our objectives for 2018. Publicis Groupes Supervisory Board met on February 8, 2017, under the chairmanship of Elisabeth Badinter, to examine the annual accounts for 2016 presented by Maurice Lévy, Chairman of the Management Board and Chief Executive Officer. 1 - KEY FIGURES EUR million, excepting percentages and per share data (in euro)   2016   2015   2016 vs. 2015 Revenue   9,733   9,601   +1.4% Operating margin before Depreciation & Amortization 1,682 1,661 % of revenue 17.3% 17.3% Operating margin 1,516 1,487 +2.0% % of revenue 15.6% 15.5% Operating income 9 1,378 Net income attributable to the Groupe (527) 901 Headline EPS, diluted (1)   4.46   4.39   +1.6% Free Cash Flow before changes in working capital requirements   1,261   1,097   +14.9% (1) After elimination of impairment charges, amortization of intangibles arising from acquisitions, main capital gains (losses) on disposals and revaluation of earn-out payments 2 - BUSINESS ACTIVITY IN 2016 Publicis Groupes business environment was one of global growth comparable to that of 2015, but characterized nonetheless by recovery in the emerging markets and continued sluggish performance in the American and European economies. Inflation remained low. Organic growth was weak, as expected, at +0.7% due to accounts lost in 2015 and early 2016 and to issues at Razorfish. Given this context, the Groupe has taken the required decisions to re-launch growth, fully benefit from Razorfishs assets, and keep costs under strict control. Therefore, operating margin rate improved slightly and Free Cash Flow rose by 14.9% to 1.261 billion euro. 2.1 - Q4 2016 revenue Publicis Groupes consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was 2,665 million euro, down 2.5% from 2,734 million in Q4 2015. Exchange rates impacted revenue negatively by 27 million euro, i.e. 1.0% of revenue in Q4 2015. Net acquisitions contributed 25 million euro to revenue in Q4 2016, i.e. the equivalent of 0.9% of Q4 2015 revenue. Growth at constant exchange rates was -1.6%. Organic growth was -2.5% in the fourth quarter. It was negative due to media accounts lost in 2015 and early 2016, the fact that certain digital projects reached completion at Razorfish before others had fully ramped up, and a very unfavorable basis on comparison in North America in Q4 2015 (+6.3%) where the market was not as strong as anticipated. Breakdown of Q4 2016 revenue by region EUR   Revenue   Organic   Reported million   Q4 2016   Q4 2015   growth   growth Europe 768   770 +5.1% -0.3% North America 1,362 1,417 -6.9% -3.9% Asia Pacific 321 320 -1.5% +0.3% Latin America 124 134 -1.1% -7.5% Middle East & Africa   90   93   +1.3%   -3.2% Total   2,665   2,734   -2.5%   -2.5% 2.2 - 2016 Revenue In 2016, Publicis Groupes consolidated revenue rose to 9,733 million euro, an increase of 1.4% from 9,601 million in 2015. Exchange rates adversely affected revenue by 177 million euro, i.e. 1.8% of 2015 revenue. Net acquisitions contributed 247 million euro to revenue in 2016, i.e. the equivalent of 2.6% of 2015 revenue. Growth at constant exchange rates was +3.3%. Organic growth was 0.7% in 2016. Breakdown of 2016 revenue by region EUR   Revenue   Organic   Reported million   2016   2015   growth   growth Europe 2,760   2,664 +5.9% +3.6% North America 5,236 5,184 -2.2% +1.0% Asia Pacific 1,085 1,066 +1.5% +1.8% Latin America 365 412 +2.9% -11.4% Middle East & Africa   287   275   +1.1%   +4.4% Total   9,733   9,601   +0.7%   +1.4% Europe posted 3.6% revenue growth. When the impact of acquisitions and exchange rates is factored out, organic growth was +5.9%. France performed well (+6.5%), and Germany and Italy both posted strong momentum (+8.0% and 6.3% respectively), all shored up by the improving macroeconomic situation. The situation was volatile in Russia where growth for the full year was +11.8%. The UK showed a marked improvement at +5.9% (including organic growth in excess of 8% in the second half of the year, following on close to 4% in the first half). Overall, digital progressed sharply in Europe, achieving growth of 11.1%. North America reported growth of 1.0% but organic growth of -2.2% due notably to a decline in the fourth quarter (-6.9% on an organic basis). This downturn is attributed to the loss of accounts, particularly during the Mediapalooza, but also to the completion of certain digital projects at a time when more recent projects have yet to ramp up to cruising speed. In addition, organic growth was high in Q4 2015 (+6.3%) which served as the basis of comparison for Q4 2016, where the market was not as strong as anticipated. Asia Pacific achieved reported growth of 1.8% and organic growth of 1.5%. China decreased in the second half year (-6.0%) as a result of difficulties encountered by Genedigi, after achieving +4.4% in the first half year. India and Singapore posted full year growth of 0.5% and 8.1% respectively. Latin America was down 11.4% on a reported basis, mainly because of exchange rates, whilst organic growth was +2.9% for the period. Brazil saw its revenue fall by 1.9% in 2016 despite Rio hosting the Olympic Games. This represents an outperformance in a declining market overall. Mexico continued to post strong growth (+7.7% in 2016). The Middle East & Africa region achieved reported growth of 4.4% and organic growth of 1.1%. 2016 organic growth by region: digital and analog     Europe   North America   Asia Pacific   Latin America   Middle East & Africa   Total Digital   +11.1%   -0.4%   +9.5%   -1.4%   +11.2%   +3.2% Analog   +1.5%   -5.3%   -2.8%   +4.0%   -1.5%   -2.0% Total   +5.9%   -2.2%   +1.5%   +2.9%   +1.1%   +0.7% The Groupes growth continued to be driven by its digital activities (organic growth of +3.2%). North America saw its digital growth decline by 0.4% due to the impact of media accounts lost and the completion of certain digital projects at Razorfish at a time when new projects are only slowly gathering speed. Razorfish posted negative growth in double digits. It should also be mentioned that analog activities continued to decline. 3 - ANALYSIS OF THE KEY FIGURES 3.1 - Income statement Operating margin before depreciation and amortization reached 1,682 million euro in 2016, up 1.3% from 1,661 million in 2015, i.e. a percentage margin of 17.3% of revenue (stable versus 2015): - Personnel costs totaled 6,059 million euro at December 31, 2016, up 1.2% from 5,988 million in 2015. Fixed personnel costs amounted to 5,268 million, i.e. 54.1% of total revenue (unchanged versus 2015). Freelance costs reached 444 million euro in 2016, after 414 million in 2015. Restructuring costs stood at 73 million euro in 2016 as the Groupe implements its reorganization and adjusts to an environment that is increasingly digital-oriented, while continuing to generate synergies from the Sapient acquisition. Operational efficiency will be enhanced by the various projects in which the Groupe continues to invest (ERP roll-out, the development of production platforms, on-going regionalization of the Shared Services Centers, as well as a number of technological developments). - Other operating costs (excluding Depreciation & Amortization) totaled 1,992 million euro after 1,952 million in 2015. These costs represented 20.5% of consolidated revenue (versus 20.3% in 2015). Depreciation for the period was 166 million euro, i.e. a 4.6% decrease on 2015. Operating margin rose to 1,516 million euro, i.e. a 2% increase over 1,487 million in 2015. As a percentage of revenue, the margin stood at 15.6%, compared with 15.5% in 2015. As a percentage of revenue, operating margin was impacted by 20 basis points as a result of acquisitions and currencies impact versus the euro. At constant perimeter and currencies, operating margin as a percentage of revenue improved by 30 basis points due to the positive impact in 2016 of cost reduction measures implemented since end 2015 including Sapient cost synergies, lower restructuring charges, partly offset by higher costs related to the ERP deployment and other IT initiatives. The operating margin by region was 15.5% in Europe, 15.5% in North America, 15.9% in Asia Pacific, 14.0% in Latin America and 17.4% for the Middle East & Africa region. Amortization of intangibles arising from acquisitions totaled 79 million euro in 2016, down from 89 million in 2015. The Publicis.Sapients assets, which goodwill and intangible assets amount to 4.9 billion euro, have been analyzed thoroughly given the underperformance of some of its entities. The solution hub has been confronted to delays in the integration of acquisitions, in particular Razorfish. A new management team has been put in place and required investments in consulting teams have been revalued. New forecasts now factor in a faster-than-expected growth in the business transformation activity but a slower-than-anticipated growth for the remaining digital activities, which in total, will impact estimated growth of the coming years. In order to take those new market conditions into account, which impact both the value of some of Publicis.Sapients assets and future cash flows of the solution hub, the Groupe booked a non-cash depreciation charge of 1,440 million euro (including 1,392 million for Publicis.Sapient), after an impairment of 28 million in 2015. Other non-recurring income (expenses) amounted to income of 12 million euro, corresponding mainly to the capital gain on the disposal of Mediavision, after income of 8 million euro in 2015. Operating income totaled 9 million euro in 2016, versus 1,378 million in 2015. Financial income (expense), excluding earn-out revaluation, amounted to a net expense of 74 million euro in 2016, after an expense of 77 million euro in 2015. The cost of net financial debt is stable - 74 million euro in 2016 as in 2015  and the other components of the financial income (expense), mainly foreign exchange gains and losses as well as expenses relating to the discounting of long-term provisions, are slightly improving, from 3 million euro expense in 2015 to 0 in 2016. Revaluation of earn-out costs totaled 108 million euro in 2016, up from 12 million in 2015. This includes revaluations concerning Genedigi (end of earn-out), Heartbeat, Turner Duckworth, 3 Share as well as a certain number of more recently acquired subsidiaries whose expected performance has been revised upwards. Income tax for the period was 342 million euro, i.e. an effective tax rate of 29.0%, by comparison with 386 million in 2015, when the effective tax rate was 29.9%. The Associates share of profit was a negative 5 million euro in 2016, after a positive 8 million in 2015. Minority interests totaled 7 million euro in 2016, versus 10 million in 2015. Overall, Net income attributable to the Groupe was a loss of 527 million euro in 2016, after a profit of 901 million in 2015. After elimination of impairment charges, amortization of intangibles arising on acquisitions, the main capital gains (or losses) on disposals and the reappraisal of earn-out costs, headline net income group share was 1,015 million euro up 2.3%. Headline diluted EPS was 4.46 euros up 1.6%. 3.2 - Free Cash Flow Before changes in working capital requirements, Free Cash Flow was 1,261 million euros in 2016, compared to 1,097 million in 2015. 3.3 - Net debt Net debt amounted to 1,244 million euro at December 31, 2016 (i.e. a debt / equity ratio of 0.21) down from 1,872 million at December 31, 2015. The Groupes average net debt was 2,385 million euro in 2016, down from 2,429 million in 2015, bearing in mind that the Sapient acquisition was completed on February 6, 2015. 4  HIGHLIGHTS FROM 2016 4.1 - Reorganization During the first half of 2016, Publicis Groupe reorganized its operations by placing its clients at the very core of the Groupe, thus providing them with access to all the Groupes capabilities ("The Power of One) for their commercial, marketing or transformation requirements. This reorganization entailed Publicis.Sapient, one of the Groupes hubs, merging SapientNitro and Razorfish to create SapientRazorfish, thus combining the consumer experience and technological know-how of the two entities to meet clients needs even better than before. The merging of these two entities led to the creation of an undisputed leader positioned as a new type of partner, capable of rethinking the future based on a client-centric model, while leveraging extensive experience in change management. 4.2 - Groupe commitment to start-ups - Viva Technology Paris. In conjunction with Groupe les Echos, Publicis Groupe staged a global event in Paris bringing together start-ups and the main stakeholders in the digital environment. This rendezvous, from June 30 to July 2, 2016, attracted 5,000 start-ups, dozens of major industrial groups and investors, and included over 300 conferences with the top names in the global hi-tech sector. With over 45,000 visitors in three days, Viva Technology proved a tremendous success and underscored the pre-eminent place of Publicis Groupe in the global digital economy. The annual event will be back for the second edition from June 15, 2017, just before the Cannes Lions Festival. - Publicis90. For its 90th anniversary, Publicis Groupe launched a project named Publicis90. The idea was to provide 90 projects or start-ups with financial aid and the support of the Groupes digital experts. After an initial phase of stringent selection over a period of several months, the winners were picked from among the 3,500 contestants representing 130 countries, and received their awards at a ceremony held during Viva Technology. 4.3 - Global partnership with Tencent Publicis Groupe has announced a strategic partnership with Tencent, the internet giant that operates the most popular social and media platforms in China. This partnership is a first-of-its-kind collaboration between a global communications group and Chinas biggest internet company. It spans the Groupes three hubs (Publicis Media, Publicis Communications and Publicis.Sapient) as well as Tencents eleven product lines. This agreement will cement the groups relationship at global level while providing clients with access to all Tencents innovations via a unique, borderless approach built on three pillars, i.e. tremendous innovation capacity, an exceptional source of data, and innovative web content. 4.4 - Acquisitions - MercerBell, a leading Australian agency in the field of customer experience. MercerBell is specialized in CRM and digital strategy, creativity, content and technology, and will be integrated into Saatchi & Saatchi. This agency, which was founded in 1999, has a team of 65 professionals and a customer base that includes Toyota, Foxtel, Quantas, BT, Allianz and ASX - Vertiba, the Salesforce partner, is specialized in marketing solutions. Founded in 2010, Vertiba is headquartered in Boulder, Colorado. Vertibas skills will be integrated into the Publicis.Sapient platform - Seven Seconds, the London (UK) based e-commerce and digital specialist, was founded in 2013 and will be integrated into BBH. Its main clients are British Airways, Barclays, Boots, Tesco Retail and Tesco Bank - Venus Communications, is a leading public relations agency in Vietnam. Venus has been integrated into the MSL brand, which in turn is part of Publicis One in Vietnam. Over the last ten years, Venus and MSL have worked together successfully on numerous assignments. The agency, which was founded in 1998, has 40 employees and a prestigious client portfolio that includes MasterCard, FedEx, Rolls Royce, BAT, Mead Johnson and Sanofi - Troyka Group : Publicis Groupe has taken a stake in West Africas first fully-integrated communications services group. The Troyka group is comprised of six agencies, i.e. Insight Communications, The Thinkshop, All Seasons Media, Media Perspectives, The Quadrant Company, and Hotsauce. Starting out with Insight Communications in 1980, the Troyka group now has 300 employees over six agencies across the entire region. The Troyka agencies work with prestigious international brands such as Heineken, Shell, Samsung, Unilever, Google, P&G, Microsoft, Ford and Axa, as well as with national brands that include Oando, Nestoil, Africa Investor, Jagal, and Olam. Publicis Groupe has been investing regularly in Africa in recent years, in view of the high growth potential of this market. By way of this equity investment, Publicis Groupe will use Troyka to launch its network in Nigeria, thereby creating a powerful communications agency that will have a competitive edge in all skills sets in West Africa. 4.5 - Finance On October 28, 2016, Publicis Groupe  rated Baa2 by Moodys and BBB+ by Standard and Poors (both with a stable outlook)  announced that it had successfully priced its EUR 500 million bond issue maturing November 3, 2023, with an annual coupon of 0.5%. The net proceeds will be used to partially repay the USD 1.6 billion bank loan subscribed in January 2015 to fund the acquisition of Sapient Corporation Inc., and to fund the Groupes general corporate purposes. 5 - GOVERNANCE Publicis Groupes Supervisory Board appointed Arthur Sadoun to succeed Maurice Lévy as Chairman of the Groupes Management Board. From June 1, 2017, Arthur Sadoun will become Chairman of the Management Board which will be joined on the same date by Steve King, the current CEO of Publicis Media, who will team up with Jean-Michel Etienne, Executive Vice-President and CFO, and Anne-Gabrielle Heilbronner, Secretary General. To develop the Groupe, the Management Board can count on top-flight leaders and the Groupes transformation team: Alan Wexler and Chip Register at Publicis.Sapient, Nick Colucci at Publicis Health, Jarek Ziebinski at Publicis One, as well as Rishad Tobaccowala in the field of strategy and the client-centric approach. The Supervisory Board has proposed that, upon completion of his term of office, Maurice Lévy join its ranks and take over as Chairman. This motion will be put to a vote before the shareholders at their AGM on May 31, 2017. 6 - OUTLOOK The implementation of "One company and the transformation from a "holding to a "connecting company are taking place according to the announced plan, with an excellent feedback from clients to the "Power of One proposal. Recent successes in client retention (GMC, Mars, Special K) as well as client and budget wins (HPE, USAA, HSBC) are promising signs that Publicis Groupes growth will resume. The first half of 2017 will be impacted by some account losses and the difficulties at Razorfish, but they will progressively be offset by the ramp up of account wins. The 2018 plan should be delivered as expected. The economic and business environment for our clients on one hand, and the "One company and transformation concepts on the other hand, should be favorable to Publicis Groupe. * * * Disclaimer Certain information contained in this document, other than historical information, may constitute forward-looking statements or unaudited financial forecasts.

(AMZN) Stock Is More Valuable Than You Think Why Sprint Corp (S) Stock Is Worth at Least 50% More Recent Posts: Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD) Stock Rockets 30% Higher. Ditch It! Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is More Valuable Than You Think Why Sprint Corp (S) Stock Is Worth at Least 50% More View All Posts The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) stock provides a play for contrarians heading into its fourth-quarter earnings report. Earnings and sales have declined year-over-year in each of the last six quarters, which should keep expectations low. Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts appear to be exiting KO stock en masse. Source: Leo Hidalgo via Flickr (Modified) Morgan Stanley cut Coca-Cola stock to ‘Equal Weight’ in December; Goldman Sachs downgraded KO to ‘Sell’ last month and Wells Fargo followed with its own re-rating to Neutral barely a week later. For investors who like to buy at the point of maximum pessimism, the Coca-Cola earnings report looks like an opportunity. Of course, KO stock isn’t likely to make a huge gain off of the Coca-Cola earnings report; the stock generally doesn’t move all that much. In fact, the relatively quiet movement in Coca-Cola stock actually has been one reason analysts have turned bearish. Those analysts argue that in a more optimistic market, with broad indexes at all-time highs, KO stock’s “defensive” nature seems less attractive. Thus, investors are “rotating” away from safe, solid names like Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) into higher-risk, higher-reward issues. Perhaps this is true, but that argument only works as long as broad markets remain at or near their highs. And for Q4, that pessimism seems to leave KO stock well-positioned for gains coming out of its report. When expectations are low, after all, it’s difficult to disappoint. But the Q4 report also has long-term implications. It will be the first earnings release after the appointment of new CEO James Quincey. Quincey isn’t new to Coca-Cola; he has worked at the company for twenty years. And outgoing CEO Muhtar Kent doesn’t leave until May. But the Q4 earnings call might give Quincey a chance to detail the company’s plans to deal with consumer shifts away from soda. Those plans may be of more interest to investors in KO stock than the Q4 numbers. The KO Stock Numbers Analyst consensus projects KO stock will generate fourth-quarter earnings of $0.38, down a penny year-over-year. Revenue is expected to decline sharply, falling 8.7% year-over-year. Those estimates aren’t quite as bad as they sound, however. The strong dollar is affecting revenue: it reduced Q3 revenue by 2%, for instance. Coca-Cola also has refranchised bottling operations, which has affected revenue. In the third quarter, for instance, reported revenue was down 7%. But the company’s figure of ‘organic’ revenue — growth excluding divested operations and currency effects — rose 3%. KO is still targeting over $600 million in productivity savings this year. And KO also has brought in nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars in proceeds from the refranchising proceeds. The cost savings and cash inflow are being used in part to fund new marketing, but also are improving margins. And if Coca-Cola earnings show further margin improvements, and a surprise earnings beat that shows some bottom-line growth, the narrative here could change. With analysts pricing in a declining business, any sort of growth in Q4 could provide a nice boost to KO stock.

The Lowdown is Ad Age's weekly look at news nuggets from across the world of marketing, including trends, campaign tidbits, executive comings and goings and more. Among Tom Brady's many amazing feats on Sunday was getting Aaron Rodgers' girlfriend into the game. Olivia Munn, who's been dating the Green Bay Packers' quarterback, starred in Proactiv's first-ever Super Bowl ad, a contingency buy that aired during the overtime spawned by the New England Patriots comeback. The first overtime in Super Bowl history may have seemed totally unexpected. But not by Proactiv, said a spokeswoman in an email: "Proactiv strategically planned to air its branded spot during OT, as they knew it was going to be a close game, and it would be the perfect opportunity to showcase a more brand-focused approach vs. the traditional direct-marketing approach that's historically been the company's focus." A Proactiv spokeswoman did not disclose how much it paid Fox to run the ad, but said the cost of buying the overtime option was less than what it would have been to run an ad during the regulation game. Icon Media Direct handled the buy. The 30-second spot was cut from a 60-second version that had been running elsewhere in recent months. A bilingual version also aired on Fox Deportes during overtime. But neither would have run (such as during postgame) had it not been for the overtime, the spokeswoman said. Student-loan refinancer Sofi, which also had an ad in the game, made a similar overtime option buy for the Super Bowl and "got a great price," a spokesman for the brand said in an email. "You can imagine what our group text thread looked like in the fourth quarter as the game got close!" he said. The ad was made in a week, in-house, using photos and videos members sent during the company's #WhyISoFi contest. It follows the brand's first appearance in the game last year. For more on Fox's overtime windfall check out Ad Age's report from earlier this week. With the Super Bowl over, Valentine's Day marketing is heating up. Zipcar is trying to crank up the passion early by promoting next weekend as"#MAKEorBREAKweekend." According to a survey by the car-sharing marketer, "more than half of Americans ages 18-34 feel that the first day or overnight trip is a good test of a new relationship." So Zipcar says it wants to encourage new couples to "put their relationships to the test with their first day or overnight trips together" and give them the chance to "make it or break it before getting into the potentially messy gray area of Feb. 14." The campaign is getting paid support on Facebook, where Zipcar is posing questions like the one below: Credit: Walker & Co. Meantime, Walker & Co.'s Bevel is launching a digital campaign today in advance of Valentine's Day featuring black gay couples celebrating love. "Valentine's Day is an opportunity to celebrate love," said Cassidy Blackwell, brand marketing lead for Walker & Co. "Our goal at Walker & Co. is to build brands for people of color, which in and of itself is a very diverse community." Besides its original subscription business for men's razors and grooming products, including an electric trimmer launched last year, the brand's expansion into outside retailers has continued with last fall's rollout to Amazon, after the brand moved into Target stores in 2015. Who says you can't innovate around soap? Procter & Gamble Co. has just launched a new "Duos" form for its Olay, Old Spice and Ivory brands, and showering may never be quite the same. Liquid body wash has been edging bar soap out of showers for years. But Duos are something different, neither bar soap nor liquid. Kind of like mushy soap, or Play-Doh. Duos are described by Teen Vogue as a "souped up Scotch-Brite sponge" shaped like a Smucker's Uncrustable with a "cleansing dough" inside. It does away with the need for a loofah or washcloth, with packs containing a 30-day supply of the soapy dough. Credit: Broo.com Men's grooming has been growing in recent years, though not as fast as some marketers would like, particularly in the U.S. as opposed to Europe. A new mashup with a faster-growing category -- craft beer -- can only help. The Broo Craft Beer collection of men's grooming products has made it big time now with a launch into Walmart stores and Walmart.com, Drug Store News reports. Onto food marketing: A new Taco Bell ad looks to get real about morningtime. It kicks off like a typical breakfast product spot, with sunshine streaming through the bedroom window. There's even a jingle. But the guy who wakes up doesn't smell coffee brewing in his kitchen and isn't chipper. He must respond to work emails and deal with the typical morning moments that likely keeps him from eating a full breakfast. While at first the Taco Bell song sounds like a standard relaxing tune, it is not all bright and cheery. "When your morning is hell, just go to Taco Bell," the Mexican fast feeder proclaims in the song, which is also set to run on radio. Chief Marketing Officer Marisa Thalberg said the idea of the latest breakfast ad is one of realistic sincerity. "We're in on this with you, we get it," she said, noting that Taco Bell does not want to create a false representation of modern morning routines, such as sitting down and eating breakfast at the kitchen table in robes. The current spot ends with a mention of the chain's $1 grilled breakfast burrito. The work, from Deutsch, comes three years after the national launch of Taco Bell's breakfast menu. "There's a big group that's really open to it, it's just not top of mind yet," Ms. Thalberg said. "We haven't built a Taco Bell breakfast habit." Restaurants including Panera and Chipotle are not the only brands playing up their use of fresh ingredients. After 2015's "All to the Table" campaign, Stouffer's is now using quick online videos to promote the idea of coming together over frozen lasagna. The campaign from Swift, "It's What's on the Inside that Counts," plays up the packaged food marketer's use of real ingredients by showing real families and friends. According to the Nestle brand, the three stories were unscripted. The people featured are a family in which the father recently returned home from military service; a trio of friends in New York including a married gay couple; and a family in which the wife and husband both work different shifts in an emergency room. The spots are currently running as pre-roll ads and will appear in 30-second versions as well. Plans include running on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and the brand's site, plus additional content made for Pinterest and Twitter. Fiat Chrysler -- which went all-in on its Alfa Romeo brand for Super Bowl -- is going country for its Ram brand. The auto marketer has struck a programming deal with Viacom's CMT network for a March 31 special called "CMT Hometown Heroes." It will feature Chris Stapleton, Darius Rucker and Brett Eldredge "as they make surprise returns to their hometowns to give back and perform for their very own hometown heroes," according to CMT. Turning to financial services: Consumers can look out for a fresh campaign later this year from Fifth Third Bank. The Cincinnati-based regional lender has just tapped Pereira & O'Dell as its creative agency of record. The news follows Fifth Third's recent appointment of Empower MediaMarketing as its media agency of record. The 158-year-old bank, which worked with Leo Burnett on a campaign last year, will reveal new marketing, including TV, radio, digital and out-of-home, in May. Lastly, MillerCoors -- which this week hired Publicis Media to handle media buying and planning -- is sticking with MDC Partners-owned Team Enterprises for experiential marketing and retail sampling. The agency, which has been with the brewer roughly two decades, kept the business following a review Contributing: Jack Neff, Jessica Wohl,, E.J.

Roz Edward, Michigan Chronicle Managing Editor Leave a comment 8 reads Insecure actress Yvonne Orji is set to star in an ad celebrating black beauty in Hollywood that will be aired during the NAACP Image Awards on Saturday. Yvonne, who plays the beloved character Molly on the hit HBO series, is also nominated for an Image Award for her supporting role. The ad that will be featured on Saturday is in part of Proctor & Gamble’s “My Black Is Beautiful” campaign. Happy Black History Month! To celebrate, I'm partnering with @MBIB in an exciting way!

The Nigerian-American beauty will talk about the evolution of black beauty in Hollywood and will also talk about her own journey in being black and beautiful, which hasn’t always been an easy one. But she’s learned to embrace her beautiful skin tone and coveted features of full lips and awesome smile. She tells Elle magazine, “My actual desire is to be able to comfortably walk out of my house without any makeup on and feel as beautiful as I do when my makeup artist beats my face. … I’ll probably always opt for makeup because I just like the way it feels. You can play with it and create different looks, and I think that’s fun. But I also want the option to not need it. I think that’s what life is about, just having the options to or not to do.” Be sure to stay on the lookout for Yvonne’s commercial during the NAACP Image Awards which will air February 11th on TV One.

Becky Schilling If you’re looking to combat deflation and set your store up to meet the demands of the future, health and beauty may be your best bet. That was the finding of new research conducted by FMI. Take the case of Sephora and Ulta, urged Chris Skyers, VP of corporate merchandising for Wakefern, who said customers were looking for a high-end place for beauty products that they couldn’t find elsewhere. “You have to go back to moving with your shopper. Health and beauty has lacked vision of moving with shoppers,” Skyers said at a session during FMI’s Midwinter conference in January. “Consumers think there is a better value on HBC items outside of grocery, which isn’t true,” said Lisa Paley of Pfizer Consumer Healthcare. “We need to do a better job at marketing that. Talk differently to the shoppers already in your stores.” Changing the conversation around health and beauty items isn’t necessarily as easy as it sounds, Skyers said. “We’re first a food company, so we aren’t the experts in HB; that’s where the manufacturers come in.” Skyers suggested retailers tap into manufacturer knowledge to help educate and market health and beauty products correctly to consumers. For example, he looked at research that shows young women drop out of sports when they go through puberty. Skyers said Wakefern is working with Procter & Gamble to help educate young girls on products that can help them during this time. Another challenge regarding health and beauty is getting consumers to look to traditional grocery stores as their place of purchase. As Gen Z moves older their baskets will decrease and Millennials tend to shop multiple outlets for their needs, decreasing the likelihood of their purchasing health and beauty in grocery. The key is to make supermarkets the go-to place for health and beauty. One way to ensure this is to make sure staffers working within those aisles are knowledgeable in that area. It seems simple enough, but taking a talented employee from one area of the store and plopping her into health and beauty often results in poor performance. Skyers said retailers could take advantage of growth in health and beauty sales by employing beauty ambassadors in the aisles to help answer questions for customers. Another challenge is simply getting shoppers through the health and beauty aisles. “Ninety-five percent of purchase decisions are made on auto pilot — just trying to get the job done,” said Jane Novak-Cool of Procter & Gamble. “In 2011 almost 50% of shoppers went down all or most aisles — by 2015 it was 40%. So how do you disrupt them to get them outside of normal sections so they know you have these items?” Skyers also urged retailers to think about the health and beauty aisle as an extension of taking care of the community. “We know from a healthcare standpoint these consumers are facing more challenges. There are fewer doctors in community. No one has better opportunity to take care of these shoppers than grocery. We already have what they need to take care of themselves in the food. How do you take the current food portfolio you have and make it a better health portfolio?” Wakefern is trying to stake its ground in this area by employee 140 dietitians in its stores to help educate customers on healthy diets. “The No. 1 reason for hospital readmittance is poor diet. How can grocery help educate and provide for those consumers?” TAGS: The New Consumer 0 comments Hide comments Comment * More information about text formats Text format CommentsPlain text Comments Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p> Plain text No HTML tags allowed.

(AMZN) Stock Is More Valuable Than You Think Why Sprint Corp (S) Stock Is Worth at Least 50% More Recent Posts: Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD) Stock Rockets 30% Higher. Ditch It! Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is More Valuable Than You Think Why Sprint Corp (S) Stock Is Worth at Least 50% More View All Posts The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) stock provides a play for contrarians heading into its fourth-quarter earnings report. Earnings and sales have declined year-over-year in each of the last six quarters, which should keep expectations low. Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts appear to be exiting KO stock en masse. Source: Leo Hidalgo via Flickr (Modified) Morgan Stanley cut Coca-Cola stock to ‘Equal Weight’ in December; Goldman Sachs downgraded KO to ‘Sell’ last month and Wells Fargo followed with its own re-rating to Neutral barely a week later. For investors who like to buy at the point of maximum pessimism, the Coca-Cola earnings report looks like an opportunity. Of course, KO stock isn’t likely to make a huge gain off of the Coca-Cola earnings report; the stock generally doesn’t move all that much. In fact, the relatively quiet movement in Coca-Cola stock actually has been one reason analysts have turned bearish. Those analysts argue that in a more optimistic market, with broad indexes at all-time highs, KO stock’s “defensive” nature seems less attractive. Thus, investors are “rotating” away from safe, solid names like Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) into higher-risk, higher-reward issues. Perhaps this is true, but that argument only works as long as broad markets remain at or near their highs. And for Q4, that pessimism seems to leave KO stock well-positioned for gains coming out of its report. When expectations are low, after all, it’s difficult to disappoint. But the Q4 report also has long-term implications. It will be the first earnings release after the appointment of new CEO James Quincey. Quincey isn’t new to Coca-Cola; he has worked at the company for twenty years. And outgoing CEO Muhtar Kent doesn’t leave until May. But the Q4 earnings call might give Quincey a chance to detail the company’s plans to deal with consumer shifts away from soda. Those plans may be of more interest to investors in KO stock than the Q4 numbers. The KO Stock Numbers Analyst consensus projects KO stock will generate fourth-quarter earnings of $0.38, down a penny year-over-year. Revenue is expected to decline sharply, falling 8.7% year-over-year. Those estimates aren’t quite as bad as they sound, however. The strong dollar is affecting revenue: it reduced Q3 revenue by 2%, for instance. Coca-Cola also has refranchised bottling operations, which has affected revenue. In the third quarter, for instance, reported revenue was down 7%. But the company’s figure of ‘organic’ revenue — growth excluding divested operations and currency effects — rose 3%. KO is still targeting over $600 million in productivity savings this year. And KO also has brought in nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars in proceeds from the refranchising proceeds. The cost savings and cash inflow are being used in part to fund new marketing, but also are improving margins. And if Coca-Cola earnings show further margin improvements, and a surprise earnings beat that shows some bottom-line growth, the narrative here could change. With analysts pricing in a declining business, any sort of growth in Q4 could provide a nice boost to KO stock.

Ascential CEO Duncan Painter and MediaLink Chairman-CEO Michael Kassan. Credit: MediaLink Most Popular When the parent company of the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, the London-based Ascential, said on Tuesday that it has agreed to acquire MediaLink, an influential consultancy in media and advertising, many people wondered exactly what the deal meant. Aggressive expansion seems to be one answer, based on an interview with Ascential CEO Duncan Painter and MediaLink Chairman-CEO Michael Kassan, who will continue in his role. The deal is valued at up to $207 million. A big part of MediaLink's business is making connections. It is handling Mattel's review for its $150 million media business and is involved in the search for a new president-CEO of the 4A's, the main trade association for ad agencies. IT also frequently brings people and companies together on a smaller scale. The deal will help it capitalize on events like the Cannes Lions as it does that, the executives suggested, while Cannes Lions capitalizes on MediaLink's "connectivity" in the same way. But the connections game is a high-touch effort. MediaLink and Ascential also offer information services that they believe can complement each other. "Whilst the human capital is critically important," Mr. Kassan said, "the opportunity to industrialize that is something we can benefit greatly from." On all fronts, global expansion is the goal. "MediaLink serves about 200-plus companies around the world," Ascential CEO Duncan Painter said. "We serve 24,000, so we want to get MediaLink in with their business model through all the the applicable businesses and clients that we work with and expand them globally so they have a great footprint in all the countries that we operate in today, which is 160 that we trade in and 16 that we have critical mass in." Read the full interview: Advertising Age: When people hear Ascential, they tend to only think of the Cannes Lions. Can you explain more about the information services division? Duncan Painter: The division is made up of effectively six primary brands that are large scale information services subscription products. They also provide brand advisory and consultancy services around what they do. The biggest brand that would be known in North America and the biggest brand in our group is WGSN, which is the fashion trend forecasting information platform. For any consumer products that are considered fashionable -- from apparel through mobile phone manufacturers, like Apple and Samsung to car manufacturers -- use the information services platform for informational forecasts that set out what's going to be fashionable for consumers two years from now and what consumers will be using. It's a product that's an access of $100 million in revenue, but it's all subscriptions. The second biggest product in that area is called One Click Retail, which is a subscription information service that basically allows its end brands consumers, so those like Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Colgate and Mondelez, to effectively monitor their sales and shares on Amazon in comparison to their competitors. Ad Age: How did the deal come about? Michael Kassan: As we started to develop a conversation over the past months with Ascential, we saw the opportunity to dial up our piece of it into the information services part of the business. There's a lot we can do in terms of the productization, digitization and industrialization of our service offering. A service business is one of those things that is more about human capital and what we're trying to say that whilst the human capital is critically important, the opportunity to industrialize that is something we can benefit greatly from and that's something that Ascential certainly has expertise with. The other piece in which we first engaged with Ascential is obviously with the event side of our business. The event strategy and tactical part of our business is a very important piece of what some of our clients look for, but it's a manifestation of what we do in terms of connectivity. We try to find opportunities to bring people together in an efficient way, and places like the Cannes Lions and Money 20/20, do it in that way. Our ability to capitalize on that and bring our unique selling proposition against those tent pole events is something we see as a great extension of our existing business line. The opportunity to have Ascential in the role of information and us in the role of connectivity is a perfect marriage of what each of us do really well. Ad Age: Why buy MediaLink in particular? Mr. Painter: It's a hard-headed support of clients that brings the two businesses together to really provide them a best-in-class, most-informed service to let them make core decisions around how and who to operate and work with going forward to get the best results. At the end of the day, the brand customers we serve never had a more difficult market in which to operate in. They're facing massive transitions themselves, from big box traditional retail or distribution through larger retail operations into online and marketplace transitions. They're trying to establish brands where the retail operations they're serving are contracting. They're trying to balance all that by getting more efficiency into their products and dealing with global economic and political changes that are driving all kinds of pressures through inflation and non-inflation and exchange rates, so executing success has never been harder. We believe the information we provide to brands across all of our platforms, plus the unique information we can capture and make available through Cannes Lions and deliver to MediaLink, really does ensure that between the two of us, we can partner with our clients and give them deep information to make sure they're maximizing their performance this year and the next year. It will also ensure that they're spending money with the right kind of partners to deliver great business results for themselves and great return on their marketing and sales expenses. Ad Age: What's the strategic advantage for MediaLink? Mr. Kassan: For MediaLink, what it means is a validation of our business model and an understanding that we can take it the next level with geographic growth alongside Ascential. For our people it's a celebration of a job well done and a clear picture of the job we have in front of us to continue to make a difference in this marketplace and continue to find opportunities to capitalize on the change, as well as the chaos and disruption. When I say capitalize, I don't mean it in a pejorative way, but in an extremely positive way because I think it's okay to be opportunistic if in the context that you can serve a greater good for the industry. There's never been a time where this industry has been more disrupted and going through massive change in terms of the players around the table and how they find their value and satisfy the needs of their clients and customers, and we think we can help in that. Ad Age: How about the strategic advantage for Ascential? Mr. Painter: From our side, it's really easy. MediaLink has a great business model. It's a very well-run business with great leadership. Simply what we want to do is what we do with all of our brands, which is to expand. MediaLink serves about 200-plus companies around the world. We serve 24,000, so we want to get MediaLink in with their business model through all the the applicable businesses and clients that we work with and expand them globally so they have a great footprint in all the countries that we operate in today, which is 160 that we trade in and 16 that we have critical mass in. And we want to get them to expand their products and services into other areas of business support and brands and fashion organizations where we already have great strengths but where we can see their business model has high applicability. We can see great opportunity for MediaLink's growth worldwide, but more importantly, great opportunity to better serve our customers and brands. Ad Age: We spoke earlier about the line between the information services side of Ascential's business and the event side, so does this deal mean that MediaLink, which is largely known for its networking and connectivity, won't be doing those types of events and activities anymore? Mr. Kassan: No, absolutely not. We think that's going to be something that is stepped up. We've built that presence in Cannes, as well as CES. The connectivity that MediaLink is famous for is very core to our business and we think the opportunity to plug into some of the clients that we don't work with and some of the other opportunities that Ascential will present to us, if anything, are additive and accretive to both sides. Ad Age: Are there any areas that Ascential wants to grow through its relationship with MediaLink? Mr. Painter: We see huge areas that the MediaLink business model and the work that they do can immediately transition into a lot of the fashion brands we work with and a lot of the goods manufacturers around consumer products that we're supporting and working with in the design space. We think there's an awful lot of work that MediaLink does on the marketing side that can easily transpose into those areas. Secondly, a big area of growth that our brands are demanding from us is how we help them activate and execute on go-to-market strategies and marketplace platforms, Amazon being the prime example. We're certainly looking across all the client relationships we have there to ask MediaLink to expand out and provide further services using our tool sets and insights to help brands really help activate their sales and drive faster sales growth for many of those businesses on platforms like Amazon, but also Jet.

MARKETING Big Brands Unwittingly Fund Terrorism and White Supremacy Via Digital Ads The speed and convenience of digital ads can't be matched. Neither can potentially disastrous consequences. By Erik Sherman Erik Sherman's work has appeared in such publications as The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times Magazine, and Fortune. He also writes at Fortune.com and Forbes.com. @ErikSherman Contributor, Inc.com@ErikSherman WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Digital ads have been creating some new types of problems for brands over the past few years. Bots and fraud have siphoned away ad dollars while providing no value. Some high-profile sites found their target could be tagged as "adult and inappropriate," resulting in the loss of ad revenue. Then there's the whole question of how many influencer marketers have fake followings, wasting the money they receive from brands. Well, things are worse than we thought. A new study by the Times of London found that some big brands saw their names paired with terrorism and white supremacy content. And other developments show that the level of ad fraud is even higher than once believed. Just when you thought that online ads were a help to your bottom line, you find they're supporting a bottomless pit of problems. The Times piece minced no words: Advertisements for hundreds of large companies, universities and charities, including Mercedes-Benz, Waitrose and Marie Curie, appear on hate sites and YouTube videos created by supporters of terrorist groups such as Islamic State and Combat 18, a violent pro-Nazi faction. The practice is likely to generate tens of thousands of pounds a month for extremists. An advert appearing alongside a YouTube video, for example, typically earns whoever posts the video $7.60 for every 1,000 views. Some of the most popular extremist videos have more than one million hits. Ugly appearances An example was Sandals Resorts, whose ad appeared next to video for Shabab, the East African branch of al Qaeda. White supremacist group promotional videos were paired with ads for Honda, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and Thomson Reuters, among others. Google took down some of the videos and provided the Times with the following statement: When it comes to content on YouTube, we remove flagged videos that break our rules and have a zero tolerance policy for content that incites violence or hatred. Some content on YouTube may be controversial and offensive, which is why we only allow advertising against videos which fall within our advertising guidelines. Our partners can also choose not to appear against content they consider inappropriate, and we have a responsibility to work with the industry to help them make informed choices. Concern about being paired with content an advertiser considers inappropriate is an old problem. But it used to be more easily controlled, as media buyers would indicate preferences and demands and the human beings that laid out publications accommodated them. However, online advertising is driven by automated buying and placement. Mistakes can happen more easily and, given the vast nature of the display landscape, more readily escape detection. Then there's ad fraud You assume no ill will on the part of anyone when it comes to inappropriate ad pairing. But the problems with ad fraud and scamming have grown precipitously. According to a report by ZDNet security writer Zack Whittaker, Google had a problem this week with spoofed Amazon ads appearing in its search results. The good news is that unlike other rogue ads, your machine wasn't infected or served malware in any way. But anyone who clicked on it would not have been sent to Amazon.com as they would have hoped, but instead, they were pointed to a fake Windows support scam posing as Microsoft. From there, scammers would have tried to trick the user into calling a number for fear that their computer was in fact infected with malware. Google allegedly told ZDNet that it does not comment on individual ads. I have a request in for comments on both situations and will update this post with any additional information. And there's an even bigger problem: the general questionable nature of digital ad placements, period. In a speech at an Interactive Advertising Bureau event, Marc Pritchard, chief brand officer for Procter & Gamble, while having some praise for the potential of digital ads and the possibility for "magnificent works of craft," talked of a "dark side" and said, "At the same time, we've seen an exponential increase in, well, crap." "We serve ads to consumers through a nontransparent media supply chain with spotty compliance to common standards, unreliable measurement, hidden rebates, and new inventions like bots and methbot fraud," Pritchard said. P&G will stop paying for digital ads that don't meet its standards. P&G claims to be the largest advertiser in the world. Even if not, it's a giant, and it's likely you'll see other big companies start to actively reassess digital ads and what they're getting from them. Entrepreneurs need to find ways to do the same. Don't meekly accept claims of where your ads appear. Digital should be easily traceable. Demand proof. Run tests to see how much benefit you get. Put your budget into high-quality sites that have shown value and reach your audience. Turning your eyes from scamming as part of the price of a cheap campaign does you no good and wastes your money.

(AMD) Stock? Wait for a Pullback Recent Posts: Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI) Stock Soars on Revenue Growth, Buybacks Why Twitter Inc (TWTR), Coty Inc (COTY) and Cabelas Inc (CAB) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Socks the Shorts With the Model 3 View All Posts Investors looking for a reason — any reason — to buy stocks today didn’t have to look very hard; reports that last week’s unemployment claims reached a 12-week low provided more than enough inspiration. The S&P 500 advanced 0.58% to end the trading session at 2,307.87, tiptoeing into record-high territory. Not every name jumped on the bullish bandwagon, though. Cabelas Inc (NYSE:CAB), Coty Inc (NYSE:COTY) and Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR) all pulled back in the wake of concerning news. Here’s what went wrong for each. Twitter Inc (TWTR) Any lingering hope that microblogging website Twitter was going to figure out how to drive sustainable growth was largely wiped away today. For the 10th straight quarter in a row, year-over-year revenue growth slumped … and that wasn’t even the worst of it. The good news is, the company’s profit of 16 cents per share handily topped estimates for earnings of only 12 cents per share of TWTR. The bad news is, the GAAP loss of $167.1 million widened from the loss of $90.2 million in the same quarter a year earlier. Total revenue was up a scant 1% to $717.2 million, falling short of the $740.1 million analysts were expecting. There was one key missing element from Thursday morning’s Q4 report — Twitter didn’t divulge how many daily active users (DAU) it measured for the quarter ending in December. Most observers assume this is an indication that the number didn’t grow at all for the quarter in question. TWTR ended the day down 12.3%. Coty Inc (COTY) TWTR wasn’t the only name to get slammed following a disappointing quarterly report. Cosmetics company Coty saw its stock take a tumble to the tune of 8.6% after posting its fiscal Q2 numbers this morning. The organization turned in an operating profit 30 cents per share on revenue of $2.3 billion. Both missed expectations for earnings of 36 cents per share of COTY and sales of $2.38 billion. New Coty CEO Camillo Pane commented on the results: “Consistent with our comments on the last earnings call, Q2 was a challenging quarter. The business was impacted by significantly higher-than-anticipated inventory levels in the market on the acquired P&G Beauty Business, competitive pressure in the Consumer Beauty division and the distraction associated with the merger integration efforts.” Cabelas Inc (CAB) Last but not least, when the deal was announced back in October, sporting goods store chain Bass Pro Shops didn’t expect it would have any regulatory trouble acquiring a rival retailer Cabelas. Now it’s not so sure. Yesterday evening, Bass Pro Shops disclosed that the Federal Trade Commission was requesting more information about the impending deal. Such a request does not inherently mean the FTC intends to prevent the union for happening. It does, however, understandably result in some raised eyebrows. The government watchdog has generally been leaning anti-merger of late, so this request for more details certainly doesn’t say the Federal Trade Commission is willing to sweep it through without thoroughly scrutinizing it first. With the $5.5 billion deal perhaps now in jeopardy, investors sent CAB shares 5.3% lower on Thursday, to a close of $50.24. Bass Pro Shops’ offer was a price of $65.50 per share. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

LONDON, Feb. 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Global Oleate Esters Market: Overview Oleate Esters are known as the esters or salts of oleic acids. Esters are synthesized by the reaction between alcohol and oleic acids in presence of catalysts. They are obtained from natural sources such as animal fats and vegetable oils, most preferably palm oil, canola oil, soybean oil, etc. As they are obtained from natural raw materials, they are preferred over other chemical compounds. Generally, oleate esters are manufactured using natural resources such as vegetable oils and animal fats as their raw materials. Besides, the demand for oleate esters is expected to rise in future as well due to rapid rate of industrialization as well as awareness among the consumers regarding the benefits of using them. Due to these reasons, manufacturers are looking for alternative raw materials which can be used as substitutes instead of the conventional natural raw materials. By utilizing chemicals it would be easier to obtain oleate esters at a large scale. The market is expected to experience constant change as a result of improvement in the techniques involved in the manufacturing processes. Due to the constant changes in the market, there can be improvements in the standard and quality of oleate esters, which in turn would change the dynamics of the market.

The company currently sells a range of manual and electric toothbrushes in India.PTI | Feb 9, 2017, 06.00 PM IST New Delhi, Feb 7 () Oral healthcare brand Oral-B has launched a range of electric rechargeable toothbrushes, priced Rs 3,800 onwards as it looks to expand its position in the niche but growing segment. The company currently sells a range of manual and electric toothbrushes in India. "We're proud to introduce our new electric toothbrushes, including the Oral-B Pro 2000 in India with Oscillating, Rotating, Pulsating (ORP) technology. Its unique oscillating, rotating and pulsating action moves up to 48,800 times removing up to a 100 per cent more plaque vs a regular brush," Oral-B R&D Expert Phillip Hundeshagen said in a statement. This results in significantly better oral health for consumers, he added. Part of the Procter & Gamble Company, Oral-B is a global leader in the over USD 5 billion global brushing market. According to industry estimates, the powered toothbrush market in India is at a nascent stage pegged at about USD 1 million, while the manual toothbrush market is estimated to be at USD 450 million. The two products -- PRO 600 and PRO 2000 -- will be available on Amazon.in for Rs 3,800 and Rs 5,800, respectively. The cost of two heads (which are replaced at intervals) of Oral-B powered toothbrush is Rs 955. The toothbrush comes equipped with visible pressure sensor that lights up to alert users when they are brushing too hard and an on-handle timer that buzzes every 30 seconds to inform when it's time to focus on brushing the next quadrant of the mouth. It has two modes - daily clean and gum care (massage mode for gentle stimulation of gums). SR SBT MKJ Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

Both Bansal and Sarup were roped in about a year back by the SoftBank-backed firm, which is locked in an intense battle for leadership with US-based Uber. According to sources, Pallav Singh, who is currently Senior Vice President and Head of Ola Money, has been given the additional responsibility as interim CFO. Sarup's replacement is yet to be decided, they added. Emailed queries to the company did not elicit a response. Earlier today, Ola named Badri Raghavan as its chief data scientist. The development comes amid Japan's SoftBank booking an investment loss of 39.28 billion yen (USD 350 million) on its investments in India, including those in Ola and e-commerce company Snapdeal. Ola has been witnessing a slew of changes in its executive team. Last month, Ola had roped in former PepsiCo executive, Vishal Kaul as its COO. In turn, Pranay Jivrajka -- who was also Ola's first employee -- was elevated as Founding Partner. A former Infosys executive, Bansal had joined Ola last year. He is also in the midst of a controversy as some of the Infosys founders have raised concerns about the severance package offered to him. Sarup, who also joined Ola in January last year, was previously working as Managing Director of Microsoft India. He has worked across companies like Nokia, Yum! Brands (Pizza Hut) and Procter & Gamble. Meanwhile, Dr. Badri Raghavan,a seasoned data scientist with over 20 years of extensive domain experience, has been appointed as Ola's Chief Data Scientist with key responsibilities to lead a Data Science team with cutting edge training in machine learning, artificial intelligence, decision analysis, pattern recognition and related areas. This team will work across various business units and departments, to gain operational and business efficiencies, ranging from demand and supply prediction, driver behavior and performance management, location Intelligence, to name a few. #Cfo rajiv bansal quit#Cmo raghuvesh sarup quit#Infosys#Ola#Softbank Also See SoftBank loses $350 million on investments in Snapdeal, Ola Three reasons why Bangalore's curbs on Uber, Ola pooling are regressive -- while it woos not-so-hot Apple Vishal Sikka asks employees not to get distracted by speculations about governance, integrity Pune Infosys techie found dead; police yet to apprehend suspects Top Stories Uttar Pradesh Election 2017 LIVE: Western UP records 45% voter turnout till 2 pm; Mayawati claims BSP will win 1st phase PM Modi Likes 'Peeping into Bathrooms': Rahul on Raincoat Jibe MSG Lion Heart 2 'review': Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh launches another surgical strike on cinema Women scientists in India: What we learnt from a year of lab-hopping across the country Why you should prepay home loan now & ensure long term saving 'False rape' cases: Is the feeling of being cheated something that can be explained in our laws?

The global aerosol market is expected to witness growth primarily due to growing use in personal care and household applications. These together accounts for the lion share of the application market and are expected to witness growth in line with the end use industries. Global aerosol market growth is primarily dependent on demand dynamics in applications including personal care, household, paints, medical and others including food, automotive and adhesives. Browse the report: http://www.orbisresearch.com/reports/index/aerosol-market-analysis-by-application-personal-care-household-paint-medical-and-segment-forecasts-to-2020 Personal care was the largest application segment in 2013 owing to new product development in Europe and North America coupled with increasing cosmetics demand from Asia Pacific and Latin America. The segment had an estimated demand of over 6.0 billion units in 2013 and consists of products including deodorant, hair care and body care. Further key findings from the study suggest: Global aerosol demand was estimated at 14.61 billion units in 2013 and is expected to exceed 18.0 billion units by 2020, growing at a CAGR of 3.1% from 2014 to 2020.

Asia Pacific is expected to be the fastest growing regional market due to relaxed regulatory scenario and high demand for cosmetics and household products. The region is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2014 to 2020. Growing use of personal care products such as deodorants and shaving creams among younger population in emerging markets including India and China is expected to have major impact on market growth.

Matthew North, Commercial Director at Kelheim Fibres said that together with the local wastewater authorities and renowned pump manufacturer WILO, comprehensive tests on products containing Viloft were conducted in 2016. They wanted to go one step beyond the requirements of the flushabilty guidelines and see what actually happens in practice – that is to say down in the sewage system. In contrast to traditional (spunlace) wipes, which led to clogging and blocked pumps, wipes made of Viloft have passed the test with flying colours. Furthermore, their close cooperation with the wastewater authorities has made clear to them how much damage to the sewage systems is really caused by incorrectly disposed wet wipes. The increased maintenance costs amount to almost 200 Mio € per year in Germany alone – and, at the end of the day, these costs are paid by the consumer. In addition to their rapid disintegration, which eases the load on the pumps, wet wipes made of Viloft and wood pulp are compostable: they consist of 100% cellulose and are fully biodegradable, the company reports. Hygienic fibres remain another important topic for the manufacturer of viscose fibres for the tampon industry. The company’s patented, extra absorbent speciality fibre Galaxy, high hygiene standards, as well as a deep understanding of customers’ needs enable long-lasting peer-to-peer partnerships, the manufacturer explains. The company recently received an External Business Partner Excellence Award 2016 from P&G. Kelheim Fibres’ in-house R&D has also developed a new fibre named Electra, which can be used in a wide range of applications for the dissipation of static charges. Currently, Kelheim is testing the possible use of this fibre in connection with sensitive electronic components. Approximately 90,000 tons of viscose fibres are produced and tested every year at Kelheim in South Germany. Its viscose fibre products are used in widely diverse applications ranging from fashion, hygiene and medical products, to the nonwovens industry. Kelheim Fibres is focused on developing innovative products, flexible technologies and strong customer orientation, as well as active environmental protection. 0 YarnsandFibers News Bureau Irani to discuss issues faced by silk sector Rich Indian textile heritage to go global View All...

After floods destroyed thousands of houses in West Virginia, local vocational high school students started constructing 500-square-foot replacements. 01 /10 Twelve classrooms across the state collaborated to design and build 15 unique tiny homes, each no larger than 500 square feet. 02 /10 One school in the state’s eastern panhandle now has a contract with Habitat for Humanity and Proctor & Gamble. 03 /10 That will funnel $75,000 into the construction of at least three more homes. 04 /10 The tiny homes are not meant to be permanent replacements for homes lost in the flood. 05 /10 But people can keep them if they like them. 06 /10 A couple of the homes were designed so walls could be removed and built out into a larger structure. 07 /10 The plan is to develop a suite of tiny homes "that could be stored and rolled out right after a disaster.” 08 /10 Families could then choose to keep the home... 09 /10 or the tiny house could be returned, refurbished, and repurposed when the next disaster strikes. 10 /10 It’s a promising model for disaster relief, but also for how technical education should work.

Scotland Is Taking Over The Country's Ferries And Creating A National Ferry Service Fox News Just Made The Head Of ISIS Look Like A Pretty Decent Guy Another Reason To Let Kids Play Outside: Staying Indoors Could Cause Bad Vision Eillie Anzilotti 02.08.17 1:30 PM Last June, flooding of an unprecedented scale struck West Virginia, leaving at least 23 dead and destroying around 5,000 homes. One of the uprooted was Brenda Rivers, a retired nurse who had lived in her home in Sinks Grove, right at the banks of the Greenbriar River, for 18 years. When the water levels began to rise, Rivers piled into her camper van with her dog and cat, and parked in her neighbors’ driveway for a few days. She returned to find six inches of solid mud lining the floor of her house. At first, Rivers told West Virginia Public Broadcasting, she thought she could just hose it off and move back in. But the whole foundation was destroyed, and the mud had hardened into a sort of concrete that was impossible to remove. Because she couldn’t find a short-term rental that she could afford and that would accept pets, Rivers drove her camper van to her daughter’s house in Alderson and has been living there ever since. But with five homeschooled children running around, she can’t imagine staying. "It’s too chaotic," she said. Rivers is one of many West Virginians who struggled to put down new roots after the historic floods. Though the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was on hand to provide cash assistance for repairs or temporary housing, the up to $33,000 in assistance is intended "to get you back on your feet, but we cannot make you whole again," FEMA deputy director Mike Senycz told West Virginia Metro News. A new housing relief program launched in West Virginia’s network of vocational schools is giving people like Rivers a more personal—and potentially permanent—place to live. As the chief officer of career technical education (CTE) for the West Virginia Department of Education, Kathy D’Antoni had watched high school students leave school "just lacking basic job-readiness skills, like commitment and preparedness." Around five years ago, she piloted the Simulated Workplace program in 80 CTE classrooms across the state, with the idea that each class would be run like an actual company that students lead and operate. The program has since expanded to over 500 classrooms. When the floods hit, D’Antoni tells Co.Exist that she saw an opportunity for the students to put their skills to work assisting the community. Schools participating in the Simulated Workplace program receive around $20,000 each year from the West Virginia Board of Education; instead of funneling that money into supplies for building things like bird cages or dog houses, D’Antoni says, she decided to set the students a larger task: To construct a group of tiny homes for people displaced by the floods. Twelve classrooms across the state collaborated to design and build 15 unique tiny homes, each no larger than 500 square feet (for contrast, the average American home is around 2,500 square feet). "Instead of setting kids a project that they would then tear up or throw away or never use, we gave them the project of designing these homes," D’Antoni says. "It’s really leveraging state dollars for a cause." The original plan was for the homes to be delivered to the 15 families before Christmas; because local relief agencies needed more time to construct concrete foundations for the home and connect the electricity and sewer systems, the delivery ended up being delayed until mid-January. But the project isn’t stopping at 15 homes. One school in the state’s eastern panhandle now has a contract with Habitat for Humanity and Proctor & Gamble, which will funnel $75,000 into the construction of at least three more homes. Though the tiny homes are not meant to be permanent replacements for homes lost in the flood, D’Antoni says that "they could be if people want." A couple of the homes were designed so walls could be removed and built out into a larger structure. That flexibility is the hallmark of a disaster-relief housing program in Texas, called RAPIDO, which delivers the core of a modular home to residents who lost their homes in six weeks. The core then is gradually built out into a full-sized home. The point of RAPIDO and other prefabricated disaster relief housing (like these low-cost units in Japan) is to prepare for disasters before they hit, and deliver resources quickly, efficiently, and with a degree of permanence. FEMA, which still relies heavily on expensive, temporary trailers in the wake of a disaster, has yet to embrace that model. For West Virginia, D’Antoni imagines students developing a whole fleet of tiny homes, "that could be stored and rolled out right after a disaster." Families could then choose to keep the home, or the tiny house could be returned, refurbished, and repurposed when the next disaster strikes. It’s a promising model for disaster relief, but also, D’Antoni says, for how technical education should work. "It’s a way for kids to contribute to local economic development, but also do good for the community and give back what has been given to them." [Photos: via Simulated Workplace] Never miss a story.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India Elections World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Budget 2017 Photos Video Search Search Home Economy Indian ad industry may not have grown at 17% in CY 2016 as projected The Pitch-Madison Advertisement Report 2016 made bullish estimates but demonetisation came as a bolt from the blue. S V Krishnamachari   February 9, 2017 12:43 IST A man looks at newspapers with cover stories on withdrawal of Indian 500 and 1,000 rupee notes from circulation, on a pavement in Srinagar November 9, 2016.Reuters file Projections of double-digit growth for the fourth straight year in calendar year (CY) 2016 for India's advertisement industry are certain to have taken a hit since demonetisation came from nowhere, disrupting the calculations. The Pitch-Madison Advertisement Report 2016 had estimated that the industry would grow by 16.8 percent to Rs 51,365 crore, with digital poised to grow at the highest clip of 30 percent. Read: Movie goers spent less on tickets, food due to demonetisation, reveal PVR Q3 results  "Our prognosis for 2016 is that it is going to be yet another good year for media. In arriving at the numbers for advertising in each medium, we are conditioned by the fact that the Indian economy has become the fastest growing economy of the world; our GDP growth rate at 7%+ is the envy of the Western world, now looking at India in a new light," the report, released in February last year, had said. "In 2015, the industry grew by 17.6 percent, exceeding our mid-year projections of 13.8 percent. 2016 promises to be yet another high growth year, with the market expected to grow 16.8 percent, notching up an additional Rs 7,300 crore to reach a total size of Rs 51,365 crore," the report added. Among the categories — print, television, outdoor, digital and cinema — the highest rate of growth was projected for digital, at 30 percent, to Rs 6,656 crore. For television, the projection was 20 percent, to Rs 20,713 crore. From a sectoral viewpoint, India's top advertisers in 2015, according to the Pitch-Madison Report 2016, were FMCG, e-commerce, automobile, telecom and real estate, in that order. Among individual advertisers, Hindustan Unilever, Amazon, Procter & Gamble, Flipkart, Maruti Suzuki, Godrej Consumer Products and ITC were the top entities. Print and television account for about 75 percent of the projected Rs 51,365 crore ad revenues for CY 2016, according to the report. For the December 2016 quarter (Q3), HT Media reported 5.7 percent fall in advertisement revenues to Rs 511 crore while Zee Entertainment Enterprises saw its advertisement income grow 3.4 percent in comparison to 27 percent in the corresponding quarter last fiscal. Hindustan Unilever Ltd. marginally cut its ad spend in Q3 to 11.5 percent of net revenues.

Small banks' cyber threats Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank president Patrick Harker has said he is worried about cyber threats to small banks, pointing to hackers stealing money by exploiting third-party vendors that provide cyber security, Reuters reports.  The exec said small banks' main concern is cyber security, according to the report. Rometty's bonus IBM CEO Ginni Rometty has received a $4.95 million payout under her annual incentive plan, the largest since she was named to the top post 2012, Bloomberg reports, citing a company regulatory filing. The bonus was tied to goals for operating net income, operating cash flow and revenue from the company's strategic imperatives, the report said. Rometty received a $4.5 million bonus in 2015. Rometty's target for her bonus and her $1.6 million salary will remain unchanged in fiscal 2017, the filing said. She'll also receive equity awards worth about $13.3 million linked to company financial goals. Congress' privacy vote The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a measure requiring law enforcement to obtain a search warrant before seeking emails or other digital communications older than six months from technology companies, Reuters reports. Both Microsoft and Google have recently challenged the government's power to compel them to turn over emails stored on servers overseas, with the former winning its argument and the latter losing.  Technology companies have pressured Congress for years to pass the Email Privacy Act in order to update the Electronic Communications Privacy Act from 1986. Under current law, federal agencies only need to procure a subpoena to request information from a service provider. Revel's exec shakeup Revel Systems, which has raised more than $130 million and deployed its software in thousands of iPad checkout terminals, has dismissed its two founders and been taken over by one of its major investors, the company has announced. Revel co-founder and CEO Lisa Falzone and co-founder and CTO Chris Ciabarra were bought out of most of their shares by private equity firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, which now has a majority stake in the company, BuzzFeed reports.  Scott Betts, a former Procter & Gamble executive, has been installed as the new CEO. Cologix's Stonepeak deal Cologix, a network neutral interconnection and datacenter operator of 24 facilities in nine markets in North America, has announced that private equity firm Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners has acquired a majority interest in the company. Under terms of the deal, Grant van Rooyen, Cologix CEO and board chairman, will continue to run the company. Existing investors, including van Rooyen, the van Rooyen Group, company management, Columbia Capital and Greenspring Associates will retain a material interest in the company moving forward and will participate in future growth equity investments, Stonepeak said. Additional board members include Trent Vichie, Brian McMullen, Bill Fathers and Peter Bruce from Stonepeak, Patrick Hendy from Columbia and Neil Hobbs of the van Rooyen Group. CompTIA's digital transformation report IT industry trade association CompTIA is offering a new report, entitled Building Digital Organizations, covering the evolving digital transformation that is prompting companies to revise their operation procedures. The report spans new strategic roles of IT departments, new opportunities for IT teams and shared responsibilities among lines of business and IT.  Microsoft's patent trolls Microsoft has said it will make its storehouse of 10,000 patents available free of charge to safeguard cloud developers from potential legal threats mounted against them by patent trolls, Reuters reports. The company also said it will extend its offer to defend any customers sued over Azure to include open source technology incorporated into its cloud service. For example, Microsoft will defend an automaker lacking mobile apps and other cloud-based products, which could make it vulnerable to a lawsuit by a patent entity, the report said. "They haven't had years to build up that patent portfolio," Julia White, Microsoft corporate VP, reportedly told Reuters. "Cloud innovation is far too important to be stifled by lawsuits." CyrusOne's datacenter acquisitions Datacenter operator CyrusOne has announced plans to acquire two datacenters from enterprise datacenter operator and designer Sentinel Datacenters for $490 million. CyrusOne said it will buy a Sentinel datacenter located in the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina and another in Somerset, New Jersey, in moves to boost its presence in the southeast U.S. and reach more customers in the healthcare and financial industries, the company said. With the acquisition, CyrusOne now operates 35 datacenter facilities, 33 of which are located in the U.S. Apple's TV exec Apple has hired Timothy Twerdahl, the former head of Amazon's Fire TV unit, to head its Apple TV product marketing, in a move that could signal the vendor's renewed focus on the platform, Bloomberg reports. Twerdahl will report to Greg Joswiak, an Apple VP in charge of iPhone marketing, the report said. Previous Apple TV marketing VP Pete Distad will now help lead Apple's content initiatives, the report said.

The event, sponsored by Index Exchange, PulsePoint, Tapad and DM Training brings together senior industry thought leaders to discuss and debate solutions to digital media’s toughest challenges – including viewability, brand safety, ad fraud, and transparency. The format of the sessions will be interactive to ensure a two-way dialogue often not seen at other events, and to encourage the development of real solutions for the ongoing challenges of brand safety. The full-day programme will take place at ME London on Thursday, 16th March 2017, beginning with a networking breakfast at 8:00am. The event will feature a full day of content and will conclude with an exclusive networking cocktail hour. Tickets are available for purchase at www.trustyourmedia.co.uk. Digital media leaders speaking at the prestigious event confirmed so far include: Zach Chapman, VP International Sales and Global Digital, ESPN Dominic Carter, Chief Commercial Officer, News UK Paul De La Nougerede, Commercial Product Director, Telegraph Media Group Eduardo Ustaran, Partner, Hogan Lovells International LLP Rob Beeler, Chairman, AdMonsters Mary Keane-Dawson, Managing Director, UK neo@Ogilvy Duncan Tickell, MD Advertising and International, Immediate Media Company Julia Smith, Independent Digital Consultant, The 614 Group The Brand Safety Summit is an educational forum designed to bring together high-level industry thought leaders from all sides of the digital media landscape. They will discuss how to solve the industry’s greatest challenges, which include making money with brand safe inventory, and tackling the growing issues around transparency. Highly topical will be this year’s deep-dive into the world of fake news and how it can impact brand safety as well as a panel session looking at Methbot and non-human traffic. Delegates will also have the chance to learn from inspiring case studies. “The timing for this year’s Brand Safety Summit in London could not be more on target. Between historic elections and political moments like Brexit, the need for clarity around the expectations of advertising are paramount,” said Rob Rasko, CEO, The 614 Group. He continued: “We’re thrilled to have senior leaders from the publishing community, including major media brands such as ESPN, NewsUK and The Telegraph, joining the discussion. The 2017 programme will go back to basics and focus on working together to define what exactly is brand safety. Brands like Proctor and Gamble, who spent $7.2 billion on advertising last year, are becoming more vocal about their media buys. The company’s Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard recently said: ‘We realise there is no sustainable advantage in a complicated, nontransparent, inefficient and fraudulent media supply chain.’ Other brands are sure to follow and there is no better time than now for all sides of our industry to come together to discuss, debate and learn.” The agenda will feature two keynote sessions. The first will be delivered by Eduardo Ustaran, Partner at Hogan Lovells International, and will focus on Brexit. The second will be delivered by Richard Foan, Chair of JICWEBS and Group Executive Director of Communication & Innovation at ABC, who will provide attendees an update on JICWEBS and how it is reacting to the changing needs of the industry for brand safety.

Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here BENGALURU: The most high profile hire made by India's largest cab hailing startup Ola, former Infosys CFO Rajiv Bansal, has quit the company as it continues to see a top management churn. Ola's chief marketing officer Raghuvesh Sarup has also put in his papers, said sources familiar with the matter. Both Bansal and Sarup were roped in one year ago at Softbank backed Ola, which is currently engaged in a tough battle for market share with US-based Uber. Pallav Singh, another early employee who is Senior Vice President and Head of Ola Money, has been given the additional responsibility as interim CFO. No replacement for Sarup has been decided yet. An Ola spokesman declined to comment. The top level churn at Ola comes as the company also moved chief operating officer and first employee Pranay Jivrajka to an undefined role as a founding partner. Bansal, who joined Infosys in 1999, was appointed as the CFO of Infosys in 2012. He was one of the highest paid executives. For the year ending March 2015, Bansal took home a package of $770,858, next only to UB Pravin Rao, the company's chief operating officer and Vishal Sikka, the CEO of Infosys. More recently, Bansal has been in the middle of on going fight between Infosys founders and new CEO Vishal Sikka as his large severance pay of Rs 17.4 crore has come under question. Bansal joined Ola in January 2016, with one of his key mandates to prepare the company for a public listing. Sarup's appointment was also announced in January 2016 as well, before which he was marketing director at Microsoft India. Before this Sarup had worked with Nokia, Yum! Brands (Pizza Hut) and Procter & Gamble. Ola has also been making a slew of new appointments as well this year. Vishal Kaul, former General Manager of PepsiCo Foods for Thailand, Myanmar and Laos, was appointed as Jivrajka's replacement as COO.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 9 February 2017 by Military News Baby Diapers Market Projected to Reach a Valuation of US$52.2 Bn by the end of 2017 The advent of innovative technologies and the constant efforts by the major players to develop new products in the global baby diapers market are projected to grab the attention of the customers. In addition, the modern-day diapers are manufactured and designed as bio-degradable disposable diapers that are mostly environmentally friendly, leading to increased demand for baby diapers in the coming years. Download Research Brochure PDF@ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… The increasing awareness regarding personal hygiene and increasing infant population are the major factors estimated to boost the demand for baby diapers throughout the forecast period. In addition, rapid urbanization, increased spending power of consumers, and more females joining the workforce are further anticipated to fuel the growth of the baby diapers market in the next few years. On the flip side, the reusability of diapers and declining birth rates in developed economies are the major factors hampering the growth of the global baby diapers market. By product type, the global market for baby diapers has been categorized into cloth diapers, training nappies, disposable diapers, and swim pants. Among these types, in 2011, the disposable diapers segment leads the market, holding a 66% share in the global baby diapers market. The sub-segments of the disposable diapers segment (ultra-absorbent diapers and super-absorbent diapers) are gaining popularity owing to their reasonable pricing and effective absorption. In addition, the introduction of biodegradable diapers has created fresh opportunities for the major players operating in the market. By geography, the global market for baby diapers has been classified into Latin America, EMEA, Asia Pacific, and North America. Previously, North America dominated the global baby diapers market; however, the region is estimated to lose its leading position in the next few years. At present, the EMEA market for baby diapers accounts for a 33% share in the global baby diapers market. It is followed by Asia Pacific, which holds a 30% share in the market globally. The Latin America and Asia-Pacific markets collectively are projected to reach a valuation of US$16.6 bn by the end of 2017. On the other hand, the Asia Pacific market for baby diapers is anticipated to grow rapidly exhibiting a progressive 8.40% CAGR between 2011 and 2017.

(Mark Newman/MLB.com) By Mark Sheldon / MLB.com | @m_sheldon | + 0 COMMENTS CINCINNATI -- It's been nearly 63 years since Chuck Harmon made history for the Reds as their first African-American player. Time has not diminished what he has meant to Cincinnati, and the club continues to embrace and honor Harmon's legacy. Harmon, then 29, appeared for the first time as a pinch-hitter in the seventh inning against the Milwaukee Braves on April 17, 1954, seven years after Jackie Robinson broke the Major League color barrier with the Dodgers. "He came through at a time when it was difficult for African-Americans to play pro baseball. Even though it was several years after Jackie Robinson, he was our first," said Rick Walls, the executive director of the Reds Hall of Fame. Harmon is now 92 years old and remains a Cincinnati resident. In a sit-down interview with MLB.com ahead of the Civil Rights Game in 2010, he said he never let the issue of racism bother him while he was playing, even in a city like Cincinnati that was racially divided at the time. "If you worried about how you were being treated or going to be treated, you don't need to be there," Harmon said. "You have to play the game and do all the little extra things. You don't have time to wonder if someone will look at you cross-eyed or say something to you. It was enough to worry about that baseball coming at you or someone sliding into you. There were too many other things to worry about." Harmon shakes hands with his son, Chuck Harmon Jr., during a 2004 plaque unveiling ceremony honoring him.(AP Photo/Al Behrman) Harmon spent four seasons in the Major Leagues. He was traded from the Reds to the Cardinals in May 1956 and dealt again in '57 to the Phillies. Over his 289 career games in the big leagues, he batted .238 with seven home runs and 59 RBIs. "Mr. Harmon, he was always pulling for the Reds," former Reds manager Dusty Baker said in 2010. "I remember when Frank Robinson came in, he took him under his wing. Frank was a young African-American kid from Oakland coming to Cincinnati -- it was a little different back then. Mr. Harmon went through a lot and talked to Frank. Back in the day, to be the first African-American anywhere was different. I went through being the first African-American in my school district -- me and my brother -- in high school. I know how hard it was for me in 1966, so I imagine what it was like for him in 1954." In his post-playing career, Harmon scouted for the Braves, Indians and the NBA's Indiana Pacers. He also worked in sales for the MacGregor Sporting Goods Company. For 24 years he worked as an administrative assistant at Ohio's First District Court of Appeals, and he was married for 62 years to Daurel, who passed away in 2009. The couple had three children. For several years, Harmon was a fixture at Great American Ball Park to watch games. He also is a frequent guest at events like Redsfest and other special occasions for the club. In 2014, Harmon received the Powell Crosley Jr. Award from the Reds Hall of Fame and Museum for his dedication and devotion to the Reds. "It was for his influence and ambassadorship with the fans and represents the club and carries himself," Walls said. "He's a humanitarian in many ways and a class act all of the time." In 2015, during the week of the All-Star Game in Cincinnati, the Reds honored Harmon with a statue outside of the P&G Cincinnati MLB Youth Academy. • Harmon statue unveiled "It was always a pleasure to give someone an autograph or have a picture taken with them," Harmon said. "That's why they come out there. It makes you feel good. Naturally, in your heart, you say to yourself, 'I must be doing something right.'" In March, he will be part of a new Reds Hall of Fame exhibit, "From Red to Bronze," which focuses on the nine Reds players that have had statues made in their honor. "People ask me the same old thing: 'Did you think you would make history?'" Harmon said. "I tell them, 'When you're born, you're history.' You don't realize when you're actually making history."

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 8 February 2017 by Military News Sunday’s Big Game: An Opportunity for Beer Brands to Win at the Shelf SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Quri, the leader in Performance Driven Merchandising™, is announcing today the results from its beer-focused performance driven merchandising campaign, highlighting the opportunity for brands to drive sales through better in-store merchandising execution. The data released tracked the performance of 11 beer brands including Bud Light, Miller Lite, Shock Top, Michelob Ultra, Samuel Adams, Corona, and more, in hundreds of stores across the mass merchandiser and grocery channels. While many of the big beer brands make a significant investment in advertising dollars, an investment in the right tools and training for internal teams and their distributor partners can turn in-store merchandising execution efforts into a strategic competitive advantage. „Beer continues to be a merchandising battleground, with fierce competition for refrigerator space and display location taking place due to shopper desire for beer variety and microbrew brands. There is a major opportunity for both macro and craft brands to drive competitive advantage through field labor optimization for increased sales and share gains,” comments Justin Behar, CEO of Quri. The data analyzed includes brands’ merchandising presence both in off shelf displays and primary home locations across 800 Walmart and Kroger stores for the 14 days ending Monday, February 6, 2017. The full list of brands in the beer category are: Bud Light, Shock Top, Michelob Ultra, Samuel Adams, Modelo, Guinness, Fat Tire, Corona, Blue Moon, Sierra Nevada, and Miller Lite. Observations from the study include: Average Number of Displays: Beer has 4.0 Displays per store on average, Bud Light (1.4), Miller Lite (1.0) During the vital week leading up to the Big Game, it is crucial for beer brands and manufacturers to ensure their displays are flawlessly executed at every retailer. Through Quri’s Performance Driven Merchandising™ platform, an empowered field labor force can focus on executing and selling in store versus collecting data.     Percentage of Stores with a Display by Brand: Blue Moon (18%), Miller Lite (76%), Sierra Nevada (5%) With stores having 4.0 beer displays on average, manufacturers need to compete to be one of those 4.0 displays.  Especially for craft brands, who may not have a television ad, it behooves them to try and get some sort of display to compete with the bigger brands. On-Shelf Availability by Brand: Guinness (97%), Blue Moon (94%), Sierra Nevada (90%) Even though the on-shelf availability of beer brands is skewing high, there is still a significant opportunity to improve on-shelf availability.  For each 2 to 3 percentage points increase in OSA, Quri has seen manufacturers increase sales by 1%. A well informed field labor workforce can showcase the competitive advantage needed to turn a few percentage points into higher incremental sales and share gains for both brands and manufacturers. While macro brands such as Bud Light and Michelob Ultra continue to dominate in-store merchandising around the Big Game, there is still an opportunity for these heavy hitters to continue to be MVPs by maximizing their efforts during other power periods such as Easter, Memorial Day, and 4th of July. Quri will unveil the culmination of its category data during a webinar on Wednesday, February 8th at 2:00 p.m. EST / 11:00 a.m. PST. In celebration of the Big Game, the company also incorporated the insights into an infographic that highlights the real MVPs for their in-store merchandising execution efforts. The webinar will take a deeper look at the results and demonstrate how brands can use in-store merchandising data to win in-store. You can register for the 30-minute webinar at http://bit.ly/2jwGRUb.

Chance discussed this topic at The Market Research Event. And her first suggestion for marketers was to think about the lessons from services that make it "easy" for consumers to achieve their goals, be it buying goods online or finding a date. "Pleasure and pain is important for motivation, but ease – and difficulty – have a much greater impact on behaviour," said Chance. (For more details, read Warc's exclusive report: Five "key" tools of marketing influence.) Taxi app Uber, e-commerce platform Amazon and dating app Tinder are paradigmatic examples of this philosophy in action, she argued, as they provide services that are both effective and extremely simple to use. Another worthwhile consideration for brands involves scarcity, a notion Chance defined as "when someone tells you there's limited time, or limited quantity, or something's very exclusive". Building on this theme, she asserted that the risk of "loss aversion" typically encourages consumers to make such purchases before it's too late – an idea epitomised by traditional supermarket circulars offering short-term deals. Chance also outlined a list of questions that marketers can ask in seeking to embrace this principle as part of their own communications strategies. "Is it new information? Is it proprietary information? Is it information that not many people know? Is it controversial information? How can you convey a sense of scarcity, even in a situation where it is not necessarily limited in time, not necessarily limited in quantity?" she asked. Understanding tangible "moments of truth" for consumers is another vital objective, as it leads brand custodians to focus on those moments when people are truly paying attention and are properly interested in what is being said. Procter & Gamble, which helped popularise the concept of the "moment of truth", leveraged this idea with Bonux laundry detergent in Lebanon, running ads on the top of buses to be seen when consumers were hanging out washing on their balconies. "When do you think you get excited about laundry detergent?" said Chance. "Never, right? Except when you're doing laundry – or, at least, thinking about it."
