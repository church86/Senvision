Secret, owned by consumer products powerhouse Procter & Gamble, uses the campaign called #StressTest to take a closer look at situations that lead women to sweat. The ads are part of a growing trend of companies embracing feminist ideals and female empowerment to sell their products.

Brands such as Always feminine hygiene products (also owned by P&G) and Dove, Unilever's brand of moisturizers, shampoos, conditioners, body washes and soaps, are selling confidence and strength to women. In a nod to Women's History Month this March, pulp and paper producer Georgia-Pacific replaced its plaid-shirted man with a similarly-clad woman on Brawny paper towels.  While some companies are engaged in efforts to aid and empower women, activists fear the commercialization of feminism could water down their efforts. Brands, they argue, are using feminism in hopes that consumers will associate it with them and consumers will think well of their products. The marketing around women's empowerment has reached a fever pitch in recent months. Some attribute it to feminism's growing influence in pop culture and the mobilization of millions across the world for gender equality, such as in the women's marches following the inauguration of President Donald Trump — a figure whose behavior towards, and comments about, women have drawn deep criticism.  "Right now, especially in the wake of the election there are many more brands that are really grabbing onto feminism and being like, okay, this is a good way to sell products that have nothing to do with feminism or progress," says Andi Ziegler founder of bitchmedia, a feminist media organization. "Marketplace feminism comes to steal the show from more explicit active feminism."  Women are a big target for marketers. They drive an estimated 70% to 80% of consumer spending with their purchasing power and influence, according to Boston Consulting Group. Women influence 91% of all home purchases, with 75% identifying themselves as the primary shoppers for their households, according to Bridget Brennan, founder and CEO of Female Factor Corp., a consultancy that helps companies market to women.   This has left some women feeling used.  “Most companies tend not to invest in feminist programs, they just tend to use feminist rhetoric to try to get us to spend our money,” says Jennifer Pozner, a media literacy educator and founder of Women in Media and News, a media analysis, education and advocacy group.  Dior, the European luxury goods house, sold a $710 T-shirt with the slogan, "We should all be feminist" emblazoned on it, referencing a 2014 essay by Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Although a portion of proceeds were given to the Clara Lionel Foundation, pop singer Rihanna's, nonprofit organization that benefits impoverished communities across the globe, with healthcare, and education, many were critical of the fashion house. "Could you have given your $700 to a women’s shelter, or an after school program for girls?," says Pozner. "Companies trying to redirect that energy and action away from anything subversive and towards hyper-consumerist spending does deep damage to the public because it makes it harder for us to move forward politically." Still, many women and activists aren't so quick to write off marketers and advertisers. Jess Weiner, CEO of Talk to Jess, a consulting firm, works with major brands to help them craft a more authentic connection with their audience.  “You have to look at brands and say, 'what else are they doing besides advertising to me? Where is their money going? Are they being part of the problem or the solution?' Many brands are not really walking their talk outside of their marketing circle," says Weiner. One of Weiner's first corporate clients, Dove, launched its "Real Beauty" campaign in 2004. The campaign aimed to shatter beauty standards, but the company still received angry backlash partly due to the fact that it was launched with the advertisement of a cellulite cream and also because it retouched the ads.Critics of the Dove campaign found the message of self-acceptance hypocritical when paired with the pitch for a product convincing consumers that they should fit into a traditional standard of beauty. Today, the brand says it's dedicated to making women feel good about themselves.  “Dove is a brand that is committed to creating a world where beauty is a source of confidence and not anxiety,” says Nick Soukas, vice president of marketing at Dove. Weiner offers a view that suggests the brand learned from the ire it faced. Since then, Dove has added more ethnically diverse women of varying age groups to the campaign. Weiner has worked with Dove on the campaign, helping curate and create lesson plans and launch educational workshops on media literacy and female empowerment. "Dove has been the leader of this conversation for over a decade, there are bound to be moments that don’t always resound with consumers. Sometimes you’re progressive, sometimes you miss the mark," says Weiner.  But when companies with a bottom line become part of the mix, even the ones that seem to embody the most feminist values may have issues that fly in the face of the movement's ideals. Thinx, the brand of underwear that can be worn as a supplement or substitute for tampons and pads has been lauded as feminist and progressive for speaking frankly about menstrual cycles, which some see as taboo. But company and co-founder Miki Agrawal, viewed by many as an ultra-progressive feminist mogul, recently came under fire after she stepped down from her position as CEO to chief visionary officer, according to a story published this month by Racked, a subsidiary of Vox Media. Racked's account described a volatile work environment and alleged that health care plans were “prohibitively expensive,” with just two weeks of paid maternity leave and one week at a half-pay rate for a parent who has given birth. Tyler Ford, the first transgender contestant on "The Glee Project," a television singing competition on Oxygen and writer and advocate for transgender folks, posted a series of tweets calling an experience working with the company humiliating, uncomfortable and a marketing opportunity.   Agrawal who commented for this story prior to the publication of Racked's article declined to comment to USA TODAY about the allegations in the story or about Ford's tweets. However, in an email response to Jezebel, a subsidary of Gizmodo Media Group , said "Like every other startup, there’s turnover in the first few years. THINX is no different, we have growing pains too, but now we are on the right track."  People who want to make socially conscious buying decisions need to become more aware of what companies they're supporting are doing, feminism advocates say. Empowering rhetoric might not always come from a place of genuine progress to gender equality. "It’s very difficult to make perfect decisions as a consumer. Are you supporting a company with family leave policies? Do they use sweatshop labor, exploiting workers overseas?" Pozner says."If it’s a company using feminist rhetoric to sell their product, are they doing anything that’s feminist?"  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

That’s a problem for media giant Google, says Simon Wilson. What’s happened? Revelations that advertisements from such respectable outfits as the UK government, Sainsbury’s and L’Oréal were featured alongside inappropriate YouTube content – including white supremacist groups and jihadist preachers – have caused a host of firms and organisations to pull their digital advertising from the Google-owned video site. Among the 250-and-counting organisations to suspend their advertisements include the BBC, The Guardian newspaper, Marks & Spencer, McDonald’s, Channel 4, Tesco, Audi and several banks. Many of the companies boycotting Google had discovered only by reading The Times’s investigation that their advertising budget was being used to place banner advertisements over these videos, thus indirectly funding extremists and damaging the prestige of their brands. What was Google thinking? It wasn’t. Like much of the digital advertising industry, Google uses “programmatic advertising”. When you buy advertising space on TV, radio or in a print publication, a representative of the firm, such as a media buyer working on behalf of an advertising agency, will negotiate with the media outlet’s advertising team specifying where and when it will run and the cost. In digital advertising, digital trading desks at media buying agencies still plan, book and execute campaigns on behalf of clients, but the specific slots where advertisements appear are allocated by computer algorithms and a complex automated auction-style clearing system. How does that work? When you click on a webpage, advertisers in effect bid for space on that page based on cookies and other tags tracking your online activities with the aim of serving you advertisements you’ll want to see. An auction is held and the “winning” advertisement is transmitted in milliseconds. All this is “as complex as it is… fast”, says The Economist. “Thousands of firms jostle to analyse consumer data and buy, sell and monitor” advertisements, and an advertising impression sold programmatically can change hands 15 times before being bought by an advertiser and served. That brings both thrilling innovation, and massive headaches, like this incident. Will the publicity damage Google? Google has apologised and sworn to do better, but it’s too early to say how serious the fallout will be. Given that print publishers have seen their advertising earnings collapse due to the advance of Google and Facebook, newpapers have every interest in keeping the story running. On the other hand, for advertisers keen to reach digital audiences, Google and Facebook have huge power, accounting for almost 60% of the £11bn UK digital advertising market and 90% of new spending, says market research firm eMarketer. Michael Roth, CEO of global advertising giant Interpublic, told the FT that the scandal is unlikely to presage a collapse in Google revenues, but that it would lose business if it can’t fix the issue of extremist content. It doesn’t help that the scandal is just one of the issues now facing the digital advertising sector. What are the others? Integrity and trust. Digital should help make advertising more effective, with more personalised and targeted advertisements. The problem is that while advertisers have gained in some ways (the ability to personalise) they’ve lost in others (the certainty that a claimed viewer has seen their advertisement). There are no agreed standards and metrics for what counts as a “view”, how much of the advertisement has to be visible on the screen and for how long, or on how these metrics should be verified by third parties (in the way that has been standard in the TV industry for decades). Worse, an advertiser can’t even be sure that their advertisement, if it hasn’t been prevented from appearing by blocking technology, was viewed by a human as opposed to a “bot” (see below). Are advertisers restive? The rumblings coming from the biggest global advertiser of all – Procter & Gamble (P&G), which shelled out $10bn in 2015 on advertising its consumer brands – are ominous. Back in 2012, P&G was full of the joys of the newish technology, telling Wall Street it expected to make $1bn in savings by targeting customers through digital advertising and social media. But now it’s a different story. At a recent advertising jamboree, P&G’s chief brand officer, Marc Pritchard, attacked what he called the “exponential increase in crap” associated with online marketing, and the “even crappier” viewing experience. “Together [as advertisers] we’re now spending $70bn on digital adverts”, he noted, but complained that “we serve advertisements to consumers through a non-transparent media supply chain with spotty compliance to common standards, unreliable measurements, hidden rebates, and new inventions like bots driving fraud”. His message was clear: “frankly, the jig is up” and the days of “giving digital a pass are over”. How big a problem is fraud? Global spending on web advertisements will surpass expenditure on TV advertising for the first time this year. TV spending has remained steady for the past five years, at around $170bn. Web spending has more than doubled, from $80bn in 2012 to a forecast $200bn in 2017, says ZenithOptimedia, a media agency. Yet an industry investigation last year found that up to 37% of online impressions are made by bots – ie, programmes that “visit” sites to drive up traffic metrics and fraudulently entice more advertising. That’s not a sustainable position, says Leila Abboud of Bloomberg. “The flow of money from TV and print to the web could slow or reverse.” If advertising and media agencies can’t be transparent about how they spend money, “contracts will be cancelled or revised”.

"A week after Google apologized for running customers' advertisements alongside objectionable videos, triggering a change in policy, its YouTube site is still rife with examples that are angering more big advertisers and causing some to cut spending with the tech giant," reports the Dow Jones Newswire. Reporters from the Wall Street Journal spotted ads from Microsoft, Amazon, and Procter & Gamble appearing on hate videos -- and thus indirectly funding them. An anonymous reader quotes their report: Asked about the Journal's finding that their ads were still appearing with such content on YouTube as of Thursday night, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo Inc., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Dish Network Corp. said Friday they were suspending spending on all Google advertising except targeted search ads. Starbucks Corp. and General Motors Co. said they were pulling their ads from YouTube. FX Networks, part of 21st Century Fox Inc., said it was suspending all advertising spending on Google, including search ads and YouTube. Wal-Mart said: "The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values." An executive at one of the affected companies complained that Google "had assured us over the past few days that our brands were safe from this type of content. Despite their assurances, it's clear they couldn't give assurance." google youtube advertising ← Related Links → SAS Mocked For Recommending 60% Proprietary Software, 40% Open Source YouTube Says Content Owners Made $1B Last Year -- So Music Labels Should Stop Complaining Google To Revamp Policies, Hire Staff After UK Ad Scandal YouTube Loses Major Advertisers Over Offensive Videos Terrifying Anti-Riot Vehicle Created To Quash Any Urban Disturbance Still More Advertisers Pull Google Ads Over YouTube Hate Videos More | Reply Login Still More Advertisers Pull Google Ads Over YouTube Hate Videos Post Load All Comments  Full  Abbreviated  Hidden /Sea Score: 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 More | Reply Login   Nickname: Password: Public Terminal Forgot your password?

[freepresshouston.com] 'Free speech' has become a mantra for bullying the people whose opinion is that there are things they don't like and don't want to see; but that in itself becomes a kind of censorship. Not by the government, but by other groups - and it is extremely easy to bombard websites with updates that drown out opinions that you as a person or group don't like. Ideally, if all people were honest and genuinely played by the rules of good citizenship etc, free speech would be truly free, but it only takes a small minority of bullies to take that away. Governments in democratic countries don't actually want to limit people's freedom of speech, because when people feel they can let off steam, they are less likely to want to upset things too much. It is the different bullying groups, the extremists, religious or otherwise, who talk the loudest about "freedom" and constitutional right, and they are also the ones who are working the hardest to take that away from the general public.

But can it make it happen? ANA The Association of National Advertisers (ANA) released a statement last week calling on the major social media and digital enterprises to embrace transparency, and submit to independent audits by the Media Rating Council. This isn't the first time the ANA has called for transparency and certainly won't be the last. YouTube and Facebook recently announced they will allow independent audits from the Media Rating Council, a big victory for the ANA and advertisers that have called for more accountability on metrics. This on the heels of Google announcing it will give advertisers more control over where their ads appear; a response no doubt to news of the French advertising company Havas Worldwide pulling its entire ad budget from Google and YouTube in the U.K. due to concerns over its ads running against hateful content. Previously, YouTube and Facebook both reported glitches in its subscriber (for YouTube) and video viewing metrics (for Facebook). The thread leading to this ANA pressure on so-called walled gardens is clear. Marketers want more transparency. “Today, media isn't only seen as a tool to get awareness, it's more seen as a business driver. Because of that, clients want to see their media buys linked to sales… It's imperative that it's transparent,” says Carl Erik Kjaersgaard, founder and CEO at the media agency Blackwood Seven. As a collective of some 600 companies and more than 10,000 brands, the ANA represents a sizable sample of the advertising market. However, the ANA could be limited in making definitive demands of those walled gardens, as its membership organizations may have different thresholds on what they will allow. “There will come pressure from the market where they have to be more transparent,” Kjaersgaard says. “I don't think clients will move all of their money from those [walled gardens], but they will look at more options.” Now, those options could be more transparent media networks like Kjaersgaard's company, or a more extreme approach, like Procter & Gamble's, which recently announced it will no longer pay for digital media that doesn't adhere to its standards for fraud and viewability transparency. In any event, marketers are showing their impatience with companies like Facebook and Google, and are demonstrating their need for more transparency. “While walled gardens create safe and trusted environments for consumers, marketers' ability to combine insights from open and closed environments simply compounds downward trending numbers,” says Lewis Gersh, CEO at the programmatic direct mail company PebblePost. “[It's a] classic ‘the emperor has no clothes' situation. The more interesting question is ‘Why is everyone imagining what he might be wearing at this point?' What we should focus on are the core issues around how marketers and consumers interact.” Previous Post One on One Louis Rosenberg on the Merits of Swarm Intelligence, the Other A.I.

STRATEGY Why Facebook's Snapchat Clone Is a Master Class in Disruption It's often said that "you need to skate to where the puck is going." Learn to love disruption and you'll never get tired of that puck chase. By Allen Lau Allen Lau is the co-founder and CEO of Wattpad, a global multi-platform entertainment company for original stories. He is a serial entrepreneur with a passion for mobile technology. @allenlau Co-founder and CEO, Wattpad@allenlau WRITE A COMMENT Mark Zuckerberg (center), co-founder and CEO of Facebook. CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement The media is obsessed with Facebook's rollout of Snapchat-like features, and what they mean for the two companies. It's easy to see why--competition creates drama, and drama commands attention. Facebook versus Google Plus. Periscope versus Meerkat. Foursquare versus Gowalla. Each major advancement in technology brings a wave of disruption that can level any playing field. Every business is a target for disruption. Right now, someone's coding a product or service that may fundamentally change the way you do business. In my decades of experience in the tech industry, I've come away with a better understanding of why businesses go after each other, and what it takes to survive as either the champion or contender. Underdog Contenders Steal the Title With: Belief In the early years of my company, Wattpad, my co-founder, Ivan Yuen, and I only made enough ad revenue a month to buy a single cup of coffee. Most entrepreneurs might have cut their losses and walked away, but a deeply rooted belief in our company's vision kept us in the game. We believed our product would revolutionize how people discover, share, and connect through stories. Meaningful companies are built upon a strong, timeless vision. Speed If a problem exists in the market that your product or service can solve, don't expect it to exist forever. Competition in business is time sensitive. In almost all cases, there is an extremely small window of opportunity to win. Google solved the problem of search and became the portal to the internet. Snapchat pioneered ephemeral visual communication, then moved quickly to capture the market. Speed is one of the best assets for a growing company. Make decisions quickly and execute with purpose. Ambition In 1993, I left an unexciting job at IBM to join a startup called Delrina. When I joined the company, it had just over 100 employees. Two years later, the company employed more than 700 people and was acquired by Symantec. Riding that rocket ship was a life-changing experience. There I learned to be ambitious enough to aim for global scale and fearless enough to take on the toughest competitors. If you build an amazing product for a global market, the sky's the limit. Aim high and find excitement in the prospect of building a world-class company. Champions Create a Winning Legacy Through: Constant reinvention Delrina's flagship product, WinFax, a fax software program for Windows, took almost 100 percent of the market. Every single one of our competitors either discontinued its products or went out of business. Even with the market cornered, Delrina would eventually have had to take on new contenders--email, SMS, social networks, and eventually messaging apps--had it not been acquired. Even legacy brand Procter & Gamble--a 178-year-old company with huge market share--goes through a major transformation every decade or so. If you don't disrupt yourself, someone will do it for you. Playing to their strengths If you think the startup clone wars of today are dramatic, look back a few decades to the browser wars. In 1995, Microsoft launched Internet Explorer 1.0 to take on the market leader at the time, Netscape. If you're unfamiliar with Netscape, you've just proved my point: For any company, it's critical to stay aware of trends and prepared for competition. The game winner for Microsoft was scale. The company included Internet Explorer 1.0 as the default browser for its operating system and pushed improvements much faster than Netscape. Today, Facebook is leveraging a few advantages against Snapchat. Scale, access to resources, and experience working with Instagram's camera-centric audience are all reasons why Facebook is siphoning eyes from Snapchat. Being the market leader means that you're in the best position to monitor and act on trends that affect your business. If You Rise to the Challenge, You'll Learn to Love Disruption It's often said that "you need to skate to where the puck is going." Learn to love disruption and you'll never get tired of that puck chase. The cloning of features by competing companies is nothing new. After releasing Instagram's version of Snapchat-style stories, Instagram's CEO made this statement in an interview with TechCrunch: "Gmail was not the first email client. Google Maps was certainly not the first map. The iPhone was definitely not the first phone. The question is, what do you do with that format? What do you do with that idea? Do you build on it? Do you add new things? Are you trying to bring it in a new direction?" In other words, your mindset, approach, and creativity will determine how well you do against the competition. Each industry faces its own disruptive trends. Smart businesses stay ahead of their own disruption by monitoring trends in the marketplace and placing their bets accordingly. At Wattpad, we actively monitor shifts in consumer behavior and trends in the entertainment space. We know people will continue to crave entertainment, but we understand that every few years how they want to be entertained will be drastically different. It's this understanding that led us to release Tap by Wattpad, a new app for short, chat-style stories. We observed various trends in messaging and understood behavior related to social storytelling. We applied that to the development of Tap to stay ahead of the curve. Continuous reinvention sets a standard for us. It a creates a focus on perpetual growth. Disney started out in animation, and then grew to be an entertainment giant. Facebook started out as a site to connect college kids, and then became the largest social media network of all time. The battle for attention between Facebook and Snapchat is far from over. The clear vision of Snapchat combined with its proven speed of execution makes it a contender. The scale and resources at Facebook are what make it a formidable opponent. Will Facebook successfully stunt Snapchat's growth, or will Snapchat usher in an era of cultural supremacy for the camera? As always, only time will tell. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com. Published on: Mar 23, 2017 Advertisement

Courtesy of Department of Special Collections-WKU Duncan Hines, traveling salesman and future purveyor of boxed cake mix, considered himself an authority on a great many things: hot coffee, Kentucky country-cured ham and how to locate a tasty restaurant meal, in 1935, for under a dollar and a quarter. Enlarge this image Duncan Hines wasn't a chef, he was a businessman looking for a decent meal on the road. Courtesy of Department of Special Collections-WKU hide caption toggle caption Courtesy of Department of Special Collections-WKU Duncan Hines wasn't a chef, he was a businessman looking for a decent meal on the road. Courtesy of Department of Special Collections-WKU By the 1950s, Hines' name would be plastered on boxes of cake mix; housewives would turn to his products for consistent quality and superior taste. Newspaper photographs featured Hines clad in a white chef's apron, hoisting a neatly frosted cake or thoughtfully dipping a spoon into a mixing bowl. But Duncan Hines wasn't a chef — in truth, he could barely cook. For most of his career, he had just been a businessman, desperate for a decent meal on the road. Through his search for the best restaurants across America, he became an accidental gourmand, an unlikely author and homegrown connoisseur. Although boxed cake mix is the legacy that most people now associate with Duncan Hines (only after asking, "Was he actually a real person?") the supermarket foods that bear his name are only an epilogue to a storied life traveling America's back roads. It was really his book, Adventures in Good Eating, that first put Duncan Hines on the map. And it was his tireless pursuit of good food that inspired his book. A decent meal Hines' appreciation for a good meal arose out of mere necessity. From the 1920s through the '40s, he motored across the country hawking letter openers and paperclips and subsisting on unreliable road food. It was an era long before any formal restaurant rating system existed in the U.S. The names and locations of good restaurants were conveyed by word of mouth; for an out-of-town traveler, locating a decent supper was often a daunting and discouraging mission. And although Europe had relied on The Michelin Guide since 1900, middle America in the 1920s and '30s was still a land of culinary mystery and inconsistency. Enlarge this image 1946 copy of "Adventures in Good Eating." Nicole Jankowski for NPR hide caption toggle caption Nicole Jankowski for NPR 1946 copy of "Adventures in Good Eating." Nicole Jankowski for NPR It was also a time of growing wanderlust. Highways such as Route 66 were connecting small towns, and eager motorists often embarked on weekend road trips. According to the University of Michigan, in the '20s "the number of automobiles in America rose from eight million to twenty-three million and along with the increase came thousands of barbeque shacks, ice cream stands and diners." Many new restaurants were not listed on maps. And they were often hidden on dusty back roads that health inspectors didn't travel. (Even if they did, there was no standard for restaurant food safety in America at that time.) Desperate for a clean place to dine, Hines became an investigative epicurean and self-made restaurant critic. He carried a tiny journal in his coat pocket, jotting down the precise locations of his favorite places. No restaurant was off limits for the inquisitive Hines. "The kitchen is the first spot I inspect in an eating place," he wrote. "More people will die from hit or miss eating than from hit and run driving," he joked — though Hines clearly thought food safety was no laughing matter. He frequently popped into the kitchen to scrutinize how staff handled food and then swung around back to investigate the restaurant's garbage pile. He meticulously recorded the names of the most pristine diners, the inns with the tastiest prime roast beef, and where to find the stickiest honey buns. He appreciated regional cuisine, quickly discovering in which part of the country to brake for broiled lobster tail (New England) and where to stop for fried chicken (Kentucky). Hines noted whether a restaurant had air conditioning, its hours of operation and its prices for breakfast, lunch and dinner. "His restaurant notes were extraordinarily accurate," says Louis Hatchett, author of the book, Duncan Hines: How a Traveling Salesman Became the Most Trusted Name in Food. "As word spread among his family and friends, people were begging him to share the list he had created. There was nothing out there like it," he says. "In 1935, sick of being pestered, he finally sent out a little blue pamphlet in his Christmas cards, containing a list of 167 restaurants across 33 states that he could safely recommend." Soon, Hines was receiving postcards from from salesmen, newlyweds and other travelers all over America seeking his recommendations for good, clean restaurants. In 1936, at 55, Hines self-published his first edition of Adventures in Good Eating and sold them for $1 each. It contained the names and locations of 475 restaurants from coast to coast that had Hines' rigorous seal of approval. "The books were sold through word of mouth, but they quickly sold out. The following year he raised the guide's price to $1.50 — and that's where the price would stay for the next 25 years," explains Hatchett. Each year, until he retired in 1954, Hines broadened his exploration of America's restaurants and published an updated edition of Adventures in Good Eating. Restaurants fell in and out of Hines' favor — if they could not deliver a quality meal or allow a peek into the kitchen, they were removed from the book. He refused to accept any advertisements or endorsements from restaurants in exchange for reviews. Millions of discerning travelers kept his book in their glove compartments to guide them as they rumbled down gravelly country roads in unfamiliar locations.

Restaurants endorsed by Hines tacked up metal signs in their front windows. As his authority grew, Hines published Lodging for a Night (1938) and Adventures in Good Cooking (Famous Recipes) and the Art of Carving in the Home (1939). In 1952, when Hines was 72, he partnered with Roy H. Park to form Hines-Park in Ithaca, N.Y., allowing the Duncan Hines name to appear on everything from cartons of ice cream to the now-famous cake mixes. Two years before his death in March of 1959, the entire franchise was sold to Procter & Gamble.

Courtesy of Department of Special Collections-WKU Thanks to Ebay and rare book vendors, there is resurging interest in Adventures in Good Cooking. History lovers and discriminating foodies congregate on the forums of Roadfood.com to share modern forays into Hines' antiquated restaurant scene. Jim Pfefferle, a forum member and engineer from Wisconsin, views Duncan Hines' swift rise to fame as compelling as the material in his books. "It's kind of meteoric, what Duncan Hines did," Pfefferle tells NPR. "He was unknown when he published his first guidebook in 1936 and then there was a World War. By 1951 he was famous, the one person in the United States that anyone would go to for an authority on food. Less than 10 years later, he was gone." Pfefferle, along with other members of the forum, has spent the past two years painstakingly gathering a list of restaurants from Hines' books that are still in operation. He says it has been an intimidating task filled with many gastronomic dead-ends, but he believes that about 37 of the original 167 restaurants on Hines' 1935 list remain. Hines often said, "Nearly everyone wants at least one outstanding meal a day." This seems as true now as it did a half-century ago. But long before Yelp or TripAdvisor offered restaurant reviews with the click of a button, Hines was doing it his own way, by traveling the highway with his pencil and notebook, changing the way America ate on the open road — one adventure at a time.

Courtesy of Department of Special Collections-WKU Duncan Hines, traveling salesman and future purveyor of boxed cake mix, considered himself an authority on a great many things: hot coffee, Kentucky country-cured ham and how to locate a tasty restaurant meal, in 1935, for under a dollar and a quarter.

Courtesy of Department of Special Collections-WKU hide caption toggle caption Courtesy of Department of Special Collections-WKU Duncan Hines wasn't a chef, he was a businessman looking for a decent meal on the road. Courtesy of Department of Special Collections-WKU By the 1950s, Hines' name would be plastered on boxes of cake mix; housewives would turn to his products for consistent quality and superior taste. Newspaper photographs featured Hines clad in a white chef's apron, hoisting a neatly frosted cake or thoughtfully dipping a spoon into a mixing bowl. But Duncan Hines wasn't a chef — in truth, he could barely cook. For most of his career, he had just been a businessman, desperate for a decent meal on the road. Through his search for the best restaurants across America, he became an accidental gourmand, an unlikely author and homegrown connoisseur. Although boxed cake mix is the legacy that most people now associate with Duncan Hines (only after asking, "Was he actually a real person?") the supermarket foods that bear his name are only an epilogue to a storied life traveling America's back roads. It was really his book, Adventures in Good Eating, that first put Duncan Hines on the map. And it was his tireless pursuit of good food that inspired his book. A decent meal Hines' appreciation for a good meal arose out of mere necessity. From the 1920s through the '40s, he motored across the country hawking letter openers and paperclips and subsisting on unreliable road food. It was an era long before any formal restaurant rating system existed in the U.S. The names and locations of good restaurants were conveyed by word of mouth; for an out-of-town traveler, locating a decent supper was often a daunting and discouraging mission. And although Europe had relied on The Michelin Guide since 1900, middle America in the 1920s and '30s was still a land of culinary mystery and inconsistency. Enlarge this image 1946 copy of "Adventures in Good Eating." Nicole Jankowski for NPR hide caption toggle caption Nicole Jankowski for NPR 1946 copy of "Adventures in Good Eating." Nicole Jankowski for NPR It was also a time of growing wanderlust. Highways such as Route 66 were connecting small towns, and eager motorists often embarked on weekend road trips. According to the University of Michigan, in the '20s "the number of automobiles in America rose from eight million to twenty-three million and along with the increase came thousands of barbeque shacks, ice cream stands and diners." Many new restaurants were not listed on maps. And they were often hidden on dusty back roads that health inspectors didn't travel. (Even if they did, there was no standard for restaurant food safety in America at that time.) Desperate for a clean place to dine, Hines became an investigative epicurean and self-made restaurant critic. He carried a tiny journal in his coat pocket, jotting down the precise locations of his favorite places. No restaurant was off limits for the inquisitive Hines. "The kitchen is the first spot I inspect in an eating place," he wrote. "More people will die from hit or miss eating than from hit and run driving," he joked — though Hines clearly thought food safety was no laughing matter. He frequently popped into the kitchen to scrutinize how staff handled food and then swung around back to investigate the restaurant's garbage pile. He meticulously recorded the names of the most pristine diners, the inns with the tastiest prime roast beef, and where to find the stickiest honey buns. He appreciated regional cuisine, quickly discovering in which part of the country to brake for broiled lobster tail (New England) and where to stop for fried chicken (Kentucky). Hines noted whether a restaurant had air conditioning, its hours of operation and its prices for breakfast, lunch and dinner. "His restaurant notes were extraordinarily accurate," says Louis Hatchett, author of the book, Duncan Hines: How a Traveling Salesman Became the Most Trusted Name in Food. "As word spread among his family and friends, people were begging him to share the list he had created. There was nothing out there like it," he says. "In 1935, sick of being pestered, he finally sent out a little blue pamphlet in his Christmas cards, containing a list of 167 restaurants across 33 states that he could safely recommend." Soon, Hines was receiving postcards from from salesmen, newlyweds and other travelers all over America seeking his recommendations for good, clean restaurants. In 1936, at 55, Hines self-published his first edition of Adventures in Good Eating and sold them for $1 each. It contained the names and locations of 475 restaurants from coast to coast that had Hines' rigorous seal of approval. "The books were sold through word of mouth, but they quickly sold out. The following year he raised the guide's price to $1.50 — and that's where the price would stay for the next 25 years," explains Hatchett. Each year, until he retired in 1954, Hines broadened his exploration of America's restaurants and published an updated edition of Adventures in Good Eating. Restaurants fell in and out of Hines' favor — if they could not deliver a quality meal or allow a peek into the kitchen, they were removed from the book. He refused to accept any advertisements or endorsements from restaurants in exchange for reviews. Millions of discerning travelers kept his book in their glove compartments to guide them as they rumbled down gravelly country roads in unfamiliar locations.

Restaurants endorsed by Hines tacked up metal signs in their front windows. As his authority grew, Hines published Lodging for a Night (1938) and Adventures in Good Cooking (Famous Recipes) and the Art of Carving in the Home (1939). In 1952, when Hines was 72, he partnered with Roy H. Park to form Hines-Park in Ithaca, N.Y., allowing the Duncan Hines name to appear on everything from cartons of ice cream to the now-famous cake mixes. Two years before his death in March of 1959, the entire franchise was sold to Procter & Gamble.

Except they aren't quiet. In fact, there is a small crowd of potential Democrats gathering (and organizing) to take on three-term incumbent Republican Brad Wenstrup in Ohio's Second Congressional District next year. Does this seem odd to you? In this heavily Republican district, one that stretches from eastern Hamilton County east to Pike and Scioto counties? It just might seem odd. But, as we have learned in politics over the past year, many of the old rules are out the window. Here's a district that Wenstrup won in 2016 with 65 percent of the vote. His Democratic opponent, a Pike County truck driver named William R. "Butch" Smith – who did not do a lick of campaigning throughout the entire election, came away with nearly 33 percent of the vote. Democratic party leaders are rather relieved that it seems Smith is not going to run this year. He's won primaries before without campaigning for a somewhat silly reason that his name was "Smith." Believe it or not, sometimes folks aren't paying very close attention to what's going on in their local elections. Smith's lack of effort frustrated Democratic party leaders to the point where they backed a write-in candidate, retired physician Janet Everhard of New Richmond, as their endorsed candidate, even though Smith won the primary. Strange, but true. Running a write-in campaign against candidates whose names are actually on the ballot is really, really hard and Everhard ended up with only 2.2 percent of the vote. But the New Richmond Democrat is back running again – this time on the ballot. She will not be alone. There apparently will be a primary. Two other Democrats, lawyer Richard L. Crosby of Clermont County's Union Township and Mickey Edwards, a Mt. Adams resident who teaches at the University of Cincinnati, where he is pursuing a doctorate in transportation planning. Both have campaign websites up; and both are actively campaigning, as is Everhard. On March 3, the Brown County Democratic Party tweeted out the news that Ken McNeely, the county party's central committee chairman and an unsuccessful candidate for state representative last year, plans to run for the Second District seat. But there's not much evidence of a campaign on McNeely's part at this point. So let's concentrate for the moment on the three who are actively campaigning: Credit Provided Richard L. Crosby This might seem to be an odd way to begin a campaign for a Democratic congressional nomination, but it turns out that Crosby, a lawyer in private practice in Cincinnati, voted in the Republican presidential primary last March. So, officially, he is carried on the Clermont County voter rolls as a Republican. What's that, you say, how can a person who voted as a Republican in a primary a year ago be running now as a Democrat? Because Ohio election law says he can. In Dec. 2015, Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted issued a directive based on the Ohio Revised Code saying that "a person may be a candidate for nomination of any political party at a primary election (regardless of party affiliation established by voting in a prior partisan primary) if either of the following applies: 1. The person does not hold an elective office, or (2) the person holds an elective office other than one for which candidates are nominated at a primary election." So there. That settles that. It begs the question, though, why, if you are a Democrat, would you vote in a Republican primary. "I voted strategically,'' Crosby told WVXU. "I did it to try to keep Donald Trump off the ballot." He said he voted for Ohio Gov. John Kasich in Ohio's GOP primary in hopes that a Kasich win in Ohio would give Kasich momentum and stop Trump's race to the GOP nomination. "I know a lot of Democrats who did that, just to try to stop Trump,'' Crosby said. "But the fact is, I am a Democrat and I always will be." Crosby, who lives with his wife and two young children just across the Hamilton-Clermont county line, grew up in Columbus, where his father was a commander in the Columbus police department. "I grew up in a family where public service meant something,'' Crosby said. "In our family, if you felt the call to serve, then that is what you would have to do." He is running, he said, because he believes Wenstrup is "out of touch" with the people of the district, holding carefully controlled "tele-town hall" conferences instead of real meetings with his constituents. "I am going to campaign in every corner of this district,'' Crosby said. "You will see me going to Republican events as well as Democratic events. Because if I am elected, I am going to serve everyone in this district." Credit Provided Mickey Edwards For a first time candidate, Edwards, who lives in Mount Adams with his wife and one-year-old son, has a long resume. Edwards comes from a union household; his mother was the first female president of the National Association of Letter Carriers union local in Fort Wayne, Ind. "It was from her that I learned you had to stand up for things you believe in,'' Edwards told WVXU.   He worked as a photojournalist for a while; and earned an engineering degree from Purdue University, after which he went to work at Procter & Gamble in research and development. Then, it was on to Cornell University where he earned a master's degree in public policy. That led him to a period where he worked for U.S. Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Indiana), where he worked on Highway Trust Fund and infrastructure issues. Now, as he works on his doctorate in transportation planning at the DAAP School of Planning at the University of Cincinnati, he is a classroom teacher, teaching transportation-related topics. Ohio's sprawling Second District, Edwards said is about one-third urban, one third suburban and one-third rural. "It mirrors how I have spent my life,'' Edwards said. "I've spent about a third of my life in urban areas, a third in suburbs, and a third on a farm." He's hired a campaign consultant, but he has yet to raise or spend $5,000 – the threshold that would require him to file campaign committee papers with the Federal Elections Commission. "But we will be doing that,'' Edwards said. "I'm serious about this race." Credit Campaign web site Janet Everhard Everhard may have only gotten 2.2 percent of the vote as a write-in candidate in 2016, but she worked for every one of them. "I was at every event; I was in every town and village of the district, trying to spread my message – that the people of the Second District deserved better than Brad Wenstrup as their representative in Congress,'' Everhard. A self-described "passionate supporter of progressive causes and taxpayer value," Everhard was a gynecologic physician and surgeon, who, according to her campaign biography, had to retire prematurely because of "bilateral hand dysfunction." She said she plans to formally announce her candidacy just before a "March for Science" event at Fountain Square on April 22 – Earth Day. "It seems like an appropriate time and day, even though Fountain Square isn't in the Second District – but only by a few blocks,'' Everhard said. This time, of course, she plans to be on the ballot and not racing around trying to convince people to write in her name – an almost impossible task. She said she has a major advantage over her opponents, Crosby and Edwards. "They don't have a record in this district,'' Everhard said. "I have been working for progressive causes in this area for a long time." Wenstrup, she argues, has not been responsive to the people of the district. "People – all people – in the Second District deserve representation,'' Everhard said. "Not just those who agree with his very conservative views." So what does the Wenstrup camp think of all this activity on the Democratic side, taking place so early in the game? Mark Weaver, a Republican campaign consultant who has worked on all of Wenstrup's congressional campaigns, told WVXU it is a symptom of the fact that Democrats thought they were going to win the White House last year and failed. "I think since the Democratic presidential defeat, there are a whole lot of Democrats unhappy about being shut out of power and they are starting to organize early,'' Weaver said. In 2018, Weaver said, "you are going to see very few uncontested races." Wenstrup, Weaver said, can let his record speak for itself. "He's busy doing his job, especially with his work on the House Intelligence Committee, which is more important now than ever,'' Weaver said. "And look at this district – it's very Republican,'' Weaver said. "It's going to be tough to beat him." Last year, Wenstrup outperformed Trump in the Second District by nine percentage points. "There is energy among Democrats at the far left, the ones who hate Donald Trump with the heat of a thousand suns,'' Weaver said. The energy level is not quite so high among more moderate Democrats - the kind of Democrats who populate parts of the Second District, Weaver said. "These folks are welcome to run, although I don't think most of them could find Pike County on a map; and, if they did, they'd lock their car doors when they got there," In other words, the Wenstrup camp doesn't seem to be too worried about it. Nonetheless, the crowd of Democrats wanting a piece of Brad Wenstrup is starting to form.
