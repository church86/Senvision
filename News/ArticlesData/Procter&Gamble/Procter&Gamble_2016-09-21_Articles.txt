Reprints Reprints Arthur Sadoun. Credit: Courtesy Publicis In its continuing effort to bust silos, Publicis Communications is creating a single P&L in each country for all its creative agencies, and the U.S. is next. To handle that responsibility for North America, Andrew Bruce and Kurt Ritter will be named CEO and chairman, respectively, of Publicis Communications North America at today's global meeting of 140 Publicis execs from around the world, led by Arthur Sadoun, CEO of Publicis Communications. Both will retain their current roles; Mr. Bruce is president-CEO of Publicis Worldwide's North America region and Mr. Ritter, a former longtime General Motors exec who joined Saatchi in 2003, is chairman-CEO of Saatchi & Saatchi Los Angeles and Team One, and chairman of Canada. "The P&L will be at the country level rather than the brand level," Mr. Sadoun told Ad Age. "I have no doubt this is the future." Kate Stanners Credit: Courtesy of Saatchi & Saatchi Mr. Sadoun is also announcing at today's meeting in New York the elevation of three execs – all women – at the network level. At Saatchi & Saatchi, London-based Kate Stanners, who was promoted to global chief creative officer in April, adds the title of global chairwoman. Ms. Stanners steps into the position held by Kevin Roberts until his abrupt exit in June following his controversial comments about gender diversity in an interview.

At Publicis Worldwide, Valerie Henaff, CEO of Publicis Conseil, one of France's two biggest creative shops and the network's flagship agency, will add the new title of global president. After the Kevin Roberts debacle, Publicis Groupe execs want to make it clear that advocating for gender equality starts at the top, and the promotion of three senior women at the three creative networks reflects the diversity in their ranks. "Our board is run by a woman [Publicis Groupe's Supervisory Board Chair Elisabeth Badinter]," Mr. Sadoun said. "Our two biggest offices, Paris and New York, are run by women. Our commitment to equality is very strong. I prefer to be judged on this subject that's very important for us more on what we do and not what we say." In other moves, Carla Serrano and Bill Kanarick will be promoted to co-chief strategy officers of Publicis Communications. Ms. Serrano became CEO of Publicis Worldwide's New York office in January and Mr. Kanarick is chief strategy officer of Publicis.Sapient, roles they will both keep. Publicis Communications was formed on Jan. 2, 2016, as part of a major reorganization of parent Publicis Groupe; it comprises the agency company's creative networks and is run by Mr. Sadoun. On the P&L front, Mr. Sadoun said Publicis Communications has already made the move to a country-based P&L from a brand-based P&L in more than 60% of its markets, accounting for about 40% of total revenue and helping to foster collaboration and remove barriers to total integration. Adding its two biggest markets, North America and France, to be announced today, will help bring that up to 80% of the world. Mr. Sadoun, who likes to talk about helping clients achieve transformation by using "the alchemy of creativity and technology" – and who also favors long internal emails – said in the most recent one that "we are completely moving away from brand P&Ls to country P&Ls." With the January reorganization, Publicis Groupe set up global client leaders and allowed each global client their own P&L, organization and structure. Mr. Sadoun noted the global client P&L is an internal measure at the holding company level, while Publicis Communications' move to single country P&Ls reflects how the creative agency division will be managed. He said both are "totally revolutionary" in achieving integration. Separately, Publicis Chairman-CEO Maurice Levy told the audience at a Goldman Sachs media conference this week in New York that Publicis Groupe's board will start deliberating on the much-awaited decision about the identity of his successor in November, and make an announcement by February. He is scheduled to retire in May 2017, and Mr. Sadoun is considered his likely successor, perhaps with Mr. Levy continuing to play a role. Mr. Levy returned to Paris before today's Publicis meeting. Mr. Sadoun declined to comment on succession.

(Photo: The Cincinnati Enquirer) CINCINNATI -- Procter & Gamble’s worldwide manufacturing footprint is set to shrink to the smallest it has been in more than 20 years. The Cincinnati-based company has sold or closed 17 factories around the world – including 12 in the United States – in the last five years. Next month,  eight more P&G plants will become the property of Coty, a company that makes Rimmel makeup and Calvin Klein perfume. P&G executives have assured investors the Coty deal will wrap up its two-year-long brand-selling campaign. But the company appears poised to shutter even more factories. The shift is part of an ongoing drive to improve efficiency and lower costs. Ultimately, it means P&G's signature products, such as Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, will be made in fewer, but larger manufacturing plants, and ones with more robots and automation that reduce personnel. The company has promised Wall Street another $10 billion in savings over the next half decade and has indicated a major piece will come from slimmed-down operations. CEO David Taylor said the cuts could be achieved without a “broad-based (jobs) reduction.” But to execute the plan, P&G is moving production to plants it is expanding with the intention of closing down others. P&G's manufacturing overhaul has coincided with cutting 24,000 jobs worldwide through buyouts, divestitures, layoffs and attrition. Though P&G is hiring factory workers at some sites, nearly 10,000 of the jobs eliminated in the last five years were from its manufacturing network. “Supply chain transformation is in its early stages," Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller told analysts at a conference earlier this month. Right now, P&G is focusing on North America, before shifting in order to Europe, Latin America and finally India, the Middle East and Africa, he said. In the United States, P&G closed factories earlier this year in Augusta, Georgia and Cayey, Puerto Rico; this summer, it announced a chemicals factory in Avenel, New Jersey would close in 2018 and be sold. The company owns three other chemical plants in North America, which are located in suburban Chicago; Sacramento, California; and the Ivorydale campus in St. Bernard. More closures could be announced as P&G prepares next year to open a West Virginia factory that is currently under construction. P&G is spending $500 million on the new facility in Berkeley County, located in the state's eastern panhandle. "P&G is really looking to maximize their efficiency with significant up-front investments in factories, but that means the closure of less-efficient plants in time," said Leon Loewenstine, chief investment strategist at Downtown-based Riverpoint Capital Management. Besides the pending Coty deal, P&G has shed factories through its sale of the Iams pet food and Duracell battery brands. The company is spending a half-billion dollars to build a large factory in West Virginia's Eastern Panhandle and investing millions in expanding other plants. P&G officials say the plant that’s as large as the Kenwood Towne Centre will make Pantene shampoo, Olay body wash and Bounce fabric enhancers as the company emphasizes facilities that can produce a variety of products for different business units. In Utah, P&G officials have said it is spending $500 million to double the size of its paper plant there and add 200 new jobs, but have not disclosed what other products will be made by the super-sized plant. Michael Magazine, a professer of operations and business analytics at the University of Cincinnati, said it's cheaper for a manufacturer to operate larger but fewer factories. It saves money on labor, equipment, utilities, supplies, maintenance and financing. P&G has signaled some of its North American factories will not only survive, but grow. The company’s fabric care plant in Lima, Ohio, about 130 miles north of P&G's headquarters, has already been expanded and the company said the Avenel operations will be consolidated there. Similarly, P&G’s Greensboro, North Carolina plant has picked up work from the now-shuttered beauty brand factory in Puerto Rico. Moeller added that while P&G is spending a lot of money on factories now, savings will come. "We're in investment mode now with savings to ramp up in two, three and four years," Moeller said. The investment in added production North American capabilities comes as P&G has amassed an eye-popping $13.3 billion of cash and securities on its balance sheet, yet its U.S. sales are relatively flat at $27 billion. P&G officials acknowledged the company’s ongoing review of its supply chain but declined to discuss specific potential factory closings for this story.

Last year, P&G sold its Nenagh plant to US cosmetics firm Coty, having operated the facility since 1978. Around 250 staff are employed at the plant and were informed in a staff meeting held in the wake of the sale last year that they would remain as P&G employees until the end of 2016, when the deal is finalised, at which point they will become Coty employees. Following the announced sale, Siptu lodged a claim for a loyalty payment for its Nenagh-based members. The Labour Court has now recommended that workers at the plant receive a one-off loyalty payment ranging from €5,500 to €12,500 each. READ NEXT Firms lose Luas court appeal In its argument before the Labour Court, Siptu said P&G is a multinational that could easily afford to make a satisfactory, once-off gratuity to its Nenagh staff to acknowledge their contribution. Siptu was seeking €2,500 per year of service. P&G said employees’ loyalty has already been rewarded over the years. It said there is no contractual or statutory entitlement to a one-off loyalty payment for staff in a transfer situation, nor is there a custom, practice, or policy in the history of P&G. In its recommendation, the Labour Court noted “the profound effect on the workforce of the proposed transfer of ownership of the business”. It stated that it also noted the need for full co-operation by the workforce to efficiently bring about that transfer. “Finally, the court notes the precedent established in the 2008/09 downsizing agreement, in which compensation for co-operation with change was conceded by the company.” The Labour Court stated that in that context and in return for full co-operation with the transfer of the business to the new owners, it was recommending the company pay a range of amounts to affected workers. It recommended that P&G staff with less than five years’ service receive €5,500; staff with five but less than 15 years’ service receive €8,000; and staff with 15 or more years’ service receive €12,500. The most recent accounts for P&G (Manufacturing) Ireland Ltd, which also operates a plant in Newbridge, Co Kildare, show that it recorded pre-tax profits of €11.68m last year.

"Lower for longer is a good thing for the equity markets," Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago, told Reuters. "It basically says risk back on.” In 3.08pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 0.8 percent. In 2.54pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.6 percent. Gains in shares of Procter & Gamble and those of United Technologies, recently trading 1.2 percent and 1.1 percent stronger respectively, spearheaded the advance of the Dow. Bucking the trend were shares of Pfizer and those of DuPont, down 0.4 percent and 0.3 percent respectively, for the only declines in the Dow in afternoon trading. US Treasuries were steady, with the 10-year note yielding 1.64 percent. “The strategy going forward is to buy duration on dips for investors who agree with us that economic activity and inflation data are unlikely to strengthen into year-end,” Jabaz Mathai, a rates strategist at Citigroup in New York, wrote in a research note, according to Bloomberg. There were fresh signs of strength in the US jobs market. A Labor Department report showed that initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 252,000 for the week ended September 17. “The economy is stronger than we thought with another turn tighter of the screw for the labour market," Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. “If Fed officials are waiting for the economy to improve further before raising rates, they are just too late.” Meanwhile, some say the US greenback is set to weaken. "The US dollar decline has more weeks to go, we think about two months," Hans Redeker, Morgan Stanley’s chief global currency strategist in London, told Bloomberg. "We suggest that the US dollar will extend its decline, index-wise, between 4 percent to 5 percent." In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with an increase of 1.6 percent from the previous close.

While you were sleeping: Nasdaq touches record high Sept. 23 (BusinessDesk) – Wall Street climbed, pushing the Nasdaq to a fresh intraday record high, as investors repositioned themselves after the US Federal Reserve kept its target interest rate steady and hinted at a potential December hike. “Lower for longer is a good thing for the equity markets,” Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago, told Reuters. “It basically says risk back on.” In 3.08pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 0.8 percent. In 2.54pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.6 percent. Gains in shares of Procter & Gamble and those of United Technologies, recently trading 1.2 percent and 1.1 percent stronger respectively, spearheaded the advance of the Dow. Bucking the trend were shares of Pfizer and those of DuPont, down 0.4 percent and 0.3 percent respectively, for the only declines in the Dow in afternoon trading. US Treasuries were steady, with the 10-year note yielding 1.64 percent. “The strategy going forward is to buy duration on dips for investors who agree with us that economic activity and inflation data are unlikely to strengthen into year-end,” Jabaz Mathai, a rates strategist at Citigroup in New York, wrote in a research note, according to Bloomberg. There were fresh signs of strength in the US jobs market. A Labor Department report showed that initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 252,000 for the week ended September 17. “The economy is stronger than we thought with another turn tighter of the screw for the labour market,” Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. “If Fed officials are waiting for the economy to improve further before raising rates, they are just too late.” Meanwhile, some say the US greenback is set to weaken. “The US dollar decline has more weeks to go, we think about two months,” Hans Redeker, Morgan Stanley’s chief global currency strategist in London, told Bloomberg. “We suggest that the US dollar will extend its decline, index-wise, between 4 percent to 5 percent.” In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with an increase of 1.6 percent from the previous close. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index advanced 1.1 percent, while Germany’s DAX index and France’s CAC 40 index each rallied 2.3 percent. “The good thing about Europe is that it’s not that expensive and it has the possibility of earnings delivering more than expectations,” Pierre Mouton, a fund manager at Notz, Stucki & Cie in Geneva, told Bloomberg. “The strategists are probably getting less pessimistic, with a good chunk of bad news already behind us.

(Photo: Provided/The Christ Hospital) Lynwood Battle has never met a stranger. Maybe it’s his smiling eyes or the calm, thoughtful way he speaks that makes him so likeable. Or maybe it’s his engaging manner and humble, grateful attitude. Just ask him and he’ll tell you every moment he has is a gift. He’s got that glass-half-full outlook, but it stems from a purely harrowing experience more than two decades ago. Lynwood was young and healthy. Despite being a little overweight he led an almost storied life. He graduated from The Ohio State University, where he played sousaphone in the marching band and even dotted the “i” in “Ohio.” He earned two Bronze Star Medals in the military. His careers with Procter & Gamble and his family’s mortuary service were ex­ceedingly noteworthy, as was his relentless devotion to his community. Then one day everything changed. Lynwood’s heart malfunctioned. He developed heart failure, where the heart muscle becomes weakened and loses its ability to pump enough blood to supply the body’s needs. Doctors believe his heart failure was triggered by a viral infection. Heart failure affects over 5 million Americans, is one of the fastest-growing heart issues, and is the leading cause of hospitalization in people over age 65. But Lynwood wasn’t 65. Not even close. “I really didn’t know what was in my future,” Lyn­wood said. So he brought his concerns to Dr. Edward J. Schloss at The Christ Hospital’s Heart & Vascular Center. “Dr. Schloss said, ‘We’ll take care of you,’ and I trusted that they would – and they did,” Lynwood said. With a name like Battle, he was ready for a fight. Lynwood began a regimen of medications – a heart failure cocktail – and attended patient education classes. Dr. Schloss put in an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, which shocks the heart back into normal rhythm during life-threatening situations. Lynwood credits that ICD for saving his life many times. “I call it my bionic buddy,” Lynwood laughed. “It has fired appropriately a number of times, and if it hadn’t, well, I wouldn’t be here today.” Lynwood also found a friend and advocate in heart failure specialist Dr. Gregory Egnaczyk. Dr. Egnaczyk reduced Lynwood’s medications and referred him to Cardiac Rehab, where he exercises with the safety net of medical professionals on-site. “When I can’t get in there, I feel there’s something missing from my day,” Lynwood said. He’s lost 100 pounds, now manages his diabetes strictly through diet and exercise, and has reduced the level of his CPAP machine for sleep apnea. Lynwood also attends Heartworks, a monthly educa­tion and support group provided by The Christ Hos­pital, offering patients and their families meaningful information about heart failure and its management. “They listen to you and sometimes you just want to talk about what’s going on,” Lynwood said. Now, thanks to the experts at The Christ Hospital, Lynwood, 73, feels better than ever. He even returned to The Ohio State University where he dotted the “i” for an alumni game, “to do it one more time” – some­thing he thought he’d never do again. “You’re never too old to make a change,” Lynwood said. “Any outcome that adds a minute to your life or gets me to my goal of seeing my grandchildren gradu­ate and get married is worth it.” Dr. Dean Kereiakes  (Photo: Provided/The Christ Hospital Network) Related:  MD Insider featuring Dean Kereiakes, MD Q: What causes heart failure? A: Heart failure (HF) can develop slowly over time as the result of other conditions (such as high blood pres­sure, coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease or viral infections) that weaken the heart muscle. HF can also result from heart muscle damaged during a heart attack. Q: What are the symptoms? A: Many patients first experience fatigue and/or shortness of breath during normal daily activities, which they may dismiss as a sign of aging. Other symp­toms include wheezing or coughing, fluid retention and weight gain, loss of appetite, and abnormally fast or slow heart rate. Q: What is unique about heart failure care offered by The Christ Hospital Physicians? A: We offer a dedicated HF team and specialized unit, The Carl H. & Edyth Lindner Heart Failure Treatment Center, the only in-patient program in the region to focus only on HF treatment. Our program offers ad­vanced care for the entire spectrum of HF, including leading-edge medical management, advanced devices, clinical research trials, and ongoing support for life­style modifications. Q: What’s new in HF treatment? A: Telehealth options are now available to help monitor HF patients at home so they avoid unnecessary hospitalizations or trips to their physician. We also offer advanced device treatments such as Left Ventric­ular Assist Devices (LVAD), an implant that supports the heart in patients waiting for a heart transplant or suffering from end-stage HF. Our program recently celebrated 100 patients living better lives, thanks to our amaz­ing team and technology. New treatments for HF occurring after heart attack include: • Regenerative therapies utilizing a patient’s own stem cells evaluated to repair and/or replace heart tissue damaged or lost during a heart attack. • The novel Parachute™ Device, the first minimally invasive treatment to partition damaged heart muscle from normal muscle, restoring heart function and im­proving quality of life. Q:What advice do you have for anyone suffering from HF? A: Seek care by a specialist focused in HF. Our talented team of HF physicians are easily accessible in locations throughout the Tristate.

The acquisition show the increasing importance of ethics to the consumer market and represents a shift in values toward sustainability for Unilever. “Seventh Generation has long been a disruptor in the US marketplace, leading the industry in sustainable innovation while attracting new generations of conscious consumers,” Nitin Paranjpe, president of Unilever’s home care division, said in a statement. “This addition to Unilever’s product portfolio will help us meet rising demand for high-quality products with a purpose.” Recommended:Earth Day: Are you saving the planet or just showing off? Take our quiz. The sale could give Unilever, valued at $136.2 billion, an advantage in a US market largely held by its rival company Procter & Gamble. Seventh Generation, which made $200 million in sales last year, could now have access to a larger pool of consumers for its increasingly in-demand products.

Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/18 “We look at this as having a multiplier effect for our business,” Seventh Generation Chief Executive John Replogle, who will stay on to run the company, told The Wall Street Journal. “We always aspired to be a billion-dollar brand. We see this as a springboard as opposed to throwing in the towel.” Some are worried about the partnership, as startups don’t always retain their original mission once bought by publicly traded companies. But Unilever has historically taken a hands-off approach when it has acquired new companies – like it was seen to do after it bought Ben & Jerry’s in 2000. Additionally, Unilever acquired the environmentally friendly Dollar Shave Club in July for $1 billion, and is reported to be in talks to buy Jessica Alba’s Honest Company, which sells nontoxic household products. The acquisition of companies aimed at environmentally conscious buyers symbolizes a dramatic turnaround for Unilever, which in 2008 was accused of contributing to the destruction of the Borneo Rainforest in Indonesia by buying palm oil, a key ingredient in many processed food and personal care products, from companies that engaged in illegal deforestation. At the time, Unilever was the largest purchaser of palm oil in the world.  The advocacy group Greenpeace led a campaign against Unilever's participation in the rainforest destruction, which was seen as causing harm to native people and wildlife. Unilever responded by dropping contracts with the palm oil producers in question and lobbying its competitors Kraft, Nestlé, Cadbury, Cargill, and Proctor & Gamble to do the same. "Unilever's decision could represent a defining moment for the palm oil industry.” John Sauven, Greenpeace executive director, said in a statement in 2009.  "What we're seeing here is the world's largest buyer of palm oil using its financial muscle to sanction suppliers who are destroying rainforests and clearing peatlands. This has set a new standard for others to follow." In the years since, Unilever has been involved in efforts to promote sustainable palm oil production and it was Unilever's commitment to reducing its environmental impact that made the Seventh Generation CEO to say that the two companies would make good partners. “Today marks the next chapter and we’re proud to join Unilever and its shared vision for purpose-led business on a global scale,” Replogle said in a statement. “Working together we are confident we can have a positive impact on the health of billions of people around the world, truly fulfilling our mission of nurturing the next seven generations while transforming global commerce.” Next up Earth Day: Are you saving the planet or just showing off?

Frankie Bridge reveals she works out EVERY DAY as she shows off her honed figure in a new beauty campaign Frankie told FEMAIL that hanging out with her boys makes her happiest Revealed she tries to work out every day and eats a clean diet Says being a mum makes her think about what’s worth worrying about By Bianca London for MailOnline Published: 03:57 EST, 21 September 2016 | Updated: 04:09 EST, 21 September 2016 e-mail 50 View comments She's become one of the most successful female British pop stars after finding fame with S Club Juniors but you're more likely to find Frankie Bridge cuddled up at home with her children than on the red carpet these days. The 27-year-old, who has two young sons with her footballer husband Wayne, told FEMAIL that hanging out with her boys makes her feel at her happiest.  'It's the little things that make me feel super these days,' she said. 'Like simply hanging out with the boys, getting to spend quality time with them is so special, especially as they’re growing up and we’re getting to see how funny, cheeky and lovely they are.'   Frankie Bridge, who is supporting the Superdrug and P&G FeelSuper Campaign, which raises funds for Marie Curie, shows off her honed figure in the campaign shoot - and shares her workout secrets with FEMAIL Frankie, who found fame as a child, says that motherhood has 'massively' changed her life and the concept of being 'busy' has totally changed as a result.  She explained: 'I now have two little boys to think about all the time and they’re always the first thing I think about when planning our week, or work schedules or anything! I always thought I was busy before but now as a mum, still working, I realise that this is busy.  'Being a mum is amazing though, it really makes you think about what’s worth worrying about and what isn’t.'

Share this article Share Frankie, who put on a glamorous display at London Fashion Week this weekend, says that while she has less time to go to glamorous parties now, it does actually make her them appreciate more. 'I now get to be a mum not really caring about what I look like when out with the boys, and then I get to dress up and get glam for a fun night out. I really appreciate that I get to have both – I love being a mum at home and I love getting glam,' she said.  Frankie, who found fame as a child, says that motherhood has 'massively' changed her life and the concept of being 'busy' has totally changed The star, who still speaks to The Saturdays girls 'all the time' in their Whatsapp group, has also been keeping busy filming a documentary about internet trolls Frankie certainly knows how to get her glam on; she worked a thigh-grazing mini-skirt which cinched in her tiny waist to flaunt her hourglass figure to it's fullest at the Jasper Conran show. So what's her secret? 'Wayne and I give each other an hour a day or every few days to each go to the gym while the other stays with the boys,' said Frankie, who swears by Pilates classes, boxing with friends and TRX. She also follows a clean diet, opting for natural yogurt with granola and berries for breakfast followed by around an hour’s workout, a salad for lunch and then a stir fry for dinner. The star, who still speaks to The Saturdays girls 'all the time' in their Whatsapp group, has also been keeping busy filming a documentary about internet trolls after meeting some victims who had been targeted online.  Frankie is mother to two-year-old Parker, left, and Carter, right, and says being a mother is what makes her feel at her best She explained: 'With a team I then tracked down the trolls and confronted them about the things they’d said/things they’d done to see how they’d react when confronted face to face.  'The result was exactly what you would expect – none of the attackers had any justification for their actions and tried to shy away from the damage they had done. By joining the team, I was hoping to show victims that they shouldn’t be scared of these trolls.  'It’s so nice that I’m in the position where I get to try lots of different things and have a go at things I’ve never done before. Filming the documentary was a real first and I enjoyed doing something with a serious topic.  'I’ve been in music since I was 12 so it’s great that I now have the opportunity to branch out a little. It also means that I have more time at home with the boys which I love and that I have time to help real causes like this one. 'The Feel Super is campaign is all about raising money for the amazing work Marie Curie nurses do for terminally ill patients and their families. Last year we raise £200,000 which is enough to fund 10 nurses, this year I’ve once again teamed up with P&G and Superdrug to raise even more. 'It’s also really simple to get involved so I don’t feel like I’m asking a lot. People can help Marie Curie simply by buying the everyday beauty products they’d be buying from Superdrug anyway so it’s so easy to donate!'  Frankie explained that she follows a clean diet, opting for natural yogurt with granola and berries for breakfast followed by around an hour’s workout, a salad for lunch and then a stir fry for dinner   Share or comment on this article e-mail Most watched News videos Autistic boy bursts into tears on stage as teacher snatches microphone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Good pup!

The Gamble House, a living, untouched example of the Arts and Crafts Style, is celebrating 50-years since its owners donated the landmark estate for preservation. Tonight, guests will celebrate at a party on the grounds and preview a new documentary about the House produced by longtime Disney producer Donald Hahn (The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, more). Then on September 25, The Gamble House will host a public party with $1 tours, food and entertainment for all. The turn-of-the-century estate represented one of the finest examples the Arts and Crafts Movement when completed and lives as a historic landmark to this day. “There’s no way that this house could be truly reproduced today. It’s not for lack of the craftsmen. It’s the materials that existed 120 years ago are simply not available today. That’s what really makes this a special place and so important to conserve exactly as it is,” says Gamble House Director, Ted Bosley. Architects Charles and Henry Greene created the Gamble House in 1908 for David and Mary Gamble of Ohio as a winter residence for the heirs to the Proctor and Gamble household products fortune. The 8,000 square foot house took ten months to build for approximately $50,000 at the time. “It was really on the high end at that time,” said Bosley. “What Charles and Henry Greene brought to this place was a very personal expression of their ideal in building and design.” The house would remain under ownership of the Gambles until the surviving members of the family deeded the house to the city of Pasadena in a joint agreement with the University of Southern California School of Architecture in 1966 after realizing the artistic importance of the house as a surviving example of Greene and Greene, according to the Gamble House website. “There is so much detail and so much care focused on every corner of this house that it’s the kind of place that rewards repeat visits. It’s a very personal expression of architecture. It was a total work of art,” said Gamble House Director Ted Bosley. The Gamble family donated the home and all the furnishings along with it, as they were originally crafted for the project. “It’s the only Greene and Green house that remains today with all of its furnishings,” explained Bosley. ‘What’s really remarkable is that more than one hundred years later we have just about exactly what the Gambles walked into in 1909.” The unique details that are appreciated not only for the complexity of its time, but also for the originality it presents, are seen in every square inch of the property. “The way the wood is chosen for function and the decorative woods that are used—all of those are expressed very distinctly. It really does end up being a total work of art, a symphony of wood,” said Bosley. Greene and Greene implemented their personal style that was both functional and modern and almost entirely comprised of wood. “The architects felt that it was important to let natural materials speak in their own language—to show their natural characteristics,” said Bosley who explained that the wood was only treated with light finishes and never painted. The house features many kinds of wood including Douglas fir for the structure; Burmese teak in the entry hall and the living room, the kitchen boasts maple wood and sugar pine countertops, Honduran mahogany in the dining room and California redwood panels in the living room. “Thoughtful details like that were always in the minds of the architects as they were designing these rooms and choosing the woods that were most appropriate for the various functions,” said Bosley. The Gamble House was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1978 and has since become a premier historic site in the nation. It is open to the public and also offers specialty tours and programs. The 50th Anniversary public celebration kicks off Sunday, September 25th from noon to 4 p.m. at the Gamble House at Number-4 Westmoreland Place. Tickets are available first come; first serve on site the day of the event.

The number of S&P 500 companies with buybacks over $1 billion dropped to a 3-year low in the second quarter of 2016, according to data released by FactSet this week. Overall, fewer companies were opting to buy back any stock at all, marking the lowest participation rate since the end of 2010. Microsoft announced Wednesday that it was authorizing up to $40 billion in buybacks. (The software company did not reveal a timeframe for the buybacks and told CNBC it has "nothing further to share" on timing.) In the last quarter, we've seen other big spenders including Apple ($10.9 billion) and GE ($7.6 billion). Those two companies are also leading the market for most stock repurchased in the last 12 months. In the last decade, companies have spent large sums on stock buybacks, which are often used to boost the price of the remaining shares and to prop up per-share earnings. Despite the decline in buybacks last quarter, S&P 500 companies are still using an extremely large amount of their income to buy back their own shares. They spent nearly 72 percent of net income over the last 12 months on buybacks — up about 17 percent from a year ago. With debt high and earnings expected to fall, buybacks will likely be even less affordable in coming quarters, especially if the U.S. Federal Reserve decides to raise interest rates. Put Microsoft's $40 billion purchase in context: If the company does buy that full amount, and it doesn't reissue any of those shares, then that $40 billion alone would be bigger than most S&P 500 companies have done in total over the last 10 years. Only 14 companies in the S&P 500 have spent at least $40 billion in net stock buybacks over the past decade. The leaders include ExxonMobil ($189 billion), Apple ($111 billion), IBM ($109 billion), Microsoft ($101 billion), Walmart ($66 billion), Pfizer ($60 billion), Procter and Gamble ($48 billion), Home Depot ($47 billion), and HP ($47 billion). There is some evidence that buybacks may not help support a company's share price over the long term. FactSet's data showed that companies with repurchase programs have underperformed the S&P 500 in the past year by more than 5 percentage points. The Fed decided to leave rates unchanged in its September meeting on Wednesday, but if credit tightens, more companies may find that burning cash or taking out debt for buybacks simply aren't worth the cost.

By Josh Kolm September 22, 2016 Publicis Groupe has announced a number of new leadership appointments within its Publicis Communications division that will see a number of agency leaders, including several from Canada, receiving expanded roles. Publicis Communications is one of four “solutions hubs” the holding company created as part of a restructuring announced late last year and includes all of the group’s advertising and creative agencies: Publicis Worldwide, MSL, Nurun, Saatchi & Saatchi, Leo Burnett, BBH, Marcel and production hub Prodigious. The new model was meant to make agencies within each “hub” more collaborative with each other in their work with clients. Andrew Bruce (pictured, left), previously North American CEO of Publicis Worlwide and a former CEO of Publicis Worldwide Canada, has been named North American CEO of Publicis Communications. Kurt Ritter, previously chairman and CEO of Saatchi & Saatchi LA and Team One and chairman of Saatchi & Saatchi Canada, will be chairman for North America, while Suellen Ravanas, EVP and CFO for Leo Burnett in North America, will be Publicis Communications’ CFO for the region. In addition, Carla Serrano, CEO of Publicis New York and Bill Kanarick, chief strategy officer of the holding company’s digitally focused group Publicis.Sapient, have been named co-CSOs of Publicis Communications. The move is meant to foster collaboration between agencies within Publicis Communications and those within Publicis.Sapient, which include Sapient, DigitasLBi and Razorfish. At the agency level, Judy John will retain her role as Leo Burnett Canada’s CEO, but has now been named chief creative officer for Leo across North America. Brent Nelsen, Canada’s chief strategy officer, has also had his role expanded to cover the agency’s offices across North America. John and Nelsen will work with the global leadership team of Rich Stoddart – the agency’s previous North American CEO who was named Tom Bernardin’s successor as global CEO in January – and Mark Tutssel, global CCO. Leo Burnett in particular has already been highly collaborative in recent years, with the Canadian office working with talent from offices worldwide on clients like P&G. Arthur Sadoun, CEO of Publicis Communications, said in a press release that the new appointments are meant to “accelerate” early momentum the group has seen from business wins in the first nine months since it was formed, as well as to encourage further collaboration by having less burdensome leadership structures at the local level. Other Publicis Communications agencies have seen similar appointments. Valérie Henaff, CEO of Publicis Worldwide’s Publicis Conseil in France, has also been named the agency’s global president. At Saatchi & Saatchi, global CCO Kate Stanners will also serve as the agency’s global chairwoman.

After the quoted lines, below Levy told the crowd at Goldman Sachs that the Publicis board will START succession proceedings in November, with Levy’s retirement still scheduled for February 2017: “And regarding succession, the Board will start mid-November, end of November, latest will be announcement in February and we will have a good succession.” * Last night MediaPost (!) reported on a Goldman Sachs media conference in New York at which Maurice Levy told attendees that he might name his successor as Publicis Groupe’s global chief as early as November even though he’s not supposed to retire until next May. Who will it be? He’s not giving any hints. But he is making some jokes! “Should I play a role or not? Probably yes. What kind of role? Maybe doorman. The uniform is beautiful and that is what people are probably expecting of me.” Addressing the holding company’s recent losses, especially on the media side, he admitted that Publicis has yet to make up for that missing revenue. As evidence of a comeback, he cited the HP Enterprise win we broke last month, but that client only spent $13.6 million in the first quarter of this year, so it’s not quite P&G. Now who will replace him, again? Lots of people are saying Arthur Sadoun, though Campaign also floats Steve King of Publicis Media and Allan Herrick of Sapient.Nitro. (It’s going to be Sadoun. Calling it now, so put us down for $3.50.) We also hear of some fairly big internal changes coming to the Publicis Communications organization … but something tells us you will be disappointed anyway. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

While you were sleeping: Fed signals December hike Margreet Dietz Thursday September 22, 2016 Share Play NBR radio on US stocks and longer-dated debt rose, while the greenback weakened, after the Federal Reserve kept its target interest rate unchanged but signalled a hike later this year. "The committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened but decided, for the time being, to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives," the Federal Open Market Committee says. Three officials – Esther George, Loretta Mester, and Eric Rosengren – voted against keeping the fed funds rate steady, each of whom preferred to raise the target range a quarter point to between 0.5 and 0.75 %. Shorter-dated US government debt fell while 10-year Treasuries rose, reflecting expectations that investors are toning down bets on Fed rate hikes further down the road. "Our decision does not reflect a lack of confidence in the economy," Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen said at the start of her press conference, Bloomberg reported. "Since monetary policy is only modestly accommodative, there appears little risk of falling behind the curve in the near future." Yields on the 10-year note fell two basis points to 1.67%, while yields on two-year notes rose two basis points to 0.79%. "That really stands out that they've become significantly more dovish in their projection materials, but clearly trying to signal to the market that December is very much live," New York-based Credit Agricole head of fixed-income strategy David Keeble told Bloomberg. "It's looking very likely we'll get one this year, but after that it goes flat." Wall Street also moved higher. In 2.56pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.5%. In 2.41pm trading, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index climbed 0.5%. Investors are positioning for a rate increase at the end of the year. "The body language makes it sound like they're warming people up for December," Stephen Massocca, chief investment officer at Wedbush Equity Management in San Francisco, told Reuters. The Dow advanced as gains in Chevron and Boeing shares traded 1.5 % stronger, outweighing declines Procter & Gamble and Walt Disney shares, down 2.1% and 1.1% respectively. Shares of FedEx were up 6.8% at 3.08pm in New York, after the shipping company upgraded its full-year earnings forecast, and offered an upbeat outlook on the impact of its acquisition of TNT Express. "The integration of TNT Express is proceeding smoothly, and the level of team members' engagement is outstanding," Frederick Smith, FedEx chief executive officer, says. "Managing our operating companies as a portfolio of customer solutions helped FedEx achieve strong financial and operating results in the quarter, especially given global economies continued low growth." In Europe, the UK's FTSE 100 Index eked out a 0.1% gain, Germany's DAX index added 0.4%, while France's CAC 40 index rose 0.5%. (BusinessDesk)   Got a question about this story?

"That really stands out that they’ve become significantly more dovish in their projection materials, but clearly trying to signal to the market that December is very much live,” David Keeble, New York-based head of fixed-income strategy at Credit Agricole, told Bloomberg. “It’s looking very likely we’ll get one this year, but after that it goes flat.” Wall Street also moved higher. In 2.56pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.4 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.5 percent. In 2.41pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.5 percent. Investors are positioning for a rate increase at the end of the year. "The body language makes it sound like they're warming people up for December," Stephen Massocca, chief investment officer at Wedbush Equity Management in San Francisco, told Reuters. The Dow advanced as gains in shares of Chevron and those of Boeing, recently each trading 1.5 percent stronger, outweighed declines in shares of Procter & Gamble and those of Walt Disney, down 2.1 percent and 1.1 percent respectively. Shares of FedEx jumped, up 6.8 percent as of 3.08pm in New York, after the shipping company upgraded its full-year earnings forecast, and offered an upbeat outlook on the impact of its acquisition of TNT Express. “The integration of TNT Express is proceeding smoothly, and the level of team members’ engagement is outstanding,” Frederick Smith, FedEx chief executive officer, said in a statement. “Managing our operating companies as a portfolio of customer solutions helped FedEx achieve strong financial and operating results in the quarter, especially given the global economy’s continued low growth.” In Europe, the UK’s FTSE 100 Index eked out a 0.1 percent gain, Germany’s DAX index added 0.4 percent, while France’s CAC 40 index rose 0.5 percent.

Eric Volkman (TMFVolkman) Sep 21, 2016 at 12:49PM What happened? Unilever (NYSE:UL) is going the green route with its latest acquisition. The global consumer goods company announced this week that it has agreed to purchase privately held Seventh Generation, a maker of eco-friendly household products. Neither the price nor the terms of the deal were disclosed. However, a report in Fortune, citing "a source familiar with the deal", said that the purchase price is between $600 million and $700 million.  Image source: Seventh Generation.  In the press release announcing the acquisition, the president of Unilever's home care business characterized its asset-to-be as "a disruptor in the U.S. marketplace", adding that "[t]his addition to Unilever's product portfolio will help us meet rising demand for high-quality products with a purpose." Does it matter? Seventh Generation products enjoy good visibility, occupying plenty of shelf real estate in American stores. According to Unilever, the private company's sales topped $200 million last year, with compound annual growth in the double digits over the past decade. A more promising figure is the company's sales structure -- around 95% of its revenue is derived from North America. Under the Unilever umbrella, Seventh Generation has the potential to grow much larger as its new parent company pushes to make the brand the default green option in markets all over the world. Owning Seventh Generation boosts Unilever's overall competitiveness against eternal rival Procter & Gamble. In contrast to Unilever's recent acquisition activity, Procter & Gamble has been shedding assets instead of acquiring them. Despite that, Procter & Gamble has been the better-performing stock of late, rising by over 11% year-to-date compared to Unilever's 7% gain. News of the Seventh Generation deal comes on the heels of speculation that Unilever is interested in pursuing The Honest Company, another green products purveyor. Whether or not a deal for that company is in the cards, it's obvious that Unilever is serious about beefing up its product lines in this niche. Seventh Generation, with its past success and its future potential, seems like a sensible move in that direction. Eric Volkman has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Brooklyn, New York-based retailer Matt Mazzone’s idea to sell chocolate for charity has been a huge hit. It started out local, and sweetened into a national program whereby Ace stores across the country have generated more than $600,000 for Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals. For his leadership, his fundraising and his community involvement, Mazzone is the 2016 Ace All-Star Retailer. "... Giving back to our communities is something ingrained in our DNA.”"I am truly humbled and honored to be named the 2016 All-Star Retailer, and would like to give credit to my incredible team,” said Mazzone, owner of Mazzone Ace Hardware in Brooklyn. “I think I speak for Ace retailers across the organization when I say that giving back to our communities is something ingrained in our DNA, it is done without expectation of recognition or award.” This national award honors one Ace retailer annually for his or her extraordinary fundraising, leadership skills, innovation and commitment to Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals  – Ace’s national philanthropy of choice. Mazzone was nominated by his local CMN Hospital, Cohen Children’s Medical Center. The co-op says Mazzone was selected for his exemplary fundraising for Cohen Children’s Medical Center and his efforts to influence and engage Ace stores across the country to fundraise for Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals. The idea to use World’s Finest Chocolate Bars as a fund raiser – an idea that took off across the co-op – led to the sale of 1.2 million bars, generating more than $600,000 for CMN Hospitals across the country in just 16 months. In addition, Mazzone hosts an annual Pumpkinfest event for his store’s neighborhood community. This fun-filled event has become a local tradition for many families with proceeds benefitting Cohen Children’s Medical Center. The event includes pumpkin decorating, pony rides, face painting, music, food and raffles. As part of Mazzone’s recognition, P&G and Duracell will donate $25,000 in his name to Cohen Children’s Medical Center. In addition, Cabot Creamery will host Mazzone on their 2017 Cabot Community Celebrity Cruise to Alaska. Like Ace, Cabot Creamery is a cooperative that believes in rewarding influential leaders like Mazzone for their contributions to communities and society. “I would like to thank our store associates, my fellow Ace retailers, the Ace Foundation team, and Ace’s management for their encouragement and continued support of Children's Miracle Network Hospitals,” said Mazzone. “We are proud to recognize Matt Mazzone as Ace’s third-annual All-Star Retailer,” said Kane Calamari, president of the Ace Hardware Foundation. “Not only has Matt been instrumental in raising funds for his local hospital, Cohen Children’s Medical Center, but he has also been a visionary catalyst within our organization spurring incredible fundraising growth across the entire Ace enterprise.” Login or Register to post a comment. ﻿ Newsletter Sign Up Get the latest news sent to your inbox   Product Video Network Spray Nine Heavy-Duty Cleaner + Degreaser + Disinfectant What makes Spray Nine a triple threat?

RELATED COMPANIES EXPAND ADD TO Portfolio Watchlist OUTLOOK? +ve -ve Unilever x Loading data... ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ Colgate Palmolive x Loading data... ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ By Anand Lunia and Shailesh Vikram Singh 'The Amazon of India will be Amazon and not Flipkart or any other company' is a routine assertion by experts warning of the onslaught of global companies. These experts are using the recent non-performance of investors in India to say that the Indian entrepreneur and the Indian market are not capable of very much. The Indian internet market, which started opening up in 1998, has been through a classical evolution, just like in the rest of the world. The first off the block were classifieds, jobs and travel companies. Even as domestic startups tried to seize the first-mover advantage, global players (read US companies) jumped into the fray. And going by today's arguments, the Monster.com of India should have been Monster-.com. But it is not. Naukri (the jobs portal launched by internet company Info-Edge) has seven times the traffic of Monster India. The US company entered India soon after the Naukri IPO, and even bought an Indian job portal in 2004. Later, a lot of pundits said LinkedIn will wipe out Naukri, which was hurt in a few segments for sure, but held on to its main service of bulk hiring. Meanwhile, Monster was sold for a value less than Naukri's market capitalisation and LinkedIn sold recently to Microsoft. MakeMyTrip was the first consumer-internet startup from India to list on the Nasdaq in 2010. Its thin margins meant that it should have long lost to global biggies. But it hasn''t. Travelocity bought Travelguru, and had some interesting ad campaigns, but shut down India operations in 2013. Expedia has been making noises for a few years, but is yet to make any headway. Both these sectors had no India-specific trade barrier, the competitors were cash-rich and had access to armies of 'better' quality talent from Silicon Valley. In a world away from technology, Patanjali is the most interesting comeback of the Indian entrepreneur. Colgate Palmolive, Unilever and P&G have had an almost free run in India, with an occasional challenge from players like Nirma. But the phenomenal growth of Patanjali that has completely outflanked even the fabled distribution moat of global FMCG companies has taken everyone by surprise. Patanjali did not poach top talent, did not give big incentives to retailers and did not sign up celebrities to endorse, practically making the standard playbook of FMCGs look like a copy of nursery rhymes. Colgate-Palmolive India reported its worst sales growth in 44 quarters recently and Hindustan Unilever's revenue expanded at the weakest pace in more than six years. And in a huge validation of the size of the Indian market, Patanjali has grown to a revenue of Rs 5,000 crore in just five years and continues to grow at more than 100% a year. Another famous battle has been that of Uber and Ola in India. Ola in these conversations is the supposed loser, which is indulging in wasteful discounts and providing poor service. Interestingly though, Uber pays more to its drivers and is cheaper for its consumers, but consumers use Ola as much as they use Uber. Most of the outperformance of Uber is just perception as of now, with capital as the main tool. Experts are now predicting a reckoning for Indian startups as inevitable and that it lies just 12-18 months away, citing the example of Amazon. This while discounting has been the only real and effective strategy used by Amazon in India. Amazon is winning customers in India because it offers more discounts and not because of any secret sauce. And this will not be enough as a long-term strategy for the US company. Amazon and all such capital-led players are just waiting for their Patanjali moment. (Anand Lunia, is general partner at India Quotient; Shailesh Vikram Singh is executive director at Seedfund.

Opinion: Millennial cosmetics IPO offers potentially beautiful returns MarketWatch 9/22/2016 Michael Brush © Phillip Waterman/Getty Images Young women window shopping, taking photograph with smartphone A lot of companies have a hard time connecting with two key consumer groups: millennials and Hispanics. Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 110.12 +0.17 +0.15% Abercrombie & Fitch Co ANF ▼ 14.62 -2.32 -13.67% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 758.93 +2.53 +0.33% Ross Stores Inc ROST ▲ 68.03 +2.50 +3.81% So it’s worth taking a look — and consider buying shares — when you find one that gets it right. That’s what we have with e.l.f. Beauty Inc., a hot cosmetics upstart that begins life as a public company Sept. 23. It priced at $17 a share, raising $141.7 million. The Oakland, Calif.-based company sells self-described “high-quality” beauty products, often inspired by hits from prestigious and pricier brands like Sephora. This approach works. Sales at e.l.f (ELF) are growing at a fast clip — 32% a year on average from 2012 to 2015. A key part of the story here is that e.l.f. is a thoroughly modern company in two big ways. 1. It relies heavily on social media for valuable cues on product development and marketing. 2. It borrows a winning concept from apparel known as “fast fashion.” This means the ability to do quick turnarounds on new products to meet the rapidly changing tastes of fickle consumers. Here’s a quick look at the strong points of the first millennial cosmetics company as well as some of the risks. The price is right It’s hard to argue with good prices, as long as the quality is there. And e.l.f. seems to get the mix right, judging by robust sales growth. Most cosmetics go for $6 or less. For example, e.l.f. offers a mineral-infused face primer for $6, compared with $36 for a similar product at upscale competitors like Sephora. Then there’s the Baked Eyeshadow Trio at $4, versus $28. And the e.l.f. Lip Exfoliator at $3 versus $24. Read:Here’s the breakdown of stock IPOs for the remainder of 2016 Everyone likes a bargain. But at these prices, customers can readily experiment and “play beautifully” — which happens to be the company’s motto. “The pricing strategy is brilliant,” says Tom Taulli, author of “High-Profit IPO Strategies: Finding Breakout IPOs for Investors and Traders.” The low prices for high quality are effective marketing “because once customers buy, they keep buying more,” he says. Free help from YouTube “consultants” A lot of companies save on costs by using external employees, but e.l.f. has pushed this concept to the max. And this is a big plus for investors since it boosts profitability. Here’s how this trick works. Like most businesses, e.l.f. engages with consumers on Instagram, Facebook (FB)(TWTR) and Google’s (GOOG) YouTube — where women post videos and reviews about e.l.f. products. But e.l.f. goes a step further. It closely studies the videos and feedback, to cook up the next big hit. Next, it tests new products on its website and studies sales trends and online commentary. Finally, it culls winners for wider distribution through its main sales channels — big retailers like (WMT) Target (TGT) CVS Health (CVS) and Old Navy, a division of the Gap (GPS) E.l.f. has nine stores and a website, but these retailers together handle about 90% of sales. This approach is clever because it keeps the hits rolling. “They have been very good at introducing new products. They are hitting the right trends in the young demographic,” says Kathleen Smith, an IPO expert with Renaissance Capital, which manages IPO-focused exchange traded funds (ETF) like the Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO) This approach also produces huge cost savings. That helps you as an investor. For example, last year e.l.f. spent just 3% of sales ($3.9 million) on marketing, compared with 20% on average at the five biggest cosmetics companies. Obviously, the boost to margins here is good for shareholders. E.l.f. says it views its customers as its “stars,” and you should, too, as an investor. Customers don’t seem to mind chipping in for free, in this way. They view it as part of a valuable “relationship” with the company, says e.l.f. “Our consumers are part of the process, and know that their feedback is valuable and impacts the brand,” the company says in filings. Fast fashion, meet makeup E.l.f was founded in 2004 by the father-and-son team of Alan and Joey Shamah, who worked long enough in retail to know the importance of “fast fashion.” Retailers like H&M, Forever 21, Primark and Zara shook up the apparel business by tightening up supply chains so much, they can quickly roll out new styles to capitalize on a flash trend. Then they move on to the next, leaving more traditional players like J.C. Penney (JCP) and Macy’s (M) in the dust. The father-and-son team decided to apply the same concept to cosmetics. And e.l.f. was born. “They can pump out a product fairly quickly,” says Taulli. “This is a new spin on the traditional manufacturer in cosmetics.” The company can launch a new product in as little as five months, which is pretty fast for retail. Fast fashion means fast growth All of this adds up to hot growth: 32% sales growth last year. And thanks to that army of free YouTube and Instagram consultants who help keep costs down, an ever-growing piece of sales gets converted into profits, as sales expand. For example, a form of cash flow known as EBITDA (or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) grew 64% last year to $46.2 million. As for the bottom line, it flipped to green from red. A loss of $2.9 million turned into a net profit of $4.4 million. There is a lot of blue sky ahead. E.l.f. says its sales represent only 2.3% of the U.S. mass cosmetics market, which was worth $8 billion in sales last year. The company hopes to expand its customer base by developing mass appeal, getting into more stores and commanding more floor space in stores. It also has a nice tailwind. The U.S. cosmetics market overall, worth $14 billion last year, is growing at a rapid clip. It grew 5% a year from 2010 to 2015. E.l.f. also wants to expand into skin care, a market worth $16 billion in annual sales in the U.S. This could benefit investors nicely because margins are higher, says Renaissance Capital’s Smith. The company also has lots of room to expand abroad since it gets only about 7% of sales there now. Risks Yes, there are risks. 1. The big one is that e.l.f. has to keep the growth rate up. And this might be tough in such a competitive industry. Combatants include big players like Estee Lauder (EL) Procter & Gamble (PG) Revlon (REV) and L’Oreal. 2. It’s also a bit troubling that the investment shop that has owned e.l.f. for the past few years, TPG Growth II Management, is selling a big chunk of its stake in the initial public offering. That’s not exactly a vote of confidence. “But at least the CEO is not selling shares on the offering,” says Smith. And TPG will still own a big stake, despite its sale. 3. Another ding here is that the company recently took on debt to pay insiders and TPG a $72 million dividend. It will use a lot of the IPO proceeds to pay down that debt, as opposed to investing in the business. And, finally, there is the Donald Trump factor. A big part of his platform is “bringing jobs back home.” E.l.f. manufactures in China. So if Trump wins and succeeds at getting high tariffs on imported goods, investors might be left shelling out for concealers to cover up their scars.

(AAPL), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC) and Coty Inc (COTY) Options activity provides a bit of insight on AAPL, WFC and COTY stock By Joseph Hargett, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Sep 22, 2016, 8:56 am EST     Popular Posts: Monday’s Vital Data: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Facebook Inc (FB) and Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Thursday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) 2 Post-Trump Trades for Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Earnings Recent Posts: Thursday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Nike Inc (NKE) Stock Can’t Count on a Save From Santa Claus Wednesday’s Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), Chevron Corporation (CVX) and United States Steel Corporation (X) View All Posts U.S. stock futures are headed higher once again this morning, as Wall Street seems relieved that the Federal Reserve didn’t raise interest rates at this week’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting. However, Fed Chair Janet Yellen did indicate that a hike is likely before the end of the year. On the economic front today, weekly jobless claims, the August Chicago Fed national activity index, August existing home sales and August leading indicators are all slated for release later this morning. Against this backdrop, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average have added 0.44%, while S&P 500 futures are up 0.44% and Nasdaq-100 futures have risen 0.5%. Wednesday’s options activity was brisk, as traders reacted to the Fed’s decision to hold pat on interest rates for the time being. Overall, an above-average 17.8 million calls and 17.5 million puts changed hands on the session. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio rose to 0.63, while the 10-day moving average rebounded to 0.65. 9 Dividend Stocks for a Full Calendar of Safe Income Analyst action provided the fuel for Wednesday’s options volume, with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) upgraded again on prospects for iPhone 7 unit sales, while Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) was downgraded amid its latest fraud firestorm. Finally, Coty Inc (NYSE:COTY) options traders continued to pile into COTY after the stock was downgraded. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Apple received yet another upgrade in the wake of positive preorders reports for the iPhone 7. This time UBS lifted its price target on AAPL stock to $127 from $115; the consensus target is $124.91 according to Thomson/First Call. While UBS said it doesn’t see demand for the iPhone 7 coming in better than the iPhone 6, the brokerage cited “encouraging Evidence Lab analysis of search volumes” for the target hike. Additionally, UBS said that Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) isn’t seeing the same preorder demand as its competitors, lending a bit of caution to the research report. Options traders are also expressing a bit of caution on AAPL stock. Yesterday’s volume was strong, with 930,000 contracts changing hands. And while the fact that calls made up 63% of Wednesday’s activity would be a bullish indicator for most other stocks, for AAPL, it’s only par for the course. Emphasizing the point, Apple’s September/October put/call open interest ratio currently rests at 0.90, which is high for AAPL and indicates that puts and calls are in near parity among options set to expire within the next two months. Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) Wells Fargo has really stepped in it this time, with reports of account fraud drawing severe scrutiny from federal regulators and Senate hearings. With pressure mounting on the company, analysts are reevaluating their positions, and J.P. Morgan decided to lower its stance on the banking giant. Citing the rising maelstrom around Wells Fargo, J.P. Morgan cut its price target to $48 from $53.50 — a move that runs counter to upgrades from Morgan Stanley and R.W. Baird in the past two sessions. The weight of the situation is even beginning to drag sentiment in the options pits lower. On Wednesday, WFC saw volume rise to nearly 428,000 contracts, with puts snapping up 58% of the day’s take. Short-term speculators have loaded up on out-of-the-money puts, with more than 12,000 of these bearish contracts accumulating at the $44 strike — a target that WFC could realistically hit before the close on Friday if the situation continues to escalate. Coty Inc. (COTY) Cosmetics company Coty has been a hotbed of speculation this week for options traders. The shares have plunged more than 19% since mid-August, but recently, COTY appears to be putting in a bottom near $24. Support in the $24 region was put to the test on Wednesday after Zacks downgraded the stock to “hold” from “strong buy.” Even Jim Cramer got in on the act, advising followers to sell COTY stock in favor of Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG). Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Is in Tip-Top Shape Options traders appeared slightly hopeful for COTY on Wednesday, however. Total volume came in at nearly 219,000 contracts, with calls snapping up 53% of the day’s take. Looking out to October, call OI for COTY is focused on the $25 strike, where 2,500 contracts currently reside. By comparison, 3,800 puts are open at the October $24 strike for the same series. As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Photo: Bloomberg News By Alexandra Bruell Alexandra Bruell The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyAlexandra Bruell alexandra.bruell@wsj.com Sept. 21, 2016 7:33 p.m. ET 0 COMMENTS Japanese ad holding company Dentsu has notified client Toyota of irregularities in its transactions, according to a statement from the automotive giant. “While we are not in a position to provide additional details, we have been notified by Dentsu of irregularities in some digital media business transactions,” said Toyota in a statement from the company’s global headquarters. Dentsu did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but has been in touch with at least one analyst that covers its business. “While the scale of the matter is unknown, Dentsu investor relations has indicated to us that they do not anticipate any material impact to the company from the situation,” said Brian Wieser, senior analyst at Pivotal Research, in a note Wednesday. After an internal investigation by Toyota, the ad and media company faces questions about digital media transactions going back at least five years, according to the Financial Times. The incident, first reported by Australian publication AdNews, comes amid allegations of non-transparent business practices by media agencies in the U.S., and as the industry grapples with how to handle a breakdown in trust between agencies and clients. Dentsu dominates the ad and media business in Japan, but the holding company derived more than half of its business from markets outside of Japan in fiscal 2015. That was up 15% from 2012, when it agreed to acquire U.K.-based media agency Aegis Group in a $5 billion deal. The company has completed more than 80 acquisitions in the past three years and counts large global advertisers like Toyota, General Motors and Procter & Gamble among its clients. Unlike Dentsu’s operations in the U.S., its Japanese interests encompass both media brands and the agencies that buy commercial space from those media brands.

Survey says millennials to blame WATE Staff Published: September 21, 2016, 8:19 am Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) KNOXVILLE, TN (WATE) – When it comes to how Americans use soap, it’s fair to say millennials are making a clean sweep of it. Bar soap sales are going down the drain. Many Americans are ditching bar soap in favor of its liquid counterpart. According to information from consumer research Mintel, young people between 18 to 24 are largely snubbing the old-fashioned bar of soap, leading to sales declines for the likes of Ivory’s iconic 125-year old bar and its bar soap rivals. The survey shows older folks who still buy bar soap are men 60 years and and older. Between 2014 and 2015, sales of traditional bar soap — which account for roughly 30 percent of soap, bath and shower product sales — slumped by 2.2 percent, says Mintel. That occurred at the same time that soap and shower product sales rose by 2.7 percent. Liquid body soaps accounted for 47 percent of all sales in the soap, bath and shower product category and were valued at $2.7 billion. The preference for liquid soap is largely based on a perceived “ick” factor of using bar soap to wash up. As younger consumers and women snubbed the traditional bar in favor of liquid soap, what’s driving the generational shift? The survey shows that millennials believe bar soaps are covered in germs after they are used. Some health authorities, like Minnesota’s Department of Health, are now recommending a switch to liquid soap noting that germs can grow on bar soap and spread infections. Mintel found that about half, 48 percent, of Americans think bar soap is covered in germs after use. Among millennials, that percentage jumps to 60 percent. Meanwhile, among Americans ages 65 and older, just 31 percent think that bar soap holds germs. Liquid soap has something else going for it: a convenience factor that allows companies to sell new products at a higher price. Companies like Procter & Gamble and Unilever are constantly tweaking their products to develop new ones to appeal to young consumers. It may be no surprise that liquid soaps, and in-shower moisturizers, have a much higher price tag than the traditional bar of soap.

School levy: What if it fails? Hannah Sparling , hsparling@enquirer.com 11:56 a.m. EDT September 21, 2016 . (Photo: Hannah Sparling) There’s a 7.93-mill levy on the ballot this November to support Cincinnati Public Schools and Cincinnati Preschool Promise, and there are some things voters want to know before they check yes or no. You sent us your questions about the levy; here are the answers. We’ll respond to a new question every week. Want to know something else? Email hsparling@enquirer.com. Question three: What happens if the levy fails? Every levy carries a promise: Vote for this, and we’ll do this. On the flip side, there’s an implied threat. No levy? Well, then this will happen. The school levy this November is a joint venture, so there are two sides to the what-if of failure. Side one: Cincinnati Public Schools CPS will get an extra $33 million a year from the levy, plus whatever it uses of the $15 million slated for preschool expansion. If the levy fails, the school district will start looking at what programs to delay or scale back, said Superintendent Mary Ronan, during a meeting with The Enquirer’s editorial board. CPS took a hard look at its finances before settling on the levy amount, Ronan said, and the 7.93-mill ask is still not quite enough. The school district is relying on its own forecasts plus an additional financial efficiency review. The last new-money levy the district passed was in 2008. “We needed a bit more,” Ronan said, pointing to the review that shows looming deficits in the $30 million a year range, “but we knew we couldn’t ask. So, we’ll have to cut back.” Ronan couldn’t say what program(s) would be first on the block if the levy goes down – budget talks start in January, she said – but the effects would be wide-ranging. Even if cuts start centrally, which is likely, they will ripple. “It will impact all of our school and all of the departments,” she said. Side two: Cincinnati Preschool Promise Over the next five years, Preschool Promise and CPS expect to serve 6,000 preschool students through the levy. Some of those will get tuition credits. Some will attend a preschool making improvements with funding from the levy. That could mean better teachers, for example, or better curriculum. If it fails, that won’t happen. The threat of failure is the status quo. Levy supporters, of course, don't like to discuss the possibility of failure. They are pitching the Nov. 8 vote as a question of morality – a "vote against poverty." "This is our game to win," said John Pepper, former Procter & Gamble CEO and a levy backer. "If we don't succeed on this, shame on us." Question one: How much money goes to overhead? Question two: Will religious preschools get money?

Rochester, NY, September 21, 2016 --(PR.com)-- Printing Impressions magazine announced that Diamond Packaging won three awards in the 29th annual Gold Ink Awards competition, the industry's most prestigious print competition. Winners were chosen from nearly 1,000 entries submitted within 50 different categories. Entries were judged on print quality, technical difficulty, and overall visual effect. Diamond won a Pewter Award in the “Calendars” category, for its 2016 calendar, which marks the 25th anniversary of a long-standing company tradition. The grandfather clock theme, with its inner mechanisms perfectly balanced, represents the collaborative and precise nature of Diamond’s work. The calendar was converted utilizing Clearwater Paper Candesce® SBS paperboard and offset printed with four color process inks, UV matte coating, and UV gloss spot coating. The dimensional header features a multi-level embossed and debossed woodgrain pattern, and a striking clock face insert enhanced with UV gloss spot coating, cold foil, and multi-level embossing, creating a dramatic sense of texture and depth. It also incorporates an opening APET rigid window panel and foil embossed chimes that artfully simulate a real grandfather clock. The middle backers also feature a multi-level embossed woodgrain pattern, and three unique sets of foil embossed gears enhanced with UV gloss spot coating. Metal Magic provided all of the embossing dies. The tightly-registered foil accents, which lend authenticity to the piece, were achieved using state-of-the-art, in-line cold foiling technology. They also showcase the type of decorative effects that can cost-effectively elevate customers’ brands. Diamond won a Pewter Award in the “Folding Cartons” category for Elizabeth Arden’s 5th Avenue Only NYC carton. The carton was converted utilizing metallized polyester board and printed with UV flexo fuchsia purple, dense black, and opaque white offset inks, in-line with DiamondTouch soft touch coating, UV matte, and UV gloss spot coating. High gloss embossed accents on the front panel provide a stunning contrast to the interlaced matte and spot UV gloss pattern surrounding it. The combination of color and textures reinforces 5th Avenue as a prestige brand, and beautifully complements the primary container – a glass bottle with tall clean lines, purple color palette, and gold infused cap. Diamond won a Pewter Award in the “Folding Cartons” category for L’Oreal USA’s Matrix Oil Wonders promotional packaging. The carton was converted utilizing KapStone Kraftpak® high-yield, low density paperboard and printed with UV flexo white, opaque white, four color process, and dense black inks, in-line with UV varnish. Printed opaque white dots provide a perfect counterpoint to the brilliant gold foil stamped dots, creating dimension and visual interest. Gold foil surrounds the die cut windows, framing the hair care products within and drawing attention to the free product sample inside. The interplay between the unbleached paperboard and foil accents create shimmering metallic effects that are very unusual for a kraft-type folding carton. All of Diamond’s winning entries were manufactured using 100% clean, renewable wind energy and produced in a Zero Manufacturing Waste to Landfill (ZMWL) facility.
