Facebook will, however, continue to deliver ad content to its users as it bypasses ad blockers on desktop.  ( Carl Court | Getty Images ) Advertisement For a well-known company such as Procter & Gamble, the world's biggest ad spender, going for Facebook's targeted ads just might not be the most effective advertising strategy. P&G will veer away from niche marketing on the social media platform after realizing it "went too narrow" but didn't prove as effective as the company had hoped. "Now we're looking at: What is the best way to get the most reach but also the right precision?" Marc Pritchard, chief marketing officer of P&G, tells the Wall Street Journal. Bigger Brands, Broader Reach The biggest selling point of Facebook marketing is, of course, the company's ability to drill down into unique user demographics and psychographics, and serve advertisers the exact commodity audience it is looking for, whether the subjects be working moms on the East Coast, animé enthusiasts in Brazil or chocolate lovers in Osaka. Cornering a niche market might work for a local brand targeting a specific community. But, for a well-established name like P&G, the right strategy might still be in casting the net far and wide and going for more traditional advertising platforms such as television. "The bigger your brand," says Brian Weiser, an analyst for Pivotal Research, "the more you need broad reach and less targeted media." To be clear, P&G will not altogether slash its budget for Facebook ads in general, but it will make use of targeting only where it seems logical to, the WSJ reports. The company recognizes that its recent ad strategy just "targeted too much" of the niche markets, but connecting with audiences on digital platforms will remain an integral part of the company's marketing plans. Back To TV Commercials P&G also aims to boost its advertising budget by 5 percent, after shelling out about $7.2 billion last year, but beginning in late 2015, it has reportedly redirected much of its budget to TV commercials. One Facebook spokeswoman points out that the social media platform enjoys growth from its partnership with P&G each year and that "the cornerstone of [Facebook's] ad strategy is a mix of mass reach and personalized targeting." This unique approach, Facebook believes, provides a "strong complement to TV" in a mobile-first age. Facebook Bypasses Ad Blockers The social media site is also constantly looking for ways to deliver ad content to its massive base of 1.7 billion users. Just this week, for instance, the company tweaked its technology to bypass ad blockers on desktop. Even as P&G pulls back on targeting, Facebook's revenue from advertising as a whole continues to grow significantly, increasing by almost 50 percent, to pull in more than $17 billion last year. With a user base of more than one billion and counting, all other advertisers may be scrambling to get a slice of that market.

How many times have girls quit sports around us without receiving the encouragement to continue? With nearly 7 out of 10 girls feeling they do not belong in sports, it's no wonder half of girls quit sports by the end of puberty. Always is partnering with UN Women and IOC globally to change that, because sports keep girls confident. "Earlier this summer, Always® embarked on a new chapter in its mission to stop the drop in confidence girls experience at puberty by encouraging all girls to stay in sports and Keep Playing #LikeAGirl. Sports are such an important confidence-builder, yet too many girls lack the encouragement, resources and even access that will keep them playing," said Michele Baeten, Always Associate Director, Procter & Gamble. "We're so excited to create meaningful partnerships that make a real difference to keep more girls in sports, and drive awareness on the important role that sports play in building girls' confidence." Partnership efforts kicked off on Saturday in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil where Always committed its support to the UN Women & International Olympic Committee (IOC) initiative "One Win Leads to Another," that will help 2,500 local Brazilian girls, aged 10-18 years, gain access to sports and confidence-building curriculum as part of a six-month pilot program. These three organizations are coming together to achieve their shared goal to invest in girls' skills and training to support a generation of stronger, more confident and empowered women. The curriculum leveraged in this program, developed by UN Women's partner Women Win and adapted for the Olympic legacy programme in Brazil, has proven to drastically improve girls' confidence and understanding of sexual health and rights, finances and economic empowerment: 89% of girls say they are a leader, compared to 46% before the programme; 68% of girls have increased knowledge and understanding of gender-based violence and 93% of them know where to report violence; Nearly 80% of girls have an increased understanding of their sexual and reproductive health and rights; and know how to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. This announcement is part of the Always brand's commitment to encourage girls to stay in sport and Keep Playing #LikeAGirl. All over the world we are partnering with local organizations, coaches and teachers and providing them with simple, ready to use communication tools and information to encourage girls to Keep Playing #LikeAGirl. In Canada, Always is proud to announce a national partnership with the Canadian Women's Foundation. This partnership will help to stop the drop in girls' confidence by supporting programs in communities across Canada for girls, aged nine to 13 that engage their bodies, minds, and spirits. These programs encourage girls to participate in sports and physical activity, explore science and technology, develop critical thinking skills and take on leadership in a supportive all-girl environment. Among girls who have participated in Canadian Women's Foundation-funded programs over the past three years, 92% reported feeling more confident, 96% reported feeling better about being a girl, and 88% reported having new strengths or skills. "Girls are routinely exposed to stereotypes that erode their confidence and embed self-limiting beliefs," says Beth Malcolm, Director of the Girls' Fund at the Canadian Women's Foundation. "The Always #LikeAGirl campaign is a natural fit with our work, and this partnership is a deep acknowledgement of the powerful role that sports and physical activity can play in stopping the drop in girls' confidence. Always' support will help us to continue this important work of empowering girls to defy stereotypes." Many studies have found that ongoing participation in sports and physical activity is a high contributor to confidence in girls, and provides valuable skills to help them stay confident to do any and every thing later in life. In fact, a recent consumer study showed that women ages 18 to 24 are twice as likely to be confident if they play sports regularly, compared to those who do not play at all. Additionally, the recent Always Confidence & Puberty Survey found that girls reported that three of the top benefits of staying in sports are increased confidence, teamwork, and leadership skills. About Always #LikeAGirl The Always #LikeAGirl movement is being fueled by the millions of girls around the world who are changing #LikeAGirl to mean amazing things. The Always #LikeAGirl campaign launched in June 2014 was inspired by the insight that the start of puberty and the first period mark the lowest moment in confidence for girls and how harmful words can add to that drop in confidence. It demonstrated the profound effect the phrase "like a girl" can have on girls' self-confidence and it inspired a movement, which has started to change public perception: after seeing the #LikeAGirl video, most people (76 percent of women ages 16 to 24 and 59 percent of men) said the video changed their perception of the phrase "like a girl,"*** according to the Always Puberty & Confidence Wave II Study. But it could not stop there. In 2015, a new Always study revealed that 72 percent of girls feel society limits them by telling them what they should and should not do or be. And more than half of girls felt that societal limitations would be the same or worse ten years from now, showing a lack of hope for change. Always could not accept that and launched the Unstoppable #LikeAGirl campaign to empower all girls to show the world that they could do or be anything and everything. In March 2016, the brand tackled the subtle bias conveyed through emojis, and the resulting conversation can be credited in part for a proposal to UNICODE Consortium that has yielded more female options. In June 2016, the brand released new survey data which finds that half of girls quit sports by age 17 and that seven in ten girls do not feel encouraged to play, despite data that links sports participation to increased confidence. To help keep girls in sports, Always launched the new Always #LikeAGirl - Keep Playing initiative, now in progress. For more information about the #LikeAGirl movement, visit www.always.com.

Facebook Inc. has spent years developing its ability to zero in on consumers based on demographics, shopping habits and life milestones. P&G, the maker of myriad household goods including Tide and Pampers, initially jumped at the opportunity to market directly to subsets of shoppers, from teenage shavers to first-time homeowners. Marc Pritchard, P&G’s chief marketing officer, said the company has realized it took the strategy too far. “We targeted too much, and we went too narrow,” he said in an interview, “and now we’re looking at: What is the best way to get the most reach but also the right precision?” Mr. Pritchard said P&G won’t cut back on Facebook spending and will employ targeted ads where it makes sense, such as pitching diapers to expectant mothers. He said P&G has ramped up spending both on digital sites and traditional platforms. One category the company is scaling back: smaller websites that lack the reach of sites such as Facebook, Google and YouTube. On a broader scale, P&G’s shift highlights the limits of such targeting for big brands, one of the cornerstones of Facebook’s ad business. The social network is able to command higher prices for its targeted marketing; the narrower the targeting the more expensive the ad. Related Coverage Retailers Dominate List of Popular Holiday Ads Nov. 23, 2016 Forbes Takes a Page From Snapchat Nov. 22, 2016 BuzzFeed, NBCUniversal to Intertwine Ad Sales and Production Nov. 22, 2016 Mobile Ad Targeting Is Improving, According to Nielsen Nov. 22, 2016 P&G could be the bellwether on how consumer goods companies and big brands use digital advertising. Over the past year some marketers, specifically consumer product companies, have discovered they need to go “much more broad” with their advertising on social media sites such as Facebook, said James Douglas, executive director of social-media agency Society, which is owned by Interpublic Group. Mr. Douglas said case studies show that companies can receive a bigger sales increase if they reach a more significant portion of a platform’s overall audience. For instance, P&G two years ago tried targeting ads for its Febreze air freshener at pet owners and households with large families. The brand found that sales stagnated during the effort, but they rose when the campaign on Facebook and elsewhere was expanded last March to include anyone over 18. A Facebook spokeswoman said its partnership with P&G “grows every year” and the two companies learn from one another. “That has always been the spirit of how we work together and challenge one another,” she said. Facebook started working on a targeted ad system in 2007, when it was an unprofitable three-year-old startup with less than 60 million active users. At the time, its main marketing platform was free Facebook pages through which companies promoted their products. ENLARGE Facebook has since emerged as a marketing platform of singular scale. Last year, Facebook raked in $17.08 billion in ad revenue, up 49% year over year, as advertisers sought the attention of its 1.7 billion monthly active users. Advertisers can pinpoint their target audience precisely. Political candidates can focus on users in congressional districts, restaurant chains can run campaigns to spicy food lovers, and moving companies can find users who are “very likely” to move to another home. “If you could run an ad and reach a million people or run a targeted ad to reach 5,000, you have to have pretty impressive returns on that 5,000 to make it worth it,” said Peter Daboll, chief executive of Ace Metrix, which tests ads for effectiveness and works with Facebook. Cincinnati-based P&G spent roughly $7.2 billion on advertising globally in the year that ended in June, up about 1% from the previous year, according to company filings. P&G said it plans to increase it around 5% for the year that started July 1. Prior to last year’s increase, the company cut spending two years in a row. P&G’s push to find broader reach with its advertising is also evident in the company’s recent increases in television spending. Toward the end of last year P&G began shifting money back into television, according to people familiar with the matter. During the first quarter of 2016, the company’s ad spending jumped 11% to $429 million from the year earlier, Kantar Media said. For many of the largest advertisers in the world, the precise targeting tools touted by Facebook are less of a draw, said Pivotal Research analyst Brian Weiser. “The bigger your brand, the more you need broad reach and less targeted media,” he said. Targeting is paramount for advertisers trying to get users to download a game app or a small business trying to appeal to local customers. Facebook has started offering new tools specifically for large advertisers, including a way to boost brand awareness by showing ads to people who are more likely to pay attention to them. On Tuesday, it introduced changes that make it harder for people to block ads from appearing on its desktop website. “The cornerstone of our ad strategy is a mix of mass reach and personalized targeting that lends well to mobile consumption and is a strong complement to TV,” the Facebook spokeswoman said. Not all big advertisers are pulling back on Facebook’s targeted marketing. Priceline Group Inc. said it expects lower returns in the current quarter from bookings generated from its advertising, much of which goes through Alphabet Inc.’s Google. As a result the travel company plans to increase spending on Facebook’s targeted ads. “We found that a number of things we’ve done on Facebook works well,” Chief Executive Jeffery Boyd said. “We would like to spend more money on Facebook going forward.” Corrections & Amplifications: The correct name of the CEO of Priceline Group Inc. is Jeffery Boyd. An earlier version of this article misstated his name. (Aug. 17) — Suzanne Vranica contributed to this article.

That’s what makes it so fresh,” McGrath said during an interview, during which she unveiled Pat McGrath Labs’ Lust 004, her foray into lips. “It’s [about] a bare face, a modern, bare face with mascara and brow control and a touch of Skin Fetish [McGrath’s highlighter that came out in April] and a divine jeweled lip.” She showed how her lip sets, composed of five products that could be mixed, matched and layered to achieve varying finishes, colors and intensities, bring editorial and runway beauty trends to the consumer. Each kit — available in Version Flesh (nude), Version Vermillion Venom (red) or Version Bloodwine (purple and deep red) — comes with two matte lipsticks; a clear, high-shine lip gloss; saturated gold pigment, and a glitter pot. McGrath said she only creates things she is obsessed with and right now it’s glitter. Lust 004 was born from the glitter lips she conceptualized for Atelier Versace’s couture show in July. Cue the social media frenzy: Kylie Cosmetics adds eye shadows Rachel Brown Kylie Jenner’s march to beauty moguldom is taking another stride today with the release of an eye shadow palette from her namesake brand.

Kylie Jenner’s march to beauty moguldom is taking another stride today with the release of an eye shadow palette from her namesake brand. The nine-shade bronze Kyshadow palette is one of three palettes Kylie Cosmetics is scheduled to launch this year. Jenner revealed news of the $42 palette on... (Rachel Brown) She explained the inspiration and how to apply the new range, and for most, it might seem unlikely that her vision will be able to make it from runway to the lips of regular people. But it’s more versatile than one would think. As demonstrated by a group of three models, who each wore a different colored lip and the corresponding finely ground glitter, the look, while definitely a statement, is not reminiscent of a child’s arts and crafts project. “Glitter is for every day, in my mind,” she mused. “You want it in the daylight, you want it in the sun.” Customers can wear the matte lipstick solo, paint on the corresponding glitter or layer the clear gloss on top of both for optimal shine. A saturated gold pigment could be mixed with the gloss to impart a metallic sheen (to be worn solo on a bare lip, with the matte lipstick to create a high-gloss finish or as a finale step over the glitter) or painted delicately on one’s cupid bow as a lip liner/highlighter hybrid.

Each makeup artist’s releases is a singular launch — Lust 004 will be McGrath’s fourth — and it’s very deliberate. Only 25,000 units of Skin Fetish 003 were produced, with the same quantity made for Lust 004, which hits patmcgrath.com at noon Eastern Standard Time on Aug. 30. McGrath, who is releasing her second product in less than four months, is carefully building a business predicated on a new “cult beauty product model” that is fueled by social media. Similar to Kylie Jenner, McGrath manufactures a product in limited quantities and introduces it to the public via Instagram, where her account @patmcgrathreal has 881,000 followers. She invites her fans to shop it at her e-commerce site. Unlike Jenner, though, McGrath has partnered with Sephora, which will introduce Lust 004 on Sept. 8 in 10 select doors and on sephora.com — while supplies last, of course.

 P&G, the world's biggest ad spender, is cutting back on targeted Facebook ads because they weren't effective Nathan McAlone Aug. 9, 2016, 1:08 PM 51,720 facebook linkedin twitter email print Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Procter & Gamble, the largest ad spender in the world, is cutting down on its targeted Facebook ads, according to The Wall Street Journal. The reason: The company decided the ads weren't effective. Facebook stock fell immediately following the news but is trading at about even for the day. "We targeted too much and we went too narrow," Marc Pritchard, P&G's chief marketing officer, told The Journal. "And now we're looking at: What is the best way to get the most reach but also the right precision?" One example cited by The Journal explains P&G's position well. Two years ago the company tried targeting Facebook ads for its Febreze air freshener at "pet owners and households with large families." Sales for Febreze "stagnated" during the campaign but went up when P&G opened it up to everyone over 18 years old. This doesn't mean P&G will cut back on Facebook spending generally, however, and it will still use targeted ads at points. But the implications about the effectiveness of targeted ads for big brands might trouble Facebook, which snagged $17.08 billion in ad revenue last year. Facebook's ability to precisely target ads based on its large swaths of user data has been its main differentiator for almost a decade. Facebook provided the following comment to Business Insider: "Our partnership with P&G grows every year in service of effective and efficient advertising. We learn from each other and iterate. That has always been the spirit of how we work together and challenge one another. The cornerstone of our ad strategy is a mix of mass reach and personalized targeting that lends well to mobile consumption and is a strong complement to TV. Our clients tell us this strategy works because we can deliver relevant marketing to the right audiences, with unprecedented scale. It enables partners like P&G to drive the business metrics they care about. "We see targeting success across the CPG category — for example, campaigns reaching audiences like 'households with dishwashers' or 'non-chocolate candy buyers' that drive awareness and sales. We believe that when brands are focused on the right metrics — ROI versus proxies like cost, we can most effectively help businesses grow."

THE HINDU PHOTOARCHIVES / PIB Paradigm shift India’s economy, which was once characterised by Nehruvian socialism, stands vastly ‘Modified’ today. THE HINDU PHOTOARCHIVES / PIB There is much to be proud of about the evolution of the economy. But it’s time for policymakers to up their game Former Proctor & Gamble India CEO Gurcharan Das is fond of narrating an anecdote that encapsulates the entrepreneurial experience in the India of the ‘licence raj’ era. One bleak winter in the early 1980s, when a flu wave was sweeping across parts of India, Richardson Hindustan (as P&G was then known) ended up selling truckloads of Vicks Vaporub, the cream that provides relief from cold and cough. But rather than serve as cause for celebration, it only induced anxiety in Das. That’s because the company had overshot its government-approved manufacturing capacity, which was considered a cardinal sin in the heavily controlled industrial ecosystem under then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. “My company secretary told me that I could be prosecuted for exceeding the production capacity,” recalls Das. “I lived with that fear — whereas anywhere else, I’d have been rewarded!” Das’ account symbolises the frustrations of entrepreneurs who sought to navigate India’s closed economy during the post-Independence phase, right up until the big-bang reforms of 1991. Even today, vestiges of that restrictive era remain in pockets of the economy, but today – as India stands on the threshold of its 70th Independence Day — it is possible to look back and celebrate, with some caveats, the incredible journey that the country has been on. Changed landscape The economic landscape today is vastly different from 1947 (see Graphic: India in Numbers). What was once predominantly an agrarian economy (agriculture and allied activities accounted for 52 per cent of the GDP in 1951-52; today, that’s down to 15 per cent) has morphed into a semi-industrial and services economy that is today the world’s seventh-largest, with GDP in excess of $2 trillion. Along the way, it has weathered political and economic turmoil on an epic scale, muddled through two decades of Nehruvian, Soviet-style statism, opportunistic invocations of ‘socialism’ during the Indira Gandhi years, and the first tentative efforts at opening up under Rajiv Gandhi, which however only accentuated the infirmities in the economy and culminated in July 1991, when the country came perilously close to the ignominious prospect of defaulting on its external balance of payment obligations. That crisis set the stage for sweeping economic reforms, which have, without risk of exaggeration, dramatically transformed the economic landscape and the business ecosystem and unleashed tremendous entrepreneurial energies, causing old-world industrial empires to reinvent themselves – or fall by the wayside. The momentous nature of what happened in 1991, under the stewardship of then Finance Minister Manmohan Singh, is universally acknowledged. Gurcharan Das puts it bluntly when he says: “If not for the reforms, we would have remained a Third World basket case.” Legitimate pride As RBI Governor at the time of the post-1991 reform process, C Rangarajan, currently Chairman of the Madras School of Economics, played a pivotal role in steering monetary policy. With that experience, together with his experience of having served in various capacities in successive governments, he sums up India’s economic journey over these 70 years thus: “From where we started (at the time of Independence), we have come a long way. And even in terms of growth, one can legitimately be proud of our achievements” (see Interview). In his view, however, India’s standing would have been vastly better today if it had embarked on the reform process in the 1970s, when it first became clear that the state-led model had not quite yielded the kind of growth that had been targeted. “We would have gained another decade and a half at least in terms of higher growth. And given the social orientation of our policymakers, that would have allowed them to move faster to reduce the drawbacks on the social side,” Rangarajan adds. Stark failures India’s failures on the social front are stark: despite decades of “poverty alleviation measures”, it will continue to account for the largest share of the world’s poor for a considerable period, even if it keeps up its rapid economic growth. And its ranking on the global Human Development Index makes a mockery of its claim to being the world’s fastest-growing major economy. But the consensus among economists is that equity is best served by growth. That certainty has often eluded policymakers, with disastrous consequences for both growth and equity. Today, with the Narendra Modi-led government projecting itself as keen to enhance incentives for the private sector, a sense of cautious optimism permeates. “This is the first time in Indian history that the government is at least trying to remove roadblocks for entrepreneurs,” says Das, with perhaps a touch of hyperbole. The past 70 years have not been insubstantial, and there is a widely shared sense that India’s best years are ahead of it. It will, however, need more than good intentions and momentary feel-good sentiments if India is to perform up to its potential.

While toothpaste is not the first thing that comes to mind when parents think of back-to-school products, this campaign demonstrates how caring for one's teeth can be linked to academic performance. The new Crest ad involves a man dressed as Shakespeare sitting at a desk discussing a student that is missing a lively classroom discussion about Hamlet due to tooth pain. The Shakespeare-look-a-like then spouts a series of hashtags that extol the importance of oral care in helping students achieve academic success. As the ad plainly states at the end: "Kids with poor oral health are 3x more likely to miss school." The ad clearly demonstrates how brands that are not traditionally associated with the back-to-school season can remind families about the important role such products play in the life of a student. #1 IN TREND REPORTS Find Better Ideas Faster™ with our unrivalled research, fueled by 100,000,000 people ➤ Related Top 10 Slideshows Video Pro Services Innovation Accelerator Innovation Keynotes Trend Reports Custom Dashboards Future Festival Free Resources Innovation Videos & Books Weekly Trend Report NEW: 2017 Trend Report Get a FREE Report Back-to-School Computer LineupsNew HP Systems were Announced Early to Help Parents and Students Comedian-Branded Tech AdsBest Buy and Adam Devine Are Showing Consumers 'How to College' Child-Written Promotional CampaignsTarget's Back-to-School Ads were Written and Directed by Kids Emotional Kid-Oriented AdsKleenex's 'Someone Needs One' Campaign Aims to Relieve Kids' Fears Top 80 Commercial Trends in SeptemberFrom Comedic Air Safety Ads to Reality Show Cereal Campaigns Top 60 Kids' Ideas in SeptemberFrom Candy-Themed Coding Games to Allergy-Friendly Seed Spreads Stats for Shakespearean Toothpaste Commercials Trending: This Quarter & Buzzing Research: 102 clicks in 15 w Interest: > 3 minutes Concept: Benefits Of Oral Care Related: 91 examples / 70 photos Segment: Neutral, 4-18 Comparison Set: 33 similar articles, including: sentimental school ads, back-to-school fashion ads, and comical spelling commercials.

Emsley joins Tongal from Saatchi & Saatchi, where he most recently served as both global CEO on the P&G business and strategic advisor to global chairman Kevin Roberts, who announced his resignation last week following a Business Insider interview in which he made controversial comments about gender diversity. “Brands today need a new kind of partner to develop creative that is authentic, targeted and efficiently produced for every platform, from TV commercials to social and original content. Vaughan, a top agency and marketing expert, has identified Tongal as the creative model for the future, and we’re thrilled to welcome him to the leadership team,” Tongal co-founder and CEO Rob Salvatore said in a statement. A longtime veteran of Saatchi & Saatchi, Emsley originally joined the agency as regional account director for Pampers Europe and the Middle East in 1991 and later became regional director for P&G in the Asia/Pacific region. In 2000, he was named global equity director for Iams and Eukanuba, and became global brand agency leader for Pampers two years after that. After three years in that role, he was named executive vice president and head of the global P&G account, spending eight years in that role before being named global head of planning and transformation in October of 2013. “Tongal is the new model for creating content, and is a major challenge to the existing agency model, which isn’t giving brands what they need to communicate with today’s audiences across a growing range of media environments.” said Emsley. “Combining Tongal’s huge creative network with sharp strategic direction and true human insight provides a winning alternative for marketers looking for relevance and success. Before joining Tongal, I conferred with many client-side marketers, and everyone’s advice was the same – they said, ‘Do it, this is what we need.'” *For God’s sake, do not call it “Like Uber, but for advertising.” < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Photo: AFP mail print View all comments Tweet By Lucy Kellaway - - Published: 4:00 AM, August 9, 2016 Updated: 8:29 AM, August 10, 2016 Last week, I stumbled upon an article by the chief executive of Boston Consulting Group telling twentysomethings how to “accelerate” their careers. Mr Rich Lesser has based his advice on his own splendid, if safe, one — a few years at Procter & Gamble followed by an MBA from Harvard, and then 28 years at BCG. Along the way, he has spoken to thousands of young people and felt moved to tell them where they were going wrong — and how they could become more like him. The piece was on LinkedIn months ago, but BCG is so taken by Mr Lesser’s insights that it is still trumpeting them on social media. However, when I read the article through to its conclusion — “with self-reflection, focus, and a commitment to investing in yourself and making a difference, you can find the place that is right for you” — boredom gave way to alarm. This was very bad advice indeed, and I needed to protect twentysomethings from trying to follow it. His first tip is to choose “something you find truly energising and satisfying”. This sounds okay, but there are three things wrong with it. It is vapid — no one would recommend a job that was enervating and frustrating. Second, it is unhelpful, as when you are in your twenties, it is hard to know if you are going to find a job satisfying until you have tried it. Third, it sets expectations far too high. Even the best jobs are only intermittently energising or satisfying. For a lot of the time, they are boring or frustrating, or both. The gap between expectation and reality is the biggest problem for millennials, and Mr Lesser ought not to widen it. Next, he suggests going for an employer where you will learn things. “Your twenties are a unique period to build a set of capabilities that will last a lifetime.” No, they are not. No set of capabilities, as he puts it, lasts more than a decade or two apart, possibly, from the ability to form a sentence, add up and get on with people. Skills and experience get out of date. His next criterion — Can I make a difference? — is more problematic still. Not only is this the wrong thing for 20-year-olds to ask, as no one makes a difference when starting out, it is wrong for people of any age. I am not sure why we have become so hooked on difference-making per se. Surely it all depends what the difference is. The palliative care nurse at the Whittington hospital who nursed my father in the last days of his life made a difference I will never forget. Equally, British retail tycoon Philip Green made a difference that the 20,000 pensioners at BHS will not forget in a hurry, either. For most wage slaves, it is hard to say what difference we make, but that does not render our jobs pointless. Do management consultants make a difference? Do I? It all depends on your starting point. I imagine today I will make a minor difference to Mr Lesser — though perhaps not a positive one. His final question is the worst of all — Can I find balance? The answer to this is no, as there is no such thing as balance. Instead, all workers have a choice: Working all the time, or not working all the time. It would be better if the CEO of one of the grandest management consultancies in the world told 20-year-olds that he ran a sweatshop for the elite and that working there would mean having to cancel all dates, all birthday parties and all fun outings at a moment’s notice. Like Mr Lesser, I have had a safe, unimaginative sort of career involving just two employers: JPMorgan and the Financial Times. But since my day, and since Mr Lesser’s, two big things have changed. For us, the corporate life was more or less compulsory if you were interested in business; now it is optional as there are start-ups instead. Some people are suited to life in big corporations, others less so. It is hard to know until you try it, so my advice is to take a corporate job early on to find out how much you (dis)like it. The second change is that working life is now so long, there is no hurry to get it right the first time — which leads to my second point. If you take a few bad turns, it does not matter. In deciding to go for P&G and then BCG, Mr Lesser drew up spreadsheets — only, in the end, to go with his heart. I did no such thing. I went for JPMorgan and later for the FT because they were the only companies offering me a job. It seemed a great reason to pick them then. It is still a great reason today.

P&G spends $36M on West Chester property Bowdeya Tweh , btweh@enquirer.com 11:32 a.m. EDT August 8, 2016 Procter & Gamble logo (Photo: Provided/P&G) After two purchases in early July, Procter & Gamble went from landlord to owner of its research and development facilities in West Chester Township. The Downtown Cincinnati-based consumer products giant spent $36.2 million to buy land and buildings at 8256 Union Centre Blvd. and 8611 Beckett Road. The property is home to P&G's Beckett Ridge Technical Center, which sits on more than 50 acres of land. Distribution Funding II, an entity owned by industrial real estate developer and property manager Prologis, sold the property to P&G. ​The purchases are among the largest in Butler County this year. The 25.7-acre Union Centre property cost more than $21 million and the 24.5-acre Beckett Road property cost nearly $15.2 million. The buildings on the campus feature more than 606,000 square feet of space and were built more than 17 years ago, according to the Butler County auditor's office.  Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2b8zyCg TOP VIDEOS Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 22 17:46 Joe Deters asks for retrial of Ray Tensing, seeks change of venue 3:07 Black Friday secrets the stores don't want you to know 1:01 Finding home: A 12-year-old boy's search in the midst of war 6:41 Bills-Bengals postgame wrap 3:10 Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 Use-of-force expert: 'The actions of Ray Tensing were justified' 0:50 Which stores are opening, closing Thanksgiving Day 0:34 \u0022I can't wait to see Tensing on the stand\u0022 0:55 Cincinnati Police Criminalist: Tensing 'seemed nervous or afraid' 2:59

Most Popular Getty Author Created with Sketch. By Ross Benes Aug 9, 2016 Sure, it's pretty fun to engage in casual Cold War rhetoric whenever an All-American athlete crushes a Russian competitor. But it's arguably just as interesting to observe Olympians getting creative with their Zika prevention, doping fiascoes, and athletes being guided toward substandard living quarters. Over the past few weeks, Adweek's Christine Birkner has reported on another interesting Olympics topic that goes beyond the events themselves—corporate advertising and intellectual property. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Birkner reports that only official Olympic sponsors can use words such as "Olympic" or terms such as "Rio 2016" on their social media accounts. Non-official sponsors are also banned from posting Olympics results, wishing Olympians luck, or hosting Olympic-themed events for their employees. As restrictive as those rules seem, they used to be even worse. According to Adweek: In past Olympics, under the IOC's Rule 40, official sponsors like McDonald's, Procter & Gamble and Visa had a lock on advertising during the games. Athletes were barred from tweeting about non-official sponsors, and non-sponsors were not allowed to feature Olympic athletes that they had sponsorship deals with in ads. In February 2015, the IOC announced changes to the rule, which were adopted by the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) in June 2015. Those changes allow athletes to appear in generic advertising that does not explicitly mention the games or use any Olympic intellectual property (the Olympic rings, and terms such as "Olympics" "2016" "Rio," "games" and "gold" are off limits). Athletes also are now allowed to tweet about non-official sponsors provided they don't use such Olympic IP. More From Olympics 2016 20 articles No Zika Cases Were Detected From the Olympics Team Great Britain Had a Massive Luggage Fail These Were the Most Popular Rio Athletes on Tinder Nike Wants You to Know That It Won the Olympics Colbert Will Make an Honest Man Out of Ryan Lochte With the rules loosened, a non-official sponsor such as Under Armour can now promote an ad featuring an Olympian such as Michael Phelps. Previously, an ad like this would not have been allowed. But notice how the ad doesn't feature any Olympic references or logos. Birkner reports that companies are using various creative tactics to get around the intellectual property regulations. These tactics include alternative hashtags, patriotic Snapchat lenses, and using animals and animated fruit in place of humans when depicting athletic events in ads. Sponsorships are a huge part of the Olympics, so it makes sense that the USOC wants to control the advertising around the games. The restrictions may seem overreaching, but then again, when it comes to the intersection of social/digital media and intellectual property rights, society has just been making up shit as it goes. What's interesting about these rules is how they imperceptibly handicap many businesses from shameless branding.

(Photo by Jacob Wheeler)The Center for Michigan | Bridge Magazine  By Jacob Wheeler | Bridge Magazine Sometime early next year, Billie Livingston will close the doors for the last time to her eclectic clothing store, Billies Women's Fashions in downtown Cheboygan. The 125-year-old building at the corner of Main and Division has hosted businesses longer than any other venue in this once booming logging and industrial town near the top of Michigan's mitten. The shop, which is 28 years old, will be one of nearly 20 vacant storefronts on a three-block stretch of downtown. "I'm very pro-Cheboygan, and I don't want any more empty storefronts," said Livingston, who plans to retire. "But things are not getting better. "The average income in Cheboygan is $22,000. The locals can't afford to shop here, even though my prices are fair. They go shop at the Salvation Army." For nearly three decades Billie Livingston has watched Cheboygan empty, sometimes slowly and sometimes in bursts. When the Procter & Gamble plant downtown closed in 1990, it eliminated hundreds of jobs. WalMart's arrival two years later lent hope to some, but when it doubled in size and added a superstore in 2002, retailers downtown couldn't compete and went out of business. Cheboygan Memorial Hospital, which once employed 400 people, went bankrupt in 2012 and sat idle for six weeks before McLaren acquired it and re-opened it as a wing of its Petoskey hospital. The Cheboygan medical center is now a skeleton of its former self and employs only 150. Billie Livingston is closing her Cheboygan clothing shop after 28 years. The Center for Michigan | Bridge Magazine  Debating the next chapter The 2008 economic recession hit Cheboygan when she was already down. Since the mid-20th Century, this city has suffered a steady decrease in population; that figure dropped by another 7 percent between 2006 and today. Cheboygan has also lost a whopping 22 percent of its businesses and 16 percent of its jobs in the past decade. "We used to be classified as a retirement community, but retirees can't live here if they have health issues because we don't have a (full-service) hospital," said Livingston. "The nearest hospital is an hour away in Petoskey. What happens if you have a heart attack?" Following the recession, Livingston has also witnessed fewer downstate auto workers come to spend their money. Back in the 1950s and '60s many General Motors workers would buy retirement homes at nearby Mullett Lake. Across the street from Billies, Zany Kitchen, a cooking accessories store, will close after Labor Day. Owner Susan Ball plans to retire after eight years in business. "People ask me 'You can't close the store, where am I gonna shop?'" Ball said. "But I'm 65. I could go another five years, but I don't think anything's going to be different here." Ball said she hopes to spend her winters soaking up the rays in Mexico and visiting her son in Napa Valley, Calif. Billie Livingston, meanwhile, will spend more time with her son who lives near Ann Arbor. "My son said he'll never come back," said Livingston. "Cheboygan needs jobs to bring back young people." As the workers have left, so have the town's young families. Cheboygan once had five grade schools; now it has one. According to City Manager Tom Eustice, the number of students at the high school dropped from 720 to 559 over the past 10 years. The average age in Cheboygan County is 55, said Eustice. Susan Ball is closing her kitchen shop, Zany Kitchen, after Labor Day. "I could go another five years," she said, "but I don't think anything's going to be different here."The Center for Michigan | Bridge Magazine  Ball said she believes that Cheboygan needs to shed its identity as a manufacturing town and more fully embrace tourism. The city sits on Lake Huron, at the mouth of the Cheboygan River, just 20 minutes southeast of the Mackinac Bridge. "Cheboygan has always thought of itself as a manufacturing town because we had Procter & Gamble, but it never recovered after they left," said Ball. "We've been left out because we have not gone after tourism. And the young people who grow up here move away to get a job." A port of hope Meanwhile, the city is working with the Cheboygan Downtown Development Authority and the Chamber of Commerce on a Port of Cheboygan project to develop a domestic and international deep water port. Eustice frames the initiative, underway since 2010 as a way to attract business investment and manufacturing back to Cheboygan. Some business owners think this is the wrong approach. "They're putting the cart before the horse," Livingston said. "We have no industry here. They need to go out and search for industry, first. The city needs to hire a publicist or marketing firm to promote Cheboygan." Ball thinks opening and promoting new businesses related to tourism is the path forward. Tourism is a large part of the economies of nearby Mackinaw City and Petoskey. "Because we have not gone after tourism, we're being left out." Some in Cheboygan are excited about Meijer breaking ground on a retail location outside of town in 2017, but others worry the big-box store will continue to bleed jobs downtown. Another cherished local business, Alcock's Market, shuttered its doors this year after it failed to compete with the Speedway gas station one block away, which had expanded to add beer, wine and pizza by the slice. Cheboygan does have a precious few examples of young people staying in town and running a business. But it's not easy, said Alicia Stanford, 33, who together with her mother runs The Brick Oven outside of town near a Kmart. The pizza restaurant has reduced its service to 4 days a week in the summer and just 1 day a week in the winter. "We're not raking in the dough," said Stanford. "We barely make it."

It has 1.7 billion users, and it knows a ton about them, which is why it did $17 billion in ad revenue last year. But despite years of trying to convince advertisers otherwise, Facebook is still not TV — the place advertisers go when they want to spend huge sums on brand advertising, meant to create overall awareness of their products. Instead, Facebook is the place advertisers go for direct response ads: Ads that send you somewhere when you click on them, so you can buy or download something immediately. Facebook is better at DR ads than anyone — see that second sentence at the top — but DR ads are of limited use for some advertisers. We got a reminder of that today, when the Wall Street Journal reported that P&G, the world’s biggest advertiser, was going to pull back on the targeted ads it was running on Facebook, because targeted ads weren’t helping P&G sell Tide and Pampers. But P&G is increasing its TV budget. P&G isn’t cutting back on its overall Facebook spend, and this news isn’t going to be a long-term problem for Facebook. Remember when GM also declared that Facebook ads don’t work? Back in May 2012? The same week Facebook went public? It worked out for Facebook in the end. But it does underscore why Facebook is running, as fast as it can, to becoming a company that shows you videos, and eventually video ads. Just like TV. recode_divider More From Recode Donald Trump told Tim Cook that Apple is going to ‘build a big plant’ in the U.S. Post-election ‘terror and hysteria’ over Trump is not justified, says Observer editor Ken Kurson Recode Daily: Facebook built a censorship tool that could help it get back into China Can the journalists who work for Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner still cover the White House fairly?

But the pressure is not just reserved for the athletes. The mothers of the three of the gymnasts told “Good Morning America” they are just as nervous as their daughters, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and the youngest team member, 16-year-old Laurie Hernandez. Gabby’s mother, Natalie Hawkins, has been through all of the excitement and nerves of the Olympics before, but said Rio is still hitting her differently. “I think it’s a little different because Gabrielle is four years older and just to see the way she’s handling everything now … More subtle, more grounded,” Hawkins explained from the P&G family home in Rio, where Olympians' families spend time watching events, eating meals and even getting makeovers. Rio Olympics 2016: Gymnastics Star Simone Biles Reveals Her Celebrity Crush, Favorite Food Take Olympic Trivia Quiz to See How Much You Know About the Games Nellie Biles’ daughter Simone is expected to win big as she steps into the Olympics spotlight for the first time. “I think that Simone tries real hard not to pay attention to what the expectation is of others,” said Biles, whose daughter has been predicted to win five gold medals. “I believe there’s more pressure on me than on Simone because I am so nervous. I mean, I am just a wreck. And Simone knows that so she is the one who would text me or call me, ‘Mom, I am doing good and I’m ready.’” As their daughters prepare to compete tonight, the moms are taking it all in-- Especially Wanda Hernandez, whose daughter Laurie is the first U.S. Hispanic-born gymnast to make the Olympic team in 30 years. “Proud, very proud of Laurie,” Hernandez said of her teenage daughter. “And just grateful for the moment. At this point we’re just enjoying the team work, the leaders. Kudos to all of these parents. All the team and all the team moms, and just everybody that competes out there because it’s not just about our girls. Also other girls that have sweat, that have made such an effort whether you’re an elite or you’re college gymnastics or having fun—I can’t do it. “The moment you get on the beam, wow,” she added. “A lot of respect from me. I’m just totally grateful and enjoying the team camaraderie and the fact that Laurie has pure leaders and educators, coaches to look up to. I’m wowed.” When asked if the group of moms had any celebration plans lined for after Thursday, they all laughed while replying, “Yes.” “I have difficulty sleeping so I think my sleep will definitely come starting Friday,” Biles added. There is just one thing their daughters’ team is missing: a nickname. The 1996 gold medal team was known as the “Magnificent Seven.” The 2012 crew was called the “Fierce Five.” As of now, the young ladies of 2016 are still waiting for the right fit. 0 Shares Email Star Comments " Simone Biles’ Mom Ahead of Gymnastics Competition: 'I Am So Nervous' " 'Allied' Review: Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard's Thriller Is 'Nearly Perfect' " Erykah Badu on Music, Family and the Soul Train Music Awards " Corey Feldman Marries Girlfriend Courtney Anne " Video Shows Justin Bieber Allegedly Punching Fan in the Face " Tommy Hilfiger: 'Any Designer Should Be Proud' to Dress Melania Trump " Billy Bob Thornton Opens Up About Humble Childhood " Mariah Carey Breaks Silence on Reported Split With James Packer " Shannen Doherty Teases Photo From 'Heathers' Reboot " Laurie Hernandez Had 'Same Joy' Winning Mirror Ball as She Did Olympic Medals " Spend Thanksgiving Night With OneRepublic, Kelly Clarkson and More " Trump Walks Fine Ethical Line to White House, Experts Say " Wayne State Police Officer in 'Very Grave' Condition After Shooting " Facebook Built 'Censorship Tool' as Part of Chinese Expansion Effort: Report " Thanksgiving Travel Rush: What to Expect Today " Man Injured in Philly Explosion Thought Package Contained Meds: Authorities " Trump's 100-Day Agenda: Experts Examine if It Can Be Done " What Trump Said During Wide-Ranging Interview " Trump 'Seriously Considering' Ben Carson for HUD " Trump 'Leaning' Against Renewed Probe of Clinton, Sources Say " House Republican Criticizes Trump Over Business Conflicts of Interest " Jared Kushner Defends Steve Bannon in Interview, Calls Him an 'Incredible Zionist' " A Look at Gen.

At 12:15 IST, the barometer index, the S&P BSE Sensex, was off 158.13 points or 0.56% at 28,024.44. The Nifty 50 index was currently off 55.55 points or 0.64% at 8,655.80. The losses on the domestic bourses materialized in the wake of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) decision to keep the benchmark lending rate viz. the repo rate unchanged after a policy review in line with market expectations. The Sensex lost 179.09 points or 0.64% at the day's low of 28,003.48 in early afternoon trade, its lowest level since 5 August 2016.

The market breadth indicating the overall health of the market was negative. On BSE, 1,387 shares fell and 1,004 shares rose. A total of 103 shares were unchanged. The BSE Mid-Cap index was currently off 0.79%. The fall in this index was higher than the Sensex's decline in percentage terms. The BSE Small-Cap index was currently off 0.56%, matching the Sensex's fall in percentage terms. In overseas stock markets, most Asian shares rose as US crude oil traded near its highest price in two weeks. US stocks closed lower yesterday, 8 August 2016, after touching record highs as Wall Street caught its breath in the wake of last week's upbeat jobs data. Index heavyweight and cigarette major ITC dropped 1.24% to Rs 246.90. The stock hit a high of Rs 252.40 and low of Rs 246.50 so far during the day. FMCG stocks dropped.

Shree Cement rose 1.37%. Grasim Industries was off 1.57% at Rs 5,205. Grasim has exposure to the cement sector through its holding in UltraTech Cement. SRF rose 3.01% after consolidated net profit rose 27.13% to Rs 144.19 crore on 0.10% decline in total income to Rs 1224.73 crore in Q1 June 2016 over Q1 June 2015. SRF said consolidated net sales declined 0.86% to Rs 1195.08 crore in Q1 June 2016 over Q1 June 2015, mainly due to the consistent subdued commodity prices. The company said that the surge in profitability can be attributed to robust demand, operational efficiency with renewed focus on cost improvement and market penetration especially in the international market. Meanwhile in a separate announcement after market hours yesterday, 8 August 2016, the company said that its board approved setting up third multipurpose plant at SRF's chemical complex in Dahej, Gujarat at an estimated cost of Rs 180 crore. The board also approved setting up Chloromethanes plant at SRF's chemical complex in Dahej, Gujarat at an estimated cost of Rs 165 crore.

The company's net sales declined 0.2% to Rs 673.39 crore in Q1 June 2016 over Q1 June 2015. The result was announced after market hours yesterday, 8 August 2016. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept its benchmark lending rate viz. the repo rate unchanged at 6.5% after a monetary policy review today, 9 August 2016. The RBI also kept the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4% of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL). The central bank said it will continue to provide liquidity as required and will progressively lower the average ex ante liquidity deficit in the system from 1% of NDTL to a position closer to neutrality. The RBI announced the outcome of the monetary policy review at around 11:00 IST. The RBI said that the recent sharper-than-anticipated increase in food prices has pushed up the projected trajectory of inflation over the rest of the year. The central bank also said that the strong improvement in sowing on the back of the monsoon's steady progress, along with supply management measures, augers well for the food inflation outlook. According to the central bank, risks to the inflation target of 5% for March 2017 continue to be on the upside. The RBI has retained the projected GVA growth projection for 2016-17 at 7.6%. According to the central bank, the risk to this projection is evenly balanced. The central bank expects the momentum of growth to be quickened by the normal monsoon raising agricultural growth and rural demand, as well as by the stimulus to consumption spending that can be expected from the disbursement of pay, pension and arrears following the implementation of the 7th CPC's award. The passage of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill augurs well for the growing political consensus for economic reforms. While timely implementation of GST will be challenging, its implementation will raise returns on investment across much of the economy and also strengthen government finances over the medium-term, according to the central bank. The RBI said that the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and will continue to emphasise the adequate provision of liquidity. According to the central bank, easy liquidity conditions are already prompting banks to modestly transmit past policy rate cuts through their MCLRs (Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate) and pro-active liquidity management should facilitate more pass-through. Meanwhile, the amended goods and services tax (GST) constitutional amendment bill was passed by the Lok Sabha yesterday, 8 August 2016. The bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha last week. Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Lok Sabha said that with GST, the government intends to bring uniformity in taxation. Most of the things that can impact consumer inflation have been kept out of the ambit of GST, Modi said. He was intervening during the debate in the Lok Sabha on the GST Bill yesterday, 8 August 2016. The government plans to implement the nationwide GST from 1 April 2017. The main objective of the GST is to eliminate excessive taxation. GST is a uniform indirect tax levied on goods and services across a country. The measure would harmonize 11 state and central levies into a national sales tax, reducing business transaction costs.

Thursday, November 24, 2016 News Sarawak State Election 2016 Nation Sabah World Brunei Kalimantan Business Sports Football General Tennis Badminton Utusan Borneo Berita Sarawak Berita Sabah Berita Nasional Berita Iban Sukan thesundaypost Columns BPO Seeds BAT Business  Slow recovery expected for IOI following RSPO suspension lift August 9, 2016, Tuesday Ronnie Teo, ronnieteo@theborneopost.com The lifting of the RSPO suspension from August 8 means that there would be a five month impact on IOI’s earnings. KUCHING: Analysts expect a slow recovery for IOI Corporation Bhd (IOI) following Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil’s (RSPO) endorsement of the lifting of its suspension effective yesterday. IOI will continue to submit its quarterly progress report to the RSPO. At the end of a 12-month period, the Complaints Panel will again commission an independent ground verification by a team of experts, following which a review of the complaint will be undertaken by the panel. Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd (Kenanga Research) was not surprised as it earlier noted that the required documents had been filed and was pending feedback. However, it forewarned that earnings recovery may not be immediately felt given loss of clients and  reputational damage. “While the news come as a positive boost to sentiment, we note that earnings recovery may not be felt immediately given the loss of major multi-national corporation (MNC) clients such as Unilever, P&G, and Cargill, among others,” it said in a note. “We believe full client recovery may take time, while new MNC clients could be dissuaded given reputation damage suffered from the suspension. “However, earnings from mid-1Q17 should see improvement with the recovery of certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO) premiums. RHB Research Institute Sdn Bhd (RHB Research) similarly believed a full reversal of negative impact to bottom line may take some time. The lifting of the RSPO suspension from August 8 means that there would be a five month impact on IOI’s earnings. “While this would have an immediate positive impact on earnings for the upstream division – as IOI would be able to sell its CSPO again – the impact to the downstream division may take a longer time. “This is due to the fact that downstream customers, who have already severed contracts with IOI may have already found other suppliers, or may take a longer time to trust IOI again.” RHB Research further said the verification processes conducted by the downstream customers to ensure that the sustainability criteria is met may take a longer time. “This could result in IOI not being able to regain this portion of its downstream business for a few additional months,” it added. Nevertheless, MIDF Amanah Investment Bank Bhd (MIDF Research) said the faster than expected uplift of suspension is positive for IOI’s share price. “The uplift is not a surprise as we have written in our June report that we believe that IOI suspension may be lifted in in less than a year given its proactive stance. “However, the speed of the uplift has surprised us. All in, the suspension has been ongoing for only less than five months.” What do you think of this story?

Home In Corporate March to Clean Energy, Utilities Not Required Instead of waiting for large utilities to go greener, companies are buying renewable energy directly, upending the traditional system. By Jan Ellen Spiegel, InsideClimate News Aug 8, 2016 Google is one of the companies leading the trend toward direct corporate purchase of clean energy through power purchase agreements. Credit: Getty Images A curious thing happened while U.S. utilities were focusing on cheap fracked gas, expensive nuclear power, what to do about coal, and how to fight  renewable energy models that threatened their bottom line. Some of the nation's largest corporations decided not to wait for utilities and took their interest in renewable energy into their own hands. They bought their own clean power. And they bought it directly from the companies that produced it. No utility middleman needed. This clean power revolt, led by some of the biggest corporate energy consumers, is the latest threat to the power purchase and delivery system that's been in place since Thomas Edison invented it. Could this be what gets utilities' attention and forces them to consider clean energy as the future instead of the enemy? Will it ultimately lead to the greening of all of America's power? "It's a really interesting question and I don't know the answer," said Blaine Collison, managing director of marketing and strategic partnerships at Altenex, an energy management company that has orchestrated direct energy purchases for Microsoft, Home Depot, Walmart, Procter and Gamble, Yahoo, Bloomberg and 3M, among others. "What I do know is that we've got a very significant number of massive employers and drivers of American economic output that have said, 'Okay, we want renewables and we're not satisfied with the current options that are available to us. So we're going out into the market and getting renewables for ourselves.'" Many experts say there is more of this to come, and that utilities will not sit back and let this market pass them by. The trend was spearheaded by the elite of the Fortune 500, especially those companies with electricity-guzzling data centers and manufacturing operations such as Google, Amazon and Walmart. Most have climate change concerns and want to boost their green portfolio—their customers wanted that, too—and to make the cost of power more predictable. And so they turned to an old, basic energy project financing model: a power purchase agreement, commonly called a PPA. Traditionally, a utility agrees to buy power for a long time from a generator, giving the builder of an energy plant the stability to attract financing for its construction. The utility then resells power to its customers. But in PPA 2.0, big customers started asking independent renewable power developers to build the installations, usually off-site and sometimes not even in the same state. The companies  signed contracts to buy the electricity virtually for a decade or longer. The trend line has been startling in the last few years, with more than 3.2 gigawatts of corporate renewable deals in 2015—most of them PPAs. That's more than double the amount in 2014. Municipalities, universities, and other institutions are adopting the model. And the temporary renewal of tax credits for wind and solar at the end of last year makes now an ideal time to jump in. Credit: DAVID MCNEW/AFP/Getty Images The windfall has been biggest for the wind power industry. Wind vastly outstrips solar as the corporate PPA power of choice. For 2015 and the first part of this year, about 2,800 megawatts of wind power contracted for corporate PPAs to only a little more than 800 megawatts of solar, according to a Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) analysis. "The rise of corporate buyer demand is very exciting for the wind industry," said Hannah Hunt, senior analyst for American Wind Energy Association. She called it a complement to the increasing wind purchases by utilities themselves, which she said was being propelled by better technology and improved siting that has cut the cost of wind by two-thirds over the last six years. Hervé Touati, managing director of RMI, called the trend "a very strong signal and an indication of the role corporate buyers can play." Companies considering PPAs are generally seeking larger amounts of renewable power than they can get putting a solar system on their roof, at a rate that's lower than the prevailing cost of electricity, locked in for 15 to 25 years. Some utilities are getting the message and working with companies to arrange competitive terms. Google is one of the earliest and largest adopters. In the last six years the company has structured more than a dozen PPAs totaling nearly 1,900 megawatts as it tries to reach its goal of 100 percent renewable power. They include one announced late last year through Duke Energy for solar in North Carolina. Amazon, also looking to be 100 percent renewable, has contracted for power from several wind farms and a solar installation for nearly 550 megawatts. It structured a solar PPA in Virginia through Dominion. Credit: IKEA The ranks of PPA purchasers include Walmart, Equinix, Microsoft and IKEA to round out the top half-dozen. General Motors is a recent addition. In 2011, GM set a goal of 125 megawatts of renewable energy by 2020. Twenty-two solar, three landfill gas, one waste-to-energy and one hydro installation later, the company is now at 106 megawatts. The largest solar system is just under 12 megawatts. "Even if we put up solar and covered the entire rooftop of our assembly plant, I'd maybe get 20 or 30 percent of our full load," said Rob Threlkeld, GM's global manager of renewable energy. "That's why we started to look at PPAs." Last year GM announced two wind PPAs—one 34-megawatt for several manufacturing facilities in Mexico, another 30-megawatt for an assembly plant in Texas. When the Mexico PPA goes online in a couple of months, it will put GM over its renewable goal four years early. Each plant will save the company $2 million annually for the life of the contract. Experts expect much more is coming, and soon. A survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in conjunction with the American Council for Renewable Energy (ACORE), which has also studied the corporate PPA phenomenon, sampled U.S.-headquartered companies with large energy footprints. Seventy-two percent of respondents said they were actively pursuing renewable energy purchases, mainly PPAs. So far, only 18 Fortune 500 firms have signed renewable PPAs, plus another 10 or so other companies. Last year's jump in contracts was partly attributable to uncertainty over the expiring tax credits. That sent many companies scrambling to lock in projects before the Dec. 31 deadline. The credits were extended for five years, driving the 2016 corporate renewable PPA pace below 2015. Experts said companies felt they could take a little more time with their decisions now. While the renewed tax breaks will clearly help, according to many people, the key driver behind PPA decisions was sustainability, not money. Many companies now have sustainability and renewable energy goals. And more and more investors, partners, stockholders and customers expect a company to address sustainability and climate change. "I don't believe that large corporations are leading this," said RMI's Touati. "I believe that customers are leading this." Either way, the price increasingly is right. "You don't have to use your own capital," noted George Favaloro, managing director for sustainable business solutions and head of the corporate energy transformation practice at PriceWaterhouse. He was the lead author of its survey. PPAs also avoid energy market price volatility. They lower energy costs. They don't require a company to have a large amount of land. But corporate PPAs do have shortcomings and risks. "The biggest risk is long-term contracts," GM's Threlkeld said. "What's the market going to look like in 10 to 15 years? What's our manufacturing presence in that state or country going look like in 10 to 15 years?" The trend also presents complex questions for the utilities. In Las Vegas, two major hotels—MGM and Wynn Resorts—have said they will pay hefty fees to leave the local utility, NV Energy, so they can buy renewable power. That was after they were unable to work out renewable deals with the utility. Such situations could portend even larger economic ramifications said Greg Wetstone, president of ACORE. "We may have companies saying, 'Look we don't want to come to your state if you're structured in a way that we can't buy the power we want,'" he said. "That's a very compelling economic message." Utilities appear to be listening. "Frankly I haven't heard any worry at all . I've heard more enthusiasm than anything," said Phil Moeller, vice president for energy delivery and chief customer solutions officer at the Edison Electric Institute, the trade association for investor-owned utilities. "The typical issues related to it from a utility's perspective —perhaps you have to include some balancing capability if it's just one fuel, and that fuel isn't available all the time. "That's really not a high hurdle."   Collison of Altenex said there are broader considerations, beyond any one utility. "It's a really interesting intersection of a market opportunity and a set of outcomes that has huge net benefits for the developer, for the power user, for climate change," he said. "This is about changing the U.S. generation portfolio. "It's pretty neat to see the corporates say 'look we want it and we're not waiting.'"

On BSE, 1,460 shares rose and 880 shares fell. A total of 105 shares were unchanged. The BSE Mid-Cap index was currently up 0.67%. The BSE Small-Cap index was currently up 0.66%. Both these indices outperformed the Sensex. In overseas stock markets, Asia markets were trading higher with sentiment underpinned by a stronger-than-expected US jobs report released on Friday, 5 August 2016. The US economy is the world's largest economy. Japanese stocks edged higher as the yen weakened amid the dollar's broad strength driven up upbeat job data. The Nikkei 225 index was currently up 2.23%. Chinese shares shrugged off weak trade data. In mainland China, the Shanghai Composite was currently up 0.44%. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index was currently up 1.25%. China's exports continued to fall in dollar terms in July 2016 from a year earlier, as global demand for goods from the world's second-largest economy remained sluggish. Exports slid 4.4% in July 2016 from a year earlier, following a decline of 4.8% in June 2016. Imports fell 12.5% in July 2016, compared with an 8.4% decrease in June 2016. US stocks edged higher during the previous trading session on Friday, 5 August 2016, with the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite index settling at all-time closing highs, after a stronger-than-expected jobs report. The US economy added 255,000 jobs in July 2016, which follows a stellar gain in June, demonstrating that the economy is still healthy, despite relatively muted gross domestic product. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.9% even as the labor-force participation rate edged up to 62.8%, suggesting the labor market is tightening. FMCG stocks were mixed. Britannia Industries (up 1.78%), Hindustan Unilever (up 0.5%), Marico (up 2.64%), Procter & Gamble Hygiene and Health Care (up 2.81%) and Bajaj Corp (up 0.39%) rose.

The stock was up 3.01% at Rs 1,294.90. The stock hit a high of Rs 1,298.90 so far during the day, which is a record high for the counter. The stock hit a low of Rs 1,270.90 so far during the day. The RBI raised the ceiling on investment by FIIs in HPCL after approval for the proposal from the company's board of directors and shareholders. Meanwhile, the amendments made by Rajya Sabha in the constitutional amendment bill on Goods and Services Tax (GST) will be taken up for its passage by the Lok Sabha this week. The amended GST constitutional amendment bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha last week. The passage of the constitutional amendment bill in the Rajya Sabha kicks off a legislative marathon in which the Parliament and state assemblies will need to pass further laws setting the rate and scope of the GST. The government plans to implement the nationwide GST from 1 April 2017. The main objective of the GST is to eliminate excessive taxation. GST is a uniform indirect tax levied on goods and services across a country. The measure would harmonize 11 state and central levies into a national sales tax, reducing business transaction costs. On the macro front, the government in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has notified consumer price inflation target of 4% with upper tolerance level of 6% and lower tolerance level of 2% to be achieved by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The government notified the inflation target range of 2% to 6% in the Official Gazette on Friday, 5 August 2016 and it will be valid until 31 March 2021. The inflation target is to be fixed by the central government in consultation with the RBI once in every five years. According a statement from to the finance ministry, the key advantage of a range around a target is that it allows the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to recognise the short run trade-offs between inflation and growth but enables it to pursue the inflation target in long run over the course of business cycle. The range also accommodates data limitations, projection errors, short-run supply gaps and instability in the agriculture production, an important factor for CPI inflation, as food articles have a major weight in the CPI indices. It also allows to accommodate unanticipated short-term shocks even while nudging public inflation expectations on the centre of the range, to which the monetary policy will return the economy over the medium term, leading to transparency and predictability. If the average inflation is more than the upper tolerance level of 4% + 2%, that is, 6%, or less than the lower tolerance level of 4% - 2%, that is 2%, for any three consecutive quarters, it would mean a failure to achieve the inflation target. Where RBI fails to meet the inflation target, in terms of the provisions of RBI Act, it shall set out a report to the Central Government stating the reasons for failure to achieve the inflation target, remedial actions proposed to be taken by RBI and an estimate of the time-period within which the inflation target shall be achieved pursuant to timely implementation of proposed remedial actions. The government has initiated the process of shifting to a framework of Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) for deciding interest rates. RBI currently sets the rates. The RBI is set to announce monetary policy decision at 11:00 IST tomorrow, 9 August 2016, after a policy review.

The government has initiated the process of shifting to a framework of Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) for deciding interest rates. RBI currently sets the rates. The RBI is set to announce monetary policy decision at 11:00 IST tomorrow, 9 August 2016, after a policy review.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 8 August 2016 | MYT 11:22 AM PIVB Research ups IOI Corp target price to RM4.78 KUALA LUMPUR: PublicInvest Research (PIVB) Research has raised the 12 month target price for IOI Corporation Bhd to RM4.78 from RM4.55 after the Roundable of Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) lifted the suspension from Monday after four months.  “We welcome the decision, however, it is going to take time for IOI Corp to recover lost customer base. Nevertheless, we expect its earnings to gradually improve going forward,” it said on Monday. The research house said with the withdrawal of RSPO membership suspension, it adjusted its earnings forecasts to the pre-suspension level. This will see its sum-of-part based target price enhanced from RM4.55 to RM4.78. Maintain Neutral call. IOI Corp’s RSPO membership was suspended on March 28 due to non-compliance with some of RSPO’s rules on possessing environment permits and clearing of fragile land in Indonesia’s West Kalimantan province.  Following that, its major customers, namely, Unilever, Colgate-Palmolive, Hershey’s, Johnson & Johnson, Kellogg, Mars, Nestle, SC Johson, Yum! Brands, Procter & Gamble and Rectitt Benckiser have stopped sourcing palm oil products from IOI Corp’s subsidiary, IOI Loders Croklaan and switched their suppliers to counterparts like KLK, Sime Darby and Wilmar.  “This resulted in monetary losses like CSPO premium and customer base. Other non-monetary losses include reputation. “IOI Corp reported total fresh fruit bunches (FFB) production of 3.14 million tonnes of FFB, which accounted for 97% of our full-year forecasts. The 4Q production had the steepest decline due to the strong El Nino’s impact. Nevertheless, we expect production growth to turn positive in the 2H 2016 as June production’s decline has softened significantly. “IOI Corp is expected to announce its 4QFY16 results on 23 Aug. We think the results may be dragged by weaker FFB production and FX translation loss as our Ringgit weakened 3.8995 to 4.0288 against the US dollar. 4Q suffered the steepest production drop, down 171,012mt or 19.2% YoY. “Reversing our earnings forecasts to the pre-suspension level. Following the withdrawal of suspension, we input higher earnings forecasts for FY17-19 with an increase of 3-5%.  “Although it will be a major challenge for the Group to win back its lost customers, we believe its strong profile coupled with its sizeable downstream capacity would help to re-establish its tainted value chain in the medium term,” it said.

The growth, or lack of it, sent shares tanking the day after the earnings call, but that's to be expected for a company in transition. Now investors will be looking to the new CEO to deliver investors to the promised land. Maxx Chatsko (TMFBlacknGold) Aug 9, 2016 at 6:14PM Image source: Flickr.fdecomite. Food and specialty ingredients manufacturer TerraVia (NASDAQ:TVIA) has been relatively quiet since changing its name and ticker symbol from Solazyme, which spawned the current technology platform and business relationship with joint-venture partner Bunge, in May. While investors may always want more news and updates, the self-induced quiet period was needed for the company to focus on its transition away from fuel and industrial markets toward higher value markets that are more likely to deliver capital-efficient growth sooner. Of course, the company did pick its head up for a brief time this week to discuss second-quarter earnings with shareholders. Growth was lackluster, but a new CEO was announced. Can investors pin their hopes on the new leader? By the numbers You can check the press release for the full financial details, but here are the important metrics for investors to focus on. Metric Q2 2016 Q2 2015 % Change Product revenue $6.3 million $8.3 million (24.1%) Algenist revenue* $5.5 million $5.2 million 5.7% Collaboration revenue $3.6 million $3.4 million 4.6% Total revenue $9.9 million $11.7 million (15.3%) Operating expenses $27.1 million $38.1 million (28.9%) Cash and cash equivalents $82.5 million $97.9 million (15.7%) Data source: TerraVia press release. *Included in product revenue. These numbers and year-over-year comparisons are a bit complicated for a couple of reasons that are worth understanding before panicking. First, the second quarter of last year includes product revenue from industrial products including fuels and drilling lubricants, while the most recent quarter does not. Second, the loss of industrial product revenue masks the relative strength of youthful food ingredient brands that grew nearly 200% in the comparison period. They grew from very small bases, but the growth is encouraging, given their new importance in TerraVia's future. Compared with the first half of 2015, during the first half of 2016 sales of food ingredients grew 170%, joint venture products grew 290%, industrials products slipped 80%, and Algenist remained flat. The turnaround won't happen overnight, but investors have little to complain about concerning the current strategy. Importantly, TerraVia continues to slash operating expenses, mostly from a major reduction in headcount at the end of 2015, and has a respectable amount of cash in the bank. But it's better than it seems. Not only do the aforementioned numbers not include a $20 million payment from Tengram for a majority interest (80%) in the company's cosmetic skincare line, Algenist, but going forward the company will avoid between $10 million and $15 million per year in marketing expenses related to the brand. That will help to further conserve cash and expand the company's runway before it needs to raise more funding for growth. Looking forward Some investors may be wondering why TerraVia parted ways with a majority stake in Algenist for only $20 million to Tengram. Isn't it a high-flying brand growing year after year? Doesn't the future potential represent revenue totals much greater than where the brand sits today? As always, it's a bit complicated, but the numbers have shown that Algenist was having problems growing for quite a few quarters. That's not to say that the brand is done growing, but whatever Solazyme/TerraVia was doing simply wasn't working. Image source: compiled by author, with data from SEC filings and TerraVia press release. Therefore, it simply made sense to sell 80% of the brand to a group that has the potential to continue growing it. Solazyme will still supply the key algae ingredients for Algenist products to Tengram, but that shouldn't amount to more than a few million dollars per year at current revenue levels. With Algenist on its way out, the most significant direct consumer brand now is Thrive culinary algae oil. Good news: Retail unit sales were up 200% in the second quarter, compared with the first quarter of 2016, while TerraVia is planning to expand the brand's retail footprint by 300% in the third quarter to more than 200 stores. Again, while the brand is growing from a very small base of revenue, it does appear to have traction. It's now the dominant cooking oil I use at home, but, admittedly, I'm far from a chef whose opinion holds sway. The most significant update from TerraVia was, of course, the announcement that the search for its next CEO was over. Co-founder, Chairman, and current CEO Jonathan Wolfson will step down at the end of August while retaining his role as chairman of the board. At that time, Apu Mody will become the new CEO. Mody's most recent position was president of Mars Food America, where he turned the North American region into the company's fastest-growing segment. He has also served in important roles at Del Monte Foods, Procter & Gamble, and the Grocery Manufacturers of America. Put another way, Mody has the experience and network needed to give TerraVia brands the exposure and opportunities required for growth. Those brands now include AlgaWise oils (a joint-venture product), AlgaVia whole algae ingredients, Thrive culinary oil, AlgaPrime DHA aquaculture and animal feed, and AlgaPur specialty ingredients. That's not a bad bunch to pin growth prospects on, although it certainly won't be easy. What does it mean for investors? TerraVia has a great portfolio of high-value food and specialty ingredients that could grow into a profitable, cash-generating company. It's important for investors to realize that the transition will take time -- as in several years -- and that even if the new company proves successful, the baggage of past mistakes does limit management's degrees of freedom. That could affect the decisions made to finance growth and the ability to acquire synergistic brands and technologies, and it could also result in dilution for existing shareholders. For now, it's simply too early to say how this will turn out. Maxx Chatsko has no position in any stocks mentioned. Follow him on Twitter to keep up with developments in the engineered biology field.

BALAKRISHNAN Published  Aug 10, 2016, 1:44 am IST Updated  Aug 10, 2016, 1:44 am IST There is a strange phenomenon in the air. As the market keeps going higher, we all feel very wise about our stock picking skills. There is a strange phenomenon in the air. As the market keeps going higher, we all feel very wise about our stock picking skills. Almost everything we ‘identify’ for possible investment seems to keep going up. Truly, this makes an expert out of all of us. These are great times to be in the stock market. In fact, we feel left out if we are not in. The mutual fund folios in equity mutual funds are hitting new records. It seems like it is the last train leaving the town and everyone wants to be on board. I read a foreign brokerage report that says that our markets are ‘expensive’ relative to historic valuations. However, being a brokerage, it has to keep printing, “buy” ideas so that its investment banking business and corporate finance business do not suffer. So it hastens to add that our markets are not as expensive as some other ‘emerging’ markets in some global baskets. What is interesting to see is that most written off sectors seem to be back in favour. Commodities, finance, PSUs etc., are favoured. Even textiles, auto ancillaries and plastic fabricators seem to be headed to stratospheric valuations. The interesting thing is that globally, markets seem to be hot. Valuation rules are changed to justify higher and higher valuation for the unchanged earnings outlooks or potential. For example, we like to hear that GST will be a miracle boost for valuations. Pause. GST simply means higher or lower prices to everyone and competition will ensure that profitability is not abnormal for anyone. Retail or business prices will adjust to the new effective rate of taxation. Similarly, any company getting to even make a screwdriver that would be used by the defence sector gets a huge valuation kicker. Be cautious. While it may mean additional revenue for a few companies, by and large it would not mean a corresponding earnings growth. I could be wrong if the market re-rates the valuation for these companies, giving multiples that are patently not related to the fundamentals. It has happened. You have to look at valuation of stocks of companies like Gillette or P&G. One thing to focus on in this market is “liquidity”. In a bull market, you end up buying things easily. Check on the number of shareholders and the spread thereof. There are ‘hot’ mid-caps with less than 10,000 shareholders! What it means is that in a bull run, they will climb quickly. In a corrective phase, there would be only sellers and you will find it difficult to even sell 50 shares without taking a steep cut from the quoted price. Midcaps are by nature illiquid. One other thing that can be spotted is that volumes increase with price rise. Stocks, which hardly traded a few hundred shares a day, become actively traded once the price jumps up. These are classic signs of operator-driven action and often end up as poor stories. So what does one do in this market Have you heard of a concept called “drug holiday” Here is an extract from Wikipedia: “A drug holiday (sometimes also called a drug vacation is when a patient stops taking a medication(s) for a period of time; anywhere from a few days to many months or even years if they feel it is in their best interests. Plan-ned drug holidays are used in numerous fields of medicine. They are best known in HIV therapy.” Many of us are addicted to the stock markets. A break is strongly recommended. It will help one to conserve one’s resources. And also prevent us from building a ‘long term’ portfolio out of short-term trades that go wrong. Markets will find a reason to correct or stagnate for a long period of time, till the earnings catch up with valuation. Yes, liquidity can do strange things for continued periods of time, but then, the odds of making a great return from stocks keeps going down as valuations keep going up. It is time to exercise caution. Reduce exposure to equities. I am fairly sure that we will get better opportunities. After all, we surely have a window of anything from 20 to 40 years where one would be adding to the investment portfolio. And you do get five to 10 opportunities in that. Get “detoxified”. It is good for your financial health. Keep adding to knowledge. Make a list of what stocks you would like to own. Write a ‘buy’ price against it. Wait. The odds of making money to losing money in the stock markets at this juncture makes me content to stay on the sidelines.

The Bard himself stars in this new campaign, which started airing during the Olympics. He wants to get a certain Sarah to pay more attention to her dental health so she won’t have to stay home from school. Wait… One might assume that most high school/middle school kids would prefer to catch up on social media rather than discussing The Bard. Plus, there are so many film versions of Hamlet to choose from! But then Shakespeare’s work does have more than its share of sex and violence, and high school kids care more about grades and college admissions than anything else, right? Dennis Legault, the client’s North American oral health marketing director, told AdAge yesterday that kids “still miss school because of various dental things going on. So it is broadly affecting the population.” This will be a long-term effort for P&G, which wants to tie more of its marketing campaigns back to public good advocacy efforts like preventing kids from scoring lower on standardized tests because their teeth hurt. The work vaguely reminds us of Erich & Kallman’s historical, star-studded debut campaign for Chick-Fil-A. Michaelangelo would definitely need to brush his teeth after eating an egg and cheese sandwich in the Sistene Chapel, but we’re pretty sure they just gargled some water and called it a day in the 16th century. Dental care was pretty awful back then, BTW. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The PowerShares High Yield Equity Dividend Achievers Portfolio (NYSEArca: PEY) is one ETF that can position investors for years of consistent, dependable dividends. “PEY follows the Nasdaq U.S. Dividend Achievers Index, which selects companies based on a combination of dividend growth and yield. This ETF holds 50 companies with over 42% of the fund’s combined weight allocated to the utilities and energy sectors,” according to InvestorPlace. Dividend growers provide an aspect of quality and growth since these firms have a long track record of raising dividends. Related: Best of Both Worlds With This Dividend ETF Stocks with steady dividend yields reassure investors of a company’s strong financial health. Additionally, dividend-paying stocks typically outperform those that do not pay over the long haul, with less volatility, due to the compounding effect of dividends on the investment’s overall return. Over the past 40 years, companies that boost payouts have proven to be less volatile than their counterparts that cut, suspended or did not initiate or raise dividends. “In looking at some of the ETF’s top holdings it’s no surprise to find big telecom names like Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T), as well as tobacco plays like Altria Group (NYSE:MO) and smaller tobacco companies like Vector Group (NYSE:VGR). Sector-wise, utility stocks make up 20% of the overall ETF holdings, followed by financial services at 17%, and consumer-defensive stocks like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Kellogg (NYSE:K)and General Mills (NYSE:GIS), with that group making up 16% of the ETF’s overall holdings,” according to ETF Daily News.

When the obsession with yield will end is anyone’s guess. Perhaps the Federal Reserve actually raising interest rates will be the remedy to offset set what appears more and more to be a yield-chasing bubble which has resulted in record-highs in terms of valuation,” adds ETF Daily News.

At this confession, her four teammates dissolved into giggles of agreement. “Um, in the back, I thought I was gonna die,” Simone Biles admitted. “Yes!” Raisman replied. “In the bathroom, when me and you were in the bathroom, I asked you, ‘Are you okay?’” Raisman paused. “And I was like, ‘Me neither.’” At that point the gathered women began sharing their nerves-before-competition stories, talking over each other with giddy mentions of the shaking hands and near-vom experiences that came when they finally—finally—found themselves on the Olympic stage. “We just sat there,” Biles said, recalling those tense pre-competition moments, “and we were like”—and then the three-time all-around world champion, the woman an NBC commentator referred to earlier in the evening as “the greatest of all time,” made a dramatic shruggie gesture. In response to which: Her team giggled some more. Related Story The Weird Athleticism of the Victoria's Secret Model NBC’s roving cameras caught that off-stage exchange—superhumans, acting in a decidedly human fashion—after the five women had clinched the U.S.’s spot to compete for team gold in Rio. But the athletes (also known as “Team USA,” the “Fierce Five: Redux,” and “The Most Dominant U.S. Gymnastics Team Ever Assembled”) didn’t merely secure the team’s place in the finals, and they didn’t merely come away with a first-place ranking heading into the competition that will determine who wins medals. Instead, they smashed through the high expectations set for them. And yet here they were, after their big, if unsurprising, victory, commiserating and confessing and laughing and acting, in the end, like exactly what they are: a group of young—very young—women. Women’s gymnastics is traditionally one of the most-watched events of the summer Games—much more popular than its masculine counterpart, which features similar feats of super-human strength and skill. (The rings! THE RINGS.) That’s in part because women’s gymnastics is, as entertainment, riveting—the balance beam alone is basically a 4-inch-thick hunk of Hitchcock—but it is also, likely, because the sport presents collisions of a more cultural strain. Here are young women, bedecked of bow and bedazzled of leotard, flexing and flipping and generally giving a massive side-eye to gravity itself. Here are the performance of sport and the performance of femininity, united in a singular, if extremely precarious, harmony. The team’s leos will feature nearly 5,000 crystals in designs that evoke shooting stars and swirling clouds. In that sense, women’s gymnastics captivates because it insinuates: The sport serves, on top of everything else, as a metaphor for a cultural moment that is appending notions of strength (and not just “moral strength”) to womanhood. It exemplifies the tensions of a time that is newly distinguishing between the female and the feminine. It’s a sport, too, with an undeniably political edge: Women’s gymnastics, like this particular moment in feminism, pays lip service to ideals of “empowerment,” but its workings are underscored by the knowledge that years’ worth of effort can, through gravity’s apathy, be undone in a single instant. Sweaty and sparkly, muscular and girly, explosive and controlled: Gymnastics is the successful execution of many different balancing acts. * * * Women’s gymnastics, in its current form, owes a lot both to second-wave feminism and to Title IX—which brought about the general de-dainty-ization of the traditionally balletic sport. (“Before the 1970s,” the essayist Meghan O’Rourke points out, “women’s gymnastics had been snoozy and staid, resembling, as a Sports Illustrated writer put it, ‘a lyrical exercise somewhere this side of ballet.’”) A recent change in the sport’s scoring system, which took away the long-standing cap of 10, allowed for ever-upward difficulty levels in routines, which in turn further emphasized feat-affording strength among its athletes. It may have preserved its official name—“artistic gymnastics”—amid all these changes, but the sport’s champions ascend by embracing moves that are traditionally not “ladylike”: leaping, grasping, thudding, punching the air after a stuck landing. Gymnastics is determinedly unladylike in another way, too: It is for the most part practiced, at the elite levels, only by very young women (the current U.S. team ranges in age from 16 to 22). This is emphasized in an aesthetic that borrows heavily from what you might call “pageant chic.” Team USA is known, in particular, for its bedazzled competition uniforms, and each Olympics has brought with it leotards that are more crystal-encrusted—with Swarovski versions, as “they have the most shine and sparkle”—than the last. (Given how much of a “typical” adolescence elite gymnasts are made to sacrifice in their athletic pursuits, it’s at this point a cliche of the sport to talk about their sparkling competition leotards as their “prom dresses.”) This year, The New York Times reports, the women’s leos will feature nearly 5,000 individual crystals—in designs that evoke shooting stars and swirling clouds and the other stuff of dreams fulfilled. Stories from the games in Rio Read more Dramatic makeup, too, is a mainstay of the gymnastics floor—Biles, last night, wore sparkling eyeliner that mimicked the swooping lines of the team leo—as are manicured fingers and pedicured toes. (This is perhaps because USA Gymnastics stipulates, without a bit of irony, that each athlete competing under its auspices must be “well groomed in her appearance.”) On Sunday, NBC’s omniscient camera caught Madison Kocian, the 19-year-old whose specialty is the uneven bars, kneeling on the floor after having executed a nearly perfect routine. She was zipping her chalk-covered grips into a hot-pink makeup bag. It’s not only gymnasts, of course, who embrace their femininity on the field of play. Hair ribbons are a mainstay of women’s softball. Brandi Chastain celebrated her scoring of the U.S. women’s soccer team’s game-winning penalty shot against China by taking off her shirt to reveal her sports bra. Flo-Jo was known for her elaborate manicures, and in her spirit, this time around, come—among others—the French basketball player Emmeline Ndongue, who wears patriotic stripes on her nails, and the American volleyball player Destinee Hooker, whose manicure sports the union flag and the Olympic rings. Procter & Gamble went so far as to set up a nail salon in the Olympic village so that athletes—presumably women—might similarly bedazzle themselves. Women’s gymnastics, though, is notable for something beyond its athletes’ embrace of their femininity: its simultaneous embarrassment about their femaleness. Women gymnasts have come to resemble swimmers in their uniform lack of body hair—waxing being an unspoken mandate that has as much to do with aesthetics as with aerodynamics. (Well groomed in her appearance.) The gymnasts’ outfits, too, their snazzy sparkles notwithstanding, suggest a certain abashedness about the female form: Judges are free to deduct points for underwear that peeks out from beyond the athletes’ leos. It’s a sartorial awkwardness that reflects a more systemic one. In gymnastics, the body fat that is a typical signal of healthy womanhood is stubbornly burned off. The development of breasts has curtailed otherwise promising careers. The rigors of training—coupled with eating disorders that have been known to afflict its athletes—can delay menstruation. Women’s gymnastics, on the whole, may celebrate its eponymous “women”; it is also, however, decidedly ambivalent about them. Many of its workings suggest a preference to see those women, whatever their age and achievement, as girls. USA Gymnastics stipulates, without a hint of irony, that each athlete must be “well groomed in her appearance.” And then, of course, there are allegations of sexual abuse that have long cast a shadow over the sport. Joan Ryan’s 1995 book, Little Girls in Pretty Boxes, told stories not just of bullying young athletes have endured at the hands of their coaches, but of abuse. USA Gymnastics banned Don Peters, the coach of the 1984 Olympic team, from the sport after several of the athletes he’d trained made accusations against him—but it didn’t do so until 2011. Last week, the IndyStar released the results of a lengthy investigation into the matter, concluding that USAG has “turned a blind eye to sex abuse.” The tension, across the sport’s elite levels—a dynamic of fragility and strength, of empowerment and its opposite—has escalated to such a degree that some critics have wondered whether watching women’s gymnastics is, at this point, unethical. One of those wonderings, however, accompanied its text—ironically, or perhaps fittingly, and either way revealingly—with artistic photographs of Olympian and other elite gymnasts that emphasized not just the athletes’ muscles, but also their manicures and hairdos and, in a couple of cases, their crotches. * * * In that, gymnastics is an extreme reflection of a widespread cultural ambivalence—about youth in general, perhaps, but about girlhood in particular. On the one hand, “empowerment” is the ethic of the moment, via toys and clothes and media messaging that seek to downplay gender as a factor in a young person’s life. NBC, on Sunday, featured a bio package with Gabby Douglas, one of the stars who emerged from the London Games (and the other gymnast—with Raisman—who is representing the U.S., in 2016, for her second Olympics). Douglas, in an interview, cited Serena Williams as one of her role models, and her explanation reflected the feminist messaging of the moment. “She’s just so dominant,” the star gymnast said of the tennis star, “and she just goes after what she wants, and she’s just so aggressive. I love strong, empowered women.” Gymnastics, even more than other sports, emphasizes the challenges gravity-bound women must navigate. In the same series of Better Know an Athlete packages, though, NBC emphasized, for Simone Biles, not her dominance or her aggression, but instead her … girly femininity. Biles’s short documentary featured footage of the young athlete grinning at the camera while getting a manicure (and requesting that her nails be done in patriotic red and blue). The young champion, Bob Costas intoned, “in any other context might seem like any other teenager”—and his thesis was proven, again and again. “She loves girly stuff,” Biles’s mother shared in an interview for the package, “so she loves to shop and she loves to get her hair done, her nails done. She likes to feel pretty.” Her father, in a separate interview, agreed: “She’s a teenager. A typical female teenager.” These mini-movies will always, across sports and across Games, engage in a kind of doubling: Their point is to emphasize the ordinariness of athletes who have chosen lives that are, by definition, anything but ordinary—and to make those athletes relatable, as such, to their couch-sitting audiences. They will always revel in the banality of greatness, and vice versa. But what Sunday’s treatments of the U.S. Olympic team did was to suggest another kind of paradox, and another kind of relatability—one that has as much to do with the athletes’ gender as with their athleticism. This may be the age of women’s empowerment, the age of Serena Williams and Gabby Douglas and Simone Biles and Hillary Clinton; it is also, though, the age of Donald Trump and the wage gap and the tampon tax and the Bic for Her Fashion Retractable Ball Pen, manufactured in a lady-friendly pink. It is also the age that found the Chicago Tribune, on Sunday, announcing the fact that Corey Cogdell-Unrein had medaled for the U.S. in trap-shooting with the tweet, “Wife of a Bears’ lineman wins a bronze medal today in Rio Olympics.” So the political message of women’s gymnastics is on the one hand what the political message of any women’s sports will eventually be: It separates achievement, casually but also meaningfully, from aesthetics. Sports don’t care what a woman looks like, or whether she’s graceful, or whether she’s pleasing to anyone. They care only how high she jumped, how quickly she ran, how many goals she scored. And yet gymnastics comes with particular caveats about looks and behavior and “grace.” It carries standards, both stipulated and unspoken, about one’s comportment. It enforces, for all the strength it demands of its athletes, a certain daintiness. Its competitors, the sport seems to believe—no matter what else they achieve—had better look good while doing their achieving. In that sense gymnastics is, for better or for worse, much more in line than other sports are with the challenges that gravity-bound women face every day. An Under Armour ad that went viral in the lead-up to the Rio Games showed Madison Kocian training, with other women gymnasts, for her Olympics debut. The ad featured inspiring music. It featured the brand’s tagline of of-the-moment empowerment: “Rule yourself.” It featured scenes of the gymnast who is currently one of the best in the world sacrificing, striving, hurting, pushing … and getting her nails done.

President-Elect Donald Trump on Wednesday said he will nominate the Michigan philanthropist and prominent Republican donor Betsy DeVos to be U.S. Education Secretary. The announcement signals that big changes could be on the way for schools and students around the country. Here are five things to know: 1. DeVos will push for school choice DeVos has been a vocal supporter of school choice, which is something Trump backed on the campaign trail. DeVos, who heads up the pro-charter and pro-school-voucher nonprofit American Federation for Children, has said parents should have the ability to choose the best schools for their children, whether they are traditional public schools, charters, or private schools. Trump has proposed creating a $20 billion federal voucher program for families to use to send their kids to the school of their choice. But, as Education Week noted recently, making that program a reality could be difficult. It’s unclear exactly where the funding would come from, and even if Congress did manage to pass such a proposal, some states currently prohibit funds from going to schools with religious affiliations, which could complicate how those funds are used.

Spencer saluted more than 200 attendees on Saturday, gathered at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., for the annual conference of the National Policy Institute, which describes itself as “an independent organization dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of  people of European descent in the United States, and around the world.” Spencer has popularized the term “alt-right” to describe the movement he leads. Spencer has said his dream is “a new society, an ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all Europeans,” and has called for “peaceful ethnic cleansing.” For most of the day, a parade of speakers discussed their ideology in relatively anodyne terms, putting a presentable face on their agenda. But after dinner, when most journalists had already departed, Spencer rose and delivered a speech to his followers dripping with anti-Semitism, and leaving no doubt as to what he actually seeks. He referred to the mainstream media as “Lügenpresse,” a term he said he was borrowing from “the original German”; the Nazis used the word to attack their critics in the press.

Americans talk about democracy like it’s sacred. In public discourse, the more democratic American government is, the better. The people are supposed to rule. But that’s not the premise that underlies America’s political system. Most of the men who founded the United States feared unfettered majority rule. James Madison wrote in Federalist 10 that systems of government based upon “pure democracy … have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property.” John Adams wrote in 1814 that, “Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself.” The framers constructed a system that had democratic features. The people had a voice. They could, for instance, directly elect members of the House of Representatives. But the founders also self-consciously limited the people’s voice.

But we also use it when we’re all alone; it shapes even our silent relationships with ourselves. In his book, The Voices Within, Charles Fernyhough gives a historical overview of “inner speech”—the more scientific term for “talking to yourself in your head.” Fernyhough, a professor at Durham University in the U.K., says that inner speech develops alongside social speech. This idea was pioneered by Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist who studied children in the 1920s and noted that when they learned to talk to other humans, they also learned how to talk to themselves, first out loud, and eventually, in their heads. Continue Reading Yamada Taro / Getty What’s So Great About American World Leadership? Hugh White The U.S. voters who rejected decades of bipartisan foreign-policy consensus might be on to something. How has America come to elect a president who so starkly repudiated decades’ worth of the largely bipartisan vision of U.S. global leadership? And if that vision won’t be the basis of American foreign policy in the 21st century, what will replace it? The big message of 2016 is that large numbers of American voters, Democrat and Republican, do not buy what their political leaders have been selling for so long, and that includes foreign policy. The evidence of this from Trump’s victory is reinforced by Senator Bernie Sanders’ remarkable showing in the Democratic primaries, and by years’ worth of public-opinion surveys showing the widespread view that the United States “does too much in helping solve world problems.” It is also reinforced by the high poll numbers of an outgoing president who has mounted his own quiet campaign against key elements of Washington’s foreign-policy orthodoxy.

In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up).

Trump. Estimates of Trump’s wealth vary substantially: While he self-reports a net worth of $10 billion, independent agencies have arrived at valuation generally between $3 billion and $5 billion. The unprecedented nature of Trump’s business interests, coupled with the many precedents that Trump broke throughout his campaign—not releasing his tax returns, for example, which severely limits attempts to understand his financial situation—has provoked speculation that his presidency may bring about equally unprecedented opportunities for conflicts of interest. Trump’s response—provided on Twitter—only reinforces concerns that he will make little effort to avoid entangling his business and personal interests, and will instead attack those who point that out. Continue Reading sketchblog/flickr Masters of Love Emily Esfahani Smith Science says lasting relationships come down to—you guessed it—kindness and generosity. Every day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 American couples will say “I do,” committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth. Except, of course, it doesn’t work out that way for most people. The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy marriages, as psychologist Ty Tashiro points out in his book The Science of Happily Ever After, which was published earlier this year. Social scientists first started studying marriages by observing them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: Married couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as Tolstoy claimed, or did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common?

Here’s why the race between Governor Pat McCrory and Democrat Roy Cooper isn’t over yet. DURHAM, N.C.—It’s been two weeks since Election Day, which means that in 49 states, residents know who their governor will be next year. North Carolinians, however, are still waiting to see. At the end of balloting on November 8, Democrat Roy Cooper, the current state attorney general, had a lead of a few thousand votes over Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican. Cooper promptly declared victory, but McCrory has not conceded the race, and the state has not been able to declare a winner. On Monday, Cooper announced a transition team, while McCrory accused him of “circumventing the electoral process.” Cooper’s lead fluctuated throughout the day on Tuesday as more counties returned their final canvass, but as of writing it was a little more than 6,000 votes out of roughly 4,700,000.

CBA one of the most 'underowned' stocks in the world The most under-owned ASX stocks. The most over-owned ASX stocks. Professional fund managers are underweight the major banks. Photo: Warren Hackshall Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Commonwealth Bank of Australia is the most under-owned stock on the ASX and the sixth most underweighted stock in the world. That data comes from UBS, which looked at the "most crowded trades" on the world's major bourses, or, in other words, which stocks fund managers, in aggregate, were most over- or underexposed to relative to the weighting of that name within its benchmark index. By this measure, Apple is the most underweighted stock in the world right now. "We sum up all the holdings in dollar value across all the active managers and calculate the weights of stocks in this active trading portfolio," the broker explained in a note to clients. "We then compare this weight with the relevant equity index benchmark to form the active weight." Our first chart shows that professional stock pickers are wary of the big banks in general, as well as BHP, supermarket owners Woolworths and Wesfarmers, Aurizon, AGL and AMP. Eight of those 10 names are in the ASX's top 20 stocks by market capitalisation, reflecting the fact that many professional stock pickers are looking to invest more money outside the blue-chip names, including a general uneasiness with the challenges facing the major lenders, despite the generous dividends on offer. The global top 10 in order from most to least underweight are: Apple, Exxon, AT&T, GE, Toyota, CBA, Nestle, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, and IBM. Analysis by Bank of America-Merrill Lynch suggested a contrarian approach to these so-called "crowded trades" has proved profitable in recent years. "The top 10 most overbought stocks have trailed the S&P for each of the past three years, while the top 10 'most neglected' stocks outperformed the S&P on average by 11.6 per cent," they wrote last month. At the other end of the scale is gold miner Newcrest, which earns the mantle of the most overbought stock on the ASX. Gold has outperformed just about every asset class this year, with the US dollar price of an ounce jumping 25 per cent in 2016 amid dwindling odds of an imminent US Fed rate hike and fresh monetary easing from most of the world's biggest central banks. Most overbought ASX stocks The most overbought stocks on the ASX look a pretty defensive, dividend-focused list, with Telstra the second most overweighted name, alongside a clutch of listed property trusts: Scentre Group, Westfield, Dexus and Vicinity Centres. Sydney Airport is in there, but not fellow infrastructure darling Transurban. Also are three global, industrial names – perhaps as investors bet on either a weaker Aussie dollar and/or improving global growth. These include Amcor, Brambles and James Hardie. Globally, the most overbought stocks are (in order): Amazon, United Health, Medtronic, Microsoft, Amgen, Alphabet, Visa, Texas Instruments, and Comcast.

In a split decision of sorts, a state parole board has denied Dempsey Hawkins, 56, parole in the United States, but said he could be conditionally paroled if he is shipped back to his native England by July, 2018. Hawkins is serving a sentence of 22 years to life for strangling Susan Jacobson to death on May 15, 1976. Hawkins was 16 then. According to the parole board, a final deportation order to the United Kingdom has been issued against Hawkins. A spokeswoman for the state Department of Corrections and Community said Monday that Hawkins remains incarcerated. She could not immediately say if arrangements have been made to deport him. Hawkins had been denied parole on nine prior occasions. In its decision, parole commissioners cited Hawkins'  good disciplinary record and the "numerous rehabilitative achievements," including a college-level education, he's attained while behind bars. But commissioners also found "troubling" Hawkins' "denial and deletion of, or failure to recall certain facts" about the crime during a recent interview three weeks ago. "In short, you still seem capable of deception regarding criminal thoughts and behavior. We find your deceit and actions in support of your deception to be aggravating factors," the board wrote. "Your actions exhibit a cruel deliberation and contempt that prompt us to find that your release in the United States would deprecate the seriousness of the crime as to undermine respect for the law," said the board. Still, commissioners said Hawkins has remained behind bars nearly 16 years beyond his minimum 22-year sentence and granted him conditional parole for deportation only. If deported, Hawkins is not to contact Ms. Jacobson's family and can't financially profit by telling his story. Janice Blanchard, a sister of the victim, said her family is not aware of the complete details of the parole board's ruling, and did not wish to comment on it. In a brief interview in April, Blanchard said Hawkins had shown no remorse for the crime. "Everyone deserves a second chance at life, but not when you don't own up to your mistakes,'' she said then, after a state appellate court ordered the parole board to consider Hawkins' age at the time of the murder.  In ordering a new hearing on the parole board's 2014 denial, the appellate court said the Eighth Amendment requires a juvenile offender's youth and "its attendant characteristics," be weighed by parole commissioners. Commissioners must consider whether the crime reflects, "transient immaturity." Hawkins' civil lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment. Prosecutors said Hawkins killed Ms. Jacobson during a quarrel in which she sought to end their relationship. Hawkins then hid her body in a 55-gallon oil barrel inside an underground bunker at the former Downey's Shipyard in Mariners Harbor. Ms. Jacobson's grieving family, whom Hawkins pretended to aid, searched relentlessly for her body for months. They even sought a nationally-known psychic's help. But her decomposed corpse wasn't recovered for nearly two years — and then, by chance. Three boys came across Ms. Jacobson's skeletal remains on March 25, 1978, as they were exploring in the area. A Feb. 21, 1979, Advance story described the site as a "bleak, desolate area," off Richmond Terrace, between Holland and Western avenues, near the former Procter & Gamble Co. plant. Neighborhood residents referred to the area as "Down-back." Afterward, Hawkins, a native of England, was arrested in Joppa, Ill. He had gone there in April, 1977, to live with his father, Advance records show. Prosecutors' star witness during the trial was Hawkins' cousin, Willie (Puckie) Hawkins. Willie Hawkins testified that his cousin, Dempsey, admitted to choking Ms. Jacobson to death with a shirt. At a re-hearing in June, in which the board reaffirmed its 2014 denial, Hawkins expressed regret for his actions and vowed to lead a crime-free life if released, according to a transcript. "I am remorseful for the crime," he said. "I am deeply, I'm terribly sorry. I wish I had never committed that crime . . . I will never in my life commit another crime. I will never harm another human being, and I mean that." Hawkins said he had been in touch with a vice consul in the United Kingdom, as well as a criminal justice organization there which could assist him with housing, employment and other services. He also said he could stay with relatives living outside of London. Despite the denial, Hawkins was eligible in July for another hearing for the year 2016. Inmates serving indeterminate sentences can apply for parole every two years. If Hawkins is not deported by July, 2018, he can reapply for parole then, the board said.

A bonus issue from the Fortune 500 company is also likely. While IOC itself seems to be in favour of a 1: 2 bonus, the Government, which would be the main beneficiary of the move, may insist on a 1: 1 declaration in view of the company's Rs. 7,486-crore reserve position. While sources say that earlier this fiscal IOC had submitted a detailed plan proposing a 1: 2 bonus, company officials are only willing to confirm that the issue is under active consideration and may materialise. FIPC set up with Vaghul at helm In a bid to garner and absorb at least $10 billions in foreign direct investment (FDI) each year as enunciated by the United Front in its common minimum programme (CMP), the Union Government has constituted the Foreign Investment Promotion Council (FIPC) under the chairmanship of Mr. N. Vaghul, Chairman of Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI), to undertake vigorous investment promotion and marketing activities. Assisting him in this task, as members of the Council, will be Mr. Ashok Ganguly, former Chairman of Hindustan Lever, Mr. Gurcharan Das, former chief of Proctor & Gamble, along with the Presidents of the three apex chambers, namely, the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Assochajn), the Confederation of Indian Industry (Cll) and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI). HC quashes MSE membership selection process The Madras High Court has quashed the membership selection process of the Madras Stock Exchange (MSE) and declared the present selection list as void. The selection process began in 1994. In an order today, Mr. Justice J. Kanagaraj, said the Authorised Assistants should be given preference in granting membership as stated in the bye-laws of the MSE, according to the Exchange officials. The Court said the increase in the number of fresh members to be admitted for 1994, from 50 to 60, was also inadmissible. The initial plan was to give membership to 200 applicants in four years and about 50 every year.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive One of the biggest threats to the Rio Olympics will come from the internet Saturday Aug 6, 2016 at 3:33 PM Christopher Woody The Brazilian government plans to flood the streets of Rio de Janeiro with 85,000 armed soldiers and police to ensure security on the ground during the Olympic Games. But several reports and analysis from experts indicate that one of the biggest threats to visitors will come from the internet. An August 2 report from cybersecurity firm Fortinet, first spotted by Insight Crime, found that the "volume of malicious and phishing artifacts (i.e. domain names and URLs) in Brazil is on the rise." The country saw an 83% increase in malicious URLs, compared to just 16% growth for the rest of the world, the report found. Worldwide phishing activity was also up, with a 76% spike from April to June, Fortinet reported. "Additional email phishing takeaways include increased activity from Tokelau with the top four country code domains in Q2 2016 being Brazil, Columbia, Russia and India." According to a report from Kaspersky Lab, Brazil sustained the most attacks from phishing attempts, with workers at the games being targeted for their credentials. "In February we identified a very interesting targeted campaign, on our domain monitoring system, against the IOC using the malicious domain masquerade as their Intranet portal," Kaspersky's report said. "The purpose of the attackers was to steal credentials of IOC employees working in Brazil." Kaspersky researchers also said that tests on the ground in Brazil "showed roughly one in four wireless internet access points likely to be used by tourists were highly vulnerable to cyber attacks," Insight Crime noted. "There's certainly sophisticated criminals that can clearly propagate" identity theft and compromise credit cards, Jim Hutton, chief security officer at On Call International and former director of global security for Proctor and Gamble, told Business Insider prior to the games, which run from August 5 to August 21. "If companies are traveling, especially sponsor companies," Hutton added, "they might be traveling with proprietary information about marketing plans or customer rollouts, as part of their hospitality program. That could all be at risk too." Bill Evanina, a top US counterintelligence official, told USA Today in June that events like the games are a "great playground"’ for government intelligence services and criminals because of the "sheer number of devices." This kind of activity won't be new to Brazil. The US State Department's Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) reports that annual losses related to cybersecurity and online fraud in Brazil reach billions of dollars, and, as Insight Crime notes, these illicit activities have grown more sophisticated in recent years. "Brazil continues to rank as one of the most pervasive cybercrime environments worldwide," the OSAC said earlier this year. "Brazilian cybercriminals have grown more brazen, stealing billions of dollars annually despite new legislation and official efforts to stop malicious activity online." Recent reports indicate that online criminal groups from other parts of the world are trying to link up with cyber criminals in Brazil, and with as many as 500,000 visitors expected to flood Brazil for the games, they may have plenty of targets.

More crying! More bees! How to breathe new life into hit TV MasterChef, The Apprentice and Bake Off all look a bit stale. We can fix that Replace Mary Berry with Katie Price! Photograph: BBC/Love Productions Stuart Heritage @stuheritage Monday 8 August 2016 08.00 EDT Last modified on Monday 8 August 2016 08.01 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close When a television series has been around for a while, it faces a choice. Does it carry on, ploughing the same old trench over and over again without deviation until viewers get bored and stop watching? Or does it attempt a high-risk format tweak? Sometimes that can be a good thing (The Voice became much better when it cut back on live shows), and sometimes it backfires completely (The X Factor six-chair challenge is basically bear-baiting with glitter). But it’s often necessary. British TV is full of hoary old veterans in danger of dying of irrelevance, so here are the fixes that will rejuvenate them. MasterChef Facebook Twitter Pinterest Bring back the Passion Test, an un-British sensation... Photograph: BBC/Shine TV A change doesn’t always have to a new innovation – sometimes it can simply be the return of an old favourite. Think how much better MasterChef would be if they brought back the old Passion Test, which was a real thing where the contestants had to sit in front of Gregg and John and demonstrate their love of cooking by shouting or wailing about their dead relatives in such an un-British demonstration of abject hysteria that it made your genitals shrink to a microdot. God, I miss the Passion Test. Dragons’ Den Facebook Twitter Pinterest Send in the clones… Photograph: BBC Change is already afoot on the long-running BBC Two series, with Theo Paphitis being replaced by a man who looks identical to Theo Paphitis. This should continue. From now on, all the Dragons should have a legion of exact physical lookalikes in the wings, and inventors can only get their money if they first fight their way down a corridor of furious Deborah Meaden clones. Too much? Then let’s mix things up next time by hiring a Dragon who isn’t an almighty swaggering berk who dresses like an estate agent and doesn’t derive a weird sexual kick from exploiting or rejecting the desperate at their most vulnerable. The Great British Bake Off There’s more than a fighting chance that our beloved Bake Off will move to ITV next year. If that’s the case, these changes are all but guaranteed: 1) Mel and Sue will be replaced by Carol Vorderman. 2) Mary Berry will be replaced by Katie Price. 3) Paul Hollywood will get to judge the show in skintight racing leathers, and give sympathetic scores to any bake that can be crushed down and used as a makeshift talcum powder. 4) There’ll be a live studio audience that repeatedly tries and fails to clap along with the theme tune. 5) Thanks to an ongoing channel-wide product placement deal with Procter & Gamble, every showstopper bake will include Daz as a primary ingredient. Countdown Facebook Twitter Pinterest Pelt the contestants with bees! Photograph: Channel 4 After 33 years on air, Countdown is as concrete a format as you can get. Nothing major should be changed here, although I would recommend either shocking the studio audience with electricity so they look a bit more lively – or sporadically pelting the contestants with bees during the numbers round. Watchdog The signature sequence of Watchdog is when a presenter visits the office of a fraudulent CEO and shouts questions at them until they get in their car and drive off. As fun as this is, it’s far too short. How about getting the presenter to follow the CEO into their car and punch them in the face while they try to drive, then dress up as their wife and seduce them until their entire life becomes a waking nightmare of confusion and suspicion and they have no choice but to refund an old lady £25 for her faulty guttering. The Apprentice Facebook Twitter Pinterest Get on the go-karts now! Photograph: Jim Marks/BBC/PA Now 11 years old, The Apprentice has long since shed any notion that it’s about clever people looking for a great job. It’s now so transparently about self-interested dimwits extravagantly mucking up basic tasks that the BBC should just bite the bullet and give the people what they want. Why not kidnap the candidates, inject them with a powerful hallucinogen and drop them inside a revolving hall of mirrors full of warped fairground music and crying children, then leave them there till they can adequately construct an Ikea Billy bookcase, at which point Alan Sugar will appear and let them drive go-karts for the afternoon? You’d watch that, right?

The presence of untapped market for diapers and emergence of hybrid diapers are laying growth opportunities for the market, during the forecast period. Explore Report with Detailed TOC at: https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/diapers-market The delayed toilet training of children in developed countries and growing online purchase of baby diapers are the two trends witnessed in the global diaper market. The age at which toddlers become diaper free is increasing, since the past few years. In 1957, approximately 92% of children were toilet trained till 18 months of age, as compared to 2015 in which only 65% of children were reported to be toilet trained till the age of 36 months. As the per capita income of consumers in the developing countries (such as the U.S.) is more, as compared to those in the developing countries; it is easy for the people of developed countries to afford expensive diapers for their children. This trend is expected to influence the revenue of the global baby diaper market during the forecast period. Request for Report Sample: https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/diapers-... Due to the massive growth of population in developing countries, the use of diapers is also increasing. As the per capita income of consumers is increasing, the consumers are focusing more on personal and baby hygiene. Good hygiene is an important barrier to many infectious diseases, including the fecal–oral diseases, and it promotes better health and well-being. To achieve the greatest health benefits, people are focusing more on improvement in hygiene. The modern baby diapers and incontinence products have a layered construction, which allows the distribution and transfer of urine to a penetrable core structure, where it is locked. Diapers provide hygiene, cleanliness, comfort, and independence to the babies and adults. Though diapers are helpful in maintaining the personal hygiene of babies and adults, they are very unnatural in many ways. This has led to the increasing demand for diapers made from natural raw-materials. The global baby diaper market is driven by the manufacturers involved in introducing baby diapers that have better breathability, are soft, and cause fewer rashes on the baby's skin.

The declining birth rate in developed countries is the key factor restraining the growth of the baby diaper segment of the market. The major companies operating in the global baby diaper market include Kimberly-Clark Corporation, Procter & Gamble, Unicharm Corporation, Kao Corporation, SVENSKA CELLULOSA AKTIEBOLAGET SCA, Bumkins, Fujian Heng Group Co.

(Photo: The Enquirer/Carrie Cochran)Buy Photo ERLANGER – L'Oreal plans to build the largest solar energy installation by a private company in Kentucky at its Florence manufacturing plant, local company officials said Tuesday. And given the prevalence and importance of coal mining in the Bluegrass State, the venture is bold. "The value of sustainability, from a L'Oreal standpoint, is non-negotiable," said Eric Wolff, vice president of the beauty company's manufacturing operations. Wolff said the project, where contract negotiations are still ongoing, is the biggest undertaking of its type in the company's history. The Florence plant is one of several manufacturing operations the France-based maker of cosmetics, skincare, and haircare products has in the United States. Wolff and representatives from Mazak Corp., Balluff Inc. and Celanese Corp. joined in a discussion Tuesday to talk about the future of manufacturing in the region. The discussion was part of the Northern Kentucky Chamber of Commerce's Eggs 'N Issues breakfast event. In Boone, Kenton and Campbell counties, more than 20,000 workers are involved in manufacturing, which accounts for about 58 percent of the region's total workforce, according to Daniel Tobergte, president and CEO of Northern Kentucky Tri-County Economic Development Corp. In the past five years, the region has seen 74 companies expand or relocate here, accounting for $950 million in capital investments, Tobergte said. Average manufacturing salaries tend to be higher than non-manufacturing jobs: $59,500 annually for manufacturing versus $44,500 annually for all other jobs. Here are some of the issues that the manufacturing executives said are faced by their companies: Sustainability  L'Oreal has developed a company-wide plan to reduce its carbon footprint by 60 percent by 2020. About six months after the solar panel installation is complete, the company will be able to generate 1.5 megawatts of electricity annually to power its plant "It will require a significant amount of work on our part," Wolff said. "We are committed to reducing" our impact on the environment. Keeping up with technology After Mazak completed a $30 million expansion project, which included adding $19 million of new equipment, company leaders found that new and older technologies "speak different languages," said Ben Schawe, vice president of manufacturing. "Our challenge now is communication between the equipment," he said. The company has started to collaborate with tech firm Cisco Systems to prevent hackers from infiltrating Mazak's equipment, as well as implementing new ways to get equipment to "speak to each other." Working against lower energy prices As energy prices have dipped over the last few years, Chuck Thomas, site manager at chemicals company Celanese, said capital projects have been put on hold. "Our period for cost-reduction projects has extended," Thomas said. "The cost of everything has decreased and that is a challenge for us now." Finding a skilled workforce "Manufacturing is considered a dirty word to some people," said Thomas, adding that perceptions of the industry are largely what keep people from pursuing jobs in manufacturing. "That's contrary today to what manufacturing really is – it's not an office environment and it's not easy. But it's a field where employers make sure workers are safe and successful." Getting young people interested in manufacturing is not easy, Schawe said. Part of the problem is getting parents to encourage their children to enter the field, he said. Mazak is combating the issue by working with area schools and inviting parents on the weekends to its shop floor. Fighting new competition With Procter & Gamble's high-profile brand-shedding efforts in the beauty sector, :L'Oreal's Wolff said "we're a shark in the ocean surrounded by piranhas." He said the company's new competition is retailer Amazon, which is "changing our world and every competitor we have is highly competitive and reactive to the market." 8 CONNECTTWEET 16 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2bd3MUH TOP VIDEOS Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 22 17:46 Joe Deters asks for retrial of Ray Tensing, seeks change of venue 3:07 Black Friday secrets the stores don't want you to know 1:01 Finding home: A 12-year-old boy's search in the midst of war 6:41 Bills-Bengals postgame wrap 3:10 Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 Use-of-force expert: 'The actions of Ray Tensing were justified' 0:50 Which stores are opening, closing Thanksgiving Day 0:34 \u0022I can't wait to see Tensing on the stand\u0022 0:55 Cincinnati Police Criminalist: Tensing 'seemed nervous or afraid' 2:59 Jobs Report FedEx is set to hire 500 workers in Greater Cincinnati for the holidays Fatima Hussein Ohio, Ky. and other states challenge US on OT rule Fatima Hussein Cincinnati region's jobless rate steady in August Fatima Hussein Ohio unemployment rate rises as state loses jobs Fatima Hussein Kentucky employment dips slightly in August Fatima Hussein Burger King, Popeyes franchisee hiring 500 workers Fatima Hussein This story is part of Jobs Report FedEx is set to hire 500 workers in Greater Cincinnati for the holidays Ohio, Ky. and other states challenge US on OT rule Cincinnati region's jobless rate steady in August
