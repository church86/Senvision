Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Oct 30, 2016 at 3:31PM Walk down the aisles of your local grocery store or big box retailer, and you are faced with a sometimes overwhelming selection of thousands of products. But even then, that is only a small subset of the more than one million items available to consumers each year. In this Industry Focus: Consumer Goods segment, the cast considers the challenges of competing in an environment with seemingly limitless consumer options and what that implies for consumer staples manufacturers like Unilever and Procter & Gamble. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 12, 2016. Vincent Shen: I really wanted to hammer the point home in terms of how important these efforts can be for companies by stepping back a little bit and giving a little bit of a big picture context and calling out some numbers that I think can put things into perspective. For example, in 2008 research from the Food Marketing Institute the typical U.S. grocery store, or supermarket, stocked about 47,000 different products. That is up 50% from the previous decade and about five-fold since 1975. Keep in mind that a Wal-Mart Supercenter, for example, their SKU numbers for a store that size is well over 100,000. And then if you go a step further, researching the case at any one time in the United States, there are at least one million products on the market for consumers to purchase. So that research might be a few years old now, so with some of the other trends that we've seen, you can imagine that number is likely much larger than one million at this point with customization, for example. So the sobering reality I think for a lot of retailers, be it Unilever or Procter & Gamble, is that consumers only use about 340 unique items in a year out of that one million-plus. And making sure that you are maximizing your profitability, maximizing your product mix and what is on store shelves, to boost your revenue and make sure that that small subset of items that each consumer uses includes products from your portfolio, is just really important. Is there any other thoughts that you wanted to leave our listeners with, Asit? Asit Sharma: Just one last thought. And by the way, those are some mind-boggling statistics and I think that really visually gives us an idea of how much supply there is out there of product and why it's a great idea to reduce as much as you can if you're a manufacturer. My last point is that we see the Pareto Principle in life a lot, which is 80% of outputs are due to 20% of inputs. See that in so many different spheres of life, and manufacturers have found this to be very true ... SKU and brand rationalization, that a lot of times it's just a few products that are really driving your sales and your profits, so why wouldn't you put in the effort to pare those down and optimize your profit and optimize your cash flow? As investors, we should be looking for the companies which are actively trying to perform this exercise. And the two companies we've mentioned today are really into this. Their management talks about these concepts almost every conference call, we see it in the numbers, and it's a great way to evaluate a consumer goods company. Are they paying attention to the proliferation of products that they've got, and are they trying to make themselves more efficient as time goes on?

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Oct 29, 2016 at 4:05PM In this Industry Focus: Consumer Goods segment, the team discusses how Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is taking the concept of SKU rationalization to an even deeper level with "brand rationalization". Management has shed dozens of brands from the P&G portfolio in an effort to revitalize the business, and there are some key metrics investors can watch to follow the company's progress. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 12, 2016. Vincent Shen: I wanted to make sure we got to Procter & Gamble because they have been taking, I think, this whole process and reducing and optimizing their offerings to a whole other level with the amount of brands they have dropped recently and how they're trying to refocus their resources, their money, into basically what they see as the most profitable brand portfolio that they can possibly target. Asit Sharma: Absolutely. If you take the concept of SKU rationalization and blow it up, there's a term for it. It's called brand rationalization. And that's what Procter & Gamble is up to. They also have been talking up their effort to reduce SKU count over the past several years. But a couple of years ago they woke up one day and realized, we have way too many brands in our portfolio. So, over the last 18 months, Procter & Gamble has exited, or consolidated, 61 of their brands and it's in the process of exiting 44 more by the end of this year. Again, going back to what we found in Unilever's case study, the brands that Procter & Gamble is getting rid of represented only 6% of profit during those 18 months. And when this whole process is completed, Procter & Gamble is going to be left with only 65 brands across 10 major categories. Shen: So let me hop in there really quick. One thing I wanted to make sure we touched on for listeners was also just previously, over the summer, we'd done a show that's somewhat related to this, was around inventory turnover, inventory management, and there's a point here, a metric here, for Procter & Gamble that really stands out to kind of show how this brand rationalization that you mentioned has benefited them. So let's touch on that, and then also I'd love if there are any other metrics. I know there's nothing that is one-to-one necessarily with SKU management and with reduction that investors can look at, but what other metrics can investors use when trying to evaluate a company's effort in this space? Sharma: Sure. Well, you've touched on a really great one. This is a metric that you can find on many financial websites, but if you look at days of inventory outstanding. When you hear that a big company is trying to become more efficient with its product lines, there's a way you can see if they're being effective or not. Procter & Gamble before this effort, the other day, had a days inventory outstanding of 78 days. What that means is that it takes Procter & Gamble about 78 days to cycle its inventory on average and it replaces its inventory about 78 days, if you average everything out. Through this process, P&G now has a days inventory outstanding of 58 days, and that's a very solid boost to cash flow because inventory is cash tied up. You have to build a product, you have to move it, you have to store it, to get into a store, and then you get paid and collect the cash. So this is an excellent metric to see if a company is walking the walk. And we can tell in this case that P&G is certainly walking the walk. Some other metrics you can look at include the cash conversion cycle, which, again, is maybe effective to look at but might be more difficult to find. But if you want one which is easy enough to locate, look at a company's operating cash flow. Procter & Gamble again is sacrificing some top-line sales in order to trim its brands. That means some brands will disappear; it won't be selling those on the marketplace. But if you look every quarter going forward at the amount of operating cash flow Procter & Gamble generates, if it's being successful, that number is going to grow every quarter here on out. I love to look at that when I know companies are trying to become more efficient with their resources. And these two concepts are tied together. The company cycles its inventory more quickly, it should produce more operating cash flow. And so far what we're seeing is it's a good thing that Procter & Gamble has undertaken this initiative so long-suffering investors have seen that stock for many years just remain stagnant. It's finally, I think, getting a little bit of lift from these operational efforts. Asit Sharma has no position in any stocks mentioned. Vincent Shen has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Even when great ideas come up from the lowest of the hierarchical ladder, it is rarely delivered to the very top. The leadership shouts for innovation, but it often does not realize that innovation is within arm's reach. Letting ideas flow freely within an organization ― the open innovation platform ― is a critical factor in driving creative success for a company. "It's not okay from the CEO's perspective to say to that bright young person you just hired, 'if you have an idea, you have to sell the idea to your boss, your boss' boss and your boss' boss' boss before it has a chance of being implemented,'" said Tom Kelley, partner at IDEO, the world's first and largest design thinking consultancy which started off in Palo Alto, California. "Some people you hire for their deep technical excellence, but they don't always have the communication skills to sell the idea to the hierarchy. As an outsider, I don't want to shake up the hierarchy, I want to go to the CEO and say 'Look, you've earned the right to be the boss, to make the hiring decisions, but don't let the hierarchy get in the way of the free flow of ideas,'" he said during an interview with The Korea Times. Kelley was in Seoul to give a speech at Startup:CON (Oct. 11-12), a conference for startups and innovators, organized by the Korea Creative Content Agency (KOCCA). "In all such cultures, you've got to find a way to have that idea float, go up and down the hierarchy, through an open innovation platform inside the company -- whether it be poster-days or internal trade fairs ― or some way that systematically floats ideas up and down. You have to have a way," he said. Tom Kelley speaks during an interview with The Korea Times. / Courtesy of Startup:CON Barriers to innovation The hierarchical structure isn't just confined to Asia. The problem is not much different in the United States, he said. There are always barriers within any organization in the world and so there's a need to get through it, Kelley added. "Especially in hierarchical cultures you need to find some way to cut through the hierarchy with respect to ideas. My experience is, you have the support at the very top. I've never met a CEO who is not pro-innovation. So the support is there. It's just in some organizations, there's the energy at the top among visionaries and there's the energy among young new members of the team who want to change the world ― it only gets stuck in the middle." Cultural barriers to innovation are also not confined to a hierarchical system. In large established companies, there's "always the need to get today's work out perfectly," says Kelley. "Sometimes they don't have the time or attention to think of tomorrow. If you're too focused on getting today's work done ― the only job in front of you ― that's a barrier." Design thinking This is where design thinking comes in. Design thinking is a cognitive methodology and activity that helps people to develop creative ways to solve issues. Kelley puts it as "using the tool set or mindset of a designer ― such as designing objects or architecture ― and taking that same process and applying it to bigger issues such as designing a school system, designing new ways to interact with health services or rural villages to get better access to clean water." Simply put, it is "using the tool set or mindset of a designer for broader topics." Kelly says the three key tools for design thinking are empathy, experimentation and storytelling. "If you're a tech company, you need to blend technology with humanity. You need to bring your strengths to the table. Then the heart of the experiment must be that we're the kind of team that tries stuff. We will fail but we will still try stuff. You need to prototype. Finally, even with the best idea in the world, if you can't get other people to adopt it, it's not going to change anything. You need to take that concept and wrap it in a good story." IDEO, which his brother David Kelley founded and Tom Kelley is a partner at, is a company that has pioneered in design thinking for the past 30 years, creating human-centered products, services and spaces, and helping organizations innovate by empowering the people who drive them. Changing the culture What they have seen from the example of P&G, their most memorable client which saw success from applying design thinking to their company, was that the role of a middle manager or those with significant authority who were able to "pick up the ball" was crucial in initiating creative projects. "We collectively changed the culture of P&G during that era. It included support from the top, but that's not enough. Claudia (Kotchka), a leader with a big personality, a lot of stamina, and with permission from the CEO, systematically drove design thinking within P&G. She was vice president for design innovation and strategy and had the respect which went with her high position but she didn't have direct authority with anyone she worked with. She had to convince them using the power of her arguments over the power of authority," Kelley said. "The same thing happened with Kaaren (Hanson), vice president of design innovation at Intuit. Top support was not enough. The executives said they'll do it but didn't come back and went on with their daily jobs. Nothing happened. So she picked up the ball. She created a program called Catalyst with nine people. They needed a series of successes. You need to point to a success or two for the skeptics. If you get to the successes, then you have entry proof to say 'Here's a situation where design thinking won the day,' as soon as people see that, they'll say 'yes I want some.'" Kelley says the P&G model is replicable. "Anybody with the right support and right energy can do that," he said. "It really changed P&G ― we saw it in their stock price, product introduction, and passion of individuals. They designed hands on experiences with design thinking, and realized this stuff actually worked. It wasn't persuading them but demonstrating for them. It was a different lens to look at their business. Even among the skeptics, when the early successes come out, they'd say, 'I want some of that. Get that for my division.'" However, success is not always measured as a number, he says. "A clear understanding of what success looks or feels like can be useful. There's not an obvious metric." Creative confidence Kelley, author of "Creative Confidence" and "The Art of Innovation," was nowhere near the artistic world. He was working in the finance, IT and consulting fields, before joining IDEO to work with his brother. He says working with creative people has transformed him. "You have to be vulnerable enough to be willing to try something you won't necessarily be good at right away and then you've got to be humble to realize how much you can learn," said Kelley. "To be honest, at some point in the early history of IDEO, we had some (employees with) MBAs from very prestigious schools who came in and thought they already knew what they needed to know and had trouble being team players with designers, engineers and anthropologists. We need to take the opposite approach. If you want to achieve creative confidence, you have to first acknowledge that you have something to learn." Being open to possibilities is the step to gaining creative confidence, he said. Newspaper innovation How can design thinking be applied to newspapers? "It's quite a challenge. It's an extremely challenging environment. It's not that a worthy competitor has stolen a bit of market share from us that we could steal back. It's not one core aspect of our business that is demonetized. It's hard to compete against free," he said. "I want to pay for news because I want journalism. Not somebody's opinion. I want somebody who's verified their facts. That is not free and somebody has to pay for it. I'm willing to pay my fair share of that." The newspaper industry has to figure out a way to innovate itself, said Kelley. "How might we sustain really good journalism through the next few decades? Very possibly the answer is not in print form." To view the video clip of the interview, click on the link below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERPDWkuabzM&t=18s ysy@ktimes.com 1.

Awaiting the birth of her third child, she dreaded what she called the “awful labour” of washing, drying and ironing cloth nappies. Surprised there was no alternative, she determined to invent one. The result was a two-part system, the Paddi: an adjustable waterproof outer garment holding a discardable, biodegradable pad, made of cellulose wadding covered over with cotton wool. She received a patent for the invention in October 1949. The first 400 she made at her kitchen table with a Singer sewing machine, selling them to friends for five shillings apiece. Boots began to sell her nappies in all their branches in 1950, after a Lancet article argued disposable nappies helped reduce baby rashes. Seventy-two thousand of them sold in 1950, then, in 1951, 250,000. By 1960, the number was 6m. The American company Procter & Gamble began producing the all-in-one Pampers from 1961, which, though not biodegradable, were cheaper. The Paddi entered a slow decline in sales, the last rolling of the assembly line in 1990. Hunter Gordon’s subsequent inventions included the Nikini, one of the first modern sanitary towels, in 1954, and a house which she continually redesigned to spare household labour. Rather than ironing, she pressed shirts by placing them under the carpet. Tiring of polishing her family’s mahogany table, she made a plastic top, saying “if anybody important comes to stay, we’ll take it off”. It never came off, including during a visit to her house by Margaret Thatcher. Hunter Gordon’s drawing room became a laboratory of invention, with her children Nigel and Frances often roped in to serve as models. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Boots began to sell Valerie Hunter Gordon’s nappies in all their branches in 1950 Daughter of Sir Vincent Ziani de Ferranti, and his wife, Dorothy (nee Wilson), she was born in the Peak District, in the small Derbyshire village of Baslow, into a family of inventors. Her grandfather, Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti, was an Italian-Liverpudlian electrical engineer. Being one of the few experts on alternating-current electricity in Britain, in 1891 he designed the world’s first modern power station, at Deptford, south-east London. Valerie’s father oversaw the expansion of the family business, Ferranti, into a major manufacturer of radios and televisions, involved too in defence electronics and early postwar computing. Valerie was frequently in and out of her grandfather’s house, living nearby until his death in 1930. He worked often at home, and was fond of sharing with his granddaughter how his inventions worked, and his vision of the use of technology and innovation to improve daily lives. “I suspect that is where she learned if you have a need, and it’s not fulfilled, then maybe you could do something about it yourself,” said her son Nigel. “I know that he loved to tell her about all the things he was doing, and she loved to listen to it.” She attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart school, in Roehampton, south-west London, run by a French teaching order of nuns. (After the second world war, the school relocated to the Surrey village of Woldingham, and presently exists as Woldingham school.) In 1940, she married a Scottish major and electrical engineer, Patrick Hunter Gordon. Both her father and husband were involved in the retreat from Dunkirk – her father leading a group home to safety on discarded motorbikes, by way of the Spanish border, arriving home just in time for their wedding. When Patrick left the army in 1950, the family moved to Beauly, 10 miles west of Inverness. He took over a family business, AI Welders and Cable Belts. He suffered from post-traumatic illness, in which she was a constant support; he, in turn, requisitioned surplus parachute nylon for her experiments, helped her test early designs with families of army colleagues, and encouraged her to bring forward the product commercially. Her father also was an unflagging supporter. Hunter Gordon wrote to the nappy-makers Robinsons of Chesterfield, who initially were sceptical due to a failed related experiment in the 1930s. At a Royal Society dinner, her father then found himself seated beside the company’s chairman, Sir Robert Robinson – which resulted in her getting a second hearing and an invitation to Chesterfield. She convinced the company to produce them in bulk, paying her royalties, starting in late 1949. Those familiar with Hunter Gordon describe her as pragmatic and insightful, with a wicked sense of humour and ability to see straight to the nub of a subject. Supremely confident in her own judgment, she was nonetheless personally modest and self-effacing. She said later if she had known the amount of work involved in seeing her invention through, she “would have gone on washing the damned things”. Patrick died in a car accident in 1978. She is survived by their six children, Hugh, Alison, Nigel – the inspiration and model for the original disposable nappy – Frances, Richard and Kit, 19 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren. • Valerie Hunter Gordon, inventor, born 7 December 1921; died 16 October 2016 More obituaries Topics Children Second world war Scotland Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

The NACD fellowship is regarded as the highest standard of credentialing for directors and governance professionals. Siff has acquired and sold hundreds of companies in a variety of industries. Prior to founding Neptune Advisors, he was principal and managing director of Gordon Brothers Group, a $50 billion investment and transaction advisory firm. Over his 30-year career, he has led manufacturing, technology, consumer, wholesale and retail businesses. He began his career at Procter and Gamble, where he created the wholesale club division which today accounts for over $3 billion in sales. Siff currently serves on the board of directors of Kayem Foods Inc. and Mason Companies Inc., and is an industry advisor for Silverwood Partners, a boutique investment bank. He is a trustee of the Museum of Science; chairman of the Asia-America Chamber of Commerce; a director of the Smaller Business Association of New England, Two-Ten International Footwear Foundation and Winsor School Corporation; and a member of the Chief Executives’ Club of Boston. *** The Shrewsbury Education Foundation has announced its annual Community Service Award. Shrewsbury Town Manager and resident Daniel Morgado will join the list of recipients, which includes State Rep. Hannah Kane, R-Shrewsbury; the late Ted Coghlin; Mark Murray; Tom Kennedy; Joseph Sawyer; and Beth Casavant. Morgado will formally receive the award at the foundation's Annual Awards and Recognitions Dinner which will take place on Jan. 21, 2017 at Cyprian Keyes Golf Club in Boylston. Morgado has worked in municipal administrative offices since 1978, first as executive secretary to the Selectmen of Swansea, before first coming the Shrewsbury briefly as an administrative assistant to the long-time town manager Richard Carney. He then served as town administrator in three towns: first Blackstone, then Easton and Grafton. In 1997, he returned to Shrewsbury to succeed Carney as town manager, becoming only the third person holding the job since the position was created in 1953. Morgado holds a Master of Public Administration degree from Clark University, a program in which he now teaches. He is also a member of the Massachusetts Water Resources Management Advisory Committee, the Massachusetts 495/Metro West Suburban Edge Community Commission and the Massachusetts Joint Labor-Management Committee for Municipal Police and Fire. *** Dr. Matthew Wylie, a Southborough resident, has joined the staff of Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge.

He completed his residency in pediatrics at Boston Combined Residency Program, Boston Children’s Hospital and Boston Medical Center. Wylie received training in pediatric critical care medicine at Boston Children’s Hospital and pediatric emergency medicine at Hasbro Children’s Hospital. He also received a Master of Science in clinical and translational research at Brown University. *** Tommy’s Taxi president Jo-Anne Thompson, of Framingham, has been named the 2016 Outstanding Contributor to Women in Transportation by the Taxicab, Limousine and Paratransit Association. Thompson’s father, a World War II veteran, founded Tommy’s Taxi in Framingham in 1946. It has since grown into a regional institution that has twice before been recognized for its work providing accessible transportation to riders with disabilities. Thompson has been president of Tommy’s Taxi since 1999, using her experience in the computer industry to help the company move forward with digital technology. Thompson recently helped raise more than $700,000 to fund a new public library that opened in May, and is involved in several civic organizations, including the Framingham Business Association, the Chamber of Commerce and the Tourism and Visitors Bureau. Thompson, a former English teacher, hopes to assist with further fundraising for a bookmobile this year. Thompson will accept her award in front of more than 1,000 industry professionals at the TLPA’s 98th Annual Convention & Trade Show Nov. 1 at the Hyatt Regency / Phoenix Convention Center in Phoenix.

If AT&T survives regulatory scrutiny without having to divest too many assets, the new AT&T will become the nation’s No. 1 advertiser — leaping past Procter & Gamble, the maker of toilet paper, toothpaste and laundry detergent. The mega-merger is expected to take a year to close. Dallas-based AT&T spent $3.9 billion on US ads in 2015, according to Advertising Age data, more than double the $1.7 billion spent by Time Warner. Together, the combined companies will leap frog over P&G’s $4.3 billion ad spend and into the No. 1 spot with a combined total of roughly $5.6 billion. AT&T ads for its DirecTV unit are currently on the air. The firm’s new product, DirecTV Now, an online cable-like bundle of 100 channels is set to get a marketing push for its Nov. 4 launch. AT&T would become the biggest media owner, leaping over Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, but would sit behind Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook in terms of market capitalization.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Oct 30, 2016 at 3:31PM Walk down the aisles of your local grocery store or big box retailer, and you are faced with a sometimes overwhelming selection of thousands of products. But even then, that is only a small subset of the more than one million items available to consumers each year. In this Industry Focus: Consumer Goods segment, the cast considers the challenges of competing in an environment with seemingly limitless consumer options and what that implies for consumer staples manufacturers like Unilever and Procter & Gamble. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 12, 2016. Vincent Shen: I really wanted to hammer the point home in terms of how important these efforts can be for companies by stepping back a little bit and giving a little bit of a big picture context and calling out some numbers that I think can put things into perspective. For example, in 2008 research from the Food Marketing Institute the typical U.S. grocery store, or supermarket, stocked about 47,000 different products. That is up 50% from the previous decade and about five-fold since 1975. Keep in mind that a Wal-Mart Supercenter, for example, their SKU numbers for a store that size is well over 100,000. And then if you go a step further, researching the case at any one time in the United States, there are at least one million products on the market for consumers to purchase. So that research might be a few years old now, so with some of the other trends that we've seen, you can imagine that number is likely much larger than one million at this point with customization, for example. So the sobering reality I think for a lot of retailers, be it Unilever or Procter & Gamble, is that consumers only use about 340 unique items in a year out of that one million-plus. And making sure that you are maximizing your profitability, maximizing your product mix and what is on store shelves, to boost your revenue and make sure that that small subset of items that each consumer uses includes products from your portfolio, is just really important. Is there any other thoughts that you wanted to leave our listeners with, Asit? Asit Sharma: Just one last thought. And by the way, those are some mind-boggling statistics and I think that really visually gives us an idea of how much supply there is out there of product and why it's a great idea to reduce as much as you can if you're a manufacturer. My last point is that we see the Pareto Principle in life a lot, which is 80% of outputs are due to 20% of inputs. See that in so many different spheres of life, and manufacturers have found this to be very true ... SKU and brand rationalization, that a lot of times it's just a few products that are really driving your sales and your profits, so why wouldn't you put in the effort to pare those down and optimize your profit and optimize your cash flow? As investors, we should be looking for the companies which are actively trying to perform this exercise. And the two companies we've mentioned today are really into this. Their management talks about these concepts almost every conference call, we see it in the numbers, and it's a great way to evaluate a consumer goods company. Are they paying attention to the proliferation of products that they've got, and are they trying to make themselves more efficient as time goes on? Asit Sharma has no position in any stocks mentioned. Vincent Shen has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool recommends Procter & Gamble and Unilever.

United Way shifts funds in child poverty fight The Enquirer 4:10 p.m. EDT October 29, 2016 Buy Photo Julia Poston, 2015 Enquirer Women of the Year honoree, is the incoming chair of the United Way. (Photo: The Enquirer/Madison Schmidt)Buy Photo United Way of Greater Cincinnati will "redirect millions of dollars" in the effort to reduce child poverty in the city by 10,000 children or 5,000 families over the next five years, officials said Saturday. The shift could help curb Cincinnati's high child poverty rate – it ranks sixth highest among U.S. cities with populations of 300,000 to 600,000 in that indicator – but it could also mean that groups that traditionally have been recipients of United Way funds will see cuts. The incoming chair of the United Way, Julia Poston, said the funding agency was keeping its goal of boosting the region's education, income and health. But Poston told more than 700 people gathered for a Child Poverty Collaborative forum that the agency's board this week decided that progress in improving those areas had been "too incremental and too isolated." The idea is that a more targeted effort focusing on children and their families would do more good. "We're in this for the long haul," Poston told the gathering at Downtown's Duke Energy Convention Center. Details of the shift, which will occur over the next year, remain to be worked out, Poston said in a brief interview after the event concluded. United Way will be looking for "fundamental changes in social services" so they are more integrated to assist poor families, she said. Currently, "there's nobody to help them access all" that's available. Roughly half of $51 million that the funding agency gave out in 2015 went to groups or programs fighting poverty, said Poston, managing partner for the accounting firm Ernst & Young's Cincinnati's office. In 2011, United Way set six "bold goals" it had hoped to reach by 2020: In education, having 85 percent of children prepared for kindergarten; 85 percent of youths graduating from high school and prepared for the next step; and 45 percent of adults with an associate's degree or higher. In income, having 90 percent of the labor force gainfully employed. In health, having 95 percent of the community with a usual and appropriate place to go for health care; and 70 percent of the community having excellent or very good health. The funding agency announced Thursday it had topped its 2016 fund drive goal and raised a projected $62,115,000. It currently supports more than 280 programs, initiatives and community change efforts. Programs that will receive money from the 2016 drive will be announced in December. Saturday's meeting was convened by the Child Collaborative, which is funded mostly by private donors and was formed in 2015. The meeting served as the official "clock," starting the countdown to the goal of moving 10,000 children out of poverty. Shifting United Way's focus was one of five major recommendations to come out of months of information gathering, community meetings and study by the collaborative. The collaborative will continue to convene the community on the child poverty problem going forward, Executive Director Lynn Marmer said. Some anti-poverty steps will be worked by the collaborative, while others will be the province of other agencies or community groups, said Marmer, a former Cincinnati Public Schools board member and Kroger Co. vice president. Multiple speakers echoed the opening words of Mayor John Cranley, another one of the co-chairs. "What we're trying to do is big stuff," he said. "Everyone in the city, everyone in the region has a responsibility" to lend a hand. Other recommendations Using the lobbying power of the region's companies and business groups to boost existing policies to help poor people move to self-sufficiency, such as the earned income tax credit. Hosting a roundtable in the first quarter of 2017 of the human resource officers of Kroger, Procter & Gamble, Macy's, TriHealth and other companies to find ways to lower barriers for entry level jobs for people in poverty. Creating "one to one" relationships between poor families and the more well-to-do to coach, encourage and strategize on problems. "We will engage with these families for years, if necessary," said Michael Fisher, president of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and one of five co-chairs of the collaborative. Confidential data on what works and what doesn't work will be kept to refine approaches over time, he said. 142 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 12 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2eH6bYG TOP VIDEOS La Salle wins regional championship 0:55 911 call: I'm being attacked by bear; I'm going to die 1:05 Joe Deters: \u0022I didn't believe the tears for a second\u0022 2:47 Are deals better on Black Friday or Cyber Monday? 1:00 Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 Student at UC Tensing forum: 'It's time for war' 0:45 Sam DuBose sister: 'This, to me, is murder' 1:30 Protests in Cincinnati after Ray Tensing mistrial 1:09 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Mistrial declared in Ray Tensing case 3:46 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01 More Stories What are the questions Tensing jurors asked during deliberations?
