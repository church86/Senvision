Looks Good Long-Term Even though slow sales have weighed the company down in recent quarters, P&G's stock history of impressive dividend yield growth and overall returns could make this a prime long-term portfolio pick. Seth McNew (TMFMcNew) Nov 4, 2016 at 3:41PM Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), the conglomerate that owns some of the world's most recognizable consumer products brands, such as Charmin, Tide, and Pampers, has a undergone some major changes in the past few years. Even though this company has faced stagnating sales in recent quarters, its historical dividend yield, decision to split off many of its non-performing brands to focus on long-term profitability, and relative market strength make this company look like a solid long-term play. Because it's such a large, established business, investors shouldn't expect massive gains in revenue or earnings in the short term, but here are a few charts to show the impressive long-term history of this company.  Image source: Procter & Gamble. Sales fall but could be set for long-term growth P&G's sales appear to be in decline, going from over $80 billion in 2013 to just $65 billion in the most recent year. However, this drop in sales is not just because P&G is losing ground in the products it sells; it's because P&G has sold off more than half of its brands. In 2014, P&G implemented a new strategy to drive growth by divesting those sub-brands that weren't helping the company grow earnings. As a result, around 100 brands have been sold off in the past two years, with 65 core brands now making up all of P&G's sales and earnings.  PG Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts Sales for fiscal 2016, which ended June 30, dropped from to $65 billion from $70 billion a year ago, but the proceeds of those brand sales led to a net income boost of 50% year over year. P&G management has said it plans for another $10 billion in cost cuts over the next five years as it focuses more on the highest-performing segments, which should help drive even more earnings growth in years to come. P&G's expanding dividend P&G's dividend has remained a strong part of this company's overall investment appeal, and its historical moves in steadily increasing its payout should give investors confidence. P&G has raised its payout consistently in each of the past 60 years. The company's most recent boost in April moved its dividend to $2.68 annually, which makes for a 3.1% yield at the current share price.  PG Dividend data by YCharts Stock price history Even though sales have fallen amid the company's turnaround strategy and the company's organic growth has been pressured by the strong dollar, its stock price has risen steadily. As seen in the following chart, even during times of broad market sell-offs, such as in 2000 or the recession of 2008, P&G has remained a pretty consistent stock, since many of P&G's products are non-cyclical, such as diapers and soap. PG data by YCharts That chart takes into account P&G's various stock splits in its long history. The company has done a 2-for-1 split five times since going public, most recently in 2004, and it's possible that it could do so again soon.  P&G has been around for more than 100 years, and its history of rewarding shareholders who stick with the company over the long term shows no signs of stopping. There's very little chance that P&G will ever be a high-growth company again, or one that's very sexy in the products it offers or the headlines it makes. For investors more concerned with steady growth for the long term instead of an exciting company, P&G's history shows that it could be a great buy going forward.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Nov 4, 2016 at 12:36PM It's early yet for Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) shareholders to break out the champagne. Sure, the company just posted its fastest sales growth pace in years. And yes, profits spiked by double-digits as cost cuts flowed directly down to the bottom line. However, P&G left its weak fiscal year guidance unchanged (projecting 2% organic growth compared to 4% for rival Unilever (NYSE: UL)), and executives warned investors to expect bumpy results ahead. "We still have work remaining to get our brands back to market levels of growth," management said. One of the biggest challenges is in the baby care division, which was the consumer goods giant's worst-performing business segment last quarter: Segment Organic Volume Organic Sales Beauty 2% 3% Grooming 3% 3% Health care 5% 7% Fabric and home care 4% 4% Baby, feminine, and family care 4% 2% Data source: Procter & Gamble. The division is home to Pampers, the leading global diaper franchise and P&G's biggest single brand by far. The company managed solid volume growth, but baby, feminine, and family care was the only segment that suffered from lower average prices. At 2%, it also brought down the company's overall organic sales growth pace. Most of that weakness was in the baby portion, where P&G lost market share in the diaper category. What happened this quarter Parts of the portfolio did well. Pampers, for one, grew at a faster pace than the overall market with help from innovations in the Cruisers product line. Things weren't as encouraging on the value end of the market, though. The Luvs diapers brand lost share in North America and P&G was forced to lower prices in Europe due to rising competition from rivals including Kimberly-Clark's (NYSE:KMB) Huggies. P&G saw hefty declines while Kimberly-Clark's Huggies volume only fell slightly. Regionally, baby care stumbled in China but Procter & Gamble managed growth in other emerging markets. The baby, feminine, and family care division lost half of a percentage point of market share last quarter compared to a flat result for fiscal 2016. Struggles in the baby care segment might help explain why P&G kept its 2% growth forecast in place despite logging 3% improved sales in the fiscal first quarter. The company also warned that expenses will creep up as it spends heavily on marketing to support its brands.  Image source: P&G investor presentation. Overall organic growth, meanwhile, should match or slightly exceed the volume figure, which will imply that P&G passed along slightly higher prices to customers and didn't need to resort to aggressive promotions to protect market share. More work to do P&G's hefty advertising budget will be critical in any turnaround plan, as will its trial program, which is the strongest in the industry (it works with hospitals to get Pampers samples to over 70% of new moms in the U.S. every year). The good news for investors is that management is working hard to address the issue. "One business where we need to make much more progress is on baby care," Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller told investors in a recent conference call as he revealed that sales shrank by double-digits. A rebound is "not something that will happen overnight," Moeller warned, but will likely be driven by a string of innovative product launches like its recent premium taped diapers release. That's why organic growth will be key for investors to watch over the next few quarters. Ideally, volume will improve at a pace that's at least even with P&G's other divisions. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Promotions are under the microscope at top consumer goods companies like P&G, where they are starting to question if the balance has tipped too far in discounting’s favor, according to a recent report in Marketing Week.   P&G’s chief financial officer Jon Moeller has argued that growing the business by significantly increasing promotion spending would be “a pyrrhic victory,” Marketing Week noted.   “When you talk about increasing trial and sampling at point of market entry and point of market change with noticeably superior products, that moves markets over time. And being able to price behind superior innovation also moves markets over time. What doesn’t move markets is leading the march down on promotion spending,” he said, speaking on an investor call.   While Moeller admitted there are many cases where investing in price promotion is an effective use of P&G’s funds, it is also looking to redirect its spend to other elements of the marketing mix.   “[We want to] focus back again on how we can drive market growth in our categories and how we can drive shopping trips and basket size for our retail partners. And it’s really [about] working together in a joint context to identify where those opportunities are,” he explained.   Other top brands are doing the same, reports Marketing Week. Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld recently said the company is shifting its spend by investing behind its “power brands” and putting a bigger emphasis on advertising rather than consumer promotion. Meanwhile, Unilever’s head of investor relations Andrew Stephen admitted the company is taking a closer look at its spending after the UK saw a “revised spate” of price promotions.   Marketing Week reasoned that when brands rely too heavily on price-led sales promotions, there is little space to focus on personality and differentiate from competitors.   To read the complete Marketing Week story, click here.

This was made known at the 2016 National Dental Association Continuing Medical Education (CME) in partnership with Oral B, aimed at educating dentists on oral care and to further develop the professional competencies of practicing dental care professionals. Giving the opening remarks titled ‘The Exceptional Dentist- 5 years of New Paradigm for Enhanced Productivity’, the Brand Marketing Director, P&G Nigeria, Tolulope Adedeji, stated that the company was sponsoring the CME for dentists in order to provide the necessary trends and development to promote and ensure ample support for oral care hygiene of Nigerians. Adedeji, describing dentists as critical partners of the company’s oral care brand that launched in Nigeria five years ago, said “the more dentists know, the better they also can give services to patients as they come.” She added that “to enable Nigerians access qualitative dental care, it is necessary we equip our dental care professionals on the constant innovations discovered in oral health care.” One of the highlights of the capacity building workshop was the exposure to dentists of the revolutionary and multipurpose benefits of stabilised stannous toothpastes with references to the research results on Stannous Fluoride with Nigerian patients. In the key presentation of Dr. Ayan Badejo, a foremost periodontist in Nigeria and lecturer at the Department of Preventive Dentistry, University of Lagos who was represented by Dr. Modupeore Shorunke recommended that Nigerians should buy toothpastes with anti-bacterial agents to clean their teeth, saying they are better in preventing tooth decay, tooth sensitivity and gum problems. Shorunke, an associate professor of Dentistry, LASUCOM, stated that toothpaste with anti-bacterial content were helpful in preventing bacterial plaque which irritates the gums and can lead to gum disease. According to her, “currently, over 90 per cent of patients seen in our dental clinic have some degree of gum disease across all age groups and socio-economic status. “Despite brushing every day, many people still find it difficult to maintain that level of plaque control that ensures that the gums are healthy. Just as fluoride is for prevention of tooth decay, so also, anti-bacterial toothpaste helps to kill the bacteria and plaque that causes gum disease.” Oral-B, in partnership with the Nigerian Dental Association (NDA), has benefited over 2000 dentists in Nigeria since the launch in 2011 updating them with the latest development in the field of dentistry.

Courts no place for politics Aftab Pureval 4:13 p.m. EDT November 4, 2016 Aftab Pureval, candidate for Hamilton County Clerk of Courts. (Photo: Provided) Aftab Pureval is the Democratic candidate for Hamilton County clerk of courts and an attorney at Procter & Gamble. As your next clerk of courts in Hamilton County, I intend to create a more accessible, modern, and efficient court system.  And unlike our current clerk, I intend to take the politics out of our courts. Multiple news organizations have reported that Tracy Winkler has arm-twisted public employees to work on her political campaign. CityBeat reported that one of her employees felt “bullied” and “stressed” and concluded, “You wonder what might happen if you don’t contribute to the Winkler campaign.”  And no wonder. Cincinnati Magazine reported that more than 85 of her employees have contributed to her campaign. It was also reported that a top aide to Winkler sent threatening e-mail during work hours to county employees and was recently reprimanded by the county for his inappropriate behavior. And how did Tracy Winkler deal with this employee? According to the Enquirer, she created a new, taxpayer-funded position that pays $70,000. She rewarded him for his political loyalty. Let’s call this what it is – a made-up job created to cover-up the political activities in the clerk’s office. An Enquirer editorial said pointedly that Winkler’s behavior was “concerning” and gave her an editorial thumbs down. We should be concerned about this kind of old-school machine politics. It’s an abuse of the public trust and an abuse of your tax dollars. As your clerk of courts, I will take the politics out of our courts. Under my leadership, no employee will contribute to my campaign – or be intimidated into volunteering for party politics. I will hire the best, most talented public servants, and empower them to do their jobs. Instead of spending $70,000 to create a position for a political crony, we should be using taxpayer resources to focus on improving services, modernizing the office, and increasing access to justice. In recent weeks, I’ve outlined ideas to do just that. First, Hamilton County should create a Legal Self-Help Clinic that would enable people to navigate the court process and solve common legal issues. This idea came from the Access to Justice summit convened by the Republican Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio and the American Bar Association. Access to justice will be my highest priority as your clerk of courts and a Legal Self-Help Clinic will be an important step forward to providing access for everyone. Second, every citizen, not just the privileged few, should be able to access court records online. Currently, online access is limited to lawyers, journalists and law enforcement. These are public records available to all who visit the county courthouse. If they are public at the courthouse, they should available to every citizen. While other counties, including Franklin County and Cuyahoga County, even tiny Preble County, have figured out how to provide online access while also keeping our records safe, Hamilton County is once again behind the times, failing to provide the modern leadership that other counties provide. No surprise, Tracy Winkler, opposes both of these ideas. Ms. Winkler has been in politics a long time. A very long time. And like many politicians who have been in office a long time, they become protectors of the status quo, creatures of the bureaucracy, and proponents of “can’t do” public policy. That kind of politics does not serve the public well. I intend to be a proponent of “can do” public policy. I intend to be an innovator who champions efficiency, technology and open records. I intend not just to “manage” but to lead. I intend to make the system work for the people – all the people – not just those with money or special privilege. The purpose of our courts is to be the great leveler – the one place where everyone is equal. As your clerk of courts, I will ensure that access to justice is available to all of us, not just some of us.

Travis Hoium (TMFFlushDraw) Nov 4, 2016 at 10:20AM There are a handful of stocks on the market that have been paying a dividend for over 100 years. Procter & Gamble, ExxonMobil, and General Mills are three such names, and one thing they hold in common is that they run very stable and (arguably) boring businesses. They're also not involved in the volatile tech industry, where some of the world's biggest companies are today, but where businesses can also go from household name to obscurity in just a few years (see BlackBerry). Nor do they sell volatile consumer discretionary goods that can swing in and out of favor.  As we look forward to the next century, investors looking for low-risk dividends that can last another 100 years should be on the lookout for businesses that won't be easily disrupted by new technology or changing lifestyles. Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL), PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP), Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW), and American Water (NYSE:AWK) are four stocks that I think will be great dividend investments built for the next century.  Image source: Getty Images. Colgate-Palmolive What could be more consistent and predictable than hygiene and cleanliness? It's a consumer staple, and Colgate-Palmolive has a large market share that it can protect by simply having more shelf space than competitors at retailers. It's not impossible to conceive that the process of personal hygiene could change dramatically in the next century, but for the foreseeable future, toothpaste, soap, and other cleaning products doesn't look as if they will be disrupted, and that near certainty will provide predictable returns for investors.  The following chart shows the company's slow but steady, growth since the early 1980s, ending with the 2.2% dividend yield the stock has today. Long-term investors should love the steady trends higher. CL Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Colgate-Palmolive may not be an exciting business, but that's kind of the point when it comes to looking for low-risk dividends.  PepsiCo The soda business isn't as strong as it once was, as health has become more of a focus for consumers, but PepsiCo is a dominant player in beverages and snacks no matter what happens in soda. It owns Frito-Lay in snacks and is moving into less sugary drinks, including Aquafina, Lipton, and Izze.  People aren't going to stop eating, and as long as PepsiCo has the products, distribution, and shelf space in grocery stores and among retailers, the company will offer a reliable dividend. And those competitive advantages aren't easy to disrupt.  The 2.8% dividend yield for PepsiCo isn't the biggest on the market, but given the company's durable competitive advantage in a food business that isn't going away, this is a dividend investors should take a hard look at.  Sherwin-Williams Technology may be changing the way we work and communicate, but the paint business hasn't changed much in decades. Sherwin-Williams is a big player in U.S. paint, but it's still a relatively small player in the fragmented global coatings market. PPG (owner of Glidden) and Akzo Nobel, which focuses on industrial applications, are both larger than Sherwin-Williams for now, but the proposed acquisition of Valspar (NYSE:VAL) will help Sherwin-Williams gain market share and pricing power in the architectural paint segment around the world. The combined companies will be close to holding the No. 2 market share position worldwide.  SHW Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Sherwin-Williams' dividend yield of 1.4% isn't the highest on this list, but it's probably one of the safest. Unless people stop painting homes and industrial structures stop needing paint for protection, the company will be making money for many decades to come.  American Water Works Once safe, electric utilities are coming under pressure from new consumer choices, such as buying solar panels and energy storage devices for their homes. That's a big reason I left electric utilities off this list. But water and wastewater utilities are facing no such pressure. For the foreseeable future, water will continue to come out of faucets tied to central water lines and waste will continue to flow to public sewers with little risk of disruption. And that's great news for American Water Works.  American Water runs a business providing water and wastewater services in regulated markets to 15 million people in 47 states and Ontario. The regulated nature of the business gives investors a predictable source of net income and cash flows. And management is targeting 7%-10% annual earnings-per-share growth from now until 2020.  Like a lot of the businesses I've discussed here, a water utility isn't terribly exciting for investors. But the 2.1% dividend yield the stock pays is coming from highly predictable cash flows in a regulated market that's still highly fragmented. Those are great features for investors looking for a dividend that will last another century, and that's why this little-known company made this list. Travis Hoium owns shares of Procter and Gamble.

Travis Hoium (TMFFlushDraw) Nov 4, 2016 at 10:20AM There are a handful of stocks on the market that have been paying a dividend for over 100 years. Procter & Gamble, ExxonMobil, and General Mills are three such names, and one thing they hold in common is that they run very stable and (arguably) boring businesses. They're also not involved in the volatile tech industry, where some of the world's biggest companies are today, but where businesses can also go from household name to obscurity in just a few years (see BlackBerry). Nor do they sell volatile consumer discretionary goods that can swing in and out of favor.  As we look forward to the next century, investors looking for low-risk dividends that can last another 100 years should be on the lookout for businesses that won't be easily disrupted by new technology or changing lifestyles. Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL), PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP), Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW), and American Water (NYSE:AWK) are four stocks that I think will be great dividend investments built for the next century.  Image source: Getty Images. Colgate-Palmolive What could be more consistent and predictable than hygiene and cleanliness? It's a consumer staple, and Colgate-Palmolive has a large market share that it can protect by simply having more shelf space than competitors at retailers. It's not impossible to conceive that the process of personal hygiene could change dramatically in the next century, but for the foreseeable future, toothpaste, soap, and other cleaning products doesn't look as if they will be disrupted, and that near certainty will provide predictable returns for investors.  The following chart shows the company's slow but steady, growth since the early 1980s, ending with the 2.2% dividend yield the stock has today. Long-term investors should love the steady trends higher. CL Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Colgate-Palmolive may not be an exciting business, but that's kind of the point when it comes to looking for low-risk dividends.  PepsiCo The soda business isn't as strong as it once was, as health has become more of a focus for consumers, but PepsiCo is a dominant player in beverages and snacks no matter what happens in soda. It owns Frito-Lay in snacks and is moving into less sugary drinks, including Aquafina, Lipton, and Izze.  People aren't going to stop eating, and as long as PepsiCo has the products, distribution, and shelf space in grocery stores and among retailers, the company will offer a reliable dividend. And those competitive advantages aren't easy to disrupt.  The 2.8% dividend yield for PepsiCo isn't the biggest on the market, but given the company's durable competitive advantage in a food business that isn't going away, this is a dividend investors should take a hard look at.  Sherwin-Williams Technology may be changing the way we work and communicate, but the paint business hasn't changed much in decades. Sherwin-Williams is a big player in U.S. paint, but it's still a relatively small player in the fragmented global coatings market. PPG (owner of Glidden) and Akzo Nobel, which focuses on industrial applications, are both larger than Sherwin-Williams for now, but the proposed acquisition of Valspar (NYSE:VAL) will help Sherwin-Williams gain market share and pricing power in the architectural paint segment around the world. The combined companies will be close to holding the No. 2 market share position worldwide.  SHW Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Sherwin-Williams' dividend yield of 1.4% isn't the highest on this list, but it's probably one of the safest. Unless people stop painting homes and industrial structures stop needing paint for protection, the company will be making money for many decades to come.  American Water Works Once safe, electric utilities are coming under pressure from new consumer choices, such as buying solar panels and energy storage devices for their homes. That's a big reason I left electric utilities off this list. But water and wastewater utilities are facing no such pressure. For the foreseeable future, water will continue to come out of faucets tied to central water lines and waste will continue to flow to public sewers with little risk of disruption. And that's great news for American Water Works.  American Water runs a business providing water and wastewater services in regulated markets to 15 million people in 47 states and Ontario. The regulated nature of the business gives investors a predictable source of net income and cash flows. And management is targeting 7%-10% annual earnings-per-share growth from now until 2020.  Like a lot of the businesses I've discussed here, a water utility isn't terribly exciting for investors.

Jamal Carnette (TMFJCar) Nov 4, 2016 at 9:32AM The worst-kept secret in financial media is that most companies want a strong dollar. Image source: Getty Images. "King Dollar" is a lie. The term, which is taken to mean that the government should attempt to keep the dollar's value high versus foreign currencies, is bandied about financial media as the cure of all economic ills. In truth, there are many economic pitfalls of a strong dollar. In the labor markets, a strong dollar encourages employers to cut domestic inputs (read: jobs) in favor of offshore production. Additionally, a stronger dollar makes it harder for U.S.-based multinationals to sell their products abroad and to convert profits back to U.S. dollars. King Dollar appears to be another economic "zombie idea" that was once accurate but has outlived its usefulness. During the '60s and '70s, when U.S.-based companies were importing inputs (especially oil) but not selling as much product abroad, a strong dollar would be of obvious benefit. Wall Street talking heads tend to skew older, and it appears many have not updated their outlook on business to account for the new economy, where oil costs have been mitigated by domestic energy production and the rise of American multinational corporations. One such multinational company, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), is caught in the crosshairs of a strengthening U.S. dollar. In an interview with CNBC, P&G CEO David Taylor noted that the company lost approximately $1 billion in pre-tax earnings because of negative currency effects in each of the past four years. If the Federal Reserve, led by Janet Yellen, decides to rapidly "normalize" interest rates (whatever that means), it could be the biggest short-term risk Procter & Gamble faces. Raising rates strengthens the dollar ... and hurts P&G It is widely expected that the Federal Reserve will raise rates at its December meeting, with a Wall Street Journal (subscription required) survey of economists finding that 81.4% felt the Fed would raise rates then. If the Fed goes through with the increase, money would flow into the United States to take advantage of higher rates, all other factors equal, which would increase the relative value of the dollar versus other currencies. For example, last year P&G noted that 23% of all sales were in Europe. In the past six months, the two largest currencies in the euro region, the British pound and the euro, have depreciated versus the dollar: Data source: US Forex.com. Rates quoted in USD per European currency. The chart shows the dollar exchange rate over the past six months for the euro and the British pound as a direct quote. Simply put, this is the amount of dollars it would take to equal one unit of euro and pound. As such, a decrease in the line on the chart signifies a strengthening of the dollar, which hurts P&G. While the euro has been mostly stable during the past six months, the pound has been, well, pounded, as concerns about Brexit have weighed on the currency. An increase in interest rates will exacerbate the dollar's strengthening versus these currencies. Even worse, a premature rush to "normalization" while other central banks continue to keep interest rates low could be the biggest risk to P&G and its stable of price-sensitive, commodity-like products in the short term. My suspicion is the "King Dollar" crowd is less concerned with the exchange rate and more interested in the rate increase. The biggest beneficiary of an increase in interest rates is not necessarily individual savers, who have mostly already chosen higher-yielding investments, but rather Wall Street banks that would immediately benefit from the net interest spread. This is especially true if they don't pass along the increased rates to their depositors, as they did the last time the Federal Reserve raised rates. To date, Yellen's Fed hasn't given in to incessant demands from financial media to rapidly "normalize" rates; P&G should hope that situation continues.   Jamal Carnette has no position in any stocks mentioned.

This was made known at the 2016 Nigerian Dental Association (NDA) Continuing Medical Education (CME) in partnership with Oral B. The Oral B dental detailing programme is aimed at educating dentists on oral care and to further develop the professional competencies of practicing dental care professionals. Giving the opening remarks titled: “The Exceptional Dentist- 5 years of New Paradigm for Enhanced Productivity” at the capacity building seminar for dentists recently in Lagos, Tolulope Adedeji, Brand Marketing Director, P&G Nigeria, stated that the company is sponsoring the CME for dentists in order to provide the necessary trends and development to promote and ensure ample support for oral care hygiene of Nigerians. Adedeji, describing dentists as critical partners of the company’s oral care brand that launched in Nigeria, five years ago, said “the more dentists know, the better they also can give services to patients as they come.” She added: “To enable Nigerians access qualitative dental care, it is necessary we equip our dental care professionals on the constant innovations discovered in oral health care.” One of the highlights of the capacity building workshop was the exposure to dentists of the revolutionary and multipurpose benefits of stabilized stannous toothpastes with references to the research results on Stannous Fluoride with Nigerian patients. In the key presentation of Dr. Ayanbadejo, a foremost periodontist in Nigeria and Lecturer at the Department of Preventive Dentistry, University of Lagos who was represented by Dr Modupeore Shorunke recommended that Nigerians should be buying toothpastes with anti-bacterial agents to clean their teeth, saying they are better in preventing tooth decay, tooth sensitivity and gum problems. Shorunke, an associate professor of Dentistry, Lagos State University College of Medicine (LASUCOM), speaking at the Continuing Medical Education Seminar, stated that toothpaste with anti-bacterial content were helpful in preventing bacterial plaque which irritates the gums and can lead to gum disease. According to her, “Currently, over 90 per cent of patients seen in our dental clinic have some degree of gum disease across all age groups and socio-economic status. Despite brushing every day, many people still find it difficult to maintain that level of plaque control that ensures that the gums are healthy. Just as fluoride is for prevention of tooth decay, so also, anti-bacterial toothpaste helps to kill the bacteria and plaque that causes gum disease.” Oral-B, in partnership with the NDA, has benefited over 2000 dentists in Nigeria since the launch in 2011 updating them with the latest development in the field of dentistry and assisting them in their career growth.

Por Sharon Terlep Sharon Terlep The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiografíaSharon Terlep @sharonterlep miércoles, 2 de noviembre de 2016 19:11 EDT ENLARGE David S. Taylor, presidente ejecutivo de Procter & Gamble (P&G) Photo: Business Wire CINCINNATI-El rápido ascenso del Dollar Shave Club y los nuevos servicios en línea de ventas tomaron por sorpresa a algunos ejecutivos de Procter & Gamble Co. y sorprendieron a una industria que consideraba que Gillette, de P&G, era una marca impenetrable. Pero el presidente ejecutivo de P&G, David Taylor, no se ha inmutado. Un año después haber asumido el timón de la mayor compañía de productos de consumo del mundo, el ejecutivo de 58 años señala que las acciones de Dollar Shave Club se están “aplanando” y que el mercado de startups tiene unos nichos de clientes muy específicos. “Si usted tiene productos de rendimiento superior y comunica bien”, dijo en una entrevista, “usted tenderá a ganar con el tiempo”. En un momento en que el cambio de hábitos de los consumidores está transformando la manera en que la gente compra y en que muchos de los gigantes corporativos más arraigados del mundo se recrean a sí mismos, Taylor evita hablar de reinvención. Su objetivo es mantener a P&G en la cima mediante la puesta en juego de sus fortalezas históricas. Un veterano de 36 años de P&G, Taylor no ha buscado comprar una startup de renombre. La empresa no ha lanzado importantes nuevas marcas ni ha previsto un cambio radical en la forma en que los consumidores compran productos básicos para el hogar. Para algunos en Wall Street, la estrategia parece arrogante. El fabricante de los pañales Pampers y del detergente Tide ha estado luchando con años de crecimiento anémico y una caída en su participación de mercado. “Todo el mundo que los rodea está cambiando y quieren seguir haciendo lo que están haciendo, en algún momento todo eso alcanzará un punto crítico”, dijo el analista de Bernstein Research Ali Dibadj. “Se siente como que la arrogancia de P&G estuviera de vuelta.” De voz suave y deliberada, Taylor se presenta como lo opuesto a arrogante. Este nativo de Charlotte, Carolina del Norte, es un ex gerente de planta que se pasó a gestión de marca y se abrió camino en las filas de P&G. Sentado en su oficina en la sede de P&G, Taylor dijo que confía en que las mejores perspectivas de P&G permanezcan arraigadas en sus fundamentos. Esto significa vender a las masas a través de las grandes cadenas minoristas en base a datos del consumidor meticulosamente recogidos, una operación masiva de investigación y desarrollo y el mayor presupuesto de publicidad del mundo. P&G tiene que aprender a hacer estas cosas más rápido y con mayor eficacia, dice. “Siempre respetamos a nuestros competidores y vamos a aprender”, dijo. “A veces tenemos que fijarnos en el valor y a veces hay que fijarnos en los resultados”. Al preguntársele sobre la reciente adquisición de Dollar Shave Club por su rival europea Unilever PLC por US$1.000 millones, anunciada como una forma de Unilever de conseguir más datos de los consumidores--, Taylor señala que P&G ya tiene ingentes cantidades de datos de los consumidores y capacidad para aprovecharlos a su disposición. La cuota de mercado de Gillette ha caído un 10% desde que Dollar Shave Club llegó a la escena, pero sigue contando con cerca del 60% del mercado de EE.UU. para máquinas de afeitar para hombres. En una reciente conferencia de resultados, el director financiero Jon Moeller respondió a una pregunta acerca de las ventas directas al consumidor destacando que ese negocio es muy pequeño. “¿Cuánta gente conoce que quiera satisfacer sus necesidades de compras productos de hogar visitando 40 sitios web diferentes por 40 productos diferentes?” P&G ha experimentado con la venta directa en el pasado, como un servicio de suscripción para Tide Pods, pero no ha sido una iniciativa importante. En su primer año, Taylor ha redoblado los esfuerzos en la reducción de costos, al anunciar en febrero un plan para eliminar un adicional de US$10.000 millones en los próximos cuatro años. La compañía ha recortado más de más de 20.000 puestos de trabajo desde 2012 y vendido más de US$20.000 millones en marcas, incluyendo Duracell y CoverGirl. Gran parte de los nuevos ahorros vendrán de una reestructuración de las cadenas de suministro de la compañía en América del Norte y Europa. P&G ha cortado pérdidas de cuota de mercado en China, que Taylor describió como un resultado “inaceptable” de la insuficiencia de la compañía para mantenerse en tope de las tendencias locales. Aunque P&G está concentrando sus esfuerzos en sus dos mercados más grandes, América del Norte y China, la compañía está trabajando para reducir costos y ser más eficientes a nivel mundial. En América Latina, donde la inestabilidad política ha contribuido a varios trimestres de resultados flojos, la compañía ha comenzado recientemente a volver a trabajar para producir múltiples productos para mejorar la flexibilidad de las operaciones de fabricación. Desde que Taylor asumió el cargo, la acción de P&G ha subido un 13%. Aun así, el ejecutivo reconoce que P&G ha tenido tropiezos. La compañía continuó su expansión en la recesión y se estiró demasiado, dijo. Luego cortó la inversión en investigación y desarrollo y construcción de marca y trató de combatir la lentitud de crecimiento aumentando los precios, cediendo en el proceso cuota de mercado. “Perdimos el equilibrio y estamos tratando de volver al equilibrio”, dijo. Clave para conseguir volver a la pista, dijo Taylor, es eliminar capas de burocracia que ralentizan el proceso de creación de nuevos productos. Los ejecutivos dicen que están viendo los resultados. Un ejemplo es el nuevo jabón de lavar ecológico de la empresa, Tide Purclean. Fue concebido y llevado al mercado en nueve meses, mientras que un nuevo producto en P&G suele tardar de dos a tres años en desarrollarse. Algo que permitió ahorrar tiempo fue un nuevo proceso en el cual los líderes de las diferentes áreas de trabajan al mismo tiempo. Así que en lugar de completar la química del producto y dar el relevo al equipo que hace que las botellas, esas partes del negocio trabajan lado a lado. En un momento, Taylor intervino para atajar lo que podría haberse convertido en una larga deliberación: la determinación del color de la tapa de la botella. Al equipo le preocupaba que un casquillo naranja—el color típico de la marca— podría distraer a los consumidores del mensaje ambiental. Pero querían estar seguros de que el detergente todavía era reconocible para los clientes. Taylor le dijo al equipo que eligieran naranja. Lori Hudson, gerente de portafolio de Bahl y Gaynor en Cincinnati que ha poseído acciones de P&G, le gusta que Taylor admitió fallas en China desde P&G, “nunca pareció ser el tipo de empresa que admitía errores”. “Pero él es un veterano de P&G que puede ser bueno o malo porque las cosas han cambiado tanto en términos de lo que quieren los clientes”, dijo Hudson. “¿Es un visionario? No lo sé”.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    The S&P 500 Index extended its longest losing streak in more than three decades, as data bolstered speculation interest rates will rise before year-end and investors remained wary before the looming presidential election. Equities faded in afternoon trading as an advance led by drugmakers lost momentum, overshadowed by declines among consumer, financial and energy shares. Procter & Gamble Co. and Amazon.com Inc. were among the biggest drags. Insurer Willis Towers Watson Plc tumbled 5.6 percent after cutting its full-year revenue forecast. The S&P 500 fell 0.2 percent to 2,085.33 at 4 p.m. in New York, after erasing a 0.5 percent advance. The gauge capped a ninth straight drop, the longest since 1980, during which it’s declined 3.1 percent. “The jobs number should increase rate-hike odds and push up the dollar further, but nothing is happening in the markets ahead of the election,” said Dennis Debusschere, a senior managing director and global portfolio strategist at Evercore ISI in New York. “All expectations of the rate outlook and by extension the markets are being muted by election uncertainty.” A report today showed payrolls climbed by 161,000 last month following a 191,000 gain in September that was larger than previously estimated. Wages rose from a year earlier by the most since 2009, and the jobless rate fell to 4.9 percent. The figures are likely to keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise borrowing costs next month for the first time in 2016. While shares have almost always risen in the days before a presidential election, anxiety about the outcome of the Nov. 8 vote has weighed on stocks, overshadowing even a Fed meeting earlier this week. The S&P 500 fell Friday as low as 2,083, its average price during the past 200 days, and a technical level it hasn’t breached since the rout that followed the U.K.’s June vote to leave the European Union. The S&P 500 posted a fourth weekly decline in the last five, down 1.9 percent as polls showed a dwindling lead for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Republican nominee Donald Trump showed strength in Iowa and Ohio pre-Election Day voting, while Clinton’s advantage in early balloting looked favorable in North Carolina and Nevada, according to a Bloomberg Politics analysis. The tightening race sent the CBOE Volatility Index to its longest streak of gains ever, and dragged the S&P 500 to a four-month low. “The U.S. elections are the elephant in the room for markets at the moment,” said Christian Gatticker, Zurich-based head of research at Julius Baer Group Ltd. “The best case is gridlock where Hillary wins and works with a Republican Congress, while a worst case is a hung vote.” Hedge fund manager Dan Loeb said he’s cutting risk in his portfolio ahead of the vote on concern that surprises could rattle financial markets. “We’ve reduced our exposures, we’ve cut some positions and increased some hedges,” Loeb said Friday in a conference call discussing results at Third Point Reinsurance Ltd., the Bermuda-based insurer where he oversees investments. “And it isn’t just about the president. Obviously who wins is going to impact the market. I think equally important is what happens in the House and Senate.” Before today’s payrolls report and the approaching election, the Fed on Wednesday kept rates unchanged in a widely expected move, and indicated the argument for raising them has strengthened. Other data this week was mixed, with modest expansion in manufacturing last month, while services industries growth slowed. Traders are pricing in a 76 percent chance the central bank will act in December, up from 69 percent a week ago. “It’s worth noting that unemployment is the single best determining factor of market direction,” said Ross Yarrow, director of U.S. Equities at Robert W. Baird & Co. In London. “The S&P 500 almost never peaks for the cycle until unemployment troughs.” Traders are also parsing corporate results as the earnings season winds down. More than four out of five S&P 500 companies have reported so far, with 56 percent beating sales estimates and 75 percent topping profit forecasts. Analyst predict earnings for members of the index grew 2.5 percent in the July-September period, snapping a five-quarter stretch of declines. © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News. All rights reserved.

The Dow Jones industrial average held flat, with Caterpillar contributing the most gains and Procter & Gamble the most losses. The S&P 500 gained 0.1 percent and was looking to snap an eight-day losing streak, with health care rising more than 1 percent to lead advancers and consumer staples leading decliners. The Nasdaq composite held just above breakeven. “Nobody wants to do anything today. … Everybody is on hold for Tuesday,” said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade. “I think next week you’ll start seeing Wall Street coronate winners and losers.

Please send us your startup announcements. Email is best: newchicagobusiness@gmail.com. Crain's contributor Robert Loerzel brings you news of fresh local startups every week. While she was on maternity leave from a job at Procter & Gamble, Chicagoan Allison Robinson decided to create the Mom Project, a website that matches women who want flexible work with project-based opportunities at companies. “It's challenging work with an emphasis on flexibility,” says Robinson, who left her job at P&G to launch the startup. “We're really trying to redefine the workplace for moms. It hasn't been very friendly.” Since the Mom Project launched in April, about 7,000 professionals have signed up for the website's free job-seeking service. “They're highly educated,” Robinson says. “They come from really great professional backgrounds, such as Boeing, Google, McDonald's, etc. They're so happy to stay on their career track but also be at home.” More than 150 companies are participating in the website, paying a fee to the Mom Project when they make a hire. Chicagoan Kimberly Grotto Howard, who owns Grotto Marketing, used the Mom Project to line up a work project with Braeside Condominium Management. She says she likes the tone that the Mom Project sets in conversations between job-seekers and employers. “It's almost like they look at you like a human being rather than a machine—from the beginning,” she says. Hidden down an alley in Evanston, The Barn opened for business Tuesday, Nov. 1, serving what it calls a “meat-centric” menu. The restaurant is inside a 19th-century brick barn at the rear of 1016 Church St. that once housed the stable of delivery horses for Borden Condensed Milk Co. The Barn's proprietor is Amy Morton, daughter of Arnie Morton, who founded Morton's Steakhouses, and the chef is Nicole Pederson. They're the same team that opened Found restaurant in Evanston four years ago. Barrington startup F3 Cycling seeks to raise $45,000 on Kickstarter to manufacture the FormMount Bicycle Computer Mount—an adjustable mount that holds GPS devices of any size above the handlebars of a bicycle. The campaign, which ends Nov. 20, has raised about $28,000 so far for the mount, which was created by Tim Boundy, Frank Pistorio and Mike Scalise. It's available for pledges starting at $43. The Apothecary is a deck of playing cards that change color when touched by hands. It's the creation of Chicagoan Alexander Chin, who runs Seasons Playing Cards and the Shung Shung package design studio. Chin has raised more than $50,000 with a Kickstarter campaign to launch the color-changing playing cards, more than meeting his $20,000 goal. With heat-sensitive technology, the cards will turn from juniper green to yellow or coral to lavender when they're handled. The cards are available for pledges starting at $14 while the campaign runs, through Nov. 16. Other new businesses we've spotted: Tytin Jewelry, a shop and studio, has opened at 4825 N. Western Ave. in Lincoln Square. In addition to offering her own jewelry, owner Tina Cannon sells pieces created by other independent designers as well as jewelry-making tools. And Tytin hosts workshops and provides studio space for jewelers to work. . . . Chicago-based Aligned Modern Health opened its eighth local wellness clinic on Tuesday, Nov. 1, at 1335 S. Michigan Ave. in the South Loop. Update: We reported earlier this year about Musically Human Theatre coming to Highland Park, but as Crain's now reports, the theater company has closed without producing a single show.

Published on November 04, 2016. Credit: iStock Most Popular Data-driven targeting on publishers' websites may be headed for a "natural correction," according to Chris Copeland, president of ad-tech platform Yieldbot. The correction, Mr. Copeland argues, will come as marketers trim spending on certain consumer targeting to compensate for rising minimum prices on publishers' inventory. His view isn't universally held -- more on that below -- but Mr. Copeland said several red flags have already materialized. In August, for example, No. 1 advertiser Procter & Gamble said data targeting had limited effectiveness for certain products. "I think what brands need to understand is what targeting is really a needle mover and what targeting makes them feel all warm and fuzzy," Mr. Copeland said. "It's a bit of, 'Do you really need a seven-course meal if a three-course meal is going to fill you up?'" In this scenario, the key change is the proliferation of header bidding ad technology, which has let premium publishers see that their inventory is often worth more than the bids they used to accept. "What header bidding meant for the marketplace is suddenly inventory that was historically bought at a lower price starts to rise," Mr. Copeland said. "There's more competition and different valuations to different inventory. And floor prices are being put into place." Should floor prices rise, sophisticated data overlays -- such as targeting that can tell marketers whether a given web surfer shopped at Walmart last week -- will get a hard look from advertisers. Chris Copeland, president at Yieldbot. Credit: YieldBot "Now everyone is better at understanding where their place is, what the cost is," Mr. Copeland said. "And I think we will start to see everyone reconsider where they invest and how they invest because it won't be as cheap as it was two or three years ago." Eric Eichmann, CEO of ad tech powerhouse Criteo, doesn't agree. "First, let's start with the premise of supply and demand," he said. "Advertising demand is not expected to change dramatically. And publisher inventory is not changing dramatically. The only thing that has changed is header bidding." Header bidding has increased revenue for publishers and costs for advertisers, but the disruption will "flush itself out in a couple of quarters," Mr. Eichmann argued. "Marketers will adapt their bidding strategy to reflect the fact that they are in a different bidding environment," Mr. Eichmann said. "Over time, we think the effects of header bidding will be substantially less, and the people who will win are those who are smart about how they bid in an environment where everybody is bidding at the same time." Related Stories Retail Websites Pile on the Ad Tech, but May Be Repeating Publishers' Mistakes Facebook Seizes Header Bidding to Challenge Google in Programmatic Ad Sales Header Bidding Wrappers Are the Next Ad-Tech Craze (for Large Publishers) Rubicon Project Lays Off 19%, Still Feeling the Pain From Header Bidding If that means publishers can't hike their minimum prices, data overlays won't face new scrutiny. Header bidding has gained widespread adoption from publishers -- and even retailers to an extent -- because it lets everyone bid on ad inventory at the same time. The previous prevailing system of so-called "waterfall auctions" went through groups of buyers in turn, accepting the first decent offer without getting bids from later groups in the queue. Buyers who don't have the technology to properly handle header bidding will wind up paying "$10 instead of $9," Mr. Eichmann said. But tactics will evolve, he said. "Fundamentally, the publisher inventory hasn't changed and the advertising demand hasn't changed, so over time I think the dynamics won't be as dramatic as you had in the beginning."

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases pr @ satprnews.com UCLA Anderson School of Management Honors Retired Boeing Chairman, President and CEO W. James McNerney, Jr., Awarded 2016 John Wooden Global Leadership Award LOS ANGELES–(BUSINESS WIRE)–UCLA Anderson School of Management honored W. James (Jim) McNerney, Jr., retired chairman, president and CEO of The Boeing Company, with the 2016 John Wooden Global Leadership Award on Nov. 2, 2016, at a banquet held at the California Science Center in Los Angeles. The award, named for legendary UCLA basketball coach, author and leadership expert John Wooden (1910–2010), is given each year to an exceptional individual in corporate America whose leadership style and service to the community reflect the same high benchmarks of performance, integrity and ethical values set by Wooden. McNerney was selected as this year’s recipient for the exceptional leadership he has displayed throughout his career at some of the world’s largest and most iconic companies, including General Electric, 3M and, most recently, Boeing, where he served as chairman, president and CEO for a decade. “It would be difficult to identify another executive who has delivered as superb results across such complex global businesses as Jim McNerney,” said UCLA Anderson Dean Judy Olian. “Whether at GE, 3M or Boeing, Jim was laser focused on culture, process and integrity – with fantastic results that followed. It’s about winning, the right way, just like Coach Wooden demonstrated in his decades of coaching and teaching.” Over the course of his career, McNerney has received numerous honors and recognitions, including being named “CEO of the Year” in 2015 by Chief Executive magazine and the 2008 National Management Association’s Executive of the Year. By appointment of U.S. President Barack Obama, he serves on the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees. He previously chaired the President’s Export Council. He serves on the board of trustees of the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, and he is a past chair and previous member of the executive committee of Business Roundtable. He also is a past chair of the US-China Business Council. He is a director of Procter & Gamble, a director of IBM, a member of The Field Museum Board of Trustees in Chicago, a trustee of Northwestern University, the chair of the Northwestern Memorial HealthCare Board and of the Kellogg School Dean’s Advisory Board. “John Wooden’s way of going about things is envious,” said McNerney. “I loved watching his teams and the way every individual found his or her potential, yet the team was the best team on the floor. I understand the connection between individual and team achievement and making it all work.” Previous John Wooden Global Leadership Honorees include: Ursula Burns (chairman and CEO, Xerox), Paul E. Jacobs (executive chairman, Qualcomm), Robert Iger (chairman and CEO, Disney), Indra Nooyi (chairman and CEO, PepsiCo), Peter Ueberroth (managing director, Contrarian Group, and president of the Los Angeles Olympics Organizing Committee), Frederick Smith (president and CEO, FedEx), Kenneth Chenault (chairman and CEO, American Express Company) and Howard Schultz (chairman, president and CEO, Starbucks). Net proceeds from the event fund fellowships for UCLA Anderson students who embody Coach Wooden’s leadership ideals and commitment to improving the lives of others. Each of the four 2016 John Wooden Global Leadership Fellows receive a $25,000 fellowship: Corey McMillen (MBA ’17) Datra Oliver (FEMBA ’18) Doug Larratt (EMBA ’17) Eric Potocek (FEMBA ’18) “One of our primary goals is to educate and develop future generations of global leaders,” said Dean Olian. “The John Wooden Global Leadership Award ceremony furthers that goal in several ways. First, the leadership examples set by both Coach Wooden and Jim McNerney serve as inspiration for all of our students. Awarding the Wooden Fellowships to our most deserving recipients assists the fellows as they pursue their own dreams and passions.” About the John Wooden Global Leadership Award As the most winning coach in men’s college basketball, Wooden’s legacy of leadership transcends athletics and spans generations. As a coach, prolific author and inspiring speaker, he dedicated his life to motivating individuals to achieve their highest potential. Wooden instilled in others a sense of pride, a commitment to ethics and a respect for teamwork. UCLA Anderson extends these fundamental principles and Wooden’s famous Pyramid of Success into the classroom through the Wooden Global Leadership Program.

The research study covers the present scenario and growth prospects of the global facial wipesmarketfor 2016-2020. To calculate the market's size, the report considers the revenue generated from the retail sales of different types of facial wipes to individual consumers. The use of facial wipes is relatively high among consumers aged 20-39 years, as this age group focuses more on personal grooming at large. Sales of facial wipes to this consumer segment generated more than 50% of the global facial wipes market's revenue in 2015. Over the coming years, vendors are expected to increase their focus on marketing initiatives that are targeted toward this age group, with an increased focus on social media platforms, which remain highly frequented by this demography. For instance, marketing campaigns such as Unilever's 'We believe in goodness' for Simple, Kimberly-Clark's 'wipe away' for KLEENEX, and Johnson Johnson's 'WipeForWater' for Neutrogena facial wipes are targeted at the youth and the middle-aged consumer segment. Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=54065 Technavio's sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. Technavio consumer and retailanalysts highlight the following three factors that are contributing to the growth of the global facial wipes market: Availability of products specific to different skin types and concerns Smaller packs and multipurpose facial wipes Increasing inclination toward all-natural facial wipes Availability of products specific to different skin types and concerns In addition to skin types, manufacturers offer facial wipes targeted at specific skin concerns such as acne/blemishes, aging skin, blackheads, fine lines/wrinkles, loss of firmness/elasticity, dark circles, dark spots, dryness, dullness/uneven texture, oiliness, pores, puffiness, redness, and uneven skin tones. Some products offer multifunctional benefits as well. For instance, Olay Total Effects 7-In-1 Anti-Aging Facial Cleanser Lathering Cleansing Cloths from P&G targets multiple skin concerns such as aging skin, dark spots, and dryness. Brijesh Kumar Choubey, a lead cosmetics and toiletry analyst at Technavio, says, "The age group of target consumers is another major factor considered by skincare product manufacturers. For instance, Estée Lauder, through its brand CLINIQUE, and LVMH, through its brand philosophy, offer facial wipes for different age groups such as teens, age group of 20-29 years, and age group of 30-39 years." Smaller packs and multipurpose facial wipes Convenience and portability are the two major factors considered by consumers when they buy facial wipes. To specifically target the varying needs of consumers, manufacturers of skincare products are introducing smaller or travel-sized packs of facial wipes. These smaller packs are portable and are available at low costs. Such advantages offered by smaller packs create a value proposition for consumers who lead a hectic lifestyle and who travel frequently. Developed markets such as the US, the UK, Germany, Japan, and Australia have a relatively high penetration of smaller packs of facial wipes. "Multipurpose wipes are gaining rapid popularity. Consumers have started preferring facial wipes that provide multiple benefits such as removal of facial breakouts and acne, dryness, enlarged pores, oiliness, fine lines and wrinkles, redness and rosacea, and loss of elasticity," adds Brijesh Increasing inclination toward all-natural facial wipes The demand for natural products is increasing across markets, which includes facial wipes as well. With a rise in awareness about the effects of chemicals such as parabens and multiple hydrocarbons on the skin in the long run, consumers have now started looking for facial wipes that are made with natural and herbal ingredients. This awareness is higher in developed western countries, followed by developing countries such as China, India, and Brazil, where natural facial wipe products are being launched. In addition to established players, domestic or regional players such as Pacifica and SheaMoisture are also extending their product portfolio to include natural facial wipes. Some examples of popular natural facial wipes from these smaller manufacturers include Purify Coconut Water Cleansing Wipes, Enzymatic Wipes Mini, Purify Coconut Wipe Mini, and Enzymatic Exfoliating Wipes from Pacifica; and Raw Shea Butter Hydrating Cleansing Facial Wipes, Superfruit Multivitamin Renewal Cleansing Facial Wipes, and Coconut Hibiscus Radiance Cleansing Facial Wipes from SheaMositure.

Published on November 03, 2016. Most Popular Credit: 1010data Amazon's private-label program has become a major threat to big brands in certain categories, particularly batteries, according to a new analysis from 1010data, the data management firm. Based on measurement of online spending from a panel of more than 10 million consumers between September 2015 and August 2016, 1010data found that Amazon and affiliates controlled a whopping 94% of the approximately $113 million in online battery sales. The AmazonBasics private label had a 31% share of online battery sales, according to 1010data, more than double the 13.1% share that private-label batteries had in offline stores for the 52 weeks ended Oct. 18, according to Nielsen data from Deutsche Bank. AmazonBasics, in fact, easily outsold every battery brand online, including offline leader Duracell, now owned by Berkshire Hathaway after Procter & Gamble Co. divested it in March. Duracell had a 21% online share. The titans of offline batteries can take solace in the fact that the online category remains small. It's only around 4% of the Nielsen-measured offline business, which doesn't even include big outlets like Costco, home improvement stores and some dollar stores. But the online battery category is growing fast, up 75% in the past year, according to 1010data. And AmazonBasics is growing even faster, with sales up 93%. The conversion rate, or the percentage of people who buy batteries after viewing them online, is 17.7% for AmazonBasics, vs. 9.8% for the category as a whole. Amazon is also making less-dramatic headway in other categories such as baby wipes, where its Elements private label has 16% of the estimated $60 billion in online sales. Here Amazon and affiliates have a smaller but still commanding 80% share of online sales, according to 1010data. Kimberly-Clark Corp.'s Huggies and P&G's Pampers are the category leaders in wipes online, just like offline. And at this point, Amazon's private-label share is still behind the nearly 37% store-brand share in offline outlets measured by Nielsen. But at less than two years old, Amazon Elements is newer than AmazonBasics, which launched its batteries in 2009. Amazon also has a commanding presence in the bigger $1 billion market for online speakers behind its Echo brand, according to 1010 data, with a 45% market share among the top 10 brands sold. Echo sales are up 67% year over year, according to the firm. "No matter the market, the challenge for brands in an increasing number of categories is that Amazon is the top online channel," said Jed Alpert, senior VP-marketing at 1010data, in a statement. "The bottom line for brands is that they can no longer view Amazon as solely a channel and need to acknowledge Amazon as a competitor." Reasons for Amazon's private-label success vary across markets, he said, with price the key driving factor in batteries, but a truly innovative product fueling the growth of Echo.

The fall came despite relatively good news about the health of US jobs markets. The Labor Department reported Friday that the US economy had added a solid 161,000 new jobs in October while the unemployment rate edged lower to 4.9 per cent, a result which analysts said pointed to general all-around health in the economy and suggested the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates next month. The S&P closed down 3.48 points (0.17 per cent) at 2,085.18. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 42.39 points (0.24 per cent) to 17,888.28 while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also lost 12.04 points (0.24 per cent) to settle at 5,046.37.

Ohio-based consumer goods company Procter & Gamble was among the heaviest blue chip losers of the day, finishing down 1.8 per cent at US$85.08, erasing much of the gains made since reporting stronger third-quarter earnings last week.

The Eastern Panhandle and Beckley regions of West Virginia will be the next two targets for the West Virginia University Bureau of Business and Economic Research this month. The Bureau of Business and Economic Research at WVU, housed within the College of Business, provides an annual economic forecast for the state, country and regions throughout the state. The Eastern Panhandle Economic Outlook Conference luncheon will be Nov. 15 at the Holiday Inn in Martinsburg. The region has been one of the few in the state to have avoided the economic pains seen in the rest of the state. WVU, in partnership with the New River Gorge Regional Development Authority, will present the New River Gorge Regional Economic Summit Nov. 17 at Tamarack. “The Bureau of Business and Economic Research at WVU has been the source of economic expertise for decades, and our presentation of this event demonstrates our important role of thought leadership,” said John Deskins, director of the BBER. “The state is at an interesting juncture, and our economic forecasting and analysis is critical to the next steps outlined by West Virginia. “We look forward to providing this information … so that business leaders, policymakers and residents will have access to the information they need going forward.” The Eastern Panhandle event will host Andy Bauer, regional economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, who will present the U.S. Economic Outlook. Ray Owens, senior economist and policy advisor for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, will open the Beckley breakfast event. Deskins pointed out the Eastern Panhandle of WV has experienced positive growth in the past year, and cited the 2012 opening of Macy’s distribution center and the Procter & Gamble facility that is expected to open in 2017. Deskins said the P&G project will have a “ripple effect” and spur even more jobs. WVU Beckley/WVU Tech Campus President Carolyn Long will speak during the Beckley event, along with a post-election, nonpartisan discussion led by Brian Helmick of Spilman Thomas & Battle, to talk about what state residents and its business community can expect from the upcoming legislative session. Deskins said the Beckley region has seen economic opportunities in the realms of hospitality, tourism, health care and manufacturing, but significant declines in the coal industry have hurt the area. He predicts the formal, full-scale operation of the WVU Beckley Campus, which is expected to happen in fall 2017, will give the region a boost. “Stakeholders in our state have a lot of questions about where our economy is headed, and they want hard data and rigorous and unbiased economic analysis,” Deskins said. “I believe West Virginia is at a crossroads, and we must look to other sectors to boost our sagging economy. “The time in which the roles of alternative industries will play a major part has passed, and the urgency of planning for the future is here.” BusinessBusinessMore>> One dream, two restaurants: an immigrant’s tale One dream, two restaurants: an immigrant’s tale Updated: Sunday, November 20 2016 12:00 PM EST2016-11-20 17:00:14 GMT Who would ever dream of offering six types of Mediterranean cuisines to try to please the discerning palates of Eastern Panhandle residents?

Why are you running for office? Property taxes continue to increase each year, while the county schools lack the funding for repairs and updated equipment. Industries look at the schools, the education systems as a strong, solid foundation of a county. In order for the county to grow the tax base county commissioners and school board officials need to seek out grants and explore other avenues to acquire revenue to support school capital projects. We have great teachers that need a well functioning schools and the resources to teach the required skills to our children/young adults for them to be able to work in not only today, but also in the future work forces of the 21st century. I want to work with the school board to bring in resources to improve our county schools.I want to seek way to grow the tax base that will bring real jobs to Chowan County. I want to find the means to reduce the county poverty level. 2. Why should people vote for you? I have integrity, commitment and experience with multi-million dollar budgets. I will work to reduce property taxes. I believe that all elected officials, thru their actions, shall be committed to protecting the health, safety & welfare of all the county citizens. I will work toward improving the counties infrastructure that manufacturing industries need in order to operate in the county. I will encourage and support additional technical training at the high school & College of the Albemarle campuses. Technical training will provide the citizens greater opportunities to learn skills that attract new business to Chowan County. 3. What’s your favorite thing about the area you want to represent? Small bedroom communities interacting with farms to create a family friendly county. The people are great, for the most part they want less government, less taxes and to be able to spend/save their money for what they want, not what the government dictates. 4. What is the biggest problem your area is facing, how will you fix it? There is a double edge problem: Low tax base and a 27+ % of Chowan counties population below the poverty level. By increasing the tax base ( growing jobs ), will help decrease the poverty rate. I will work toward solving the problem by following thru with my statements #1 & 2 above. 5. Describe Donald Trump in max 3 words? Businessman 6. Describe Hillary Clinton in max 3 words? Another dishonest politician 7. What do you do for a living? Why do you do it? I served 23 years in the United States Navy, Vietnam & Persian Gulf Veteran in several leadership positions. I joined the Navy after high school. I want to do my part to protect our freedoms, liberty and the people I love. Worked 6 years with Procter & Gamble as a Manufacturing & Utilities Manager. Worked 16 years with Mitsubishi Kagaku Imaging Corp. as a Production and Logistics Supervisor. Retired and now serving as a member & treasure of the Beekeepers of the Albemarle ( 118 active members ). Served a term on the N.C. Workforce Development Commission. While visiting Community Colleges thru-out the state, I heard business leaders talk about the skills needed for young and older adults in the job market today. Active member of the Chowan Perquimans Habitat for Humanity. Worked many hours on the projects this year. Active member of the Edenton United Methodist Church. The jobs, work that I have done over the years has been fulfilling, rewarding and enabled me to help others learn and grow. A person should always be teaching others, not only your own personal job, but also areas where they can continue to grow and to seek new knowledge as well. 8. You’re going to be marooned on a tropical island for a week, you can only bring 1 thing – what is it? This being a tropical island, I would believe there is water, food and shelter. Then all I would need to take is a Bible. 9. What do you think of Colin Kaepernick? A very spoiled and disrespectful young man. 10. Would you vote to fund light rail expansion in your area? NO 11. Will you respect the outcome of the election? There has been problems in every election that I know of since I became of age to vote ( 21 at that time ). So, who ever wins the election, there will be voter fraud. And until the media takes the time to researches and publish the facts, until the justice system remain blind to the who and seeks out the facts, there will always be voter fraud. So, to answer your question – NO. Even if the person I vote for wins. There is still voter fraud that need to be fixed. Start with VOTER I.D. 12. Favorite TV Show? Nascar, where prayer is given before each event, where the U.S. flag is still respected, where our Military and First Responders are still respected and treated as the heroes they are.

Suit threatened over West Virginia's access to waters of Potomac - Business, Government Legal News from throughout WV Member Center: Create Account| Log In Manage Account| Log Out SITE SEARCHWEB SEARCH BY Home News Business Government Energy Law Opinion Lynne D. Schwabe Brooks McCabe Charlie Bowen John Brown Dolly Withrow Linda Arnold Government Law Energy SHOP About Us Job Openings Suit threatened over West Virginia's access to waters of Potomac River Posted: Thursday, November 3, 2016 2:27 PM EDT Updated: Thursday, November 3, 2016 2:53 PM EDT Efforts to limit West Virginia's access to the Potomac River could land the State of Maryland in court, the WV Attorney General's Office said. The office expressed willingness to sue Maryland if its leaders continue to limit West Virginia's access to the Potomac River, a water source said to be critical to economic expansion in the Eastern Panhandle. Those concerns were outlined in a letter to Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh and Secretary of the Environment Benjamin H. Grumbles challenging Maryland’s time-consuming and costly permit process, arguing the Mountain State’s neighbor has no legal authority to interfere with West Virginia’s access to the Potomac River. The letter voices concern Maryland is claiming regulatory authority to tilt the competitive balance in its favor by limiting the Mountain State's access to basic utilities, like water. The letter comes at a time when rapid population growth and commercial development is projected to increase the Eastern Panhandle’s daily demand for water by 2 million gallons, including a Procter & Gamble plant under construction in Martinsburg, WV, which, by itself, will require 1.3 million gallons each day to maintain operations.   The letter cites as legal authority a 1785 compact between Maryland and Virginia, which gave Virginia a sovereign right to the Potomac’s water. The U.S. Supreme Court has suggested that West Virginia, which has a common history with Virginia, is entitled to the same rights under the 231-year-old compact. Maryland’s leadership has 21 days to agree that its agencies lack authority to regulate West Virginia’s use of the Potomac and agree to work with West Virginia in drafting an interstate compact for submission to the U.S. Congress. Otherwise, the letter states West Virginia will file an original action with the U.S. Supreme Court to seek a declaration of its rights to the Potomac River.

(sorry in advance  for my english)   My name is Gustavo Barcamor, and I've been a professional composer since 2006. I specialized in games in 2010. Did some international jobs too, but since i work in Brazil, I would like to talk to you about how is videogames music doing around the world, for those of us who are not big in the industry. I have a lot of experience, since I've been working here as a composer for games by Intel, LG, P&G... but it's not common here.

Beiersdorf said it now expected its margin on earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in 2016 to significantly exceed the year-earlier figure of 14.4 percent. That is better than a previous forecast for a slight improvement. The new guidance meant an increase by more than 0.5 percentage points, finance chief Jesper Andersen told analysts, without being more specific. Margins were boosted by more efficient procurement and logisitcs as well as lower marketing expenses, he said. Beiersdorf stuck with its forecast for 3 to 4 percent sales growth this year with its consumer business, which includes cosmetics brands Nivea, Eucerin and La Prairie, bouncing back after a slow first half of the year. But its margins continue to be lower than those of consumer goods competitors, such as Unilever, Procter & Gamble and L'Oreal, which in recent months have been snatching up smaller companies and niche brands to build scale and enter new consumer markets. Pressed by analysts on whether Beiersdorf intended to follow a similar path, Chief Executive Stefan Heidenreich said the company's main priority remained organic growth. "It's true that we have cash and that we are looking at things," Heidenreich said. "But we will follow our strategy which is organic, organic and then, if something comes, we will look at it." Organic sales across all business segments rose by 2.9 percent to 5.03 billion euros ($5.60 billion) in the first nine months of 2016. The group did not publish earnings figures for the period. Shares in Beiersdorf were up 4 percent at 81.52 euros by 1040 GMT, outperforming a flat German blue-chip index. They earlier rose more than 6 percent.

On the macro front, the Nikkei India Services Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, rose to 54.5 in October from 52 in September. A reading above 50 indicates economic expansion, while a reading below 50 points toward contraction. The service sector joined its manufacturing counterpart in offering a more upbeat level of performance this month, providing reassurance in the sustainability of the upturn of India's economy, Pollyanna De Lima, economist at IHS Markit said. She added that one underlying concern is the sustained stagnant trend in workforces, with both manufacturers and service providers showing some reluctance to hire. Meanwhile, international rating agency Standard & Poor's (S&P) yesterday, 2 November 2016 affirmed "BBB-/A-3" rating with stable outlook for India. The stable outlook balances India's sound external position and inclusive policy making tradition against the vulnerabilities stemming from its low per capita income and weak public finances, S&P said. The ratings on India reflect the country's sound external profile and improved monetary credibility, the agency said. The outlook indicates that rating agency does not expect to change its rating on India this year or next, based on our current set of forecasts, it said. Improvements in policy making continue to strengthen the prospects for India's economic and fiscal performance. Wide fiscal deficits, a heavy debt burden, and low per capita income nonetheless detract from the sovereign's credit profile, it added. In overseas stock markets, most Asian stocks were trading lower with uncertainty over next week's US presidential election sending investors rushing for the sidelines. US stocks fell yesterday, 2 November 2016, with the S&P 500 recording its longest losing streak in five years after the Federal Reserve, as expected, kept interest rates unchanged. The Federal Reserve yesterday, 2 November 2016 signaled that the time for another interest-rate hike is approaching and it doesn't need much more evidence before moving. The Fed policy committee voted 8 to 2 to maintain interest rates in a range of 0.25 to 0.5%. The Fed said inflation has been moving up toward its 2% target since the beginning of the year. Meanwhile, polls showed a tightening presidential race. A latest poll reportedly showed Republican nominee Donald Trump taking a one-point lead over rival Hillary Clinton. Investors generally view Clinton as a known quantity, but there is deep uncertainty about what a Trump win might mean for US economic policy, free trade and geopolitics.

Affordability and rising consumer base in the country are also responsible for high cosmetic sales [ClickPress, Wed Nov 02 2016] In the cosmetics and beauty sector, there have been sweeping changes. Expensive international beauty products are selling rapidly as the Indian women are investing in long term beauty. The biggest beauty evolution in India's recent past, however, is not restricted to women. Men have taken to healthier skin routine, away from the gym. The rise in men's salons is evidence to the fact that men want more beauty for themselves. The menu cards on offer at men's salons include treatments that were earlier meant for women. Men's salons have now started offering a multitude of beauty services while beauty brands now have a special product line-up dedicated specifically for men's grooming. As per ASSOCHAM, the per capita consumption of cosmetics in India is approximately US$ 0.68 cents as compared to US$ 40 in Hong Kong, US$ 12 in Japan, and US$ 1.5 in China. Consumption of these products centers on young women, with the age group 15-44 years accounting for about 70% of the market. Consumption begins in the teens and tapers off after 45, and declines substantially after 55. According to recently published report of Bonafide Research India Cosmetic Market Outlook, 2021, cosmetic market in India was growing with a CAGR of 17.06% over past few years. The urban population with increasing purchasing power is the major force driving demand for cosmetic products. India is a very price-sensitive market and mass-market products constitute the major part of the cosmetics market. Urban India leads the market, with more than four-fifth of the cosmetic segment consumption by volume. However, rural consumption exceeds urban consumption in toilet soaps and is almost equal to urban sales of hair oil, the lowest end of the hair care market. Many domestic and international companies are now targeting the rural markets to push volume sales in categories like lip and nail care, and some mass skin care products as well. Meanwhile, urban consumption is evolving, moving from basic functional to more superior and specialized products, and greater expenditure levels. Moreover, there is a rise in consumption of mens products, including skin care products, which were earlier considered purely the womans sphere. The dominant international players include Hindustan UniLever, the subsidiary of Unilever with all its international and Indian brands, LOreal, along with its subsidiary Maybelline and Garnier brands, Revlon, Nivea, Biersdorf, Schwarzkopf, Palmolive, and Proctor & Gamble including Gillette. Lakmé as a brand dominates the cosmetic industry in India, owned by Unilever. Stiff competition has resulted in an increase in the range of new products being introduced for newer application concepts in the last few years. In the skin-care segment, from just creams and moisturizers, there has been an upgrade to value-added products such as under eye wrinkle removing creams, dark circle removing creams toners, sunscreen lotions, fairness creams, and many more. The colour cosmetics market saw new products such as smudge-proof lipsticks and mascaras, liquid lip colour, and long-lasting lipsticks being introduced. However, low and medium-priced categories account for almost 85-90% of the cosmetics market in terms of volume.

this article CHICAGO, Nov. 4, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- With the Chicago Cubs heading into the playoffs in late September and no way to predict the outcome, Alison Miller, VP of Marketing for the Windy City's MLB team, had to think ahead. In addition to creating a new "Fly the W" campaign for the post season, she asked Schafer Condon Carter (SCC), the Cubs agency of record, to consider how to handle a potential World Series victory. It was an off-the-record assignment that had to be secretly planned and executed. SCC's idea was to memorialize the Cubs' journey to a World Series victory through the eyes of Cubs' fans set to a song from a very famous Cubs fan, Pearl Jam front man Eddie Vedder. His song, "Someday We'll Go All The Way," is a tribute to Cubs fans' passion–and their patience–in pursuit of that elusive World Series Championship.  "Those are truly human moments and emotions that you just can't create. You have to be there. They have to be real," said SCC's Leroy Koetz, who directed and edited the spot. "Eddie's track as the backdrop for these moments really tells a powerful story." Shot at dozens of locations throughout Chicago while the Cubs made their playoff run, the 60-second spot incorporates footage lensed at the conclusion of the Cubs dramatic 10th inning Game 7 win in Cleveland. The final edit was finished just a few hours before sunrise that morning.  "We wanted to capture the real, genuine emotion that true, die-hard Cub fans experienced during this amazing run," said SCC Creative Director, Ron Sone. "We thought it was important that we get the real thing at that critical moment." SCC's video production team embedded multiple crews in fans' homes, Chicago bars and even a Wrigleyville fire station to capture the moments as they unfolded. In addition, SCC shot footage at multiple games at Wrigley Field, and also pulled video from network broadcasts, Cubs' video partner Banner Collective, and Cubs' in-house video resources. After launching on social media at 5:00 a.m. Thursday morning, the spot was viewed millions of times within a few hours. Its reach was extended dramatically as it was picked up as a news story and played nationally on the Today Show, ESPN and on broadcast media around the country.  "The Chicago Cubs are a great American story," said SCC Managing Partner, Jim Stadler. "It goes way beyond Chicago. The Cubs are a global brand at this point and winning it all this year is a source of joy and inspiration for millions of people." SCC's work on for the Cubs also included the World Series Parade and celebration in Chicago. "Sleep is going to have to wait," said Molly Gilles, SCC Senior Account Executive. "But this is all so exciting, you want to soak up every minute of it." "We began this journey with the Cubs four seasons ago," said Michael Dorich, SCC Creative Director. "We've been bleeding Cubby blue every day working with this great team and absolutely loving it. To have the Cubs bring home a World Series Championship is more than we could ask for - we couldn't be more proud." About Schafer Condon Carter Schafer Condon Carter (SCC) is an independent integrated creative agency that delivers seamless brand content across an infinite set of consumer touch points for its clients. SCC clients include Allen Edmonds, the Chicago Cubs, Johnson & Johnson, National Pork Board, Procter & Gamble and Pepsico among others.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases pr @ satprnews.com Schafer Condon Carter's (SCC) Chicago Cubs World Series Victory Spot A Late Night Labor Of Love CHICAGO, Nov. 4, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — With the Chicago Cubs heading into the playoffs in late September and no way to predict the outcome, Alison Miller, VP of Marketing for the Windy City’s MLB team, had to think ahead. In addition to creating a new “Fly the W” campaign for the post season, she asked Schafer Condon Carter (SCC), the Cubs agency of record, to consider how to handle a potential World Series victory. It was an off-the-record assignment that had to be secretly planned and executed. SCC’s idea was to memorialize the Cubs’ journey to a World Series victory through the eyes of Cubs’ fans set to a song from a very famous Cubs fan, Pearl Jam front man Eddie Vedder. His song, “Someday We’ll Go All The Way,” is a tribute to Cubs fans’ passion–and their patience–in pursuit of that elusive World Series Championship.  “Those are truly human moments and emotions that you just can’t create. You have to be there. They have to be real,” said SCC’s Leroy Koetz, who directed and edited the spot. “Eddie’s track as the backdrop for these moments really tells a powerful story.” Shot at dozens of locations throughout Chicago while the Cubs made their playoff run, the 60-second spot incorporates footage lensed at the conclusion of the Cubs dramatic 10th inning Game 7 win in Cleveland. The final edit was finished just a few hours before sunrise that morning.  “We wanted to capture the real, genuine emotion that true, die-hard Cub fans experienced during this amazing run,” said SCC Creative Director, Ron Sone. “We thought it was important that we get the real thing at that critical moment.” SCC’s video production team embedded multiple crews in fans’ homes, Chicago bars and even a Wrigleyville fire station to capture the moments as they unfolded. In addition, SCC shot footage at multiple games at Wrigley Field, and also pulled video from network broadcasts, Cubs’ video partner Banner Collective, and Cubs’ in-house video resources. After launching on social media at 5:00 a.m. Thursday morning, the spot was viewed millions of times within a few hours. Its reach was extended dramatically as it was picked up as a news story and played nationally on the Today Show, ESPN and on broadcast media around the country.  “The Chicago Cubs are a great American story,” said SCC Managing Partner, Jim Stadler. “It goes way beyond Chicago. The Cubs are a global brand at this point and winning it all this year is a source of joy and inspiration for millions of people.” SCC’s work on for the Cubs also included the World Series Parade and celebration in Chicago. “Sleep is going to have to wait,” said Molly Gilles, SCC Senior Account Executive. “But this is all so exciting, you want to soak up every minute of it.” “We began this journey with the Cubs four seasons ago,” said Michael Dorich, SCC Creative Director. “We’ve been bleeding Cubby blue every day working with this great team and absolutely loving it. To have the Cubs bring home a World Series Championship is more than we could ask for – we couldn’t be more proud.” About Schafer Condon Carter Schafer Condon Carter (SCC) is an independent integrated creative agency that delivers seamless brand content across an infinite set of consumer touch points for its clients.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Pigging Company HPS Appoints VP Technology Solutions Pigging Company HPS Appoints VP Technology Solutions Posted on November 4, 2016 by Top News US Full Feed in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer New Role Will Support Continued Expansion in the US Nottingham, UK (PRWEB UK) 4 November 2016 HPS Product Recovery Solutions, the leading global specialist in liquid product recovery (pigging) and transfer systems, has appointed Dennis Stewart as VP Technology Solutions in the US. The company, which delivers best-in-class pigging technology to food, beverage, homecare, cosmetics, paint and other industries which process liquids, introduced the new position to increase sustainable, strategic growth and development throughout the region. Growing US Customer Base HPS selected Dennis after an in-depth, systematic and rigorous selection procedure. With over 15 years’ experience in process automation, Dennis’s skills perfectly complement their existing expertise. In addition, HPS previously employed Dennis in the early days of the business, so he already has a detailed understanding of the company’s technology. Gilbert Murphy, CEO of HPS commented, “Dennis is an outstanding engineer with extremely valuable experience in process automation. An increasing number of companies which process or pump liquids are deploying our systems to reduce waste, increase efficiency and environmental sustainability. Dennis will help us continue to provide high quality solutions to our growing US customer base.” Bright Future Since it started in 1995, HPS has developed a market-leading position in liquid product recovery, liquid transfer and automation. Dennis is looking forward to helping with the continued growth and development of the company in the US. Dennis commented, “I’m really excited to be back. With the best technology in the industry and a great team of people, HPS has a bright future. The company has almost quadrupled in size since I was last with them a few years ago. There’s real momentum in the business.” Problem Solving Technology Sustainability, waste reduction and increasing profitability are high on the agenda of most companies. HPS’s pigging technology helps companies towards their financial, operational and sustainability goals by recovering residual liquids from pipelines. So rather than flushing these useable liquids away, HPS customers can sell or further process them in the usual way. At the same time, the systems speed up processing and cut back on water and chemical usage. This results in high return on investment for HPS clients. Dennis concluded, “I really enjoy delivering value to businesses by solving their problems, and being at HPS enables me to excel at this. One of the things I’m most looking forward to is catching up with many long-standing customers, as well as new clients.” About HPS Founded in 1995, HPS Product Recovery Solutions increases its customers’ profitability by maximising product yields, reducing waste, increasing sustainability and improving efficiency. This is achieved through customised liquid distribution, transfer and product recovery (pigging) solutions. With a wide range of customers throughout the world, HPS has successfully installed more than 1,200 solutions. These include projects for multinational corporations such as Unilever, P&G, Akzo Nobel, Boots, The Coca Cola Company, Campbells Soups, Benjamin Moor, Nestle Purina, Mars, Kraft Foods, as well as many smaller independent businesses. The company’s key markets are the food and drink, cosmetics and personal care, household products, chemicals, paint and pet food processing industries.

Tata, which was at number 4 in 2015 and number 5 in 2014, is ranked at number 7 in India’s Most Attractive Brands 2016 study, carried out by Trust Research Advisory (TRA) and based on primary research conducted on close to 3,000 consumers across 16 cities. However, the ranking was done prior to October 24, when Cyrus Mistry was ousted as the Chairman of Tata group. This year, top the three places were occupied by LG, followed by Sony and Samsung Mobiles, the study said. The fourth placewas bagged by Honda while Samsung ranked fifth. While top five most attractive brands were dominated by foreign firms, homegrown firms Bajaj, Tata and Maruti Suzuki were ranked sixth, seven and eight respectively. Airtel and Nokia took the ninth and tenth spot respectively. In the food and beverage (F&B) category, Amul topped the list out of a total of 156 brands, the report said. Over all, Amul was the 32nd most attractive brand this year. In the sub-category of FMCG diversified, Patanjali pipped Hindustan Unilever (HUL) to be the most the attractive brand. Top five most attractive brands in this category are Patanjali, HUL, Nirma, Emami and Procter & Gamble (P&G). This year’s research was conducted among consumer-influencers across 16 cities, and generated nearly 5 million data points and 10,000 brands, making it the most intensive study on brand attractiveness across the globe.

Could Cincinnati become the city that sleeps better? Anne Saker , asaker@enquirer.com 6:48 p.m. EDT November 3, 2016 Buy Photo Rhinomed's nasal stent comes in two versions: Mute, left, to reduce snoring, and Turbine, for athletes. (Photo: The Enquirer/Anne Saker)Buy Photo An Australian company has planted its U.S. office in Over-the-Rhine with hopes of soon building a staff and a local manufacturing plant dedicated to the belief that the solution to your snoring problem is a little plastic gizmo that you stick up your nose at night. “We could have gone to New York, y’know, the city that never sleeps,” said Michael Johnson, president and chief executive officer of Rhinomed. “But we want to make Cincinnati the city that sleeps better.” Rhinomed of Melbourne, Australia, landed in Cincinnati a year ago with plans to expand in the U.S. market with two versions of its patented nasal stent – for athletes and for sleepers. The company’s website offers the cheeky promise: “Divorce Lawyers Hate it.” Johnson and Shane Duncan, Rhinomed’s vice president of global sales and marketing, said they hope to find property in Southwest Ohio in the next year to build a plant run with robotics, then Rhinomed will bring over at least some manufacturing from China. Bad sleep's a public-health problem Rhinomed’s research shows their stents can open nasal passages and increase airflow as much as 38 percent. More air through the nose can keep a sleeper from mouth breathing, which creates the condition that generates window-rattling snores – driving bed partners into other rooms just to get some sleep. This year, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared insufficient sleep a public health problem. A 2011 CDC survey found that nearly half of Americans report that they snore. It’s not an easy problem to solve. A snorer should seek medical attention to rule out obstructive sleep apnea, where the airway gets blocked during sleep and the sleeper temporarily stops breathing. “Our research is showing that 75 percent of users report getting more air and having their snoring reduced,” Johnson said. The Rhinomed technology is different because the stents can be adjusted for fit, and each stent has a gripper pad that keeps the device in place. Rhinomed first tried its technology with people who need maximum air flow while awake: athletes. That product is called Turbine. U.S. cyclist Kristin Armstrong wore a Turbine while racing to win a gold medal at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. British champion Chris Froome wore a Turbine in three Tour de France victories, and Froome now is a Rhinomed adviser – “that’s why the Turbine is yellow,” Johnson said, in homage to the yellow jersey wore by the leader in the world's most famous bike race. Using a slightly softer polymer than for Turbine, Rhinomed developed Mute, for sleep. Last year, the British chain Boots added Mute to its more than 2,500 pharmacies through the United Kingdom. To roll out the product, Rhinomed gave Mute to the loudest snorer in the United Kingdom, who clocked in at 111 decibels, equal to a low-flying aircraft. After she used the device, her husband proclaimed that he’d finally gotten a few nights of uninterrupted sleep. This year, Rhinomed has sold Mute in the United States through Walgreens and Duane Reade. Each device can be used up to 10 nights. Mute and Turbine come in packs of three, sized small, medium or large, for $27.50. A "starter pack" with one of each size, is $19.95. Growth, Johnson said, has been explosive, and the company’s annual revenue for 2015 was $1.01 million. The idea of nasal stents for snoring is not new, said Dr. Ann Romaker, associate professor of medicine at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine and director of UC Medical Center’s Sleep Medicine Center. “The problem is that many noses are tender,” she said. “I like whatever the patient is comfortable with and is willing to use on a regular basis. I don’t think there’s a one size fits all with any device. Some people do better with Breathe-Right strips, but some people get adhesive burns from that. I think it’s wonderful to have a variety of options.” Next steps for the company When Rhinomed officials decided to open an office in the United States, they looked at both coasts but decided they wanted to be in the middle of the country. At about the same time, Duncan and his wife moved to Cincinnati so that she could take a job with biotech startup Enable Injections, which makes wearable injection devices. Enable Injections is a portfolio company of CincyTech, which is housed in the same Over-the-Rhine building as Cintrifuse. Duncan met Cintrifuse officials, and he and Johnson said they realized Cincinnati was where they wanted Rhinomed to be. “Cintrifuse exists to nurture companies like us,” Johnson said. “We don’t know anywhere else where in the first months, we could talk with people from Kroger or Procter & Gamble or Children’s Hospital.” Naashom Marx, Cintrifuse’s director of customer connections, said Rhinomed probably won’t be in the Union Hall for long. “Definitely, we’re just a launch pad. We don’t expect them here for five years. We hope to be able to find that next spot for them.” The company officials said they’re ready for their product to shake up sleep. “Retailers are starting to wake up to the sleep market. Pharmacists are starting to wake up,” Johnson said. “The sleep area is hot.” 152 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2eYf28A TOP VIDEOS Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 Use-of-force expert: 'The actions of Ray Tensing were justified' 0:50 Which stores are opening, closing Thanksgiving Day 0:34 \u0022I can't wait to see Tensing on the stand\u0022 0:55 Cincinnati Police Criminalist: Tensing 'seemed nervous or afraid' 2:59 Crime lab: No evidence on Tensing’s boots that he was dragged 4:07 Alternate juror in Ray Tensing trial has been dismissed 1:24 Born in Cincinnati, celebrated around the world: An anthem that unites us 3:39 Inside Prep Sports 360: Colerain Football prepares for playoffs 5:05 JP Macura looks ahead to the season 2:24
