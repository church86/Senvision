He expects that once ASEAN or The Association of Southeast Asian Nations becomes more integrated, production models and market strategy will be gradually transformed. "I strongly believe that the ASEAN business community must prepare a regional strategic plan to cover the ASEAN market," Suh said in a recent interview. "The business community needs to keep in mind that a country-based approach will more likely lead to more competition. And eventually, this will lead to a loss in market share." To adapt to market changes, he pointed out that several big companies have already adopted new strategies to get the upper hand in the 10-member economic bloc. U.S.-headquartered multinational consumer goods manufacturer P&G is a case in point. "P&G has already implemented regional sales marketing for one of its main products, shampoo," he said. He explained that P&G has divided the ASEAN market into three groups based on income, not on country — in large cities, small- and mid-sized cities, and rural areas — and introduced three different brands tailored for each market segment. For example, the firm sells Pantene Premium for high-end customers in top cities across ASEAN, Rejoice shampoo for middle-income households in small- and mid-sized cities and another sold in disposable bag in rural areas. "This is based on their regional marketing strategy of the income threshold of consumers across ASEAN rather than different countries," he said. Another example is what the Japanese camera manufacturer, Nikon, is doing at a special economic zone in Savannakhet, a city in western Laos. "Nikon cameras used to be manufactured mainly in Thailand. Since 2014, however, Nikon has diversified its production base by opening a factory in Savannakhet to take over part of Thailand production. Seamless logistic movements and lower trade barriers made this possible," he said. Lastly, the ASEAN expert focused on a strategy in Indonesia adopted by Lotte Mart, the retail arm of Korea's conglomerate Lotte Group. "This retailer has sold various private-label goods supplied by various Indonesian manufacturers based on OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer)," he said. "I think this company may look for more suppliers not only from Indonesia, but also from other ASEAN member states," he added. "This can be seen as a strategy targeting the whole of ASEAN, not just one country." These ASEAN-wide strategies in his view can be also utilized by micro small- and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), which are the backbone of the ASEAN economy. "If those firms are able to formulate their own ASEAN regional strategy, the AEC will provide a great opportunity for them to move up to middle-level sized businesses, and middle-level sized businesses could advance to the level of big corporations," he said. The AEC, launched at the end of last year, is an agreement among 10 ASEAN member nations to create a single market with a free flow of goods, capital and skilled labor in the region by 2025. AEC integration means that all barriers, including those on trade and investment, will be removed, and there will be more cohesion in the ASEAN region. "Korean firms should try to see both the forest and the trees and to take a think regional, act local strategy to find an optimal place for a regional production base to cover the entire ASEAN market," Suh said. The ambassador called for ASEAN member nations to make concerted efforts to coordinate policies in a balanced manner. "If ASEAN wishes to become a real driving force for the global economy, the member states should continue their endeavours of harmonising national policies with the regional ones under AEC Blueprint 2025," he said. kjk@ktimes.com   'Romantic Doctor' tops 20 percent view...

Led by Simone Biles and Katie Ledecky, they won 61 medals, enough to put them at the top of the overall standings, behind China and Great Britain, and more than 25 million Americans turned on their televisions every night to watch them do it.      PHOTO 1 2 3 4 5 Simone Manuel -- REUTERS 1 2 3 4 5 Katie Ledecky -- AFP 1 2 3 4 5 Claressa Maria Shields -- AFP 1 2 3 4 5 Alex Morgan -- REUTERS 1 2 3 4 5 Simone Biles -- REUTERS    RELATED STORIES The Good Fight: Justin Bartha joins The Good Wife spin-off Gilmore Girls star Scott Patterson on ‘chemistry’ with Lauren Graham, biggest revival ‘regret’ HBO renews Westworld, Divorce, and Insecure Cash Cab Season 2 features celebrities Goodbye Russell, Vaughn, and Cohen Sponsors also paid dearly to reach that audience -- which, like Team USA’s medal-winners, skews female -- and NBC said it will make a profit on these games. American women’s ability to win and willingness to watch is a singularity in big-time sports. The same audience doesn’t tune in for non-Olympic sports, in spite of the major leagues’ best efforts. Women’s professional sports in the US continue to struggle. And the Olympic athletes who capture the nation’s attention during the games have a small fraction of the financial opportunities that accrue to male sports stars. The Olympics work for women -- and for sponsors, such as Procter & Gamble Co., who are eager to reach them -- for a lot of reasons that are hard to replicate. Prime-time network television caters to women in general, and the Olympics’ emphasis on pageantry and personality creates good, competitive drama. Add the patriotism of global competition on a four-year cycle, said Neal Pilson, who ran CBS Sports for almost two decades, and you’ve got appointment television. “The sports that are in the Olympics, they’re not being watched because they’re sports, they’re being watched because they’re for flag, for country, for young athletes who strive for four years -- you know the stories,” Pilson said. Women made up 55% of the audience for the Rio 2016 Games, a proportion that, according to NBC, has been steady for two decades. The Winter Olympics chart even better with women, because figure skating is so popular. Men and women haven’t watched the Olympics in equal proportions since 1992, according to data from NBC. It’s an attractive demographic, and companies tailor their advertising accordingly. Procter & Gamble came up with the “Proud Sponsor of Mom” campaign ahead of the games. Visa, Inc. made one ad that featured athletes car-pooling to Rio de Janeiro and another that starred married Olympians Ashton Eaton and Brianne Thiesen-Eaton in mock domestic competition. “There’s a logic to all this,” Pilson said. “Not only will women watch certain programming, but if American athletes are doing well, more women will watch. Very smart people spend a huge amount of money based on this premise.” Even though women have made up more than half the viewing audience for decades, Olympics television programming didn’t favor female athletes until recently. Women received more than half the airtime for the first time during NBC’s broadcast of the London 2012 Olympics. This summer, women were featured 60% of the time. “We take great pride in knowing that no one devotes more broadcast network prime time coverage to women’s sports,” said Jim Bell, executive producer of NBC Olympics, in an e-mail. “Our goal is always the same: Show the most compelling television.” Winning is appealing, so NBC may simply be following the medals. The success in women’s sports is a testament to Title IX, which radically improved the infrastructure for female athletes, and the incentives -- college scholarship, anyone? -- to succeed. “It doesn’t surprise me that we would be dominant globally. We’re a well-resourced country with a big population, and we’ve made women’s sports a priority,” said Val Ackerman, commissioner of the Big East conference. In victory, Team USA’s women gave NBC the kinds of historic moments and emotional storylines for which Olympic telecasts are famous. Biles established herself as one of the best gymnasts in history; Ledecky set two world records en route to four golds and one silver medal, the best performance by an American woman in a single Olympics. Simone Manuel became the first African-American to win a gold medal in an individual swimming event. Sarah Robles won America’s first medal in weightlifting in 16 years, Claressa Shields was the first American to defend a medal in boxing and Allyson Felix became the most-decorated female track-and-field athlete in US Olympic history. The same kind of storytelling doesn’t translate to long league seasons, either for women’s sports or men’s. In the major leagues, stars are celebrities and often multimillionaires, with careers that don’t lend themselves to the Olympic-style mini-biopic. If marketers really want to reach women, they have to get more creative, said Amy Trask, former chief executive officer of the Oakland Raiders and author of the new book, You Negotiate Like a Girl. “More sophisticated and sensible strategies are needed than ‘shrink it and pink it,’” she said. The majority of money in professional sports is made by selling broadcast rights, and while the US women’s soccer team has sold out exhibition games, there’s been little audience for women’s sports on television. Women don’t tend to watch TV when sports are on -- during the day on weekends. In prime-time, research suggests women gravitate toward entertainment over sports. This creates a chicken-or-egg problem. Outside the Olympics, the biggest sponsors largely ignore female athletes. But without investment, it’s hard to create a critical mass of fans. Companies are missing a chance to stand out, said Dominic Curran, CEO of sports marketing agency Synergy. “More brands should be looking at the opportunity in women’s sport,” he said. “People have to take the plunge, not based on the numbers but around the opportunity to talk to what is potentially a huge audience.” -- Bloomberg E-mail | Print |     From / email :     To :     E-mail (required) :     Message :     Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.    MORE STORIES Kampai: The Japanese make wine Potatoes are not the enemy 300 years of history in one meal The return of a little princess These 10 paintings just sold for $378.75 million Joining in the journey of struggling artists Art&Culture (11/23/16) Ariana Grande wins top American Music award Independent films dominate this year’s MMFF The Good Fight: Justin Bartha joins The Good Wife spin-off    MOST READ    MOST E-MAILED 1.

Published on August 26, 2016. A promotional poster for Oreo's live-stream event Credit: Tmall Most Popular To launch a double-chocolate Oreo flavor in China, Mondelez tapped two popular singers to ham it up in a live stream. One star, Da Zhangwei, had cookies shoved into his mouth while he sang Oreo's ingredient list to the tune of a love song. Fans were asked whether the other singer, Xue Zhiqian, should eat an Oreo smothered with fermented bean curd and wasabi. They voted no; he did it anyway. The blend of celebrity and goofy antics hit the sweet spot: The show got 4.5 million unique live views when it aired early this month on four Alibaba platforms, according to Dentsu's Carat, which was behind the campaign. Live streaming has exploded in China in the past year; in 2015, it was a $1.8 billion industry, according to Huachuang Securities, which predicted it could expand to $15.9 billion by 2020. And more advertisers are trying it, including P&G, Adidas and Sony. Marketers' efforts range from straightforward (store tours, product demonstrations) to bizarre, elaborate pieces of performance art. Condom brand Durex promised a live show with 50 couples in bed; they performed calisthenics and snacked on bananas, but there was no actual hanky panky, which annoyed viewers. Some campaigns, like the effort from Oreo and Carat, tap directly into the mania for online shopping in China, the world's biggest e-commerce market and the biggest internet market, with 710 million people online. Over the past three weeks, Carat says, 26 million people watched the Oreo video on Alibaba's Tmall marketplace. Viewer comments and emojis streamed across the screen during Oreo's event Credit: Carat The buddy humor was designed to promote Oreo's playful brand image and its new flavor, called Double Enjoyment. People could click a buy button on their mobile screen to drop the Oreos into their shopping cart. The live broadcast set a sales record for Oreo on Tmall, the agency said, without divulging specific numbers. Money and human connections Live streaming is at the intersection of a few Chinese trends. "Young Chinese consume a lot of video compared to the U.S.," says R.K. Mani, managing director for international clients at Carat China. Plus, "it's live, it's interactive, it's reality content, which is very popular in China. And so it's really catching people's attention." Streamers are generally ordinary people, telling stories or singing or showing scenes from their lives; attractive young women abound, dancing or acting coquettish. Advertising on the platforms is still in the early stages, and the industry is monetized mostly with virtual gifts from viewers to online hosts. Using mobile payments, people can send virtual flowers -- even virtual yachts -- to their favorite hosts. That gets transformed into real money, and the platforms take a cut. The exchange of money is driving interest. But there may also be social factors behind why live streaming really caught on here. China has a huge population of migrant workers living far from home, says Amber Liu, CEO of local agency Amber Communications. They're searching for connections online, as are young people who grew up as only children under the one-child policy. Live streaming is "a new and very important form of human connection," said Mr. Liu, whose agency has done live streaming work for Adidas. Related Stories Tampons Never Really Caught On In China. Will That Ever Change? In China, Brands Are Casting More Two-Child Families in Ads The State of Chinese Social Media in 2016: What You Need to Know China's platforms seem to get more interaction than Silicon Valley's; viewers' comments, and emojis, often stream right over the videos, and hosts react to gifts and comments in real time. There are dozens of local live streaming sites including Huajiao, Bilibili, Ingkee and YY. Internet giants like Alibaba and Tencent have invested in the area. A note of caution China's government is keeping a close eye on live content; the Cyberspace Administration of China pushed for stricter rules on live streaming, including full-time monitoring. There have been penalties for hosts and platforms accused of broadcasting pornographic or violent content. In May, in perhaps the oddest internet regulation of all time, authorities even banned seductive banana-eating. Durex's broadcast of 50 couples in April wasn't racy; it was just surreal. But soon afterward, without mentioning any brands by name, the anti-pornography office said on its microblog that it was concerned about vulgar marketing on webcast platforms and urged internet companies to "resist unhealthy content." For most brands, crossing the line probably isn't a huge risk. And some in advertising argue that more regulated content might even make the live streaming space safer for brands. But there are other factors that give some advertisers pause. They can't control users' comments, which are broadcast live and often stream across the screen in China, right on top of the image. That means any negative chatter will be front and center. "You have to be more cautious about what you are bringing to the brand," said Christina Liang, client general service manager for MediaCom in Beijing. "Since the nature of it is live, there's always more risk compared to other campaigns." A few more examples of live-streaming campaigns in China: -- To promote the ZX Flux shoe, which can be customized, Adidas live-streamed a graffiti artist doing a portrait of the sneaker. He changed his design and patterns according to the requests of people watching live via Bilibili. The campaign was from Amber Communications. (The agency's CEO says agencies should be working harder to find a strong brand connections in their live streaming campaigns; otherwise their efforts "can just seem like TV shopping channels," with somebody on a screen selling something.) -- For a 4th of July event for American brands selling on Alibaba's Tmall platform, Macy's took Chinese consumers on a virtual tour of its 34th Street store in Manhattan. Macy's, which is closing 100 stores, partnered with Alibaba to test e-commerce in China starting last year. -- China's Xiaomi showed off the battery life of its Mi Max phablet with a live stream on Bilibili that lasted 19 days, until the battery finally died. "It was touted as a 'boring live stream,' as technically, nothing much happened," a spokeswoman said. But the quirkiness drew viewers, and the brand says 39.5 million people checked it out. ~ ~ ~ CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said Amber Communications, part of China's Leo Digital Network, did live-streaming work for Sony. An agency called Carnivo, also part of Leo, did the Sony work.

Published on August 26, 2016. Target associates pitched in to help victims of the Louisiana floods. Credit: Target Most Popular Following historic floods in Louisiana, several marketers are pumping up their relief efforts. Brands including Target, Walmart, Starbucks and Tide have all contributed in recent days. Earlier this month, epic rainfall flooded the area with over 6.9 trillion gallons of water. Minneapolis, Minn.-based Target, which has six stores and over 1,000 staffers in the Baton Rouge area and other affected areas, has pitched in with volunteers and distribution of water and giftcards to local nonprofits. The retailer has also donated $100,000 each to the Salvation Army and American Red Cross. Related Stories National TV 'News' Scores an Epic Fail for an Epic Flood in Louisiana Similarly, Bentonville, Ark.-based Walmart announced recently that its foundation will be giving $1 million to various nonprofits including the Greater Baton Rouge Food Bank in support. In total, the retail chain is committing $1.5 million for food and supplies. "We have been working closely with nonprofit partners, first responders, elected officials and governmental organizations to learn how we can use our strengths to help," said Kathleen McLaughlin, president of the Walmart Foundation, in a statement. Last week, Tide, which is owned by Procter & Gamble, sent its Loads of Hope truck to Baton Rouge in order to collect, wash and dry laundry free of charge for victims affected by the floods. P&G also handed out cleaning products including Mr. Clean and Swiffer. Duracell has also sent its truck with batteries and a charging station. Starbucks donated $100,000 to the American Red Cross, the coffee chain said recently. The brand encouraged customers and employees to text "LAFLOODS" to 90999 in order to donate $10 to the relief fund. Some brands have taken their efforts in an atypical direction. Pizza Hut, for example, started a GoFundMe page asking for contributions to help staffers affected by the tragedy. The restaurant chain, which is owned by $13.1 billion Yum Brands, has received nearly $8,000 of its $25,000 funding goal thus far. In addition, the Ad Council and GSD&M recently unveiled a black-and-white ad, "Our Turn," in response to the disaster, which is the country's worst since 2012's Hurricane Katrina. The film, which includes a voiceover from Matthew McConaughey, directs viewers to OurTurntoHelp.org.

CNG hose hooked up to tank of a Kane tractor at the Gain cng station in Dupont.Warren Ruda / The Citizens' Voice Image Gallery for Natural gas station opens in Pittston Twp. Lightbox link Lightbox link Lightbox link   PITTSTON TWP. — Chris Hayes, a truck driver for Kane Is Able, plowed through a ribbon and filled up at a new compressed natural gas station that officially opened on Thursday in Pittston Township. U.S. Gain, a compressed natural gas provider, partnered with Canadian American Transport to open the station at 429 state Route 315. The clean fuel station was constructed to provide Canadian American Transport alternative fuel for its growing fleet of compressed natural gas trucks, but it’s also open to the public and can be used by other companies such as Kane is Able based in Taylor. Larry Catanzaro, senior director of transportation for Kane Is Able, said the company has six compressed natural gas trucks and having the station so close is a big help. When Kane Is Able officials initially bought the natural gas trucks in 2014, Catanzaro said they were filling up in Kirkwood, New York, and that was quite a haul. Now, drivers can use the station in Pittston Township as well as another compressed natural gas station at Procter & Gamble in Mehoopany, he said. The nearest other compressed natural gas station to Pittston Township is about 20 miles away, according to a U.S. Gain official. Catanzaro said he believes compressed natural gas trucks are “probably the future of the industry” because natural gas contains less carbon than diesel. “Fuel prices are a lot lower than diesel. Right now, they are at an equilibrium, but I’m sure that will change in time,” Catanzaro said. “They’re better for the environment.” Jonny Benner, a driver for Core-Mark in Wilkes-Barre, also filled up on Thursday at the new station. Dean Stapleton, manager of alternative fuels for Penske Truck Leasing — which leases trucks to Core-Mark, said a number of customers in Northeastern Pennsylvania like to use compressed natural gas trucks. Stapleton praised the new station’s fast-fill capabilities. The station also has fleet card acceptance capabilities. “This station is an ideal location,” Stapleton said. “Gain has a great reputation for providing a solid station with very high flow rates. One of the things that is important to the driver is to be able to get in and out of the station quickly.” Anne Butler, U.S. Gain business development manager, said this is the fourth of five Gain clean fuel stations to open in partnership with Canadian American Transport, which is converting nearly a third of its 350 trucks to compressed natural gas. The first two stations opened in Canada and the third in Charlotte, North Carolina. The fifth station, currently under construction, will be located in Laredo, Texas. By converting more than 100 trucks to compressed natural gas, Butler said Canadian American Transport is reducing emissions and creating fuel price stability. “We look forward to leveraging the advantages of this new station not only with CAT, but other CNG users as well,” Butler said. “Our goal is to meet the increasing demand for CNG by providing the necessary infrastructure to support an international network of compressed natural gas fueling stations throughout the United States and Canada.” The new station brings the total number of public compressed natural gas stations in Pennsylvania to 44, said Tony Bandiero, executive director of Eastern Pennsylvania Alliance for Clean Transportation. Bandiero commended Canadian American Transport for beginning to convert its fleet from diesel fuel to compressed natural gas. “It takes courage and a vision to make big changes in the business and CAT definitely has both as they see the potential for this underutilized fuel resource,” Bandiero said. “In addition to being a great opportunity for CAT, this new CNG station symbolizes ample economic benefits for our community.”   dallabaugh@citizensvoice.com 570-821-2115 We welcome user discussion on our site, under the following guidelines: To comment you must first create a profile and sign-in with a verified DISQUS account or social network ID.

Home > News By Company > Market Reports Center Tweet   Over-the-Counter Drug Market Size, Share, Trends, Growth and Analysis To 2020 OTC drugs are medicines that can be bought without a prescription from a doctor because the US FDA considers them safe for use without medical supervision. (EMAILWIRE.COM, August 26, 2016 ) Technavio Announces the Publication of its Research Report Global Over-The-Counter (OTC) Drug Market 2016-2020 Technavio recognizes the following companies as the key players in the global over-the-counter (OTC) drug market: GSK, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Bayer HealthCare, and Sanofi. Other Prominent Vendors in the market are: Abbott, Achelios Therapeutics, American Health, Amgen, Arena Pharmaceuticals, AstraZeneca, BioGaia, Bristol Myers Squibb, Bukwang Pharmaceutica, Chr. Hansen, Cipla, CoLucid, Daiichi Sankyo, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, DSM, Eisai, Eli Lilly, EMS, Euradite, Friggs, Genomma Lab Internacional, Glanbia, Herbalife, Himalaya Drug Company, Hypermarcas, Immune Pharmaceuticals, Innovative Med Concepts, Mcneil consumer healthcare, Mead Johnson, Merck, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma, NeurAxon, Omega Pharma, OptiNose¸ Pain Therapeutics, Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser, SAVA, Sigma Pharmaceuticals, Sun Pharma, Taisho Pharmaceuticals, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Teva Pharmaceuticals, UCB, Unifarma Global Consumer healthcare, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, and Vida Laboratories. Browse full report with TOC@ https://marketreportscenter.com/reports/356386/global-wet-fire-sprinkler-systems-market-2016-2020 Commenting on the report, an analyst from Technavios team said: Promotion and marketing initiatives will be a key trend for market growth. Vendors in this market are spending heavily on promotional activities targeted at both the healthy population and those with illnesses. They are trying to build a larger consumer base through marketing campaigns and activities through different media platforms. Marketing strategies for OTC products are very important, especially since these products lose the patent and enter the generic market, resulting in competition. According to the report, one of the key drivers for market growth will be rise in self-medication. The growing healthcare costs and an increase in the older population demand the need for better accessibility and affordability of healthcare services. Self-medication with non-prescription drugs play an important role in this and help in improving the accessibility and cost-benefits of healthcare services. Apart from this, the increase in self-care and self-medication is influenced by factors such as lifestyle, socioeconomic factors, and easy accessibility of drugs. Further, the report states that presence of counterfeit drugs will be a challenge for the market. The sale of counterfeit OTC drugs in the market is increasing, and this problem is usually unreported to the regulatory authorities in majority of the cases. For instance, in April 2014, it was reported that over 2 million counterfeit drugs were seized from France, which included about 1 million packets of fake aspirin, which contained sugar in place of the API. It is estimated that counterfeit drugs account for 10% of the global market, as compared to 1% in the developed world, and the market for these drugs is on a rise. In the US, allergy OTC drugs are among the most counterfeited. Similarly, in 2015, over $100,000 worth fake medicines from the Philippines drugs market were seized. The study was conducted using an objective combination of primary and secondary information including inputs from key participants in the industry. The report contains a comprehensive market and vendor landscape in addition to a SWOT analysis of the key vendors.

Operated by U.S. Gain, natural gas offers a cleaner, more cost-effective alternative to petroleum. Image Gallery for New CNG station opens in Pittston Twp. Lightbox link Lightbox link Lightbox link PITTSTON TWP. — Chris Hayes, a truck driver for Kane Is Able, plowed through a ribbon and filled up at a new compressed natural gas station, officially opening the station Thursday. U.S. Gain, a compressed natural gas provider, partnered with Canadian American Transport to open the station at 429 Route 315 near the intersection of Interstate 81. The clean fuel station was constructed to provide Canadian American Transport alternative fuel for its growing fleet of compressed natural gas trucks, but it also opened to the public 24/7 and can be used by other companies such as Taylor-based Kane Is Able. Larry Catanzaro, senior director of transportation for Kane Is Able, said the company has six compressed natural gas trucks and having the station so close is a big help. When Kane Is Able officials initially bought the natural gas trucks in 2014, Mr. Catanzaro said they were filling up in Kirkwood, New York, and that was quite a haul. Now, drivers can use the station in Pittston Twp. as well as another compressed natural gas station at Procter & Gamble in Washington Twp., Wyoming County. Mr. Catanzaro said he believes compressed natural gas trucks are “probably the future of the industry” because natural gas contains less carbon than diesel. “Fuel prices are a lot lower than diesel. Right now, they are at an equilibrium, but I’m sure that will change in time,” he said. “They’re better for the environment.” Jonny Benner, a driver for Core-Mark in Wilkes-Barre, filled up Thursday at the new station in minutes. Dean Stapleton, manager of alternative fuels for Penske Truck Leasing, which leases trucks to Core-Mark, said a number of customers in Northeast Pennsylvania like to use compressed natural gas trucks. Mr. Stapleton praised the new station’s fast-fill capabilities. The station also has fleet card acceptance capabilities. Anne Butler, U.S. Gain business development manager, said this is the fourth of five Gain clean fuel stations to open in partnership with Canadian American Transport. The first two stations opened in Canada and the third in Charlotte, North Carolina. The fifth station, currently under construction, will be located in Laredo, Texas. The new station brings the total number of public compressed natural gas stations in Pennsylvania to 44, said Tony Bandiero, executive director of Eastern Pennsylvania Alliance for Clean Transportation.

X Geneva set to cut corporate tax rate by more than 10% Swiss canton faces ‘mother of all battles’ over plan to cut tax rate to 13.49 per cent Thu, Aug 25, 2016, 15:39 A rate of 13 per cent would leave Geneva with the third most attractive corporate tax system in Switzerland. Photograph: iStock         When the European Union pressured Switzerland to scrap tax breaks for foreign companies, Geneva had most to lose. Now, the canton that is home to almost 1,000 multinationals is set to use tax to burnish its appeal. Geneva will on August 30th propose cutting its corporate tax rate to 13.49 per cent from 24.2 per cent, according to sources. For an interim period of five years, the rate will be a slightly higher 13.79 per cent, the sources said. While that’s 2.2 percentage points higher than the average preferential rate currently offered to many foreign firms, the new regime will improve the Swiss city’s competitive position, according to Credit Suisse Group. “I could see Geneva going up very high in the ranks,” said Thierry Boitelle, a lawyer at Bonnard Lawson in the city. “International companies will be glad to have some certainty when the new rate is finally implemented.” Like the rest of Switzerland, Geneva has been buffeted by the strong Swiss franc and concern over immigration quotas, while the demise of banking secrecy has hurt the city’s financial industry. The stakes are high for the politicians contemplating a tax rate to underpin the French-speaking canton’s allure: multinationals from Procter and Gamble to commodity trader Mercuria Energy Group account for 76,000 jobs and 40 per cent of the economy. “It’s the mother of all battles for us,” says Vincent Subilia, deputy director of international affairs and arbitration at the Geneva Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Services. “We can’t afford to lose it because the attractiveness of Geneva and the shape that our economy will take for generations to come are at risk here.” Opportunity A rate of about 13 per cent would see Geneva jump 13 places to become the third-most attractive of Switzerland’s 26 cantons, trailing only Zug and Zurich, according to a study by Credit Suisse. ADVERTISEMENT “Geneva and the western part of Switzerland will be even more attractive for firms, especially compared to France,” said Thomas Ruehl, head of regional research at Credit Suisse. “We see the corporate tax reform as a big opportunity for Geneva.” France, which borders the canton to the south, east and west, has a tax rate of 33.33 per cent, according to figures published by KPMG. Within Europe, Geneva’s rate would exceed only a number of smaller economies such as our own 12.5 per cent and Montenegro, which has the region’s lowest rate of 9 per cent. That will mean Geneva competes with Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK as a low-tax jurisdiction, while it may also provide Zurich with stiffer competition for Swiss corporates, said Mr Boitelle. Still, tax alone won’t be enough to turn Geneva’s fortunes around, according to the lawyer, who highlights the need for Switzerland to resolve the issues caused by voters backing a referendum in 2014 to introduce quotas for EU migrants. “Tax reform won’t change that,” said Mr Boitelle. “Geneva’s appeal lies in a good business culture, plus quality of life, a well-educated workforce and stability. They need to come up with some kind of solution for the immigration issue.” Hole in finances The new taxation regime will also leave a projected 459 million franc (€420 million) hole in Geneva’s finances, according to some estimates. The shortfall is likely to be something close to that, said Roland Godel, a Geneva finance department spokesman, who declined to comment further on the reform before next week’s announcement. “The real challenge will be on the budget side,” said Elias Hafner, an economist at UBS Group, adding that Geneva’s higher ratio of public officials to residents than other parts of Switzerland provided scope for cuts.That’s a concern for Romain de Sainte Marie, head of the Socialist Party in Geneva’s cantonal parliament. “We need an attractive tax rate and we do want to retain most jobs in Geneva, but we must also guarantee the same level of public service,” said Mr de Sainte Marie. “For Geneva’s attractiveness, the quality of public services is just as important as the corporate tax rate.” Opposition to the new rate from left-leaning political parties will probably trigger a referendum as it would require only 500 signatures. In a March plebiscite in the neighbouring canton of Vaud, 87.1 per cent of voters backed cutting the corporate tax rate to 13.79 per cent from 21.65 per cent. That change will probably mean fewer resources to spend on theatres, museums, street-cleaning and creches in the canton’s main city, Lausanne, according to municipal councillor Florence Germond.Failure to agree on a competitive tax rate in Geneva could result in an exodus of multinationals, cutting cantonal revenue by an even greater margin, said Denis Berdoz, a partner at Baker and McKenzie in Geneva, who specialises in tax and corporate law. “They don’t really have a choice,” said Mr Berdoz. “If the companies leave, the loss could be much higher.”       Topics: Eu Mercuria Energy Group Procter and Gamble Genève Lausanne Switzerland Zug Zürich Read More US criticises Commission's stance as Apple tax ruling looms Cliff Taylor: US sets down big marker in European tax battle Talks on new US/Ireland tax treaty to focus on multinationals Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Commercial Property Solicitor entitled to damages in Anglo case Technology Clever cube makes for easier shared viewing English Soccer Ex-England player David White reveals sexual abuse by coach Economy Downbeat Philip Hammond offers little to soothe economic fears Sponsored A bank-beating foreign exchange proposition How ‘nudge theory’ can improve pension provision Black Friday: what is it and how to prepare for it Send an AdMailer Christmas card and help a homeless charity ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business CityJet pilots defer planned airline strike 19:55 Renovated Bewley’s Cafe can seat 500 customers at a time 19:39 Lidl and Aldi to hold prices in Republic despite sterling slide 19:27 Downbeat Philip Hammond offers little to soothe economic fears 18:55 European shares steady as metal prices rise 18:53 ADVERTISEMENT Most Read in Business 1 First-time buyer deposits cut to 10% as Central Bank eases mortgage rules 2 Renovated Bewley’s Cafe can seat 500 customers at a time 3 Central Bank mortgage rule change: What it means for you 4 What to do in your 20s/30s...if you don’t want to be broke in your 60s 5 Solicitor entitled to damages in Anglo case 6 Lidl and Aldi to hold prices in Republic despite sterling slide 7 Shocking revelations at Rush Credit Union are just the start 8 Thousands affected as RaboDirect axes investment funds 9 Loosening of mortgage rules will push up house prices, says Davy 10 Supermac’s goes large as profits double Never miss a story.

Yesterday's Island/Today's Nantucket News and Events for Nantucket Island Navigation Nantucket.net Nantucket Restaurants Nantucket Lodging Photo Contest Events Contact A Look Back … Folger Brothers: Not Just Coffee August 25, 2016 | Filed under: Nantucket History & People and tagged with: coffee, Henry Clay Folger, history ~ by Amy Jenness ~ Henry Clay Folger In 1849 three Folger brothers left Nantucket for the gold fields of northern California. By April of 1850 Edward Folger, age 20, Henry Folger, age 16 and James Folger, age 14, had reached the west coast of Panama after a ship voyage, rafting trip and a hike across the tip of the country. They left Panama City onboard the Pacific mail steamer Isthmus. When the brothers reached San Francisco there was only enough money for two to continue on to the mining camps. The youngest, J.A., as he was called, stayed in the city to work for his travel costs so he could join his brothers. Folger met 27-year-old entrepreneur William H. Bovee, who planned to build a mill in San Francisco and hired Folger. Bovee named his business The Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills. In a new twist for consumers used to roasting and grinding their own coffee beans, Bovee offered ready-to-brew prepackaged coffee. James saved enough money working for Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills to be able to join his brothers. When he left the city, Folger agreed to act as a Pioneer sales representative to stores catering to the miners. He gave out samples to store owners and relayed their orders to Bovee. James returned to San Francisco in 1865 and became a full partner in The Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills. In 1872, he bought out his partners and renamed the company J.A. Folger & Co. Eventually James’ brothers Edward and Henry tired of mining for gold. Edward established a San Francisco whaling business next to the Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mill and died at age 40 in Nevada from injuries sustained in a stagecoach accident. Henry returned to Nantucket and later married Eliza Jane Clark. They settled in New York City and had eight children. Among the three brothers’ children, two Folger sons would acquire great wealth building dynasties that still exist today. In June of 1889, at age 51, JA died of a heart condition. His oldest son, James A. Folger, II, age 26, had worked in the company for seven years and succeeded his father as president of J.A. Folger & Co. James II expanded the company, which sold coffee on both a wholesale and retail basis. 1898 Folgers Ad In 1901 the company’s ambitious salesman Frank P. Atha further expanded its territory into Texas. Folger’s Coffee remained under family control until 1963, when the Procter & Gamble Company of Cincinnati, OH, acquired it and began to distribute Folger’s Coffee nationally In 1969 James Folger II’s granddaughter, Abigail Folger was murdered by followers of Charles Manson. Folger Coffee changed hands once more in 2008 when the JM Smucker Company purchased it. Henry Clay Folger, Jr., born in 1857, was Henry, Sr and Eliza Jane’s oldest child. His father had not been a successful businessman, so when Henry, Jr. attended Amherst College, he paid his tuition by competing in essay contests and by borrowing the money. While at Amherst, Folger was a Phi Beta Kappa scholar who studied Latin, Greek, French German and English literature. Folger continued on to Columbia Law School. And after passing the bar exam, he went to work at the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey as a statistical clerk in 1881. His prowess at mathematics and his methodical tracking of the company’s oil production attracted the admiration of his employer. He was chairman of the manufacturing committee by 1899, and became a trusted confidante to John D. Rockefeller. Folger and Rockefeller resisted the anti-trust movement favored by President Theodore Roosevelt. But in 1911 a US Supreme Court ruling broke up the company and Folger became president of the Standard Oil Company of New York. By that time Folger was a wealthy man and a significant shareholder at Standard Oil and its subsidiaries. He retired as president in 1923, but stayed at Standard Oil another five years as the company’s first chairman of the board. Folger and his wife, Emily, a Vassar graduate and Shakespeare scholar, used their great wealth to collect Shakespearean documents and by the time he died Henry had amassed the largest collection of first folio editions of Shakespearean plays. The couple had no children and committed their energy and a considerable amount of money to building their collection. The pair never discussed their holdings publicly and did not give scholars access to it. But privately they struggled with how best to care for their rare books and manuscripts. In the end, the couple built a library intended as a gift to the American people. They looked at sites in the United States and England, they even considered building their library on Nantucket. But finally settled on Washington, D.C. near the close of World War I. It took Henry nine years to purchase a city block worth of row houses between First and Second Streets. Folger immersed himself the library’s design and in 1930 helped lay a cornerstone of what would be the Folger Shakespeare Library. But he died that year after undergoing surgery. Folger left the majority of his wealth in a trust for the library and named Amherst College the trust’s administrator. The library opened in 1932 on April 23, the date believed to be William Shakespeare’s birthday. Today the Folger Shakespeare Library is considered the most important repository of material related to William Shakespeare. It holds more than 275,000 books about the playwright as well as playbills, costumes, furniture and paintings. Holdings also include 82 First Folios, the first edition of the “complete works” of Shakespeare, compiled in 1623 by two of Shakespeare’s actor friends.

You’d better read the fine print if backing Exxon Mobil and British American Tobacco isn’t your idea of doing good. The oil company accused of misleading investors by hiding evidence about climate change and Europe’s biggest cigarette maker are among the holdings of some of the 30 biggest funds that invest following environmental or social governance guidelines, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While some funds are strict about supporting only clean-energy producers, others buy securities from Big Oil to Big Tobacco along with consumer brands such as Unilever and Facebook. The wide range of holdings is the result of each institution deciding on its own what meets the ethical threshold.  Read more Oil companies spent £81m 'obstructing' climate laws, NGO says Loosening that definition has helped ethical investing grow about 80 per cent over the past five years to $223 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. “The industry hasn’t done itself many favors in making sure people understand what’s what,” said Charlie Thomas, who manages €950 million under Jupiter’s Ecology funds, which exclude oil and tobacco in favour of companies that have a solution for environmental issues.  “The challenge that we have as a sector is to be very clear with the investor so they know what they’re actually buying.

That has allowed to mushroom the number of funds saying they support companies guided by standards on environmental and social governance. There are no set criteria for how companies report performance on those metrics, and no regulator lhas set out rules.  The looseness of the system is a concern to the G20 nations, which asked a panel led by Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England to draw up a proposal for voluntary reporting standards that companies could follow if they chose.  Ethical investing has grown into a $223 billion dollar business (Bloomberg) That’s likely to offer best practices to companies and accounting firms that draw up sustainability reports and release data through organizations such as the non-profit CDP and Bloomberg. Ethical, Social and Governance (ESG) fund strategies range from excluding only companies they score the worst in their industries on specific metrics to including only the best of their class. Some seek to spur change by working as activist shareholders. A few will invest only in companies that benefit the environment. The only way to tell the difference is to look at what the fund is holding. No Simple Label “There’s not a simple label you can slap on it to solve the problem,” said Greg Elders, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in London tracking ESG data. “Clients think it’s a shortcut for seeing how sustainable a fund is.” The Bloomberg survey found the number of environmentally friendly or ESG funds has more than doubled in the past decade to about 730. Of the top 30, at least six hold oil companies. At Impax Asset Management Group, which runs a $568 million Environmental Markets fund, the number of companies that meet its rules has jumped to 1,500 from 250 in 1999, with the pool of firms eligible to be included growing to $4.1 trillion, according to Jon Forster, a portfolio manager at the firm. Investors have benefited from the diversification of green funds. The main ethical investing index, the MSCI KLD 400 Social Index, has risen more than 225 per cent from the March 2009 low, about as much as the S&P 500. The gauge includes 400 companies, with Microsoft, Procter & Gamble and Verizon having the biggest weightings.

Share this article Share 'And even now that companies are under the spotlight and seem to acknowledge that microbeads are a bad idea, they are still not making commitments that cover all their products or all kinds of plastic.' Cosmetic companies have offered a limited removal of the beads from their creams and scrubs by 2020. But Mary Creagh, who chairs the Commons environmental audit committee, said: 'A voluntary approach to phasing out plastic microbeads simply won't wash. We need a full legal ban. Microbeads are flushed into rivers and seas by the trillion where they attract toxins, threaten marine life and can reach the human food chain 'There is nothing to stop us banning these products in this country. We would like to see our Government showing leadership.' Most microbeads are made from polyethylene, which is the same material used to make plastic bags, bulletproof vests and even knee replacements. Once in the environment and seas they effectively become a magnet for toxins, such as pesticides. Eaten by fish and shellfish they can find their way into the food chain. DAILY MAIL COMMENT  They are tiny particles contained in countless bathroom products including shower gels, exfoliating scrubs and anti-ageing creams. But it is increasingly clear that microbeads, which, like plastic bags, are made of polyethylene, are a dangerous and unnecessary pollutant. Shockingly, every time someone takes a shower about 100,000 plastic particles wash into the sea, becoming a magnet for pesticides and other toxins. They are then swallowed by fish and other marine wildlife and end up on our dinner tables. The average plate of shellfish could contain 50 pieces of plastic. As this newspaper's successful campaign for a 5p charge for plastic bags showed, decisive government action can make a huge difference to the environment. Bag use is down 85 per cent since it was introduced. Some cosmetics companies are committed to phasing out microbeads by 2020. But why should we wait four years, especially when other countries are moving more quickly? The US has already introduced a ban to come into force next year, and Canada is also considering legislation. The EU appears to be dragging its heels and, in any case, will become an irrelevance post-Brexit. Given the growing weight of evidence, it is clearly time for ministers to ban this plastic poison – now. A study published in Australia last week showed for the first time that pollutants in microbeads are absorbed into the bodies of fish. As many as 100,000 are washed into the sea following a single shower. The UK daily total is put at 86 tons. Tamara Galloway, a professor at Exeter University, said: 'We find pieces of plastic in every sample of seawater we study from round the world. 'Many marine animals ingest microbeads, mistaking them for food. They can then be lodged in the animals' gut – preventing them from eating nutritious food. 'An average plate of oysters could contain up to 50 plastic particles. Most people would probably prefer not to be eating microbeads with their food.' The demand for a ban was made by a coalition including the Marine Conservation Society, Greenpeace, the Environmental Investigation Agency and Fauna & Flora International. In the joint statement, they said: 'There is huge public support for a ban on microbeads. With companies dragging their feet on this issue, it's now time for Theresa May's Government to take comprehensive action on this crucial issue by banning any microplastics in household products which could end up going down the drain and into our seas.' Environment minister George Eustice has signalled a willingness to impose a UK ban if the EU fails to step up. Giving evidence to MPs earlier this year, he said: 'We do not rule out doing it at national level.' The Cosmetic, Toiletry & Perfumery Association said manufacturers were taking steps voluntarily. Its director general, Dr Christopher Flower, said: 'A recommendation was issued by Cosmetics Europe in 2015 that such ingredients ought to be discontinued from use in products such as exfoliants and scrubs where the microbeads may ultimately end up in waterways. This course of action was chosen because it would have an impact far more quickly than waiting for any legislative ban. The European Commission is considering a ban but MPs from all parties and environmental groups want one now 'Although the date for final removal was stated at 2020, the majority of use would be discontinued long before then.' Some firms are either removing the beads or have never used them, including Unilever, Procter & Gamble, L'Oreal, Boots, Clearasil, Superdrug and Marks & Spencer. Waitrose has announced its own ban on the sale of beauty products containing the beads. Others, such as Johnson & Johnson, Estee Lauder and Elizabeth Arden, are in the process of removing them. A poll by campaign groups found more than 90 per cent of Britons support an outright ban. And 84 per cent said they would be turned off from buying a product if it was found to be polluting the oceans.

As the Mail launches a campaign to ban them, here's all you need to know about the microbeads menace  For two decades, microbeads have been used to bulk out cheap shower gel, make shampoo silky and give facial scrubs a refreshing zing. And in those 20 years, trillions upon trillions of the minuscule plastic balls have been allowed to wash down our plug holes into the oceans — wreaking havoc on marine life such as dolphins, turtles and fish and, more worryingly, making their way into the very food we eat. No consumer asked for plastic balls to be added to their daily skincare regime. No one demanded they be sprinkled liberally into Tesco own-brand toothpaste so that children unwittingly swallow plastic every time they brush their teeth. For two decades, microbeads have been used to bulk out cheap shower gel, make shampoo silky and give facial scrubs a refreshing zing In those 20 years, trillions upon trillions of the minuscule plastic balls have been allowed to wash down our plug holes into the oceans Yet introduced they were — by a cosmetics industry desperate to make their products more appealing to consumers — and their impact has been extraordinary. According to the latest estimates, up to 51 trillion tiny particles of plastic — including many from cosmetics products — have been dumped in the oceans in the past few decades. The particles are so pervasive and long-lasting that every stretch of water from the North Sea to the Pacific contains traces of plastic. Microbeads and other such plastic junk have turned regions of our once open seas into cesspools of plastic. The largest is the 'great Pacific garbage patch', a swirling current of plastic rubbish which stretches thousands of miles. Dubbed the world's biggest rubbish dump, it is made up of floating bags, bottle tops, discarded fishing nets and polystyrene chunks. And around it all, like a thick plastic soup, float microscopic particles of plastic. Finally, however, the tide seems to be turning, as an influential cross-party group of MPs calls for them to be banned. So what's the truth about microbeads? Here, we explain what they are — and how you can avoid them . . . WHAT ARE THEY? Microbeads are tiny balls of plastic which are added to a host of household and personal-care products. They vary in size, but most are between 0.001mm and 1mm. Smaller beads are used to make cosmetics and cleansers smooth and silky; larger ones help to make them more exfoliating. Sometimes they are used to add colour or a glittery appearance, or to bulk out the product. They are usually made from polyethylene — the stuff used to make plastic bags, toys, bottles and even bullet-proof vests. Others are made from oil-derived plastics such as polystyrene and polypropylene. WHAT PRODUCTS CONTAIN THEM? They are most commonly used in exfoliating scrubs and facial cleansers. The balls help to remove dead cells and dirt without feeling too rough on our skin. For instance, Johnson and Johnson's Clean and Clear Exfoliating Daily Wash contains them — as does Clinique Exfoliating Scrub. A single facial scrub wash can use up to 94,500 microbeads, while a 150ml tub of the stuff contains nearly three million. They are added to hand soap to give it a smooth texture, and to shower gels and sunblocks to help them spread easily. Microbeads are also added to some over-the-counter medicines to make them easier to swallow. They have even been used in some toothpaste as an abrasive to help remove plaque. Tesco adds them to its Steps Toothpaste — sold as a 'gentle mint toothpaste' for children aged two and under. Ironically, the tube features a happy-looking turtle swimming in the sea — turtles are one of the main victims of plastic pollution. Last year the United Nations Environment Programme claimed: 'A typical exfoliating shower gel can contain roughly as much microplastic in the cosmetic formulation as is used to make the plastic packaging it comes in.' No consumer asked for plastic balls to be added to their daily skincare regime WHEN DID THEY APPEAR? The first patents for microbeads were filed in the Sixties. But it wasn't until the Nineties that they took off. The balls replaced traditionally-used ingredients such as ground shell, silica and pumice. Manufacturers liked them because they were cheaper to make and could be mass-produced in a uniform shape. Concerns about microbeads have been growing for the past few years. In 2011, Dutch environmentalists with the North Sea Foundation began writing to manufacturers, asking them to stop using them. Since then, a growing number of marine scientists and green campaigners have called for a ban. SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? It starts when products containing microbeads are flushed down the plug hole. The spheres are so small most are not filtered out by sewage plants and instead flow into rivers and the seas. A single shower using shower gel and shampoo can result in 100,000 plastic particles being washed into the oceans, where they can float around for centuries. Dr Sue Kinsey, of the Marine Conservation Society, says: 'Once they are in the ocean, they enter the food chain.' Some of the plastic particles are devoured by animals at the bottom of the food chain — such as plankton. These tiny creatures are eaten by fish which, in turn, are hunted by birds, larger fish and seals — the plastic getting passed up the food chain with each meal. Other particles are ingested by whales. Grey whales feed on the bottom of oceans, scooping up everything from crabs to plankton. They need to eat 3,000 lb of food each day. Thanks to microbeads, they are also regularly consuming huge quantities of plastic. HOW WIDESCALE IS THE POLLUTION? Microbeads are part of the greater problem of plastic polluting our oceans. Every year, around eight million tonnes of plastic — in the form of microbeads, plastic bags, fishing gear and other debris — is washed into the seas. Most of the larger pieces of junk — the ones not eaten by whales, turtles and sea birds — are broken down by sunlight and the movement of waves into smaller and smaller pieces of plastic until they are the same size as microbeads. According to the best estimates, between 15 and 51 trillion particles of plastic are floating in the seas. That's equivalent to 2,000 particles for every one of the 7.5 billion people living on Earth. Around 1-4 per cent of all those particles are microbeads from cosmetics. No one can say for sure how many of them came from the UK. But Professor Richard Thompson, a marine scientist at Plymouth University, says around 680 tonnes of microbeads are used in cosmetic products in the UK each year. 'That's the equivalent of 30 articulated lorries full of microbeads,' he says. Not all of those microbeads will be washed into the seas. Some will be captured at sewage treatment plants and then spread with all the other sewage on farmlands. But most of them will end up in the seas. And that is just a tiny proportion compared with the rest of the world's contribution. The horrifying truth is that no one knows how much of this plastic gunk is despoiling the oceans — and no one knows the toll it is taking on wildlife and people. A single shower using shower gel and shampoo can result in 100,000 plastic particles being washed into the oceans, where they can float around for centuries WHAT HARM IS DONE TO WILDLIFE? Hundreds of marine animals, including fish, mussels, oysters, lobsters and plankton, have been shown to consume microbeads and other small particles of plastic. A study by Prof Thompson found that a third of the 500 fish he captured in the English Channel had swallowed plastic particles. He has also shown that almost every sample of water collected from the sea, or sand collected from a beach anywhere in the world, will have traces of plastic. These particles can harm animals by clogging up their digestive systems and stomachs, making them feel full when, in fact, they are actually starving. Beads of plastic are also like sponges, attracting toxins — tiny particles of poisons and pollutants such as PCB, the hormone-mimicking chemicals churned out by industry and power stations which can hang around in the air and seas for decades. PCBs have been shown to interfere with the fertility of fish, birds, turtles and shellfish. Around 90 per cent of seabirds have some plastic in their guts, researchers reported last year. And it's not just marine life that suffers. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says PCBs can cause cancer in animals and are probably carcinogenic for humans. Women exposed to high levels of PCBs before or during pregnancy can give birth to children with lowered cognitive ability, immunocompromised and motor control problems. CAN THEY GET INTO OUR BODIES? Plastic pollution is so common we are likely to be consuming plastic indirectly each time we tuck into a bowl of mussels, a plate of oysters or a fish-and-chip supper. The levels of plastic in such meals will be low — but no one can say whether microbeads and other microplastics accumulate in our bodies or are flushed out. We are exposed to plastic in the shower when using facial scrub when a dribble gets into our mouths. And if your toothpaste contains microbeads, families are swallowing plastic every time they brush their teeth. Doctors aren't yet sure what sort of health risk this may pose. 'We don't know whether it will create a human health problem, but it's better to be cautious now, rather than wait for 50 years to discover it's too late,' says Dr Kinsey. HOW CAN YOU TELL WHAT HAS THEM? You might assume microbeads would be flagged up in big letters on packaging. But they aren't. To find out whether a shower gel or exfoliating scrub contains microbeads you need to read the label — usually with a magnifying glass — to see if it contains plastic. The tell-tale words to look out for are polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene tereph-thalate (PET), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), as well as nylon. The balls replaced traditionally-used ingredients such as ground shell, silica and pumice. Manufacturers liked them because they were cheaper to make and could be mass-produced in a uniform shape WHAT IS THE UK INDUSTRY DOING? The industry claims it is taking action. The Cosmetics, Toiletry and Perfumery Association director-general Dr Chris Flower says: 'Any remaining use of plastic microbeads in wash-off products will have been phased out by 2018, two years ahead of the recommended date of 2020.' However, some companies are proceeding earlier with the voluntary ban. Procter and Gamble — owner of Pantene, Oral-B and Olay — and Estee Lauder, which owns Clinique and Origins, say they will phase out microbeads by the end of 2017. But according to campaigners, manufacturers have dragged their feet over plastic pollution. The Marine Conservation Society's Dr Kinsey says 'We would have liked them to have acted far more promptly. I know they have to find alternative formulations, but some companies seem to have found them faster than others. We'd like a blanket ban that creates a level playing field for everyone.' WHY CAN'T THEY BE BANNED NOW? The cross-party Environmental Audit Committee wants them to be banned immediately — as do marine conservation charities. And other countries have acted far more quickly. The U.S. has already introduced a ban which comes into effect from 2017. Canada and some EU countries are also seriously considering legislation. Fauna and Flora International says the UK ban should have no loopholes. 'It must include all solid microplastics used for any purpose — not just for exfoliation,' said a spokesperson. 'And it should cover all products commonly washed down the drain. This includes a wide range of cosmetic and personal care products, as well as many household cleaners.' ARE THERE ANY ALTERNATIVES?  If you don't have time to comb the back of packets for the tell-tale ingredients mentioned earlier, it's worth noting that some products don't contain microbeads. For example, Aquafresh Complete Care Extra Fresh toothpaste, Eau Thermal Avène Gentle shower gel and Boots Tea Tree & Witch Hazel Charcoal face scrub are all microbead-free. If you raid your kitchen cupboards, salt and sugar, coffee grounds and apricot kernels can all be used as microbead-free alternative scrubs.

Now, the canton that’s home to almost 1,000 multinationals is set to use tax to burnish its appeal. Geneva will on Aug. 30 propose cutting its corporate tax rate to 13.49 percent from 24.2 percent, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. For an interim period of five years, the rate will be a slightly higher 13.79 percent, said the people who asked not be named as the matter hasn’t been made public. While that’s 2.2 percentage points higher than the average preferential rate currently offered to many foreign firms, the new regime will improve the Swiss city’s competitive position, according to Credit Suisse Group AG. “I could see Geneva going up very high in the ranks,” said Thierry Boitelle, a lawyer at Bonnard Lawson in the city. “International companies will be glad to have some certainty when the new rate is finally implemented.” Like the rest of Switzerland, Geneva has been buffeted by the strong franc and concern over immigration quotas, while the demise of banking secrecy has hurt the city’s financial industry. The stakes are high for the politicians contemplating a tax rate to underpin the French-speaking canton’s allure: multinationals from Procter & Gamble Co. to commodity trader Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. account for 76,000 jobs and 40 percent of the economy. Economic Risk “It’s the mother of all battles for us,” says Vincent Subilia, deputy director of international affairs and arbitration at the Geneva Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Services. “We can’t afford to lose it because the attractiveness of Geneva and the shape that our economy will take for generations to come are at risk here.” A rate of about 13 percent would see Geneva jump 13 places to become the third-most attractive of Switzerland’s 26 cantons, trailing only Zug and Zurich, according to a study by Credit Suisse. “Geneva and the western part of Switzerland will be even more attractive for firms, especially compared to France,” said Thomas Ruehl, head of regional research at Credit Suisse. “We see the corporate tax reform as a big opportunity for Geneva.” France, which borders the canton to the south, east and west, has a tax rate of 33.33 percent, according to figures published by KPMG. Within Europe, Geneva’s rate would only exceed a number of smaller economies such as Ireland’s 12.5 percent and Montenegro, which has the region’s lowest rate of 9 percent. That will mean Geneva competes with Ireland, the Netherlands and the U.K. as a low-tax jurisdiction, while it may also provide Zurich with stiffer competition for Swiss corporates, said Boitelle.  For a QuickTake explainer on Switzerland’s people power, click here. Still, tax alone won’t be enough to turn Geneva’s fortunes around, according to the lawyer, who highlights the need for Switzerland to resolve the issues caused by voters backing a referendum in 2014 to introduce quotas for EU migrants. “Tax reform won’t change that,” said Boitelle. “Geneva’s appeal lies in a good business culture, plus quality of life, a well-educated workforce and stability. They need to come up with some kind of solution for the immigration issue.” The new taxation regime will also leave a projected 459 million-franc ($475 million) hole in Geneva’s finances, according to the people familiar. The shortfall is likely to be something close to that, said Roland Godel, a Geneva finance department spokesman, who declined to comment further on the reform before next week’s announcement. Referendum Looms “The real challenge will be on the budget side,” said Elias Hafner, an economist at UBS Group AG, adding that Geneva’s higher ratio of public officials to residents than other parts of Switzerland provides scope for cuts. That’s a concern for Romain de Sainte Marie, head of the Socialist Party in Geneva’s cantonal parliament. “We need an attractive tax rate and we do want to retain most jobs in Geneva, but we must also guarantee the same level of public service,” said de Sainte Marie. “For Geneva’s attractiveness, the quality of public services is just as important as the corporate tax rate.” Opposition to the new rate from left-leaning political parties will probably trigger a referendum as it would only require 500 signatures. In a March plebiscite in the neighboring canton of Vaud, 87.1 percent of voters backed cutting the corporate tax rate to 13.79 percent from 21.65 percent. That change will probably mean fewer resources to spend on theaters, museums, street-cleaning and creches in the canton’s main city Lausanne, according to municipal councilor Florence Germond. Failure to agree on a competitive tax rate in Geneva could result in an exodus of multinationals, cutting cantonal revenues by an even greater margin, said Denis Berdoz, a partner at Baker & McKenzie in Geneva, who specializes in tax and corporate law. “They don’t really have a choice,” said Berdoz. “If the companies leave, the loss could be much higher.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Visit the Straight Dope Message Board Search The Straight Dope How long have adult diapers been around? August 26, 2016 Dear Cecil: Incontinence products seem to be everywhere these days. When did the first diapers specifically for adults become commercially available? — Rachel Newstead Cecil replies: If they aren't everywhere yet, they will be soon. The bladder-control biz expects to waterproof more geezers than tots within the decade, as birth rates dip and the baby boom grays still further. Adult incontinence soaked up $1.8 billion in profits last year, and the market could grow nearly 50 percent by 2020. Pretty good for a business that not so long ago could hardly get anyone to admit they needed its product. Whether caused by childbirth, strenuous exercise, traumatic injury, or just plain aging, incontinence is nothing new, and ancient medical tomes reveal that folks have always sought means of keeping their downstairs dry. The Ebers Papyrus, an Egyptian text from 1550 BC, discusses the condition and methods for treatment: for men, external urine-collection devices; for women, vaginal inserts to provide compression. Over the following three-plus millennia, doctors mainly refined these concepts rather than improved on them, unless you call the 18th-century penile clamp an improvement. Meanwhile, babies had been going about their business as babies will, and parents had been using all manner of materials to keep their children’s output in check. By the end of the 1800s, mass production of the basic diapering elements — fabric squares and safety pins — was well underway. Cloth diapers would remain the norm for decades until WWII shook things up. Women working the home-front assembly lines began using diaper services rather than washing their own, and with cloth in as short supply as time was, various inventors contributed to the evolution of the disposable diaper as we now know it. While the boys were heading home from overseas to breed a record number of Americans, Johnson & Johnson was developing what would become the first disposable diapers mass-marketed in the United States. The fighting may have ended in 1945, but the Cold War was just beginning, and so was the space program. NASA learned the hard way that astronauts have the same biological needs as anyone else when Alan Shepard wet himself while waiting for the Freedom 7 launch in 1961. Extraterrestrial dominance was deemed necessary for the preservation of democracy and capitalism, and our flyboys could hardly kick Soviet keister wearing pee-stained spacesuits. At this point America’s astronauts were all men, meaning urine could thereafter be easily collected in a bag or via a sheath-tube-pouch arrangement, while a larger bag attached with adhesive took care of number two. Once NASA started putting women in orbit, though, the differences in female plumbing required new gear. The zip-up trunks first issued were soon replaced with Maximum Absorbency Garments, treated with sodium polyacrylate to absorb liquid, and these proved so effective male astronauts started wearing them too. Space-shuttle astronauts got three — one for launch, one for re-entry, and one because you never knew what might happen in space. NASA super-diapers entered the pop-cultural consciousness in 2007, you’ll recall, when former astronaut Lisa Nowak, arrested in Orlando for an alleged attempt to kidnap a woman she apparently viewed as a romantic rival, reportedly told police she’d worn them so she could make the drive to Florida from Houston nonstop. But that's all fine and good for astronauts — what about poor old grandma back on earth? Commercially available adult incontinence products were slow to arrive, in part because the embarrassing nature of the ailment made marketing a tricky task. Procter & Gamble — makers of Pampers, long the undisputed champ in babies’ disposables — introduced Attends Incontinent Briefs in 1978, but these wound up being sold mainly to hospitals after print ads failed to reel in many retail consumers. A new kid in diaper-town would change all that. The same year Attends made their debut, Kimberly-Clark began manufacturing Huggies, the first true competitor to Pampers. In 1983, they launched Depends and aggressively went after the mass market P&G hadn’t managed to attract. The trick: to overcome the stigma that still clung to the condition using TV ads — some depicting older people remaining defiantly active, others relying on the powerful spokesperson the company found in actress June Allyson. Their gambit proved successful, with Kimberly-Clark commanding nearly half of the adult-incontinence market today. No medical condition is too embarrassing to talk about on the tube in 2016, and Kimberly-Clark's recent campaigns have capitalized on this new frankness. The Depend line has also grown to include sleeker, more fashion-friendly incontinence underwear, now modeled by younger (and presumably continent) actors and athletes to show how undetectable they are. There's never been a better time to be a style-conscious senior with a decreasingly cooperative bladder. For baby boomers, the expansion of the incontinence industry serves as a fitting bookend to their generational saga. They were the first kids to be regularly swathed in disposables, after all, and the ever-upward march of commercial diaper technology has taken place almost entirely in their lifetimes. Montage directors may choose to focus on civil rights and Vietnam and Buffalo Springfield, but the story of the U.S. baby boom is just as much one of stinky plastic diapers. — Cecil Adams Send questions to Cecil via cecil@straightdope.com.

Jared Leto poses topless in a bathtub for the new Gucci Guilty campaign. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments The actor-and-musician smoulders in the scent’s new advertisements, sitting in the water with model Julia Hafstrom, while fashion star Vera Van Erp sits below them. In the film, shot by photographer Glen Luchford, Jared and the women are featured in a series of sexy flashbacks of a wild night. “I am friends with Alessandro (Michele, creative director),” Jared told WWD. “This was like shooting a little film with friends.” The short film was set in Venice, which Jared describes as a “magical place”, adding: “It’s a city that really shouldn’t exist, a city on water. So the place in and of itself is a bit of a dream. (The filming) felt like it belonged in Venice. It stoked our imagination, and it was a really fun and creative project.” Jared’s role sees him take over from Captain America actor Chris Evans, who previously featured in a raunchy campaign opposite Evan Rachel Wood. Luis Miguel Gonzalez Sebastiani, global director of Gucci Beauty at Procter & Gamble, Gucci’s fragrance licensee, looks back at those ads with fondness, as they helped to propel the scent into the spotlight after its original launch in 2010. “It was very impactful advertising,” he recalled. “We were bringing a concept which was extremely relevant for the audience at the time - for the younger audience - which was a bit of sex on display, trying to break some of the taboos of society at the time.” With Gucci Guilty targeting a Millennial audience, the new campaign has been given the Instagram hashtag #GuiltyNotGuilty. Jared also took over the brand’s Snapchat last December (15) after his role was announced and he praises the social platform as a “unique” way to inform people around the world. The campaign will launch worldwide in September (16), while teasers will air on TV at the end of this month (Aug16). © Cover Media Online Editors Your Comments COMMENT RULES: Comments that are judged to be defamatory, abusive or in bad taste are not acceptable and contributors who consistently fall below certain criteria will be permanently blacklisted.

Mushroom interior Gary Yokoyama,The Hamilton Spectator Hugh Clark and Caroline Williamson in their Mushroom House. Outside John Rennison,The Hamilton Spectator 7 Rolph St. in Dundas next play/pause pre Hamilton Spectator By Jeff Mahoney SEE MOREarticles from this author People call it the Mushroom House, though Caroline Williamson thinks it looks more like a spaceship, and she should know. She lives here. It came with the husband. That would be Hugh Clark, whom she married in 2007 (the romance began at a bridge tournament). He bought the beautifully unusual, stem-mounted, cantilevered 12-sided structure in Dundas in 1989, from the Lennard family, of Lennard underwear and hosiery fame. Architect Harry Lennard designed the house for his parents Burt and Gladys in 1971, when he was working with the late Trevor Garwood Jones, and the place has been talked about and gawked at ever since. "We get knocks on the door," says Caroline. Curious passersby. Until nearby Parkside Secondary closed, in 2014, high school kids would pop by, say things like "cool house," adds Hugh. When he was a boy growing up in the Great Depression on York and Queen, there were other knocks on the door from strangers. "People looking for food; mom always fed them," says Hugh. "I guess we called them tramps. I'd keep them company on the back stoop. That house is long gone." Hugh remembers those times, and the strike of 1946. "I've never seen a strike like that." It was so charged. He was only 14 but the times excited in him a goosebump sense that Hamilton history was being fundamentally reshaped, a sense perhaps more forcibly felt by Hugh than by most, Hamilton history being so woven into the fabric of who he is. Long before, in 1874, Hugh's great-grandfather Adam Clark, who'd immigrated to Canada from Scotland, formed Adam Clark Plumbing and Heating on James South. "We have some of the old records," says Hugh, smiling. "The plumbers' rate was 20 cents an hour, 21 cents if it was Adam himself as he was president." That company, under successive generations of Clarks, evolved into a vital civic force, branching out from plumbing-heating to fire protection, construction and, in a pioneering way, air conditioning. Its clients accounted for much of the physical and social infrastructure of Hamilton: Stelco, hospitals, churches, schools, McMaster, hotels, The Spectator, Westinghouse, Bell, Otis, Skyway Bridge, Procter and Gamble. The company, by the time Hugh became president, was as woven into the fabric of Hamilton as the city was into the fabric of the Clarks. There's another history, though, swirling around in the corners and gills of the "Mushroom House." Before she was one year old, Caroline moved to Cuba (father worked for a sugar company in Havana), where she grew into womanhood. "She talks about Cuba sometimes in terms of paradise," says Hugh. "That's a little extreme," frowns Caroline, who went to Wellesley, returned to Cuba, then had to leave again with the revolution. "We got kicked out. But it was my home. It was a great place to live." The weather, the people, the geography and culture. "It was painful to lose friends," she says. The door closed on that part of her life. Caroline doesn't like to re-open it but even across the distance of those years and in this other-world of her life now, there's a powerful pull she can't disguise. She says something in Spanish. I've no idea what, but it sounds beautiful. I think it's the name of the sugar company. Hugh's story has wrenching twists, too. After 99 years the family company was sold to an American company. Difficulties occurred, and Hugh was asked back, as CEO. Ultimately, the employees bought the company with Hugh and brother Alan at the helm. "Those were my favourite years," Hugh says, of the years when the company was employee owned. By this time they were into mining projects, sometimes in places like Ghana and Kyrgyzstan. Ultimately Adam Clark Co. got bought by Aecon, and now, says Hugh, they're doing projects 10 times the size of those undertaken during his time. The legacy survives in the Clark Family Foundation Fund, founded by Hugh and brother Alan. It's part of Hamilton Community Foundation and supports many great causes. Hugh and Caroline have both been very energetic volunteers — YMCA, McMaster (Hugh's a graduate) and many other organizations. They love their mushroom house, with the wood-clad ceilings, clerestory windows, circular staircase, large central skylight and all rooms radiating from the kitchen, which is in the middle of everything. They love all the history in it — and all its future. The high school's gone, but there are 14 grandchildren, two great-grandchildren. They can't get enough of the "Mushroom House." jmahoney@thespec.com 905-526-3306 Jeff Mahoney is a columnist with the Hamilton Spectator.

LAHORE: The quality of public health services has seen a downturn over the last few decades in the country, whereas the rising population is increasing the pressure on state institutions. World Health Organisation (WHO) has recommended allocating six percent of GDP to curtail the country’s deteriorating health conditions. However, WHO claims that the total expenditure on health is 2.4 percent of GDP in Pakistan, of which private expenditure constitutes 83.6 percent. Pakistan has a mixed health system - it focuses on curative than preventive strategies. Most of the health system financing is directed towards communicable disease such as various vertical programmes running in the country. Given the current level of government expenditure on health and awareness programmes, an improvement in this sector seems unlikely. Healthcare challenges in the country are attributed to the lack of access to basic health care services, poverty, health infrastructure and personnel in addition to illiteracy, low status of women, inadequate water supplies and sanitation. Moreover, poor governance, mismanagement, inefficiencies, and lack of information are often used synonymously in a health systems context. In urban areas, access to healthcare clinics and facilities is not a problem, though the general state and quality of public services is very poor. On the other hand, in rural areas, hospitals and basic health care units are situated far from habilitations. Unfortunately, the government does not have the required infrastructure and facilities to provide the complete healthcare solutions, especially to the underprivileged. According to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Pakistan, only 52 percent of child deliveries take place in presence of a skilled birth attendant in country. Pakistan represents an unacceptably high maternal mortality setting and needs an immediate attention for substantial and sustained reduction in the risk of dying during pregnancy. However, almost half of the children do not receive a full course of vaccinations, with large variations in coverage across provinces, characterised by geographical and wealth inequities. Although, Human Immunodeficiency Virus prevalence is low in country, the outbreak is concentrated in key populations such as people who inject drugs (27.2 per cent) and transgender sex workers (5.2 per cent). And these issues are just the tip of the iceberg. The need of the hour is to prepare a fully-fledged drive and/or campaign, to create awareness among the masses regarding the hardships and impediments coming their way. Private institutes can work in partnership with the government bodies at every level from the local to provincial and federal, alongside NGOs, CSOs. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) practices is still lacking among companies in Pakistan. CSR can be understood as “The continuing commitment by businesses to behave ethically and contribute to economic development while improving the quality of life of the workforce and their families (by providing health insurance) as well as of the local community and society at large.” There is a dire need for an aggressive intervention by private institutes to strengthen the network of health services via awareness among the illiterate, who constitute the majority of population. The private sector along with NGOs could play a crucial role in spreading awareness among schools, colleges and universities. An example in this regard was set six years ago, when a private multinational Procter and Gamble Pakistan and an NGO ‘Save the Children’ came together to build 100 sanitation facilities in 100 days in major three cities including Lahore, Karachi and Quetta. They targeted 40,000 school-age children in their health and hygiene awareness campaign. Such measures could help reduce the burden of communicable disease to a large extent. Private sector players need to come out of ‘their comfort zones’ to take healthcare programmes to the unreachable through effective public-private partnerships (PPP). A new cadre of community health workers needs to be created to act as a bridge between the community and health units through the Social Action Programmes. These workers can help disseminate awareness among the masses. Community participation should be encouraged in all the aspects and at all levels so as to provide quality care according to community interests and to make all the programmes successful. One major strategy by private companies could be the involvement of media in creating mass awareness among people about the health related issues and reforms, by targeting community curiosity and participation. Moreover, private companies can design their advertising/marketing campaigns in a manner to highlight these gruesome issues.

Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper summed it all up in a Twitter hashtag on Wednesday night: #priorities City Council's are out-of-whack, and that was really exposed this week. Let's recap: All heroin hell broke loose Tuesday night when Cincinnati police responded to 21 overdose calls in a matter of hours. On Wednesday afternoon, City Council sat in a hastily called special meeting to address whispers that City Manager Harry Black's job could be in jeopardy. Politics Extra has another hashtag for this: #poppycock (to borrow a favorite word of Councilman Charlie Winburn) Winburn and Councilman Wendell Young called the special meeting – despite no emails, no testimonies, no nothing to support a reason to hold a public session and address rumors. It was nothing more than political retaliation against Mayor John Cranley, who last month did an end-around Black by negotiating raises with public-employee unions. Young badly wants City Councilwoman Yvette Simpson to unseat Cranley in next year's mayoral race. Winburn, who faces being term-limited off Council, hasn't ruled out challenging Cranley in the mayor's race. Cranley should be held accountable for that sneaky negotiating tactic, which many believe was a political maneuver to win favor with unions ahead of next year's election. Winburn and Young could exact payback on the campaign trail or by introducing legislation to offer an alternative to Cranley's wage-hike proposal. (The city and unions ended up reaching a contract agreement Thursday night.) But Wednesday was the wrong day and the wrong way. In fairness, Young and Winburn called the meeting early Tuesday before the overdose news was widespread. But the drug issues dominated the news cycle Wednesday morning, and there was plenty of time to cancel the afternoon special meeting. Vice Mayor David Mann questioned the need for the meeting, which sucked up 1 hour and 15 minutes. Councilman Christopher Smitherman called it "political gamesmanship" and a "waste of time." Council members Amy Murray and Chris Seelbach were out of town. But all others were required to sit through the bicker-filled meeting when they could have been on the streets supporting cops or meeting with drug-treatment professionals to hear their concerns or hunkered down in their offices working on legislation to try to fight the heroin scourge. There was no mention of the heroin problem during the special meeting – not even a thank you to first responders for saving lives. Heck, even a top law enforcement officer in Columbus weighed in on Twitter praising Cincinnati police for their efforts this week. (To their credit, Mann and Councilman P.G. Sittenfeld teamed up on Thursday to ask the state to help with the overdose crisis, which got worse throughout the week. Sittenfeld's efforts to address the issue began before the special meeting.) After The Enquirer tweeted City Hall reporter Sharon Coolidge's story recapping the meeting late Wednesday, Pepper responded on Twitter by saying: "While dozens of overdoses occur across city ... #productive" Pepper, a former City Councilman, declined comment to Politics Extra. He didn't need to say anything else. The overdoses should be enough of a wake-up call for City Council to get its priorities straight. If it doesn't, maybe Council should go back to two-year terms. Running every two years provides a reality check and keeps everyone from getting sucked too far into the vacuum of City Hall. Business, politics and transportation Don't be surprised if the Cincinnati USA Regional Chamber starts placing a high priority on trying to improve the region's public transportation system. The Chamber's top leaders care about it, and they recognize our bus system is woeful at connecting people to jobs. They also recognize the important role public transportation plays in attracting car-ditching Millennials, who look for jobs in places where there's a viable bus and rail system. How is this political, you ask? The Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority is exploring asking Hamilton County voters next year to approve a sales-tax hike to improve bus service. Chamber CEO Jill Meyer, one of few business leaders to publicly support the streetcar, replaced Cranley as the city's representative on the Hamilton County Transportation Improvement District board this week. In February, Meyer lured Brendon Cull away from Kroger to be the Chamber's new senior vice president. He is a Cranley-appointed member of the SORTA board. Cranley has quietly pushed for the Metro bus system to be improved. This issue is tailor-made for the Chamber. It would lend credibility to the effort of fixing public transportation, and the Chamber has the ability to get Procter & Gamble, Kroger, Macy's and other top companies on board. Viable transit is a key factor in fighting poverty, and it also could help Cincinnati companies beat out other Midwestern cities for talented workers. Social media squabble After Politics Extra pointed out a month ago that Seelbach had turned into Mr. Nice Guy on social media, a few loyal readers emailed to say they were skeptical about how long the City Councilman's newfound Facebook and Twitter persona would last. The answer: Four months. In news stories on Tuesday, Cranley spokeswoman Holly Stutz Smith called on Seelbach and Young to apologize for calling Black a liar earlier this summer. Seelbach fired back on Twitter that night, posting a quote from First Lady Michelle Obama: "When they go low, we go high." Smith responded: "Calling someone a liar is going low, saying your (sic) sorry is going high." Seelbach got the last word: "Check time your boss threatened African American Civil Rights Icon Marian Spencer #LowAsYouCanGo" Cranley and Spencer butted heads over the mayor's proposed city parks tax last year. But Cranley helped in the effort to rename part of Walnut Street after the city's first African-American councilwoman, and the mayor drove Spencer to the dedication ceremony of "Marian Spencer Way" in April.

Americans between 18 to 24 are largely snubbing the old-fashioned bar of soap, leading to sales declines for the likes of Ivory’s iconic 125-year old bar and its bar soap rivals, according to new data from consumer research firm Mintel. Consumers who still buy bar soap, it turns out, have something in common: they tend to be over 60 years old and are men. It’s not as if Americans are less clean. Sales of soap, bath and shower products are on the rise, with overall market growth of 2.7 percent last year, Mintel found. Sales of bar soaps, though, slipped 2.2 percent from 2014 to 2015 as younger consumers and women snubbed the traditional bar in favor of liquid soap. So what’s driving the generational shift? Millennials believe bar soaps are covered in germs after they are used. Some older Americans might scoff at that belief, and there’s some research to back them up. A 1988 study found that people who washed with bar soaps contaminated with bacteria didn’t have a detectable level of of the bacteria on their hands. There are a few issues with that study, however. For one, it was backed by Dial soap, and secondly, it was published before the spread of newer pathogens like antibiotic-resistant MRSA emerged, which raises the stakes for having clean hands. (Some millennials might point out it was published before they were born.) On the hand, some health authorities are now recommending a switch to liquid soap, with Minnesota’s Department of Health​ noting that germs can grow on bar soap and spread infections.  About 60 percent of Americans over the age of 65 believe it’s fine to wash their faces with a bar of soap, compared with only 33 percent of people between 25 to 34 years old. Liquid soap has something else going for it: a convenience factor that allows packaged goods companies to sell new products at a higher price point. Companies ranging from Procter & Gamble to Unilever are constantly tweaking their products to develop new products to appeal to young consumers. It may be no surprise that liquid soaps and in-shower moisturizers have a much higher price tag than the traditional bar of soap. “In order to turn sluggish sales around, new bar soap product launches could incorporate a wider variety of claims, especially for more luxury and premium bar soap offerings,” said Margie Nanninga, beauty analyst at Mintel, in a statement.  © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc..

Like other big companies before it, including Wal-Mart and Google, Apple recently received a federal designation for its energy subsidiary that allows it to become a wholesale seller of electricity from coast to coast. In effect, Apple is creating its own green utility company, although the main customer is itself. The motives may be economic as much as they are environmental. As a wholesaler, Apple could reduce the cost of its electricity load, which reached 831 million kilowatt-hours in the last fiscal year – enough to power about 76,000 homes for a year. But like a growing number of corporations, Apple is intent on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production — one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. In one ambitious venture, Apple has contracted with First Solar to begin buying a little less than half of the power later this year from California Flats, a solar energy farm now under construction. Under the terms of the deal, Apple will pay $848 million for the electricity over 25 years and receive the farm’s total output by the end of the agreement. It is one of largest commercial clean energy contracts yet. Lisa Jackson, former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, who is now the Apple executive overseeing environmental policy, social initiatives and worldwide government affairs, said she hoped Apple could serve as a model for the many other big corporate power users that are now embracing clean energy. “This is just another sort of innovative way to get that power onto the grid so we don’t have to take the California grid-mix default, which still includes fossil fuel,” Jackson said. Google, which received its federal energy wholesale designation from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 2010, is a big proponent of the approach Apple is now taking. “Running any kind of business, having predictability in terms of your operating costs can be very important,” said Gary Demasi, director of operations for data centre energy and location strategy at Google, which has been a leading investor in and user of clean energy. “Renewable energy, from a cost perspective, is now competitive with other forms of energy, much more so than it was a few years ago.” In the United States, the generating capacity of corporate clean energy projects has more than doubled each year since 2013, according to the Business Renewables Centre at the Rocky Mountain Institute, which tracks publicly announced deals. In 2015, 11 companies signed up for 3.23 gigawatts’ worth of projects, roughly the equivalent of five coal plants and up from 1.18 gigawatts the year before. Executives face greater pressure from shareholders and customers to show that they are doing their part to fight climate change. At the same time, corporate energy use has exploded, driven in many cases by the ravenous demands of the data cloud. “We are all becoming very large energy players, and this is a shift,” said Brian Janous, director of energy strategy at Microsoft. “Energy is not something that Microsoft or Amazon or Google really ever had to think much about prior to the advent of the cloud.” Helping drive that shift are environmental groups like the World Resources Institute. In May, it helped create the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance, a coalition of nonprofits that has more than 60 corporations in its network, including McDonald’s and General Motors, as well as Google and Wal-Mart. Although the companies say these arrangements mean they are running their businesses on renewable energy, in reality the clean power often does not flow directly to their facilities. They typically buy the renewable energy in amounts to match what they draw from the grid — a system of swaps that Jackson of Apple likened to using an ATM. “The dollar you deposit in the bank might not be the exact same bill that you get out,” she said. Robert Shapiro, a partner at the law firm Chadbourne & Parke who focuses on project finance and energy, describes it as meaningful symbolism. “They’re actually getting power from their local utility, which may be coal,” Shapiro said. “But they’re deemed to have put into the world carbon-neutral energy, which they are deemed to have used for their load.” To keep track of clean energy credits, power generators work with registries to issue numbered certificates. “The power flows into the grid. The electrons go where they go,” Tawney said. “But because there’s a renewable-energy certificate, no one else can claim the same zero-carbon benefit.” Such complexities are necessary, executives and clean energy advocates say, because it is not often feasible to install enough renewable-power generators at corporate sites to meet companies’ full energy needs. Energy buyers’ alliance Wal-Mart, despite having installed solar panels, wind turbines and fuel cells at stores and distribution centres, can nonetheless meet only about a third of those operations’ energy needs. So it also buys renewable energy from generators and utilities, said David Ozment, director of energy at Wal-Mart stores. Procter & Gamble, another member of the energy buyers’ alliance, has arranged to purchase all of the steam from a biomass generator under construction at a plant in Georgia where it makes Charmin toilet paper and Bounty paper towels, said Jack McAneny, the company’s director of sustainability. But that was possible, he said, only because of the plant’s location near a source of waste wood and pulp for fuel and the cooperation of P&G’s partners. Among those partners are the local utility, Georgia Power, which will buy the electricity from the generator for its customers from Constellation, the company that developed and will own and operate the generator. At Apple, where the purchase or production of renewable energy has more than tripled since 2012, the company would prefer to not have to go to great lengths to ensure a clean energy supply, Jackson said. But the public energy grid is simply still too dependent on carbon-based fuels to make that possible. “If we had our preference, we’d just be able to say, ‘We want 100% green power everywhere we use power,’” Jackson said. “The best would be if we could run every one of our stores, every one of our data centres, office complex, building we have, on 100% renewable – and if we didn’t have to spend a whole bunch of our time and energy figuring out how to get that done.” Go to Top Tweet Videos New Rs. 2,000 notes recovered from gunned...

Thailand Press Release News search General Business Entertainment IT Stcoks Lifestyle Telecom Energy Properties Automotive Heathcare Events ฝากข่าวประชาสัมพันธ์ Fernando Fischmann wins Stevie Award, considered the Oscar for Business General Press Releases Thursday August 25, 2016 13:52 Bangkok--25 Aug--Total Quality PR The scientist and entrepreneur was awarded with The Stevie® Award in its two categories: Innovator of the Year, for his sustainable vision for water usage, and for Innovation of the Year, for his water desalination technology that uses no energy The Award has previously been given to Steve Jobs from Apple, Jeff Bezos from Amazon, Coca-Cola's Kent Muhtar and Alan Mulally from the Ford Motor Company. The award ceremony will take place in October at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, Rome. On the occasion, Fischmann will receive the awards that the New York Post described as the "Oscars for business", a name well-known globally, and that singles out "good business leaders" around the world. The "Innovation of the Year" award was given to Fischmann for his water desalination technology that uses no energy, and that aims to solve some of humanity's greatest problems, like energy and water scarcity. Considered to be one of the world's most coveted awards, and described by the New York Post as the "Oscars of the business world", Fernando Fischmann, founder and President of Crystal Lagoons, won the Innovator of the Year award of the International Business Awards. Furthermore, the water desalination technology that uses no energy, developed by Crystal Lagoons, won the Innovation of the Year award, and, as a result Fischmann will receive both Stevie® Award trophies this October. The same prize has been awarded in recent years to the most important and recognized CEOs of the world like Steve Jobs from Apple, Jeff Bezos from Amazon, Kent Muhtar from Coca-Cola, Alan Mulally from the Ford Motor Company and other outstanding companies like IBM, Disney, AT&T and Coca-Cola. This year's version received over 3,800 nominations from 60 countries, and Fischmann was chosen as the person or company to have contributed most to innovation, with the company Cisco Systems taking second place. He also won the award for the main technological innovation, for his water desalination technology that uses no energy that seeks to solve some of humanity's greatest problems, such as energy and water scarcity. The jury for the International Business Awards is composed of over 200 opinion leaders, executives and academics from around the world, including representatives from Nike, DHL, HSBC, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, American Express and others. The judges made tremendously positive comments about the scientist, such as "Fernando Fischmann is the embodiment of an innovator! What is even more remarkable is that his innovation has a positive impact on the environment". Another member of the committee praised the innovator, affirming that "Fischmann sees a challenge, sees an opportunity and looks for a solution or creates new technology to accomplish his goal. An innovator!" Additionally, another judge expressed that, "it is a wonderful innovation and initiative to provide solutions to humanity's critical need for survival. A well anticipated innovation and a noble contribution to the wellbeing of the world". The International Business Awards gala ceremony will take place on 21st October in the Rome Cavalieri, Waldorf Astoria Hotel, Rome, Italy. On the occasion, Fischmann will receive two Stevie® Award trophies, golden statues that recognize the winners of these international awards that were created by R.S. Owens, the same manufacturers as Hollywood's Oscars. The track record of the founder of Crystal Lagoons and the success story of this innovation multinational, that in less than 7 years has 15 offices around the world and a packed portfolio that totals 400 projects in different stages of development in 60 countries –that have transformed it into the World's Top Amenity- have meant that the scientist has received more than 20 additional awards. Amongst the awards one can highlight the USA's Best New Business award, Keys to Miami from the Beacon Council, Innovation Award from Florida's Governor, two Guinness World Records, as well as being the only executive to have received awards for Best Entrepreneur, Best Innovator and Best Businessman. Fischmann has developed and patented various technologies that have enabled a change in people's lifestyles around the world, with a portfolio of over 1,000 patents in 160 countries globally. Today, his scientific efforts are focused on the development of a wide variety of industrial applications that enable world problems to be solved, such as energy, water scarcity and environmental degradation.www.crystal-lagoons.comwww.fernandofischmann.com Latest Press Release Seagate and the National Science Museum (NSM) lead young children to the scientific world for the 2nd consecutive years Seagate Technology (Thailand) Limited partners with the National Science Museum (NSM) in launching "The 2nd Year of Science and Technology Education Development Project by NSM and Seagate Thailand".

His name is on the door of one of Madison’s oldest and most successful tech companies. And he made the UW-Madison Alumni Association’s Forward Under 40 list when he was just 25 years old. But the 29-year-old president and CEO of Hardin Design & Development tends to shy away from the spotlight. And when he gets home from work, you won’t catch him near a computer. He lives in a gorgeous house on eight acres in Verona, which he owns free and clear. His garage, which he remodeled all by himself, is filled with luxury vehicles — Porsche, Jaguar, Mercedes. He loves fine dining and wine so much that he hand-built his very own cellar, with room to store more than 800 bottles. He’s addicted to home improvement projects, harvesting timber from his property to build things like an outdoor fire pit with seating for up to 40 friends. Life is good in the Hardin household. “People joke that I’m kind of a recluse,” Hardin says. “I’m not someone who’s going to 10 networking events a week. I’d rather be out working on my land.” Madison’s tech and startup scene has exploded in the last decade, with local innovators and industry groups continually pushing it to become the entrepreneurial epicenter for the entire Midwest. Many of the local success stories have since become household names — Epic Systems and its various spinoffs, EatStreet and the ever-growing stable of local food tech companies, PerBlue, Raven Software and the array of other gaming companies. But while some startup stories have garnered attention and grabbed headlines, other innovators tend to fly more under the radar. Hardin says he’s “not really wired to seek out publicity” — a personality type that makes him unique among CEOs. “Jon is definitely an enigmatic figure in the tech community,” says co-founder Scott Resnick, who serves as the public face of Hardin Design & Development. “I get to go do fun outreach and sell the Hardin brand, and Jon’s back at HQ doing programming — and that’s what he does very well.” Hardin’s close friends like to joke that he’s always one stroke shy of perfection — he scored 35 out of 36 on the ACT; he got one B in college. But he’s earned a reputation for hard work and intellect through his record of solving some of the toughest software engineering problems brought forth by his clients. “Folks may not see that side of Hardin, but he’s the engine that drives the company,” Resnick says. Since the company’s humble beginnings in a dorm room on the second floor of UW-Madison’s Chadbourne Hall, Hardin Design & Development’s business has grown considerably. What started as two college kids trolling Craigslist for freelance web development gigs has evolved to a fully fledged boutique software development firm with offices in Madison, Chicago and Dallas and an extensive list of clients, both domestic and international. These days, Hardin Design & Development has as an average of 30 different projects in the pipeline at any given time. They range considerably in size and scope — the smallest can be knocked out by a single developer in three days, and the largest can take a team of five developers up to four years to build. One such project, which Hardin describes as the “crown jewel” of the company’s portfolio, is called Visual Manager, a commercial real estate management and business intelligence platform that the company developed at the request of a client, Fischer & Company. It’s now being used by FedEx, IBM and a host of other big companies. The technology is a complex marriage of data storage and analytics, which allows users to take information from disparate sources and gain insight on things like competitor locations, market characteristics and demographic trends. The Visual Manager project was a massive undertaking — not to mention a huge get for the small company — but both Hardin and Resnick speak modestly about landing the deal, crediting the intersecting relationships they’ve built over the years and the stellar reputation the firm has established. “At the end of the day, it all goes back to talent,” Resnick says. “And Jon is one of the best developers, if not the best developer, I’ve ever had the pleasure of knowing.” Hardin is hardly the only hard-working entrepreneur to escape notice. The city is filled with people quietly pursuing innovative ideas and shaping Madison’s future. But, like Hardin, they all have a story to tell. × Expand Laura Zastrow Winnie Karanja — The inspirer Winnie Karanja has a vivid memory of what it felt like to be the only girl — and the only African American — in her web design class at McFarland High School. “I remember thinking, ‘This isn’t okay,’” says Karanja, who immigrated to the Madison area from Kenya with her parents and sister in 1999. “There’s such a benefit to having diversity in the tech field.” Women and minorities are notoriously underrepresented in the tech industry, both in Madison and across the nation. Karanja’s desire to shift those demographics and encourage girls and students of color to break into the field led her to create Maydm, an educational nonprofit that teaches kids a range of entry-level tech industry skills. Karanja founded the initiative in November 2015, and in the first teaching sessions held from April through June of this year, she’s reached more than 80 students. Of those, 40% were girls, and 76% were students of color — statistics that are “very unlike the tech field,” Karanja says. She’s still analyzing demographic data for sessions held in July and August. “Technology is made for everybody, but it’s not made by everybody,” Karanja says. Maydm, which is a play off the phrase “made by them,” aims to get students comfortable with the idea that they, too, can code the next big app or build the next iPhone. Karanja is young — she’s under 30, but she declines to reveal her exact age, out of concerns that people in the industry won’t take her seriously. A self-taught coder and a graduate of the London School of Economics and Politics with a bachelor’s in education and a master’s in developmental economics, Karanja says her background gives her a “unique and intersectional worldview” that has helped define Maydm’s platform. As a teacher, she sees technology-focused education as an essential tool to propel girls and students of color into higher-earning jobs. And as a developmental economist, she knows that good jobs are among the most important factors for reducing poverty, hunger and housing insecurity among vulnerable populations.  “The average tech job in Wisconsin [pays] $70,000 per year,” Karanja says. “That’s where we want our students to be.” Maydm targets youth from third to 12th grade, offering single-day and weekend training sessions as well as a flagship, semester-long course that officially launches this fall with the new school year. The program is fee-based, but Maydm partners with sponsor organizations to provide scholarships for low-income students. Students learn technical skills, including programming and working with open-source electronic hardware, as well as soft skills like communication, teamwork, leadership and resume-writing. Students develop a portfolio showcasing the skills they learned from Maydm, which they can use as a reference when looking for a job. Partners from local tech companies, like Bendyworks and Zendesk, serve as mentors, giving students an insider’s look at how the industry works. Surveys given to Maydm participants before and after the course show that the curriculum has a big impact on the way students think about themselves and technology. Karanja believes Maydm will eventually become known as a “top talent pipeline” that connects bright young workers from diverse backgrounds to job opportunities at local tech companies. In the future, she plans to form an alumni network to make sure program graduates remain connected as they begin their professional lives. “If Wisconsin is moving to become a tech hub,” Karanja says, “it should not be an afterthought to bring in girls and students of color.” × Expand Laura Zastrow Fred Willis — The playmaker Former Wisconsin Badgers football player Fred Willis can pinpoint the exact moment he realized that his heart wasn’t in the game. He was in the locker room with his teammates before the 2011 Big 10 conference home opener against Nebraska — a huge game versus a brand-new rival — and the players were swept up in an impassioned pep talk by one of the coaches. “[The coach] was so pumped up, and everybody was so geeked,” Willis recalls. “He looks around and starts yelling, ‘Everybody’s been waiting for a moment like this all their lives, right?’” The players roared their agreement, but the question gave Willis, then a freshman wide receiver, pause. Unlike his teammates, many of whom had been training since elementary school, he hadn’t been waiting his whole life for that moment — in fact, he had only been playing football for a few years when college recruiters started calling. “Literally everybody was like, ‘Hell yes!’” Willis remembers. “And I was there just thinking, ‘Maybe I’m in the wrong place.’” Willis hung up his jersey in August 2012 — a move that cost him a full-ride scholarship to UW-Madison. Struggling to pay for school and unsure what career path to pursue, he eventually dropped out, entering what he calls his “free-fall” phase. He dabbled in graphic design, videography, studied financial planning and eventually decided to teach himself computer programming. Willis, whose decision to quit football stemmed in part from a desire to have more control over his time, saw web development as a good opportunity for him to earn a living while working independently and being his own boss. “I needed something that fit into my schedule, but I didn’t have $19,000 to spend on a three-month [coding program],” says Willis, who then enrolled in a part-time web developer course that was offered online. Within a month, he had mastered the basics of Ruby on Rails, a widely used full-stack language, and built his first website, a simple blog. “It wasn’t hard for me to pick up at all,” says Willis, noting that he’s always been a bit of a natural with computers and technology and that there are a number of other “techies” in his family. “I didn’t learn everything, but I went straight for the core.” In June, Willis, now 23, launched his business, Hacknvest, which combines his specialties: web development and financial investing. He builds software for his “strategic partners” in exchange for a percentage of their business, then he turns around and invests the capital to generate even more income. So far, he’s built relationships with local businesses like the Soap Opera and Dane Buy Local, as well as a number of financial companies and nonprofits. “I don’t really have clients [so much as] I try to build relationships with other business entities,” Willis says. Inspired by Warren Buffett, Willis’ investing skills are also self-taught. And he’s incorporated his tech skills into his strategy, building a “web scraping” program that harvests information on undervalued stocks, which he then considers when diversifying his portfolio. Eventually, his goal is to bring in five figures of business each month. He’s not quite there yet, but he says persistence, networking and continually learning new skills will help him land that “big breadwinner.” Though he’s found success as a programmer and enjoys being an entrepreneur, Willis says it isn’t just the work that he’s passionate about — it’s more about the freedom to make his own schedule and be his own boss that his independent venture allows. “I like the idea of having time and money,” Willis says. “It’s important for me to have a balance of both.” × Expand Laura Zastrow Kelly Ehlers — The socialite As president of a company that specializes in social media, Kelly Ehlers doesn’t exactly intend to fly under the radar. But her highly specialized niche business is rare in the world of marketing and advertising agencies.  “It was a real gamble focusing on social in the beginning,” says Ehlers, recalling the countless times potential clients said they could just have the intern do it. She always responded by asking, “Would you give your intern a microphone and let them be on the 6 o’clock news?” “That’s what it’s like if they’ve got the keys to your social media,” she says. “[Companies] are just now catching on to it.” Ehlers founded her agency, Ideas that Evoke, in 2009, in the midst of the recession and a time of massive upheaval in technology, media and communication. Ehlers was also pregnant with her first child, and her husband had just lost his job. “My husband and I decided to sort of put all our chips on the table,” she says. At that point in the late 2000s, the concept of social media as an e-commerce and communication tool was only just beginning to take shape. Blogging emerged as a platform for brands and influencers, Facebook for businesses became available and widely used, and Twitter was beginning its meteoric rise as a direct marketing and communication device. Technology like Instagram, Snapchat, Periscope and Facebook Live weren’t even in the picture yet.  Especially in those early years, companies didn’t quite understand the nascent technology —  let alone how to harness its potential. But Ehlers, who was working at a traditional advertising agency at the time, took notice that some of the big, international brands were starting to “dip their toes in the water” of social media. She was fascinated — and hooked. “It was kind of opportunistic,” she says. “I thought, ‘Let’s just see where this goes.’” At first, it took a lot of convincing on Ehlers’ part even to get companies to consider adding a line item in their budget for social media. Businesses understood things like print advertising, radio spots and billboards, but social media was an intangible — up until the point that it started proving its worth. “We can target messages exactly to [a demographic] and turn that lead into a sale,” Ehlers says. And when clients see results, “it’s magical to them.” Over the last seven years, Ehlers has transformed her one-woman agency into a bustling company with more than 30 employees. She hired her first employee four years ago, but the majority of the company’s growth happened in the past year and a half. She specializes in the beauty, lifestyle and luxury market, representing a number of international clients, including Elizabeth Arden and Proctor & Gamble. In 2015, Ideas that Evoke was named one of the best entrepreneurial companies in the nation by Entrepreneur magazine. This year, it landed a spot on Inc. Magazine’s list of the 500 fastest-growing private companies in the nation. It grew 1,000% in the last three years. Here in Madison, Ehlers is partnering with Mary Burke to launch a new initiative called “Building Brave,” a nonpolitical organization that launches this fall. The first event is set for September, but Ehlers can’t release many details, other than saying it will encourage people to step out of their comfort zones. “It’s all about lifestyle, wellness and professional development,” Ehlers says. “We’re bringing these things to other women, which is something I’m really passionate about.” × Expand Laura Zastrow Ted Gurman — The guru Ted Gurman isn’t your typical tech entrepreneur. He spends more time on a yoga mat than he does in front of a computer screen. “There’s absolutely nothing technical about anything I’ve ever done in my whole life,” he says with a laugh. But the lack of a technical background didn’t stop him from founding BlueTree Network, a health care information technology consulting firm that specializes in Epic software. Getting into consulting is a common next step for former Epic employees like Gurman, 36, who was a project manager for the health care software giant from 2006 to 2010. But Gurman, who founded BlueTree with fellow Epic graduate Reggie Luedtke, wanted to build something that was different from the traditional consulting firm. Established in 2012, the company has grown to employ nearly 250 people and has offices in Madison, Denver and New York City. About 180 employees work remotely at client sites. “It’s very common in the consulting world for folks to feel like they’re on an island, like they’re part of a company, but only by name,” says Gurman. “Once they’re done onboarding, done with their background check and done getting their insurance in place, they never hear from the company again.” Not so at BlueTree, where employees are affectionately known as “Blue Leaves.” The company’s philosophy is rooted in the idea of wellness, community-building and development — both professional and personal. From the start, Gurman made it his mission to make his holistic approach to health and mindfulness a central pillar of the company — he gave himself the title of “Minister of Happiness.”  “We find that when someone becomes a Blue Leaf, they want to continue working for us,” Gurman says. “It feels like a family.” The company has an advocacy program that matches new hires with mentors who are dedicated to help facilitate their “personal and professional happiness” at BlueTree, and the company’s structure is not hierarchical. Every employee gets a FitBit and is encouraged to participate in company-wide fitness challenges. Standing desks are available to anybody who wants one. There’s a BlueTree “Give Committee,” funded by a donation from the company’s annual budget and made up of volunteers who meet monthly to decide what kind of philanthropy or volunteer work they’d like to pursue. BlueTree holds volunteering events in the Madison community every two months, and it coordinates with the New York and Denver offices as well. And like many startups, BlueTree offers unlimited vacation — and Gurman makes sure people know that it’s acceptable (and expected) that employees take full advantage of the perk. “I think there’s a generational shift where millennials have different expectations for their work environment. There’s no longer this broad perspective that work is supposed to be unpleasant,” he says. “The way I see it, you only live once. Why would you want anything less?” Tags Isthmus Cover Story Technology by Allison Geyer August 25, 2016 12:00 AM RSS Print Wednesday November 23, 2016 Isthmus Picks The Illusionists Nov 23, 2016 7:30 PM Overture Center-Overture Hall Isthmus Picks Kevin Bozeman and Friends Nov 23, 2016 8:00 PM Comedy Club on State Isthmus Picks Latin Music Fest Nov 23, 2016 8:00 PM Majestic Theatre Thursday November 24, 2016 Sorry, no events.

You’d better read the fine print if backing Exxon Mobil Corp. and British American Tobacco Plc isn’t your idea of doing good. QuickTake Sustainable Investing The oil company accused of misleading investors by hiding evidence about climate change and Europe’s biggest cigarette maker are among the holdings of some of the 30 biggest funds that invest following environmental or social governance guidelines, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While some funds are strict about supporting only clean-energy producers, others buy securities from Big Oil to Big Tobacco along with consumer brands such as Unilever and Facebook Inc. The wide range of holdings is the result of each institution deciding on its own what meets the ethical threshold. Loosening that definition has helped ethical investing grow about 80 percent over the past five years to $223 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. “The industry hasn’t done itself many favors in making sure people understand what’s what,” said Charlie Thomas, who manages 950 million euros ($1 billion) under Jupiter’s Ecology funds, which exclude oil and tobacco in favor of companies that have a solution for environmental issues. “The challenge that we have as a sector is to be very clear with the investor so they know what they’re actually buying. Not all ethical funds are the same.” There’s no agreed definition on what an ethical fund should be. That has allowed to mushroom the number of funds saying they support companies guided by standards on environmental and social governance. There are no set criteria for how companies report performance on those metrics, and no regulator like the Securities and Exchange Commission has set out rules.  The looseness of the system is a concern to the Group of 20 nations, which asked a panel led by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney to draw up a proposal for voluntary reporting standards that companies could follow if they chose. That’s likely to offer best practices to companies and accounting firms that draw up sustainability reports and release data through organizations such as the non-profit CDP and Bloomberg. ESG fund strategies range from excluding only companies they score the worst in their industries on specific metrics to including only the best of their class. Some seek to spur change by working as activist shareholders. A few will invest only in companies that benefit the environment. The only way to tell the difference is to look at what the fund is holding. No Simple Label “There’s not a simple label you can slap on it to solve the problem,” said Greg Elders, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in London tracking ESG data. “Clients think it’s a shortcut for seeing how sustainable a fund is.” The Bloomberg survey found the number of environmentally friendly or ESG funds has more than doubled in the past decade to about 730. Of the top 30, at least six hold oil companies. At Impax Asset Management Group, which runs a $568 million Environmental Markets fund, the number of companies that meet its rules has jumped to 1,500 from 250 in 1999, with the pool of firms eligible to be included growing to $4.1 trillion, according to Jon Forster, a portfolio manager at the firm. Investors have benefited from the diversification of green funds. The MSCI KLD 400 Social Index has risen more than 225 percent from the March 2009 low, about as much as the S&P 500 Index. The gauge includes 400 companies, with Microsoft Corp., Procter & Gamble Co. and Verizon Communications Inc. having the biggest weightings. Growth in the sustainable-fund business, regardless of how “green” some of its investments are, is set to continue. A boom in renewable energy investment along with tighter environmental rules and increasing interest from younger people are the main drivers, said Sarbjit Nahal, head of thematic investing at Bank of America Corp. in London. “The word I would stress is ‘mainstream,’” Nahal said. “There’s been a huge change towards taking longer-term issues into account. This is a space that you want to be in.” Here are some of the top 30 ESG funds that hold oil and tobacco: TIAA-CREF Social Choice Equity Fund, with $2.8 billion under management Tracks the U.S. stock market, giving “special consideration to certain social criteria,” according to the firm’s website. Holdings as of June included Occidental Petroleum Corp., Schlumberger Ltd., ConocoPhillips, Marathon Oil Corp. The fund’s approach is to “include companies that are ESG leaders among their industry and sector peers,” said Manica Piputbundit, an associate at TIAA Global Asset Management, which manages $889 billion including more than $18 billion in ESG funds. KLP AksjeGlobal Indeks I, a $3.7 billion fund Invests in stocks listed in developed markets in accordance to KLP’s guidelines for responsible investment. All coal and tobacco companies are excluded. Holdings include Exxon, BP Plc, Monsanto Co. Exxon was excluded from 2004 until 2009, when it was involved in a bribery case. The fund aims to achieve “positive change through active ownership,” said Annie Bersagel, responsible investment adviser at KLP. DNB Global Indeks, a $1.4 billion fund Avoids companies responsible for “grave harm to the environment” and that don’t meet DNB’s “minimum ethical requirements,” according to its website. Holdings include Exxon, Chevron Corp. and mining giant BHP Billiton Ltd. Weapons, tobacco and pornography companies are excluded, as well as those miners and power producers that get 30 percent or more of their income from coal. ACTIAM NV’s $1.3 billion Responsible Index Fund Tracks the MSCI North America Index, investing “exclusively in shares that meet the ESG criteria, as formulated by ACTIAM,” according to its website. Holdings include British American Tobacco and Royal Dutch Shell Plc. Weapon producers are among the companies excluded. “There are a some products or activities that directly lead to exclusion without prior engagement, but otherwise we see exclusion as a last resort,” Maxime Molenaar, an ESG analyst at ACTIAM, said in an e-mail response to questions. “We would first try to achieve improvements in the companies’ behavior.” Pax World Management LLC, which manages ESG funds including the $1.9 billion Pax Balanced Fund The Balanced Fund selects the best assets from a social and environmental perspective relative to their peers, according to Pax Chief Executive Officer Joseph Keefe, who said he doesn’t see the need for more definitive criteria in ESG investing. Holdings include Occidental Petroleum because of its high ESG ranking, based on Pax’s analysis. “There are a variety of strategies within sustainable investing funds because there are a variety of issues that investors care about,” Keefe said. “You want to design diversified portfolios to provide investors with the opportunity to achieve market or above-market return.” Amundi Asset Management’s Atout Euroland $1.4 billion fund. Its goal is to outperform the MSCI Euro Index by investing at least 75 percent of its assets in euro-zone stocks based on socially-responsible and ESG criteria, in addition to financial criteria, according to the fund’s prospectus. Amundi goes by “best-in-class strategies” rather than banning specific industries, and excludes the worst ESG-rated companies in each of them, the firm said in an e-mailed response to questions. Holdings include Shell and Repsol SA. “A policy of investing in the most efficient and least polluting issuers and avoiding the least efficient, for example, encourages companies and sectors to improve working practices and should reward investors through exposure to the best managed businesses,” a media representative for the firm said. “Blanket bans switch off dialogue and reduce incentives for managements to change.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The writer and director of the award-winning and critically acclaimed documentary Versailles ’73: American Runway Revolution, has produced a new nonfictional motion picture. Titled Olympic Pride, American Prejudice, it sheds light on the experiences of 18 African American Olympians who defied Jim Crow and Adolf Hitler to win hearts and medals at the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin. An advertising executive, a Film Independent Documentary Lab Fellow and member of the Film Fatales network, Draper shares, “I’ve spent my career in advertising and marketing, working on blue chip brands, creating their communication strategy and building campaigns in television, radio, digitally and social media. All of that is storytelling. That storytelling about products and storytelling about brands. I saw this story about this amazing fashion show in 1973 and it had Black models. I thought that’s the story I want to tell. I want to tell a story about who I am, what I believe in and what I think people should know about what we as African Americans has contributed to the world. I am still a marketing person. I am still an advertising person. But I am a filmmaker and I actually get to use those marketing and advertising skills to promote films that I direct, that I write for my production company. All those skills are necessary these days to be an independent filmmaker.” Prev|NextFullscreen 15 Jun 1936 --- Original caption: 6/15/1936-New York, New York- These are the Olympic athletes who will do their stint for Uncle Sam in the big games in Berlin.

They represented a country that considered them second-class citizens and competed in a country that rolled out the red carpet in spite of an undercurrent of Aryan superiority and anti-Semitism. They were world heroes yet returned home to a short-lived glory. This story is complicated. This story is triumphant but unheralded. This story is a vital part of history and is as relevant today as it was almost 80 years ago. Since the 1936 Olympics was a well-documented event, this film will utilize the wealth of newsreel material, newspaper articles, photographs, personal interviews and never-before-seen footage as well as resources from the personal archival collections of Olympians and organizations in both the U.S. and Germany. The film is produced by Coffee Bluff Pictures (www.coffeebluffpictures.com), Draper’s Atlanta-based independent film venture created to develop, produce and distribute compelling stories that shed light on the life and stories of the underrepresented. “What’s beautiful about being a former marketer is that I am able to create wonderful partnerships. We have a great partnership with Comcast. And we have a great partnership with Procter & Gamble. Comcast has afforded everyone with their service to watch this film,” she avers. Narrated by Blair Underwood with executive producers Dr. Amy Tiemann, Michael A. Draper and Underwood,Olympic Pride, American Prejudice is now available on Streampix until September 4, 2016. Xfinity customers can find the documentary on Streampix by visiting the On Demand section or an Xfinity voice remote, simply say: “Black Film & TV” and find “Olympic Pride American Prejudice” in the featured “Olympics Celebration” collection.

Till now, it was focusing on price hikes and high margins to drive growth. Among the new steps, the company is altering the compensation structure of its frontline sales team. Sales people at the Swiss food giant's India arm will now be rewarded on their ability to drive volume growth — with an aim to take it to double digits — and gain market share for the company vis-a-vis simply driving sales on higher prices, which was the norm earlier. "Nestle's volumes here have consistently been under pressure with growth dipping in each of the company's four segments. The company has seen almost zero volume growth in the last four years," said Abneesh Roy, senior VP at Edelweiss Securities. "Spurts in these segments were largely driven by pricing." On closer look, volume growth in each of Nestle's four categories — milk products & nutrition, beverages, prepared dishes & cooking aids, and chocolate & confectionary, showed negative volume growth in 2015, with growth of prepared dishes & cooking aids being the worst hit (-60%) due to Maggi instant noodles being taken off shelves. Maggi accounted for around a third of Nestle India's revenues before the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) banned it in June last year for alleged food safety issues. After its relaunch in November, Maggi has grabbed 57% of the Rs 2,000-crore domestic instant noodles market, said the company. Before the ban, it commanded 80% market share."I think the intent for frontline sales structure is undergoing a change — there is a lot of focus on getting volume growth....on getting new products that we have put in the market on the shelf, on the performance of new products," Suresh Narayanan, chairman and MD, Nestle India told analysts. "For people in the organised trade, we are doing an incentive platform in terms of activation and merchandising." Arvind Singhal, founder of Technopak, said, "Chasing volume growth is the right strategy for Nestle. By simply increasing prices, they face the danger of becoming a premium player, while challengers such as Patanjali are launching lower-priced products to gain market share. Both HUL and P&G tried to play the value growth strategy but failed." To chase double-digit volume growth, the Nestle management has made the company more agile, enhanced inventory management and hastened product launches. It has launched 25 products across several categories in the past eight weeks with many more in the pipeline. It has also beefed up distribution by following a split distribution route (two salespersons will service a retailer).
