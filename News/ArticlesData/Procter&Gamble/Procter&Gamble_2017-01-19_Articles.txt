Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Jan 20, 2017 at 5:18PM Image source: Getty Images. Stocks rose on Friday as both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) indexes finished higher by more than 0.25%. Today's stock market Index Percentage Change Point Change Dow 0.48% 94.85 S&P 500 0.34% 7.62 Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Financial stocks remained popular on a day that saw a new administration take over the executive branch, and that kept the Financial Sector Select SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLF) among the most heavily traded exchange-traded funds. Meanwhile, gold price volatility swung in the positive direction for owners of the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF (NYSEMKT:NUGT), which gained 3% on the day. As for individual stocks, Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) stood out with big moves higher. Procter & Gamble keeps its momentum going Procter & Gamble shares gained 3% following the release of surprisingly strong quarterly earnings results. For the second straight quarter, the consumer goods giant enjoyed healthy volume-driven revenue growth as organic sales rose by 2%. That result was a slowdown from the prior quarter's 3% boost, and it wasn't quite enough to end P&G's overall market share slide. However, it was still a solid performance given intense competition and an overall flat industry. "We delivered good results in the second quarter in a difficult operating environment," CEO David Taylor said in a press release. Image source: P&G. Cost cuts pushed profitability higher despite increased investments in marketing and product innovation. P&G's gross margin rose by more than a percentage point, in fact, and its operating profit margin jumped by 2.3 percentage points. The company's earnings surged higher due to a one-time benefit from its Coty beauty product sales. Stripping that out still left core profit up by 9%. That success puts P&G on track to achieve its long-run target of at least 5% annual earnings growth in 2017 after posting a 2% decline in each of the last two fiscal years. Yet the best news for investors is that the company sees reason for optimism on the top line. P&G raised its full-year organic sales outlook to 2.5% from 2%. Skyworks beats expectations Skyworks solutions shares rallied 13% higher after the company beat its sales guidance and issued an aggressive outlook for the current quarter. Revenue declined for the third straight quarter, but its $914 million sales figure was ahead of management's forecast. The same trend held for earnings, with the semiconductor specialist producing $1.61 per share of profit compared to the $1.58 per share executives had targeted. "Skyworks delivered exceptional financial results...fueled by global demand for ubiquitous mobile connectivity and the Internet of Things," CEO Liam Griffin said in a press release. "We are enabling the next phase of the wireless revolution," he continued, "powering new and previously unimagined applications." The fiscal second quarter is usually a slow period for the industry following the surge in consumer product sales in the first quarter. However, Skyworks thinks that its broader product pipeline will allow it to buck that trend and show solid growth for the first time in a year. The company predicts an 8% sales boost for the current quarter to $840 million as earnings rise to $1.40 per share. Consensus estimates were much less optimistic, modeling $818 million of sales and $1.24 per share of revenue. As a result, investors are raising their expectations, and lifting Skyworks' stock price in the process. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos has no position in any stocks mentioned.

For the second fiscal quarter of 2017, Procter & Gamble Co reported earnings per share of $2.88. This is an increase over its earnings per share of $1.12 from the same time in 2016. It also came in above Wall Street’s earnings per share estimate of $1.06 for the quarter. Procter & Gamble Co notes that the increase in its earnings per share for the fiscal second quarter of 2017 was helped by the divestiture of its Beauty Brands segment. This resulted in a $1.95 per share gain for earnings per share in the quarter. Revenue reported by Procter & Gamble Co for the fiscal second quarter of 2017 was $16.87 billion. The consumer goods company reported revenue of $16.92 billion during the same period from the year prior. Analysts were expecting PG to report revenue of $16.77 billion for its fiscal second quarter of 2017. For the full year of fiscal 2017, Procter & Gamble Co is expecting earnings per share to see mid-single digit growth when compared to fiscal 2016. It is also increasing its guidance for organic sales growth from 2% to between 2% to 3%. Procter & Gamble Co also says that it expects headwinds from foreign exchange and brand divestitures. It claims this will reduce sales growth by 2% to 3% for the year. PG expects this to cause all-in sales for fiscal 2017 to be in line with those from fiscal 2016. “Stronger top-line performance in the first half of the fiscal year is enabling us to increase our organic sales growth outlook for the full year – another step towards the levels of balanced top-line, bottom-line, and cash flow growth that will consistently put P&G shareholder value creation among the best in our industry,” David Taylor, Chairman, President and CEO of Procter & Gamble Co, said in a statement. PG stock was up 2% as of Friday afternoon.

The maker of long list of products including Tide detergent and Gilette shaving products, said the strong results were due in part to cost-cutting initiatives that helped offset the drag from a strong dollar and a cut-throat pricing pressure from competitors. The company has struggled in recent years to grow sales against these headwinds. P&G's strongest division was health, a business that has been boosted by premium products, such as the Oral-B electric toothbrushes, as well as other dental products ©SCOTT OLSON (Getty/Getty Images/AFP/File) P&G's strongest division was health, a business that has been boosted by premium products, such as the Oral-B electric toothbrushes, as well as other dental products. Sales for health were up five percent, and the gain was seven percent when foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures were excluded. "We delivered good results in the second quarter in a difficult operating environment," chief executive David Taylor said. Net earnings for the fiscal second quarter were $7.9 billion, up from $3.3 billion in the same period of the prior fiscal year, due to a large one-time gain from the sale of its beauty products to Coty. Revenues were flat at $16.9 billion. P&G boosted its forecasts for 2017 organic sales growth to two to three percent, up from the prior two percent estimate. Organic sales rose in all five of P&G's businesses. The company cited higher commodity costs and further political and economic volatility as potential risks. Shares of P&G jumped 3.6 percent $87.77 in mid-morning trading. Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Think again. PG stock has been changing while no one was paying attention.

Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified) OK. That’s a bit of an exaggeration … but only just a bit. P&G has spent the last few years making major changes to its business. A huge cost-cutting program has reduced manufacturing headcount by almost a quarter. P&G divested its Duracell brand to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) and shipped its beauty brands to Coty Inc (NYSE:COTY) in a deal that closed in October. It has shut down underperforming brands and realigned its business into 10 key categories. So far, it hasn’t done much for PG stock. To be sure, Procter & Gamble stock hasn’t been a bad investment, particularly considering that PG’s dividend yield has hovered around 3% for the past decade. But it has underperformed not only the S&P 500 but peers like Unilever plc (ADR) (NYSE:UL) and Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). Indeed, PG stock’s current price of $84.93 is still below late 2014 levels. Still, Procter & Gamble is pricing in a reasonable amount of growth; PG shares trade at 22 times consensus earnings estimates. That’s a multiple similar to what P&G received a decade ago, when its organic revenue growth was in the mid-single-digits, and the company posted consistent earnings increases. Clearly, the market is expecting the recent efforts to allow the company to get at least closer to that type of growth. That makes Q2 results rather important for Procter & Gamble and PG stock holders. What to Watch For in P&G’s Q2 Earnings Report Procter & Gamble posted a pretty solid Q1, beating Street estimates and reporting 3% organic sales growth — all of which came from volume, not pricing. But that quarter benefited from an easy comparison, as organic sales had declined in the year-prior quarter. P&G’s second-quarter results will be compared to more normalized results; and indeed, analysts are only expecting a 2% increase in EPS year-over-year. There are two ways to look at the potential market reaction to the quarter. On the one hand, expectations aren’t particularly high as far as PG earnings go — at least on Wall Street, anyway. Estimated EPS growth doesn’t imply any real improvement in the business; PG has retired a sizable number of shares over the past 12 months, both through the Duracell and Coty deals and through its own repurchase plan. Excluding those divested businesses (and other minor changes), it appears analysts are expecting basically flat net income growth and a likely 1%-2% increase in revenue. That seems a reasonably low bar to clear. The flip side is that it also means any type of miss relative to expectations could send PG stock tumbling. Again, this is the first “clean” quarterly report from P&G in some time. The major cost-cutting is being lapped. The Coty deal is done, and product reporting is realigned. The strength in the U.S. dollar (a major problem for P&G the last few years) should be relatively stable year-over-year. P&G now needs to show that the efforts of the last five years — through which investors have waited patiently, in my opinion — are bearing some sort of fruit. If they don’t, I do not believe the market will react kindly.

P&G Announces Second Quarter Earnings Net Sales Unchanged; Organic Sales +2%; Diluted Net EPS $2.88, +157%; Core EPS $1.08, +4% Increases Organic Sales Growth Guidance for Fiscal Year January 20, 2017 07:00 AM Eastern Standard Time CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) reported second quarter fiscal year 2017 net sales of $16.9 billion, unchanged versus the prior year. Organic sales increased two percent. Organic sales and organic volume increased in all five business segments. Diluted net earnings per share were $2.88, an increase of 157% versus the prior year, including a gain of $1.95 per share from the Beauty Brands divestiture to Coty. Core earnings per share were $1.08, an increase of four percent versus the prior year. Currency-neutral core EPS increased nine percent versus the prior year. Operating cash flow was $3.0 billion for the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 82%. The Company returned $1.8 billion of cash to shareholders as dividends, repurchased $1.5 billion of common stock and exchanged shares with a value of $9.4 billion in the Beauty Brands transaction. “We delivered good results in the second quarter in a difficult operating environment,” said Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer David Taylor. “Stronger top-line performance in the first half of the fiscal year is enabling us to increase our organic sales growth outlook for the full year - another step towards the levels of balanced top-line, bottom-line, and cash flow growth that will consistently put P&G shareholder value creation among the best in our industry.” October - December Quarter Discussion Net sales in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 were $16.9 billion, unchanged versus prior year, including a negative two percent impact from foreign exchange. Organic sales increased two percent driven by a two percent increase in organic shipment volume. Pricing and mix had no net impact on sales for the quarter. All-in volume increased one percent including the impacts of minor brand divestitures and lost sales to Venezuelan subsidiaries.

Beauty segment organic sales increased three percent versus year ago behind growth in both Hair Care and Skin & Personal Care. Organic sales increased in Skin & Personal Care due to the continued growth of the super-premium SK-II skin care brand. Organic sales increased in Hair Care due to innovation and marketing support on the Pantene and Head & Shoulders brands. Grooming segment organic sales increased one percent due to innovation-driven volume growth in both Shave Care and Appliances. Organic sales increased low single digits globally in Shave Care as higher volume outside the U.S. from innovation and increased marketing support more than offset negative competitive impacts in the U.S. Organic sales were up low single digits in Appliances driven by the continued success of premium innovation across the top markets. Health Care segment organic sales increased seven percent behind higher organic volume in both Oral Care and Personal Health Care. Product innovation drove a high single digit increase in organic sales in Oral Care, while Personal Health Care organic sales increased low single digits primarily due to market growth. Fabric and Home Care segment organic sales increased one percent versus year ago driven by higher volume from innovation and marketing investments in Fabric Care along with increased pricing in Home Care. Fabric Care and Home Care organic sales both increased low single digits. Baby, Feminine and Family Care segment organic sales increased one percent driven by organic volume growth in all three businesses. Baby care volume increased behind product innovation, increased marketing support and market growth. Feminine Care and Family Care organic volume growth was driven by product innovation. Organic sales increased low single digits in Feminine Care and mid-single digits in Family Care while decreasing low single digits in Baby Care due to increased promotional investments. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.93, a decrease of eight percent versus the base period. Diluted net earnings per share were $2.88, an increase of 157% versus the prior year. Current year results included a $1.95 per share gain from discontinued operations from the Beauty Brands divestiture to Coty, which closed on October 1, 2016, non-core restructuring charges of $0.03 per share and a non-core charge for early debt retirement of $0.13 per share. Core earnings per share, which exclude non-core restructuring charges, early debt retirement fees and the results of discontinued operations, were $1.08, an increase of four percent versus the prior year. Currency-neutral core earnings per share increased nine percent for the quarter. Reported gross margin increased 80 basis points, including a 10 basis point benefit from lower non-core restructuring charges. Core gross margin improved 70 basis points, including 50 basis points of negative foreign exchange impacts. On a currency-neutral basis, core gross margin increased 120 basis points, driven by 210 basis points of productivity cost savings partially offset by headwinds from unfavorable mix and commodity cost increases. Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) as a percent of sales increased 60 basis points on a reported basis versus the prior year, including a 10 basis point net benefit from a year-on-year decline in non-core restructuring charges. Core SG&A as a percentage of sales increased 70 basis points, including 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. On a currency-neutral basis, core SG&A was up 60 basis points versus the prior year as increased investments in marketing activities were partially offset by productivity savings. Reported operating profit margin increased 20 basis points. Core operating profit margin was in-line with the prior year, including 60 basis points of foreign exchange impacts. On a currency-neutral basis, core operating profit margin increased 60 basis points driven by productivity cost savings of 230 basis points for the quarter. Fiscal Year 2017 Guidance P&G said it is raising its guidance for organic sales growth from approximately two percent to a range of two to three percent for fiscal 2017. The Company now expects the combined headwinds of foreign exchange and minor brand divestitures to reduce sales growth by two to three percentage points. As a result, P&G estimates all-in sales to be in line with the prior fiscal year. The Company maintained its expectation for core earnings per share growth of mid-single digits versus fiscal 2016 core EPS of $3.67. All-in GAAP earnings per share are expected to increase 48% to 50% versus fiscal year 2016 GAAP EPS of $3.69. The fiscal 2017 GAAP EPS estimate includes approximately $0.12 per share of non-core restructuring costs and $0.13 per share of charges related to early debt retirement that was executed in the second fiscal quarter. Also included in GAAP EPS is the $1.95 gain from the divestiture of 41 Beauty Brands to Coty in a transaction that was completed on October 1, 2016.

accordance with the SEC's Regulation G, the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures used in Procter & Gamble's January 20, 2017 earnings release and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends (i.e. trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by Management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items: Incremental restructuring: The Company has had and continues to have an ongoing level of restructuring activities. Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. Beginning in 2012 Procter & Gamble began a $10 billion strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that includes incremental restructuring activities. This results in incremental restructuring charges to accelerate productivity efforts and cost savings. The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs. Early debt extinguishment charges: During the three months ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded a charge of $345 million after tax due to the early extinguishment of certain long-term debt. This charge represents the difference between the reacquisition price and the par value of the debt extinguished. Management does not view this charge as indicative of the Company’s operating performance or underlying business results. We do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results and their exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. Both of these items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation. Organic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. Management believes this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. Core operating profit margin: Core operating profit margin is a measure of the Company's operating margin adjusted for items as indicated. Management believes this non-GAAP measure provides a supplemental perspective to the Company’s operating efficiency over time. Core gross margin: Core gross margin is a measure of the Company's gross margin adjusted for items as indicated. Management believes this non-GAAP measure provides a supplemental perspective to the Company’s operating efficiency over time. Core EPS and currency-neutral Core EPS: Core earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated. Currency-neutral Core EPS is a measure of the Company's Core EPS excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management views these non-GAAP measures as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. Adjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding tax payments related to the Beauty Brands divestiture, which are non-recurring and not considered indicative of underlying cash flow performance. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. Management views adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment. Adjusted free cash flow productivity: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the loss on early debt extinguishment and gain on the sale of the Beauty Brands, which are non-recurring and not considered indicative of underlying earnings performance. Management views adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent.   THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions Except Per Share

Shares of the company, which makes Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, were up as much as 3.9 percent in afternoon trading on Friday. P&G has been shedding unprofitable brands as it focuses on core brands, including Tide and Gillette, to boost sales. The company sold 41 of its brands last year, including Clairol and COVERGIRL, to Coty Inc for $12.5 billion. (http://reut.rs/2jfL6nV) The company's total organic sales, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange, mergers and acquisitions, rose 2 percent as pricing and product mix remained flat. P&G's health care unit, which sells Oral-B and Vicks, was its best performing business with organic sales jumping 7 percent. Its beauty business, which houses brands like Head & Shoulders and Olay, rose 3 percent. The health care and beauty business together accounted for about 30 percent of P&G's total sales. P&G said it now expects organic sales growth of 2 percent to 3 percent for the year, up from its prior forecast of a 2 percent increase. This is faster than the 1 percent organic sales growth P&G reported in 2016. However, headwinds from foreign exchange and further pruning of its portfolio will reduce overall sales growth in 2017 by 2 to 3 percentage points, the Cincinnati, Ohio-based company said. P&G's product pruning strategy, including the sale of its beauty brands to Coty, is proving effective, Argus Research Corp analyst John Staszak told Reuters. Core earnings per share, which excludes restructuring charges and other items, was $1.08 in the second quarter ended Dec. 31. Analysts expected a profit of $1.06 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to the company rose to $7.88 billion, or $2.88 per share, from $3.21 billion, or $1.12 per share, a year earlier. The latest quarter included a gain from discontinued operations, including brands sold to Coty. The company's net sales of $16.85 billion were largely flat and included a 2 percentage point foreign exchange impact. Still, those sales beat Wall Street's estimates of $16.77 billion. Up to Thursday's close, P&G's shares had risen 11.7 percent in the past 12 months.

Kevin’s first book, Ways of Staying, won the 2010 South African Literary Award for literary journalism, and was shortlisted for the Alan Paton Award. He is currently working on a book about a changing Africa. South Africa 19 Jan 2017 11:08 (South Africa) Ten years ago, the signs were everywhere. The “2007 pet food scandal”, for instance, which snuffed out the lives of thousands of pets in North America, Europe and South Africa, was just another tear in the fabric, one more clue that behind the curtain were a bunch of deranged clowns who controlled all the information. But because the pet food scandal had a local slant, and because the facts were so skilfully discombobulated, there was something a little special about this particular harbinger of the inauguration of President Trump. By KEVIN BLOOM. In case you didn’t know it, “dog” is “God” spelt backwards. Here’s something else that maybe you didn’t know about dogs. The global pet food industry is run by humanity’s most amazing multinational corporations. They’re so amazing, these corporations, that the most recognisable of them – Nestlé – admitted last year to instances of slavery (!) in its Thailand operation while continuing to fight a child labour lawsuit in Ivory Coast. So amazing that another of them known for dabbling in forced labour in Indonesia – Colgate-Palmolive – remains the only company in the United States that still laces its toothpaste with a chemical banned from soap. So amazing that the CEO of the one with a customer base of nearly 5-billion people – Proctor and Gamble – said some wonderful things recently about “not overwhelming consumers with too much choice”, even though he’d been a little less talkative about a) the arrest of nine Greenpeace activists at his company headquarters in Cincinnati, and b) the accusations against him of large-scale tax fraud in Argentina. Thank Dog, then, that our pets are being fed from the hands of such responsible corporate citizens. And thank Dog for Donald Trump, who, when he was still in the race to be the planet’s Top Dog, let us know how dog-tired he was of all the pet food recalls being ordered all the time by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). “The FDA food police,” was how the Trump campaign put it in a fact sheet back in September 2016, “which dictate how the federal government expects farmers to produce fruits and vegetables and even dictates the nutritional content of dog food.” If you didn’t get the significance of that “even” the first time, the fact sheet was kind enough to repeat it for you in the next sentence. “The rules govern the soil farmers use, farm and food production hygiene, food packaging, food temperatures and even [italics ours] what animals may roam which fields and when.” Yup, according to the Trump presidential campaign, Big Government wasn’t only interfering in the inalienable rights of all God-fearing Americans to put whatever junk they wanted into their own Goddamn mouths, it was even interfering in the inalienable rights of beings with no Goddamn rights whatsoever, being (non-God-fearing) animals. The “nutritional content” of dog food? For real? For real. The FDA was (is?) un-American. But hindsight, as someone once said, is an exact science. Now that Trump has won and the Chairman (and CEO) of ExxonMobil is about to become the most powerful foreign diplomat in the known universe, it’s all so blindingly obvious. Nestlé, Colgate-Palmolive and Proctor and Gamble (not to forget Del Monte Foods, Marc Inc. and Mogiana Alimentos) sit atop a global pet food market of $70-billion, and it has never been in their interests to give a fuck about the “true” nutritional value of their products. There was a time, of course, when they used to pretend to give a fuck – a time when the FDA wasn’t seen as a tool of liberal stooges, a time when poisoning by salmonella actually meant something to POTUS and his administration, a time when the swindles and fixes and collusions were still subtle, cunning, appropriately difficult to spot. The year 2007, for instance, which would one day be remembered for the eponymous “2007 pet food recalls”. If there was any occasion when the pet food industry needed to come together and pretend to give a fuck, it was this. The crisis flared up in March, with veterinary organisations reporting more than 100 pet deaths linked to ingestion of the industrial chemical melamine. Less than two weeks into April, one online database was reporting 3,600 deaths. Although the first recalls were announced in the United States by Menu Foods (a contract manufacturer for Proctor and Gamble), the ensuing months would see the recalls spread throughout North America and across the Atlantic into Europe and South Africa. The affected brands would eventually include such well-known doggy and kitty staples as Nestlé Purina Petcare, Hill’s Pet Nutrition (a subsidiary of Colgate-Palmolive), Royal Canin (a subsidiary of Mars, Inc) and more than a dozen brands owned by American processed foods giant Del Monte. In May 2008, down in South Africa, a superhero consumer journalist by the name of Wendy Knowler decided to assess the damage to the industry. Under the header “Wonder nutrition or modern scourge?”, Knowler published an article in The Star that asked whether South Africans had suffered a crisis of confidence in their pet food. “Apparently not,” she concluded, citing the executive director of the Pet Food Industry Association of Southern Africa, who noted that the local market had grown over the previous year by two percent, mainly because of the “upfront way” in which manufacturers had responded to the crisis. Knowler, shifting up into “bullshit alert” gear, explained it like this: “What the industry has always done very well is discourage pet owners from feeding their cats and dogs anything which doesn’t come out of a bag, pouch or tin.” In other words, no table scraps, no home-cooked meals, no raw meat, and no bones. “In the case of the ‘premium’ brands sold at veterinary practices,” she continued (for ‘premium’ brands, ref above), “the vets strongly advise pet owners to feed their animals solely on packaged food. Coming from someone with a medical degree, it’s a very powerful endorsement. And it’s backed by the SA Veterinary Association.” Implication being, some dissenting voices were accusing the processed pet food industry of orchestrating a giant scam. As Australian vet Dr Tom Lonsdale, author of the book Work Wonders: Feed Your Dog Raw Meaty Bones, told Knowler: “We as a profession have been led by the nose by vested interests into the current situation, where younger vets actually recommend commercial pet foods as the best available way of feeding domestic pets.” Knowler had a simpler phrase for it, which she borrowed from the (human) medical profession: “perverse incentives”. Remember the movie Love & Other Drugs, directed by Edward Zwick, which was based on the non-fiction book by Jamie Reidy Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman? Yes? Well, it goes something like that – a rep for one of the big pharma companies takes the doc to lunch, gets the doc drunk, pays for the doc’s island holiday (listed, in the financial statements, as a medical conference). In South Africa, referring again to the human medical profession, these practices were mostly outlawed in 2004 with the passing of the Perverse Incentives Policy, implemented as part of the Marketing Code of the Medicines Control Act. But walk into almost any non-human medical practice in this country and you’re likely to see the reception area packed floor to ceiling with pellets from the above-mentioned “premium” brands. It was true when Knowler’s article was published, and it’s true today. Knowler wrote about a 2007 congress for vets at Sun City paid for by Colgate-Palmolive’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition; today you’ll find the same company paying for the Hill’s Global Symposium in Hollywood, a physical and virtual event designed to “inspire and educate veterinarians and veterinary health care team members to use nutrition to improve pets’ lives”. So what to do? Paul Jacobson, owner of Vondi’s Holistic Pet Nutrition – yes, it’s really a thing, and yes, it was founded in Cape Town – said this to Daily Maverick: “You don’t need to spend more on premium, they’re no better for your dogs or cats than the cheap brands, like Epol.” Sure, Jacobson was talking his own book – which happens to be “all-natural home cooked” – and sure, for every study that says dried kibble pellets are not an appropriate food for your pet, there’s another study (or 10) saying the opposite. But the debate is not the point. The point is the deranged clowns behind the curtain who are controlling the information. It’s not 2007 any more, Dorothy, and we’re no longer in Kansas. In the last decade, we’ve learned what the private funding of extreme pro-corporate politics can actually do to a planet. While the oil and gas conglomerates have been funnelling billions of dollars into a giant misinformation campaign that pretends to discredit the science behind climate change, the $1.5-trillion Big Food conglomerates have been throwing their money and weight around the developed world’s capitals, casting shade at the (pretty indisputable) fact that the agricultural sector emits more greenhouse gases than transportation, and that monocultures – as former US president Barack Obama said in 2008 – are “partly responsible for the explosion in our healthcare costs because they’re contributing to Type 2 diabetes, stroke and heart disease, obesity.” President Trump, even if he doesn’t do to the “FDA Food Police” what he threatened to do during the 2016 campaign, will never utter a sentence like that. Which as of today means that Big Food – ie. the conglomerates that also control the global pet food industry – can be a lot less coy about getting what it wants. And that’s not just bad news for the dogs. DM Photo by EmmyMic via Flickr.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Jan 20, 2017 at 5:18PM Image source: Getty Images. Stocks rose on Friday as both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) indexes finished higher by more than 0.25%. Today's stock market Index Percentage Change Point Change Dow 0.48% 94.85 S&P 500 0.34% 7.62 Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Financial stocks remained popular on a day that saw a new administration take over the executive branch, and that kept the Financial Sector Select SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLF) among the most heavily traded exchange-traded funds. Meanwhile, gold price volatility swung in the positive direction for owners of the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF (NYSEMKT:NUGT), which gained 3% on the day. As for individual stocks, Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) stood out with big moves higher. Procter & Gamble keeps its momentum going Procter & Gamble shares gained 3% following the release of surprisingly strong quarterly earnings results. For the second straight quarter, the consumer goods giant enjoyed healthy volume-driven revenue growth as organic sales rose by 2%. That result was a slowdown from the prior quarter's 3% boost, and it wasn't quite enough to end P&G's overall market share slide. However, it was still a solid performance given intense competition and an overall flat industry. "We delivered good results in the second quarter in a difficult operating environment," CEO David Taylor said in a press release. Image source: P&G. Cost cuts pushed profitability higher despite increased investments in marketing and product innovation. P&G's gross margin rose by more than a percentage point, in fact, and its operating profit margin jumped by 2.3 percentage points. The company's earnings surged higher due to a one-time benefit from its Coty beauty product sales. Stripping that out still left core profit up by 9%. That success puts P&G on track to achieve its long-run target of at least 5% annual earnings growth in 2017 after posting a 2% decline in each of the last two fiscal years. Yet the best news for investors is that the company sees reason for optimism on the top line. P&G raised its full-year organic sales outlook to 2.5% from 2%. Skyworks beats expectations Skyworks solutions shares rallied 13% higher after the company beat its sales guidance and issued an aggressive outlook for the current quarter. Revenue declined for the third straight quarter, but its $914 million sales figure was ahead of management's forecast. The same trend held for earnings, with the semiconductor specialist producing $1.61 per share of profit compared to the $1.58 per share executives had targeted. "Skyworks delivered exceptional financial results...fueled by global demand for ubiquitous mobile connectivity and the Internet of Things," CEO Liam Griffin said in a press release. "We are enabling the next phase of the wireless revolution," he continued, "powering new and previously unimagined applications." The fiscal second quarter is usually a slow period for the industry following the surge in consumer product sales in the first quarter. However, Skyworks thinks that its broader product pipeline will allow it to buck that trend and show solid growth for the first time in a year. The company predicts an 8% sales boost for the current quarter to $840 million as earnings rise to $1.40 per share. Consensus estimates were much less optimistic, modeling $818 million of sales and $1.24 per share of revenue. As a result, investors are raising their expectations, and lifting Skyworks' stock price in the process. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Earnings Give Investors Something to Celebrate The consumer goods titan enjoyed broad sales growth and surging profits in its fiscal second quarter. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Jan 20, 2017 at 4:07PM Heading into this week's earnings report, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) investors had high hopes that the consumer goods giant would break away from rivals by posting improved growth following back-to-back fiscal years of disappointing gains. On Friday, P&G largely delivered on that promise by announcing healthy sales and profit figures for its fiscal second quarter. Here's how the big-picture results stacked up against the prior-year period.   Metric Q4 2016 Actuals Q4 2015 Actuals Growth (YOY) Revenue $16.9 billion $16.9 billion N/A Net income $7.9 billion $3.2 billion 145% EPS $3.01 $1.16 159% Data source: P&G financial filings. Quarters are calendar quarters and represent fiscal Q2. Sales and profits Reported sales were flat, but that number is being held back by foreign currency swings and the lingering effects of P&G's brand divestment initiative. Organic sales strip out those temporary shifts to focus only on actual growth. That figure came to 2% for the quarter, marking a slight slowdown from the prior quarter's 3% gain. However, it was above management's forecast. Looking deeper, organic volume rose in each of P&G's five product divisions for the second straight quarter. The best performances came in grooming, home to the blockbuster Gillette shaving franchise, and healthcare, which is led by Crest toothpaste. Each of these segments posted a 4% volume spike, suggesting increased -- or at least flat -- market share. Image source: Getty Images. The company's main global rivals, Unilever (NYSE:UL) and Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB), don't post their results until next week. But P&G's latest sales numbers could close the performance gap between it and its peers. Kimberly-Clark lowered its growth forecast three months ago while Unilever warned of slowing demand in its biggest markets. In contrast, Procter & Gamble has now managed a slight acceleration in volume over each of the last two quarters. As expected, profits surged higher thanks mainly to a one-time benefit from P&G's sale of the Coty beauty product line. Strip that out, though, and it's clear that the company is enjoying healthy earnings growth. Cost cuts helped core earnings jump by 9% to outpace management's long-term goal of around 5% annual gains. Profits are right on pace to rise by at least that much this year after two consecutive years of 2% declines. Management and outlook "We delivered good results in a difficult operating environment," CEO David Taylor said in a press release. Executives were pleased that the company could, despite a sluggish market and fierce competition, move closer to its goal of volume-driven sales growth that powers solid earnings gains. The business took "another step toward the levels of balanced top-line, bottom-line, and cash flow growth that will consistently put P&G shareholder value creation amount the best in our industry," Taylor explained. P&G's big-picture goals. Image source: P&G investor presentation. Buoyed by the two-quarter stretch of surprisingly strong sales growth, Taylor and his team raised their growth forecast for the first time in over two years. They now see organic revenue improving by about 2.5% rather than the 2% they initially projected. That would likely be enough to outpace Kimberly-Clark's gains and is significantly ahead of the 1% uptick P&G endured in fiscal 2016. Overall, shareholders should be happy with this report since it shows exactly the type of market-leading sales and profit growth that P&G has been promising would come from the recently concluded transformation process that sliced 100 brands, and billions of dollars of expenses, from the business.

January 20, 2017 RTGE Staff Subscribe Plastics The consumer products company Procter & Gamble Co., Cincinnati, has announced that its Head & Shoulders shampoo brand will become the first recyclable shampoo bottle made from up to 25 percent recycled beach plastic. P&G, in partnership with TerraCycle and Suez Environnement, based in Paris, will begin the recycling program in France by the middle of this year, producing a limited-edition shampoo bottle. The shampoo will be sold through the retailer Carrefour. The product will be the world’s largest production run of recyclable bottles made with postconsumer recycled beach plastic and a first major step in establishing a unique supply chain that involves the support of thousands of volunteers and hundreds of NGOs collecting plastic scrap found on beaches, the company says.  "We felt that the leading shampoo brand in sales should lead in sustainability innovation and know that when we do this, it encourages the entire industry to do the same,” says Lisa Jennings, vice president, Head & Shoulders and Global Hair Care Sustainability Leader for Procter & Gamble. “We've been fortunate to work with such great partners in TerraCycle and Suez to make this vision a reality." Additionally, P&G announced that in Europe by end of 2018 more than half a billion bottles per year of its hair care products will include up to 25 percent postconsumer recycled plastic. P&G says the total represents more than 90 percent of all the hair care bottles it sold in Europe across P&G’s hair care portfolio of brands. The project will require about 2,600 tons of recycled plastic every year. “At P&G, we believe that actions speak louder than words. The increased use of PCR plastic across our hair care portfolio of brands, demonstrate our continued commitment to driving real change,” says Virginie Helias, P&G’s vice president of Global Sustainability. “The Head & Shoulders recyclable shampoo bottle made with beach plastic is a world’s first in the hair care category. Increasing the use of recycled plastic in the packaging of our flagship brands, like Pantene and Head & Shoulders, makes it easier for consumers to choose more sustainable products, without any trade-offs. So, while we’re proud of what we’ve done and what we’re doing, we know there is much more work ahead.” Tom Szaky, CEO, TerraCycle, says, “This partnership represents an important step for TerraCycle. We are proud to be working with one of the world’s largest brands to create a breakthrough product. Creating the world’s first recyclable shampoo bottle with beach plastics is a start of an important journey. With the circular economy gaining more traction, we hope that other global brands will work with green suppliers and use their influence to drive change for the benefit of the environment.” “This partnership between SUEZ, TerraCycle and P&G represents an exciting step in the creation of a world first for consumers, a recyclable shampoo bottle made of beach plastics," says Jean-Marc Boursier, Suez group senior executive vice president in charge of Recycling & Recovery Europe. "We hope that other organizations will continue to partner with different providers in order to deliver major environmental changes in this industry and hopefully across other industries too. With nine dedicated plastic facilities across Europe, Suez is already producing 170,000 tons of high-quality recycled polymers."

(GuruFocus) Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG) shares are trading higher by $2.89 (3.5 percent) at $87.59 in Friday's session. The catalyst for the 3 percent rally is a Q4 EPS beat of $0.02 along with a slight revenue beat. After a much higher open, it retreated $0.47 to $86.42 before resuming its move higher. It has continued to make new highs for the day as the current one stands at $87.64. That high is just shy of its November 8 high of $87.69, as well as its October 26 high of $87.74.

"We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs," Trump said after being sworn in. "Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my body and I will never ever let you down." The Dow Jones industrial average gained about 95 points after rising 111.54 points at session highs, with Procter & Gamble, Merck and IBM contributing the most gains. The blue-chips index also snapped a five-day losing streak. "It was a very populist speech. He spoke to the Heartland; he spoke to those who voted for him," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "Clearly, it was not what a lot of people were expecting. It was vintage Trump. The S&P 500 gained 0.3 percent, with telecommunications and materials leading advancers. The Nasdaq composite advanced 0.28 percent. The three major indexes had traded more than half a percent higher ahead of Trump's speech. S&P intraday chartSource: FactSet "He didn't decide to go high. He decided to go populist and protectionist, and that's something we're going to have to get used to. When you put together populism and protectionism, it has a lot of economic fallout. That's how he got here," said aid Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. "We were going higher on the hopes of thing that take time to happen in Washington." The broader stock market has rallied significantly since Trump's shocking electoral victory on the hopes of more government spending, lower corporate taxes and deregulation of some sectors. Stocks, however, have traded mostly sideways for the past month as investors look for more details about Trump's proposed policies. The Trump administration will have to start delivering on these expectations for stocks to remain at current levels, said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets. "Traders are no longer going to monitor his words closely, but the actual actions. The bigger question is if he can get the Congress to wear the same hat," he said. Equities had pulled back slightly leading up to the inauguration, with the benchmark indexes all tracking for weekly losses heading into Friday's session. Getty Images Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. "What I've noticed over the past couple of days is we've seen a lot of activity in put options," said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. "What this tells me is people are preparing for a pullback, which may not happen." "We saw something similar happen ahead of the election," Frederick said. "The first 100 days are going to be critical. We've got pretty high expectations for GDP and, if they are met, there is room for valuation expansion." Expectations for a stronger economy have not only been bolstered by policy hopes from the new administration, but also by the slew of better-than-expected economic data. Weekly jobless claims remain around their lowest levels in decades, while the consumer price index rose 2.1 percent in December on a year-over-year basis. In fact, the Citi U.S. Economic Surprise index has risen to its highest level since 2014. A higher reading on the index indicates more positive economic data surprises. Citi U.S. Economic Surprise index 3-year chartSource: FactSet Jeff Zipper, managing director of investments at the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank, said the economic backdrop is bullish for stocks. He added, however, "the market is definitely looking for some clarity" on Trump's policy plans. There are no major economic data due Friday. Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker said in a speech the U.S. labor participation rate is lower than he would like, and is holding down productivity and growth. In corporate news, earnings season continued as Dow components General Electric and Procter & Gamble both reported quarterly results. GE posted in-line adjusted earnings per share while revenue came slightly below estimates. P&G's results topped estimates on both the top and bottom lines. U.S. Treasury yields gave back some gains Friday after Trump's speech, with the benchmark 10-year note yield trading around 2.489 percent and the two-year note yield near 1.19 percent. "The truth is we don't know where this is going," said John Bredemus, vice president for Allianz Investment Management. "Uncertainty is not just on the Trump administration, it's also on monetary policy as the Fed steps back." Overseas, European equities traded mostly flat ahead of the inauguration, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index falling just 0.07 percent. In Asia, stocks closed mixed, as the Korean Kospi fell 0.35 percent, while the Shanghai composite advanced 0.7 percent. Symbol Name Price   Change %Change DJIA --- S&P 500 --- NASDAQ --- The Dow Jones industrial average gained 94.85 points, or 0.48 percent, to close at 19,827.25, with Merck leading advancers and General Electric the biggest decliner. The S&P 500 rose 7.62 points, or 0.34 percent, to end at 2,271.31, with telecommunications leading nine sectors higher and industrials and health care lagging. The Nasdaq composite advanced 15.25 points, or 0.28 percent, to close at 5,555.33. About nine stocks advanced for every five decliners at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 980.63 million and a composite volume of 3.502 billion at the close. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded near 11.5.

(Photo: The Cincinnati Enquirer) 75 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE CINCINNATI — Procter & Gamble reported a $ 7.9 billion second-quarter profit Friday — a 146% increase from the same period a year earlier. P&G's (PG) profits were given a $5.3-billion gain on the divestiture of beauty brands. Total sales declined 0.3% to  $16.86 billion. Organic sales, a closely watched metric that exclude the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures, rose by 2%. Earnings per diluted share were $2.88, while core EPS was $1.08 — beating Wall Street expectations of $1.06 in core earnings. P&G shares shot up as high as $2.58, or 3%, to $87.28 in early Friday trading. P&G closed Thursday at $84.70, down 0.27%, or 23 cents. Wall Street analysts had expected the Cincinnati-based company to report a $3-billion profit excluding one-time items on sales of $16.8 billion, according to Bloomberg. Last year, the company reported a  $3.2 billion profit on sales of $16.92 billion for the second quarter. USA TODAY Is bad news ahead after P&G changes earnings release date? "We delivered good results in the second quarter in a difficult operating environment," said CEO David Taylor, in a statement. "Stronger top-line performance in the first half of the fiscal year is enabling us to increase our organic sales growth outlook for the full year." The company's improved performance was driven by a 1% increase in sales volume, while pricing and product mix were flat. The quarter's results were the first posted by P&G reflecting its slimmer product portfolio, featuring about 65 brands. In early October, the company completed a split-off with nearly a third of its beauty business. The challenge going forward is for P&G to reignite sales growth at its remaining core businesses of Tide detergent, Gillette razors, Pampers diapers and other household staples. P&G beat expectations during the first quarter reported in October but was expected to have a harder time beating year-ago second quarter results that were more robust. P&G increased its organic sales forecast Friday, saying it now expects that metric to increase 2% to 3% for the fiscal year ending June 30, up from its previous forecast of a 2% increase. Still, foreign exchange was expected to have a bigger impact on total sales, which are now expected to be flat, compared with a previous forecast of 1% growth.

The company reported organic sales growth across its segments, and shares rose 1.8% to $86.25 in premarket trading Friday. P&G has struggled for years to accelerate sales growth facing slowing demand for its consumer staples like fabric softener and increased competition from new smaller & nimbler rivals. The company determined a focus on areas like salon products and designer perfumes that distracted from core areas and hurt its growth. In June 2015, P&G announced it would shed brands such as Wella shampoos, Clairol hair dye and CoverGirl makeup and merge them with Coty Inc. in a complicated deal originally valued at $13 billion. The report Friday marked P&G's first since it unloaded the bulk of the beauty business to Coty; the deal closed last fall. P&G reported net income of $7.88 billion, or $2.88 a share, compared with year-ago earnings of $3.21 billion, or $1.12 a share. On an adjusted basis, excluding gains from the sale, the company said it earned $1.08 a share, slightly above analysts' projections for $1.06 a share. Sales edged lower to $16.86 billion from $16.92 billion a year ago, less of a drop-off than the $16.77 billion analysts were expecting. P&G has shown recently it is able to cut costs but had yet to deliver on a promise to meaningfully increase revenue. Investors have been looking for P&G to post improved organic-sales growth, a measure that strips out currency moves, acquisitions and divestments. The company said organic sales increased 2% driven by a 2% increase in organic shipment volume, as pricing and mix had no net impact on quarterly sales. --Imani Moise contributed to this article.

(PG) on Friday reported a profit for the second quarter that more than doubled from last year on a one-time gain and higher margins, while sales edged lower. Both revenue and core earnings per share for the quarter beat analysts' estimates. In addition, the Cincinnati, Ohio-based maker of Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste and Gillette shaving razors affirmed its outlook for fiscal 2017 core earnings and raised its outlook for organic sales growth. For the second quarter, net earnings attributable to P&G rose to $7.88 billion or $2.88 per share from $3.21 billion or $1.12 per share in the prior-year period. Earnings per share for the latest quarter includes a gain of $1.95 per share from the Beauty Brands divestiture to Coty. Core earnings per share were $1.08, compared to $1.04 per share last year. Currency-neutral core earnings increased 9 percent from the prior year period. On average, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected the company to earn $1.06 per share for the quarter. Analysts' estimates typically exclude special items. Net sales for the quarter edged down to $16.86 billion from $16.92 billion in the prior year. Analysts had a consensus revenue estimate of $16.77 billion. Sales for the quarter include a negative two percentage impact from foreign exchange. Organic sales increased 2 percent, driven by a two percent increase in organic shipment volume. Organic sales and organic volume increased in all five business segments. All-in volume increased one percent including the impacts of minor brand divestitures and lost sales to Venezuelan subsidiaries. Gross margin expanded 80 basis points to 50.8 percent, while operating margin increased 20 basis points to 23.0 percent. Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, P&G affirmed its outlook for core earnings per share growth of mid-single digits versus fiscal 2016 core earnings per share of $3.67. However, the company raised its outlook for organic sales growth to a range of 2 to 3 percent from the prior outlook of about 2 percent. P&G now expects the combined headwinds of foreign exchange and minor brand divestitures to reduce sales growth for the year by about 2 to 3 percentage points, from the prior forecast of about 1 percentage point. As a result, the company now estimates all-in sales growth for fiscal 2017 to be in line with the prior year, compared to its prior outlook for growth of about one percent. Analysts expect the company to report earnings of $3.84 per share for the year on revenues of $65.15 billion. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News The World's 10 Most Productive Nations, Ranked Biotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In February In Memorium: Business Giants We Lost In 2016 More Top Stories Trump Signs Order Instituting "Extreme Vetting" Of Immigrants Stocks Close Roughly Flat For Second Straight Day - U.S. Commentary Abercrombie & Fitch Issues 150 Pink Slips Trump Discusses Mexico, Russia, Brexit In News Conference With May Trump To Speak With Putin By Phone On Saturday Feds Claim Breathometer Made False Claims About Accuracy Trump Expresses Support For "Nuclear Option" Over Supreme Court Nominee Stocks Continue To Lack Direction In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary Stocks Continue To Experience Choppy Trading - U.S. Commentary Report: Wet Seal Will Go Extinct Trump Accuses Mexico Of Taking Advantage Of U.S. Study Shows How Jet Lag Affects Baseball Teams McDonald's Sells All Of Its Nordic Restaurants U.S. Consumer Sentiment Reaches Thirteen-Year High In January Tim Hortons Coming To Mexico <<Previous        103 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus RELATED NEWS Procter & Gamble Co.

Wegen des starken Dollar verharrten die Erlöse im zweiten Geschäftsquartal (Ende Dezember) auf dem Vorjahresniveau von 16,9 Milliarden US-Dollar, wie der Hersteller von Pampers-Windeln, Gillette-Rasierern oder Pantene-Shampoo am Freitag mitteilte. Der Gewinn schnellte hingegen auf 7,9 Milliarden Dollar in die Höhe. Dies war mehr als doppelt soviel wie die im Vorjahr erzielten 3,2 Milliarden Dollar. Der starke Anstieg war dem Verkauf etlicher Kosmetikmarken an den Parfümkonzern Coty geschuldet, der im Oktober abgeschlossen wurde.

Shares of the company, which raised its fiscal 2017 forecast for organic sales growth, were up 2 per cent before the bell on Friday. P&G has been shedding unprofitable brands as it focuses on core brands, including Tide and Gillette, to boost sales. The company sold 41 of its brands last year, including Clairol and COVERGIRL, to Coty Inc for $12.5-billion. Cincinnati, Ohio-based P&G said its core earnings per share, which excludes restructuring charges and other items, was $1.08, in the second quarter ended Dec. 31. Analysts expected a profit of $1.06 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to the company rose to $7.88-billion, or $2.88 per share, from $3.21-billion, or $1.12 per share, a year earlier. The latest quarter included a gain from discontinued operations, including brands sold to Coty. Net sales of $16.85-billion came in ahead of Wall Street estimates of $16.77-billion. “Stronger top-line performance in the first half of the fiscal year is enabling us to increase our organic sales growth outlook for the full year,” Chief Executive David Taylor said in a statement.

The Cincinnati-based packaged goods giant reported fiscal Q2 EPS of $1.08, which was $0.02 better than the Wall Street consensus estimate of $1.06. Revenues fell 0.3% from last year to $16.86 billion, but still topped analysts’ view for $16.77 billion. P&G noted that organic sales increased 2% from the year-ago period, helped by a matching increase in organic shipment volume. Pricing and product mix did not have any impact on sales in fiscal Q2. All five business segments saw organic sales gains in the latest quarter, with Beauty organic sales up 3%, Grooming +1%, Health Care +7%, Fabric & Home Care +1%, and Baby, Feminine & Family Care +1%. Looking ahead, Procter & Gamble reaffirmed its previously announced full-year 2017 EPS guidance. It still expects “mid single digit” adjusted EPS growth, which is in-line with Wall Street’s current $3.85 estimate. P&G also expects revenues to be in-line with last year’s $67.17 billion, which would top analysts’ view for sales of $65.17 billion. Finally, P&G boosted its organic sales growth guidance from the two percent level to a range of two to three percent for fiscal 2017. The company commented via press release: “We delivered good results in the second quarter in a difficult operating environment,” said Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer David Taylor. “Stronger top-line performance in the first half of the fiscal year is enabling us to increase our organic sales growth outlook for the full year – another step towards the levels of balanced top-line, bottom-line, and cash flow growth that will consistently put P&G shareholder value creation among the best in our industry.” Procter & Gamble Co shares fell $0.65 (-0.77%) in premarket trading Friday. Year-to-date, PG has gained 0.74%, versus a 1.06% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. PG currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #1 of 16 stocks in the Consumer Goods category. This article is brought to you courtesy of StockNews.com.

Shares of the company, which makes Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, were up as much as 3.9 percent in afternoon trading on Friday. P&G has been shedding unprofitable brands as it focuses on core brands, including Tide and Gillette, to boost sales. The company sold 41 of its brands last year, including Clairol and COVERGIRL, to Coty Inc for $12.5 billion. (http://reut.rs/2jfL6nV) The company's total organic sales, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange, mergers and acquisitions, rose 2 percent as pricing and product mix remained flat. P&G's health care unit, which sells Oral-B and Vicks, was its best performing business with organic sales jumping 7 percent. Its beauty business, which houses brands like Head & Shoulders and Olay, rose 3 percent. The health care and beauty business together accounted for about 30 percent of P&G's total sales. P&G said it now expects organic sales growth of 2 percent to 3 percent for the year, up from its prior forecast of a 2 percent increase. This is faster than the 1 percent organic sales growth P&G reported in 2016. However, headwinds from foreign exchange and further pruning of its portfolio will reduce overall sales growth in 2017 by 2 to 3 percentage points, the Cincinnati, Ohio-based company said. P&G's product pruning strategy, including the sale of its beauty brands to Coty, is proving effective, Argus Research Corp analyst John Staszak told Reuters. Core earnings per share, which excludes restructuring charges and other items, was $1.08 in the second quarter ended Dec. 31. Analysts expected a profit of $1.06 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to the company rose to $7.88 billion, or $2.88 per share, from $3.21 billion, or $1.12 per share, a year earlier. The latest quarter included a gain from discontinued operations, including brands sold to Coty. The company's net sales of $16.85 billion were largely flat and included a 2 percentage point foreign exchange impact. Still, those sales beat Wall Street's estimates of $16.77 billion. Up to Thursday's close, P&G's shares had risen 11.7 percent in the past 12 months.

Short term: Prices are stalling. Intermediate term: Prices are ranging. The projected upper bound is: 86.92. The projected lower bound is: 82.47. The projected closing price is: 84.69. Candlesticks A white body occurred (because prices closed higher than they opened). During the past 10 bars, there have been 9 white candles and 1 black candles for a net of 8 white candles. During the past 50 bars, there have been 30 white candles and 20 black candles for a net of 10 white candles. Three white candles occurred in the last three days. Although these candles were not big enough to create three white soldiers, the steady upward pattern is bullish. Momentum Indicators Momentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators. Stochastic Oscillator One method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 72.2221. This is not an overbought or oversold reading. The last signal was a sell 7 period(s) ago. Relative Strength Index (RSI) The RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 52.89. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a sell 273 period(s) ago. Commodity Channel Index (CCI) The CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is 54. This is not a topping or bottoming area. The last signal was a sell 0 period(s) ago. MACD The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a buy 1 period(s) ago. Rex Takasugi – TD Profile PROCTER & GAMBLE closed down -0.230 at 84.700. Volume was 12% above average (neutral) and Bollinger Bands were 54% narrower than normal.

Volatility is relatively normal as compared to the average volatility over the last 10 periods. Our volume indicators reflect volume flowing into and out of PG.N at a relatively equal pace (neutral).

Procter & Gamble will begin selling its "beach plastics" bottles in France this summerCourtesy of TerraCycle  Terracycle, which collects hard-to-recycle items like cigarette butts and snack wrappers and upcycles them into more useful products, is working with hundreds of NGOs and cleanup organizations to collect plastics from beaches, harbors and other waterways. The French company Suez then processes them so they can be used as recycled raw material. "We are proud to be working with one of the world's largest brands to create a breakthrough product," TerraCycle CEO Tom Szaky said. "With the circular economy gaining more traction, we hope that other global brands will work with green suppliers and use their influence to drive change for the benefit of the environment." The Head & Shoulder shampoo bottles -- made with up to 25 percent beach plastic -- will first be sold as a limited edition in France this summer, with plans to expand in the future. P&G officials say it will be the world's largest production run of recyclable bottles made with post-consumer recycled beach plastic. A TerraCycle spokeswoman says the company has operations in 21 countries and its European offices are the ones involved in the project. Thursday's announcement was made at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Cristina Rojas may be reached at crojas@njadvancemedia.com. Follow her on Twitter @CristinaRojasTT.

USA Today Network Alexander Coolidge, The Cincinnati Enquirer 2:47 p.m. ET Jan. 19, 2017 Procter & Gamble will release its second-quarter earnings Friday, Jan. 20, 2017. (Photo: The Cincinnati Enquirer) CINCINNATI — Procter & Gamble announced this week it will report its second-quarter results Friday. That's the same day President-elect Trump is inaugurated, which is guaranteed to generate an avalanche of news coverage. At least one Wall Street analyst wondered out loud in a report to investors whether the timing of the coming second-quarter results might hint of looming disappointing financials. The analyst noted some companies will time bad news on a Friday "to minimize investor engagement and negative trading." Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said that in the last few years, P&G (PG) has reported its second-quarter results during the last few days of January. Dibadj wrote in a Wednesday note that several investors had asked his firm about the potential implications of the timing, which were finalized Tuesday. "We largely believe there is no fundamental reason beyond the date best suiting scheduling," Dibadj wrote, but conceded a less-favorable possibility: "P&G wants to get bad results out of the way (which may be the case given the cautious language used at its investor day)." USA TODAY Four reasons why P&G doesn't have analysts in a lather Dibadj added P&G might be reporting earlier than normal as a display of efficiency, but he said that was doubtful given the report date was announced with only three days notice. Least likely, Dibadj wrote was there might be a major announcement "like a breakup." P&G executives said the report date was "adjusted to fix a management scheduling issue" but declined to comment further. Wall Street analysts expect P&G to report a $3 billion profit excluding one-time items on sales of $16.8 billion. Last year, the company reported a  $3.2 billion profit on sales of $16.9 billion for the second quarter. P&G beat expectations during the first quarter reported in October but is expected to have a harder time beating year-earlier second-quarter results that were more robust. For more than two years, executives at the maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers have transformed the company into a simpler and hopefully easier-to-grow maker of consumer staples. P&G was down 0.62%, or 53 cents, to $84.40 in afternoon trading Thursday.

Although pioneers in the field, they now differentiate themselves from competitors using artificial intelligence and building a customer connect Corporate espionage has been around for the longest time. At the beginning of the millennium, Procter & Gamble admitted to a spying operation on its competitor Unilever. In January 2010, Google said it had detected a sophisticated cyber attack that resulted in theft of its intellectual property. Closer home, the Delhi Police last year arrested Oil Ministry officials, corporate executives and even a journalist for allegedly leaking classified government documents to energy companies for money. The threat is real, and the stalkers could be competitors and even employees. In such a scenario, can companies keep their strategies and innovations secret? Vishal Gupta and Abhijit Tannu have made it their business to ensure they do. In 2009, the two started Seclore, a security software company which builds products to secure companies’ internal data from being compromised. It provides security solutions in areas of information usage control, digital rights management and data outsourcing. Over the years, the company has travelled a good distance. What began as a project in IIT Bombay in 2008 is now spread across 30 countries. “When we started, nobody was talking about the issues in cyber and digital security that we wanted to address. The challenge then was to convince people that what we were talking about was important. Almost nine years later, everyone is talking about it,” says Mr. Gupta. The idea saw the light of day after the Society for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, an information technology business incubator at IIT Bombay, adopted the project and helped make it a company. “Our challenge now is to differentiate ourselves from the rest,” says Mr. Gupta. For the first few years, the Seclore office was inside the IIT campus. Seclore was a two-member team and the focus was entirely on Indian companies. Today, the company has offices in Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Singapore, Dubai, Riyadh, Amsterdam, New York and San Francisco, and employs about 230 people around the world. When the company started its operations in 2009, they were the only ones interested in digital security, and in that sense, Seclore was the pioneer its field in India. And now, Mr. Gupta adds, they differentiate themselves from their competitors by making the most automated security products using artificial intelligence and analytics. “We are also the only company in the field which touches the end users,” says Mr. Tannu. While explaining their product to an audience in May last year, Mr. Gupta had said, “What is happening to information that needs to go outside of an enterprise, like contracts to lawyers, term sheets to potential investors, customer data to service providers and financial statements to auditors?” This kind of data, he added, “is only covered by non-disclosure agreements and faith in God.” So what Seclore does is protect the information going out of the enterprise. The way itdoes it is by making the information aware of who is supposed to access it, what are each of these people supposed to do, when and from where. “Now because the information itself is aware of its own security, the security of the information becomes independent of the securities of networks, devices, applications and so on,” says Mr. Gupta. New clients The journey, he says, has been “difficult but steady.” “We have had to consistently innovate both in terms of technology and product placement. One thing that has helped us massively is that we have always worked very closely with our customers.” Unlike most other companies, their customers already know what Seclore’s next product will be like, as the products are designed using inputs from customers, says Mr. Gupta. While their client profile — companies in insurance, financial services, legal, telecom and manufacturing — has stayed the same over the years, government enterprises have now shown interest and invested in their products. Seclore received an investment of $13 million in March this year. Only last week, Indian business group TechnoBind announced a tie-up with Seclore, and said it will offer support to its strategic and business expansion plans in India. Starting out and evolving in Mumbai has given them unique circumstances to grow in, while throwing multiple challenges at them. “Well, Mumbai isn’t the hub for tech talent in the country. It wasn’t much of a problem when we started out, but as we expand and start recruiting in bigger numbers, we realise Mumbai isn’t the ideal place,” says Mr. Tannu. The high cost of living in the city has increased the cost of employing a person for the company, adding to their worries. But being in Mumbai has also allowed them to grow in a certain trajectory and speed. “Mumbai offers a very unique package for a company like ours, and I don’t think any other Indian city offers that. The city has the research institute where our project incubated, it has the financial companies which have been our customers, and also has the sources of investment for our company — you cannot ask for more,” says Mr. Gupta. More challenges When the company went global, it had to make the product quality suitable for demanding international markets. “Maintaining a global presence for a relatively small company which is still in its adolescence is never easy; usually a 230-people-strong company hardly even moves out of one office,” says Mr. Tannu. “But the ultimate vision for the company is to take it from a stage where it was a college project, and make it a market leader in the information and market security space.” With a little under 500 direct customers and over four million direct users of their technology, they say there is enough to keep them going to achieve their target before too long. “Fights over security are more than a thousand years old. It’s just that the weapons have changed, from bows and arrows then to information now.” What keeps them going, he says, is the belief that they are helping the right side. “That is what has made us get up at 4 in the morning, catch a flight to our customers at 5 and work through the day, year after year,” says Mr. Gupta. Future plans Seclore recorded a 83 per cent year-on-year growth in the last financial year but Mr. Gupta says they still have a long way to go. “For now, we want to expand both in terms of employee strength and revenue. By the end of 2017, we plan to have about 350 people in the group, and as always, aim for a 100 per cent year-over-year growth ever year.” To budding entrepreneurs, Mr. Tannu has a word of advice: Have a clear focus on customers and revenue. “Your technology will only be successful if you have paying customers.” More In Technology Mumbai espionage and intelligence Mumbai Related Articles << Previous Story Rati Agnihotri, husband booked for electricity theft Next Story >> Captured forever through a lens Please Wait while comments are loading...

Email Address* Sign Up X Sustainability with sass Design Living Science Technology Transportation Business Energy Slideshows Creating a market for recycled materials in the new plastics economy Tom Szaky, Guest Writer (@TerraCycle) Business / Corporate Responsibility January 19, 2017 Share on Facebook CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 Bo Eide A year ago at the World Economic Forum in Davos, a report from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation found that most plastic packaging is used only once; 95% of the value of plastic packaging material, worth $80 billion-$120 billion annually, is lost to the economy after a short first use. In the design of a “New Plastics Economy,” which challenges institutions to move away from the existing linear, take-make-dispose economy, theoretically, these captured plastics can instead be recycled to be used over and over. Linear solutions for plastic waste miss out on opportunities to capture and use these resources. As it stands from an economic standpoint, the value of capturing plastics for processing is only as high as the profitability of these materials after collection and logistics. Most waste outputs fall outside the scope of recyclability by this rule, and producing new, virgin plastic is currently less costly than purchasing recycled materials on back-end channels. Thus, it is up to manufacturers and brands to create and expand the market for recycled plastics by purchasing recycled materials to make their products, selling them to consumers and then making the product easily recyclable. Procter & Gamble announced that it has teamed up with us at TerraCycle and SUEZ, the largest waste management company in Europe, to source, develop and put out the first fully recyclable shampoo bottle made from up to 25% recycled beach plastic for the world’s #1 shampoo brand, Head & Shoulders. The first 150,000 bottles will be available in France this summer, making it the world’s largest production run of recyclable shampoo bottles made with beach plastic, and a major step in establishing a unique supply chain that supports a new plastics economy. Working directly with NGOs and other beach cleanup organizations, TerraCycle sources the shipments of rigid plastics collected through beach cleanup efforts, capturing these materials for recycling for the first time, at no cost to participants. TerraCycle’s partnership with SUEZ tackles logistics (collection and shipment) and processing (separation and material pelletization) of these mixed plastics so they can be used as recycled raw material. The scale of the beach plastics project focuses on the goal of incorporating more post-consumer recycled content (PCR) across other P&G brands and globally, inspiring other world entities to do the same. P&G has been using PCR plastic in packaging for over 25 years, last year using over 34,000 metric tons, and its Hair Care division is projected to see half a billion bottles per year include 25% post-consumer recycled content (PCR) by the end of 2018. Of the more than 300 million tons of new, virgin plastic produced globally per year, it is estimated that up to 129 million tons (43 percent) of the plastic used is disposed of in landfills; in the United States, the EPA’s most recent report places the plastics recovery rate for recycling at 9 percent. But the benefit of putting forth the resources to divert plastics from landfills and create a market for them in the value system is many-fold. Approximately 10–20 million tons of plastic end up in the oceans each year. These include microplastics, which result in an estimated $13 billion a year in losses from damage to marine ecosystems (not to mention the severe degradation to natural capital suffered by animals and their habitats) and financial losses to fisheries and tourism. If things don’t change, we are projected to see more plastics than fish in the ocean by 2050. Consumer product companies that make the commitment to put out products made from non-virgin raw material create circular systems that can be nurtured for sustainable growth. By rolling out their own sustainability efforts and taking the initiative to foster new infrastructures, manufacturers and brands connect with consumers and drive the shift towards a new plastics economy.

Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States. This marked the best Inauguration Day performance for a president since President Ronald Reagan’s second inauguration in 1985. In the end, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5%, the S&P 500 gained 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite wafted up 0.3% and the Russell 2000 finished the day out with a 0.5% gain. Treasury bonds were mixed, the dollar was weaker, gold gained 0.3% and crude oil rallied rising 2.1%. Materials stocks led the way with a 0.9% gain while healthcare names lagged, down 0.3%. In the semiconductor space, Skyworks Solutions Inc (NASDAQ:SWKS) gained 13% after reporting a quarterly earnings and revenue beat, strong guidance and announcing a new $500 million buyback program. Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) gained 3.3% on solid quarterly results driven by better-than-expected organic sales growth. On the downside, Rite Aid Corporation (NYSE:RAD) fell 13.3% after Bloomberg reported possible antitrust issues with its proposed tie up with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA). And General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) fell 2.2% after reporting weaker-than-expected revenues — boosting the Feb $31 GE puts recommended to Edge Pro subscribers to a gain of nearly 50%. Overall, the day’s gains capped a historic post-election period for the stock market with large-cap stocks up nearly 11% from their pre-election low. That ranks as the best Election Day to Inauguration Day move in the market, edging out the rallies enjoyed in the wake of the elections of Presidents William McKinley and Calvin Coolidge. It also shrugged off a tendency for market weakness on Inauguration Day: According to the folks behind the Traders’ Almanac, stocks tend to fall as new presidents are sworn in two-thirds of the time. Looking ahead, CFRA Research chief investment strategist Sam Stovall notes that starting with President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s inauguration in 1953, the S&P 500 has risen an average of 1.6% the first 100 days of a president’s first term. Trump’s speech largely echoed campaign themes, with economic nationalism and populist feelings prominently featured. Pledges to increase infrastructure, military spending, and border security were all mentioned. And, in this digital era, the peaceful transition of power could be seen from the White House website to Wikipedia. Looking ahead, as the political pomp quiets and traders and investors return to their normal work, the Q4 earnings season will continue to roll on ahead of a Federal Reserve policy meeting at the end of the month. According to FactSet data, analysts are looking for S&P 500 earnings to grow 3.2% from last year — which would mark the first back-to-back expansion in profitability since the beginning of 2015.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 94.85 points, or 0.48 per cent, to 19,827.25. The S&P 500 added 7.62 points, or 0.34 per cent, to 2,271.31. The Nasdaq Composite Index increased 15.25 points, or 0.28 per cent, to 5,555.33, Xinhua news agency reported. US stocks posted solid gains after Trump won the presidency election as investors bet that he would pursue massive corporate tax cuts, deregulation, and infrastructure spending. In corporate news, shares of the Procter & Gamble Co. jumped 3.25 per cent to $87.45 apiece on Friday after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly results. Shares of IBM rose 2.24 per cent to $170.55 per share as the tech giant delivered quarterly results that beat market expectations. Shares of American Express Co. fell 0.64 per cent to $76.20 apiece after the US bank posted quarterly earnings shy of forecasts but revenues above estimates. In a weekly basis, all three major indices witnessed modest losses, with the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq going down 0.3 per cent, 0.1 per cent and 0.3 per cent, respectively. Trump was sworn in on Friday as the 45th President of the United States. In his inauguration address, Trump pledged to put "America first", reigniting some worries of protectionist policies. But he did not touch on specific economic or trade policies. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it's going to be only America first, America first, Trump said. He said the new administration will rebuild infrastructures of the country by following "two simple rules: buy American and hire American". --IANS lok/ SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features In pictures: India's Republic Day Parade 2017 Tamil Nadu fights back on Jallikattu Jallikattu ban: Taming culture?

The S&P 500 added 0.34 percent, with telecommunications leading advancers. The Nasdaq advanced 0.28 percent. "We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs," Trump said after being sworn in. "Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never ever let you down."  "It was a very populist speech. He spoke to the Heartland; he spoke to those who voted for him," said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. "Clearly, it was not what a lot of people were expecting. It was vintage Trump.  "He didn't decide to go high. He decided to go populist and protectionist, and that's something we're going to have to get used to. When you put together populism and protectionism, it has a lot of economic fallout. That's how he got here," said aid Art Hogan, a chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. "We were going higher on the hopes of thing that take time to happen in Washington." The broader stock market has rallied significantly since Trump's electoral victory on the hopes of more government spending, lower corporate taxes and deregulation of some sectors. Stocks, however, have traded mostly sideways for the past month as investors look for more details about Trump's proposed policies. The Trump administration will have to start delivering on these expectations for stocks to remain at current levels, said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets. "Traders are no longer going to monitor his words closely, but the actual actions. The bigger question is if he can get the Congress to wear the same hat," he said. Equities had pulled back slightly leading up to the inauguration, with the benchmark indexes all tracking for weekly losses heading into Friday's session. "What I've noticed over the past couple of days is we've seen a lot of activity in put options," said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. "What this tells me is people are preparing for a pullback, which may not happen." "We saw something similar happen ahead of the election," Frederick said. "The first 100 days are going to be critical. We've got pretty high expectations for GDP and, if they are met, there is room for valuation expansion." Expectations for a stronger economy have not only been bolstered by policy hopes from the new administration, but also by the slew of better-than-expected economic data. Weekly jobless claims remain around their lowest levels in decades, while the consumer price index rose 2.1 percent in December on a year-over-year basis. In fact, the Citi U.S. Economic Surprise index has risen to its highest level since 2014. A higher reading on the index indicates more positive economic data surprises. Jeff Zipper, managing director of investments at the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank, said the economic backdrop is bullish for stocks. He added, however, "the market is definitely looking for some clarity" on Trump's policy plans. There are no major economic data due Friday. Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker said in a speech the U.S. labor participation rate is lower than he would like, and is holding down productivity and growth. In corporate news, earnings season continued as Dow components General Electric and Procter & Gamble both reported quarterly results. GE posted in-line adjusted earnings per share while revenue came slightly below estimates. P&G's results topped estimates on both the top and bottom lines. U.S. Treasury yields gave back some gains Friday after Trump's speech, with the benchmark 10-year note yield trading around 2.489 percent and the two-year note yield near 1.19 percent. "The truth is we don't know where this is going," said John Bredemus, the vice president for Allianz Investment Management. "Uncertainty is not just on the Trump administration, it's also on monetary policy as the Fed steps back." Overseas, European equities traded mostly flat ahead of the inauguration, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index falling just 0.07 percent. In Asia, stocks closed mixed, as the Korean Kospi fell 0.35 percent, while the Shanghai composite advanced 0.7 percent. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded near 12.3.

Home Market Crompton Greaves rated ‘Outperform’ by Credit Suisse; says poised to tap opportunities Crompton Greaves rated ‘Outperform’ by Credit Suisse; says poised to tap opportunities Crompton has a strong franchise in consumer electricals with leading positions in fans and pumps, and a top-three position in lighting. Despite underinvesting for many years prior to demerger in 2015, the company grew market share in a very competitive segment like fans. By: Credit Suisse | Published: January 21, 2017 2:52 AM Crompton has a strong franchise in consumer electricals with leading positions in fans and pumps, and a top-three position in lighting. Despite underinvesting for many years prior to demerger in 2015, the company grew market share in a very competitive segment like fans. The new management now at the helm post takeover by private equity players has long experience in consumer companies like P&G, Philips, Racold and Pidilite. They have initiated a series of interventions which should give results over FY18-19. We see potential low hanging revenue and margin opportunities. Premium fans, agri pumps and LED to drive growth, distribution also a key driver Crompton’s big growth opportunity is in the white spaces within its existing categories which are premium fans and agricultural pumps. LED lighting is another growth area for the company. Distribution is also a big lever for the business, as the company transitions into an FMCG-like consumer offtake oriented distribution. This transition will take two years and should greatly enhance its distribution reach and quality. Margins will gradually move up over 2-3 years There is potential for gradual margin expansion from increasing salience of premium products, operating leverage and cost savings at the back end. There will be a hit to reported Ebitda margins over FY17-19 due to ESOP expenses, which are one time in nature, and not an ongoing expense. Crompton has the highest FCF yield and ROE among our discretionary universe We expect 23% earnings CAGR over FY17-19. Crompton trades at 31x FY18 adjusted earnings, which is the lowest among discretionary stocks while it has the highest return ratios within the sector. We expect growth to be impacted for the next two to three quarters from demonetisation. However, the stock correction by 10% since the event has priced in this slowdown. We initiate with an Outperform rating and a target price of R190. The key risk to our call is a prolonged slowdown in demand as a result of demonetisation. Strong franchise with many long-hanging fruit CGCEL is a leading player in electrical products, spanning segments like fans, pumps, lights and small appliances. We see a lot of potential for expansion in the product range and distribution. Historically strong franchise now getting requisite invesmtents: Crompton has a strong franchise in consumer electricals with market leading positions in fans (27% share) and residential pumps (27% share). There is a new professional leadership in place which has long experience in consumer companies. Management has started a series of interventions which should deliver results over FY18-19. Gradual margin expansion likely: We expect gradual Ebitda margin expansion over the next 2-3 years. The key drivers for this will be increasing salience of premium products within fans, operating leverage from mid-teens revenue growth and cost savings at the back end. Part of the gains will be offset by rising commodity costs in FY18.   Please Wait while comments are loading...

Keris Alison Lahiff Jan 20, 2017 11:56 AM EST U.S. stocks rebounded from a shaky week as Washington leaders assembled at the Capitol for Donald Trump's inauguration on Friday. Markets have wavered in recent days on uncertainty over the changes a Trump administration could bring. Procter & Gamble (PG) rose following better-than-expected quarterly profit and a smaller decline in sales. However, the company did warn that currency exchange woes could cut its full-year sales growth by two to three percentage points. American Express  (AXP) reported a mixed fourth quarter, and fell short on earnings but beat revenue estimates. Net revenue, excluding currency exchange, rose 6% as cardmember spending increased.  Domino's Pizza  (DPZ) was upgraded to overweight from sector weight at KeyBanc. Analysts expressed optimism over growth at the pizza chain, thanks to investments in digital ordering.

The strength on the day comes on the heels of the moderate weakness that was seen in the previous session. Currently, the major averages are hovering firmly in positive territory. The Dow is up 98.83 points or 0.5 percent at 19,831.23, the Nasdaq is up 22.39 points or 0.4 percent at 5,562.47 and the S&P 500 is up 10.08 points or 0.5 percent at 2,273.77. The strength on Wall Street comes as traders have picked up some stocks at relatively reduced levels, with the Dow rebounding after moving lower for five straight sessions and hitting its lowest closing level in over a month. Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (PG) has helped to lead the Dow back to the upside, jumping by 3.7 percent after reporting better than expected second quarter results and raising its forecast for organic sales growth for the full year. IBM (IBM) is also posting a strong gain after the tech giant reported fourth quarter results that exceeded estimates, while General Electric (GE) has come under pressure after reporting weaker than expected fourth quarter revenues. Traders are also keeping an eye on the activity in Washington, D.C., where President-elect Donald Trump is set to be officially sworn in as the nation's 45th president. Trump's inaugural address is expected to be relatively light on policy details, although the tone of his remarks could impact the markets. The incoming president has also suggested he will take immediate action after delivering his speech, telling supporters Thursday he will be signing some "very meaningful" documents to "get the show going." Sector News Oil service stocks are seeing considerable strength in mid-day trading, resulting in a 1.8 percent jump by the Philadelphia Oil Service Index. The gains by oil service stocks come amid a sharp increase by the price of crude oil, with crude for February delivery surging up $1.25 to $52.62 a barrel. Considerable strength is also visible among semiconductor stocks, as reflected by the 1.6 percent gain being posted by the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. With the gain, the index has reached its best intraday level in almost a month. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) is posting a standout gain after the wireless handset chip supplier reported better than expected first quarter results and provided upbeat guidance. The company also announced a $500 million stock buyback. Telecom, airline, and electronic storage stocks are also seeing notable strength on the day, moving higher along with most of the other major sectors. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Friday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index rose by 0.3 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped by 0.7 percent. The major European markets also ended the day mixed. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index edged down by 0.1 percent, the French CAC 40 Index and the German DAX Index rose by 0.2 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively. In the bond, treasuries are extending the notable pullback seen over the course of the two previous sessions. Subsequently, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is up by 3.7 basis points at 2.496 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com The World's 10 Most Productive Nations, Ranked Biotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In February In Memorium: Business Giants We Lost In 2016 More Commentary -Global Stocks Close Roughly Flat For Second Straight Day - U.S. Commentary Stocks Continue To Lack Direction In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary European Markets Finish Mostly Lower On Bank Weakness Stocks Continue To Experience Choppy Trading - U.S. Commentary Stocks May Turn In Another Lackluster Performance - U.S. Commentary Wall Street May Open Broadly Higher Sensex, Nifty Extend Gains For Fourth Day European Shares Drift Lower Amid Mixed Earnings Reports Asian Shares Mostly Higher In Thin Holiday Trade European Stocks Set To Open Mixed Amid Lack Of Triggers Sensex Up 170 Points In Early Trade; Nifty At 8649 Asian Markets Mostly Higher Sensex, Nifty Seen Lower On Mixed Global Cues Thai Market Likely To See Resistance At 1600 Little Movement Expected For Indonesia Shares <<Previous        64 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed McDonald's Sells All Of Its Nordic Restaurants Tim Hortons Coming To Mexico Chevron Turns To Profit In Q4, But Results Miss Estimates Air Products Sees Q2, FY17 Adj.

But in recent sessions, the rally since Election Day cooled off. (CNBC) Heading into Friday's trading, the Dow was on a five-session losing streak, with both the Dow and S&P 500 looking at two straight weeks of losses. The Nasdaq was on track for its first weekly decline in three. (CNBC) Matthew J. Belvedere | Peter Schacknow Friday, 20 Jan 2017 | 8:23 AM ETCNBC.com SHARES Trump is preparing to sign executive actions on his first day in the White House today, taking opening steps to crack down on immigration, build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border and roll back Obama policies. (Reuters) Sometime before he's sworn in, Trump will sit down with the top military officers to get a briefing that provides him with an understanding — and the tools — for how he would wage nuclear war. (NBC News) Warren Buffett, who had supported Hillary Clinton, told CNBC on the eve of Donald Trump's inauguration, the United States will "work fine" under the new administration because American has the "secret sauce." Billionaire John Paulson, who supported Trump's candidacy and helped shape his economic agenda, increased his hedge fund's long exposure to stocks after Election Day. (CNBC) The U.S. is facing a period of dollar strengthening, fueling likely tensions between the new administration and the Fed, BlackRock (BLK) chief Larry Fink told a panel in Davos today. (Reuters) George Soros, in a Bloomberg interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, said he thinks Trump will fail because the ideas that guide him are "inherently self-contradictory." Soros also called Trump a "would-be dictator." Tech entrepreneur and Facebook board member Peter Thiel, a Trump supporter, could soon become the next U.S. ambassador to Germany, according to the New York Post. David Nason, a GE executive and a Treasury official in 2008, is a front runner to become the Fed's Wall Street regulator under Trump. Nason was a deputy to former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. (Reuters) Investors are focusing on earnings from four Dow components, beginning with General Electric (GE), which this morning matched estimates with quarterly profit but missed on revenue. (CNBC) Procter & Gamble (PG) this morning reported earnings and revenue that beat expectations. The consumer products giant also increased its full- year 2017 guidance on organic sales growth. (CNBC) American Express (AXP) late Thursday missed on earnings but exceed estimates with revenue. The financial services firm raised its 2017 earnings outlook, but the CEO said the market environment continues to be "very challenging." (CNBC) IBM (IBM), after the bell Thursday, beat expectations on earnings and revenue, while reporting a 33 percent increase in its cloud business. But sales dropped for the 19th consecutive quarter. (CNBC) Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google unit is pushing its own products to top spots in search results, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal. Those products include everything from Pixel phones to Nest smart thermostats. An investigation into the faulty batteries that led Samsung to pull the Galaxy Note 7 found some of them were irregularly sized, causing overheating, while others had manufacturing problems. (WSJ) Mexican drug kingpin Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman has been extradited to the U.S., a little more than a year after he was caught following a brazen escape from a maximum-security prison. (NBC News) Eight people have been found alive under the avalanche that buried an Italian mountain hotel almost two days ago and rescuers are working to free them from the snow. (Reuters) BY THE NUMBERS For the second time in two days, Fed Chair Janet Yellen last night warned about the risks letting the economy run too hot, advocating gradual interest rate hikes. In December, the Fed signalled three hikes for 2017. Two more Fed officials are scheduled to speak today, including Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker at 9 a.m. ET this morning and San Francisco Fed President John Williams 10 p.m. ET tonight. Baker Hughes releases at 1 p.m. ET its weekly rig count. Meanwhile, oil prices were higher this morning for the second day on hopes a weekend meeting of producers demonstrate compliance to a global output cut deal. STOCKS TO WATCH JPMorgan (JPM) chief Jamie Dimon saw a 3.7 percent rise in compensation in 2016, according to an SEC filing. Dimon received a $1.5 million salary and incentive-based compensation of $26.5 million, paid in both cash and stock. Wells Fargo (WFC) is merging its international business with its wholesale banking operation. The head of international was named chief operating officer for the newly constituted wholesale banking unit. Target (TGT) promoted executive Rick Gomez to chief marketing officer, a position that had been vacant since August when Jeff Jones left to take a job at raid-hailing service Uber. Matthew J.

The major index futures are currently pointing to a modestly higher open for the markets, with the Dow futures up by 22 points. Traders may look to pick up stocks at somewhat reduced levels on the heels of some recent weakness, as the Dow has closed for five straight sessions. Early trading activity is likely to be somewhat subdued, however, as traders await incoming President Donald Trump's inaugural address. Trump's speech is expected to be relatively light on policy details, although the tone of his remarks could impact the markets. Traders are likely to keep an eye on any immediate actions taken by Trump after he is officially sworn in as the nation's 45th president. Amid a quiet day on the economic front, trading may also be impacted by reaction to that latest batch of earnings news from big name companies. After the close of trading on Thursday, tech giant IBM (IBM) reported fourth quarter earnings and revenues that exceeded analyst estimates, although its revenues fell for the 19th straight quarter. American Express (AXP) reported fourth quarter earnings that came in below expectations despite better than expected revenues. The credit card giant also raised its 2017 earnings guidance. Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (PG) reported second quarter results that exceeded analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines and raised its forecast for organic sales growth for the full year. General Electric's (GE) fourth quarter adjusted earnings matched expectations, although its revenues for the quarter came in below estimates. The company reaffirmed its guidance for 2017. After initially showing a lack of direction, stocks moved moderately lower over the course of the trading session on Thursday. The Dow closed lower for the fifth consecutive session, falling to its lowest closing level in over a month. The major averages closed in negative territory but off their worst levels of the day. The Dow fell 72.32 points or 0.4 percent to 19,732.40, the Nasdaq dipped 15.57 points or 0.3 percent to 5,540.08 and the S&P 500 slid 8.20 points or 0.4 percent to 2,263.69. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Friday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index rose by 0.3 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped by 0.7 percent. The major European markets have also turned mixed on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index has edged down by 0.1 percent, the German DAX Index is up by 0.1 percent and the French CAC 40 Index is up by 0.2 percent. In commodities trading, crude oil futures are climbing $0.78 to $52.15 a barrel after rising $0.29 to $51.37 a barrel on Thursday. Gold futures are currently trading at $1,202.30 an ounce, up $0.80 from the previous session's close of $1,201.50 an ounce. On Thursday, gold fell $10.60. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 114.99 yen compared to the 114.86 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Thursday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.0645 compared to yesterday's $1.0664. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com The World's 10 Most Productive Nations, Ranked Biotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In February In Memorium: Business Giants We Lost In 2016 More Commentary -Global Stocks Close Roughly Flat For Second Straight Day - U.S. Commentary Stocks Continue To Lack Direction In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary European Markets Finish Mostly Lower On Bank Weakness Stocks Continue To Experience Choppy Trading - U.S. Commentary Stocks May Turn In Another Lackluster Performance - U.S. Commentary Wall Street May Open Broadly Higher Sensex, Nifty Extend Gains For Fourth Day European Shares Drift Lower Amid Mixed Earnings Reports Asian Shares Mostly Higher In Thin Holiday Trade European Stocks Set To Open Mixed Amid Lack Of Triggers Sensex Up 170 Points In Early Trade; Nifty At 8649 Asian Markets Mostly Higher Sensex, Nifty Seen Lower On Mixed Global Cues Thai Market Likely To See Resistance At 1600 Little Movement Expected For Indonesia Shares <<Previous        64 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed McDonald's Sells All Of Its Nordic Restaurants Tim Hortons Coming To Mexico Chevron Turns To Profit In Q4, But Results Miss Estimates Air Products Sees Q2, FY17 Adj.

It still expects the treatment – a combination of its immunotherapy drugs Opdivo and Yervoy – to be approved in the second half of 2018. General Electric — GE matched estimates with adjusted fourth-quarter profit of 46 cents per share, but revenue came in below Street forecasts as the energy business remained under pressure. Procter & Gamble — The consumer products giant earned $1.08 per share for its latest quarter, beating estimates by 2 cents a share. Revenue came in above estimates, as well. The company also increased its full-year 2017 organic sales growth guidance. IBM — IBM reported adjusted quarterly profit of $5.01 per share, 13 cents a share above estimates. Revenue was slightly above Street forecasts, but fell for the 19th consecutive quarter. IBM did report a 33 percent increase in its cloud business, as it continues its transition away from its older businesses. American Express — American Express missed estimates by 7 cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of 91 cents per share. Revenue came in above forecasts and the financial services company raised its 2017 earnings outlook. CEO Kenneth Chenault said the market environment continues to be "very challenging," but that the company's growth initiatives are making progress. Domino's Pizza — The stock was upgraded to "overweight" from "sector weight" at KeyBanc, on optimism about sustainable growth for the pizza chain. KeyBanc is particularly optimistic about the company's strong move into digital ordering. Wells Fargo — Wells Fargo is merging its international business with its wholesale banking operation. International head Richard Yorke was named chief operating officer for the newly constituted wholesale banking unit. Las Vegas Sands — Las Vegas Sands will pay nearly $7 million to end a five-year investigation into alleged corrupt practices. The probe had centered on the casino operator's relationship with a consultant operating in Macau and in China. Las Vegas Sands was not charged with a crime and the settlement does not contain any admission of guilt. Alphabet — Alphabet's Google unit is pushing its own products to top spots in search results, according to a Wall Street Journal study. Those products include everything from Pixel phones to Nest smart thermostats. Separately, Pacific Crest is rating both Alphabet and Facebook "overweight" in resumed coverage, based in large part on increased ad pricing. JPMorgan Chase — Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon received a 3.7 percent raise in compensation for 2016, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Dimon received a salary of $1.5 million and incentive-based compensation of $26.5 million, paid in both cash and stock. Target — The retailer promoted executive Rick Gomez to chief marketing officer, a position that had been vacant since August, when Jeff Jones left to take a job at Uber. Regions Financial — The regional bank matched estimates with profit of 23 cents per share, with revenue also essentially in line. Regions did see an increase in net interest margin, a measure of lending profitability. SunTrust Banks — SunTrust came in 2 cents a share above estimates, with quarterly profit of 90 cents per share. Revenue was in line with forecasts. SunTrust did see a drop in profit over a year earlier, thanks in part to higher expenses. Schlumberger — The oilfield services giant matched Street forecasts with adjusted quarterly profit of 27 cents per share, while revenue beat estimates. Schlumberger saw strength in the Middle East and North America, but performance was weaker in Latin America. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story gave an inaccurate year-over-year earnings comparison for General Electric.

While the world at large may have been shocked by his confrontation attitude, sneered at his apparent lack of sophistication, dismissed his aggression and criticized obvious conflicts of interest, global markets still have to ask themselves whether in fact he is their corporate saviour? Were the UK's Brexit vote and Trump's US victory actually flashing red lights as to prospective disintegration within the fabric of western society? Was the President-elect the only one smart enough to understand that a US crisis, possibly more obviously moral than economic, as deep as the great depression that faced Roosevelt back in the late 1920s is looming and, more to the point, that he is the only one with the courage to fix it? Time will tell but, of course, getting his revolutionary agenda - which includes the creation of 25m new jobs, more than halving corporation and personal taxes, applying swinging border and import controls, while throwing out the bulk of Federal regulation - through is now the giant challenge. Whether he eventually achieves this through a mixture of threats, coercion, bribery and possibly even charm, or finds himself so bamboozled by Congress that he simply walks off in a huff halfway through his first term in office, for sure Donald Trump is already assured that he will be more than just a footnote in American history. Contemplating all this last night, the principle US indices all struggled to make headway ending slightly down, with some considering the markets had become rather overbought in their push to see the Dow Jones break through the 20,000 marker. Traders gleaned little new from either of Janet Yellen or Theresa May's speeches yesterday, although US Treasuries still suffered their biggest sell-off in four weeks as investors became increasingly resolved to the idea of the Fed kicking off its round of rate hikes sooner rather than later. Asia ended mixed, with the Shanghai Composite making a reasonable gain on news that Chinese economic growth for 2016 came out at 6.7%, comfortably within Beijing's target range and providing relief given evidence of slow industrial activity during the fourth quarter; the Hang Seng and ASX just followed the US market lead into modest losses. Today, the UK Prime Minister is scheduled to meet with senior executives from Wall Street, while London is also due to publish December Retail Sales data along with earnings or trading updates from a few UK second-liners like Bonmarche (BON.L), Brainjuicer (BJU.L) and Midatech Pharma (MTPH.L) and, later this afternoon, a few US majors including General Electric and Procter & Gamble are expected to publish their quarterlies. In reality, however, all this will fade into the background with the new President takes to the microphone afternoon. Awaiting this, London is seen opening in a quiet, contemplative mood with the FTSE-100 seen 5 points either side of unchanged in early trading." - Barry Gibb, Research Analyst   Markets Europe The FTSE-100 finished yesterday's session 0.54% lower at 7,208.44, whilst the FTSE AIM All-Share index closed 0.09% down at 872.31. In continental Europe, the CAC-40 finished 0.25% lower at 4,841.14 whilst the DAX was 0.02% lower at 11,596.89. Wall Street In New York last night, the Dow Jones slid 0.37% to 19,732.4, the S&P-500 dropped 0.36% to 2,263.69 and the Nasdaq eased 0.28% to finish the session at 5,540.08. Asia In Asian markets this morning, the Nikkei 225 had gained 0.53% to 19,173.51 and the Hang Seng lost 0.57% to 22,918.42. Oil In early trade today, WTI crude was up 0.31% to $51.53/bbl and Brent was ahead 0.44% to $54.40/bbl.   Headlines China's economy grows 6.7% in 2016 China's economy grew by 6.7% in 2016, compared with 6.9% a year earlier, according to official data, marking its slowest growth since 1990. The figure is in line with Beijing's growth target of between 6.5% and 7%. But the news comes just a couple of days after the leader of one Chinese region admitted GDP data was faked. China is a key driver of the global economy and a growth slowdown is a major concern for investors around the world. Source: BBC News   Company news CyanConnode Holdings (LON:CYAN, 0.20p) – Speculative Buy CyanConnode, the world leader in narrowband radio mesh networks yesterday released a trading update for the 12 months ended 31 December 2016. Management confirmed trading for the period had remained in line with its expectations, with revenues of approximately £1.8 million, which is an increase of 560% compared to the same period last year. Cash, as of 31 December 2016, was £3.9 million. It went on to note that a significant portion of revenue growth was underpinned by the PVVNL and CESC deployments in India and that the long-term nature of subsequent contract wins provides improved visibility going forward, with order backlog from existing contracts in multiple regions going into 2017. The Board also went on to underscore its confidence following the acquisition of Connode, declaring it to be transformational to the business plan by significantly expanding the Group's geographic reach while enhancing the product suite with a full standards-based (IPv6/6LoWPAN) technology platform. It considers the enlarged Group is now well-placed to build its presence in new markets and to cross sell to existing customers. There was also positive news on the contracts front: 2016's key win was the £10 million purchase order for smart metering from Micromodje in Iran, which is expected to move into the delivery phase during 2017. In November 2016, the UK Data Communications Company also announced the official go-live of the UK smart metering project with the data centre now active for communication between consumers and the utilities with rollout due to commence this year. Having successfully delivered all 2016 project milestones for the UK smart metering contract, CyanConnode software license and support fees revenue is expected to be £25 million over the life of the contract. Furthermore, it continued to strengthen relationships in India, highlighted by the third smart metering order with Larsen & Toubro; this order for 4,700 additional smart meters is part of a larger framework agreement between Tata Power Mumbai and L&T, and follows previous orders of 10,000 consumer meters in Mumbai. Management understands that the Indian Ministry of Power remains committed to installing a majority of the planned 35 million smart meters by 2019 and are pushing the local smart metering suppliers to accelerate their readiness for volume deployments. The Board is also encouraged by the Group's entry into the market in Thailand, where the local distribution partner has now invested £4 million into CyanConnode equity, based on both the Thai and global opportunities. Our view: A genuinely global business with market leading technology on the cusp of a dramatic expansion. Smart metering, which provides unique solutions to problems faced by energy suppliers in both the developing and developed world, is just commencing its long-term installation phase. As with all new technologies, first mover advantage, together with a cost-effective but comprehensive solution, is key to capturing and retaining the opportunity. This is exactly what CyanConnode is now providing, as evidenced by its participation in the world's largest and most sophisticated projects, such as the UK's smart metering project and the National Smart Metering Program of Iran. Having established the scale of the opportunity (see Beaufort's publication 'The Future is Smart!' that was released on 21 September 2016), the coming 24 months will see CyanConnode's branded offering occupy the position of 'industry standard' for the sector. This will enable it to add significantly to the already impressive backlog from India, Iran and the UK both with repeat orders and new large, long-term and exceptionally sticky customers. Despite using a chunk of the £12.6m (gross) raised through last summer's Placing and Subscription to acquire Connode and build up working capital, it still holds a significant cash reserve as it heads into 2017. CyanCannode's business model is maturing while its business opportunity remains in its infancy. Recognising the Group's lead in this giant developing opportunity, Beaufort reiterates its Speculative Buy recommendation and price target of 0.6p/share. Beaufort Securities acts as corporate broker to CyanConnode Holdings plc   Finsbury Food Group (LON:FIF, 109.50p) – Buy Finsbury Food Group ('Finsbury Food'), the UK speciality bakery manufacturer of cake, bread and morning goods for the retail and foodservice channels, yesterday provided a pre-close trading update for the half year ended 31 December 2016 ('H1 FY2017'). The Group said Christmas trading was "solid" and H1 performance is in line with management's expectations. During the period, revenues remained flat at £156.6m; comprised of -2.9% fall in the UK Bakery division and +31.7% growth in the overseas division (Group's 50% owned European business), against the comparable period (H1 FY2016). The Group have invested £5m in capital projects during H1. As noted before, the Board reiterated that the scale of the current cost inflation is such that despite such internal initiatives (e.g. investment in product innovation and continue to improve efficiency and productivity), further cost recovery will be required and will become inflationary in the second half and beyond. Our view: Finsbury Food delivered a resilient result for H1 FY2017 against what was an exceptionally strong comparative. Although revenues remained flat at £156.6m, that was against H1 FY2016 which saw +46% growth year-on-year. The flat outcome resulted from a -2.9% fall in the UK Bakery division (FY2016: 88% of revenue), slightly eased from -4.0% seen for the first 4 months, which was then offset by strong growth in its oversea division (FY2016: 12% of revenue) of +31.7%. The growth for oversea division has further accelerated from that seen last year, at +18.8% (or +36.5% for the first 4 months of FY2017). As with last trading update, no LFL sales performance was provided. The market, however, appeared more cautious about persistent cost pressure faced by the Group as a result of weaker Sterling-led commodity price inflation (input costs are globally priced in dollars or euros) and the planned National Living Wage increases, which means the Group will have to do more to protect against margin erosion. We believe consumer staples tend, in any case, to be generally resilient, while the growing overseas division will benefit from translations of weaker Sterling. The consumer confidence in the UK also remain relatively firm, witnessed from recent strong UK major supermarket sales growth. At a forward 11.5x P/E multiple, 6.4x EV/EBITDA together with a 2.6% dividend yield for the current year, the shares remain cheap for such a quality business. Yesterday's share price overreaction created more buying opportunities. Beaufort repeats its Buy recommendation with a price target of 140p per share.   Royal Mail (LON:RMG, 422.50p) – Hold Royal Mail, the UK's designated universal postal service provider, yesterday provided a trading update for the 9 months ended 25 December 2016. During the period, Group revenue remained flat, due to -2% fall in UKPIL (UK Parcels, International & Letters, 83% of revenue in FY2016), offset by +9% growth in GLS (General Logistics Systems, 17% of revenue in FY2016). For UKPIL, parcels revenue increased by +3%, supported by +3% growth in volumes, while letter revenue declined by -5% due to -6% fall in addressed letter volumes. GLS saw volume growth of +8%, benefitted from the timing of Easter and other public holidays across Europe. Looking ahead, the Group said its cost avoidance programme remains on track to deliver c.£225m of UKPIL operating costs in FY2017, while it continues to target a reduction of up to -1% in underlying UKPIL operating costs before transformation costs. The Group confirmed that total net cash investment will be no more than £500m this year and next. Royal Mail's CEO, Moya Greene commented "Our postmen and women delivered a great service at Christmas, even better than last year, with 138m parcels handled in December alone. Our comprehensive planning, which started much earlier this year, enabled us to deliver this service for our customers right across the UK." The Group will announce its full year result ending 26 March 2017 on 18 May 2017. Our view: Royal Mail's result remain disappointing, continue to be affected by the challenging market conditions. Addressed letter volumes, particularly advertising and business letters, continue to decline in the UK, while competition surrounding its parcels business remains intense. UK letters and parcels volume tends to be correlated with movements in GDP, and therefore to the general health of the UK economy. While this is true, we also believe the volume of addressed letters are unlikely to improve as consumers fundamentally and irrevocably switch to electronic communications, deserting in the process traditional paper delivery. Companies are likely to increasingly adopt electronic direct mailing for advertising as well, which will be cheaper, delivered immediately while having the capability to observe statistical data/behaviour of the receivers. With a 4-6% decline per annum of addressed letter volumes expected by the management, GLS is now the only driver of revenue growth for Royal Mail. The Group's entry into premium B2C business and the recent partnership with a Chinese e-Commerce company is an interesting move to capture the growth, but the parcels market itself remains highly competitive as Amazon Logistics and a myriad of other me-too players compete for market share. With a difficult UK economic outlook complicated with pension affordability, wage inflation and Union issues to confront, we consider the Group's current FY2017E and FY2018E P/E multiples of 10.9x and 10.7x, with dividend yield of 5.4% and 5.6%, respectively, fairly values the shares. Beaufort reiterate its Hold rating on Royal Mail.

Close share panel Image copyright Levi Image caption Chip Bergh usually does between 12 and 14 hours of sport a week Ask Levi boss Chip Bergh how he's finding his first trip to the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, and his immediate response is to say how frustrated he is by the lack of time to exercise. The sports-obsessed chief executive - who competes in triathlons and is a vegan - normally exercises daily from 5.30am to 7am doing a mixture of swimming, running and weights. In total, he does between 12 and 14 hours of sport a week. "No-one is as intense as me," he quips. The vegan trying to make the perfect burger Does living to 100 mean we'll work forever? The successful women embracing ‘girl power’ Davos coverage in full Yet, in the testosterone-fuelled world of alpha males (and it is normally males) who make up the top ranks of the corporate world, exercise is often pretty high on the agenda. And it makes sense - the kind of drive, discipline and determination needed to push yourself to work out and compete - are exactly the same skills needed to get to the top. Media captionLevi boss shares his jeans story Mr Bergh, who was headhunted to lead the 163-year-old jeans firm after almost three decades at consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble, credits his exercise regime with helping him succeed in the new role. When he took the helm, Levi was losing out to cheaper and more fashionable rivals, with sales half of their annual $7bn peak. He changed all but one of the 11-strong executive team, and two thirds of its next tier of management alongside making significant cuts, including outsourcing its IT, finance and customer services. Performance Sales and profit have now grown for the past four years. Exercise, he says, gave him the strength to make such dramatic changes. "I really do firmly believe it plays a part in performance. For me personally when I'm healthy and exercising, eating right and getting enough rest, I'm much more productive at work," he says. His conviction of the benefits of exercise meant that when he joined he set up a "Live wellth" programme at the firm, including a cheap gym membership deal for staff and a nutritional onsite cafe at its San Francisco headquarters. For any company, encouraging staff to take care of their health makes sense, he says, due to the risk of high healthcare costs if they don't. "It's not just the performance side of this, but the potential avoidance of costs," he says. Image copyright (c)Marco Onofri Image caption Nerio Alessandri, chief executive of Technogym, thinks companies should offer their staff fitness facilities It's an issue companies are increasingly cottoning on to, says Nerio Alessandri, the founder and chief executive of Italian fitness equipment manufacturer Technogym. In fact, he says providing machines, fitness programmes and apps to companies is now its fastest growing market. Increasingly, he thinks the so-called millennial generation - those born between 1980 and 1999, and a group that accountancy firm Deloitte predicts will make up 75% of the global workforce by 2022 - will expect their workplaces to offer fitness facilities. "It's a key way to attract talent. They don't want the car, or the other perks," he says. Keep moving We're talking - whilst sitting on big bouncy balls - in the firm's pop-up store in Davos, while impossibly honed and fit-looking company representatives run and cycle furiously on stationary machines beside us. Image caption The World Economic Forum is littered with posters encouraging people to walk Mr Alessandri himself works out every morning for an hour at 6.30am, and cycles and runs at the weekend, but crucially, he says, whilst wobbling frenetically on the ball, he never stops moving. "Exercise is one of the rules of the champion chief executive. If you're not healthy, you don't have a healthy mind, you don't have creativity, you don't have energy and productivity goes down," he says. At Technogym's head office in Cesena in northern Italy, taking the lift is banned unless someone has a physical issue. There are no chairs, just balls for seats and all meetings take place at high tables to force them to stand up. But what if a staff member isn't into fitness? "It's an opportunity. We make them," he jokes. Image copyright Nerio Alessandri Image caption Armani was not impressed by Nerio Alessandri's attempt at fashion design In fact, he says his personal mission is to try to address the sedentary lifestyle that has been linked to health problems. "People were born to move for 30km a day. Today, it's less than 1km a day. We're committed to covering the gap," he says. Mr Alessandri, who originally wanted to be a fashion designer but turned to fitness equipment after a rejection from Armani, believes the secret is to make the workout equipment look good. "If it's like a piece of art, not a machine, then you put it on display and you're more likely to use it. If it's ugly, you stick it in the garage and never use it," he says. So far, the regime appears to be working. The firm has supplied the equipment for the past six Olympics and sales hit $581m in 2015, the most recent full-year figures available. "Let's move for a better world is my mantra," he says. It's a mantra shared by the WEF. In Davos, posters are everywhere telling attendees of the benefits to the planet of walking instead of driving. And temporary signs in the village display the number of steps and time taken to reach a particular destination. Image caption Signs are placed across Davos helping delegates to calculate their daily step count Given the almost constant traffic gridlock on the streets in the morning and evening, I'm not sure delegates are heeding the message. But Tupperware chief executive Rick Goings says the WEF's emphasis on health and fitness persuaded him to make changes at his own firm. Its base in Orlando, Florida now boasts a fitness centre as well as biking and walking paths. And Mr Goings himself fits the mould of a typical high achiever - he too is an exercise freak. Image copyright Tupperware Image caption Mr Goings meditates every day "I can still bench press my weight. I never miss a workout and do at least an hour every other day no matter what. Fitness gives me energy," he says. He also meditates every day. "How old do you think I am?" he asks, thrusting his face forward. I guess late 50s. "Seventy-one," he says triumphantly. "And no plastic surgery."

Karen Thuermer Directory 2017 The Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA), signed into law on May 11, 2016 by President Obama, has received wide industry praise from manufacturers including Boeing, Caterpillar, Corning, Eli Lilly and Co., General Electric, Honda, IBM, Intel, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, Siemens, Microsoft, and United Technologies, as well as organizations such as the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the Software & Information Industry Association (SIIA), the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Related Research Partners, Not Handouts: A Winning Model for Manufacturing Innovation First Person: U.S. Economy Uniquely Positioned for 21st Century Participation in the Global Economy Keeps U.S. Economy Growing Matt Lavoie, spokesman for Caterpillar, says, “Caterpillar has publicly supported the act, having sent numerous letters to Congress. We feel it’s important to protect intellectual property for companies like Caterpillar.” And NAM writes, “Trade secrets are vital to the competitiveness of companies throughout our economy, and the threat to these innovations is becoming more serious and more complex. By creating a strong, uniform body of trade secrets law nationwide, the DTSA ensures that our laws keep pace.” Government officials point out that trade secrets are worth $5 trillion to the U.S. economy, and losses can cost between $160 billion and $480 billion a year. Government data further points out that trade secrets comprise as much as 80 percent of the value of a company’s knowledge portfolio. Trade secrets are vital to the competitiveness of companies throughout our economy, and the threat to these innovations is becoming more serious and more complex. By creating a strong, uniform body of trade secrets law nationwide, the DTSA ensures that our laws keep pace. DTSA, which extends the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, essentially gives trade secret owners the option of using federal law to file trade secret lawsuits. Prior to DTSA, only state law authorized these lawsuits. Many see DTSA as critical given the growing rise in trade secret theft from foreign hackers, nation states, and rogue employees interested in obtaining U.S. businesses’ trade secrets. Jule Sigall, assistant general consul of IP Policy and Strategy for Microsoft, points out that prior to DTSA owners of copyrights, patents, and trademarks could go to federal court to protect their property and seek damages when their property was infringed upon, but trade secret owners could not. Importance to Technology Companies Unlike patents, which give a set of exclusive rights to an inventor or assignee for a limited period of time in exchange for detailed public disclosure of an invention, trade secrets are not necessarily technical, but can be anything of commercial value that is not public. Sigall stresses that trade secrets are especially important today for technology companies, big and small. “Consider Microsoft’s Cortana, for example, which is our personal digital assistant,” he writes in a blog. “Behind Cortana sits a vast amount of technology developed or enhanced in-house by Microsoft — voice recognition; language translation; reactive and predictive algorithms that can synthesize context, location and data, and interface with the vast resources of the Bing search engine index; and a complex array of cloud servers to crunch and serve data in real time. This technology represents tens of thousands of hours of research, trial and error, and continued improvement as Cortana is adapted for new devices and new scenarios.” Another important aspect to DTSA is how it impacts hiring practices. Employees cannot be prevented from working for competitors due to their knowledge of trade secrets. Conditions on employment, however, must be tailored to the threatened misappropriation. An example: bakery-café chain Panera sued pizza chain Papa John’s, claiming its former head of IT was using Panera’s trade secrets to facilitate small orders and catering in his new employment with Papa John’s.

In this particular study, external factors (nurture) had a larger effect on exceptionally youthful skin appearance than two identified genetic variations (nature). More specifically, sunscreen usage and positive attitude were positively correlated with younger-looking skin, while sunbathing and frequent dry skin have a negative association with skin aging. The collaboration was inspired by a breakthrough discovery made last year when Olay identified biological commonalities among a group of women called ‘exceptional skin agers’. During the brand’s largest research endeavor, the Multi-Decade and Ethnicities Study (MDE Study), Olay scientists found that 10% of women looked more than 10 years younger than their actual age and shared a unique gene expression fingerprint, effectively enabling their skin to behave like that of someone much younger. This led to questions about why some women look more than 10 years younger than their actual age; due to their environment and lifestyle choices, or a genetic predisposition. Most recently, in a study with over 155,000 participants conducted in collaboration with 23andMe, Olay researchers learned that women can take control to achieve exceptional skin aging. The work will be presented at this year’s AAD Annual Meeting [1] . Women who almost always used sunscreen were 78% more likely to be an exceptional skin ager, compared to women who almost never do. Women who reported they had a positive attitude towards themselves were 30% more likely to be an exceptional skin ager. Similarly, women with less than ideal skincare habits were less likely to achieve successful skin aging. Women who frequently sunbathed were 35% less likely to be an exceptional skin ager. Women who frequently or always suffered from dry skin were 30% less likely to be an exceptional skin ager. Additional positive predictors included: activity and energy levels, living in an urban area, regular exercise, eight or more hours of sleep a night, multi-vitamin usage and high self-rated health. Additional negative predictors included: smoking cigarettes and a body mass index of over 25. “These findings are incredibly exciting because they show that women can actively take beauty into their own hands,” said Dr. Frauke Neuser, Principal Scientist, Olay Skin Care, P&G. “In this study, having skin that looks exceptionally young – ageless – was not down to luck; genetics plays some role, but factors within women's control have larger effects. Future genomics and genetics research might enable us to provide increasingly personalized services and product solutions for women around the world.” Inspired by these insights and the discovery of the 10% exceptional skin agers, Olay re-engineered some of its most loved products with new ingredients to help more women’s skin look ageless. Specifically, several new or reformulated Olay Regenerist, Luminous and Total Effects products, containing Carob Seed Extract, carnosine or increased amounts of antioxidants respectively, have been shown to deliver visible results and youthful looking skin. New Olay Regenerist, Luminous and Total Effects will be available at local retailers beginning January 2017.

If they aren’t careful this year, they may end up smacking potential customers in the face. As Madison Avenue prepares to pitch soda, beer and gadgets to hundreds of millions of viewers expected to watch Fox’s February 5th broadcast of Super Bowl LI, its residents must tread carefully to the goal line. Even though this annual gridiron classic unites Americans like few media properties can in an age of splintering media usage, the viewership is more divided than ever, marketing experts argue, and audiences remain raw and polarized after the recent election of Donald J. Trump to the office of U.S. President. “Cutting through the noise is a difficult task for these advertisers, but they’ve got to be a little more careful in terms of taking a position on one issue, because they will have an equal number of people on the other side,” said Darrin Duber-Smith, who teaches marketing at Metropolitan State University of Denver. “America has not been this divided in modern memory. I think it’s like the rules at the bar: Don’t talk religion and politics.” Could that mean a spate of toned-down commercials come Game Day? Already, GoDaddy, a web-services provider that has run mischievous ads in the past, has said it intends to run a spot talking about the power of the Internet.  Fox sent one advertiser, building-supply company  84 Lumber, back to the drawing board when its proposed commercial was spotted depicting a wall that blocked people – a potential reference to the President-elect’s desire to build a stronger barrier on the U.S. border with Mexico. Anheuser-Busch has indicated that it will do away with celebrities and frat-boy humor in favor of ads that burnish the core qualities of brews like Bud Light and Michelob Ultra. The company did not craft its Super Bowl ads with recent election results in mind, said Marcel Marcondes, vice president of marketing at Anheuser-Busch. But one ad, for flagship beer Budweiser, is expected to tell the tale of co-founder Adolphus Busch, and link his story to a quest for the American Dream. Related Super Bowl Ads: 11 Commercials That Forced The Big Game To Change Its Spots Not everyone is minding the rules. Procter & Gamble’s Mr. Clean, a first-time entrant to Super Bowl advertising, is teasing its appearance online with a short video that tells viewers its famous bald-headed character is about to “get dirty.” Millions of dollars are at stake. Fox is seeking more than $5 million for a 30-second ad berth in this year’s pigskin championship – and typically tries to sell larger packages that would generate even more revenue. Other advertisers on board this year include Kia, Pepsi, Intel, Lexus and Avocados from Mexico. You’d think most Super Bowl marketers would play it safe.  An influx over the years of freshmen advertisers with little national marketing experience, however, raised eyebrows. Last year, 23% of the ad roster for Super Bowl 50  – 10 in all – were first-timers, according to Kantar Media, a tracker of ad spending.  In 2015, 28% of the advertisers put a cleat on the field for the first time. Many of these companies are relative unknowns and eager to make a big splash. To accomplish that feat, they put a good chunk of their annual marketing budget into buying a commercial, then worry less about production values and creative direction.  Last year, Dollar Shave Club ran a spot that looked like it was made for about a dollar, featuring a sassy razor talking to a guy in the shower. Others stumble by running commercials that prove offensive, such as a 2011 spot from Groupon, then a new Super Bowl supporter, that appeared to poke fun at conditions in Tibet. Marketers must communicate with everyone tuned into the game, not just a sub-section of the viewership. said Omer Shai, chief marketing officer of Wix, a digital-services company that is entering its third spin as a Super Bowl advertiser. “Everybody needs to like it,” he said. Getting people to do so will be a tougher task in 2017. Studies of conversations across thousands of digital sites conducted by Amobee, a company that helps advertisers plan and allocate digital pitches, found consumers talking more about America being divided than being unified, according to Jonathan Cohen, the company’s principal brand analyst. “Brands have to recognize the impact his election is having on the national conversation,” he said. Making matters worse, Super Bowl ads in the last few years have lost some of their joy. Many marketers have hitched their ads to causes.  In 2015, advertisers including Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Nissan and the NFL cautioned viewers about everything from online bullying to spousal abuse. Last year, viewers had to watch an ad for a remedy for opioid-induced constipation, a reminder that many Americans are grappling with painkiller addictions. SodaStream, an upstart that sold a make-your-own-soda kit, debuted in 2013 with an ad that pointed out how buying plastic soda bottles hurt the environment. Many Americans find these ads tiresome, suggested Duber Smith: “I’m trying to watch the damn game, and I’m tired of being preached to.” Related Why Super Bowl Ads Could Be Sad, Somber and Serious for Years to Come To score a touchdown, advertisers should try ads that push consumers to look to the horizon, said Michael Goldberg, an ad-industry veteran who is chief executive of Zimmerman Advertising, an ad agency owned by Omnicom Group. “Someone has to go, ‘Enough,’” he said. “That’s going to be the social currency this year – aligning a brand with not just general unification, but addressing the issue and trying to cap it.” Chrysler has had success with this technique in the past. As the nation tried to drag itself out of a massive recession late last decade, the automaker ran dynamic two-minute spots that urged viewers to help the country get back on its feet. A 2012 ad featured rapper Eminem driving a Chrysler 200 through Detroit. The ad was meant to show the Motor City and the auto industry in revival mode after tough times. The following year, Chrysler ran an even more memorable spot featuring actor Clint Eastwood telling viewers that it was “halftime in America,” and that the moment had come to push ahead. The tradition stretches back even farther. After the terrorist attacks of 9/11, Anheuser-Busch used a 2002 Super Bowl commercial to show its stately Clydesdales paying tribute to New York City. In 2017, knitting the American public back together might require more than even those famous horses.

{{'Shortcuts' | translate}} Eng Esp [OP-ED]: Why tax reform will be a slog Language English Tax “reform,” starting with taxes on business, seems to be on everyone’s agenda, and it may be a place where the incoming Trump administration and its Democratic critics find common ground. But it’s still going to be a slog, and one reason is so-called “pass-through” businesses whose taxes are levied at personal income tax rates. When we think of business, the image that usually pops to mind is of the giant corporation: Google, General Motors, Procter & Gamble and their ilk. To be sure, these massive enterprises (known as “C” corporations) seem to dominate the business landscape and have their own tax rules, with a top federal rate of 35 percent. But behind the gigantic companies lie millions of smaller firms that aren’t C corporations. Their profits are “passed through” to the owners’ personal tax forms, where their business income is taxed at personal tax rates. The top federal rate is 43.4 percent, but the inclusion of state taxes can push that above 50 percent. Given the popularity of pass-through firms, they will likely play a big role in the tax debate. It also seems likely that they’ll push for lower taxes. This could be a major stumbling block, because (of course) tax cuts for pass-through firms will require spending cuts, tax increases on big C corporations, or larger budget deficits. How many pass-through firms are there and what’s their economic effect? You can be excused if you underestimate their impact. I certainly did. But a new report from the Tax Foundation, a think tank, dispels any notion that pass-through firms play a minor role in the economy. Here are some findings from the report: -- More than 90 percent of businesses in America are pass-through enterprises. In 2014, that was 28.3 million out of 30.8 million business establishments. -- Pass-through firms account for more than half of U.S. private-sector employment. In 2014, the number of workers at these firms totaled 73 million compared with 54 million at C corporations. -- The total profits of pass-through firms have surpassed the profits of C corporations. In 2012, the net income was $1.6 trillion for pass-through firms and $1.1 trillion for C corporations. Pass-through businesses come in three varieties: sole proprietorships (firms with one owner); partnerships; and “S” corporations, which are corporations receiving pass-through tax treatment. Their number has grown rapidly. In 1980, the Tax Foundation reports, there were more C corporation tax returns filed than the combined total of sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations. By 2012, the number of pass-through returns was more than four times greater than the returns from C corporations. It’s not entirely clear what explains this surge. One cause was the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which lowered the top personal rate to 28 percent from 50 percent; that created a powerful incentive for firms to adopt pass-through status, especially with a higher top tax rate for C corporations. But as personal tax rates have been raised, this incentive weakened. The top personal and business rates are now near or above 50 percent, including state taxes. (The top federal corporate rate is 35 percent; but there are also taxes on dividends and capital gains, with a top tax rate of 23.8 percent.) Another explanation for the popularity of pass-through status is the spread of limited-liability company laws in states, which allow firms to curtail damages in case they’re sued, says the Tax Foundation’s Scott Greenberg. Rather than facing two types of taxation -- corporate and personal -- business owners may simplify by choosing personal tax rates. Whatever the explanation, the many pass-through taxpayers loom over the impending tax reform debate. Interestingly, the Tax Foundation suggests that the pass-through treatment should remain because it doesn’t discriminate against labor income. It is “difficult to justify why income from pass-through businesses should be subject to lower tax rates than income from wages and salaries,” the report says. No way will this be easy -- and it’s not clear that overhauling business and personal taxes separately will make it any easier.

Read More NEW DELHI: Achhe din is back in sight for consumer goods companies, with the industry expecting consumption to bounce back from as early as next quarter as the impact of demonetisation fades away. The cash crunch post demonetisation did hurt them, said top industry executives. But they don’t expect it to last long or cause job losses. In fact, some of them have even started stepping up hiring in anticipation of a demand revival. “We have seen headwinds on demand, but there is no freeze on hiring or bonuses as growth will be back in the second and third quarters (of calendar 2017), and we have to be ready for that,” said Varun Berry, managing director at biscuit maker Britannia. PepsiCo India chairman D Shivakumar acknowledged the impact of demonetisation on the consumer goods industry. “But we are hiring in expectation of a consumption revival,” he added. Nestle, Procter & Gamble and Dabur also made similar views. Hindustan Unilever said it is business as usual for the company. Headhunters from Transearch, GlobalHunt and Korn Ferry said there was a slowdown in hiring at junior or middle levels in the FMCG sector after the November 8 demonetisation announcement, but that has changed now. In senior positions, there wasn’t any impact, they said. Neighbourhood stores that transact mostly in cash were among the biggest casualties of demonetisation, even as consumers visited modern retail outlets more frequently and paid electronically, cushioning the impact for the FMCG industry, company executives said. Across channels, the hit was mostly on non-premium categories targeting consumers with least purchasing power, but the highermargin premium products remained mostly insulated from the demand slowdown. While the situation is improving for both kirana stores and the organised ones in cities and big towns with easing money supply, rural markets remain a concern, said experts. “There was impact on demand and it was severe across consumer staples, considering that almost 90% of the sales traditionally happen across mom-and-pop stores,” Deloitte India partner Anil Talreja said. “But a demand and consumption recovery phase is kicking in and banks are returning to a level of normalcy. However, demand recovery in rural markets will take more time as transactions have been almost entirely cash dependent.” Rajat Wahi, partner and head (consumer markets) at KPMG, said even December was looking up in terms of demand, though the challenges on rural markets persisted. Arecent report from market researcher Nielsen confirmed the increasing consumer preference towards modern retail. With uncertainty over the availability of cash during November-December, modern trade shoppers took the opportunity to stock up, encouraged also by promotions and discounts from retailers and FMCG companies. In the two weeks after the currency ban, modern trade grew five times at a time when 70% neighbourhood groceries reported a fall in business, it said. Dabur chief executive Sunil Duggal said modern trade was an outperformer during the period of cash crunch that put pressure on the consumer goods industry. “We expect revival April onwards,” he added. According to the Nielsen report, even for grocery purchases, modern retail and online have become the channels of choice for many. This was perceptible in categories of household items (laundry, floor cleaner and utensil cleaner), personal care products (lotions, soaps and shampoos) and daily staples (milk, curd, fruits and vegetables). In the two weeks after demonetisation, packaged grocery saw 44% growth in modern retail sales compared with a year earlier, it said. Meanwhile, hirings at consumer goods companies are back to normal or picking up after a slowdown, executive search firms said, suggesting it as an indicator of improving demand situation in the industry. Hiring was slightly impacted till last month but that it is “back on track”, said Global-Hunt MD Sunil Goel.

Front St. in Florence. The community is invited to enjoy a cup of homemade chili in a handmade pottery bowl provided by P & G Pottery of Florence, for $5 each. Since the museum does not have a furnace, attendees should plan to dress warmly. Proceeds from the event go toward matching funds for a grant to help with infrastructure needs for the museum. Board Secretary Marty Lamm said last year's event raised nearly $3,000. The board needs to raise $35,000 to be able to add an HVAC system that won't stress artifacts by experiencing cold to hot temperatures. The museum closed in December because of cold temperatures and is expected to reopen for the season in mid-May, depending on weather conditions. During the 2016 season, 580 guests visited the museum from 32 states, the United Kingdom, Germany and Switzerland. During Saturday's event, attendees are invited to look at the museum's flag display, see the new light-up topographical map depicting where coal and oil deposits used to be in Florence, and learn more about the research center. For more information, visit www.florencepioneermuseum.org. Fremont County Republicans to host inauguration party Advertisement The Fremont County Republicans will host a potluck Inauguration Party from 6-8 p.m. Friday at Republican Headquarters, 603 Main St. to celebrate this historic inauguration of the country's new president, Donald Trump.

Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Tax "reform," starting with taxes on business, seems to be on everyone's agenda, and it may be a place where the incoming Trump administration and its Democratic critics find common ground. But it's still going to be a slog, and one reason is so-called "pass-through" businesses whose taxes are levied at personal income tax rates. When we think of business, the image that usually pops to mind is of the giant corporation: Google, General Motors, Procter & Gamble and their ilk. To be sure, these massive enterprises (known as "C" corporations) seem to dominate the business landscape and have their own tax rules, with a top federal rate of 35%. But behind the gigantic companies lie millions of smaller firms that aren't C corporations. Their profits are "passed through" to the owners' personal tax forms, where their business income is taxed at personal tax rates. The top federal rate is 43.4%, but the inclusion of state taxes can push that above 50%. Given the popularity of pass-through firms, they will likely play a big role in the tax debate. It also seems likely that they'll push for lower taxes. This could be a major stumbling block, because (of course) tax cuts for pass-through firms will require spending cuts, tax increases on big C corporations, or larger budget deficits. How many pass-through firms are there and what's their economic effect? You can be excused if you underestimate their impact. I certainly did. But a new report from the Tax Foundation, a think tank, dispels any notion that pass-through firms play a minor role in the economy. Here are some findings from the report: *     More than 90% of businesses in America are pass-through enterprises. In 2014, that was 28.3 million out of 30.8 million business establishments. *     Pass-through firms account for more than half of U.S. private-sector employment. In 2014, the number of workers at these firms totaled 73 million compared with 54 million at C corporations. *     The total profits of pass-through firms have surpassed the profits of C corporations. In 2012, the net income was $1.6 trillion for pass-through firms and $1.1 trillion for C corporations. Pass-through businesses come in three varieties: sole proprietorships (firms with one owner); partnerships; and "S" corporations, which are corporations receiving pass-through tax treatment. Their number has grown rapidly. In 1980, the Tax Foundation reports, there were more C corporation tax returns filed than the combined total of sole proprietorships, partnerships and S  corporations. By 2012, the number of pass-through returns was more than four times greater than the returns from C corporations. It's not entirely clear what explains this surge. One cause was the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which lowered the top personal rate to 28% from 50%; that created a powerful incentive for firms to adopt pass-through status, especially with a higher top tax rate for C corporations. But as personal tax rates have been raised, this incentive weakened. The top personal and business rates are now near or above 50%, including state taxes. (The top federal corporate rate is 35%; but there are also taxes on dividends and capital gains, with a top tax rate of 23.8%.) Another explanation for the popularity of pass-through status is the spread of limited-liability company laws in states, which allow firms to curtail damages in case they're sued, says the Tax Foundation's Scott Greenberg. Rather than facing two types of taxation — corporate and personal — business owners may simplify by choosing personal tax rates. Whatever the explanation, the many pass-through taxpayers loom over the impending tax reform debate. Interestingly, the Tax Foundation suggests that the pass-through treatment should remain because it doesn't discriminate against labor income. It is "difficult to justify why income from pass-through businesses should be subject to lower tax rates than income from wages and salaries," the report says. No way will this be easy — and it's not clear that overhauling business and personal taxes separately will make it any easier.

Global shares were steady in cautious trading Friday, Jan. 20, 2017, ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. China's report that its economy grew at a 6.8 percent pace in October-December was in line with expectations. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Materials companies led U.S. stocks modestly higher Friday, recouping much of the market's loss from a day earlier and snapping a 5-day losing streak for the Dow Jones industrial average. Another crop of encouraging company earnings news helped lift the market, but investors were mostly focused on events in Washington as Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. The major stock indexes pulled back slightly as Trump delivered remarks after taking the oath of office. Among topics of particular interest to Wall Street, the speech touched on trade and the Trump administration's intention of protecting the U.S. from "the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs." "The market is still embracing the Trump agenda, based on the market's reaction to the speech," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "Now the question the market has is, specifically, what does all of that mean in terms of trade?" The Dow rose 94.85 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,827.25. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 7.62 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,271.31. The Nasdaq composite index added 15.25 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,555.33. Despite Friday's gains, the three major stock indexes ended the week lower. Stocks have slowed in 2017 after surging for several weeks following Election Day on investor optimism that a Trump administration and Republican Congress would usher in business-friendly policies. But the possibility of increased tariffs or trade restrictions has also loomed as a potential drag in profits for big U.S. companies. "Historically, the market has performed best in the November-April time frame," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. "The Trump victory added a tailwind to this traditional seasonal factor." Typically, stocks don't do well on inauguration day. Going back to 1928, the S&P has averaged a drop of 1.05 percent on inauguration days, according Bespoke Investment Group. Beyond the presidential transition in Washington, investors pored over the latest batch of corporate earnings Friday, bidding up shares in companies that reported results that beat Wall Street's expectations. Skyworks Solutions jumped 13 percent, the biggest gainer in the S&P 500. The stock climbed $10.21 to $88.67. Citizens Financial Group gained $1.09, or 3.1 percent, to $35.82. Traders also drove up shares in Procter & Gamble after the consumer goods maker released a strong growth forecast. The stock added $2.75, or 3.2 percent, to $87.45. Strong subscriber numbers helped lift AT&T, giving a boost to phone company stocks overall. AT&T added 45 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $41.45. Some companies' earnings failed to impress the market. General Electric slid 2.2 percent after the conglomerate reported fourth-quarter revenue that fell short of analysts' forecasts. The stock gave up 68 cents to $30.53. Investors sold off Bristol-Myers Squibb after the drugmaker said it won't pursue accelerated regulatory approval for a two-drug lung cancer treatment. The stock was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 index, shedding $6.26, or 11.3 percent, to $49.23. Major stock indexes overseas were mixed Friday. Germany's DAX rose 0.3 percent, while Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. France's CAC 40 added 0.2 percent. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 0.7 percent after the Chinese government said the economy grew at a 6.8 percent annual rate in the last quarter, even as full-year growth increased 6.7 percent, the weakest in three decades. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.3 percent. Benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.05, or 2 percent, to close at $52.42 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added $1.33, or 2.5 percent, to close at $55.49 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline gained 3 cents to $1.57 a gallon and heating oil rose 3 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas slid 16 cents, or 4.9 percent, to $3.20 per 1,000 cubic feet. Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 2.47 percent. Yields have been rising as investors expect inflation to increase. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 114.31 yen from Thursday's 114.80 yen. The euro rose to $1.0707 from $1.0659. The British pound edged up to $1.2378 from $1.2337. Gold dropped $3.40 to settle at $1,204.90 an ounce, while silver fell 3 cents to $17.03 an ounce. Copper slipped a penny to $2.63 a pound. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You’re all set! Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Alex Veiga By Alex Veiga January 20 Materials companies led U.S. stocks modestly higher Friday, recouping much of the market’s loss from a day earlier and snapping a five-day losing streak for the Dow Jones industrial average. Another crop of encouraging company earnings news also helped lift the market, but investors were mostly focused on events in Washington as Donald Trump was sworn in as president. The major stock indexes pulled back slightly as Trump gave his inaugural address after taking the oath of office. Among topics of particular interest to Wall Street, the speech touched on trade and the Trump administration’s intention to protect the United States from “the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.” “The market is still embracing the Trump agenda, based on the market’s reaction to the speech,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. “Now the question the market has is, specifically, what does all of that mean in terms of trade?” The Dow rose 94.85 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,827.25. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index gained 7.62 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,271.31. The Nasdaq composite index added 15.25 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,555.33. Despite Friday’s gains, the three major stock indexes ended the week lower. Stocks have slowed in 2017 after surging for several weeks following Election Day on investor optimism that a Trump administration and Republican Congress would usher in business-friendly policies. But the possibility of increased tariffs or trade restrictions has also loomed as a potential drag on profits for big U.S. companies. “Historically, the market has performed best in the November-April time frame,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. “The Trump victory added a tail wind to this traditional seasonal factor.” Beyond the presidential transition in Washington, investors pored over the latest batch of corporate earnings Friday, bidding up shares in companies that reported results that beat Wall Street’s expectations. Skyworks Solutions jumped 13 percent, to $88.67, the biggest gainer in the S&P 500. Traders also drove up shares in Procter & Gamble after the consumer goods maker released a strong growth forecast. The stock grew 3.2 percent to $87.45. Strong subscriber numbers helped lift AT&T, giving a boost to phone company stocks overall. AT&T shares rose 1.1 percent to $41.45. Some companies’ earnings failed to impress the market. General Electric slid 2.2 percent after the conglomerate reported fourth-quarter revenue that fell short of analysts’ forecasts. Investors sold off Bristol-Myers Squibb after the drugmaker said it will not pursue accelerated regulatory approval for a two-drug lung cancer treatment. The stock was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 index, shedding 11.3 percent. Benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.05, or 2 percent, to close at $52.42 a barrel in New York. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline gained 3 cents to $1.57 a gallon, and heating oil rose 3 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas slid 16 cents, or 4.9 percent, to $3.20 per 1,000 cubic feet. Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 2.47 percent. Yields have been rising as investors expect inflation to increase. — Associated Press business economy true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

Another crop of encouraging company earnings news helped lift the market, but investors were mostly focused on events in Washington as Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. The major stock indexes pulled back slightly as Trump delivered remarks after taking the oath of office. Among topics of particular interest to Wall Street, the speech touched on trade and the Trump administration's intention of protecting the U.S. from "the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs." "The market is still embracing the Trump agenda, based on the market's reaction to the speech," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "Now the question the market has is, specifically, what does all of that mean in terms of trade?" The Dow rose 94.85 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,827.25. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 7.62 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,271.31. The Nasdaq composite index added 15.25 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,555.33. Despite Friday's gains, the three major stock indexes ended the week lower. Stocks have slowed in 2017 after surging for several weeks following Election Day on investor optimism that a Trump administration and Republican Congress would usher in business-friendly policies. But the possibility of increased tariffs or trade restrictions has also loomed as a potential drag in profits for big U.S. companies. "Historically, the market has performed best in the November-April time frame," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. "The Trump victory added a tailwind to this traditional seasonal factor." Typically, stocks don't do well on inauguration day. Going back to 1928, the S&P has averaged a drop of 1.05 percent on inauguration days, according Bespoke Investment Group. Beyond the presidential transition in Washington, investors pored over the latest batch of corporate earnings Friday, bidding up shares in companies that reported results that beat Wall Street's expectations. Skyworks Solutions jumped 13 percent, the biggest gainer in the S&P 500. The stock climbed $10.21 to $88.67. Citizens Financial Group gained $1.09, or 3.1 percent, to $35.82. Traders also drove up shares in Procter & Gamble after the consumer goods maker released a strong growth forecast. The stock added $2.75, or 3.2 percent, to $87.45. Strong subscriber numbers helped lift AT&T, giving a boost to phone company stocks overall. AT&T added 45 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $41.45. Some companies' earnings failed to impress the market. General Electric slid 2.2 percent after the conglomerate reported fourth-quarter revenue that fell short of analysts' forecasts. The stock gave up 68 cents to $30.53. Investors sold off Bristol-Myers Squibb after the drugmaker said it won't pursue accelerated regulatory approval for a two-drug lung cancer treatment. The stock was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 index, shedding $6.26, or 11.3 percent, to $49.23. Major stock indexes overseas were mixed Friday. Germany's DAX rose 0.3 percent, while Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. France's CAC 40 added 0.2 percent.

Equities traded higher in the morning and dipped beginning in the early afternoon, but the three major indexes have stayed in the green all day with about half an hour to go before the closing bell. WTI crude oil for February delivery settled at $52.42 a barrel, up about 2% on the day for a weekly gain of 0.1%. February gold added 0.3% on the day to settle at $1,204.90. Equities were headed for a higher close close shortly before the bell as the DJIA traded up 0.41% for the day, the S&P 500 traded up 0.23%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded up 0.15%.

Volume was about 70% higher than the daily average of around 11.2 million shares. The company had no specific news Friday, but rival Bristol-Myers said this morning that it would not see accelerated approval for its lung cancer drug and that leaves Merck in the driver’s seat. The Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) traded up 3.24% at $87.44. The stock’s 52-week range is $76.55 to $90.33. Volume was about double the daily average of around 9.3 million shares. The company reported good second-quarter sales growth and raised its fiscal year forecast. International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) traded up 1.97% at $170.10. The stock’s 52-week range is $116.90 to $170.62, a new 52-week high posted today. Volume was nearly 3 times the daily average of around 3.5 million shares. The company had no specific news. Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) traded up about 1.23% at $85.77. The stock’s 52-week range is $73.55 to $95.55. Volume was about 15% above the daily average of around 11.1 million shares.

Global shares were steady in cautious trading Friday, Jan. 20, 2017, ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. China's report that its economy grew at a 6.8 percent pace in October-December was in line with expectations. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Materials companies led U.S. stocks modestly higher Friday, recouping much of the market's loss from a day earlier and snapping a 5-day losing streak for the Dow Jones industrial average. Another crop of encouraging company earnings news helped lift the market, but investors were mostly focused on events in Washington as Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. The major stock indexes pulled back slightly as Trump delivered remarks after taking the oath of office. Among topics of particular interest to Wall Street, the speech touched on trade and the Trump administration's intention of protecting the U.S. from "the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs." "The market is still embracing the Trump agenda, based on the market's reaction to the speech," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "Now the question the market has is, specifically, what does all of that mean in terms of trade?" The Dow rose 94.85 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,827.25. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 7.62 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,271.31. The Nasdaq composite index added 15.25 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,555.33. Despite Friday's gains, the three major stock indexes ended the week lower. Stocks have slowed in 2017 after surging for several weeks following Election Day on investor optimism that a Trump administration and Republican Congress would usher in business-friendly policies. But the possibility of increased tariffs or trade restrictions has also loomed as a potential drag in profits for big U.S. companies. "Historically, the market has performed best in the November-April time frame," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. "The Trump victory added a tailwind to this traditional seasonal factor." Typically, stocks don't do well on inauguration day. Going back to 1928, the S&P has averaged a drop of 1.05 percent on inauguration days, according Bespoke Investment Group. Beyond the presidential transition in Washington, investors pored over the latest batch of corporate earnings Friday, bidding up shares in companies that reported results that beat Wall Street's expectations. Skyworks Solutions jumped 13 percent, the biggest gainer in the S&P 500. The stock climbed $10.21 to $88.67. Citizens Financial Group gained $1.09, or 3.1 percent, to $35.82. Traders also drove up shares in Procter & Gamble after the consumer goods maker released a strong growth forecast. The stock added $2.75, or 3.2 percent, to $87.45. Strong subscriber numbers helped lift AT&T, giving a boost to phone company stocks overall. AT&T added 45 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $41.45. Some companies' earnings failed to impress the market. General Electric slid 2.2 percent after the conglomerate reported fourth-quarter revenue that fell short of analysts' forecasts. The stock gave up 68 cents to $30.53. Investors sold off Bristol-Myers Squibb after the drugmaker said it won't pursue accelerated regulatory approval for a two-drug lung cancer treatment. The stock was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 index, shedding $6.26, or 11.3 percent, to $49.23. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

Another crop of encouraging company earnings news helped lift the market, but investors were mostly focused on events in Washington as Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. The major stock indexes pulled back slightly as Trump delivered remarks after taking the oath of office. Among topics of particular interest to Wall Street, the speech touched on trade and the Trump administration's intention of protecting the U.S. from "the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs." "The market is still embracing the Trump agenda, based on the market's reaction to the speech," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "Now the question the market has is, specifically, what does all of that mean in terms of trade?" The Dow rose 94.85 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,827.25. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 7.62 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,271.31. The Nasdaq composite index added 15.25 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,555.33. Despite Friday's gains, the three major stock indexes ended the week lower. Stocks have slowed in 2017 after surging for several weeks following Election Day on investor optimism that a Trump administration and Republican Congress would usher in business-friendly policies. But the possibility of increased tariffs or trade restrictions has also loomed as a potential drag in profits for big U.S. companies. "Historically, the market has performed best in the November-April time frame," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. "The Trump victory added a tailwind to this traditional seasonal factor." Typically, stocks don't do well on inauguration day. Going back to 1928, the S&P has averaged a drop of 1.05 percent on inauguration days, according Bespoke Investment Group. Beyond the presidential transition in Washington, investors pored over the latest batch of corporate earnings Friday, bidding up shares in companies that reported results that beat Wall Street's expectations. Skyworks Solutions jumped 13 percent, the biggest gainer in the S&P 500. The stock climbed $10.21 to $88.67. Citizens Financial Group gained $1.09, or 3.1 percent, to $35.82. Traders also drove up shares in Procter & Gamble after the consumer goods maker released a strong growth forecast. The stock added $2.75, or 3.2 percent, to $87.45. Strong subscriber numbers helped lift AT&T, giving a boost to phone company stocks overall. AT&T added 45 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $41.45. Some companies' earnings failed to impress the market. General Electric slid 2.2 percent after the conglomerate reported fourth-quarter revenue that fell short of analysts' forecasts. The stock gave up 68 cents to $30.53. Investors sold off Bristol-Myers Squibb after the drugmaker said it won't pursue accelerated regulatory approval for a two-drug lung cancer treatment. The stock was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 index, shedding $6.26, or 11.3 percent, to $49.23. Major stock indexes overseas were mixed Friday. Germany's DAX rose 0.3 percent, while Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. France's CAC 40 added 0.2 percent. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 0.7 percent after the Chinese government said the economy grew at a 6.8 percent annual rate in the last quarter, even as full-year growth increased 6.7 percent, the weakest in three decades. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.3 percent. Benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.05, or 2 percent, to close at $52.42 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added $1.33, or 2.5 percent, to close at $55.49 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline gained 3 cents to $1.57 a gallon and heating oil rose 3 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas slid 16 cents, or 4.9 percent, to $3.20 per 1,000 cubic feet. Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 2.47 percent. Yields have been rising as investors expect inflation to increase. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 114.31 yen from Thursday's 114.80 yen. The euro rose to $1.0707 from $1.0659. The British pound edged up to $1.2378 from $1.2337.

Another crop of encouraging company earnings news helped lift the market, but investors were mostly focused on events in Washington as Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. The major stock indexes pulled back slightly as Trump delivered remarks after taking the oath of office. Among topics of particular interest to Wall Street, the speech touched on trade and the Trump administration's intention of protecting the U.S. from "the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs." "The market is still embracing the Trump agenda, based on the market's reaction to the speech," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "Now the question the market has is, specifically, what does all of that mean in terms of trade?" The Dow rose 94.85 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,827.25. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 7.62 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,271.31. The Nasdaq composite index added 15.25 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,555.33. Despite Friday's gains, the three major stock indexes ended the week lower. Stocks have slowed in 2017 after surging for several weeks following Election Day on investor optimism that a Trump administration and Republican Congress would usher in business-friendly policies. But the possibility of increased tariffs or trade restrictions has also loomed as a potential drag in profits for big U.S. companies. "Historically, the market has performed best in the November-April time frame," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. "The Trump victory added a tailwind to this traditional seasonal factor." Typically, stocks don't do well on inauguration day. Going back to 1928, the S&P has averaged a drop of 1.05 percent on inauguration days, according Bespoke Investment Group. Beyond the presidential transition in Washington, investors pored over the latest batch of corporate earnings Friday, bidding up shares in companies that reported results that beat Wall Street's expectations. Skyworks Solutions jumped 13 percent, the biggest gainer in the S&P 500. The stock climbed $10.21 to $88.67. Citizens Financial Group gained $1.09, or 3.1 percent, to $35.82. Traders also drove up shares in Procter & Gamble after the consumer goods maker released a strong growth forecast. The stock added $2.75, or 3.2 percent, to $87.45. Strong subscriber numbers helped lift AT&T, giving a boost to phone company stocks overall. AT&T added 45 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $41.45. Some companies' earnings failed to impress the market. General Electric slid 2.2 percent after the conglomerate reported fourth-quarter revenue that fell short of analysts' forecasts. The stock gave up 68 cents to $30.53. Investors sold off Bristol-Myers Squibb after the drugmaker said it won't pursue accelerated regulatory approval for a two-drug lung cancer treatment. The stock was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 index, shedding $6.26, or 11.3 percent, to $49.23. Major stock indexes overseas were mixed Friday. Germany's DAX rose 0.3 percent, while Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. France's CAC 40 added 0.2 percent. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 0.7 percent after the Chinese government said the economy grew at a 6.8 percent annual rate in the last quarter, even as full-year growth increased 6.7 percent, the weakest in three decades. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.3 percent. Benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.05, or 2 percent, to close at $52.42 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added $1.33, or 2.5 percent, to close at $55.49 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline gained 3 cents to $1.57 a gallon and heating oil rose 3 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas slid 16 cents, or 4.9 percent, to $3.20 per 1,000 cubic feet. Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 2.47 percent. Yields have been rising as investors expect inflation to increase. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 114.31 yen from Thursday's 114.80 yen. The euro rose to $1.0707 from $1.0659. The British pound edged up to $1.2378 from $1.2337. Gold dropped $3.40 to settle at $1,204.90 an ounce, while silver fell 3 cents to $17.03 an ounce. Copper slipped a penny to $2.63 a pound. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Dow industrials rose in afternoon trading Friday following the inauguration of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States. By Alex Veiga | PUBLISHED: January 20, 2017 at 10:13 am | UPDATED: January 20, 2017 at 12:06 pm Stocks edged higher in afternoon trading Friday following Donald Trump’s swearing in as the 45th president of the United States. Phone companies, real estate and materials stocks were among the biggest gainers. Health care and industrial companies lagged the broader market. Investors were also weighing the latest batch of company earnings news. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average rose 55 points, or 0.3 percent, to 19,787 as of 2:20 p.m. Eastern Time. The Dow is coming off five straight losses. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index gained 4 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,268. The Nasdaq composite index added 9 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,549. THE QUOTE: An overall improvement in quarterly results so far this corporate earnings season as well as optimism over the Trump inauguration helped lift stocks, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. “Historically, the market has performed best in the November-April time frame,” Stovall said. “The Trump victory added a tailwind to this traditional seasonal factor.” TRUMP’S INAUGURATION: The major stock indexes pulled back slightly as Trump delivered remarks after taking the oath of office. Stocks have slowed in 2017 after surging for several weeks following Election Day on investor optimism that a Trump administration and Republican congress would usher in business-friendly policies. But the possibility of increased tariffs or trade restrictions could also mean drops in profits for big U.S. companies. Since 1953, starting with President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s inauguration, the S&P 500 has risen an average of 1.6 percent in the first 100 days of a president’s first term in office, Stovall noted. STRONG RESULTS: Skyworks Solutions jumped 12.1 percent after the semiconductor products maker reported better-than-anticipated quarterly results. The stock was the biggest gainer in the S&P 500, adding $9.50 to $87.94. BRIGHT OUTLOOK: Consumer goods maker Procter & Gamble rose 2.7 percent after releasing a strong growth forecast. The stock added $2.32 to $87.02. EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS: Citizens Financial Group gained 2.2 percent after reporting fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that beat analysts’ expectations. The stock rose 76 cents to $35.49. GOOD CALL: AT&T rose 1.2 percent after the phone company reported strong subscriber numbers. The stock added 49 cents to $41.49. NOT GOOD ENOUGH: General Electric slid 2.2 percent after the conglomerate reported fourth-quarter revenue that fell short of analysts’ forecasts. The stock gave up 69 cents to $30.52. SLOW APPROACH: Bristol-Myers Squibb slumped 10.7 percent after the drugmaker said it won’t pursue accelerated regulatory approval for a lung cancer treatment. The stock was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 index, shedding $5.92 to $49.57. MARKETS OVERSEAS: Germany’s DAX rose 0.3 percent, while France’s CAC 40 added 0.2 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. In Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng shed 0.7 percent after the Chinese government said the economy grew at a 6.8 percent annual rate in the last quarter, even as full-year growth increased 6.7 percent, the weakest in three decades. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index rose 0.3 percent. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude was up $1.12, or 2.2 percent, at $52.49 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, was up $1.26, or 2.3 percent, at $55.42 a barrel in London. BONDS: Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 2.47 percent. Yields have been rising as investors expect inflation to increase. CURRENCIES: The dollar fell to 114.62 yen from Thursday’s 114.80. The euro rose to $1.0687 from $1.0659. METALS: Gold dropped $3.40 to settle at $1,204.90 an ounce, while silver fell 3 cents to $17.03 an ounce. Copper slipped a penny to $2.63 a pound. Tags:  Economy Alex Veiga Subscribe Today!

Stocks edge higher, snapping a 5-day losing streak for Dow by: ALEX VEIGA, AP Business Writer Updated: Jan 20, 2017 - 4:19 PM Twtter Materials companies led U.S. stocks modestly higher Friday, recouping much of the market's loss from a day earlier and snapping a 5-day losing streak for the Dow Jones industrial average. Another crop of encouraging company earnings news helped lift the market, but investors were mostly focused on events in Washington as Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. The major stock indexes pulled back slightly as Trump delivered remarks after taking the oath of office. Among topics of particular interest to Wall Street, the speech touched on trade and the Trump administration's intention of protecting the U.S. from "the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs." "The market is still embracing the Trump agenda, based on the market's reaction to the speech," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "Now the question the market has is, specifically, what does all of that mean in terms of trade?" The Dow rose 94.85 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,827.25. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 7.62 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,271.31. The Nasdaq composite index added 15.25 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,555.33. Despite Friday's gains, the three major stock indexes ended the week lower. Stocks have slowed in 2017 after surging for several weeks following Election Day on investor optimism that a Trump administration and Republican Congress would usher in business-friendly policies. But the possibility of increased tariffs or trade restrictions has also loomed as a potential drag in profits for big U.S. companies. "Historically, the market has performed best in the November-April time frame," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. "The Trump victory added a tailwind to this traditional seasonal factor." Typically, stocks don't do well on inauguration day. Going back to 1928, the S&P has averaged a drop of 1.05 percent on inauguration days, according Bespoke Investment Group. Beyond the presidential transition in Washington, investors pored over the latest batch of corporate earnings Friday, bidding up shares in companies that reported results that beat Wall Street's expectations. Skyworks Solutions jumped 13 percent, the biggest gainer in the S&P 500. The stock climbed $10.21 to $88.67. Citizens Financial Group gained $1.09, or 3.1 percent, to $35.82. Traders also drove up shares in Procter & Gamble after the consumer goods maker released a strong growth forecast. The stock added $2.75, or 3.2 percent, to $87.45. Strong subscriber numbers helped lift AT&T, giving a boost to phone company stocks overall. AT&T added 45 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $41.45. Some companies' earnings failed to impress the market. General Electric slid 2.2 percent after the conglomerate reported fourth-quarter revenue that fell short of analysts' forecasts. The stock gave up 68 cents to $30.53. Investors sold off Bristol-Myers Squibb after the drugmaker said it won't pursue accelerated regulatory approval for a two-drug lung cancer treatment. The stock was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 index, shedding $6.26, or 11.3 percent, to $49.23. Major stock indexes overseas were mixed Friday. Germany's DAX rose 0.3 percent, while Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. France's CAC 40 added 0.2 percent. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 0.7 percent after the Chinese government said the economy grew at a 6.8 percent annual rate in the last quarter, even as full-year growth increased 6.7 percent, the weakest in three decades. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.3 percent. Benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.05, or 2 percent, to close at $52.42 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added $1.33, or 2.5 percent, to close at $55.49 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline gained 3 cents to $1.57 a gallon and heating oil rose 3 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas slid 16 cents, or 4.9 percent, to $3.20 per 1,000 cubic feet. Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 2.47 percent. Yields have been rising as investors expect inflation to increase. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 114.31 yen from Thursday's 114.80 yen. The euro rose to $1.0707 from $1.0659. The British pound edged up to $1.2378 from $1.2337. Gold dropped $3.40 to settle at $1,204.90 an ounce, while silver fell 3 cents to $17.03 an ounce. Copper slipped a penny to $2.63 a pound. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Text of Trump executive order suspending refugee admissions Published: Friday, January 27, 2017 @ 8:44 PM Updated: Friday, January 27, 2017 @ 9:18 PM By: Jamie Dupree ARLINGTON, VA - JANUARY 27: U.S. President Donald Trump signs executive orders in the Hall of Heroes at the Department of Defense on January 27, 2017 in Arlington, Virginia. Trump signed two orders calling for the "great rebuilding" of the nation's military and the "extreme vetting" of visa seekers from terror-plagued countries. (Photo by Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images) (Pool) The White House has released the specific text of the executive order signed on Friday afternoon by President Donald Trump, which would suspend refugee admissions into the United States for 120 days, blocking visas for some Muslims by singling out seven specific nations, as Mr. Trump said it was necessary to protect Americans from possible terror threats. >> Read more trending news  “We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas,” President Trump said during a visit to the Pentagon. “We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people,” he added. Here is the text of the president’s executive order: PROTECTING the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States      By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and to protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals admitted to the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:      Section 1.  Purpose.  The visa-issuance process plays a crucial role in detecting individuals with terrorist ties and stopping them from entering the United States.  Perhaps in no instance was that more apparent than the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, when State Department policy prevented consular officers from properly scrutinizing the visa applications of several of the 19 foreign nationals who went on to murder nearly 3,000 Americans.  And while the visa-issuance process was reviewed and amended after the September 11 attacks to better detect would-be terrorists from receiving visas, these measures did not stop attacks by foreign nationals who were admitted to the United States.      Numerous foreign-born individuals have been convicted or implicated in terrorism-related crimes since September 11, 2001, including foreign nationals who entered the United States after receiving visitor, student, or employment visas, or who entered through the United States refugee resettlement program. Deteriorating conditions in certain countries due to war, strife, disaster, and civil unrest increase the likelihood that terrorists will use any means possible to enter the United States.  The United States must be vigilant during the visa-issuance process to ensure that those approved for admission do not intend to harm Americans and that they have no ties to terrorism.      In order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles.  The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law.  In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including “honor” killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation.      Sec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks in the United States; and to prevent the admission of foreign nationals who intend to exploit United States immigration laws for malevolent purposes.      Sec. 3.  Suspension of Issuance of Visas and Other Immigration Benefits to Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern.  (a)  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall immediately conduct a review to determine the information needed from any country to adjudicate any visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual seeking the benefit is who the individual claims to be and is not a security or public-safety threat.      (b)  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President a report on the results of the review described in subsection (a) of this section, including the Secretary of Homeland Security’s determination of the information needed for adjudications and a list of countries that do not provide adequate information, within 30 days of the date of this order.  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide a copy of the report to the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence.      (c)  To temporarily reduce investigative burdens on relevant agencies during the review period described in subsection (a) of this section, to ensure the proper review and maximum utilization of available resources for the screening of foreign nationals, and to ensure that adequate standards are established to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists or criminals, pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens from countries referred to in section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of such persons for 90 days from the date of this order (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas).      (d)  Immediately upon receipt of the report described in subsection (b) of this section regarding the information needed for adjudications, the Secretary of State shall request all foreign governments that do not supply such information to start providing such information regarding their nationals within 60 days of notification.      (e)  After the 60-day period described in subsection (d) of this section expires, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the President a list of countries recommended for inclusion on a Presidential proclamation that would prohibit the entry of foreign nationals (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas) from countries that do not provide the information requested pursuant to subsection (d) of this section until compliance occurs.      (f)  At any point after submitting the list described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security may submit to the President the names of any additional countries recommended for similar treatment.      (g)  Notwithstanding a suspension pursuant to subsection (c) of this section or pursuant to a Presidential proclamation described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may, on a case-by-case basis, and when in the national interest, issue visas or other immigration benefits to nationals of countries for which visas and benefits are otherwise blocked.      (h)  The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall submit to the President a joint report on the progress in implementing this order within 30 days of the date of this order, a second report within 60 days of the date of this order, a third report within 90 days of the date of this order, and a fourth report within 120 days of the date of this order.      Sec. 4.  Implementing Uniform Screening Standards for All Immigration Programs.  (a)  The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall implement a program, as part of the adjudication process for immigration benefits, to identify individuals seeking to enter the United States on a fraudulent basis with the intent to cause harm, or who are at risk of causing harm subsequent to their admission. This program will include the development of a uniform screening standard and procedure, such as in-person interviews; a database of identity documents proffered by applicants to ensure that duplicate documents are not used by multiple applicants; amended application forms that include questions aimed at identifying fraudulent answers and malicious intent; a mechanism to ensure that the applicant is who the applicant claims to be; a process to evaluate the applicant’s likelihood of becoming a positively contributing member of society and the applicant’s ability to make contributions to the national interest; and a mechanism to assess whether or not the applicant has the intent to commit criminal or terrorist acts after entering the United States      (b)  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Secretary of State, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of this directive within 60 days of the date of this order, a second report within 100 days of the date of this order, and a third report within 200 days of the date of this order.      Sec. 5.  Realignment of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for Fiscal Year 2017.  (a)  The Secretary of State shall suspend the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for 120 days.  During the 120-day period, the Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Secretary of Homeland Security and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, shall review the USRAP application and adjudication process to determine what additional procedures should be taken to ensure that those approved for refugee admission do not pose a threat to the security and welfare of the United States, and shall implement such additional procedures.  Refugee applicants who are already in the USRAP process may be admitted upon the initiation and completion of these revised procedures.  Upon the date that is 120 days after the date of this order, the Secretary of State shall resume USRAP admissions only for nationals of countries for which the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence have jointly determined that such additional procedures are adequate to ensure the security and welfare of the United States.      (b)  Upon the resumption of USRAP admissions, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, is further directed to make changes, to the extent permitted by law, to prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual’s country of nationality.  Where necessary and appropriate, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall recommend legislation to the President that would assist with such prioritization.      (c)  Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I have determined that sufficient changes have been made to the USRAP to ensure that admission of Syrian refugees is consistent with the national interest.      (d)  Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the entry of more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017 would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I determine that additional admissions would be in the national interest.      (e)  Notwithstanding the temporary suspension imposed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may jointly determine to admit individuals to the United States as refugees on a case-by-case basis, in their discretion, but only so long as they determine that the admission of such individuals as refugees is in the national interest — including when the person is a religious minority in his country of nationality facing religious persecution, when admitting the person would enable the United States to conform its conduct to a preexisting international agreement, or when the person is already in transit and denying admission would cause undue hardship — and it would not pose a risk to the security or welfare of the United States.      (f)  The Secretary of State shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of the directive in subsection (b) of this section regarding prioritization of claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution within 100 days of the date of this order and shall submit a second report within 200 days of the date of this order.      (g)  It is the policy of the executive branch that, to the extent permitted by law and as practicable, State and local jurisdictions be granted a role in the process of determining the placement or settlement in their jurisdictions of aliens eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees.  To that end, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall examine existing law to determine the extent to which, consistent with applicable law, State and local jurisdictions may have greater involvement in the process of determining the placement or resettlement of refugees in their jurisdictions, and shall devise a proposal to lawfully promote such involvement.      Sec. 6.  Rescission of Exercise of Authority Relating to the Terrorism Grounds of Inadmissibility.  The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall, in consultation with the Attorney General, consider rescinding the exercises of authority in section 212 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182, relating to the terrorism grounds of inadmissibility, as well as any related implementing memoranda.      Sec. 7.  Expedited Completion of the Biometric Entry-Exit Tracking System.  (a)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall expedite the completion and implementation of a biometric entry-exit tracking system for all travelers to the United States, as recommended by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States.      (b)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the President periodic reports on the progress of the directive contained in subsection (a) of this section.  The initial report shall be submitted within 100 days of the date of this order, a second report shall be submitted within 200 days of the date of this order, and a third report shall be submitted within 365 days of the date of this order.  Further, the Secretary shall submit a report every 180 days thereafter until the system is fully deployed and operational.      Sec. 8.  Visa Interview Security.  (a)  The Secretary of State shall immediately suspend the Visa Interview Waiver Program and ensure compliance with section 222 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1222, which requires that all individuals seeking a nonimmigrant visa undergo an in-person interview, subject to specific statutory exceptions.      (b)  To the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary of State shall immediately expand the Consular Fellows Program, including by substantially increasing the number of Fellows, lengthening or making permanent the period of service, and making language training at the Foreign Service Institute available to Fellows for assignment to posts outside of their area of core linguistic ability, to ensure that non-immigrant visa-interview wait times are not unduly affected.      Sec. 9.  Visa Validity Reciprocity.  The Secretary of State shall review all nonimmigrant visa reciprocity agreements to ensure that they are, with respect to each visa classification, truly reciprocal insofar as practicable with respect to validity period and fees, as required by sections 221(c) and 281 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1201(c) and 1351, and other treatment.  If a country does not treat United States nationals seeking nonimmigrant visas in a reciprocal manner, the Secretary of State shall adjust the visa validity period, fee schedule, or other treatment to match the treatment of United States nationals by the foreign country, to the extent practicable.      Sec. 10.  Transparency and Data Collection.  (a)  To be more transparent with the American people, and to more effectively implement policies and practices that serve the national interest, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall, consistent with applicable law and national security, collect and make publicly available within 180 days, and every 180 days thereafter: (i)   information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been charged with terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; convicted of terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; or removed from the United States based on terrorism-related activity, affiliation, or material support to a terrorism-related organization, or any other national security reasons since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later; (ii)   information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been radicalized after entry into the United States and engaged in terrorism-related acts, or who have provided material support to terrorism-related organizations in countries that pose a threat to the United States, since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later; and (iii)  information regarding the number and types of acts of gender-based violence against women, including honor killings, in the United States by foreign nationals, since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later; and (iv)   any other information relevant to public safety and security as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General, including information on the immigration status of foreign nationals charged with major offenses.      (b)  The Secretary of State shall, within one year of the date of this order, provide a report on the estimated long-term costs of the USRAP at the Federal, State, and local levels.      Sec. 11.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.      (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.      (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.                                DONALD J. TRUMP   THE WHITE HOUSE,     January 27, 2017. Woman who claimed Emmett Till whistled at her says she made it up in new book Published: Friday, January 27, 2017 @ 6:26 PM Updated: Friday, January 27, 2017 @ 6:26 PM By: Kelcie Willis - Cox Media Group National Content Desk ALSIP, IL - MAY 4: A plaque marks the gravesite of Emmett Till at Burr Oak Cemetery in Aslip, Illinois. The woman who made claims that lead to Till's brutal murder in 1955 says in a new book she made up most of the claims, according to a report from Vanity Fair. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) A new book by Duke University senior research scholar Timothy Tyson seems to claim that the woman who said 14-year-old Emmett Till whistled at her, leading to the teen's brutal beating and murder, fabricated her story, according to Vanity Fair. >> Read more trending stories According to the story, Till, a black boy visiting family in Money, Mississippi, on Aug. 24, 1955, from Chicago, went to Bryant's Grocery and Meat Market and either whistled, catcalled, caressed, flirted with or otherwise spoke to Carolyn Bryant, a 21-year-old white woman working in the store. Four days later, Bryant's then-husband, Roy Bryant, and his half-brother J.W. Milam abducted Till from his great-uncle Moses Wright's house, beat and mutilated him, dragged him to the Tallahatchie River and shot him in the head, killing him. The two then tied Till up with barbed wire with a metal fan attached and tossed his body into the river. His body was pulled from the river three days later, on Aug. 31. Till's mutilated, unrecognizable face was plastered across black publications Jet magazine and the Chicago Defender when his mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, held an open-casket funeral for her son, saying she left his body on display for five days to "let the world see what has happened." In the trial against Milam and Bryant after their arrest, Vanity Fair reported that Carolyn Bryant testified that Till grabbed and threatened her. "I was just scared to death," she said. On Sept. 23, 1955, a jury of white males acquitted Bryant and Milam of all charges. Since then, Bryant has disappeared from public view. Now 82 years old, her family has kept her whereabouts a secret. In Tyson's new book, "The Blood of Emmett Till," he said Carolyn Bryant Donham -- who divorced Bryant and has married twice since then -- admits she lied about most of the accusations. Tyson spoke to Bryant in 2007, when she was 72 years old. "That part’s not true," she said, referring to the claims of verbal and physical advances Till made on her When asked if she remembered anything else that happened that night at the store, she said she couldn't. Tyson is the only person to have interviewed Bryant. According to Vanity Fair, she reached out to Tyson when writing her own memoirs because she admired one of his earlier books. "Nothing that boy did could ever justify what happened to him," Bryant told Tyson, adding that she related to Till-Mobley when one of her own sons died, saying she "felt tender sorrow." Vanity Fair reported that Tyson did not say whether Bryant definitively expressed guilt. If Till were alive today, he would be 75 years old. Decades later, the image of Till's open casket and his story continues to be one of the biggest examples of racism and civil rights injustice in America. ‘Can you hear me?’ Don’t answer that! Published: Friday, January 27, 2017 @ 1:09 AM Updated: Friday, January 27, 2017 @ 6:12 PM By: Bob D'Angelo - Cox Media Group National Content Desk "Can You Hear Me?" New Phone Scam Warning! UPDATE: The website dedicated to covering urban legends, Snopes.com, has indicated that the scam may be unproven. In their investigation, they were unable to find any documented cases of the scam. EARLIER: It seems harmless enough. A person answers the telephone or a cellphone, and the voice on the other end asks "Can you hear me?" >> Read more trending news Don’t say yes, officials warn. In fact, don’t say anything. One word could make a person the victim of a scam that is circulating across the United States, CBS News reported. A person's affirmative response can be recorded and used to authorize unwanted charges on a telephone or utility bill or a stolen credit card, CBS News reported. When payment is demanded and that person refuses, the caller may produce the previously recorded assent, the Idaho Statesman reported. "You say 'yes,' it gets recorded and they say that you have agreed to something," Susan Grant, director of consumer protection for the Consumer Federation of America, told CBS News. "I know that people think it’s impolite to hang up, but it’s a good strategy." But if the caller has not provided a payment method, how can he or she be charged? The con artist already has your phone number, CBS News reported, and many phone providers pass through third-party charges.  What can you do? If you suspect you have already been victimized, check your credit card, phone and cable statements carefully for any unfamiliar charges. Call the billing company and dispute any unfamiliar charge authorizations. If the caller asks you to press a button to be placed on the Do Not Call Registry, hang up, the Idaho Statesman reported. Saying anything or pressing buttons when prompted may help scam artists determine that you have an active phone number. Remember that no government agency will ever solicit for the Do Not Call Registry, but you can register your number at DoNotCall.gov. This will stop legitimate telemarketers and business from soliciting you, but not scammers. So, if you are on the list and get a call, you can be that much more confident it’s a scam. Officials urge people to be skeptical when taking a call from an unfamiliar number, the Idaho Statesman reported. If a caller is asking questions that would generate a "yes" response, a good answer is "Who are you, and why do you want to know?" Related Phone 3 hours ago What are sanctuary cities? Here's a list of sanctuary cities, counties, states Published: Thursday, January 26, 2017 @ 9:53 PM Updated: Thursday, January 26, 2017 @ 9:53 PM By: Debbie Lord - Cox Media Group National Content Desk What Is A Sanctuary City? Editor's Note: A previous version of this story contained information that indicated Butler and Westmoreland counties in Pennsylvania are sanctuary cities. After receiving conflicting information about their status, those counties have been removed from this list. President Donald Trump ordered cuts in federal grants Wednesday for cities that protect offer safe harbor for undocumented immigrants. The “sanctuary cities” could lose millions of federal grant dollars once the order takes effect. There are more than 140 sanctuary jurisdictions  – states, counties and cities – where the local governments have, either by law or by practice, enacted a policy of protecting undocumented aliens by refusing to prosecute  them for violating federal immigration laws. While Trump signed the executive order on Wednesday, according to the Associated Press, the administration may face legal challenges, given that some federal courts have found that cities or counties cannot hold immigrants beyond their jail terms or deny them bond based only on a request from immigration authorities.

"From this day forward it is going to be only America first," Trump said after being sworn in, adding that the U.S. policy will be to buy American and hire American. Trump's campaign promises of tax and regulatory reforms and higher infrastructure spending had driven Wall Street to new highs in a post-election rally. However, the Trump trade had been unraveling in recent weeks as investors waited for more clarity on his plans to boost the economy. "Having listened to Trump's speech, there is a concern about what his trade policies will be," said Jamie Cox, managing partner of Harris Financial Group in Colonial Heights, Richmond, Virginia. "That's probably the No.1 area where Trump will have to tone down his rhetoric because we do have to work with other nations," said Cox, who was at the inauguration. The S&P 500 has fallen by a median 2.7 percent in the month after each new president has taken the keys to the White House since Herbert Hoover did so in January 1929, according to a Reuters analysis. The dollar index weakened as Trump spoke, while gold , which was trading lower ahead of the inauguration, moved into positive territory. At 12:33 a.m. ET (1733 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 31.96 points, or 0.16 percent, at 19,764.36. The S&P 500 was up 1.85 points, or 0.08 percent, at 2,265.54 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.50 points, or 0.06 percent, at 5,543.59. Eight of the 11 major S&P indexes were higher, with technology giving the biggest bump to the broader index. Industrials, utilities health stocks were the outliers. Among stocks, Procter & Gamble was the top stock on the S&P and the Dow, rising 3.6 percent after the consumer products maker reported quarterly sales and profit above expectations. Merck rose 3.8 percent to $62.60 after Bristol-Myers said it would not seek accelerated U.S. approval for a combination of its two immunotherapy drugs as an initial treatment for lung cancer, giving Merck an advantage in the lucrative market. Bristol-Myers' stock was down 9.2 percent. Walgreens dropped 2.5 percent after Bloomberg reported that the FTC was not satisfied with its plan to divest stores to win antitrust clearance for its acquisition of Rite Aid. Shares of Rite Aid lost nearly 12 percent on the news. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,787 to 1,021. On the Nasdaq, 1,693 issues rose and 1,044 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 19 new 52-week highs and five new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 67 new highs and 26 new lows.

Richard Drew FILE - In this Friday, Nov. 13, 2015, file photo, the American flag flies above the Wall Street entrance to the New York Stock Exchange. Global shares were steady in cautious trading Friday, Jan. 20, 2017, ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. China's report that its economy grew at a 6.8 percent pace in October-December was in line with expectations. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Materials companies led U.S. stocks modestly higher Friday, recouping much of the market's loss from a day earlier and snapping a 5-day losing streak for the Dow Jones industrial average. Another crop of encouraging company earnings news helped lift the market, but investors were mostly focused on events in Washington as Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. The major stock indexes pulled back slightly as Trump delivered remarks after taking the oath of office. Among topics of particular interest to Wall Street, the speech touched on trade and the Trump administration's intention of protecting the U.S. from "the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs." Story continues below video × Advertisement "The market is still embracing the Trump agenda, based on the market's reaction to the speech," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "Now the question the market has is, specifically, what does all of that mean in terms of trade?" The Dow rose 94.85 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,827.25. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 7.62 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,271.31. The Nasdaq composite index added 15.25 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,555.33. Despite Friday's gains, the three major stock indexes ended the week lower. Stocks have slowed in 2017 after surging for several weeks following Election Day on investor optimism that a Trump administration and Republican Congress would usher in business-friendly policies. But the possibility of increased tariffs or trade restrictions has also loomed as a potential drag in profits for big U.S. companies. "Historically, the market has performed best in the November-April time frame," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. "The Trump victory added a tailwind to this traditional seasonal factor." Typically, stocks don't do well on inauguration day. Going back to 1928, the S&P has averaged a drop of 1.05 percent on inauguration days, according Bespoke Investment Group. Beyond the presidential transition in Washington, investors pored over the latest batch of corporate earnings Friday, bidding up shares in companies that reported results that beat Wall Street's expectations. Skyworks Solutions jumped 13 percent, the biggest gainer in the S&P 500. The stock climbed $10.21 to $88.67. Citizens Financial Group gained $1.09, or 3.1 percent, to $35.82. Traders also drove up shares in Procter & Gamble after the consumer goods maker released a strong growth forecast. The stock added $2.75, or 3.2 percent, to $87.45. Strong subscriber numbers helped lift AT&T, giving a boost to phone company stocks overall. AT&T added 45 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $41.45. Some companies' earnings failed to impress the market. General Electric slid 2.2 percent after the conglomerate reported fourth-quarter revenue that fell short of analysts' forecasts. The stock gave up 68 cents to $30.53. Investors sold off Bristol-Myers Squibb after the drugmaker said it won't pursue accelerated regulatory approval for a two-drug lung cancer treatment. The stock was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 index, shedding $6.26, or 11.3 percent, to $49.23. Major stock indexes overseas were mixed Friday. Germany's DAX rose 0.3 percent, while Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. France's CAC 40 added 0.2 percent. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 0.7 percent after the Chinese government said the economy grew at a 6.8 percent annual rate in the last quarter, even as full-year growth increased 6.7 percent, the weakest in three decades. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.3 percent. Benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.05, or 2 percent, to close at $52.42 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added $1.33, or 2.5 percent, to close at $55.49 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline gained 3 cents to $1.57 a gallon and heating oil rose 3 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas slid 16 cents, or 4.9 percent, to $3.20 per 1,000 cubic feet. Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 2.47 percent. Yields have been rising as investors expect inflation to increase. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 114.31 yen from Thursday's 114.80 yen. The euro rose to $1.0707 from $1.0659. The British pound edged up to $1.2378 from $1.2337. Gold dropped $3.40 to settle at $1,204.90 an ounce, while silver fell 3 cents to $17.03 an ounce. Copper slipped a penny to $2.63 a pound.

Phone company stocks led the gainers. Energy stocks also rose as oil prices headed higher. Investors also had their eye on the latest batch of company earnings and outlooks. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average rose 99 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,831 as of 11:07 a.m. Eastern Time. The Dow is coming off five straight losses and turned positive for the year again. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 10 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,274. The Nasdaq composite index added 21 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,561. THE QUOTE: An overall improvement in quarterly results so far this corporate earnings season as well as optimism over the Trump inauguration helped lift stocks, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. "Historically, the market has performed best in the November-April time frame," Stovall said. "The Trump victory added a tailwind to this traditional seasonal factor." TRUMP'S INAUGURATION: Investors will be looking for clues in Trump's midday inauguration speech about his plans on fiscal stimulus, tax cuts and trade. Expectations of lower taxes and less regulation on businesses gave stocks a boost for much of the last two months of 2016. But the possibility of increased tariffs or trade restrictions could mean drops in profits for big U.S. companies. Since 1953, starting with President Dwight D. Eisenhower's inauguration, the S&P 500 has risen an average of 1.6 percent in the first 100 days of a president's first term in office, Stovall noted. STRONG RESULTS: Skyworks Solutions jumped 12.4 percent after the semiconductor products maker reported better-than-anticipated quarterly results. The stock was the biggest gainer in the S&P 500, adding $9.72 to $88.18. BRIGHT OUTLOOK: Consumer goods maker Procter & Gamble rose 3.8 percent after releasing a strong growth forecast. The stock added $3.24 to $87.94. EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS: Citizens Financial Group gained 2.9 percent after reporting fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that beat analysts' expectations. The stock rose $1 to $35.73. BIG DECLINER: TransDigm Group was down the most among stocks in the S&P 500. It slumped $31.63, or 12.6 percent, to $220.13. MARKETS OVERSEAS: Germany's DAX rose 0.2 percent, while France's CAC 40 was 0.2 percent higher. Britain's FTSE 100 was down 0.1 percent. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 0.7 percent after the Chinese government said the economy grew at a 6.8 percent annual rate in the last quarter, even as full-year growth increased 6.7 percent, the weakest in three decades. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.3 percent. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude was up $1.42, or 2.8 percent, at $52.79 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, was up $1.44, or 2.7 percent, at $55.60 a barrel in London. BONDS: Bond prices fell.

Another crop of encouraging company earnings news helped lift the market, but investors were mostly focused on events in Washington as Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. The major stock indexes pulled back slightly as Trump delivered remarks after taking the oath of office. Among topics of particular interest to Wall Street, the speech touched on trade and the Trump administration’s intention of protecting the U.S. from “the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.” “The market is still embracing the Trump agenda, based on the market’s reaction to the speech,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. “Now the question the market has is, specifically, what does all of that mean in terms of trade?” The Dow rose 94.85 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,827.25.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Woolpert Opens Office in Historic Over-the-Rhine Neighborhood Woolpert Opens Office in Historic Over-the-Rhine Neighborhood Posted on January 20, 2017 by Top News US Full Feed in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer The national architecture, engineering and geospatial (AEG) firm’s Cincinnati office will focus on multidisciplinary projects and adaptive re-use, and extend its reach in commercial renovation, housing development, higher education, education, energy, government and aviation services. CINCINNATI, Ohio (PRWEB) January 20, 2017 Woolpert—a national architecture, engineering and geospatial (AEG) firm and the largest AEG firm headquartered in Ohio—has opened a new Cincinnati office in Over-the-Rhine (OTR), it was announced today. The office will be home to 20-plus full-time architects, engineers, surveyors and support staff, who will work in concert with the firm’s 700 networked employees in 23 offices across the country. OTR reflects the Cincinnati office’s intended focus of multidisciplinary projects and adaptive re-use, or bringing new life to once vacant or neglected buildings. The historic district has been undergoing a business and cultural renaissance over the last 15 years and has attracted many design and high-tech startup firms. “With Woolpert being a full-service architecture, MEP, structural, civil (engineering) and geospatial company, we excel at multidisciplinary, adaptive re-use projects,” Woolpert Vice President Mike Battles said. “We also are able to leverage these comprehensive services in-house, and back them up with the efficiency of our extensive geospatial/technology side. That combination of assets sets us apart, even in this dynamic setting.” Woolpert architect James Dobrozsi added that the firm’s “single source” and “single point of accessibility” for all site development and building projects enables the firm to respond to client needs from feasibility to completion. “Woolpert has been part of the development of Southwest Ohio for over 100 years,” Dobrozsi said. “To continue to be a viable force in the design community, it is critical for us to be in the heart of the revitalization in Cincinnati and the OTR community, which is one of the greatest collections of 19th- and early 20th-century architecture in the country.” Woolpert was founded in 1911 in Dayton, where its headquarters remain. The Greater Cincinnati Area was home to the firm’s first regional office branch, which opened in 1972. The firm continues to grow in the Cincinnati region and across the country. In the last two years, Woolpert experienced a 47 percent growth in sales and 12 percent rise in its workforce. In 2016, it was designated as a Great Place to Work, a national program that polls employees based on trust in company leadership, pride in what they do and enjoyment in the company of their co-workers. Woolpert’s new Cincinnati office, which was funded by the city of Cincinnati through the Job Creation Tax Credit program, will extend its commercial renovation and housing development, higher education, energy, government and aviation services. It also will build on long-standing relationships with local firms. Current Cincinnati clients, owners and business partners include the University of Cincinnati, Anderson Birkla, CVG, the city of Cincinnati, Koch Development, Procter & Gamble, Towne Properties, General Electric and Duke Energy. “We’ve always been in the business of new and adaptive re-use development in this region, and our brand has been in client development,” Battles said. “The (Jack) Cincinnati Casino is a perfect example of re-use, as is our Riverfront Commons development, work with Newport on the Levee, our conceptual design work with projects like AT580 and the Second National Bank Building in historic districts, stadiums, parking garages, U Square @ the Loop, CVG, Lunken Airport, (etc.)” Woolpert President and CEO Scott Cattran added that this move to a new Cincinnati location is in line the company’s mission to help employees and clients progress, and to move forward through forward thinking. “Our new Over-the-Rhine location reflects our progressive and innovative approach to architecture, engineering and geospatial services, and provides a hip new location for our talented employees who live in and around the Cincinnati community,” he said. Battles wanted to thank the city for bringing the firm downtown, and the Cincinnati Center City Development Corporation (3CDC) for its assistance in this relocation to OTR. Anthony Palazzolo, 3CDC commercial leasing officer, said 3CDC is happy to have an engineering, architecture and design firm like Woolpert not only move to OTR, but also share its address. Woolpert is on the second floor at 1203 Walnut St., while 3CDC is on the third and fourth floors. “With projects like 1201 Walnut and our upcoming 15th & Vine office building, we are starting to attract larger office tenants to the area, which continues to fuel the growth of Cincinnati's urban core,” Palazzolo said. “We're excited to welcome Woolpert to Over-the-Rhine.” Woolpert’s new Cincinnati office is now open for business.

Phone company stocks led the gainers. Energy stocks also rose as oil prices headed higher. Investors also had their eye on the latest batch of company earnings and outlooks.   FindTheCompany | Graphiq KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average rose 99 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,831 as of 11:07 a.m. Eastern Time. The Dow is coming off five straight losses and turned positive for the year again. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 10 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,274. The Nasdaq composite index added 21 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,561. THE QUOTE: An overall improvement in quarterly results so far this corporate earnings season as well as optimism over the Trump inauguration helped lift stocks, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. "Historically, the market has performed best in the November-April time frame," Stovall said. "The Trump victory added a tailwind to this traditional seasonal factor." TRUMP'S INAUGURATION: Investors will be looking for clues in Trump's midday inauguration speech about his plans on fiscal stimulus, tax cuts and trade. Expectations of lower taxes and less regulation on businesses gave stocks a boost for much of the last two months of 2016. But the possibility of increased tariffs or trade restrictions could mean drops in profits for big U.S. companies. Since 1953, starting with President Dwight D. Eisenhower's inauguration, the S&P 500 has risen an average of 1.6 percent in the first 100 days of a president's first term in office, Stovall noted. STRONG RESULTS: Skyworks Solutions jumped 12.4 percent after the semiconductor products maker reported better-than-anticipated quarterly results. The stock was the biggest gainer in the S&P 500, adding $9.72 to $88.18. BRIGHT OUTLOOK: Consumer goods maker Procter & Gamble rose 3.8 percent after releasing a strong growth forecast. The stock added $3.24 to $87.94. EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS: Citizens Financial Group gained 2.9 percent after reporting fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that beat analysts' expectations. The stock rose $1 to $35.73. BIG DECLINER: TransDigm Group was down the most among stocks in the S&P 500. It slumped $31.63, or 12.6 percent, to $220.13. MARKETS OVERSEAS: Germany's DAX rose 0.2 percent, while France's CAC 40 was 0.2 percent higher. Britain's FTSE 100 was down 0.1 percent. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 0.7 percent after the Chinese government said the economy grew at a 6.8 percent annual rate in the last quarter, even as full-year growth increased 6.7 percent, the weakest in three decades. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.3 percent. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude was up $1.42, or 2.8 percent, at $52.79 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, was up $1.44, or 2.7 percent, at $55.60 a barrel in London. BONDS: Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.49 percent from 2.47 percent late Thursday. Yields have been rising as investors expect inflation to increase. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 115.01 yen from Thursday's 114.80. The euro rose to $1.0680 from $1.0659.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) AP Stocks edge higher, snapping a 5-day losing streak for Dow By ALEX VEIGA AP Business Writer Jan 20, 2017 0 Richard Drew FILE - In this Friday, Nov. 13, 2015, file photo, the American flag flies above the Wall Street entrance to the New York Stock Exchange. Global shares were steady in cautious trading Friday, Jan. 20, 2017, ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. China's report that its economy grew at a 6.8 percent pace in October-December was in line with expectations. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Materials companies led U.S. stocks modestly higher Friday, recouping much of the market's loss from a day earlier and snapping a 5-day losing streak for the Dow Jones industrial average. Another crop of encouraging company earnings news helped lift the market, but investors were mostly focused on events in Washington as Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. The major stock indexes pulled back slightly as Trump delivered remarks after taking the oath of office. Among topics of particular interest to Wall Street, the speech touched on trade and the Trump administration's intention of protecting the U.S. from "the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs." "The market is still embracing the Trump agenda, based on the market's reaction to the speech," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "Now the question the market has is, specifically, what does all of that mean in terms of trade?" The Dow rose 94.85 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,827.25. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 7.62 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,271.31. The Nasdaq composite index added 15.25 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,555.33. Despite Friday's gains, the three major stock indexes ended the week lower. Stocks have slowed in 2017 after surging for several weeks following Election Day on investor optimism that a Trump administration and Republican Congress would usher in business-friendly policies. But the possibility of increased tariffs or trade restrictions has also loomed as a potential drag in profits for big U.S. companies. "Historically, the market has performed best in the November-April time frame," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. "The Trump victory added a tailwind to this traditional seasonal factor." Typically, stocks don't do well on inauguration day. Going back to 1928, the S&P has averaged a drop of 1.05 percent on inauguration days, according Bespoke Investment Group. Beyond the presidential transition in Washington, investors pored over the latest batch of corporate earnings Friday, bidding up shares in companies that reported results that beat Wall Street's expectations. Skyworks Solutions jumped 13 percent, the biggest gainer in the S&P 500. The stock climbed $10.21 to $88.67. Citizens Financial Group gained $1.09, or 3.1 percent, to $35.82. Traders also drove up shares in Procter & Gamble after the consumer goods maker released a strong growth forecast. The stock added $2.75, or 3.2 percent, to $87.45. Strong subscriber numbers helped lift AT&T, giving a boost to phone company stocks overall. AT&T added 45 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $41.45. Some companies' earnings failed to impress the market. General Electric slid 2.2 percent after the conglomerate reported fourth-quarter revenue that fell short of analysts' forecasts. The stock gave up 68 cents to $30.53. Investors sold off Bristol-Myers Squibb after the drugmaker said it won't pursue accelerated regulatory approval for a two-drug lung cancer treatment. The stock was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 index, shedding $6.26, or 11.3 percent, to $49.23. Major stock indexes overseas were mixed Friday. Germany's DAX rose 0.3 percent, while Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. France's CAC 40 added 0.2 percent. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 0.7 percent after the Chinese government said the economy grew at a 6.8 percent annual rate in the last quarter, even as full-year growth increased 6.7 percent, the weakest in three decades. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.3 percent. Benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.05, or 2 percent, to close at $52.42 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added $1.33, or 2.5 percent, to close at $55.49 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline gained 3 cents to $1.57 a gallon and heating oil rose 3 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas slid 16 cents, or 4.9 percent, to $3.20 per 1,000 cubic feet. Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 2.47 percent. Yields have been rising as investors expect inflation to increase.

Another crop of encouraging company earnings news helped lift the market, but investors were mostly focused on events in Washington as Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. The major stock indexes pulled back slightly as Trump delivered remarks after taking the oath of office. Among topics of particular interest to Wall Street, the speech touched on trade and the Trump administration's intention of protecting the U.S. from "the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs." "The market is still embracing the Trump agenda, based on the market's reaction to the speech," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "Now the question the market has is, specifically, what does all of that mean in terms of trade?" The Dow rose 94.85 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,827.25. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 7.62 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,271.31. The Nasdaq composite index added 15.25 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,555.33. Despite Friday's gains, the three major stock indexes ended the week lower. Stocks have slowed in 2017 after surging for several weeks following Election Day on investor optimism that a Trump administration and Republican Congress would usher in business-friendly policies. But the possibility of increased tariffs or trade restrictions has also loomed as a potential drag in profits for big U.S. companies. "Historically, the market has performed best in the November-April time frame," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. "The Trump victory added a tailwind to this traditional seasonal factor." Typically, stocks don't do well on inauguration day. Going back to 1928, the S&P has averaged a drop of 1.05 percent on inauguration days, according Bespoke Investment Group. Beyond the presidential transition in Washington, investors pored over the latest batch of corporate earnings Friday, bidding up shares in companies that reported results that beat Wall Street's expectations. Skyworks Solutions jumped 13 percent, the biggest gainer in the S&P 500. The stock climbed $10.21 to $88.67. Citizens Financial Group gained $1.09, or 3.1 percent, to $35.82. Traders also drove up shares in Procter & Gamble after the consumer goods maker released a strong growth forecast. The stock added $2.75, or 3.2 percent, to $87.45. Strong subscriber numbers helped lift AT&T, giving a boost to phone company stocks overall. AT&T added 45 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $41.45. Some companies' earnings failed to impress the market. General Electric slid 2.2 percent after the conglomerate reported fourth-quarter revenue that fell short of analysts' forecasts. The stock gave up 68 cents to $30.53. Investors sold off Bristol-Myers Squibb after the drugmaker said it won't pursue accelerated regulatory approval for a two-drug lung cancer treatment. The stock was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 index, shedding $6.26, or 11.3 percent, to $49.23. Major stock indexes overseas were mixed Friday. Germany's DAX rose 0.3 percent, while Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. France's CAC 40 added 0.2 percent. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 0.7 percent after the Chinese government said the economy grew at a 6.8 percent annual rate in the last quarter, even as full-year growth increased 6.7 percent, the weakest in three decades. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.3 percent. Benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.05, or 2 percent, to close at $52.42 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added $1.33, or 2.5 percent, to close at $55.49 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline gained 3 cents to $1.57 a gallon and heating oil rose 3 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas slid 16 cents, or 4.9 percent, to $3.20 per 1,000 cubic feet. Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 2.47 percent. Yields have been rising as investors expect inflation to increase.

Trump will be sworn in by U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts in Washington. Investors will focus on Trump's inaugural speech to get more insight into his economic policies. "There is a lot of optimism and renewed hope for better things to come," said Sean O'Hara, president of Pacer ETFs. "People view soon-to-be President Trump as a person who understands the way businesses work." Trump's campaign promises of tax and regulatory reforms and higher infrastructure spending had driven Wall Street to multiple highs post-election. However, the Trump trade had been unraveling in recent weeks as investors wait to see how he will carry out his ambitious plans. The S&P 500 has fallen by a median 2.7 percent in the month after each new president has taken the keys to the White House since Herbert Hoover did so in January 1929, according to a Reuters analysis. The dollar index slipped into negative territory, while a 2 percent rise in oil prices pushed up energy stocks. At 10:55 a.m. ET (1555 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 92.05 points, or 0.47 percent, at 19,824.45, and was on track to snap a five-day losing streak. The S&P 500 was up 10.04 points, or 0.44 percent, at 2,273.73 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 19.25 points, or 0.35 percent, at 5,559.33. Ten of the 11 major S&P indexes were higher, with technology giving the biggest bump to the broader index. Industrials, which have risen for the past two days, were down 0.2 percent. A thrush of quarterly earnings reports from Dow components also kept investors busy. Procter & Gamble was the top stock on the S&P and the Dow, rising 3.6 percent after the consumer products maker reported quarterly sales and profit above expectations. Merck rose 3.7 percent to $65.59 after Bristol-Myers said it would not seek accelerated U.S. approval for a combination of its two immunotherapy drugs as an initial treatment for lung cancer, giving Merck an advantage in the lucrative market. Bristol-Myers' stock was down 9.2 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,901 to 859. On the Nasdaq, 1,674 issues rose and 944 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 19 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 53 new highs and 20 new lows.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 20 January 2017 | MYT 11:34 PM Wall St gains across sectors ahead of Trump inauguration At 9:36am ET (Friday), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 109.18 points, or 0.55%, at 19,841.58. The Reuters photo shows a view of the floor at the New York Stock Exchange. NEW YORK: US stocks rose amid gains across sectors on Friday as investors counted down to Donald Trump’s inauguration as the 45th president of the United States. Trump, a New York businessman and former reality TV star, is scheduled to be sworn in around midday by US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts in Washington. Investors will focus on Trump’s inaugural speech to get more insight into his economic policies. “All eyes will be on the content and style of Trump’s inauguration speech,” Morgan Stanley strategists led by Hans Redeker wrote in a note. “The more ‘Presidential’ this speech comes across, the better the outcome for markets.” Trump’s campaign promises of tax and regulatory reforms and higher infrastructure spending had driven Wall Street to multiple highs post-election. However, the Trump trade has been unraveling in recent weeks as investors wait to see how he will carry out his ambitious plans. “I would expect an extremely calm day,” said Brad Lamensdorf, chief executive officer of Active Alts Inc. “Usually these type of events are highly publicized so people are very distracted during the day and I wouldn’t expect a lot of volatility.” The CBOE Volatility index, or Wall Street “fear gauge”, was down nearly 3%. The dollar index edged up for the third straight session, while a 2% rise in oil prices pushed up energy stocks. At 9:36am ET (1436 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 109.18 points, or 0.55%, at 19,841.58 and the S&P 500 was up 12.86 points, or 0.57%, at 2,276.55. The Nasdaq Composite was up 33.45 points, or 0.6%, at 5,573.53. Ten of the 11 major S&P indexes were higher, with technology giving the biggest bump to the broader index. Industrials, which have risen for the past two days, were flat. A thrush of quarterly earnings reports from Dow components also kept investors busy.  Procter & Gamble was the top stock on the S&P and the Dow, rising 2.7% after the consumer products maker reported quarterly sales and profit above expectations. General Electric was off 1.4% after the industrial conglomerate reported a drop in quarterly revenue. Merck rose 3.3% to US$62.35 after Bristol-Myers said it would not seek accelerated US approval for a combination of its two immunotherapy drugs as an initial treatment for lung cancer, giving Merck an advantage in the lucrative market. Bristol-Myers’ stock was down about 10%. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,890 to 670. On the Nasdaq, 1,520 issues rose and 685 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 11 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 20 new highs and five new lows. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Stocks , Wall Street Related Stories Wall Street slightly lower at open Dow holds above 20,000 at open Stocks up on reinvigorated Trump rally; Dow tops 20,000 Dow hits 20,000 as post-election rally resumes Wall Street edges higher as earnings gather pace You May Be Interested Wall St slips after soft GDP data, earnings Microsoft’s market value tops US$500bil again after 17 years Joey Yap: Good time to invest as assets are cheap Bring cheer to the underprivileged this festive season Go purple this CNY if you want to get lucky in love Six simple steps to feng shui your home Others Also Read Ponkan oranges choice of the season China turns to blockchain to make markets clearer and cleaner Ponkan oranges choice of the season Property Related advertisement Latest News Tycoon Slim says Trump not 'Terminator,' sees opportunities for Mexico In double whammy for Turkey, Fitch cuts to junk after S&P slashes outlook Fed to stop mortgage reinvestments in 2018 Wall St slips after soft GDP data, earnings Giving banks a run for their money Most Viewed in Business Making money from money Azman’s journey with AMMB Tycoon Slim says Trump not 'Terminator,' sees opportunities for Mexico Joey Yap: Good time to invest as assets are cheap What Dow hitting 20,000 points means to Malaysia In double whammy for Turkey, Fitch cuts to junk after S&P slashes outlook Unlocking value in MMC Giving banks a run for their money Fed to stop mortgage reinvestments in 2018 Wall St slips after soft GDP data, earnings advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Another crop of encouraging company earnings news helped lift the market, but investors were mostly focused on events in Washington as Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. The major stock indexes pulled back slightly as Trump delivered remarks after taking the oath of office. Among topics of particular interest to Wall Street, the speech touched on trade and the Trump administration's intention of protecting the U.S. from "the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs." "The market is still embracing the Trump agenda, based on the market's reaction to the speech," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "Now the question the market has is, specifically, what does all of that mean in terms of trade?" The Dow rose 94.85 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,827.25. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 7.62 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,271.31. The Nasdaq composite index added 15.25 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,555.33. Despite Friday's gains, the three major stock indexes ended the week lower. Stocks have slowed in 2017 after surging for several weeks following Election Day on investor optimism that a Trump administration and Republican Congress would usher in business-friendly policies. But the possibility of increased tariffs or trade restrictions has also loomed as a potential drag in profits for big U.S. companies. "Historically, the market has performed best in the November-April time frame," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. "The Trump victory added a tailwind to this traditional seasonal factor." Typically, stocks don't do well on inauguration day. Going back to 1928, the S&P has averaged a drop of 1.05 percent on inauguration days, according Bespoke Investment Group. Beyond the presidential transition in Washington, investors pored over the latest batch of corporate earnings Friday, bidding up shares in companies that reported results that beat Wall Street's expectations. Skyworks Solutions jumped 13 percent, the biggest gainer in the S&P 500. The stock climbed $10.21 to $88.67. Citizens Financial Group gained $1.09, or 3.1 percent, to $35.82. Traders also drove up shares in Procter & Gamble after the consumer goods maker released a strong growth forecast. The stock added $2.75, or 3.2 percent, to $87.45. Strong subscriber numbers helped lift AT&T, giving a boost to phone company stocks overall. AT&T added 45 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $41.45. Some companies' earnings failed to impress the market. General Electric slid 2.2 percent after the conglomerate reported fourth-quarter revenue that fell short of analysts' forecasts. The stock gave up 68 cents to $30.53. Investors sold off Bristol-Myers Squibb after the drugmaker said it won't pursue accelerated regulatory approval for a two-drug lung cancer treatment. The stock was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 index, shedding $6.26, or 11.3 percent, to $49.23. Major stock indexes overseas were mixed Friday. Germany's DAX rose 0.3 percent, while Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. France's CAC 40 added 0.2 percent. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 0.7 percent after the Chinese government said the economy grew at a 6.8 percent annual rate in the last quarter, even as full-year growth increased 6.7 percent, the weakest in three decades. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.3 percent. Benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.05, or 2 percent, to close at $52.42 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added $1.33, or 2.5 percent, to close at $55.49 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline gained 3 cents to $1.57 a gallon and heating oil rose 3 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas slid 16 cents, or 4.9 percent, to $3.20 per 1,000 cubic feet. Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 2.47 percent. Yields have been rising as investors expect inflation to increase. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 114.31 yen from Thursday's 114.80 yen. The euro rose to $1.0707 from $1.0659. The British pound edged up to $1.2378 from $1.2337. Gold dropped $3.40 to settle at $1,204.90 an ounce, while silver fell 3 cents to $17.03 an ounce. Copper slipped a penny to $2.63 a pound. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Trump will deliver his inauguration speech and investors will be keenly anticipating what he will say when he speaks to the nation as President for the first time. US stocks posted solid gains after Trump won the presidency election as investors bet that he would pursue massive corporate tax cuts, deregulation, and infrastructure spending. In corporate news, shares of the Procter & Gamble Co. jumped over two per cent in the early trading after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly results. Shares of American Express Co. fell about one per cent after the US bank posted quarterly earnings shy of forecasts but revenues above estimates. Shortly after the opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 96.83 points, or 0.49 per cent, to 19,829.23. The S&P 500 added 11.89 points, or 0.53 per cent, to 2,275.58. The Nasdaq Composite Index increased 30.16 points, or 0.54 per cent, to 5,570.24. On Thursday, US stocks reversed early gains to end lower, as investors digested a batch of economic data as well as the European Central Bank's decision to keep its interest rates unchanged. --IANS ahm/dg SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features In pictures: India's Republic Day Parade 2017 Tamil Nadu fights back on Jallikattu Jallikattu ban: Taming culture?

Phone company stocks led the gainers. Energy stocks also rose as oil prices headed higher. Investors also had their eye on the latest batch of company earnings and outlooks. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average rose 93 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,825 as of 10:07 a.m. Eastern Time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index gained 11 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,274. The Nasdaq composite index added 27 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,568. TRUMP’S INAUGURATION: Investors will be looking for clues in Trump’s midday inauguration speech about his plans on fiscal stimulus, tax cuts and trade. Expectations of lower taxes and less regulation on businesses gave stocks a boost for much of the last two months of 2016. But the possibility of increased tariffs or trade restrictions could mean drops in profits for big U.S. companies.

Another crop of encouraging company earnings news helped lift the market, but investors were mostly focused on events in Washington as Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. The major stock indexes pulled back slightly as Trump delivered remarks after taking the oath of office. Among topics of particular interest to Wall Street, the speech touched on trade and the Trump administration's intention of protecting the U.S. from "the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs." "The market is still embracing the Trump agenda, based on the market's reaction to the speech," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "Now the question the market has is, specifically, what does all of that mean in terms of trade?" FindTheCompany | Graphiq The Dow rose 94.85 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,827.25. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 7.62 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,271.31. The Nasdaq composite index added 15.25 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,555.33. Despite Friday's gains, the three major stock indexes ended the week lower. Stocks have slowed in 2017 after surging for several weeks following Election Day on investor optimism that a Trump administration and Republican Congress would usher in business-friendly policies. But the possibility of increased tariffs or trade restrictions has also loomed as a potential drag in profits for big U.S. companies. "Historically, the market has performed best in the November-April time frame," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. "The Trump victory added a tailwind to this traditional seasonal factor." Typically, stocks don't do well on inauguration day. Going back to 1928, the S&P has averaged a drop of 1.05 percent on inauguration days, according Bespoke Investment Group. Beyond the presidential transition in Washington, investors pored over the latest batch of corporate earnings Friday, bidding up shares in companies that reported results that beat Wall Street's expectations. Skyworks Solutions jumped 13 percent, the biggest gainer in the S&P 500. The stock climbed $10.21 to $88.67. Citizens Financial Group gained $1.09, or 3.1 percent, to $35.82. FindTheCompany | Graphiq Traders also drove up shares in Procter & Gamble after the consumer goods maker released a strong growth forecast. The stock added $2.75, or 3.2 percent, to $87.45. Strong subscriber numbers helped lift AT&T, giving a boost to phone company stocks overall. AT&T added 45 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $41.45. Some companies' earnings failed to impress the market. General Electric slid 2.2 percent after the conglomerate reported fourth-quarter revenue that fell short of analysts' forecasts. The stock gave up 68 cents to $30.53. Investors sold off Bristol-Myers Squibb after the drugmaker said it won't pursue accelerated regulatory approval for a two-drug lung cancer treatment. The stock was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 index, shedding $6.26, or 11.3 percent, to $49.23. Major stock indexes overseas were mixed Friday. Germany's DAX rose 0.3 percent, while Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. France's CAC 40 added 0.2 percent. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 0.7 percent after the Chinese government said the economy grew at a 6.8 percent annual rate in the last quarter, even as full-year growth increased 6.7 percent, the weakest in three decades.

Brent crude, used to price international oils, added $1.33, or 2.5 percent, to close at $55.49 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline gained 3 cents to $1.57 a gallon and heating oil rose 3 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas slid 16 cents, or 4.9 percent, to $3.20 per 1,000 cubic feet. Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 2.47 percent. Yields have been rising as investors expect inflation to increase.

Another crop of encouraging company earnings news helped lift the market, but investors were mostly focused on events in Washington as Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. The major stock indexes pulled back slightly as Trump delivered remarks after taking the oath of office. Among topics of particular interest to Wall Street, the speech touched on trade and the Trump administration's intention of protecting the U.S. from "the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs." "The market is still embracing the Trump agenda, based on the market's reaction to the speech," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "Now the question the market has is, specifically, what does all of that mean in terms of trade?" The Dow rose 94.85 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,827.25. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 7.62 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,271.31. The Nasdaq composite index added 15.25 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,555.33. Despite Friday's gains, the three major stock indexes ended the week lower. Stocks have slowed in 2017 after surging for several weeks following Election Day on investor optimism that a Trump administration and Republican Congress would usher in business-friendly policies. But the possibility of increased tariffs or trade restrictions has also loomed as a potential drag in profits for big U.S. companies. "Historically, the market has performed best in the November-April time frame," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. "The Trump victory added a tailwind to this traditional seasonal factor." Typically, stocks don't do well on inauguration day. Going back to 1928, the S&P has averaged a drop of 1.05 percent on inauguration days, according Bespoke Investment Group. Beyond the presidential transition in Washington, investors pored over the latest batch of corporate earnings Friday, bidding up shares in companies that reported results that beat Wall Street's expectations. Skyworks Solutions jumped 13 percent, the biggest gainer in the S&P 500. The stock climbed $10.21 to $88.67. Citizens Financial Group gained $1.09, or 3.1 percent, to $35.82. Traders also drove up shares in Procter & Gamble after the consumer goods maker released a strong growth forecast. The stock added $2.75, or 3.2 percent, to $87.45. Strong subscriber numbers helped lift AT&T, giving a boost to phone company stocks overall. AT&T added 45 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $41.45. Some companies' earnings failed to impress the market. General Electric slid 2.2 percent after the conglomerate reported fourth-quarter revenue that fell short of analysts' forecasts. The stock gave up 68 cents to $30.53. Investors sold off Bristol-Myers Squibb after the drugmaker said it won't pursue accelerated regulatory approval for a two-drug lung cancer treatment. The stock was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 index, shedding $6.26, or 11.3 percent, to $49.23. Major stock indexes overseas were mixed Friday. Germany's DAX rose 0.3 percent, while Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. France's CAC 40 added 0.2 percent. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 0.7 percent after the Chinese government said the economy grew at a 6.8 percent annual rate in the last quarter, even as full-year growth increased 6.7 percent, the weakest in three decades. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.3 percent. Benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.05, or 2 percent, to close at $52.42 a barrel in New York.

Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 2.47 percent. Yields have been rising as investors expect inflation to increase.

Global shares were steady in cautious trading Friday, Jan. 20, 2017, ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump.

TRUMP'S INAUGURATION: Investors will be looking for clues in Trump's midday inauguration speech about his plans on fiscal stimulus, tax cuts and trade.

Another crop of encouraging company earnings news helped lift the market, but investors were mostly focused on events in Washington as Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. The major stock indexes pulled back slightly as Trump delivered remarks after taking the oath of office. Among topics of particular interest to Wall Street, the speech touched on trade and the Trump administration’s intention of protecting the U.S. from “the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.” “The market is still embracing the Trump agenda, based on the market’s reaction to the speech,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. “Now the question the market has is, specifically, what does all of that mean in terms of trade?” The Dow rose 94.85 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,827.25. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index gained 7.62 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,271.31. The Nasdaq composite index added 15.25 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,555.33. Despite Friday’s gains, the three major stock indexes ended the week lower. Stocks have slowed in 2017 after surging for several weeks following Election Day on investor optimism that a Trump administration and Republican Congress would usher in business-friendly policies. But the possibility of increased tariffs or trade restrictions has also loomed as a potential drag in profits for big U.S. companies. “Historically, the market has performed best in the November-April time frame,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. “The Trump victory added a tailwind to this traditional seasonal factor.” Typically, stocks don’t do well on inauguration day. Going back to 1928, the S&P has averaged a drop of 1.05 percent on inauguration days, according Bespoke Investment Group. Beyond the presidential transition in Washington, investors pored over the latest batch of corporate earnings Friday, bidding up shares in companies that reported results that beat Wall Street’s expectations. Skyworks Solutions jumped 13 percent, the biggest gainer in the S&P 500. The stock climbed $10.21 to $88.67. Citizens Financial Group gained $1.09, or 3.1 percent, to $35.82. Traders also drove up shares in Procter & Gamble after the consumer goods maker released a strong growth forecast. The stock added $2.75, or 3.2 percent, to $87.45. Strong subscriber numbers helped lift AT&T, giving a boost to phone company stocks overall. AT&T added 45 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $41.45. Some companies’ earnings failed to impress the market. General Electric slid 2.2 percent after the conglomerate reported fourth-quarter revenue that fell short of analysts’ forecasts. The stock gave up 68 cents to $30.53. Investors sold off Bristol-Myers Squibb after the drugmaker said it won’t pursue accelerated regulatory approval for a two-drug lung cancer treatment. The stock was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 index, shedding $6.26, or 11.3 percent, to $49.23. Major stock indexes overseas were mixed Friday. Germany’s DAX rose 0.3 percent, while Britain’s FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. France’s CAC 40 added 0.2 percent. In Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng shed 0.7 percent after the Chinese government said the economy grew at a 6.8 percent annual rate in the last quarter, even as full-year growth increased 6.7 percent, the weakest in three decades. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index rose 0.3 percent. Benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.05, or 2 percent, to close at $52.42 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added $1.33, or 2.5 percent, to close at $55.49 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline gained 3 cents to $1.57 a gallon and heating oil rose 3 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas slid 16 cents, or 4.9 percent, to $3.20 per 1,000 cubic feet. Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 2.47 percent. Yields have been rising as investors expect inflation to increase. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 114.31 yen from Thursday’s 114.80 yen. The euro rose to $1.0707 from $1.0659. The British pound edged up to $1.2378 from $1.2337. Gold dropped $3.40 to settle at $1,204.90 an ounce, while silver fell 3 cents to $17.03 an ounce. Copper slipped a penny to $2.63 a pound.

Posted 20 Jan 2017 21:00 Updated 21 Jan 2017 06:35 A trader watches the Trump inauguration on TV on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., January 20, 2017. REUTERS/Stephen Yang Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: U.S. stocks closed higher on Friday in a modest but broad-based advance as Donald Trump was sworn in as U.S. President, marking the first time in more than 50 years that a new commander-in-chief has been welcomed by a rising equity market on his first day in office. In his speech, Trump said U.S. policy will be to buy American and hire American, reiterating what he had said many times during this campaign for the White House. Some investors said the comments reinforced concerns about potential protectionist trade policies. Indexes pared gains during his speech and ended off the highest levels of the day. However, the rally in stocks since the Nov. 8 election had stalled in recent weeks as investors awaited clarity on his plans to boost the economy. All three major indexes ended with losses for the week. "We're now trading off of reality rather than hope, and it's natural to be a bit more cautious when we make that transition," said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. The S&P 500's 6.2-percent gain since the election is one of the best performances for the American stock market for any presidential transition period of the modern era. Former President Barack Obama's transition period, which came amid the throes of the 2008 financial crisis, overlapped a 15.5 percent fall for the S&P 500 from his election to the day of his 2009 inauguration. Yet he presided over the second-best run for the stock market under any president since Dwight Eisenhower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average snapped a five-session losing streak, closing up 94.85 points, or 0.48 percent, to 19,827.25. The S&P 500 gained 7.62 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,271.31 and the Nasdaq Composite added 15.25 points, or 0.28 percent, to 5,555.33. The last time when either the S&P or Dow rose on the day a new president was inaugurated was Jan. 20, 1961, when John F. Kennedy was sworn in to succeed Eisenhower. The S&P gained 0.32 percent and the Dow added 0.31 percent; the Nasdaq did not yet exist. The first day aside, the coming month might not be as rosy. The S&P 500 has fallen by a median 2.7 percent in the month after each new president has taken the keys to the White House since Herbert Hoover in January 1929, according to a Reuters analysis. Trump also loomed on the earnings front. Shares of Kansas City Southern rose 4 percent even as it reported a lower quarterly net profit that missed Wall Street estimates. A historic drop in the Mexican peso after Trump's election affected the regional U.S. railroad's operations in Mexico. Among other gainers, Merck rose 3.6 percent to US$62.53 after Bristol-Myers said it would not seek accelerated U.S. approval for a combination of its two immunotherapy drugs as an initial treatment for lung cancer, giving Merck an advantage in the lucrative market. Bristol-Myers' stock fell 11.3 percent. About 6.6 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, higher than the 6.1 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Another crop of encouraging company earnings news helped lift the market, but investors were mostly focused on events in Washington as Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. The major stock indexes pulled back slightly as Trump delivered remarks after taking the oath of office. Among topics of particular interest to Wall Street, the speech touched on trade and the Trump administration's intention of protecting the U.S. from "the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs." FILE - In this Friday, Nov. 13, 2015, file photo, the American flag flies above the Wall Street entrance to the New York Stock Exchange. Global shares were steady in cautious trading Friday, Jan. 20, 2017, ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. China's report that its economy grew at a 6.8 percent pace in October-December was in line with expectations. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) "The market is still embracing the Trump agenda, based on the market's reaction to the speech," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "Now the question the market has is, specifically, what does all of that mean in terms of trade?" The Dow rose 94.85 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,827.25. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 7.62 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,271.31. The Nasdaq composite index added 15.25 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,555.33. Despite Friday's gains, the three major stock indexes ended the week lower. Stocks have slowed in 2017 after surging for several weeks following Election Day on investor optimism that a Trump administration and Republican Congress would usher in business-friendly policies. But the possibility of increased tariffs or trade restrictions has also loomed as a potential drag in profits for big U.S. companies. "Historically, the market has performed best in the November-April time frame," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. "The Trump victory added a tailwind to this traditional seasonal factor." Typically, stocks don't do well on inauguration day. Going back to 1928, the S&P has averaged a drop of 1.05 percent on inauguration days, according Bespoke Investment Group. Beyond the presidential transition in Washington, investors pored over the latest batch of corporate earnings Friday, bidding up shares in companies that reported results that beat Wall Street's expectations. Skyworks Solutions jumped 13 percent, the biggest gainer in the S&P 500. The stock climbed $10.21 to $88.67. Citizens Financial Group gained $1.09, or 3.1 percent, to $35.82. Traders also drove up shares in Procter & Gamble after the consumer goods maker released a strong growth forecast. The stock added $2.75, or 3.2 percent, to $87.45. Strong subscriber numbers helped lift AT&T, giving a boost to phone company stocks overall. AT&T added 45 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $41.45. Some companies' earnings failed to impress the market. General Electric slid 2.2 percent after the conglomerate reported fourth-quarter revenue that fell short of analysts' forecasts. The stock gave up 68 cents to $30.53. Investors sold off Bristol-Myers Squibb after the drugmaker said it won't pursue accelerated regulatory approval for a two-drug lung cancer treatment. The stock was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 index, shedding $6.26, or 11.3 percent, to $49.23. Major stock indexes overseas were mixed Friday. Germany's DAX rose 0.3 percent, while Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. France's CAC 40 added 0.2 percent. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 0.7 percent after the Chinese government said the economy grew at a 6.8 percent annual rate in the last quarter, even as full-year growth increased 6.7 percent, the weakest in three decades. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.3 percent. Benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.05, or 2 percent, to close at $52.42 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added $1.33, or 2.5 percent, to close at $55.49 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline gained 3 cents to $1.57 a gallon and heating oil rose 3 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas slid 16 cents, or 4.9 percent, to $3.20 per 1,000 cubic feet. Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 2.47 percent. Yields have been rising as investors expect inflation to increase. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 114.31 yen from Thursday's 114.80 yen. The euro rose to $1.0707 from $1.0659. The British pound edged up to $1.2378 from $1.2337. Gold dropped $3.40 to settle at $1,204.90 an ounce, while silver fell 3 cents to $17.03 an ounce. Copper slipped a penny to $2.63 a pound.

Another crop of encouraging company earnings news helped lift the market, but investors were mostly focused on events in Washington as Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. The major stock indexes pulled back slightly as Trump delivered remarks after taking the oath of office. Among topics of particular interest to Wall Street, the speech touched on trade and the Trump administration’s intention of protecting the U.S. from “the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.” “The market is still embracing the Trump agenda, based on the market’s reaction to the speech,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. “Now the question the market has is, specifically, what does all of that mean in terms of trade?” The Dow rose 94.85 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,827.25. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index gained 7.62 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,271.31. The Nasdaq composite index added 15.25 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,555.33. Despite Friday’s gains, the three major stock indexes ended the week lower. Stocks have slowed in 2017 after surging for several weeks following Election Day on investor optimism that a Trump administration and Republican Congress would usher in business-friendly policies. But the possibility of increased tariffs or trade restrictions has also loomed as a potential drag in profits for big U.S. companies. “Historically, the market has performed best in the November-April time frame,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. “The Trump victory added a tailwind to this traditional seasonal factor.” Typically, stocks don’t do well on inauguration day. Going back to 1928, the S&P has averaged a drop of 1.05 percent on inauguration days, according Bespoke Investment Group. Beyond the presidential transition in Washington, investors pored over the latest batch of corporate earnings Friday, bidding up shares in companies that reported results that beat Wall Street’s expectations. Skyworks Solutions jumped 13 percent, the biggest gainer in the S&P 500. The stock climbed $10.21 to $88.67. Citizens Financial Group gained $1.09, or 3.1 percent, to $35.82. Traders also drove up shares in Procter & Gamble after the consumer goods maker released a strong growth forecast. The stock added $2.75, or 3.2 percent, to $87.45. Strong subscriber numbers helped lift AT&T, giving a boost to phone company stocks overall. AT&T added 45 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $41.45. Some companies’ earnings failed to impress the market. General Electric slid 2.2 percent after the conglomerate reported fourth-quarter revenue that fell short of analysts’ forecasts. The stock gave up 68 cents to $30.53. Investors sold off Bristol-Myers Squibb after the drugmaker said it won’t pursue accelerated regulatory approval for a two-drug lung cancer treatment. The stock was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 index, shedding $6.26, or 11.3 percent, to $49.23. Major stock indexes overseas were mixed Friday. Germany’s DAX rose 0.3 percent, while Britain’s FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. France’s CAC 40 added 0.2 percent. In Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng shed 0.7 percent after the Chinese government said the economy grew at a 6.8 percent annual rate in the last quarter, even as full-year growth increased 6.7 percent, the weakest in three decades. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index rose 0.3 percent. Benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.05, or 2 percent, to close at $52.42 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added $1.33, or 2.5 percent, to close at $55.49 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline gained 3 cents to $1.57 a gallon and heating oil rose 3 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas slid 16 cents, or 4.9 percent, to $3.20 per 1,000 cubic feet. Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 2.47 percent. Yields have been rising as investors expect inflation to increase. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 114.31 yen from Thursday’s 114.80 yen. The euro rose to $1.0707 from $1.0659. The British pound edged up to $1.2378 from $1.2337. Gold dropped $3.40 to settle at $1,204.90 an ounce, while silver fell 3 cents to $17.03 an ounce. Copper slipped a penny to $2.63 a pound.

"Following" : "Follow"}} January 20, 2017 10:00am   Comments Share: There’s really only one major story in the markets today: The inauguration of a new U.S. president. With no major economic data on tap, the inauguration of Donald Trump is likely to draw everyone’s full attention. Though an inaugural speech is generally short and not often full of specific policy ideas, it’s worth listening to get a sense of any economic moves the new administration might make. And speaking of those, there’s possibly going to be some executive orders going out not long after Trump moves into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, media outlets reported. The question is whether any of those orders might have an impact on stocks and bonds. Equities exhibited weakness ahead of last fall’s election, and the same thing has happened going into today’s inauguration. On Thursday, the S&P 500 Index (SPX) posted its lowest close in more than two weeks, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) logged its fifth-straight down day. Real estate and energy were among the worst sector performers. As was the case before the election, there haven’t been any major plunges during this stretch, just a general feeling of lethargy. There’s a sense that the markets had a great run in the month after the election amid good feelings about what the new administration might do, and now people are waiting to see exactly how the incoming president might bring such changes about. Sectors that could see a quick impact from new policies include info tech, energy, industrial, materials, health care and any sector or company with a major foothold overseas. While there’s optimism about the possibility of lower taxes, reduced regulations, and infrastructure spending, there’s also concern about possible trade barriers, how the new administration plans to handle health care, and the continued Trump tweets that have often been aimed at individual companies. Trump pledges to continue tweeting once in office. Volatility, as measured by VIX, has been on the upswing the last two days, perhaps reflecting some nervousness about how the new administration might affect the market after a long quiet period starting back before the holidays. This week, Trump's tweet about the dollar being too strong helped push the U.S. currency down and struck fear into some foreign equity markets. However, the dollar has since risen, helped in part by strong economic data the last few days and an upbeat speech on the economy by Fed Chair Janet Yellen. Her speech, in which Yellen reiterated the Fed’s plans to hike rates this year and next, also lit a fire under bond yields, with the 10-year yield making a big advance Thursday and reaching 2.5% early Friday. Trump takes office right in the middle of the earnings season, and the big banks generally did well. The financial sector, however, was one of the worst performers on Thursday. Earnings attention now turns to some of the biggest companies around, including International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) yesterday (see below), General Electric Company (NYSE: GE) today, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD) on Monday morning, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) on Tuesday morning, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) after Tuesday’s close. It’s a busy start to the week. GE reported earnings that were in line with Wall Street analyst’s expectations, but revenue that came up just short of estimates. The stock fell in pre-market trading. Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG) also reported strong earnings and a good outlook. It’s nice to see a healthy outlook from them. Overseas, China reported year-over-year GDP growth of 6.8%, a one-year high. That was despite weaker-than-expected Industrial Production in December. The dollar rose vs. the euro. Gold may be on track for its fourth consecutive weekly gain, which may reflect something of a fear trade as people hedge ahead of the inauguration. Gold has been in a tight range, so perhaps market participants feel there’s a little less downside if their bets go against them. VIX fell a bit early Friday. Though stocks have been flat to lower recently, they remain solidly higher than they were on election day. The DJIA is up 7.6% since Nov. 8; the SPX is up 5.8%, and the Nasdaq is up 6.7% over the same period. Reading the Beige Book The Fed’s Beige Book this week reported that the economy continued to expand at a “modest pace” from late November through the end of last year. Labor markets were “tight or tightening” during the period, wages increased “modestly” and pricing pressures “intensified somewhat since the last report,” the Fed said. These conditions, along with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 2.1% year-over-year, the highest since mid-2014, all seem to play into the Fed’s interest rate hike strategy. The Fed has indicated three hikes are likely in 2017, but the futures market doesn’t point toward any until mid-year. All Quiet in Washington Today Looking beyond one particular event at the U.S. Capitol this morning, Washington appears rather dull from a government data standpoint. No major reports are scheduled today or Monday. Looking back to Thursday, housing starts for December at a seasonally adjusted 1.226 million came in a hair above analysts’ estimates for 1.2 million. This particular indicator continues to creep higher. However, the gains were all in multi-family housing units, with single-family housing starts actually falling during December. Single-family permits, however, rose 4%, and could be seen as a positive forward indicator, Briefing.com said. Strong IBM Earnings But Shares Fall IBM reported earnings 13 cents above Wall Street analysts’ consensus late Thursday, and also beat estimates on revenue and raised guidance. In its press release, the company touted progress in its closely watched cloud products. Revenue in IBM’s Strategic Imperatives, which includes cloud computing, rose 13% in Q4. But shares fell, perhaps, according to Forbes, because revenue dropped for the 19th-consecutive quarter.

Trump, a New York businessman and former reality TV star, is scheduled to be sworn in around midday by U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts in Washington. Investors will focus on Trump's inaugural speech to get more insight into his economic policies. "All eyes will be on the content and style of Trump's inauguration speech," Morgan Stanley strategists led by Hans Redeker wrote in a note. "The more 'Presidential' this speech comes across, the better the outcome for markets." Trump's campaign promises of tax and regulatory reforms and higher infrastructure spending had driven Wall Street to multiple highs post-election. However, the Trump trade has been unraveling in recent weeks as investors wait to see how he will carry out his ambitious plans. "I would expect an extremely calm day," said Brad Lamensdorf, chief executive officer of Active Alts Inc. "Usually these type of events are highly publicized so people are very distracted during the day and I wouldn't expect a lot of volatility." The CBOE Volatility index, or Wall Street "fear gauge", was down nearly 3 percent. The dollar index edged up for the third straight session, while a 2 percent rise in oil prices pushed up energy stocks. At 9:36 a.m. ET (1436 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 109.18 points, or 0.55 percent, at 19,841.58 and the S&P 500 was up 12.86 points, or 0.57 percent, at 2,276.55. The Nasdaq Composite was up 33.45 points, or 0.6 percent, at 5,573.53. Ten of the 11 major S&P indexes were higher, with technology giving the biggest bump to the broader index. Industrials, which have risen for the past two days, were flat. A thrush of quarterly earnings reports from Dow components also kept investors busy. Procter & Gamble was the top stock on the S&P and the Dow, rising 2.7 percent after the consumer products maker reported quarterly sales and profit above expectations. General Electric was off 1.4 percent after the industrial conglomerate reported a drop in quarterly revenue. Merck rose 3.3 percent to $62.35 after Bristol-Myers said it would not seek accelerated U.S. approval for a combination of its two immunotherapy drugs as an initial treatment for lung cancer, giving Merck an advantage in the lucrative market. Bristol-Myers' stock was down about 10 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,890 to 670. On the Nasdaq, 1,520 issues rose and 685 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 11 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 20 new highs and five new lows.

Business leaders gathered at the annual World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos warned this week that the collateral damage to jobs needs to be addressed more seriously. From taxi drivers to healthcare professionals more and more jobs are at risk, down to technologies including robotics, driverless cars, artificial intelligence and 3-D printing. Equipment to sort recycled plastic is shown at the Repreve Bottle Processing Center, part of the Unifi textile company in Reidsville, N.C. Experts have warned that machines are to be blamed for job losses over the past decade Adidas, for example, aims to use 3-D printing in the manufacture of some running shoes. 'Jobs will be lost, jobs will evolve and this revolution is going to be ageless, it's going to be classless and it's going to affect everyone,' said Meg Whitman, chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. While some supporters of Donald Trump and Brexit may hope new government policies will bring lost jobs back to America's Rust Belt or Britain's industrial north, economists estimate 86 percent of U.S. manufacturing job losses are actually down to productivity, according to the WEF's annual risks report. A Just Eat Robot makes a delivery on the streets of Greenwich, London. The company is planning to use robots to replace delivery drivers 'Technology is the big issue and we don't acknowledge that,' Mark Weinberger, chairman of consultancy EY, said yesterday, arguing there was a tendency to always blame trading partners. The political backdrop is prompting CEOs to take the challenge of long-life training of workforces more seriously, in order to keep up with the exponential growth of technological advances. 'I think what we're reaching now is a time when we may have to find alternative careers through our lifetime,' Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella told Reuters. Over the last decade, more jobs have been lost to technology than any other factor, and John Drzik, head of global risk at insurance broker Marsh, expects more of the same.  It has been estimated that robots will shrink labour costs by 22 percent in the United States, 25 percent in Japan and 33 percent in South Korea 'That is going to raise challenges, particularly given the political context,' Drzik, who helped compile the WEF report, said. Compared to clamping down on immigration by tightening borders, dealing with the impact of technology destroying jobs is something that is perhaps even less easily controlled, experts warned. For while many advanced technologies remain more expensive than low or medium-skilled labour in the near term, the shift is likely to accelerate as costs come down.  Technological advancements require governments, businesses and academic institutions to develop more educated and highly skilled workforces, executives in Davos said. Research shows that the automation of U.S. factories is a much bigger factor than foreign trade in the loss of factory jobs But this shift to skilled workers also widens the income gap and fuels growing inequality. Jonas Prising, CEO of staffing firm ManpowerGroup, said that U.S. unemployment is only about 2 to 2.5 percent among college-educated people but 9 or 10 percent among those with low or no skills. 'The idea that we would ban automation as part of an evolution within the manufacturing industry, is not really part of the discussion,' Prising said.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Sex between husbands and wives will only be for 'special...

FIVE JOBS MOST AT RISK  A study last year revealed the five jobs most at risk of automation. These are: Accountants are 99 per cent likely to lose their jobs to machines. Umpires and referees have a 98.3 per cent chance of being automated. Waiters and waitress are 93.7 per cent likely to be replaced by machines. Legal assistants and paralegals have a 94.5 per cent chance of being automated. Fashion models are 97.6 per cent likely to lose the lime light because of robots.  'If we don't own responsibility (for the problem of displaced workers), it's only going to get bigger,' Procter & Gamble Chief Executive David Taylor said.  The scope of the employment risk from what the WEF calls the 'fourth industrial revolution' which 'blurs the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres' is unclear. A University of Oxford study in 2013 said nearly half of U.S. jobs were at risk, while in 2015 Forrester Research predicted a net loss of only 7 percent by 2025, as some lost jobs will be replaced with new ones. Forrester predicts that by 2019, one-quarter of all job tasks will be offloaded to software robots, physical robots, or customer self-service automation. Even the corner office may not be safe. 'CEOs feel reasonably confident we are not going to be replaced by artificial intelligence,' Inga Beale, CEO of the Lloyd's of London insurance market, said. 'But I'm sure there will be a time!' WORKPLACE ACTIVITIES WITH HIGH POTENTIAL FOR AUTOMATION In a recent McKinsey report, researchers analysed more than 2,000 work activities for over 800 occupations, looking at the amount of time spent on particular activities, and the feasibility of automating these tasks.  For jobs which involve performing predictable physical activities, the researchers say the feasibility of automation is roughly 78 percent.  The findings include: 59 percent of manufacturing activities could be automated. Within this field, the researchers say 90 percent of the activities of welders, cutters, solderers and brazers could be done by a robot. 73 percent of activities in food service and accommodations could be automated 53 percent of retail work could be automated; 47 percent of the salesperson’s job could be automated, while 86 percent of bookkeepers, accountant and auditing clerks has this potential For jobs which involve performing predictable physical activities, the researchers say the feasibility of automation is roughly 78 percent. But, this is not the only factor to be considered when determining which jobs could soon be taken over by robots They also detailed the activities with low potential for automation: Education Healthcare, especially those which require expertise and direct contact with patients, like dental hygienist 'Knowledge work,' including management jobs    Share or comment on this article e-mail 18 shares Most watched News videos Pizza Hut customer finds workers in the back of empty restaurant in Bristol Graphic: NZ Breakers player's eye dislodged in horrific injury Shocking CCTV shows car speed into Humber Bridge barrier Heartwarming scene as Grayce shares her puppies with owner 'There goes that relationship' Trump's quip to BBC question Florida couple passed out in their car with two children in the backseat A close look at the huge crack formed across Arizona desert Enraged man punches laptop and quits job during 'meltdown' at airport Alarming moment guy violently pushes man onto tube tracks Bizarre footage of multiple UFOs hovering near Mexican border CCTV shows brave man fighting nunchuck-wielding robbers Inauguration etiquette 101: Escort First Lady up White House steps Settling in nicely!

First, it’s in the right sector. Consumer spending has been increasing over the past couple months and consumer sentiment is rising. Consumer psychology is an important factor in whether there is economic growth. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, consumer spending in the U.S. generates about 70% of the country’s GDP. That means, we live in a consumer-generated economy. You may have thought the government or the big financial institutions controlled the means to powering the U.S. economy, but it’s really up to you and me. And at this point, we’re doing a pretty good job, at least relative to where we’ve been. The surge in consumer spending, however, hasn’t resulted in a run on big-ticket items, rather it’s the smaller stuff we buy every week. And that is why it’s little surprise the kind of companies that make up VDC’s top five: Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG), The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo Inc (NYSE:PEP), Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) and Altria Group Inc (NYSE:MO). One thing that stands out here is the fact that most of these companies are dividend aristocrats, raising their dividends every year for more than 25 years. Their dividends demonstrate that these firms are very successful and very shareholder friendly. They’ve also been around long enough to have seen their share of difficult days and come out stronger every time. And since we’re talking about dividends, that brings me to point No. 2. VDC is handing out a very respectable, near-3% dividend. This is a factor in the ETF’s total return, meaning that we’re looking at a minimum return of 3% just for holding VDC. That’s a pretty good head start. And it’s the highest dividend given out by the top consumer staples exchange-traded funds. But the dividend also is a factor in point No. 3. You see, Vanguard is known for its consistently low fees.

Inauguration day: Donald Trump is set to be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States on Friday. Trump will take the oath of office around noon.

The S&P 500 jumped 5.8% while the Nasdaq added 6.7% over the same period. But the Republican has also introduced a heavy dose of uncertainty to markets. Trump has made a habit of targeting and calling out specific companies on Twitter. He's criticized Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), United Technologies (UTX), GM (GM) and Ford (F) -- as well as foreign car companies Toyota (TM) and BMW (BMWYY).

Image by: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Open markets and global trade have been blamed for job losses over the last decade, but global CEOs say the real culprits are increasingly machines. Save & Share Tweet Email Print And while business leaders gathered at the annual World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos relish the productivity gains technology can bring, they warned this week that the collateral damage to jobs needs to be addressed more seriously. From taxi drivers to healthcare professionals, technologies such as robotics, driverless cars, artificial intelligence and 3-D printing mean more and more types of jobs are at risk. Adidas, for example, aims to use 3-D printing in the manufacture of some running shoes. "Jobs will be lost, jobs will evolve and this revolution is going to be ageless, it's going to be classless and it's going to affect everyone," said Meg Whitman, chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. So while some supporters of Donald Trump and Brexit may hope new government policies will bring lost jobs back to America's Rust Belt or Britain's industrial north, economists estimate 86 percent of U.S. manufacturing job losses are actually down to productivity, according to the WEF's annual risks report. "Technology is the big issue and we don't acknowledge that," Mark Weinberger, chairman of consultancy EY, said on Thursday, arguing there was a tendency to always blame trading partners. The political backdrop is prompting CEOs to take more seriously the challenge of long-life training of workforces to keep up with the exponential growth of technological advances. "I think what we're reaching now is a time when we may have to find alternative careers through our lifetime," Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella told Reuters. Over the last decade, more jobs have been lost to technology than any other factor, and John Drzik, head of global risk at insurance broker Marsh, expects more of the same. "That is going to raise challenges, particularly given the political context," Drzik, who helped compile the WEF report, said. Compared to clamping down on immigration by tightening borders, dealing with the impact of technology destroying jobs is something that is perhaps even less easily controlled. For while many advanced technologies remain more expensive than low- or medium-skilled labour in the near term, the shift is likely to accelerate as costs come down. WIDENING GAP Technological advancements require governments, businesses and academic institutions to develop more educated and highly skilled workforces, executives in Davos said. But this shift to skilled workers also widens the income gap and fuels growing inequality. Jonas Prising, CEO of staffing firm ManpowerGroup, noted that U.S. unemployment is only about 2 to 2.5 percent among college-educated people but 9 or 10 percent among those with low or no skills. "The idea that we would ban automation as part of an evolution within the manufacturing industry, is not really part of the discussion," Prising said. He pointed to policies in countries like Denmark and Italy, where there is a focus on employability of workers. "If we don't own responsibility (for the problem of displaced workers), it's only going to get bigger," Procter & Gamble Chief Executive David Taylor said. BRAWN AND BRAIN The scope of the employment risk from what the WEF calls the "fourth industrial revolution" which "blurs the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres" is unclear. A University of Oxford study in 2013 said nearly half of U.S. jobs were at risk, while in 2015 Forrester Research predicted a net loss of only 7 percent by 2025, as some lost jobs will be replaced with new ones. Forrester predicts that by 2019, one-quarter of all job tasks will be offloaded to software robots, physical robots, or customer self-service automation. Even the corner office may not be safe. "CEOs feel reasonably confident we are not going to be replaced by artificial intelligence," Inga Beale, CEO of the Lloyd's of London insurance market, said. "But I'm sure there will be a time!"

Albany, NY, January 20, 2017 --(PR.com)-- In the recent years, improving technology and emerging hair products have provided a lot of exposure to the hair care industry. According to a new study added to the vast portfolio of Market Research Hub (MRH), The United States of America represents the largest market for hair care products under the personal and beauty care segment. This study is entitled as “Consumer and Market Insights: Haircare Market in the U.S.” which provides insights on high growth categories of hair care to target trends in the usage of packaging materials, types and category level distribution data & brands market shares. According to the key findings, the U.S. haircare market is forecasted to exhibit a CAGR of 0.7% during the years 2015-2020. Request for Sample Report: http://www.marketresearchhub.com/enquiry.php?type=S&repid=915197 It is well known that hair care products help to protect and nourish the hair and reduce damage. Also, tedious and tiring life, as well as the harmful elements in the environment, leads to dull and damaged hair. Thus, to overcome this issue, now hair care products are used by hair care professionals in salons and also by an individual at home. It has also been observed by the study that rising consumption of hair care products, especially among the youth, and the consumer’s recent increase in fashion consciousness will boost the market in the U.S. during the forecasted period. Additionally, factors like the early adoption of hair dyes and the increased usage of hair colors by the public in the U.S. region will raise the prospects for growth in this market until 2020. According to the type of hair and its requirements, there are different categories of hair care products available in the market such as shampoo, conditioner, hair styling gels, hair loss treatments, colorants, serums, hair spray, glazes and hair accessories which are precisely covered in the study. Among these, wide adoption of shampoo as a hair care item in the U.S. resulted in the growth of this segment. On the other hand, salon hair care is estimated to witness the rapid value growth during the forecast period of 2015-2020. In this subsequent section, distribution data coverage including the percentage of sales within each category through distribution channels such as convenience stores, Hypermarkets & Supermarkets, Health & Beauty Stores, department stores, drug stores & pharmacies etc. are also provided. Amongst, Hypermarkets & Supermarkets accounted for the uppermost distribution share in the U.S. Haircare market.

Crude oil futures extended overnight gains, brushing off a surprise build in U.S. crude inventories last week, while the dollar was mixed against its major rivals. In remarks to the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research in California, Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Thursday said that she considers it prudent to adjust the stance of monetary policy gradually over time. On the other hand, ECB President Mario Draghi acknowledged that the growth outlook for the euro area has improved but there are ample risks related predominantly to global factors. Asian stocks are mostly lower even as a slew of data out China provided further evidence of stabilizing growth. China's GDP grew an annual 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter, slightly beating expectations. Retail sales figures for December came in slightly above forecasts while industrial production and fixed-asset investment grew at a slower but still solid pace in the month. German PPI and U.K. retail sales data for December as well as U.S. Baker Hughes rig count figures are slated for release later in the day. U.S. stock futures are turning in a mixed performance after American Express posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit and IBM reported another decline in quarterly revenue. General Electric and Procter & Gamble are among the companies due to report their results before the opening bell. U.S. stocks finished lower overnight despite encouraging data on jobless claims, housing starts and regional manufacturing activity. The Dow dropped 0.4 percent to extend losses for the fifth consecutive session and hit its lowest level in over a month. The tech-heavy Nasdaq slid 0.3 percent and the S&P 500 shed 0.4 percent. European stocks also closed slightly lower on Thursday after ECB Chief Mario Draghi struck a dovish tone on inflation and reiterated the central bank stands ready to increase the size and duration of its bond-buying program if necessary. The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index and the German DAX finished marginally lower, while France's CAC 40 index slid 0.3 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 shed half a percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News The World's 10 Most Productive Nations, Ranked Biotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In February In Memorium: Business Giants We Lost In 2016 More Top Stories Trump Signs Order Instituting "Extreme Vetting" Of Immigrants Stocks Close Roughly Flat For Second Straight Day - U.S. Commentary Abercrombie & Fitch Issues 150 Pink Slips Trump Discusses Mexico, Russia, Brexit In News Conference With May Trump To Speak With Putin By Phone On Saturday Feds Claim Breathometer Made False Claims About Accuracy Trump Expresses Support For "Nuclear Option" Over Supreme Court Nominee Stocks Continue To Lack Direction In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary Stocks Continue To Experience Choppy Trading - U.S. Commentary Report: Wet Seal Will Go Extinct Trump Accuses Mexico Of Taking Advantage Of U.S. Study Shows How Jet Lag Affects Baseball Teams McDonald's Sells All Of Its Nordic Restaurants U.S. Consumer Sentiment Reaches Thirteen-Year High In January Tim Hortons Coming To Mexico <<Previous        103 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed McDonald's Sells All Of Its Nordic Restaurants Tim Hortons Coming To Mexico Chevron Turns To Profit In Q4, But Results Miss Estimates Air Products Sees Q2, FY17 Adj.

PHOTO: AFP [DAVOS] Open markets and global trade have been blamed for job losses over the last decade, but global CEOs say the real culprits are increasingly machines. And while business leaders gathered at the annual World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos relish the productivity gains technology can bring, they warned this week that the collateral damage to jobs needs to be addressed more seriously. From taxi drivers to healthcare professionals, technologies such as robotics, driverless cars, artificial intelligence and 3-D printing mean more and more types of jobs are at risk. Adidas, for example, aims to use 3-D printing in the manufacture of some running shoes. "Jobs will be lost, jobs will evolve and this revolution is going to be ageless, it's going to be classless and it's going to affect everyone," said Meg Whitman, chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. SEE ALSO: Americans distrustful after hacking epidemic: survey So while some supporters of Donald Trump and Brexit may hope new government policies will bring lost jobs back to America's Rust Belt or Britain's industrial north, economists estimate 86 per cent of US manufacturing job losses are actually down to productivity, according to the WEF's annual risks report. "Technology is the big issue and we don't acknowledge that," Mark Weinberger, chairman of consultancy EY, said on Thursday, arguing there was a tendency to always blame trading partners. The political backdrop is prompting CEOs to take more seriously the challenge of long-life training of workforces to keep up with the exponential growth of technological advances. "I think what we're reaching now is a time when we may have to find alternative careers through our lifetime," Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella told Reuters. Over the last decade, more jobs have been lost to technology than any other factor, and John Drzik, head of global risk at insurance broker Marsh, expects more of the same. "That is going to raise challenges, particularly given the political context," Mr Drzik, who helped compile the WEF report, said. Compared to clamping down on immigration by tightening borders, dealing with the impact of technology destroying jobs is something that is perhaps even less easily controlled. For while many advanced technologies remain more expensive than low- or medium-skilled labour in the near term, the shift is likely to accelerate as costs come down. WIDENING GAP Technological advancements require governments, businesses and academic institutions to develop more educated and highly skilled workforces, executives in Davos said. But this shift to skilled workers also widens the income gap and fuels growing inequality. Jonas Prising, CEO of staffing firm ManpowerGroup, noted that US unemployment is only about 2 to 2.5 per cent among college-educated people but 9 or 10 per cent among those with low or no skills. "The idea that we would ban automation as part of an evolution within the manufacturing industry, is not really part of the discussion," Mr Prising said. He pointed to policies in countries like Denmark and Italy, where there is a focus on employability of workers. "If we don't own responsibility (for the problem of displaced workers), it's only going to get bigger," Procter & Gamble Chief Executive David Taylor said. BRAWN AND BRAIN The scope of the employment risk from what the WEF calls the"fourth industrial revolution" which "blurs the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres" is unclear. A University of Oxford study in 2013 said nearly half of US jobs were at risk, while in 2015 Forrester Research predicted a net loss of only 7 per cent by 2025, as some lost jobs will be replaced with new ones. Forrester predicts that by 2019, one-quarter of all job tasks will be offloaded to software robots, physical robots, or customer self-service automation. Even the corner office may not be safe. "CEOs feel reasonably confident we are not going to be replaced by artificial intelligence," Inga Beale, CEO of the Lloyd's of London insurance market, said. "But I'm sure there will be a time!"
