No single company is perfect, but together they show what the corporate ideal could look like. The platonic ideal “Good marketers see consumers as complete human beings with all the dimensions real people have.” – Jonah Sachs, Winning the Story Wars The practice For the last 16 years Safaricom, Kenya’s largest publicly traded company and East Africa’s largest telecom, has focused on signing up more mobile subscribers. With 87% of Kenya’s population already subscribed to mobile phone plans, Safaricom, partly owned by Britain’s Vodafone—along with its newer rivals such as India’s Bharti Airtel or Orange Kenya, partly owned by France’s Orange SA—are now chasing a smaller slice of the pie. So far, Safaricom is grabbing the most of that slice, with about 25 million subscribers and a market share of almost 70%. Its mobile-money platform, M-pesa, is the world’s largest, with more than $50 billion in transactions a year; it’s used by more than half of Kenyan adults.  “We had a bit of a challenge where we had people using Safaricom by default just because it’s big.” But Safaricom, one of the earliest telecoms in the region, worries it won’t always be on top. Competition is becoming more intense and customers have more choices. Safaricom, while dominant, lacked customer loyalty, its executives realized more than a year ago. “We had a bit of a challenge where we had people using Safaricom by default just because it’s big. It’s there,” says Charles Wanjohi, head of customer segmentation, who was hired from rival Airtel to start the department last year. “The challenge is how to make all these 25 million people love you.” To achieve that, the company has been going through a transformation over the past year. It’s been focused on changing itself into a “consumer-led” business. This means using data and research to organize marketing, distribution, customer service, and product offerings—basically all decisions—around niche markets. Potential and existing Safaricom customers are classified and analyzed not just by their age and income, but instead according to a series of “psychographics,” or attitudes and aspirations. Instead of looking to other telecom companies, Safaricom emulates consumer goods companies like Procter and Gamble that have long used principles of market segmentation. Safaricom’s consumer segments are based on four broad categories, divided into 16 sub-segments, which include: “young flashers,” entry-level professionals eager to show off their newfound wealth; “savvy loyalists,” self-employed entrepreneurs age 4o and up who like to keep their money under wraps; “mature trendies,” young families; or the “prudent young,” youth who work and have responsibilities. Some of these segments are broken into smaller groups, a process that Wanjohi says is “ever evolving.” They are based in their average spending, or “ARPU” average revenue per user, education level, age, and less tangible factors like their “attitude toward life.” The company has begun more heavily targeting Kenya’s various regions over the past year. These range from pastoralist communities to the coast where most of the country’s Muslims live, or tribes that prefer their own language over Kiswahili or English, Kenya’s two national languages, notes Musau. A lot of Wanjohi’s efforts have been getting the staff to think in the mindset of its customers. Charts of the “Safaricom universe” are taped to the cubicles outside Wanjohi’s office. Staff parties are held where different departments dress up as a consumer segment. All marketing campaigns are customized to target these specific groups. The approach applies to customer service, too. Staff at the its customer care centers are subdivided according to the customer segments they serve. Customers queue inside a Safaricom mobile phone care center downtown Nairobi. (Reuters/Thomas Mukoya) “One fundamental thing is that we have become cognizant of the customer in all our decision making, across the whole company, “Wanjohi said. Immersive research has been important as well. Wanjohi recently assigned his staff an exercise in understanding one of their lower income groups, the “mass segment” customer. Teams were sent out to buy 4,000 shillings ($40) worth of goods they thought that consumer would buy. The same amount of money was given to real customers that his team then followed on their shopping trip.  Customers are classified and analyzed according to their attitudes and aspirations. The results were surprising. Instead of spending the bulk of their money on basic food items and Kenyan staples like maize and flour, these shoppers also bought more costly basics like rice, cooking oil, laundry detergent, and toothpaste, in small amounts. “The exercise taught us that to understand each segment, we had to experience what it’s like for consumers within that segment,” Wanjohi said. The segment the company is most focused on now is Kenya’s 11 million working-age young people. They don’t have a lot of buying power now, but as many as 1 million Kenyans between the ages of 15 and 25 are signing up for mobile phone services a year, according to Musau. In a few years they will start earning an income. Wanjohi says the company expects to see 25% of its growth to come from the youth market over the next few years. To appeal to this group of “high pot students,” or high potential university students, “tweens,” youth as young as 10 years old, or “prudent young,” Safaricom launched a sub-brand called BLAZE in June. The brand—which includes cell phones, SIM cards, and customizable phone plans to mentorship programs, youth summits, and a television show—is built around the idea of being your own boss, or BYOB. Mentors and BLAZE brand ambassadors are self-employed young Kenyans who have established untraditional careers in things like Thai boxing, dancing, or music. “When we landed on this segment of young people, we found this tension that people want success but the opportunities are very limited, ” Wanjohi said. As many as half a million new Kenyan graduates are competing for just 30,000 jobs a year, one reason why the country has the highest youth unemployment rates, almost 20%, in East Africa. The takeaways In the year since Safaricom began focusing on segmentation, its net profit rose 19.5% for the year ending March 2016 to 38.1 billion Kenyan shillings ($375 million). Its increase in customers this past year, almost 8%, was the highest in five years, according to Musau. “[This approach] is already translating into success when you look into our engagement and brand scores with consumers,” Wanjohi said, but declined to share those scores. Wanjohi admits that there has been a learning curve. His department has had to overturn assumptions about young Kenyans. “There’s a perception that the youth are all about the party lifestyle, but we found they are very driven and very entrepreneurial from a very young age.”  The biggest risk is offending customers with simplistic or off-base characterizations. Another issue has been translating segmentation into usable measures of performance. “You can define the consumer very well, you can see the consumer in your head, but if you can’t match the consumer with the internal reporting system then you have a big challenge,” Wanjohi says. “The challenge is how do you make sure you marry the customer description with how they are described in the reporting system? So, when you are doing the reporting … you can say, ‘This is the customer group that is bringing the growth.'” The biggest risk in this approach may be offending customers with simplistic or off-base characterizations. “Very few firms ever recover from this,” says Mary Onguko, relationship manager at Imarasat, a broadband provider to African businesses who published a 2014 paper on segmentation on Kenya’s telecom industry.  “How you name your consumers affects your perception of them.” Airtel, one of Safaricom’s rivals, once focused almost entirely on mobile phone users of the highest-income group, ignoring the larger but poorer wanjiku or “common man.” Airtel has since tried to reverse course, Onguko says, but now lags Safaricom, which took that opportunity to establish itself as the everyman’s service provider. It’s partly for this reason that Wanjohi is hesitant to reveal all the names the company has used to describe its segments. Some of them have verged on the offensive, leading Wanjohi to make some recent “refinements” to the category names. To him, this is as important for implementation as it is for appearance. “How you name your consumers affects your perception of them,” he says. “You need to have a picture of the customer in your mind. You always want to have a positive view of the customer group.” Sign up for the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief — the most important and interesting news from across the continent, in your inbox.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Sep 11, 2016 at 9:49AM Image source: Getty Images. There are significant benefits to including a few dividend-paying stocks in your portfolio. Not only can they produce steadier returns with lower stock price volatility, but their payments help investors take advantage of market swings simply through automatic reinvestment plans. Then, as retirement approaches and income becomes a bigger priority, you can easily start taking dividends in cash, rather than directing them toward automatic stock purchases. Here are a few companies that pay substantial dividends and boast a solid track record of raising that payout over time. Below, I'll highlight some reasons to consider adding a few of them to your portfolio.  Company Dividend Yield Payout Ratio Profit Margin Waste Management 2.6% 62% 9% Home Depot 2.1% 43% 8% Johnson & Johnson 2.7% 57% 21% Hershey  2.5% 68% 10% UPS 2.9% 54% 8% Wal-Mart 2.7% 32% 3% Yum! Brands 2.0% 54% 11% Data source: Company financial filings and YCharts. Johnson & Johnson's stellar track record For consistency, it doesn't get much better than Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). The medical and pharmaceutical conglomerate has raised its dividend for 54 consecutive years -- one of the longest such streaks on the stock market.  Its massive scale in a consistently growing healthcare market has helped shares rise by a nearly 11% compound rate since 1985. Its 70% gross profit margin, meanwhile, not only beats other dividend payers on the above list but also outpaces more directly comparable companies, like Procter & Gamble and 3M.  JNJ Gross Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts. Johnson & Johnson is growing faster than these industry giants, as well, which is a testament to its unusually strong competitive position. At 22 times last year's earnings, this stock isn't particularly cheap. Yet the company has consistently demonstrated why it deserves a premium valuation.  Home Depot's outsized profit gains If it's fast growth that you're after, then consider Home Depot (NYSE:HD). The home improvement giant's profits are on a multi-year upswing, thanks to a rising housing market that has plenty of room to continue climbing. Annual net income soared from below $4 billion in 2012 to over $7 billion last year. LOW Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts. Home Depot targets returning 50% of those profits to shareholders in the form of dividends every year, which explains why the payout has skyrocketed lately. That's a more aggressive goal than rival Lowe's and its 35% payout promise. Dividends aren't the only area where Home Depot beats its smaller competitor: Sales growth, profit margins, and capital efficiency metrics all point toward Home Depot as the stronger stock purchase right now.  Yum! Brands' profitable new focus Finally, Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM), the owner of KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell restaurants, looks attractive right now for two big reasons. First, its operating results are strong. Earnings are up 30% over the last six months, thanks to rising restaurant-level margins and an aggressively expanding store base. Image source: Getty Images. Sure, comparable-store sales growth is slowing, but that is an industrywide issue and one that Yum!, with its diverse set of fast-food offerings, should be able to weather better than rivals.  Second, the restaurant chain is on the cusp of shedding its China KFC business, which will free management to focus its energies on improving market share in the U.S. The spinoff will also produce plenty of capital -- much of which Yum! plans to return to investors through stock buybacks and dividend increases.  Each of these investments carries specific risks that could cause the stock to underperform in the future. Dividends don't change that basic truth. Yet by focusing on dividend payers, investors enjoy tangible returns in exchange for their patience, which makes it easier to stomach volatility on the way to -- ideally -- market-beating long-term stock price appreciation.   Demitrios Kalogeropoulos owns shares of Home Depot.

Lewis, a beloved character played by Emmy winner Larry Gates for 13 years until his death on December 12, 1996. T.J. Hargrave played Tim Werner on Guiding Light. 2001: Nearly 3,000 people were killed in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 at the World Trade Center site in New York City, near Shanksville, Pa., and at the Pentagon. Former Guiding Light child actor T.J. Hargrave, who played Tim (T.J.) Werner, was working as a vice president of Cantor Fitzgerald at the time of the attacks on the World Trade Center, and lost his life that day.

[PHOTO: ELVIS OGINA/STANDARD] While most Africans are battling the dark spots and other skin complications, Westerners are tackling the issue of skin wrinkles. The need for Africans to fix their skins has created a cosmetic market that has attracted multinationals. With a population growth expected to hit 2.5 billion by 2050, according to the UN Habitant Report of 2015, Africa is indeed a gold mine for the cosmetic business. Some of the international players are L’Oreal, Procter & Gamble and Unilever, who have developed expansion strategies to capture the beauty and personal care market in the African continent. Spending on cosmetics per capita on the continent is 10 to 20 times lower than in developed markets, according to market strategy consultants Roland Berger, and marketers are increasingly eager to tap into this potential for future growth. In Kenya, the beauty industry has created jobs for many as women spend fortunes on skin care products. One such individual is Peris Mbuthia, a mother-of-two and founder of Timeless Medical Spa based in Nairobi. “I was on holiday in Mombasa when I developed a rash which really affected my face and I needed it fixed but I could not find a trained beauty aesthetician,” says Ms Mbuthia. From this, she saw a business opportunity and flew to Canada to strategise on her new business venture. She then enrolled for a diploma in medical aesthetics, which focuses on improving cosmetic appearance through the treatment of skin conditions.

She later got space at the Lavington Mall where she spent Sh3 million on an interior designer who did not meet her expectations. Being one not to easily give up, she tried another designer who also disappointed. “This was more than just business gone wrong. I needed to make an impact and do something for my community and for my country. It was all about me not giving up on my dreams,” Ms Mbuthia says. After many false starts, she set up Timeless Medical Spa in June last year. The spa focuses on the growing middle class, seeking beauty and wellness. It offers services like skin relaxing, renewal and revival of one’s beautiful skin to perfection, using safe, effective and non-invasive cutting edge technology.

(File photos) Print Email Mary Serreze | Special to The Republican By Mary Serreze | Special to The Republican masslive.com Follow on Twitter on September 11, 2016 at 2:57 PM, updated September 11, 2016 at 8:14 PM comments This story has been updated with a statement from Rep. Susannah Whipps Lee. ORANGE — Denise Andrews, an Orange native and Democrat in the North Quabbin region, announced Sunday she is dropping out of the race for state representative in the 2nd Franklin District. "I have made a very difficult decision to withdraw from this race and to accept a recently offered opportunity in the private sector; I believe this decision is best for my family and me," Andrews said in a statement. Andrews did not return a call Sunday afternoon seeking comment. Andrews' withdrawal leaves Republican incumbent Susannah Whipps Lee running uncontested. It would have been Andrew's third showdown with Lee, and her fourth campaign for statewide office. Andrews held the seat for four years after handily winning the 2010 election in a three-way contest that did not include Lee. In 2012, Andrews defeated Lee by fewer than 200 votes. During the 2012 election season, The Republican reported that Andrews went to Athol police saying an anonymous source had told her Lee had bought cocaine. The accusation proved to be unfounded. Lee, who runs a family-owned manufacturing business in Athol, was outraged, and called Andrew's actions "scurrilous." In 2014, Lee trounced Andrews with nearly 55 percent of the vote. The district comprises 12 towns: Athol, Belchertown precinct A, Erving, Gill, New Salem, Orange, Petersham, Phillipston, Royalston, Templeton, Warwick, and Wendell. A 2012 redistricting removed Greenfield, a Democratic stronghold, and added half of Belchertown. Andrews opened her campaign headquarters in Orange in late July, where she told The Republican she no longer works for the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis, a job she took after the 2010 election. Instead, she said, she is running Legacy Unlimited, her consulting firm that offers corporate diversity training. She had formerly been a 25-year manager with Proctor and Gamble. Andrews on Sunday thanked her supporters and said she will "continue to work toward advancing a progressive, inclusive, and effective democracy through helping to elect leaders and advance projects and policies that improve our government to better serve all of our citizens." Lee owns Whipps, Inc., a metal firm in Athol that designs and manufactures water control gates for public and private civil engineering projects. She issued a statement Sunday afternoon. "Running for office and deciding what is best for you and your family are very personal decisions," said Lee. "I wish Denise the best of luck with her new job opportunity. My campaign for re-election is going to continue as planned, we will be working just as hard and taking no vote for granted from now through Election Day."

Fashion icon, actress and cat lover, Katie Cassidy, partnered with Fresh Step to bring felines and fashion together on the catwalk to turn the cat lady stigma upside down at the Fresh Step Feline Fashion Lounge and Adoption Event. The runway show held Saturday, Sept. 10 featured the latest feline-inspired fashion and the trend that never goes out of style – adoptable cats! In addition, a limited edition #hot2adopt T-shirt was unveiled at the fashion show, with proceeds benefiting partner shelters and rescues across the country. "From cat eye glasses and leopard prints to kitten heels and cat-faced flats, feline-inspired fashions have infiltrated runways for many years," said Cassidy. "Typically, cat owners aren't described by their style, but that's about to change with the launch of the Hot to Adopt campaign where felines and fashion are coming together to support cat adoption." While cats have always been highly regarded in the fashion world, their owners don't always get the same respect. According to a recent survey* asking people to describe cat owners, nearly half (43 percent) replied "weird or quirky". The study also confirmed the most common phrase associated with "cat lady" is "crazy." More than a third of respondents say that litter box odor (39 percent) is the worst thing about owning a cat. Whether it's the unfair bias toward cat owners and the cat lady stigma or fear of a stinky cat litter box, Fresh Step is committed to eliminating all barriers to cat adoption and celebrating cat ownership. "Cat owners can get a bad rap and are tired of the negative stereotypes like the 'crazy cat lady'," explains Nick Meyer, Director of Marketing, Clorox Pet Products. "Fresh Step is out to change that. Our Hot to Adopt program aims to embrace and celebrate cats and cat people -- loud and proud -- so we can encourage more adoptions." "Cat bias is a real issue. Sadly, three out of four shelters pets are cats and they are adopted at lower rates than other companion animals," said Stephanie Mattera, the Spokesperson for the Mayor's Alliance for NYC's Animals. "That's why Fresh Step's Hot to Adopt campaign is so important! We hope that people will see past the outdated cat lady stigma and open their hearts and homes to cats." Fresh Step wants people to step out and wear their love of cats by celebrating modern cat ladies (and gents), by declaring "Feline Fashion Fridays" through the month of October to showcase unique feline-inspired looks. Cat owners can show their love of cats by posting a picture of themselves with their cat to Fresh Step's Instagram using #freshstepcontest each Friday for a chance to win free Fresh Step litter, a $250 VISA Gift Card and the limited edition #hot2adopt T-shirt. "With millions of cats entering shelters each year and less than half getting adopted, Fresh Step is on a mission to help every shelter cat find a forever home, because we understand how rewarding it is to have cats in our lives," said Meyer. "Fresh Step has a long history of celebrating cat ownership through shelter partnerships, but there is more work to be done in order to break down any barriers to adoption, including cat lady stigmas, and increase adoptions nationwide." Share your love of cats and join Fresh Step's mission to help every shelter cat find a forever home. Make it #hot2adopt by wearing your cat pride. A portion ($7.50) of the purchase price of Fresh Step's specially designed T-shirt will benefit shelter cats across the country. Model your support that it's #hot2adopt. Available for $20.00 at freshstep.com. The Fresh Step Hot to Adopt Feline Fashion Lounge and Adoption Event took place on Saturday, Sept. 10, at the Lori Bookstein Fine Art Gallery on 138 10th Avenue, New York, New York, 10011.  Zani's Furry Friends, Little Shelter Animal Rescue and Adoption Center, and The Humane Society of New York, participating organizations with The Mayor's Alliance of NYC's Cats will be on-site with adoptable cats.

Prisoners were used to clean the beaches after the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf, the largest marine oil spill in history. Exposed to deadly toxins, they were given no protective gear, evidence that prisoners used as slave labor are expendable. I am not shocked, I am not appalled, but every time this fact clicks in my brain that people don’t know, it truly takes me into an OMG moment. This is one of the biggest wow factors that I have ever experienced. Just think about it. Scenario: I am looking you square dead in your eyes and I am telling you that SLAVERY STILL EXISTS. OK, it may take some time for you to register this information because what you see around you are shopping malls, schools, restaurants, libraries, game rooms, beaches, hotels, grocery stores, highways, camping sites, resorts, schools, movie theaters, night clubs, gas stations, amusement parks – you see a functioning society full of all of life’s joys and people who are moving about freely. Some are going left, some are going right, and some are going north, some are going south, some are walking, some are driving, some are traveling by plane, bus and train, and some are even sitting still. You see them and they exist all around you. A large number of them are New Afrikan (Black people), and they don’t have to go to the back of the bus or even use separate bathrooms; they are enjoying life’s pleasures right along with everyone else. You see them in motion and you don’t see anyone in chains, shackles, or torn and tattered clothing. This is not what you see. The idea that slavery exists doesn’t fit in the equation of what you see around you. After processing my statement and your present reality, you turn to me and ask me, “What the hell are you talking about? I’m free. I am not a slave.” I proceed to tell you that what you understand is an illusion and it can change in the blink of an eye. Just one incorrect move can alter your “Amerikkkan dream.” Now I have your full attention because you enjoy driving your vehicle that you work so hard to make the monthly payments on. You enjoy your two-bedroom apartment full of nice furniture that you worked overtime to get so that you can impress and entertain your family and friends, inviting them over for snacks, card games and on holidays like every family should be able to do. This young prisoner in a forced labor camp in Georgia in 1932 is being punished. Prisoners worked as slaves can be tortured or killed without any monetary loss, so they are more expendable than slaves, who comprised a slave owner’s wealth. – Photo: John Spivak You enjoy that and, most importantly, you worked your ass off for it. To think that it could be gone in a blink of an eye and to think that you could be a slave is laughable: Ha ha ha. It’s unheard of, right? NO. I hate to be the bearer of bad news – i.e., the party pooper – but I have to be. My freedom depends on your understanding this undeniable fact. “We aren’t free until we all are free” is a saying not utilized by capitalists – in this case, slave owners. It is a saying used by freedom seekers and those who seek not to exploit the labor of others, those who wish to live in a just society. All must understand that YES, SLAVERY STILL EXISTS. So now you are all ears. Good. The United Snakes Constitution is a legal document which lays out the system of fundamental principles according to which the U.S. is governed. I would like to bring your attention to the 13th Amendment of 1865, the law that abolished slavery, or so we are taught. Unfortunately, many overlook the clause that tries to make continued slavery acceptable to the daughters and sons of our ancestors who were enslaved and those who fought like hell not to be. The 13th Amendment states in full, “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.” Now this is pretty much in layman’s terms; it’s simply saying that if you have been convicted of a crime and you are captured you can and most likely will be subjected to slavery regardless if you like it or not. Why? Because it is the law. Get it? Got it? Good. So now you say: “That’s wrong. That’s insane. That’s horrible. Why would they do that? Why would they have that there in the Constitution?” The answer is this: Slavery was the best thing to ever happen to the United Snakes of Amerikkka. Slavery was and is today its bread and butter. To understand the U.S. and how it functions, you must understand capitalism. Capitalism at its core is a system built off and maintained on profit – profit and wealth for the individual and not the masses. In order for capitalism to exist, the people, we the people must remain powerless, while a few individuals, stakeholders, corporations control the wealth of nations. Only the overseer’s uniform and the modern photography tell us that this is 1975, not 1775. The prisoners are picking cotton on the Cummins Prison Farm in Texas, where many current prisons are former plantations. Texas and Georgia are the only states that pay prisoners nothing at all for their labor. – Photo courtesy The Marshall Project The mode of production is fueled by human labor. This mode of production became rampant and well defined with the rise of slavery, particularly with the enslavement of African people. As production and goods began to serve the interests of the few and wealth was being made, MORE, MORE and MORE became the desire of those who were benefiting from slavery. They then contemplated on ways to become masters of the economy, and with the growth of industrialization and the supposed abolishment of slavery, they moved to wage slave labor, which most Americans unconsciously commit their daily lives to when they go to work every day. For the Afrikan in America who was supposed to be free, there were still great and many challenges. Jim Crow laws enforced and justified plenty of reasons to capture and imprison men and women, who were officially considered free, for crimes of all sorts. You could be captured and imprisoned for things like looking at a European (white person), spitting on the sidewalk, talking too loud or walking on the wrong side of the street – almost anything would give way to your imprisonment. Lawmakers and those who were displeased with slavery being supposedly abolished understood that they would lose money. Who would harvest their crops? Who would till their lands? Who would be the mammies for their children? Who would they release their sexual desires on? Who would they enjoy torturing? Who could they maim? No more slaves meant an end to the lifestyle they so enjoyed. This made them angry and furious. There has to be a way around this, they figured. With anger, rage and a well thought out plan to imprison former slaves, they won again. Imprisoned people, particularly those of African descent, would be forced to work in coal mines, railroads, as indentured servants for alleged unpaid taxes or debt, and things of that nature for all the days of their lives. The only difference between these prisoners sent to work on a plantation after the Civil War – in a system known as convict leasing – and the slaves they had been before the Civil War is their stripes. Many of us were subjected to convict leasing, a system of penal labor practiced in the Southern United States. Convict leasing provided prisoner labor to private parties, such as plantation owners and corporations, such as the Tennessee Coal and Iron Co. The lessee was responsible for feeding, clothing and housing the prisoners just as they had in the centuries that they held slaves. The state of Louisiana leased out convicts as early as 1844, but the system expanded all through the South with the emancipation of slaves at the end of the American Civil War in 1865. In 1898 some 73 percent of Alabama’s entire annual state revenue came from convict leasing. Capitalist wealth since then has continued to grow due to prison slave labor. As of 2014, 37 percent of the prison population consists of New Afrikans. This is not by chance. Mass incarceration is steadily increasing as the laws are strategically in place to incarcerate men and women on a daily basis – just the same as the Jim Crow laws that were in place not so long ago. The slavery-for-convicts clause in the 13th Amendment safeguards, protects and gives the right to profiteers, stakeholders, corporations and government entities to use slave labor for profit and refuse to be morally responsible for the injustice of slavery. They lose no sleep at night behind the idea that we are still slaves just like the old days. This is not a scene out of ancient history. Prison slavery is rampant today but rarely as visible as this. Another example of the past that wasn’t so long ago operating under the same amendment are chain gangs. A chain gang is a group of prisoners chained together to perform menial or physically challenging work as a form of punishment. Such punishment might include repairing buildings, building roads or clearing land. This system also existed primarily in the Southern United States and by 1955 had been phased out nationwide, with Georgia the last state to abandon the practice. Chain gangs were reintroduced by a few states during the “get tough on crime” 1990s, with Alabama being the first state to revive them, in 1995. The experiment ended after about one year in all states except Arizona, where in Maricopa County inmates can still volunteer for a chain gang to earn credit toward a high school diploma or avoid disciplinary lockdowns for rule infractions. The introduction of chain gangs into the United States began shortly after the Civil War. The Southern states needed finances and public works to be performed. Using prisoners as slave labor was a way to do it for free. This information isn’t hard to find; I got the above on Wikipedia. I hope that you are uncomfortable now, but I am not done. So that wasn’t so long ago. America is built off of big business. Here are a few of big businesses that are a part of most citizens’ everyday lives and that use prisoners as slave labor, legally: Victoria’s Secret, BP, Whole Foods, AT&T, Bank of America, Bayer, Cargill, Caterpillar, Chevron, Chrysler, Costco, John Deere, Eli Lilly and Company, Exxon Mobil, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson and Johnson, K-Mart, Koch Industries, McDonald’s, Merck, Microsoft, Motorola, Nintendo, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, Pepsi, ConAgra Foods, Shell, Starbucks, UPS, Verizon, Walmart and Wendy’s. Most men and women in prison make anywhere from 25 cents per hour up to $1.15 per hour. This is the true meaning of “Made in America” when we see it on many of our product labels. This legalized slavery is often called insourcing. Insourcing is the most cost effective way for the capitalist to keep production costs low and profit high, without suffering criticism for outsourcing, sending jobs overseas. Imagine how sad Ronald McDonald would be if McDonald’s had to pay real wages for its products produced by prisoners working for pennies an hour. Boycott McDonald’s and tell them you’ll come back when they stop using prison slave labor. They can keep America great by utilizing that slavery-for-convicts clause in the 13th Amendment. McDonald’s, known for serving over 68 million customers a day, is the world’s most successful fast food franchise. Did you know that prisoners manufacture the plastic cutlery, containers and uniforms? McDonald’s also uses prison slave labor to produce frozen foods. Prisoners process beef for patties. They also process bread, milk and chicken products. Another added incentive for the greedy amongst us is the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC), which gives employers a tax credit of $2,400 for every work-release inmate they employ as a reward for hiring “risky target groups.” It’s also an added plus when the employer doesn’t have to provide things like vacation days and sick days, 401k retirement plans, or medical and health benefits. Look at all the money that is being saved by using the slave labor of prisoners instead of using the labor of ordinary wage slaves in the work force. Prison slave labor is the way to go for greedy employers. For workers trying to support their families, it means depressed wages or unemployment. Guess what else is made in prisons – U.S. military equipment, a billion-dollar industry. There are also all sorts of everyday items; the list goes on and on. Word on the street is that prisoners are even raising seeing-eye dogs for blind people. UNICOR proudly displays this picture of a woman prisoner, a slave laborer. Aside from the private corporations, there are even larger entities profiting off prisoner slave labor that you must be made aware of. One is UNICOR, a very guilty party in this modern day slavery here in Amerikkka. Federal Prison Industries, also known as UNICOR or FPI, is a corporation created in 1934 and owned by the federal government to oversee prisoner slave labor and set the condition and wage standards for prisoners working in federal prisons. UNICOR’s official reason for being is that in exchange for their slave labor, prisoners are given “vocational training.” Yet the workplace conditions are often appalling, and the transfer of skills to the private sector is dubious. UNICOR operates many call centers. “When you call a company or government agency for help, there’s a good chance the person on the other end of the line is a prison inmate,” NBC News reports. In the first half of 2016, UNICOR generated $231 million in sales. Since 2014, UNICOR has focused on employing prisoners within two years of release; in 2015, 24 percent of the Bureau of Prisons population was that close to release, and UNICOR’s workforce was approximately 30,000. The workers produce about 175 different types of products and services, including clothing and textiles, electronics, fleet management and vehicular components, industrial products, office furniture, recycling activities, and services including data entry and encoding. Prison slavery: Prisoners are driven to work in the fields of another former plantation in Texas, now a prison known as the Ellis Unit. – Photo courtesy The Marshall Project Another expendable prison worker – or slave – Danny Lyon dies of heat exhaustion at the Ellis Unit in Texas in 1942. According to Prison Policy Initiative, UNICOR pays from 23 cents to $1.15 per hour. Workers in state prisons make an average of 59 cents an hour. Prisoners in two state, Georgia and Texas, are paid nothing at all. A 1977 Supreme Court decision made it illegal for prisoners to form labor unions. So I ask you, if UNICOR in federal prisons and the state prison systems are supposed to be about vocational training and reentry into society, why are prisoners making under $2 an hour? Why aren’t they at least making minimum wage with that money put away in an account to be there upon their release along with other earned incentives? The answer: That would be a service to humanity and a service to humanity would be a blow to capitalism. The cheapest way is the best way. Cheap and free labor keeps capitalists’ bellies fat and pockets full while we the people starve and stay broke and live off of crumbs like, you know, slaves. That is the way the system of slavery works. Get it? Got it? Good. Lastly, I must mention Corrections Corporation of America (CCA). CCA owns and manages private prisons and detention centers. One of its founders is Thomas W. Beasley, a leader in the Republican Party. It received its initial investment in 1983 from Hospital Corporation of America founder Jack C. Massey, the Tennessee Valley Authority and Vanderbilt University. As of 2015, the company is the largest private corrections company in the United States. It manages more than 65 correctional and detention facilities with a capacity of more than 90,000 beds in 19 states and the District of Columbia. The company’s revenue in 2012 exceeded $1.7 billion, according to Wikipedia. “The High Cost of Cheap Detentions” by Edwin S. Rubenstein, quotes Prudential Securities saying about CCA: “It takes time to bring inmate population levels up to where they cover costs. Low occupancy is a drag on profits … Company earnings would be strong if CCA succeeded in ramping up population levels in its new facilities at an acceptable rate.” Angola, Louisiana’s largest prison, is an 18,000-acre former slave plantation, worked today by enslaved prisoners who are the descendants of the slaves who worked it before the Civil War. CCA’s prime objective is to KEEP THE PRISON FULL! They are needing you to be there. You are to be locked behind bars. This is the goal. This is the mandate. In 2012, CCA sent a letter to prison officials in 48 states, offering to buy prisons from these states in exchange for a 20-year management contract and a guaranteed occupancy rate of 90 percent. Community organizations have criticized the proposals, arguing that the contractual obligations of states to fill the prisons to 90 percent occupancy is poor public policy that could force communities into creating criminals, writes Chris Kirkham in “With States Facing Shortfalls, Private Corporation Offers Cash for Prisons,” a story posted Feb. 14, 2012, in the Huffington Post. THE RALLY CRY IS KEEP PRISONS FULL – maintaining and increasing mass incarceration. So I urge you to not only open your ears and your eyes, but I urge you to open your mouths and use your hands and your legs and all of your might to abolish the slavery-for-convicts clause by amending the 13th Amendment. I beg of you, if you have any sense of right from wrong, to challenge this system and bring an end to slavery once and for all. You must get involved, and there are many things that you can do. You must support the strikers right now. They need you. They need us. You must deliver a gut busting blow to corporations like McDonald’s and continue to expose their fallacies so that people will stop buying their products and take off their mask. It is our duty. You must remember that if not you, your child and/or other loved ones will be next. Write us a letter at George Jackson University and ask about other ways you can get involved. Call and ask what’s to be done. You can very well be pulled over, forced to get out of your car, and the next thing you know you are dead or in jail. If you are imprisoned, you just may become a 2016 slave; it’s real in the field. Tim Anderson reminds us that this is “The Unites States of Incarceration.” The U.S. has a huge per capita prison population, second only to the Seychelles, a group of islands in the Indian Ocean with a total population of 92,000 which imprisons many Somali pirates. Although only 5 percent of the world’s population lives in the U.S., this country incarcerates 25 percent of the world’s prisoners. Racism, drug laws, mandatory minimum sentencing and, of course, privatization of prisons all play a part. The partnership of the U.S. government with big business allows prisoners to be used as slave labor, another great incentive for filling prisons. Prison overcrowding is common. Instead of helping and rehabilitating people, the U.S. uses them for profit – another grotesque feature of a capitalist system fixated on making money over everything else. You must remember this as you go about your daily routine. Don’t be comfortable. You should be mad; you should be angry. Michael Leibowitz writes about the nature of capitalism in his book, “The Socialist Alternative: Real Human Development”: “The logic of capital generates a society in which all human values are subordinated to the search for profits. … Rather than building a cohesive and caring society, capital tears society apart. It divides workers and pits them against one another as competitors to reduce any challenge to its rule and its bottom line. Precisely because human beings and nature are mere means to capital’s goal, it destroys what Marx called the original sources of wealth – human beings and nature.” Don’t let capitalism make you into a monster. The monster of all monsters is ignoring that there is a problem. If you don’t work to eradicate these crimes against humanity and you consciously know they exist, doing nothing at all … SHAME ON YOU.

California’s “liberal” attorney general opposed reducing vastly overcrowded prisons in California for fear the state would have to pay real wages to fight its wildfires. Though extremely dangerous, firefighting is considered a premium job in California for prisoners, and most of those chosen are not people of color. - Tweet More Pocket Share on Tumblr Print Related Tags Filed Under: Prison Stories Tags: “get tough on crime” 1990s • “The High Cost of Cheap Detentions” by Edwin S.

September 10 2016 at 10:00am By Martinne Geller and Randy Fabi REUTERS A saleswoman from Wardah cosmetics, an Indonesian brand specialising in products for Muslim women, attends to a customer at a sales booth in a mall in Jakarta, Indonesia. File picture: Beawiharta London/Jakarta - Some of the world's biggest consumer groups are making halaal face creams and shampoos for Indonesia ahead of a new labelling law, part of a broader push to cater to growing Muslim populations as sales in many Western markets slow. Unilever, Beiersdorf and L'Oreal are among the multinationals converting their supply chains for the world's biggest Muslim-majority nation. The law, the first of its kind, requires food to be labelled halaal or not in 2017, followed by toiletries in 2018 and medicines in 2019. The companies say demand for beauty products that are halaal, or target specific issues like veiled hair, will grow as the Muslim middle class grows. They note that Indonesia could influence other countries such as Malaysia where halaal products made locally or by small, niche companies are also popular. Halaal certification is official recognition that a product was manufactured in keeping with Islamic sharia law. This means it must not contain traces of pork, alcohol or blood, and must be made on factory lines free of contamination risk, including from cleaning. Makers of cosmetics and toiletries say the burden is more administrative than financial, and therefore see compliance as unlocking new revenue streams. “It's an enabler to do business in certain areas of the world,” said Dirk Mampe of German chemicals company BASF, which sells ingredients to toiletries manufacturers and now has 145 of them certified halaal. The halaal ingredients do not carry premium price tags, he said. “There is a trend that these halaal products are being requested more and more, and the importance of being able to supply them is increasing.” More than 1.5 billion people around the world are Muslim, accounting for about a quarter of the global population. Halaal cosmetics were estimated to make up 11 percent of a global halaal market worth more than $1 trillion in 2015, according to Deloitte Tohmatsu Consulting. Market research firm TechNavio sees halaal personal care products' sales growing 14 percent per year until 2019, outpacing the broader market. Not-so-secret formula French cosmetics giant L'Oreal already has a halaal-certified factory in Indonesia that supplies the domestic market and its Southeast Asian neighbours. Most products under its Garnier brand, from face washes to skin lightening creams, are halaal-certified, a spokeswoman said. The personal care industry already depends largely on plant-derived ingredients, so the rules for halaal often affect production more than formulation. But certification can get complicated. For example, the maker of an Indonesian skin cream with a dozen ingredients from around the world would need to give Indonesian authorities proof from other certification bodies that each ingredient was made in a halaal way. Malaysia-based DagangHalaal has made a business from that complexity by establishing an online database of halaal certificates to ease their exchange and expedite the process for applicants. As of February, it said 38 out of over 120 certification bodies worldwide had signed up. The company, which also runs a halaal e-commerce site, reported 2015 revenue of 5.6 million Malaysian ringgit ($1.4 million), up 64 percent year-on-year. It raised 3.6 million pounds ($4.7 million) from this year's London stock listing, and is betting that halaal cosmetics will gain traction beyond their current strongholds of Indonesia and Malaysia. “halaal certification is a requirement that might be put in place by other countries in the future,” Joerg Karas, general manager of Schwan-Stabilo Cosmetics, said in a statement last month. The German company, which is ready to offer halaal-certified products to customers such as L'Oreal and Procter & Gamble, said it is “well-equipped for this niche market”. Non-halaal products will remain available in Indonesia following the labelling law, but may meet a backlash. “The average Muslim consumer in Indonesia is not going to buy something that effectively says prohibited on it,” said Abdalhamid Evans of halaal consultancy firm Imarat Consultants. Unilever, which owns five of Indonesia's top 10 beauty and personal care brands, says all nine of its factories there already meet halaal standards and that it is currently working with third-party suppliers of imported ingredients. Alan Jope, who runs Unilever's personal care business from Singapore, told Reuters the cost of certification was “not material”. Muslim values Competition with homegrown rivals steeped in local tradition can be fierce, especially when it comes to regulation. But Jope said the key for multinationals like Unilever - with global marketing and development teams - is understanding Muslim values generally and how they influence habits in specific markets with different cultures and ethnicities. “Some (values) are common across Muslim countries,” he said, noting that about 90 percent of Muslim consumers say faith influences their brand choices. “But there's quite substantial differences between how a Muslim woman in Indonesia and a Muslim woman in Saudi Arabia express their faith and how that impacts their beauty regimes.” He guessed that one third of the top 20 markets for Unilever's 20 billion euros-per-year business were countries with large Muslim populations, from India to Nigeria. He said better meeting their needs was a top strategic priority. To that end, Unilever has introduced products such as a gel body moisturiser that absorbs quickly beneath long undergarments and a long-lasting toothpaste appealing to those fasting for Ramadaan. Like rival Henkel, it sells a line of shampoo for veiled hair, but Jope said the industry needs to improve its advertising, such as by featuring more women in hijabs. “We need to be doing a better job reflecting Muslim values in our brand communication,” he said.

McIntyre September 11, 2016 9:00 am EST Print Email Tweet Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) have jockeyed for the lead as America’s most valuable company, each with a market cap of about $550 billion. One tech giant vs. another. A look at the top 20 American public corporations reveals several other close comparisons One note is that the top five positions on the market cap table are tech companies, and have left large energy companies behind. After Apple and Alphabet are Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) at $435 billion, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) at $364 billion, and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) at $360 billion. All five companies are trying to play in at least one of the others’ backyards. Microsoft, Amazon, and Google are among the cloud computing leaders. Amazon and Apple continue to fight each other for dominance in the streaming media market. Microsoft, Apple, and Alphabet are all in the mobile OS market. The only company on the list without a significant challenger is Facebook, one of the reasons its market cap is so high. Exxon Mobile (NYSE: XOM) is tied with Amazon in market cap, at $360 billion. Chevron (NYSE: CVX) is also on the list at $191 billion. Big oil has not been entirely kicked off the list Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is on the list at $217 billion. Investors in rival Amazon and Walmart cannot help noting how far bricks and mortars have fallen behind e-commerce. Walmart is trying to catch up, piecemeal, most recently with its $3 billion buyout of Jet.com. Two major banks are on the list, with market caps fairly close to one another. JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) at $240 billion and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) at $245 billion. And, finally the two largest phone companies and wireless providers in the U.S. AT&T (NYSE: T) at $244 billion, and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) at $211 billion (Notably, no car companies are on the list, a departure from decades ago Top 20 market cap companies, courtesy of The Online Investor Large Cap Company                       Ticker    Market Cap ($in billions) Apple Inc                                          AAPL      555.71 Alphabet Inc                                    GOOGL     541.90 Alphabet Inc                                    GOOG      522.09 Microsoft Corporation                   MSFT      438.02 Facebook Inc                                   FB        364.99 Amazon.com Inc.                          AMZN      360.36 Exxon Mobil Corp.                       XOM       360.10 Johnson & Johnson                     JNJ       323.46 General Electric Co                      GE        269.82 Wells Fargo & Co.                        WFC       245.82 AT&T Inc                                       T         244.30 JPMorgan Chase & Co                  JPM       240.74 Procter & Gamble Co.                   PG        230.21 Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.                   WMT       217.46 Verizon Communications Inc             VZ        211.23 Pfizer Inc                                         PFE       206.84 Visa Inc                                            V         191.94 Chevron Corporation                     CVX       191.05 Berkshire Hathaway Inc                 BRK.B     188.03 Coca-Cola Co (The)                        KO        182.44 By Douglas A.

RELATED COMPANIES EXPAND ADD TO Portfolio Watchlist OUTLOOK? +ve -ve Colgate x Loading data... ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ From yoga to activism to business, Baba Ramdev shares his company Patanjali's plans to turn cow protection into a viable business. He talks of his dream world-class university project and rapport with PM Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah. How interested are you in politics? I have no interest. I simply want the country to have good rulers, a stable political system. I have no political ambitions. Do you plan to contest elections? I will never contest elections. I will stand by this till my last breath. If I wanted to join politics, I could have formed a party with over a hundred prominent politicians supporting me. Do you see yourself more in the role of a raj guru? Whatever I have done till now is to serve the people. Whatever I have got has been a by-product of this - wealth, name, fame or an empire which many claim I have built. Let me reiterate, none of this is mine. If power gets attached to me as a by-product, I will never use it for anything wrong. The PM is extremely dear to me but I have never misused our relationship for my benefit. You say you're not satisfied with the Centre's steps to bring back black money stashed abroad... More efforts could have been made. This is not a criticism. It is everybody's expectation. How do you rate Narendra Modi's tenure as PM till now? I have stopped giving ratings. It unnecessarily fuels controversy (laughs). One must tell the truth - if a sanyasi will not tell the truth, who else will? But it should not harm the nation. I will say a few things about Modiji. A leader should do three things for the country - ensure internal and external security, develop and execute good policies, and maintain good relations with other countries. Modiji is doing well in all these areas. He works 18 hours a day. We should let him continue the work he is doing. You have no constructive suggestions for the government... If there is any, I will give it directly (laughs). When Modiji listens to me, Amit Shah listens to me, why should I go about giving suggestions here and there? When the government listens to you, why create noise on the road? Have you given any advice recently? I keep on giving advice whenever asked. You've supported, been part of Anna Hazare's movement, do you feel Arvind Kejriwal lived up to expectations? I avoid political questions nowadays. I'm focused on yoga, ayurveda, vedic education and service. I'll raise issues of a political nature whenever a big crisis faces the nation. When things are going well, why do it? In case of a crisis, I'll definitely stand up for the country . Your views on gau rakshak vigilantism? Mere sloganeering won't accomplish gau raksha. There are people doing good work in this area.They should be encouraged. If the government can spend crores on teerth yatras and Haj, why can't it spend on cow protection? There should be a gaushala policy at the state and central level, and research in this field. We are already doing it. We have allocated Rs 500 crore for this and will spend more if required. As far as the practical applications of gau raksha are concerned, we have products like gaunyle, a substitute for phenyle. We are starting a dairy with a capacity of 10 lakh litres of milk daily. If people use cow-related products, it will lead to cow protection. As far as technology to enable this is concerned, we are working on it through breed selection, embryo transplantation and semen selection to improve the quality of cows. Those spreading terror in the name of gau raksha should be stopped. That is necessary. How do you think such elements can be stopped? The idea should be inculcated that the cow is beyond religion. People should realise that the cow, Gita, Vedas, Ram and Krishna were there before religion came into the world. No religion is beyond 2,500 years old. People should not associate the icons that were before this time with any religion. Till recently, you taught people yoga, advised them to lead a minimalist lifestyle. Now you sell everything, from toothpaste to noodles? Isn't that a turnaround - from yoga to 'bhoga' (consumption)? Whatever is associated with the materialistic world is bhoga in some form. Bhoga literally means bhojan (food). We offer bhoga to god, it does not have a negative connotation. At Patanjali we work for satvik bhoga, not tamsic or rajsik. Some joke that Baba Ramdev will get into beer or wine. That kind of bhoga we will never offer people. Our objective is to offer good quality products, not for our profit but with the objective of seva (service). Patanjali Ayurveda is perhaps the only company in the world that has announced that its profit will not be the property of any individual but based on the principle: prosperity for charity. Acharya Balkrishna owns 97 per cent stake in the company. He has declared he will not take even one rupee from the company's profits. This is satvik seva. Patanjali stores are almost everywhere. Your key to success? Transparency, accountability and responsibility. MNCs have huge advertising budgets and get big celebrities by paying them crores of rupees. I stand in front of the camera and talk about our products. People know I am responsible for the quality of the product. They have been seeing me for 20-25 years, fighting huge battles. They know Baba Ramdev sleeps on the floor and doesn't want anything for himself. Would an MNC CEO stand in front of the camera and take responsibility for his products? People have faith in our brand. The technology we use is no less than that of our competitors, perhaps better. That's why Patanjali is bigger than MNC brands operating in the country. Soon, we'll take Patanjali to greater heights across the world. Our vision is to plough back the profits into charity, especially education. I want 80 per cent of our profits to go into education. Which segments of education? We focus on some core things - health and positive thinking through yoga, Ayurveda, propagating Vedic education and culture with the best of modern education so we build the character of the country's youth. These can be accomplished only if we are self-reliant and confident. We don't expect government to give us resources. Neither do we expect people to donate thousands of crores for this. The extremely rich here are miserly. We don't expect much from them. We have started Acharyakulams - schools that provide a blend of Vedic and modern education to boys and girls. Soon, these schools will become a benchmark for world-class education. I have been working for a Vedic education board which, I am hopeful, will be set up within 2-3 months. This will facilitate education till class XII. Beyond that, I want world class university education in our country. Currently, not even one Indian university is among the world's top 100. That is why, we want to set up a university - its name could either be Vedic University or Aryavrat. It will aim to be among the world's top 100. Its faculty will be top-notch, will impart cutting-edge science and tech education. It will also have Vedic education. That will be its USP. Some business analysts predict your annual turnover will touch Rs 20,000 crore by 2020 but you claim Patanjali is eyeing sales of Rs 50,000 crore in the next few years. Business analysts are not looking at the bigger picture. We are setting up eight mega projects and around 50 small ones in the next couple of years. Sales are expected to cross Rs 50,000 crore from the mega projects alone. People ask me how. I tell them India has unlimited potential, but it's unrecognised. MNCs are trying to tap this. But why should money go out of the country? Are we any less at brand building or marketing? Today, Patanjali's brand value is more than Unilever's. Many say Baba Ramdev is in a hurry to enter too many businesses. How will you ensure quality? If a housewife is careless while cooking, it can cause food poisoning in her family. But food cooked for 10,000 can be eaten safely if it's hygienic. Our entire process - from raw material procurement to finished good - is done through a world-class infrastructure. Some 200 scientists work at Patanjali. They ensure quality. We also conduct animal and human trials. Patanjali Research Institute laboratories and our central lab compete with the best in the country. In our purchasing department, there is no corruption. If we claim we put Kashmiri kesar or swarna bhasma (gold ash) in a product, rest assured these are being used. Come and check. We have responsible people who ensure quality. I take responsibility for quality as Patanjali's brand ambassador. Is Patanjali a one-man show? If decisions are being taken by me or Acharya Balkrishna, that doesn't imply a one-man show. If 100 people become chaudhary and take decisions, nothing will ever get done. You will then call it a policy paralysis. Having said that, I am also not the decision maker. We are only god's instruments - for the benefit of people. If people want to criticise, let them do so every day. This will enable us to put our version before people. One rarely hears about others who have made the brand a success. We have professionals from Unilever, P&G and Colgate and many top scientists. Many were working elsewhere for a package of over Rs 1 crore. They took salary cuts to join us. I have never hidden names of those working with us. Our sales head is Balram Singh Khushwaha, supply chain head is Sanjeev Khanna. Operations head is Sant Bahadur Singh. They come from all communities, religions and castes. Today, 1 lakh people get regular employment and 1 crore are indirectly employed with Patanjali. Our effort is to employ 5 crore directly and give indirect benefits to another 5 crore. Is there a succession plan? Our organisation will never be run by a family . We have a team of yogis - more than 500. My guru Acharya Pradyumn has trained them like I was trained. We'll train at least 5,000 such yogis so that the future of Patanjali is secure. What do you do in your spare time? I don't get much spare time. I've never watched a movie. I watch TV news at times, for 15 to 30 minutes. What is your day like? I usually rise before 4 AM. By 4.30 AM, I am at my daily yoga session. I meditate for two hours. At least four to five hours are spent on Patanjali Ayurveda, another four to five in interacting with people. I eat very light - anjeer or a juice for breakfast, light vegetables for lunch and dinner. For 18 years, I lived only on milk and fruits. I've started taking other food now. What legacy do you want to leave behind? I want to be remembered as Baba Ramdev. A person wears many hats. I am a farmer, yogi, teacher, public speaker, activist, economist, vaidya. There are so many things I do simultaneously. But at the core, I am a karma yogi sanyasi. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!
