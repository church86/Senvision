It’s a huge mistake’ Leon co-founder John Vincent started out at Procter & Gamble, before moving to global consulting firm, Bain and Company Credit: Jon Cartwright/Leon Anna Isaac 3 October 2016 • 6:00pm John Vincent, Leon's co-founder and chief executive, talks to Anna Isaac about his business background, what motivates him, and the pros and cons of leaving the EU. What’s your business background? I’m a child of the 1980s from north London. Growing up there, it was all about commerce; I had lots of Asian, Greek and Turkish friends. Many of my school friends’ parents had set up small businesses. It was a very entrepreneurial environment. You also had people such as Richard Branson, who one looked at and thought: “They have fun lives.” At university I set up an entertainment production company – power distribution, bands, DJs and so on. This was the early years of dance music in 1989. It was a great way to marry business and fun. Then I started out at Procter & Gamble (P&G). My job was to take a box of products around different chemists, restock their supplies and reorder. It was character building, but it wasn’t interesting. And there was one thing I hated about working at P&G: the advertising process. Step one involved creating the fear factor, which was a bit like saying: “Isn’t it awful when your friend comes around and your kitchen is dirty?” I didn’t want to create fear or encourage shame. I left to join [global consulting firm] Bain and Company, where I worked for seven years. I worked on taking businesses apart, and then putting them back together. You learned to understand strategy, finance and operations. I was in the machine at P&G, but at Bain, I was on the outside, working as a consultant to the board or chief executive for companies in a range of industries. How did Leon get started? I decided that I had spent too much time dreaming about it. It was time to go and do my own thing. So I sat down with a colleague of mine at the time, Henry Dimbleby, and we decided to write down five business ideas each. Good fast food was common on both lists. Henry had a vision of doing it in bowls. I had a vision of doing it more like McDonald’s. Eventually we decided to go down the McDonald’s route. The idea was simple: “If God did fast food.” That dictated everything: where we would be on the high street; the format of the kitchen; the freshness and flavour of the ingredients; and the fact that employees smile because they want to. We started out on Carnaby Street, London, right in the thick of the competition. We were next to a Starbucks and a Pret. We were lucky, because we hit upon something people really wanted – good fast food. What’s your inspiration? There’s a great book called Mastery by George Leonard, and another called The Great Work of Your Life, by Stephen Cope. What they both say between them is that happiness and fulfillment comes from becoming really good at something, honing it, mastering it, and then giving up the fruits. Lots of people come into business for money. It’s a huge mistake. If that’s your focus, then you will fall off balance. If you’re able to master something and encourage your team to master it too, you’re on the right path. You need positivity and purpose.   There are people on superyachts, such as Sir Philip Green. Do you think he’s happy, when he’s being hounded by the press because of pensions? Some people pursue money at all costs and it catches up with them in a very biblical, Shakespearian way.   The stereotypes of what makes a businessperson: CCTV at a big house in Surrey, and driving a Maserati. That’s not true happiness. We need to break down this concept of the union and workers over here – and the fat cats over there. We all should want to delight in communities and achievement. What are your views on Brexit? It could bring a lot of opportunities. It’s already bringing a much greater sense of accountability and self-responsibility in the UK. But I have concerns about being able to hire and retain staff. The impact [of the referendum result] on the team was that they were very upset. They felt – in many cases – that it was a signal that they [as immigrants] were not welcome. They were worried about being able to stay. A huge part of what my staff enjoy is the fact that there’s a real cultural richness among employees at Leon. I don’t want to compromise that. It’s a very Mediterranean brand. I want to be able to employ people who can project and understand that – people from Italy, the south of France and so on. We still don’t know – and the government won’t tell us – what the immigration situation is going to be. Since Brexit our ability to recruit has been weakened. We’re now struggling to hire enough people when we open a new store. Why have you sought to diversify, with cookbooks, cookware and so on, alongside fast food? It’s about brand definition. Our mission is to make it easier for everyone to eat and live well. Things such as sharing recipes, helping out with school food, offering cookware and so on, is all part of that. But focus, for businesses, is always paramount. Growth comes from focus and repeatability, and to do that you need a clear mission. Someone else setting up a restaurant perhaps shouldn’t do the same thing as we have at Leon; it’s about what’s right for them. It’s about their passion. They might say they’re a restauranter and a tech master, in which case they should follow that route. Go with your capabilities and your mission.

PHOTO | FILE  In Summary The Procter & Gamble product, having spoofed itself for years with advice on how to become more “mantastic,” posts to its 2.6 million Facebook followers a steady stream of video games, prize entries, and advertisements as short as two seconds. Advertisement New York. Almost 80 years old, the deodorant Old Spice is learning new tricks for finding customers in the era of smartphones and social media. The Procter & Gamble product, having spoofed itself for years with advice on how to become more “mantastic,” posts to its 2.6 million Facebook followers a steady stream of video games, prize entries, and advertisements as short as two seconds. Creating “thumb-stopping” content is the goal, and marketers are doing everything they can to achieve it. That includes using neuroscience to study which visual and audio cues offer the best bet to grabbing and keeping an impatient smartphone user’s attention. Estimates show that the average person looks at his or her smartphone as much as 150 times a day. The attention is there, but it’s just not long-lived. “You get the three-second audition,” said Frank Amorese, media director at Heineken USA. “If you are relying on the 14th or 15th second to do the heavy lifting of the ad, it’s not going to work.” Advertisers are in a dizzying race to connect with customers as new mobile-borne social media platforms emerge and evolve. “The landscape changes every six months,” Amorese said. “It’s changing at an increasingly fast rate.” Digital ad spending is projected to reach $72.1 billion in 2016, growing at a rate of 21 per cent and now comprising almost 37 per cent of the overall market, according to eMarketer. Social media accounts for $15.4 billion of this. Heineken has doubled its spending on digital ads to 30 per cent over the last five years. The dominance of smaller mobile devices has heightened the challenge of capturing the attention of potential shoppers. Ads must be tailored depending on whether they are being seen on a widescreen television, a tablet or a smartphone and must not demand too much time if a consumer is merely glancing at a feed and not planning on a lengthy stay. “We have to really identify how do consumers engage with every single platform and then what is the creative experience we need to give them,” said P&G chief brand officer Marc Pritchard at the four-day Advertising Week conference in New York this week. “But it also has to look like one brand because people have 5,000 ads coming at them every day and that’s 10 times what it was just 10 years ago.” Anna Fieler, chief marketing officer at PopSugar, a women’s shopping and content site, said marketers are devising benchmarks like “sharing velocity” to monitor resonance. “Shareability is the gold standard of how engaged people are,” she said. “People like it so much that they want to share it with someone else.” Not all Ads place the brand front and center. Frito-Lay, which spends about 40 per cent of its advertising budget on digital media, offers tips on its Facebook feed on professional mentoring and networking, in addition to the usual fare of ads that aim to excite and amuse. “People are using social media to build their (personal) brand,” said Jeff Klein, vice president of brands and portfolio marketing. Sometimes Frito-Lay just “takes a little bit of a back seat.” Much of the buzz at the Advertising Week conference was the wildfire growth of video streaming and broadcast of live events. Facebook vice president Will Platt-Higgins predicted video could comprise 80 per cent of all smartphone content by 2020. “You’ve got the perfect marriage of basically a supercomputer, which is in your pocket, plus super powerful wifi, plus a video composer and a high-definition camera,” he said. “All of that together creates the perfect storm for all of us to upload videos like crazy and that’s what’s happening.” (AFP) advertisement In The Headlines 7  hours ago Student loan beneficiaries in for more shock, surprise Higher education loan beneficiaries were in for more surprises yesterday, with some  claiming 6  hours ago Congestion at rapid transit bus stations raises concern City commuters will have to contend with congestion at rapid transit bus stations for much longer News Tanzania seeks ICC reforms   6  hours ago News JPM signs contentious Media Bill into law   6  hours ago International Prince William warns of looming threat of extinction   1 day ago International Fake US election news outshone real on Facebook: report   1 day ago Advertisement Political Reforms WARAH: Making angels out of Africa’s rogue leaders Opinion/Editorial FROM THE PUBLIC EDITOR'S DESK: Scribes’ dilemma: to be or not to be objective Opinion/Editorial WHAT OTHERS SAY: Is Kenya really exceptional in E.Africa?

COTY, +0.43% including the transfer of its global fine fragrances, salon professional, cosmetics and retail hair color businesses, along with select hair styling brands (collectively referred to as “P&G Specialty Beauty Brands”). On September 30, 2016, P&G completed a split-off transaction whereby P&G provided its shareholders with the opportunity to exchange their shares of P&G common stock for Galleria Co. common stock. Effective October 1, 2016, Galleria Co. merged with a subsidiary of Coty and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Coty, whereby Galleria Co. common stock was converted to common stock of Coty Inc. "The completion of this transaction is a key step in our journey to return P&G results to a balance of strong top-line growth, bottom-line growth and cash generation," said David S. Taylor, P&G Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “This effectively completes the major work we undertook two years ago to streamline and strengthen our product portfolio. We are now focused on 10 product categories and about 65 brands where P&G has leading market positions and where product technologies deliver performance differences that matter most to consumers.” “I'm pleased with the timely, efficient and effective transition of these businesses. I want to share my personal thanks to all the employees who have transitioned to Coty,” Taylor added. “They showed amazing dedication during a period of uncertainty—demonstrating time and time again the strong character of P&G people. I thank them for everything they did during the transition and for all their years with P&G and wish them an exciting future with Coty.” As part of the transaction, P&G retired 105.0 million shares of P&G stock, behind the exchange of 409.7 million shares of Galleria Co., which converted into common shares of Coty. At P&G’s closing stock price on Friday, September 30 of $89.75, these shares represent value of $9.4 billion. In addition, Galleria Co. assumed approximately $1.9 billion of debt in the transaction, the proceeds of which were subsequently distributed to P&G prior to the consummation of the split/merger. The combination of the stock retirement and debt proceeds results in a total value of approximately $11.4 billion. Goldman, Sachs & Co. acted as financial advisor, Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP acted as tax counsel, and Jones Day acted as legal counsel to P&G.

And it was not just the campaign itself that departed from the norm, as the Japanese brand brought in a Swedish agency which in turn worked with a Danish partner on media strategy. (For more, read Warc's exclusive report: SK-II Marriage Takeover: How a Japanese skin care brand cut through in China.) My Troedsson, Planner at Forsman & Bodenfors in Sweden, told Warc how the brief – which tasked the agency with creating buzz, strengthening emotional connections and breaking the category language – had taken a long time to properly understand, but that once the team came across the phenomenon of sheng nu (the 'leftover woman'), they seized on it. This is the term given to women who reach the age of 27 without getting married, and whose parents post ads describing them on public display in 'marriage markets'. "The fact we came from outside enabled us to see this in a totally new way," explained Troedsson, as she outlined the disconnect between the traditional expectations of parents and the very different desires of women in today's fast-changing China. "Everyone feels really pressured – parents and daughters – but they don't really talk about it and they feel very alone," she said. That insight, along with research that revealed the target audience wanted to hear about more than just rational product benefits, indicated the direction for the campaign. "We wanted to make use of the fact that no prestige skin care competitor had an emotional and values-driven communication approach," said Troedsson. And the marriage market gave them "a symbolic way to make a statement". An installation in Shanghai's People's Park replaced the dating ads with personalised messages from single women declaring that their independence made them happy; a film focusing on four women and their parents was widely shared on social media both inside and outside the country and generated global media coverage The result has been "a clear increase in sales both in-store and online and an increase in the inflow of new customers", Troedsson reported. But perhaps more importantly, she added, "the ultimate goal is to celebrate women, whatever their personal choices may be, and make them feel valued and appreciated".

Mayor Betsy Hodges, Dr. Michael Lomax, president and CEO of UNCF, and Target Executive Vice President Laysha Ward. On September 27 the Minneapolis Convention Center hosted the United Negro College Fund Empower Me Tour sponsored by Fed Ex and Proctor & Gamble and presented by Target. The UNCF Empower Me Tour, created in 2008 by Wells Fargo, brings Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) to the Minneapolis-St Paul area. The tour provides on-site college admission, scholarship awards, and workshops with the goal of empowering students and parents with the tools to pursue, continue and complete a college degree. “Target is really excited and honored to support UNCF and the Empower Me Tour,” said Target Executive Vice President Laysha Ward, the company’s chief corporate social responsibility officer. “We have supported UNCF for 20 years. We know education is a pathway out of poverty and into economic opportunity. By tackling education, we can help be a part of the solution.” According to Ward, Target returns five percent of its profits back to the community, equaling $4 million weekly nationwide. “It is very important we hold this event,” said Sharon Smith Akinsanya, regional development director of UNCF, whose role is to make sure enough money is available to assist low-income students in pursuing higher education in Minnesota. “We have major disparities not only in the state, but the nation.” Thousands of high school students from the Minneapolis and St. Paul school districts and surrounding areas attended the event to receive information regarding HBCUs. The students also attended workshops of empowerment regarding perceived barriers of beauty for young women called “Girl Talk,” presented by Target Vice President Caroline Wanga, poet and youth engager of CoolSpeak Natasha Carrizosa, and Hampton University graduate and Miss HBVS LaQuayle Argurs. __________________________________________________________________________________________________ “Our future depends on getting it right for all of our kids, but especially our children of color.” __________________________________________________________________________________________________ There were also workshops that focused on overcoming barriers as young Black men. They included testimonies by creator of the nonprofit Tied to Greatness Dr. Alex Ellis, CEO of Harvest Network of Schools Eric Mahmoud, Chief Inclusion Officer James Burroughs, and 2014 Hampton University graduate Kyle G. Mason. Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges expressed the importance of Minneapolis being a location for the UNCF Empower Me Tour because of having “the worst disparities in the nation between Black and White students. Our future depends on getting it right for all of our kids, but especially our children of color. The United Negro College Fund has been dedicated to making sure that young children succeed. “One of the great trends happening in Minneapolis is that we are becoming more diverse over time,” continued Hodges. “Even before I was mayor I knew the value of UNCF and what they do. But as mayor I can see it at work on the ground, giving young people an imagination for an educational future that can set them up for the rest of their lives.” An article published last year in the Washington Post by Valerie Strauss indicated the enrollment at many HBCUs such as Shaw University, South Carolina State, Tuskegee, Virginia State University, Dillard and Florida Memorial University have seen enrollment jumps of 29 percent or more. These institutions are depending on overflow housing to adjust to the growth of enrollment.

Mayor Betsy Hodges, Dr. Michael Lomax, president and CEO of UNCF and Target Executive Vice President Laysha Ward. Dr. Michael L. Lomax,, said when the Empower Me Tour was first created eight years ago it was solely focused on financial literacy, targeting high school and college students. “Over the eight years, we re-engineered the program for the focus of high school students to become college-ready and helping college students become career-ready,” Dr. Lomax told the MSR. In addition to the tour awarding $1.5 million in scholarships to Twin Cities students who attended the Empower Me Tour last year, Dr. Lomax reported that UNCF is very focused on academic preparation. “We really focus on ‘Are you taking the right courses and preparing yourself for some post-secondary education?’ We know some students will go on to community college or apprenticeship programs, but our main [goal and message] is education is going to be a part of your preparation regardless.” Nationwide, the UNCF Empower Me Tour awards 10,000 scholarships and internships in just under 400 programs to its 37 Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Those awarded scholarships from the Twin Cities graduate at a rate of 81.9 percent. Lomax explained, “The name of the tour is the Empower Me Tour, suggesting there is a psychological and social impact of the program as well, giving young people the sense [that] they can take ownership of their lives. As daunting and confusing as the journey may be, they can own that journey and drive it toward the goals they want to achieve.” The Empower Me Tour that kicked off in Minneapolis will continue on to three more cities:  Chicago, IL, Oakland, CA and Rochester, NY.   For more information regarding the UNCF Empower Me Tour, visit them on Facebook at UNCFEmpowerMeTour #UNCFEmpowerMeTour on Instagram and @EmpowerMeTour #EmpowerMeTour on Twitter.

The research study covers the present scenario and growth prospects of the global female depilatory marketfor 2016-2020. To calculate the market size, the report considers the revenue generated from the retail and salon sales of female depilatory products and equipment to individual customers in the global market. Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=52528 Technavio's sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. Technavio consumer and retail analysts highlight the following four factors that are contributing to the growth of the global female depilatory market: Product innovation and line extension by vendors Consumer emphasis on personal grooming and hygiene Increased demand for do-it-yourself (DIY) hair removal methods Increase in number of working women leveraging demand for personal grooming Product innovation and line extension by vendors Marketers of depilatory products launch new products to enhance safety and faster way of depilation. The major reason behind that is to gain consumer interest by addressing consumer needs for quick, complete and longer-lasting hair removal. For instance, in 2015, P&G, introduced Gillette Flexball innovation in a razor exclusively for women, the 'Venus Swirl'. The handle of this razor is fitted with a ball-hinge that allows the razor to rotate and provide a clean shave, particularly on body parts like the knees and ankles. P&G sold more than 2.5 million of these razors in the US in 2015. In addition, since the launch of this line in January 2015, Venus brand's share of women's system razors in the US increased by four points and reached to 64% during the end of the same period. Additionally, marketers of the hair removal cream and shave gel segment are diversifying their product lines to meet the wide range of requirements set by the large base of consumers. These include hair removal creams based on the part of the body (legs, bikini line, face, arms, underarms), skin type (normal, sensitive, dry), and desired effect (long-lasting and quick results). Such launches provide more choices and help gauge consumer preferences. Consumer emphasis on personal grooming and hygiene According to Brijesh Kumar Choubey, a lead analyst at Technavio for cosmetics and toiletry research, "Increasing emphasis on personal hygiene and grooming is likely to drive the market for depilatory products over the forecast period." For instance, in the US, a woman spends an average of USD 45 per month on beauty products. The Hispanics form a major part of the beauty industry. In 2015, this population segment spent over 3% more on shaving products than it did in 2014. Similarly, spending by this group on personal care products increased by over 4% from that of 2014. In key developing markets like India, demand for personal care products has grown significantly during the period 2010-2015. Increased demand for do-it-yourself (DIY) hair removal methods The preference for salons is decreasing in developed markets such as Germany, France, the US, the UK, Japan, Canada, and Australia, particularly for regular use, with people increasingly preferring cost-effective do-it-yourself (DIY) methods of removal of unwanted body hair. Hair removal creams and waxes gained considerable popularity during 2010-2015, with many brands offering skin moisturizing and smoothening effects and slower and reduced hair growth. DIY kits are also available to cater to consumers' on-the-go requirements. Products like and the Tweezerman Mini Slant Tweezer and the Helix Threadease Hair Removal System, priced between USD10-15, are affordable options and can easily fit in makeup boxes. Other popular DIY products include the Sally Hansen's Microwavable Eyebrow, Face Lip Wax Kit and Ouch-Relief Stripless Hard Wax Kit, and Ouch-Relief Wax Strip Kit for Face. Increase in number of working women leveraging demand for personal grooming The working population segment is one of the major revenue contributors to the global beauty market. Working women account for a significant share of the total revenue generated in the global female depilatory products market. Globally, more than 55% of the total female population aged between 15-64 years comprised the female labor force in 2014. "This increasing number of working women has created considerable opportunity for depilatory product marketers to grow. They are focusing more on regular or frequently usable depilatory products as well as epilators and electric hair removal systems that provide a quick and smooth solution on a daily basis," says Brijesh. Epilators that have become popular in the global market include Braun Silk-épil epilators, Gillette Venus Silk-expert IPL powered by Braun from P&G and Veet Infini'Silk and Veet Infini'Silk PRO from Reckitt-Benckiser.

Business P&G under pressure as eco-friendly products surge Proctor & Gamble Luke Sharrett / Bloomberg Procter & Gamble Co. (P&G) Tide brand laundry detergent inside a Costco Wholesale Corp. store in Nashville, Tennessee, on Friday, Sept. 25, 2015. Procter & Gamble Co. (P&G) Tide brand laundry detergent inside a Costco Wholesale Corp. store in Nashville, Tennessee, on Friday, Sept. 25, 2015. (Luke Sharrett / Bloomberg) Sarah VeryBloomberg Procter & Gamble Co., which is losing market share to eco-friendly products, is under mounting pressure to either fend off the competitors or buy one of them. The maker of Tide and Crest is struggling to maintain its position in key categories, including skin care, razor blades and laundry detergent. Companies with so-called sustainable brands — products that are seen as more natural, environmentally sensitive or purpose-driven — are chipping away at P&G's longstanding hold on American households. Though P&G remains the world's largest consumer-products company, its wares don't have the same maverick appeal as newer brands. Unilever, P&G's top competitor, raised the stakes last month when it agreed to acquire Seventh Generation, a Vermont-based company that makes sustainable cleaning products. The company had previously acquired Dollar Shave Club — another startup targeting America's bathroom cabinets — and expressed interest in Honest Co., the household-products company co-founded by actress Jessica Alba. Billion Dollar Shave Club: L.A. start-up is purchased by Unilever for a staggering sum Shan Li, David Pierson One of the darlings of the Los Angeles’ start-up scene is cashing in on a $1-billion payday — a rise fueled by a disruptive business model and a series of offbeat viral ads. But this company does not traffic in virtual reality headsets, video games or disappearing messages. Its business, instead,... One of the darlings of the Los Angeles’ start-up scene is cashing in on a $1-billion payday — a rise fueled by a disruptive business model and a series of offbeat viral ads. But this company does not traffic in virtual reality headsets, video games or disappearing messages. Its business, instead,... (Shan Li, David Pierson) The situation may lead to a broader hunt for other sustainable acquisitions, said Philip Gorham, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. Buying a brand like Honest Co. or Method Products — assuming those businesses can be acquired — could help P&G appeal to younger consumers. "The consumer products industry is going niche," he said. "Any number of the multinational consumer product manufacturers would want companies like Honest Co. and Method Products in their portfolio." P&G's sales in core categories have slipped in recent months. Its share of the U.S. skin care market fell to 12.7 percent in September, down from 14.2 percent in July, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, which cited IRI retail data. And the company, which owns Gillette, is facing a declining market for razor blades. At the same time, Dollar Shave's smaller rival, Harry's, has been gaining share. That company recently began selling at Target stores, further squeezing P&G. P&G just sold 41 beauty brands to New York-based Coty Inc., a deal that closed on Monday. But the company may soon return to acquisition mode. Chief Executive Officer David Taylor signaled on a conference call in August that P&G will rely on deals to fill out its product portfolio. "Am I open to M&A bolt-on acquisitions that we think are strategic and would help accelerate the growth in any of our 10 core categories? The answer is clearly yes," he said. Champagne, tacos and time off: How Dollar Shave Club employees are celebrating $1-billion sale Shan Li Alex Janckila, a software engineer at Dollar Shave Club, was sporting something a bit unusual for an employee of a razor company: a five o’clock shadow. “There was happy hour every hour,” Janckila said with a sheepish grin, one hand clutching a large bottle of electrolyte water. “I was happy for...

(Shan Li) Damon Jones, a spokesman for Cincinnati-based P&G, declined to comment on its acquisition strategy. Unilever, meanwhile, has been more aggressive in snapping up nontraditional brands. It agreed to acquire Dollar Shave Club in July in a deal that was said to be worth about $1 billion. Unilever then set its sights on Seventh Generation, announcing plans to purchase that company in September. The buying spree raised questions about other brands in the category. Unilever has also discussed an acquisition of Honest Co., according to a person familiar with that matter. But Honest Co. may push ahead with a plan for an initial public offering. The startup has been working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley on a possible IPO, people familiar with the matter said earlier this year. Since Alba helped start Honest Co. in 2011, the company has branched out from natural baby products to home cleaning and beauty items. Honest Co. has gotten a foothold in stores such as Target and Whole Foods Market Inc., but it's also faced challenges. Honest Co. was the target of a class-action lawsuit filed last year in which customers claimed its products were deceptively labeled and contained unnatural ingredients. Eco-friendly products typically carry a premium over traditional cleaners and hygiene items — a key advantage at a time when supermarket prices are getting squeezed. Consumers are often willing to pay about 20 percent more for sustainable products, according to Bill Harrison, head of consumer investment banking at Headwaters. The market for sustainable personal health products alone could be worth $117 billion, his firm estimates. But there's always the chance that smaller brands don't want to be acquired by a consumer-products behemoth. Take Method, the San Francisco-based company that sells green cleaners. It agreed to a merger with Belgium's Ecover in 2012 because the companies seemed to have the same philosophy. Drew Fraser, CEO of Method, says Seventh Generation's deal with Unilever was quite different. "By becoming part of Unilever — a company that isn't built on the same philosophy — Seventh Generation risks alienating its current customer base," he said in an e-mail. "Customers in our category want to buy and support brands aligned with their values, so joining Unilever's portfolio may feel disjointed to Seventh Generation's consumers." These concerns may make it difficult for P&G to buy its way into the hearts of sustainable-product shoppers. Instead, the company may need to focus on rehabilitating its own brands, said Ali Dibadj, an analyst from Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. "P&G is still trying to get its house in order," Dibadj said.

The Daily Texan does not guarantee their accuracy. Published on October 4, 2016 at 12:59 am Last update on October 5, 2016 at 6:50 pm By Laura Zhang Shameika Wilmington’s scientific curiosity was sparked in the 1990s when she first looked through a telescope she received as a Christmas gift. Over 20 years later, she continues to explore her passion as a regulatory affairs scientist at Procter & Gamble and an advocate for women and minorities in STEM, or science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields.  Wilmington, who graduated from UT in 2016 with a Ph.D. in biochemistry, uses her degree to make sure household and personal care products comply with government regulations around the world.  While Wilmington does not directly work in a lab, her knowledge of biochemistry helps her communicate and collaborate with scientists who do. She said she must understand the science behind the products in order to help them meet federal regulations. “Science has its own language, and you realize this if you sit in the lab and talk to grad students,” Wilmington said. “They have their own language, and the same thing applies in industry. We have a language we are speaking, and the basis of it is science.” As a graduate student at UT, Wilmington worked in the biochemistry lab of molecular biosciences professor Andreas Matouschek. His lab studies and regulates the biological cellular processes of proteins by understanding the complement of protein synthesis which is protein degradation. Wilmington took a new angle and targeted the proteins that already existed by molding her project around the mechanism of protein degradation. According to Matouschek, this project made the lab much more collaborative, bringing in researchers from other fields, such as chemistry.  “She really had to do a lot of creative and original things,” Matouschek said. “It took a lot of initiative and independence and courage [to do things the lab doesn’t normally do].” At UT, Wilmington also served as a science and research mentor for high school students through an outreach program with Austin Regional Science Festival. One of her mentees, Shazma Khan, is now a biology and public health junior at UT.  Khan said working with Wilmington, a minority woman in STEM, changed her preconceived archetype of who scientists are. According to Khan, Wilmington’s ability to explain technical jargon and relate to Khan convinced her to pursue research. “For me, I had that stereotype with scientists and lab work, where I just thought of a guy who was socially awkward and very preoccupied with what was in his petri dish,” Khan said. “So the fact that I had Shameika, who’s a minority woman and really fun to talk to and the opposite of what I was expecting, was a breath of fresh air.” Khan said it is crucial to shatter prejudices in STEM fields where the lack of diversity is apparent, especially in tenure faculty and science leadership. According to Khan, although the number of women and minorities in STEM is increasing, unconscious bias still remains. “I’m in this group project in lab and there’s this one guy who doesn’t let anyone else do anything, so everyone’s like ‘OK, whatever,’” Khan said. “But if I were that person who started doing everything, everyone would label me as annoying and a control freak, whereas for him he’s ‘confident’ and ‘taking initiative.’” Wilmington said she continues outreach efforts, hoping to inspire other young scientists. One time, she was judging a poster competition when a young girl around nine years old came up to her.  “[This girl came up to me and said], ‘Are you one of the scientists?’ and I said yes, so she grabs her mom and says, ‘Mom, she’s a scientist!’” Wilmington said. “That moment, I will never forget, because I got used to myself as a scientist. But for this young girl, me coming up to her … was something different. It was something she needed to question, and it got her really excited.” According to Wilmington, mentoring women and minority scientists in STEM is crucial to advancing the field as a whole. “Yes, I know I’m underrepresented,” Wilmington said. “But at the same time, that’s why my representation is so important.”  View the discussion thread.

This has already proven good in the short term, but could be even better in the long term. Seth McNew (TMFMcNew) Oct 3, 2016 at 6:03PM Image source: Procter & Gamble. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) officially completed the sale of 41 beauty brands to competitor Coty (NYSE:COTY) on Sept. 30, a deal that has been inked since summer 2015. The deal had far more investor interest than was anticipated, and P&G stock hit an all-time high of $90 per share on that day. Here's why the deal was a success in the short term, but looks even better in the long term. The final sale Image source: CoverGirl.com. The $11.4 billion deal was a stock swap between the two companies in which P&G investors were allowed to choose if they wanted to tender all or part of their shares into the new company, called Galleria, that will later convert to shares of Coty stock. In the swap, P&G sold off most of its fragrances, salon, cosmetics, and hair-color businesses, including big-name brands like CoverGirl and Clairol. Coty will also take over eight P&G factories and around 10,000 workers, as well as about $2 billion in debt. P&G needed its shareholders to offer up about 100 million shares for conversion, and to make sure it reached that goal, priced the offer at a 7% discount of what the Coty shares were selling for that day. Shareholders combined offered more than 691 million P&G shares for the requested tender -- far more than expected or needed. Now that the sale is complete, P&G will accept the tender offer of about 105 million shares for a total value (including the debt portion) of $11.4 billion. Why the beauty segment was on the chopping block At one point, P&G owned nearly 170 brands. To spur faster earnings growth, management initiated regrowth strategy in 2014 with one overarching goal -- streamlining operations to focus only on the brands with the highest earnings value. Many brands have already been sold off, including some big names like Duracell batteries, which went to Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) earlier this year.  The chart below shows how each of P&G's five segments performed in fiscal year 2016, which ended June 30. P&G's beauty segment was one of its worst-performing areas by sales and organic volume. With this huge sale of brands to Coty, the beauty segment, which was the company's third largest, will become its smallest. By divesting much of this segment, P&G will be able to redirect its efforts, as well as the cash from the deal, to focus on its more successful brands.  Segment Brand Example Total Sales  (FY 2016) Total Sales Growth (YOY) Organic Volume Growth (YOY) Net Earnings Growth From Continuing Operations (YOY) Beauty CoverGirl, Olay $11.5 billion (9%) (2%) (9%) Grooming Gillette $6.8 billion (8%) (2%) (13%) Healthcare Oral-B $7.3 billion (5%) (2%) 7% Fabric and home Tide $20.7 billion (7%) 1% 5% Baby, feminine, and family Pampers $18.5 billion (9% ) (2%) (10%) Data source: P&G fiscal 2016 earnings report. FY = fiscal year. YOY = year over year. Reason to bet on P&G? "Now looking forward, we continue to focus on large opportunities that should be within our control," said Chief Financial Officer Jon R. Moeller in the 2016 year-end earnings call, adding, "executing what is the largest transformation in our company's history: reaccelerating top line growth with strengthened category business models. ... This transformation is aimed at delivering balanced top and bottom line growth and leadership value creation."  So far, P&G's strategy seems to be working, and could get much better from here. Sales for the fiscal year 2016, which ended June 30, dropped from $70 billion to $65 billion as some brands were discontinued, but net income increased 50% year over year. For fiscal year 2017, P&G management has forecast organic sales to grow around 2% companywide, and for earnings per share to grow around 50%. Much of that increase is due to the sale of the 41 brands to Coty. However, with plans for another $10 billion in cost cuts over the next five years, and focusing only on the highest-performing segments, P&G should be able to drive earnings growth for years to come.  Seth McNew has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Reprints Reprints Katy Perry's New Katy Kat Collection Mascara & Matte Lipstick ad Credit: Covergirl/P&G Most Popular Now that Procter & Gamble Co. has divested a big chunk of its beauty business to Coty, the deal appears to leave WPP's Grey in the middle of a somewhat uncomfortable conflict. Grey continues to handle P&G's Pantene hair care, and also handles the CoverGirl, Clairol, Wella retail and some fragrance brands that went to Coty under a spinoff-merger transaction completed today. While there's relatively little competitive overlap between the P&G brands Coty has gotten and the Pantene brand P&G is keeping, there is some. P&G's Pantene and Coty's Wella and Clairol all sell shampoo and conditioner, the latter technically only through professional and salon channels, though diversion means they sometimes end up on shelves of the same retailers carrying Pantene. It's enough proximity to trigger a conflict under P&G's policy, which generally prohibits businesses that compete with or potentially could compete with P&G brands from being handled within the same agency network, though in some cases it's possible to segment the work in different offices of the same agency. With both businesses being global, the latter may be difficult. "We've been in discussions with the agencies for the past several months on how to work through the conflicts, and we're confident we'll be able to achieve the needed separation for competitive considerations," a P&G spokeswoman said in a statement. She added that P&G doesn't expect an immediate change and will "work with the agencies over the course of several additional months on any actions needed to ensure a smooth transition." It's less clear if the deal creates any conflict issues under Coty policy. A spokeswoman for Coty said in an email: "We intend to work closely with Grey following the completion of the merger to address any potential conflict, ensure respect of appropriate business conduct principles and ensure a smooth transition." A spokesman for Grey referred calls to P&G and Coty. The media side was less complicated. Publicis Groupe's Starcom Mediavest Group retained the North American media business of the P&G brands heading to Coty following P&G's review last year, though the rest of the P&G business went to other agencies. And Publicis' ZenithOptimedia Group also won a Coty global media review last year. Last month, Publicis Groupe announced the Coty business would be consolidated with Zenith globally. Coty also has an in-house digital and content agency, Beamly, acquired last year, but there's no indication it plans to shift any creative work there from Grey. While the former P&G brands have changed hands, there are familiar faces running the business at Coty too, including longtime P&G executive Esi Eggleston Bracey, named president-Coty consumer beauty last year.

Most recently, the Pantene Beautiful Lengths Fund was created for those who want to support the program, but are unable to donate their hair. “We’re so thankful that so many people have supported the Pantene Beautiful Lengths program for 10 years, and are grateful to Walgreens for their gracious donation to help create these wigs. Women have a very special relationship with their hair—it plays a huge role in defining who they are as individuals,” says Jodi Allen, Vice President of P&G Hair Care & Color for North America Pantene. “This program has inspired so many to make selfless donations over the years, and it’s because of them, that women who have lost their hair due to cancer treatments are able to feel more like themselves every day.” Get Involved Pantene Beautiful Lengths and Walgreens encourage everyone to contribute to the Pantene Beautiful Lengths Fund. Contributions made to the Fund go directly to helping create free, real-hair wigs for women battling cancer. Visit www.gcfdn.org/pantene for more details. You can also find more information and Pantene products at your local Walgreens. Share your donation on social media and encourage your friends and family to participate by using #BeautifulLengths, tagging @Pantene and @Walgreens. About Pantene Beautiful Lengths and the Pantene Beautiful Lengths Fund Since its creation in 2006, Pantene Beautiful Lengths has provided the funds to create more than 46,000 free, real-hair wigs which are distributed through select American Cancer Society wig banks across the country. The Pantene Beautiful Lengths Fund works with the non-profit organization The Greater Cincinnati Foundation, which accepts monetary donations, allowing anyone to support the Pantene Beautiful Lengths program. Many of the women helped say that putting on a wig makes them feel like themselves again during the toughest fight of their lives and when people across the country donate to Pantene Beautiful Lengths, they are helping make that happen.

(NYSE: PG) announced that it had transferred its specialty beauty business to Coty Inc. (NYSE: COTY) in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. Assets transferred include its global fine fragrances, salon professional, cosmetics and retail hair color businesses, as well as select hair styling brands. Procter & Gamble Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer David S. Taylor said: The completion of this transaction is a key step in our journey to return P&G results to a balance of strong top-line growth, bottom-line growth and cash generation. This effectively completes the major work we undertook two years ago to streamline and strengthen our product portfolio. We are now focused on 10 product categories and about 65 brands where P&G has leading market positions and where product technologies deliver performance differences that matter most to consumers. As part of the transaction, the company retired 105.0 million shares of its stock. At the closing share price on Friday, September 30, of $89.75, that was worth some $9.4 billion. Many on Wall Street feel that the new focus on a slimmed down product portfolio will help spur earnings growth and return the company to its long-time premium consumer staples multiple. Some analyst estimates for the next two years are 2% above current Wall Street expectations, and the company posted solid earnings in the most recent quarter. In addition, 24/7 Wall St. recently noted that Procter & Gamble remains one of the Dividend Aristocrats; that is, S&P 500 companies with a history of raising their dividends for 25 years or more. The company most recently hiked its dividend in April 2016, which marked the 60th consecutive year that the consumer products giant had increased its dividend. The company actually has been paying a dividend for 126 consecutive years, since its incorporation in 1890. Also note that the number of Procter & Gamble shares short surged about 186% in early September, though that was not quite enough to lift it into the top 10 most shorted stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The 81.26 million shares short as of the most recent settlement date represented 3.1% of the total float. As mentioned, Procter & Gamble shares closed most recently at $89.75. The dividend yield is 2.9% and the market cap is nearly $240 billion. The stock has a consensus price target of about $93 and a 52-week range of $72.50 to $90.22. Investors might want to take note that this high is an all-time high.

18 novembre 2016 Aggiornato 17:30 Italia In English Biella Torino Udine Gorizia Trieste Pordenone Diario TV Diario in English Facebook Twitter RSS Business Home World Business Sports Health SciTech Life & Style Video Advertising Advertising on mobile: it's all about «stopping the thumb» Almost 80 years old, the deodorant Old Spice is learning new tricks for finding customers in the era of smartphones and social media. AFP 03 October 2016 - 14:57 print comments Ever-changing mobile landscape © (Shutterstock.com) NEW YORK - Almost 80 years old, the deodorant Old Spice is learning new tricks for finding customers in the era of smartphones and social media. The Procter & Gamble product, having spoofed itself for years with advice on how to become more "mantastic," posts to its 2.6 million Facebook followers a steady stream of video games, prize entries, and advertisements as short as two seconds. Creating "thumb-stopping" content is the goal, and marketers are doing everything they can to achieve it. That includes using neuroscience to study which visual and audio cues offer the best bet to grabbing and keeping an impatient smartphone user's attention. Estimates show that the average person looks at his or her smartphone as much as 150 times a day. The attention is there, but it's just not long-lived. "You get the three-second audition," said Frank Amorese, media director at Heineken USA. "If you are relying on the 14th or 15th second to do the heavy lifting of the ad, it's not going to work." Ever-changing mobile landscape Advertisers are in a dizzying race to connect with customers as new mobile-borne social media platforms emerge and evolve. "The landscape changes every six months," Amorese said. "It's changing at an increasingly fast rate." Digital ad spending is projected to reach $72.1 billion in 2016, growing at a rate of 21 percent and now comprising almost 37 percent of the overall market, according to eMarketer. Social media accounts for $15.4 billion of this. Heineken has doubled its spending on digital ads to 30 percent over the last five years. The dominance of smaller mobile devices has heightened the challenge of capturing the attention of potential shoppers. Ads must be tailored depending on whether they are being seen on a widescreen television, a tablet or a smartphone and must not demand too much time if a consumer is merely glancing at a feed and not planning on a lengthy stay. "We have to really identify how do consumers engage with every single platform and then what is the creative experience we need to give them," said P&G chief brand officer Marc Pritchard at the four-day Advertising Week conference in New York this week. "But it also has to look like one brand because people have 5,000 ads coming at them every day and that's 10 times what it was just 10 years ago." Measuring 'sharing velocity' Anna Fieler, chief marketing officer at PopSugar, a women's shopping and content site, said marketers are devising benchmarks like "sharing velocity" to monitor resonance. "Shareability is the gold standard of how engaged people are," she said. "People like it so much that they want to share it with someone else." Not all Ads place the brand front and center. Frito-Lay, which spends about 40 percent of its advertising budget on digital media, offers tips on its Facebook feed on professional mentoring and networking, in addition to the usual fare of ads that aim to excite and amuse. "People are using social media to build their (personal) brand," said Jeff Klein, vice president of brands and  portfolio marketing. Sometimes Frito-Lay just "takes a little bit of a back seat." 'Upload videos like crazy' Much of the buzz at the Advertising Week  conference was the wildfire growth of video streaming and broadcast of live events. Facebook vice president Will Platt-Higgins predicted video could comprise 80 percent of all smartphone content by 2020. "You've got the perfect marriage of basically a supercomputer, which is in your pocket, plus super powerful wifi, plus a video composer and a high-definition camera," he said. "All of that together creates the perfect storm for all of us to upload videos like crazy and that's what's happening." The growth of video also opens up new opportunity  for rivals like Twitter, which has lagged Facebook in terms of building profits from ads. Twitter posted 18 percent growth in advertising revenue last quarter spurred by video. It is betting that marketers will see more upside in plans for live events in pro football and other sports. Video "is the number one ad format for us now and it barely existed a year ago," said Matt Derella, vice president of global revenue and operations at Twitter. "It's risen extremely fast and it's driven by consumer behavior."

P&G workforce shrinks to smallest in 25 years Alexander Coolidge , acoolidge@enquirer.com 3:09 p.m. EDT October 3, 2016 Buy Photo Procter & Gamble is based in downtown Cincinnati. (Photo: Enquirer file/Cara Owsley)Buy Photo Procter & Gamble on Monday completed its split off from 41 beauty brands that have merged with New York's Coty Inc. Upon completion of the break, 10,000 P&G workers left the Cincinnati-based consumer product giant's payroll. They will become Coty employees in a matter of days. P&G now employs 95,000 workers worldwide. Through a combination of buyouts, layoffs, attrition and brand sales, P&G has cut 34,000 jobs or 26.4 percent of its workforce since it announced its restructuring plan in 2012. The latest move means P&G's payroll has dropped below 100,000 workers for the first time since 2003 and total enrollment is the lowest it's been since 1991. Coty separately announced Monday it had completed the merger with P&G's beauty brands. The deal makes the New York maker of Rimmel makeup and Calvin Klein perfume will become the No. 3 beauty company behind L'Oreal and Estee Lauder. The super-sized company has annual sales of $9 billion in revenues and more than 20,000 workers in 35 countries. CINCINNATI.COM P&G offer in beauty split oversubscribed Coty has acquired eight P&G factories, 10,000 new workers, assumed $1.9 billion in debt and a raft of household names. Between 35 to 40 percent of the affected workers worked at manufacturing plants. P&G brands in the deal include: CoverGirl and Max Factor makeup, Wella and Clairol hair color and licensed  fragrances Hugo Boss, Lacoste and Gucci. With the split-off complete, P&G has completed its massive brand divestiture announced two years ago aimed at paring 100 noncore labels. P&G executives promised a company will be smaller, easier-to-run and poised to resume growing sales and profits. In a statement, CEO David Taylor said the company was made up of 65 brands focused on 10 product categories. CINCINNATI.COM P&G shrinks factory footprint "The completion of this transaction is a key step in our journey to return P&G results to a balance of strong top-line growth, bottom-line growth and cash generation," Taylor said. "This effectively completes the major work we undertook two years ago to streamline and strengthen our product portfolio." Taylor also thanked the P&G employees moving over to Coty. "I want to share my personal thanks to all the employees who have transitioned to Coty,” Taylor said. “They showed amazing dedication during a period of uncertainty—demonstrating time and time again the strong character of P&G people. I thank them for everything they did during the transition and for all their years with P&G and wish them an exciting future with Coty.” With Coty's merger completed Camillo Pane became Coty's new CEO. “It is my great privilege to take over the reins of leadership at such a transformational moment," Pane said. "With this merger, we have brought together a powerful portfolio of much loved beauty brands and some of the world’s most talented people in beauty and consumer goods. I believe this combination... will enable Coty to be a challenger in the beauty industry.” ALSO IN P&G NEWS: Procter & Gamble plans to expand two factories in Hungary, creating 250 new jobs and spending $200 million. The consumer products giant has two plants and an office in and near Budapest. P&G has leased 285,000 square feet of warehouse space in Springdale. P&G will use the space at Progress Park, which is now home to operation for Avon and Macy's, to store materials used for area research and technical centers in Mason, Winton Hill, Ivorydale and Sharon Woods.

COTY, +0.38% announced today that it has completed the merger of The Procter & Gamble Company’s fine fragrance, color cosmetics, salon professional and hair color and certain styling businesses (“P&G Specialty Beauty Business”) into Coty. Coty is now the third-largest beauty company in the world, with approximately $9 billion in revenue. As a combined company, Coty will also hold the number one position in fragrances, and number two and three positions in salon hair and color cosmetics, respectively. As previously announced, following the completion of the merger, Camillo Pane became the new Chief Executive Officer of Coty. Commenting, Pane said, “It is my great privilege to take over the reins of leadership at such a transformational moment. Today marks a new chapter in Coty’s rich heritage. With this merger, we have brought together a powerful portfolio of much loved beauty brands and some of the world’s most talented people in beauty and consumer goods. I believe this combination, together with our distinctive entrepreneurial culture, focused and lean operating structure, and efficient earnings model, will enable Coty to be a challenger in the beauty industry. We aim to relentlessly pursue superior products and solutions, build brands that inspire and enable consumers to celebrate and liberate their own individual beauty.” Bart Becht, Chairman of Coty’s Board of Directors, said, “Coty is now better positioned as we aim to become, over time, a global industry leader by being a clear challenger in beauty, delighting our consumers and creating long term shareholder value. I am confident that we now have a much improved team, structure and culture to make the vision of this merger a reality. I look forward to continuing to work with the new leadership team in my role as Chairman to drive Coty to in-market success and profitable growth.” Consumer-Centric Organizational Structure, with Iconic Brands Coty is organized into three divisions: Coty Consumer Beauty, Coty Luxury and Coty Professional Beauty, each focused on their respective categories and channels, with a lean structure that enables faster decision making, focused investments and better communication with customers and consumers. Coty Consumer Beauty is focused on color cosmetics, retail hair coloring and styling products, body care and mass fragrances, with the intent of providing consumers with innovative products primarily in the mass retail channel. Its iconic brand portfolio includes Adidas, Bourjois, Clairol, COVERGIRL, David Beckham, Katy Perry, Max Factor, Rimmel, Sally Hansen and Wella. Coty Luxury is focused on expanding Coty’s leadership position in prestige fragrances and emerging position in skincare, in the Luxury Beauty market across all regions and luxury channels, including travel retail. Its fragrances include such well-known brands as Marc Jacobs, Calvin Klein, Chloé, Gucci, Hugo Boss, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, Alexander McQueen, Davidoff and Miu Miu, amongst others, and skincare brands include Lancaster and philosophy. Coty Professional Beauty is focused on servicing salon owners and professionals in both hair and nail care, covering all key salon segments and salon client needs. The professional-focused brands include Clairol Professional, Nioxin, OPI, Sebastian Professional, System Professional and Wella Professionals. Financial Benefits of Transaction Coty aims to achieve a best-in-class profit margin and cash flow conversion model in an industry with attractive growth dynamics and modest private label penetration. Coty expects to achieve total cost savings of approximately $750 [1] , million or 16% [1] of acquired revenues, through the transaction composed of: initial synergies, reflecting P&G costs that will not transfer, of approximately $350 million; and incremental cost synergies, to be recognized over four years, of approximately $400 million, achieved through a range of efficiency opportunities that the combination of the two businesses create. The merger synergies are expected to enhance Coty’s already strong margins, cash flow generation and earnings power. Including anticipated synergies, Coty expects the P&G Specialty Beauty Business merger to: Add approximately 500 to 600 basis points to Coty’s stand-alone adjusted operating profit margins over a four-year period, resulting in margins of approximately 19.6% which would make Coty a margin leader relative to its Beauty peers. Drive a pro forma increase to Coty’s fiscal year 2016 adjusted earnings per share base of approximately $0.48, including the assumed four year implementation of full run-rate synergies. Generate close to $1 billion in free cash flow by year two. Financing At the close of the transaction, Coty will assume approximately $1.9 billion of debt of the P&G Specialty Beauty Business. On a combined basis, the business at close is expected to have moderate pro forma debt leverage of approximately 3.5x net debt / Adjusted EBITDA, providing ample cash flow for the enhanced annual dividend of $0.50 per share, while preserving strategic flexibility. Outlook for Fiscal 2017 As previously communicated, Coty anticipates that the first half revenue trend will be below prior year results and the results for the combined company, as Coty continues to make strategic choices to build a better business, including rationalizing wholesale distribution, and as resources which normally work on the business have been working on closing the transaction and the future of the combined company. Coty remains committed to return the Coty business back to growth in the second six month period and is targeting to strengthen Coty’s growth rate in the following fiscal years. Coty Heritage Coty has a unique and long standing heritage of entrepreneurs, upon which the culture of the new Coty is being modeled. François Coty started his fragrance business more than 100 years ago by making perfume accessible to the general public for the first time and creating the modern fragrance category. Eugene Rimmel brought the world the first non-toxic mascara, Max Factor coined the term “make-up,” Sally Hansen pioneered nail care and Wella was the first professional hairdressing company. All of these entrepreneurs will form the inspiration for the new Coty company to bring new innovative beauty products to consumers and drive shareholder value over time. Advisors Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC served as lead financial advisor to Coty. Barclays, J.P. Morgan and BofA Merrill Lynch also acted as financial advisors, with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP serving as legal counsel, McDermott Will & Emery LLP serving as tax and U.S. antitrust counsel and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer serving as non-U.S. antitrust counsel. ---//--- Note to editors – About Camillo Pane: Camillo Pane is a global consumer goods veteran and a proven leader with a strong track record for delivering business performance.

Coty assumes no responsibility to update forward-looking statements made herein or otherwise, except as required by law. Non-GAAP Measures In this document, Coty presents adjusted operating profit margin, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe better enable management and investors to analyze and compare the underlying business results from period to period. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Coty does not provide reconciliations of such forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation, including adjustments that could be made for restructuring, integration and acquisition-related expenses, amortization expenses, adjustments to inventory, and other charges reflected in our reconciliation of historic numbers, the amount of which, based on historical experience, could be significant.

While some perfume-makers rely on celebrities, such as Kendall Jenner kicks, to move their products, the industry appears to be shifting toward artisanal scents.  (Jamie McCarthy / GETTY IMAGES)   By Stephanie WongBloomberg Tues., Oct. 4, 2016 Fabrizio Freda, the chief executive officer of Estee Lauder Cos., could tell the fragrance industry was changing by watching the members of his own family. His grandfather picked a signature cologne and never changed it, Freda says. But the executive’s son hasn’t shown that kind of loyalty — a typical attitude for younger consumers. If they wear cologne or perfume, they switch between niche brands and opt for smaller bottles. “The new generation really looks at fragrances as a wardrobe but not anymore as a personal signature,” the 59-year-old said in an interview. Many millennials don’t want mass-market perfumes, and celebrity scents — once a vibrant part of the industry — have fallen into decline. But so-called artisanal fragrances are surging. Sales of the products, which sometimes come in offbeat varieties, rose 22 per cent last year, according to the research firm NPD Group. That made them the fastest-growing fragrance segment. In short, millennials no longer want to smell like Justin Bieber or Britney Spears — they’d rather have the scent of a smoky fireplace or old lipstick. And they don’t want to wear the same perfume every day. Article Continued Below Merger deals also are reshaping the industry and intensifying competition. Revlon agreed to buy Elizabeth Arden this year, teaming up with a large maker of celebrity perfumes. And Coty is poised to become the world’s largest seller of fragrance when it completes its purchase of Procter & Gamble Co.’s 41 beauty brands this year. Premium scents have kept the industry growing despite a slump in mass-market perfumes and colognes. The $6.6 billion market for U.S. artisanal products and other premium fragrances is projected to grow 18 per cent by 2020, according to Euromonitor International. Mass-market fragrances, meanwhile, are forecast to drop 15 per cent. Celebrity brands were once seen as key growth drivers for Elizabeth Arden and Coty. But sales in that category dropped 31 per cent in 2015, according to the NPD. Coty Chairman Bart Becht said his company plans to refocus on top designer brands, such as Marc Jacobs and Gucci, while cutting out some other names. Elizabeth Arden, which gets three-quarters of its sales from scents, also could shift more toward premium names under Revlon. Estee Lauder, best known for cosmetics and face cream, has used on the artisanal trend to fuel growth. Its fragrance sales increased faster than any other segment besides makeup last year. And the scents are more profitable than some designer-label products because they don’t require the same advertising and promotion, Freda said. Estee Lauder’s Frederic Malle, Le Labo and By Kilian scents might not be known to most consumers, but they are some of its most promising fragrance brands. It also sells scents under the more recognizable names of Tom Ford and Jo Malone, offered in such varieties as nutmeg, ginger and wood sage and sea salt. “A lot of people won’t have heard of these brands, but that’s what makes them cool because it’s not the same fragrance that you smell on everybody walking down the street,” said Eleanor Dwyer, a beauty analyst at Euromonitor. “It’s a discovery that you made. You liked it, and you bought it — and you’re wearing it.” For the past five years, the top brands in the U.S. have been dominated by European companies, Chanel SA and L’Oreal SA, according to Euromonitor data. But New York-based Estee Lauder has climbed the charts with its Jo Malone scents. The label jumped to the No. 9 spot last year, up from No. 24 five years ago. Angela Lopez, who works in finance in New York and wore Chanel No. 5 in her college years, is an example of a millennial shopper looking for something different. “I used to wear what’s popular, but I don’t want to smell like everyone else now,” said the 31-year-old. “There are some perfumes that you smell everywhere. I like to discover new names and buy from small boutiques. It’s more expensive, but it’s worth it.” That attitude has prompted the industry to adopt smaller sizes, such as rollerballs that come in at around 10 millilitres. That’s the fastest-growing form of packaging, with an increase of 50 per cent or more last year, according to Euromonitor data. Most other sizes either dropped or grew less than 1 per cent. Rollerball-size fragrances can cost less than half the normal price, making it easier for budget-conscious millennials to try out new scents, said Karen Grant, a beauty analyst at the NPD. That could then build a foundation for the future. “A younger consumer is able to discover, experiment, carry it with them,” Grant said. “Different formats provide access to even higher-end fragrances, so then they are ready to graduate into a full fragrance.” The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

Published on October 04, 2016. Reprints Reprints Carolyn Everson. Credit: Nathan Skid for Advertising Age Most Popular Carolyn Everson is drawing on the wall at Facebook's offices in New York. It's a warning sign of sorts. There's a graph of revenue over time, and there are four basic kinds of companies represented: the comfortable giants with plenty of money but plateauing growth, rivals that have more or less caught the giants and are still growing, the startups that might come for them all, and the flameouts. "This is something that I've been using to guide a lot of my conversations with key clients over the last nine months," Ms. Everson said. "So a lot of what we do, culture is the most important." Why is Facebook's VP-global marketing solutions so focused on what she calls "culture" questions? Here's what Ms. Everson had to say about how she's schooling the industry to not just innovate but, of course, use Facebook to do so. This conversation has been lightly edited. Advertising Age: What do you tell advertisers about "culture" and why it's important? Carolyn Everson: Think of it this way. There are the traditional companies -- General Motors, Ford, Marriott, Starwood, Procter and Gamble, Unilever, Coke, Pepsi -- the traditional companies that have been around a long time, and they're either growing in single digits or they're declining or flattening, but none of them are skyrocketing, for the most part.

They're emerging on the scene. They're often mobile-first. They get a lot of excitement. They get the funding, but they execute really poorly and they implode, because if you think about it every day, about 1,000 apps get sent to iOS and Android for approval. They all don't make it. There are these companies that are superhot and, poof, they're gone. Then there are you know, take Walmart, Target, and take Amazon. Amazon is clearly coming at them. And sometimes these types of companies are too small for the bigger companies to even see a hit on their revenue, but you know they're coming. Ad Age: How can Facebook even begin to help with a client's culture? Ms. Everson: With 4 million advertisers we get to see all the different kinds of companies, because we have relationships with all the top marketers. And the disruptors often are building their businesses -- they might spend 90% of their investment on Facebook. That's not an uncommon thing we see. Ad Age: So, you've helped diagnose cultural shifts for clients. How does that help Facebook? Ms. Everson: Here's the thing. If you can start to act more like a disruptor -- move fast, get rid of the silos, become more collaborative, more data-driven -- what we do becomes more intuitive. They start saying, "Of course, we need to create hundreds of versions of creative and test them." And, of course, we can't be on a six- to nine-month creative cycle, because that's just not the way these digital environments work. And, of course, we're going to measure business outcomes and not proxy metrics. Ad Age: What do you tell any lumbering companies to do? Ms. Everson: There are four strategies. You can't just sit there and say I'm not going to do anything. One is acquisition -- what Unilever did with Dollar Shave Club. And Walmart bought Jet. Just in the last two months that happened. The second strategy that we see is to create an investment arm of your company and invest like you're a VC. That's what General Motors did with Lyft. They gave them $500 million, and I'm sure they'd love Lyft to be successful, but on the other side I'm sure GM is doing it to learn. The third one is to create what I've called parallel organizations by setting up a separate team in the company that operates with different KPIs. The fourth is rewiring of the culture, and that's the hardest one to do. It is hard to find companies that have rewired themselves culturally. IBM is one. They've done a really good job of rewiring their culture. Kodak is one example -- they blew all four strategies. Ad Age: How does all this culture talk fit into all the changes in advertising? For instance, do you see brands continuing to change their agencies, which we've seen a lot of? Ms. Everson: I do hear there will be more, but I don't know. My hope for the industry is that they're being done in the right spirit, in the spirit of maybe changing the model of how they are working. Perhaps they want media and creative to work more closely together, which I personally think is going to be a major theme we're going to see in the agency community. If you look at AT&T's decision around Omnicom and Hearts & Science and BBDO, it's a blending of media and creative. Media and creative I just think have to come closer together. Even if a brand gives its media to one holding company and creative to another, they will need them both to be working together more closely.

By James Gray / Published 4th October 2016 GETTY NEW BOY: Bradley is the first American manager in Premier League history March 3, 1958: Robert Bradley was born in Montclair, New Jersey, the oldest of three sons to his parents Jerry and Mary. His father had turned down a minor league baseball contract with the Chicago Cubs to join the Marines. On his return from Korea he went to Upsala College and played baseball and American football but never went professional, and never had any interest in ‘soccer’. 1970: Bradley went to West Essex High School which was rare in that it was a school that took football seriously when others were playing the American version. The best Premier League summer signings XI Tuesday, 4th October 2016 THE 2016/17 Premier League season is well and truly underway - and it seems as though some clubs have performed some fantastic business over the summer. 1 / 12 GETTY GK: Steve Mandanda - Brought in on a free and has already begun to shown his quality for Palace. A huge upgrade on Hennessey 1976: Bradley played on the right wing for four years and graduated as one of the highest rated players in the state. He was accepted into Princeton but didn’t want to go because they did not offer an athletic scholarship. But his parents told him they would make the money work. 1978: In his second year at university, his footballing days looked like they might be ended by a bad leg break. But he rehabilitated himself and returned to the game the following summer and scored four times on his return. 1981: Having briefly worked for Proctor & Gamble, Bradley joined the Ohio University management programme and got his first job in management aged just 22. 1984: Bradley worked his way to the job in charge of the Princeton Tigers just four years after he had left the team as a player. In his 11 years there he won two Ivy League titles and reached the national semi-finals. 1987: Bob's son is born, Michael. He would go on to win more than 100 caps for the US and played for Aston Villa and Roma. He now plays in MLS for Toronto FC. 1996: After working at the Olympics as an assistant on the US under-23s, Bradley was taken on by Bryce Arena at DC United in the first year of Major League Soccer. 1998: Bradley got his first managerial post on a professional team when he was hired by the Chicago Fire and won the MLS Cup and US Open Cup in his first year. He won MLS Coach of the Year for his achievements. 2002: Bradley returned to his home state to manage the MetroStars, and turned their fortunes around significantly. 2003: MetroStars reached the final of the US Open Cup and the play-offs. 2005: Bradley was unable to maintain his early form though and is fired three games before the end of the season. 2006: Bradley was appointed to US soccer’s top job, in charge of the national team, and won the Gold Cup within a year of taking over. 2010: Bradley led the US to the top of Group C at the 2010 World Cup, beating Algeria and drawing with Slovenia before losing to Ghana in the last 16. 2011: After defeat in the Gold Cup final to Mexico, Bradley was sacked. He was out of work for just two months before taking over the Egyptian national team. 2013: After Egypt were beaten 7-3 on aggregate by Ghana in the last round of qualifying for the 2014 World Cup, Bradley was dismissed. 2014: Bradley became the first ever American to manage in a European top division when he was given the Stabaek job in Norway. 2015: Having led Stabaek to a third place in the Norwegian league, Bradley was poached by Le Havre in Ligue 2. He took over with the side struggling in 15th position but finished the season in 4th. 2016: With Le Havre 5th in Ligue 2, Bradley was brought in at Swansea to replace Francesco Guidolin with the Swans 17th in the Premier League after seven games.

An Institute for Supply Management report showed its index of national factory activity rose to 51.5 in September, up from 49.4 in August. A reading above 50 signals expansion. The September reading exceeded expectations from economists in separate Bloomberg and Reuters polls. Wall Street fell. In 2.06pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index also declined 0.3 percent. In 1.54pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.5 percent. The Dow moved lower as declines in shares of Travelers and those of Procter & Gamble, last down 1.5 percent and 1.4 percent respectively, outweighed gains in shares of DuPont and those of United Technologies, recently up 2 percent and 0.6 percent respectively. US Treasuries dropped, pushing yields on the 10-year note two basis points higher to 1.62 percent. Investors are focused on this week’s US jobs data, especially Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report. “Markets are warming up to the idea that the Fed is going to hike rates,” John Canally, chief economic strategist at LPL Financial in Boston, told Bloomberg. Meanwhile, shares of Cabela's jumped, trading 14.7 percent higher at US$63.00 as of 2.04pm in New York, after the company said it agreed to be acquired by Bass Pro Shops in a deal valued at about US$5.5 billion. Bass Pro Shops will pay US$65.50 a share in cash, Cabela’s said. The US-listed shares of Deutsche Bank slid 2.1 percent in afternoon trade as the German lender seeks to negotiate a settlement over the sale of residential mortgage securities with the Department of Justice. A number of Deutsche Bank executives are due to be in the US this week in part for the International Monetary Fund’s annual meeting in Washington. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with an advance of 0.1 percent. France’s CAC 40 Index edged 0.1 percent higher, and the UK’s FTSE 100 Index climbed 1.2 percent. German markets were closed for a holiday. While UK stocks rose, the pound slid after Prime Minister Theresa May said she'll start the two-year process to take the UK out of the European Union, or Brexit, by the end of March. “Europe feels a little cautious,” said Chris Beauchamp, a market analyst at IG in London, told Bloomberg. “The market is taking cues from any newsflow around banks, and the problem was that there wasn’t really anything concrete over the weekend. That means panic could still spike again and German stocks are ripe for some weakness [on Tuesday]. The FTSE 100 is in its own world with the lower pound, which might provide a useful dynamic going into the last quarter.” (BusinessDesk) © Scoop Media BusinessDesk Independent, Trustworthy New Zealand Business News The Wellington-based BusinessDesk team led by former Bloomberg Asian top editor Jonathan Underhill and Qantas Award-winning journalist and commentator Pattrick Smellie provides a daily news feed for a serious business audience.

A number of Deutsche Bank executives are due to be in the US this week in part for the International Monetary Fund’s annual meeting in Washington. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with an advance of 0.1 percent. France’s CAC 40 Index edged 0.1 percent higher, and the UK’s FTSE 100 Index climbed 1.2 percent. German markets were closed for a holiday. While UK stocks rose, the pound slid after Prime Minister Theresa May said she’ll start the two-year process to take the UK out of the European Union, or Brexit, by the end of March. “Europe feels a little cautious,” said Chris Beauchamp, a market analyst at IG in London, told Bloomberg. “The market is taking cues from any newsflow around banks, and the problem was that there wasn’t really anything concrete over the weekend. That means panic could still spike again and German stocks are ripe for some weakness [on Tuesday]. The FTSE 100 is in its own world with the lower pound, which might provide a useful dynamic going into the last quarter.” (BusinessDesk) Content Sourced from scoop.co.nz Original url  Print This Post Tweet     Blogroll China Economic Scan Compare house prices Deposit Rates Direct Broking – NZX & ASX Trading & Prices Findata – Market Data Good Returns Herald Business Interest.co.nz – Interest Rates News & Views National Business Review Property Talk Sharechat Stuff Business Value Cruncher – NZX Latest Business news Sentence sends message to keep housing market honest South Island highways update – 7:00pm Friday 18 November Kaikoura Emergency Access Road remains closed MTF lifts full-year sales, underlying profit falls MARKET CLOSE: NZ shares rise, led by Auckland Airport Ports of Auckland does deal with KiwiRail NZ dollar dips below 70 US cents, as market adjusts to Trump Tenon shareholders approve sale of US business Four Square Raglan to the rescue with much needed water Kaibosh evacuated but trucking on Kaikoura earthquake – Expert reaction 8 Once ‘Bad’ Russia is Now ‘Good’ as PM Flip Flops Again Earthquake and tsunami, genes, and spin off to science MPI boosts surveillance around Kaikoura coast Kiwis rally in support of Vodafone boost Text Links Recent Comments Lan: Unbelievable that a WEST AUSTR... jackp: Murray, when Key is involved t...

The S&P 500 healthcare index fell 0.7 percent, the most among the 10 major S&P indexes that were lower, due to declines in Pfizer and Merck. Consumer staples fell 0.59 percent, dragged down by Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo. The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) from the Institute of Supply Management is expected to show that factory activity expanded in September after having contracted in August. Investors are also on the lookout for news from Deutsche Bank, which is working to reach a settlement with U.S. authorities who have demanded a fine of up to $14 billion from the bank for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities. While the bank's Frankfurt-listed stock was not trading due to a public holiday, its U.S.-listed shares were down 1.2 percent at $12.96 on Monday. The travails of Germany's biggest lender has unsettled investors who are now awaiting third-quarter corporate earnings and the upcoming U.S. presidential election. "It looks like a quiet start to the day and that's not surprising," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Equity Capital Markets in New York. "It's a back-end loaded week with jobs numbers on Friday, but if we get a positive read on ISM manufacturing, we could say that August was a blip and that will be constructive for the markets today." A report on monthly hiring activity on Friday will be assessed by investors as it will play a big role in the Federal Reserve's decision on raising interest rates this year. At 9:37 a.m. ET (1337 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 79.3 points, or 0.43 percent, at 18,228.85. The S&P 500 was down 7.33 points, or 0.34 percent, at 2,160.94 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 8.31 points, or 0.16 percent, at 5,303.69. Tesla shares rose 2.3 percent to $208.82 after the electric carmaker said third-quarter deliveries rose by 70 percent to 24,500 cars. Janus Capital soared 17 percent after the asset manager said it had agreed to an all-share $6 billion merger with London-listed rival Henderson Global. Cabela's surged 14.5 percent to $62.90 after the company said it would be acquired by Bass Pro Shops in a deal valued at about $5.5 billion. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,585 to 1,038. On the Nasdaq, 1,343 issues fell and 936 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed two new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 23 new highs and seven new lows.

Awards AToMiC Awards Shopper Innovation Awards Strategy   Home Calendar Awards Magazine Screening Room Careers Categories Branding Media Retail Youth Research Innovation Industry Moves Shopper Marketing Home » Agencies, Branding » Why agencies compete on price Former Cadbury marketer and current CASSIES editor John Bradley on how to solve the price war problem. By Strategy Staff October 2, 2016 One thing I hear frequently from senior agency leaders these days is how clients are constantly demanding more service for lower fees (usually in a tone that implies said clients are nothing more than ungrateful, mentally challenged, penny pinching wretches). Perhaps not unnaturally, given my client background, I take a different view. I think such behaviour is inevitable given that the market for ad agencies bears all the hallmarks of one that competes almost entirely on price. Price competition is not an aberration in markets; it’s the default competition mechanism unless strategies are employed to avoid it. We clients have wrestled with this beast for more than a century. One route is to have a commonly agreed upon pricing mechanism. This is what kept ad agency fees out of price competition for most of the 20th century, with compensation at a fixed percentage of media spend, and it’s a mechanism that keeps realtors in BMWs to this day. But there is a vulnerability: players losing market share can also lose their nerve. When that dam burst during the 1990s, price competition took hold. Procter & Gamble’s and Lever Bros.’ response to having more than 400 price-cutting competing firms to deal with in the early 20th century U.S. soap market was to buy most of them up. This approach is somewhat reminiscent of that employed more recently by WPP, Omnicom, Publicis and Interpublic. However, it did – and still does – create a new problem: what to do with the vast brand portfolios that result? The agency world has largely taken the route that Lever took: benign internal competition. But that never really solves the price war problem, which can remain rampant between the larger groupings. The only truly effective, enduring and legal solution to competing on price came from the P&G market statistics department, where it became apparent to then-president Neil McElroy that the Camay brand was losing sales – not to Lever Bros., but to P&G’s own Ivory soap. His solution – brand management – led quickly to the price war-avoiding Holy Grail of segmentation. By targeting Camay at one cleansing need and Ivory at another, both could happily occupy different price points. Prior to this, all soaps had targeted every cleansing need, leaving price as the decider – a bit like all agencies targeting every client. At first glance, it seems this segmentation can’t work in the agency world. Position yourself as the agency specializing in auto accounts and, thanks to client conflict concerns, you will only ever have one account. However, you can regain pricing control by deciding the part of the customer proposition you will be the best at, protecting you from price competition with the customers who most value that attribute. Thus, L’Oréal and Estée Lauder compete by specializing in different components of the cosmetics offer: L’Oréal is unbeatable on science, while Estée Lauder is unbeatable on service. Can this work in the agency world? Yes, it can, but it’s currently found mostly within small, young agencies. Such agencies, due to the background and expertise of the founder(s), tend to have a unique approach to, and be uncommonly good at, a certain part of the job, be it planning, brand turnarounds, digital or whatever. If you as a client desperately seek that attribute, then, within reason, you will pay their price. Maintaining that expertise as the agency grows is the banana skin. Agencies don’t grow organically, they grow in big leaps: win a big account and you have to recruit 50 people pronto. Making the areas of uniqueness part of the DNA of the agency is next to impossible when talent is almost always imported en masse. Should that pitfall be avoided, the founders cashing out invariably signals the beginning of the end. A necessary component of any successful segmentation strategy is having the nerve to not try to be good at everything; it didn’t work for Ivory soap and it doesn’t work now. Unless you can identify areas you are not going to focus on, and demonstrate why you are the best at what you will focus on, you don’t have a strategy and will keep dropping your shorts on price. John Bradley is a former VP, marketing for Cadbury. He’s now an author and judging coordinator for the CASSIES.

Consumer staples fell 0.59 percent, dragged down by Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo. The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) from the Institute of Supply Management is expected to show that factory activity expanded in September after having contracted in August. Investors are also on the lookout for news from Deutsche Bank, which is working to reach a settlement with U.S. authorities who have demanded a fine of up to $14 billion from the bank for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities. While the bank's Frankfurt-listed stock was not trading due to a public holiday, its U.S.-listed shares were down 1.2 percent at $12.96 on Monday. The travails of Germany's biggest lender has unsettled investors who are now awaiting third-quarter corporate earnings and the upcoming U.S. presidential election. "It looks like a quiet start to the day and that's not surprising," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Equity Capital Markets in New York. "It's a back-end loaded week with jobs numbers on Friday, but if we get a positive read on ISM manufacturing, we could say that August was a blip and that will be constructive for the markets today." A report on monthly hiring activity on Friday will be assessed by investors as it will play a big role in the Federal Reserve's decision on raising interest rates this year. At 9:37 a.m. ET (1337 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 79.3 points, or 0.43 percent, at 18,228.85. The S&P 500 was down 7.33 points, or 0.34 percent, at 2,160.94 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 8.31 points, or 0.16 percent, at 5,303.69. Tesla shares rose 2.3 percent to $208.82 after the electric carmaker said third-quarter deliveries rose by 70 percent to 24,500 cars. Janus Capital soared 17 percent after the asset manager said it had agreed to an all-share $6 billion merger with London-listed rival Henderson Global. Cabela's surged 14.5 percent to $62.90 after the company said it would be acquired by Bass Pro Shops in a deal valued at about $5.5 billion. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,585 to 1,038. On the Nasdaq, 1,343 issues fell and 936 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed two new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 23 new highs and seven new lows.

October 3 2016 at 11:29am By Saritha Rai AFP Jeff Bezos. File picture: Win McNamee Bengaluru - When Jeff Bezos donned a bandhgala jacket two years ago and posed for photographs in India, he wasn't just promoting Amazon.com’s year-old business in the country. The web retailer's chief executive officer was also putting his reputation on the line to break into the emerging e-commerce market. Now, with 80 million products for sale, 120 000-plus merchants and more than two dozen warehouses, Bezos's protégé Amit Agarwal is aiming to make Amazon the country's top online store by sales ahead of the Diwali shopping season. Known as the “festival of lights”, the run-up to the celebration is India's biggest retail event, when consumers buy everything from clothes and electronics to jewellery and cars. Indians will spend as much as $1.7 billion online during Diwali this year, according to RedSeer Consulting. Flipkart, India's top web retailer, and local rival Snapdeal, are well aware that they're facing a critical test this year amid Amazon's onslaught. All three are flooding newspapers, billboards and TV shows with ads and are offering discounts for Diwali, which now makes up a third of annual e-commerce sales. At stake is the future of India's online shopping market, as well as Amazon's global expansion plans, which had faltered after it failed to conquer China. “This season could decide who'll be the ultimate winner,” said Haresh Chawla, a Mumbai-based partner at private equity firm India Value Fund Advisors and an angel investor. “The loser will get unnerved and the victor can build internal confidence and rally the troops for the bigger game.” Reaching consumers in India has never been easy - just ask Unilever NV or Procter & Gamble, which spent decades making inroads into the market. There are 22 official languages, and consumption habits differ from place to place. On top of that, there are supply chain inefficiencies, high real estate costs, lack of skilled workers, along with poor infrastructure and labyrinthine regulations. Even so, the prospect of becoming the main web store in a country of 1.25 billion people who are just learning how to shop online is tantalising. RedSeer Consultancy estimates that annual online sales will be $80 billion to $100 billion by 2020 from the current estimate of about $13 billion. “Barely 2 percent of the population shops online,” said Mrigank Gutgutia, who covers consumer internet trends at the Bangalore-based researcher. “It is still only the tip of the India e-commerce iceberg.” Merrill Lynch estimates that Amazon may sell as much as $81 billion in merchandise by 2025, up from $3.7 billion last year. Becoming India's top web retailer would be a vindication for Amazon. In China, the only other market with more than a billion people, the company has little to show after a dozen years, thanks to the dominance of Alibaba Group Holding and other local web retailers. “The biggest opportunity and the biggest challenges are both in India,” said Agarwal, chief of Amazon India. “It's going to be a great Diwali.” After graduating from Stanford University, the 42-year-old spent part of his career at Amazon's Seattle headquarters as Bezos's technical shadow, a coveted position at the company that grooms future leaders by giving them a front-row view of how the business is run. To expand inventory, Amazon has been recruiting sellers at breakneck speed. The web retailer has deployed an army of white-and-orange Chai Carts with emissaries who teach sellers how to list inventory and handle returns over cups of milky chai tea. Another service, called Feet-on-Street, sends people on motorbikes to help merchants photograph and market their wares. Another big task will be moving beyond India's eight big urban areas and into smaller towns and cities. “There could be a protest on the streets, potholes on the road, labor challenges, warehouses in different regions with varied rules, goods trucks passing through state checkpoints - and after all this, the package still has to arrive at the customers’ doorstep overnight if not within hours,” Agarwal said. One key goal for Amazon - its tagline for Diwali is tyohar bade dilwala (the festival with a big heart) - is to lure dormant shoppers and first-time buyers. There are important trends working in Amazon's favour. Exploding smartphone use offers the promise of bringing online commerce to hundreds of millions of buyers and sellers. All of these efforts in India cost money; in June, Amazon said it will invest an additional $3 billion in India on top of an already allocated $2 billion. “An open funding tap could help Amazon offer discounts and bleed out some of its rivals,” said RedSeer's Gutgutia. For Flipkart and Snapdeal, the upcoming Diwali season will determine their ability to stay in the game. For smaller e-commerce startups, survival is at stake. Many, like AskmeBazaar - which advertised aggressively during Diwali last year - shut down before they could make it to this one. Flipkart, the current market leader with more than 100 million registered users, is getting ready. Amazon's top rival in India is in advanced discussions with Wal-Mart Stores to sell a minority stake to the US retailer for as much as $1 billion. The Indian web retailer is adding 10 000 temp workers to handle last-mile logistics, and is offering financing plans to put expensive purchases within customers' reach. Flipkart's tagline this year is ab itne me itnaaa milega: now you'll get so much for so little. Delhi-based Snapdeal, whose backers include Alibaba and Softbank Group, re-branded itself ahead of the shopping season, with a red box logo (its pitch: unbox zindagi, or unbox life). Consumers like Nivedita Raju, are already noticing the difference. The Bangalore-based government official, who buys DVDs, herbs and knickknacks online, said that when she was looking for a computer title that was out-of-stock on Amazon, the web retailer had it printed and dispatched within 10 days. “It’s a very different level of customer service than Indians have been used to,” she said.

News VA chief sees Congress letting politics slow veteran reforms Tom PhilpottContact ReporterMilitary Update Privacy Policy "I was confirmed 97-to-0," says VA Secretary Bob McDonald, recalling the Senate vote in July 2014 on his nomination to lead 360,000 VA employees and an aging infrastructure in delivering health care, disability and education benefits, and a host of other services, to millions of veterans. "And what I sensed was an appetite for, an urging for, somebody with experience transforming large organizations to do that," adds the retired chief executive officer and board chairman of Proctor & Gamble Co. "While I have seen that, I have seen it sporadically. And right now, perhaps because of the elections upcoming, we're seeing a hiatus in that kind of thinking." In an hour-long interview in his office overlooking the White House, McDonald expands on the surprisingly sharp critique of Congress he delivered a week earlier while testifying on recommendations of the congressionally chartered Commission on Care. McDonald is upset to see fiscal 2016 expiring with Congress having failed to pass up to two dozen pieces of legislation he labels "essential" for continuing to transform VA to better serve veterans — with faster access to quality health care outside VA, breaking a disgraceful logjam of disability claim appeals, shelving archaic statutes that handcuff staff, and more. The enthusiasm he felt on Capitol Hill two years ago came amid a patient wait-time scandal that alarmed veterans and demoralized the Veterans Health Administration. It also spurred Congress, nearing a long election-year recess, to swiftly negotiate and pass a flawed Veterans Choice Act, hailed with false promises that would confuse and anger veterans. McDonald, a top industry executive but also a West Point graduate and former Army Ranger, not only was volunteering to clean up a mess but to transform the entire department, its legacy practices and systems, into a high-performance organization that would put customers — veterans — first. The transformation is well underway, McDonald says, but it won't progress at the speed and breadth veterans deserve unless Congress helps. VA needs legislation to streamline and consolidate six separate community-based care programs that VA still must run in addition to the Choice program. It needs authority to repair a broken claims appeal system that has veterans waiting three years for a decision; to lift unnecessary limits on physician work hours; to extend VA authorities to maintain services, such as transportation to facilities in rural areas and for vocational rehabilitation, and to fix provider agreements with long-term care facilities so the hassle of dealing with VA don't keep enticing these facilities to turn out vets. These are highlights of a 100 proposals sent to Congress with the VA budget in February, most of which haven't been voted on by both the House and Senate to become law, McDonald says, despite the continuous pro-veteran rhetoric heard from Republicans holding majorities in both chambers. McDonald notes that in May the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee with bipartisan support cleared an omnibus bill, the Veterans First Act, packed with reforms. Yet no floor vote has been scheduled. A senator or two, it seems, has a hold on the bill, upset over how it would be funded or over how it would keep VA in control of access to non-VA health providers. Despite that disappointment, McDonald suggests he's worked well with the Senate committee and chairman Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.). The House, meanwhile, has passed many separate veteran bills that VA doesn't view as critical. Recently it voted for the appeals process reforms VA wants, but linked it to tougher accountability measure that the administration opposes. The disputed provisions would relax employee job protections so that, at VA alone, staff could be fired or demoted more easily for wrongdoing or poor performance than is possible in other agencies. Many bills get passed "as demonstrations of a particular ideology [without] bipartisan support," says McDonald. "As a result, it's all about legislative jujitsu of can you get the president to agree to something he doesn't want to agree to, by attaching something good to it." McDonald says he realized soon after becoming secretary that veterans' issues, even priority reforms strongly backed by veteran service organizations, are not free these days of the bitter partisanship that has made Congresses increasingly dysfunctional. "I perceived that relatively early on," he says, "particularly when there was this spirit of 'gotcha!' If you say the wrong word, the political opposition tries to exploit it in order to embarrass the administration. It wasn't something I was familiar with in business." His harshest critics are Republicans on the House Veterans Affairs Committee. Its chairman, Rep. Jeff Miller (Fla.), led lengthy investigations into the patient wait-time scandal and launched many other examinations of VA waste, fraud and abuse since taking the committee gavel in 2011. His staff pumps out a steady stream of press releases focusing on VA corruption. Miller says McDonald failed in his promise to establish "a climate of accountability" across VA workforce despite his claims of 3,750 staff firings. McDonald doesn't mention Miller by name for this column, but he's the presumed target of some pointed remarks. "You've got to make a decision in life," the secretary says. "Are you always going to be pointing out problems, which is easy to do, or are you going to be part of the solution? It's a cop-out to be what I call an 'against' leader. You know, 'I can negotiate a better deal' or 'you've improved access [to health care] but not enough.' It's always easy to criticize what someone else has done. But that's not going to improve things for veterans." I asked if, in his opinion, some Republicans don't want this administration to be able to claim more victories on behalf of veterans. McDonald replies, "Maybe that's the issue. Maybe that's the issue." He says he hasn't made that charge to committee leaders. "But one thing I did say is we've got to stop using veterans as political pawns. Veterans are getting very upset about standing behind candidates, being thanked for their service, but then not getting part of the sacred covenant Abraham Lincoln talked about in his Second Inaugural address." If the priority is party politics, McDonald finds irony in the quest, because he was a Republican when nominated, a donor even to prominent GOP candidates from his home state of Ohio, including John Boehner. "Now I say my political party is the Veterans' Party," McDonald says. Send comments to Military Update, P.O.

Becoming India's top web retailer would be a vindication for Amazon. RELATED COMPANIES EXPAND ADD TO Portfolio Watchlist OUTLOOK? +ve -ve Procter & Gamble x Loading data... ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ By Saritha Rai When Jeff Bezos donned a bandhgala jacket two years ago and posed for photographs in India, he wasn't just promoting Amazon's year-old business in the country. The web retailer's chief executive officer was also putting his reputation on the line to break into the emerging e-commerce market. Now, with 80 million products for sale, 120,000-plus merchants and more than two dozen warehouses, Bezos's protégé Amit Agarwal is aiming to make Amazon the country's top online store by sales ahead of the Diwali shopping season. Known as the "festival of lights," the run-up to the celebration is India's biggest retail event, when consumers buy everything from clothes and electronics to jewelry and cars. Indians will spend as much as $1.7 billion online during Diwali this year, according to RedSeer Consulting. Flipkart, India's top web retailer, and local rival Snapdeal, are well aware that they're facing a critical test this year amid Amazon's onslaught. All three are flooding newspapers, billboards and TV shows with ads and are offering discounts for Diwali, which now makes up a third of annual e-commerce sales. At stake is the future of India's online shopping market, as well as Amazon's global expansion plans, which had faltered after it failed to conquer China. "This season could decide who'll be the ultimate winner," said Haresh Chawla, a Mumbai-based partner at private equity firm India Value Fund Advisors and an angel investor. "The loser will get unnerved and the victor can build internal confidence and rally the troops for the bigger game." Reaching consumers in India has never been easy-just ask Unilever NV or Procter & Gamble, which spent decades making inroads into the market. There are 22 official languages, and consumption habits differ from place to place. On top of that, there are supply chain inefficiencies, high real estate costs, lack of skilled workers, along with poor infrastructure and labyrinthine regulations. Even so, the prospect of becoming the main web store in a country of 1.25 billion people who are just learning how to shop online is tantalizing. RedSeer Consultancy estimates that annual online sales will be $80 billion to $100 billion by 2020 from the current estimate of about $13 billion."Barely 2 percent of the population shops online," said Mrigank Gutgutia, who covers consumer internet trends at the Bangalore-based researcher. "It is still only the tip of the India e-commerce iceberg." Merrill Lynch estimates that Amazon may sell as much as $81 billion in merchandise by 2025, up from $3.7 billion last year. Becoming India's top web retailer would be a vindication for Amazon. In China, the only other market with more than a billion people, the company has little to show after a dozen years, thanks to the dominance of Alibaba and other local web retailers. "The biggest opportunity and the biggest challenges are both in India," said Agarwal, chief of Amazon India. "It's going to be a great Diwali." After graduating from Stanford University, the 42-year-old spent part of his career at Amazon's Seattle headquarters as Bezos's technical shadow, a coveted position at the company that grooms future leaders by giving them a front-row view of how the business is run. To expand inventory, Amazon has been recruiting sellers at breakneck speed. The web retailer has deployed an army of white-and-orange Chai Carts with emissaries who teach sellers how to list inventory and handle returns over cups of milky chai tea. Another service, called Feet-on-Street, sends people on motorbikes to help merchants photograph and market their wares. Another big task will be moving beyond India's eight big urban areas and into smaller towns and cities. "There could be a protest on the streets, potholes on the road, labor challenges, warehouses in different regions with varied rules, goods trucks passing through state checkpoints-and after all this, the package still has to arrive at the customers' doorstep overnight if not within hours," Agarwal said. One key goal for Amazon-its tagline for Diwali is tyohar bade dilwala (the festival with a big heart)-is to lure dormant shoppers and first-time buyers. There are important trends working in Amazon's favor. Exploding smartphone use offers the promise of bringing online commerce to hundreds of millions of buyers and sellers. All of these efforts in India cost money; in June, Amazon said it will invest an additional $3 billion in India on top of an already allocated $2 billion. "An open funding tap could help Amazon offer discounts and bleed out some of its rivals," said RedSeer's Gutgutia. For Flipkart and Snapdeal, the upcoming Diwali season will determine their ability to stay in the game. For smaller e-commerce startups, survival is at stake. Many, like AskmeBazaar-which advertised aggressively during Diwali last year-shut down before they could make it to this one. Flipkart, the current market leader with more than 100 million registered users, is getting ready. Amazon's top rival in India is in advanced discussions with Wal-Mart Stores to sell a minority stake to the US retailer for as much as $1 billion. The Indian web retailer is adding 10,000 temp workers to handle last-mile logistics, and is offering financing plans to put expensive purchases within customers' reach. Flipkart's tagline this year is ab itne me itnaaa milega: now you'll get so much for so little. Delhi-based Snapdeal, whose backers include Alibaba and Softbank , re-branded itself ahead of the shopping season, with a red box logo (its pitch: unbox zindagi, or unbox life). Consumers like Nivedita Raju, are already noticing the difference. The Bangalore-based government official, who buys DVDs, herbs and knickknacks online, said that when she was looking for a computer title that was out-of-stock on Amazon, the web retailer had it printed and dispatched within 10 days. "It's a very different level of customer service than Indians have been used to," she said. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

Oct. 4, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Federal District Court Judge Vince Chhabria has canceled the October 6th hearing in San Francisco that had been scheduled in the federal injunction case the American Small Business League (ASBL) had filed against the Small Business Administration (SBA). No specific reason was given for the cancelation of the hearing. The case will now be decided based on the briefs that have been filed by both parties. The ASBL was pursuing a federal injunction to stop the SBA from diverting billions of dollars a year in federal small business contracts to Fortune 500 firms and thousands of other large businesses. In 2003, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) uncovered the SBA had included billions of dollars in federal contracts to over 5,300 large businesses to falsify the governments compliance with the 23% small business contracting goal. Every year since 2005, the SBA Office of Inspector General has named the diversion of federal small business contracts to large businesses as the number one problem at the SBA. In 2008, President Obama released the statement, "It is time to end the diversion of federal small business contracts to corporate giants." Continue Reading American Small Business League Logo In 2015, the SBA reported contracts to 151 Fortune 500 firms and their subsidiaries as small business contracts. Firms the SBA reported as small business included, Apple, General Electric, IBM, UPS, Hewlett-Packard, Home Depot, Verizon, Bank of America, Target, Wells Fargo, Pepsi, CVS, Oracle, Raytheon, Microsoft and Procter & Gamble.  The ASBL was also asking the court to grant an injunction to stop the SBA's longstanding policy of excluding the majority of the total federal acquisition budget to falsify compliance with the 23% small business contracting goal. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the total federal acquisition budget in 2015 was $1.2 trillion, which would mean small businesses should have received a minimum of $276 billion. The SBA used a number of less than $370 billion to claim small business received 24.9% of all federal contracts in 2015. The ASBL estimates that as opposed to the $276 billion legitimate small businesses should have received in 2015, they likely received between $35 to $40 billion or just 3% of all federal contracts.    ASBL attorney Robert Belshaw stated, "I'm disappointed that we won't get a chance to present an oral argument in front of the court. The issues in the case are of critical importance to the nation's 28 million small businesses. It would be unfortunate if the case was dismissed based on a procedural technicality from the SBA. The merits of our case are very strong and we are looking forward to a favorable ruling based on the strength of our briefs." The ASBL and their supporters will be holding a protest in front of the Federal Building starting at 9:00a.m. Thursday, October 6th. Judge Chhabria's ruling in the case is expected within the next two weeks.

A contributor of Forbes, Kimberly A. Whitler, PhD, University of Virginia Darden School of Business asked herself the very same question, and when she couldn’t find any such data, she partnered with Christine DeYoung, partner at DHR International, a leading senior-level executive search, management assessment and succession planning company, to survey executive recruiters who specially place C-level marketers. Their 2016 top 20 list includes 11 CG companies, with P&G at the very top; the second and third spot belong to PepsiCo and Unilever. Here is the full list, as published in Forbes: Best Companies for MBA Marketing Students: Procter & Gamble PepsiCo Unilever Google American Express Coca-Cola General Mills Amazon Apple Starbucks Nike Target Kellogg’s KraftHeinz/Mondelez Macy’s Clorox Johnson & Johnson Verizon Facebook McKinsey & Co./Nestle The survey highlighted that the companies that continually breed and turn out top marketing talent have a few things in common:  1) they invest in their people heavily: training, exposure, and cross-functionally; 2) they invest heavily in Strategic Marketing because they believe in its power to drive results; and 3) “Marketers” are synonymous with general managers versus marketing communication experts. The top marketing companies also teach and expect their brand marketers to holistically drive the P&L, which ultimately is what creates more capable, enterprise-wide leaders, according to DeYoung. In total, the 2016 survey includes executive recruiter responses who represent 19 different firms (including boutique, mid-sized, and large recruiting firms) and have placed over 2600 C-level marketing leaders over the course of their careers.

Anorak Anorak | Manchester United career not enough for Ryan Giggs to land Swansea job Menu Home News Politics Madeleine McCann Strange But True Celebs Film Music TV & Radio Fashion Tech Cars Money The Consumer Sport Flashback Photos Home News Politics Madeleine McCann Strange But True Entertainment Celebs Film Music TV & Radio Life Fashion Tech Cars Money The Consumer Sport Flashback Photos Manchester United career not enough for Ryan Giggs to land Swansea job by Anorak | 4th, October 2016 When Swansea sacked head coach Francesco Guidolin on his 61st birthday too, the British Press all tipped former Manchester United player Ryan Giggs to replace him. Daily Mail columnist Jamie Redknapp said he’d be “amazed” if Giggs didn’t get the job. Giggs didn’t get the job. Swansea’s US-based owners Steve Kaplan, Jason Levein and chairman Huw Jenkins appointed former USA coach Bob Bradley, who leaves Ligue 2 side Le Havre. Bradley was chosen for his “experience and character”. He is the first American coach to work in the Premier League. Giggs, says the Mail, failed his interview. The paper says Giggs “was confident of landing his first permanent post having held an interview with Swans chairman Huw Jenkins last week.” The owners had “concerns about his lack of experience and an underwhelming interview scuppered Giggs’s chances”. Giggs – who has worked as Louis Van Gaal’s Number 2 coach at Manchester United, for whom he played 672 times – lacked experience. Bradley – who never played professionally and has managed the Princeton Tigers, Chicago Fire, Egypt and the USA – has the better CV. It’s not hard to imagine that Bradley, who went to Princeton University and worked in the Procter & Gamble’s executive training program, was better in interview than Giggs, especially those parts when they fire question, like ‘What is 10 per cent of £12.50’ and ‘Can Swansea build a franchise in the USA – discuss?’ and ‘Is it ever OK to high-five a player after-scoring a goal?’ In May 2016, thy Times wrote, “Giggs as Manchester United manager? It will happen one day if he waits patiently enough, rather than risking his reputation elsewhere.” Last questions: Was missing out on the Swansea job a lucky escape?

Newsy Volkswagen shedding 30,000 jobs FRANKFURT, Germany — Automaker Volkswagen said Friday it will shed 30,000 jobs to cut costs as it tries to recover from its diesel emissions scandal and invests more in electric-powered vehicles and digital services. Company officials said that 23,000 of the job cuts will come in Germany. It said the measures will save some 3.7 billion euros ($4 billion) a year from 2020. Around 11 million cars worldwide have the deceptive software. CEO Matthias Mueller said it was "the biggest reform package in the history of our core brand."

Non of the news we've gotten have been terribly encouraging," said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. "Some sort of corrective action, given the [high] valuations wouldn't be surprising and would be healthy for the market." Quotes in the article Henderson Group PLC HNDGF ▲ 2.96 +0.22 +8.03% Deutsche Bank AG DB ▼ 15.86 -0.23 -1.43% The Dow Jones industrial average fell about 100 points in midmorning trade before holding about 60 points lower, with Travelers Companies and UnitedHealth Group contributing the most losses. "The auto sales data were not great," said Chuck Self, CIO at iSectors. "The manufacturing data were not great, either. They're higher, but not running away. I think a lot of this has to do with rally we had Friday." The S&P 500 fell 0.48 percent, with real estate falling more than 1.5 percent to lead decliners. "Things seem to be quiet at the moment. October is usually a rough month for stocks. i guess we're getting a bit of a kickback from Friday, said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Service. The Nasdaq composite slid approximately 0.4 percent. "For me, it could be the return of overbought conditions on Friday. We had a pretty strong session on Friday and that supports a pullback today," said Katie Stockton, chief technical strategist at BTIG. She added, however, that overall short-term momentum remains strong, and that the S&P could break above its all-time intraday high of 2,193.81. "It's a minor level because it hasn't been tested that much. Technical levels are stronger the more you test them," Stockton said. Stocks ended the third quarter on a high note on Friday, rising around 1 percent. In economic news, the September Markit Manufacturing PMI came in at 51.5, a three-month low. "U.S. manufacturers signalled another moderate upturn in both production volumes and incoming new work during September, but the latest survey indicated a further loss of growth momentum from July's recent peak," Markit said. The ISM Manufacturing index for September came in at 51.5, up from 49.4 in the previous month. Construction spending fell 0.7 percent in August, with analysts expecting a 0.2 percent increase. "The market, I think, is becoming more accepting of the fact that [Federal Reserve Chair] Janet Yellen wants to raise interest rates in December," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "But you need the market to be underpinned by growth." "The ISM number came above consensus, and that's positive," she said. Also, Nissan reported its U.S. auto sales rose 4.9 percent in September, beating expectations. Ford reported a sales fall of 8 percent, still better than the expected 8.5 percent. Toyota sales, meanwhile, missed estimates, rising 1.5 percent. General Motors sales fell 0.6 percent, less than expected. Other vehicle sales for September will be released throughout the day. Crude prices rose broadly, with U.S. oil futures settling 1.2 percent higher at $48.81 per barrel, supported by a planned production cut by exporter group OPEC, although analysts cautioned a stubborn supply overhang could temper a longer-lasting rally. Brent prices broke above $50, hitting their highest level since August. The OPEC deal is expected to take effect in November. "If we get a production cut, even if it's small, or even a production freeze, that's the best news we've gotten over the past two years," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. Overseas, European stocks closed mostly flat as investors kept an eye on Deutsche Bank and the U.K. process to leave the European Union. On Friday, U.S. equities had closed sharply higher amid a report that Deutsche Bank was near a settlement with the Justice Department. However, U.S.-listed shares traded 1.9 percent lower Monday with no official deal being announced between Deutsche Bank and the DOJ. British Prime Minister Theresa May said Sunday she'd start the Brexit process in the early part of 2017, a process which is expected to take about two years to complete. The British pound fell about 1 percent against the dollar on Monday, trading at $1.286. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar rose 0.24 percent, with the euro near $1.122 and the yen around 101.54. U.S. Treasurys were mostly lower, with the two-year note yield at 0.794 percent and the benchmark 10-year note yield around 1.62 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 60 points, or 0.35 percent, to 18,244, with Procter & Gamble leading decliners and DuPont the top advancer. The S&P 500 fell 9 points, or 0.42 percent, to 2,159, with utilities all sectors lower. The Nasdaq slid 16 points, or 0.31 percent, to trade at 5,295. About nine stocks declined for every five advancers at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 497 million and a composite volume of 2.324 billion in afternoon trade. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded near 13.8. Gold futures for December delivery fell $4.40 to settle at $1,312.70 per ounce. —CNBC's Matt Clinch and Reuters contributed to this report. On tap this week: *Planner subject to change.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 4 October 2016 | MYT 7:41 AM Wall St dips in slow start to fourth quarter NEW YORK: The fourth quarter got off to a weak start for U.S. stock investors on Monday, with financials, consumer staples and utilities pulling the S&P 500 lower. Major indexes have bounced between gains and losses in the past few days, with investors nervous about the outcome of a tight race for the White House ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Big banks extended recent declines as investors worried about the stability of Deutsche Bank and also Wells Fargo & Co's handling of sales abuses. U.S-listed shares of Deutsche slipped 0.85 percent as hopes faded of a swift deal with U.S. authorities over a multi-billion dollar penalty for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities. "The feeling is there will be a negotiation lowering that penalty but it's certainly a bit of an overhang on the overall market," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. The S&P 500 financial index declined 0.43 percent as Wells Fargo slid 1.02 percent to its lowest since December 2013. Also weighing on investor sentiment was a plan announced by Britain on Sunday to start its separation from the European Union by March. With yields on U.S. Treasury bonds up following stronger-than-expected U.S. manufacturing data for September, the interest-rate sensitive utility sector fell 1.35 percent. The consumer staples index declined 0.6 percent, with Procter & Gamble falling 1.21 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3 percent to end the session at 18,253.85 points and the S&P 500 lost 0.33 percent to 2,161.2. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.21 percent to 5,300.87 points. About 5.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, well below the 7.1 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. S&P 500 companies on average are expected to posts a 0.5 percent dip in third-quarter earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data. That would mark a fifth straight quarter of year-over-year earnings declines, in large part due to weak oil prices. Tesla Motors jumped 4.74 percent after the electric carmaker said third-quarter deliveries rose by 70 percent to 24,500 cars. Cabela's surged 15.02 percent after the retailer said it would be acquired by Bass Pro Shops in a deal valued at about $5.5 billion. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.40-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.40-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 77 new highs and 32 new lows. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Corporate News , Markets , Oil & Gas You May Be Interested Ringgit opens lower against US dollar SC appoints Gumuri as AOB executive chairman Wall St flat at the open; Nasdaq hits record high Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official China badminton star Lin Dan apologises for affair with model while wife was pregnant Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read ‘Sky-high deterrent’ on foreign buying of prewar buildings Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot The Star's executive editor Soo Ewe Jin passes away Property Related advertisement Latest News Opec moves closer to oil output deal as Iran gets new offer Wall St flat at the open; Nasdaq hits record high Prestariang wins RM3.5bil deal to revamp Immigration’s IT system Musa tables RM3.78bil surplus budget for Sabah SC appoints Gumuri as AOB executive chairman Most Viewed in Business Ringgit continues slide Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot Prestariang wins RM3.5bil deal to revamp Immigration’s IT system SC appoints Gumuri as AOB executive chairman Prince Alwaleed sees Saudi currency depeg as last resort Ringgit opens lower against US dollar Musa tables RM3.78bil surplus budget for Sabah MDEC and UOA Holdings to set up gaming hub Ringgit, KLCI continue to fall advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

In a 15-second spot, Burgess scoots into the scene to tell a woman doing laundry to “Unstop right there.” He explains that he’s about to “pop a cap of mmm-fresh in that washer” which will provide a fresh scent which lasts up to 12 weeks. That feels almost as long as unskippable online spots, he adds, with a knowing look at the camera. While the brief spot is unable to live up to the actor’s comedic potential, it still provides more entertainment value than you’d expect from the category. There’s also a full-length version which stretches on for over a minute. If there’s a looseness to the extended version, that’s because Grey New York and Downy let Burgess improvise some of his lines, including an unexpected Shakespeare reference. Just don’t ask him to fold clothes. “Tituss was free to add a lot of his own improvisations to the work, Grey associate creative director Katie Jensen explained to Adweek. “He added the entire section of what we’ll call ‘Downy Hamlet.'” Credits: Advertiser: P&G/Unstopables Agency: Grey New York Chief Creative Officer, Grey New York: Andreas Dahlqvist Executive Creative Director, Grey New York: Lisa Topol Executive Creative Director, Grey New York: Derek Barnes ACD/Art Director, Grey New York: Katie Jensen ACD/Copywriter, Grey New York: Ani Munoz Strategy Director, Grey New York: Justine Feron Strategist, Grey New York: Toni Dawkins EVP/Global Account Director, Grey New York: Caroline Winterton SVP/Global Account Director, Grey New York: Stephanie O’Donnell VP/Account Director, Grey New York: Kelly Norris Account Executive, Grey New York: David Slifer Assistant Account Executive, Grey New York, Alana Goldstein Production Company: Townhouse Townhouse President: Bennett McCarroll Townhouse Head of Integrated Production: James McPherson Townhouse Exec.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad US STOCKS-Wall St dips in slow start to fourth quarter By Reuters Published: 16:35 EST, 3 October 2016 | Updated: 16:35 EST, 3 October 2016 e-mail By Noel Randewich Oct 3 (Reuters) - The fourth quarter got off to a weak start for U.S. stock investors on Monday, with financials, consumer staples and utilities pulling the S&P 500 lower. Major indexes have bounced between gains and losses in the past few days, with investors nervous about the outcome of a tight race for the White House ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Big banks extended recent declines as investors worried about the stability of Deutsche Bank and also Wells Fargo & Co's handling of sales abuses. U.S-listed shares of Deutsche slipped 0.85 percent as hopes faded of a swift deal with U.S. authorities over a multi-billion dollar penalty for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities. "The feeling is there will be a negotiation lowering that penalty but it's certainly a bit of an overhang on the overall market," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. The S&P 500 financial index declined 0.43 percent as Wells Fargo slid 1.02 percent to its lowest since December 2013. Also weighing on investor sentiment was a plan announced by Britain on Sunday to start its separation from the European Union by March. With yields on U.S. Treasury bonds up following stronger-than-expected U.S. manufacturing data for September, the interest-rate sensitive utility sector fell 1.35 percent. The consumer staples index declined 0.6 percent, with Procter & Gamble falling 1.21 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3 percent to end the session at 18,253.85 points and the S&P 500 lost 0.33 percent to 2,161.2. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.21 percent to 5,300.87 points. About 5.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, well below the 7.1 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. S&P 500 companies on average are expected to posts a 0.5 percent dip in third-quarter earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data. That would mark a fifth straight quarter of year-over-year earnings declines, in large part due to weak oil prices. Tesla Motors jumped 4.74 percent after the electric carmaker said third-quarter deliveries rose by 70 percent to 24,500 cars. Cabela's surged 15.02 percent after the retailer said it would be acquired by Bass Pro Shops in a deal valued at about $5.5 billion. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.40-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.40-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 77 new highs and 32 new lows.

Reuters Published Monday, Oct. 03, 2016 4:20PM EDT Last updated Monday, Oct. 03, 2016 5:18PM EDT Comments AA Canada’s main stock index fell on Monday, as major gold miners lost ground and heavyweight banks also pulled back as the federal government tightened mortgage and tax rules in a bid to cool the housing market. The most influential stocks weighing on the index included Goldcorp Inc which fell 4.5 per cent to C$20.68 after it temporarily shut down its Peñasquito gold mine in Mexico due to a week-long blockade by a trucking contractor. Barrick Gold Corp, which is dealing with its own forced shutdown of operations at a mine in Argentina, lost 1.9 per cent to C$22.78. The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 1.8 per cent. “Apart from the trials and tribulations of the giant gold companies which are mostly Canadian, the mining companies are experiencing a growing arrival of free cash flows,” said Michael Smedley, chief portfolio manager at Morgan Meighen & Associates. The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index closed down 36.82 points, or 0.25 per cent, at 14,689.04. Seven of the index’s 10 main groups ended in negative territory. The financials group slipped 0.2 per cent, as Ottawa said it will close a tax loophole and introduce a stress test to insured mortgage lending. Investors were also more cautious as Britain set a March deadline to start its withdrawal from the European Union and worries over Deutsche Bank continued to swirl. Royal Bank of Canada fell 0.4 per cent to C$80.95 and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce lost 0.7 per cent to C$101.01. Shares in fashion retailer Aritzia Inc settled at C$17.71 in their market debut, after they were priced at C$16 last week. The energy sector gained 0.6 per cent as Brent settled above $50 a barrel for the first time since August and U.S. crude hit three-month highs, after Iran exhorted the need for other oil producers to join OPEC in supporting the market. Shares in Spectral Medical Inc slumped 85 per cent to 24 Canadian cents after it said its experimental treatment for sepsis – a common, often deadly complication of infection – failed a late-stage study, stymieing the company’s plans to bring to market the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved device for the condition. Wall St dips in slow start to fourth quarter The fourth quarter got off to a weak start for U.S. stock investors on Monday, with financials, consumer staples and utilities pulling the S&P 500 lower. Major indexes have bounced between gains and losses in the past few days, with investors nervous about the outcome of a tight race for the White House ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Big banks extended recent declines as investors worried about the stability of Deutsche Bank and also Wells Fargo & Co’s handling of sales abuses. U.S-listed shares of Deutsche slipped 0.85 per cent as hopes faded of a swift deal with U.S. authorities over a multi-billion dollar penalty for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities. “The feeling is there will be a negotiation lowering that penalty but it’s certainly a bit of an overhang on the overall market,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. The S&P 500 financial index declined 0.43 per cent as Wells Fargo slid 1.02 per cent to its lowest since December 2013. Also weighing on investor sentiment was a plan announced by Britain on Sunday to start its separation from the European Union by March. With yields on U.S. Treasury bonds up following stronger-than-expected U.S. manufacturing data for September, the interest-rate sensitive utility sector fell 1.35 per cent. The consumer staples index declined 0.6 per cent, with Procter & Gamble falling 1.21 per cent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3 per cent to end the session at 18,253.85 points and the S&P 500 lost 0.33 per cent to 2,161.2. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.21 per cent to 5,300.87 points. About 5.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, well below the 7.1 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. S&P 500 companies on average are expected to posts a 0.5 per cent dip in third-quarter earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data. That would mark a fifth straight quarter of year-over-year earnings declines, in large part due to weak oil prices. Tesla Motors jumped 4.74 per cent after the electric carmaker said third-quarter deliveries rose by 70 per cent to 24,500 cars. Cabela’s surged 15.02 per cent after the retailer said it would be acquired by Bass Pro Shops in a deal valued at about $5.5-billion. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.40-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.40-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 77 new highs and 32 new lows.

She will become chief creative officer at the latter agency as of December 1. In a statement, Mother founding partner and creative chairman Paul Malmstrom said: “We feel Corinna belongs here at Mother. She has a magical mix of talent, ambition, and soulfulness With her, we’ll continue to bring even greater expressions of creativity to our clients.” CEO Peter Ravailhe added: “With her relentless pursuit of excellence, in craft and creativity, Corinna will add incredible value to the brands we love to work with, and to Mother as a whole.” An Ogilvy representative declined to comment on Falusi’s departure, but a source close to the agency told us it has begun seeking her successor and that it will search both internally and externally for its next creative leader. Prior to today’s announcement, Mother New York hired three new creatives to work across its client roster with a focus on the Target and Stella Artois accounts. Falusi started her agency career at her native Germany’s Jung Von Matt before moving to StrawberryFrog, where she spent nearly a decade in Amsterdam and New York and worked on accounts ranging from P&G to Frito Lay. She joined Ogilvy in 2012, and last January the WPP shop promoted her to replace former CCO Calle Sjoenell, who left two summers ago to run Lowe Brindfors in Sweden. While serving as chief creative officer over the past year-plus, Falusi continued to run the Coca-Cola and IKEA accounts while also “driv[ing] the creative vision of the New York agency.” The release does not elaborate on specific reasons for her departure, but we did acquire the internal email announcement that went out to all New York Ogilvy staff on Friday via North American CCO Steve Simpson and New York CEO Lou Aversano. It reads: CORINNA FALUSI Four years ago, Corinna Falusi joined Ogilvy. From her very first day, Corinna began to pour all of her passion and energy into the work and into her relationships with all of us. And she continued to do this every day, without fail. Today, one thousand six hundred and fourteen days later, we regret to announce that Corinna has decided to leave us to take on new and different challenges. We can feel sad about this—nobody who worked with her can help it—but the most important thing to do is thank her: for her work, her mentorship and her partnership, which she gave to us fully for over four years, every single day. We will miss Corinna’s special spirit and point of view, but we are lucky to have incredible and passionate creative leaders. Kristy, Alfonso, and Teddy will be gathering the creative department together to discuss our path forward.

Ogg October 3, 2016 10:50 am EST Print Email Tweet It is no secret at all that investors love dividends. Companies raising dividends continuously are even more sought after than those just paying the same old dividend year in and year out. It is frequently mentioned that roughly half of all total returns through time come from dividends. As the third quarter has given way to the fourth quarter of 2016, the reality is that this bull market is seven and a half years old. Valuations are relatively high in the broad market, and there is growing evidence that some companies may not be able to keep raising dividends endlessly. In an effort to make sure investors do not go after the wrong dividend-paying companies, 24/7 Wall St. has reviewed many dividends. We have found seven Dow Jones Industrial Average companies and identified 14 S&P 500 companies that have raised dividends for 25 years or more that can likely keep raising their dividends. After looking at the big picture, there are actually four Dow member companies that have increased their dividends for 50 consecutive years. Being a Dividend Aristocrat means that a company has hiked dividends for 25 years straight. Perhaps companies that have hiked their dividend for 50 years or more should be called the Dividend Deities. Here are four Dow stocks that have raised their dividends for 50 years or more, and that also appear to be able to keep raising their dividends in the years ahead. 3M Co. (NYSE: MMM) has a lot more going for it than the Post-It note, and it has raised dividends for roughly two decades longer than it has been selling the Post-It note. The conglomerate has a dividend yield of about 2.5%, but its 99-straight-year dividend history has seen an increase to annual dividend for 57 consecutive years. Despite years of hiking, 3M only recently has become more aggressive on dividends. To prove the point, 19 of the 30 Dow stocks outyield the conglomerate. Shares of 3M last closed at $175.33, with a consensus analyst price target of $181.73 and a 52-week trading range of $134.64 to $182.27. The company has a total market cap of $106 billion. For some time Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) has been diversifying away from sugary drinks, and that goes far beyond diet sodas with artificial sweeteners. It has large water operations, as well as sports and specialty beverages, now. The beverage giant yields 3.3% and it has paid a dividend for longer than most of us have lived. Its consecutive time frame is 54 years with dividend hikes — with plenty of room for hikes ahead. Coca-Cola also pays the eighth highest yields of the 30 Dow stocks. Its shares recently closed at $42.31. The consensus price target is $47.17, and the 52-week range is $40.43 to $47.13. Coca-Cola’s market cap is $181 billion. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) is sort of like Old Faithful in that it just keeps spewing money into the air for investors each year. Perhaps there is something to be said for sticking with a mantra of being in health care products and pharmaceuticals and in consumer products at the same time. The yield is now 2.7%. The company has a 54 consecutive years of hikes, but its position among the 30 Dow dividends is just number 17. Johnson & Johnson shares last closed at $118.00, within a 52-week range of $92.58 to $126.07. The consensus price target is $126.61. The market cap is $322 billion. Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) may have been restructuring its consumer products portfolio for a while (just finalized a Coty deal), but it has so far never buckled under the competitive and ever-changing landscape of retail. It has paid a dividend for 126 consecutive years now, but 2016 marked the 60th consecutive year that it has increased that dividend. The current yield is 3.0%m which ranks as the 12th highest dividend of the 30 Dow stocks. Shares of Procter & Gamble recently closed at $89.37, in a 52-week range of $72.50 to $90.22. The market cap is $237 billion. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   While other dividend aristocrats might or might not be able to pay ever higher dividends year in and year out, there are many other companies close behind these four Dow stocks. Some of these other soon-to-be Dividend Deities are not Dow stocks but the likes of Target, PepsiCo, Sysco Foods, Kimberly-Clark, Consolidated Edison, Becton Dickinson, and ADP — as well as Dow component McDonald’s. They have all paid out higher and higher dividends for 40 consecutive years or more. By Jon C.

"I think the market is still looking for inspiration. Non of the news we've gotten have been terribly encouraging," said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. "Some sort of corrective action, given the [high] valuations wouldn't be surprising and would be healthy for the market." The Dow Jones industrial average fell 104.40 points at session lows before closing about 55 points lower, with Travelers Companies and UnitedHealth Group contributing the most losses. "The auto sales data were not great," said Chuck Self, CIO at iSectors. "The manufacturing data were not great, either. They're higher, but not running away. I think a lot of this has to do with rally we had Friday." The S&P 500 fell 0.3 percent, with real estate falling 1.8 percent to lead decliners. "Things seem to be quiet at the moment. October is usually a rough month for stocks. i guess we're getting a bit of a kickback from Friday, said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Service. The Nasdaq composite slid 0.21 percent. "For me, it could be the return of overbought conditions on Friday. We had a pretty strong session on Friday and that supports a pullback today," said Katie Stockton, chief technical strategist at BTIG. She added, however, that overall short-term momentum remains strong, and that the S&P could break above its all-time intraday high of 2,193.81. "It's a minor level because it hasn't been tested that much. Technical levels are stronger the more you test them," Stockton said. Stocks ended the third quarter on a high note on Friday, rising around 1 percent. Getty Images Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. In economic news, the September Markit Manufacturing PMI came in at 51.5, a three-month low. "U.S. manufacturers signalled another moderate upturn in both production volumes and incoming new work during September, but the latest survey indicated a further loss of growth momentum from July's recent peak," Markit said. The ISM Manufacturing index for September came in at 51.5, up from 49.4 in the previous month. Construction spending fell 0.7 percent in August, with analysts expecting a 0.2 percent increase. "The market, I think, is becoming more accepting of the fact that [Federal Reserve Chair] Janet Yellen wants to raise interest rates in December," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "But you need the market to be underpinned by growth." "The ISM number came above consensus, and that's positive," she said. Also, Nissan reported its U.S. auto sales rose 4.9 percent in September, beating expectations. Ford reported a sales fall of 8 percent, still better than the expected 8.5 percent. Toyota sales, meanwhile, missed estimates, rising 1.5 percent. General Motors sales fell 0.6 percent, less than expected. Other vehicle sales for September will be released throughout the day. Crude prices rose broadly, with U.S. oil futures settling 1.2 percent higher at $48.81 per barrel, supported by a planned production cut by exporter group OPEC, although analysts cautioned a stubborn supply overhang could temper a longer-lasting rally. Brent prices broke above $50, hitting their highest level since August. The OPEC deal is expected to take effect in November. "If we get a production cut, even if it's small, or even a production freeze, that's the best news we've gotten over the past two years," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. Overseas, European stocks closed mostly flat as investors kept an eye on Deutsche Bank and the U.K. process to leave the European Union. On Friday, U.S. equities had closed sharply higher amid a report that Deutsche Bank was near a settlement with the Justice Department. However, U.S.-listed shares traded 1.9 percent lower Monday with no official deal being announced between Deutsche Bank and the DOJ. British Prime Minister Theresa May said Sunday she'd start the Brexit process in the early part of 2017, a process which is expected to take about two years to complete. The British pound fell about 1 percent against the dollar on Monday, trading at $1.285. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar rose 0.24 percent, with the euro near $1.121 and the yen around 101.61. U.S. Treasurys were mostly lower, with the two-year note yield at 0.794 percent and the benchmark 10-year note yield around 1.6187 percent. Symbol Name Price   Change %Change DJIA --- S&P 500 --- NASDAQ --- The Dow Jones industrial average fell 54.30 points, or 0.30 percent, to close at 18,253.85, with Travelers Companies leading decliners and DuPont the top advancer. The S&P 500 fell 7.07 points, or 0.33 percent, to end at 2,161.20, with real estate leading eight sectors lower and telecommunications the greatest riser. The Nasdaq slid 11.13 points, or 0.21 percent, to close at 5,300.87. About nine stocks declined for every three advancers at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 809.11 million and a composite volume of 3.060 billion at the close. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded near 13.57.

Allied Market Research Logo     Facebook Twitter Pinterest Allied Market Research Logo PORTLAND, Oregon, October 3, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- A new report published by Allied Market Research, titled, "Personal Care Electrical Appliances Market: Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2014-2022", projects that the world personal care electrical appliances market is expected to reach $28,007 million by 2022. The hair care appliances segment is estimated to dominate this market throughout 2016 - 2022. North America accounted for around two-fifths share of the market in 2015.      (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140911/647229 ) Summary Personal Care Electrical Appliances Market can be accessed on the website at https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/personal-care-electrical-appliances-market   Growth in ageing population, improving economic conditions, increasing awareness regarding personal grooming, inclination towards automation, and growing online sales are factors that drive the market growth. In addition, growing urban population and increasing demand from untapped markets such as Asia-Pacific and LAMEA are anticipated to further drive the demand for the personal care electrical appliances market. However, lack of durability and high cost of the products limit the market growth. The hair care appliances segment accounted for over two-fifths of the global personal care electrical appliances market in 2015, owing to the influence of western lifestyle on the population of developing and untapped regions. The hair straightener sub-segment was the leading revenue contributor to the global hair care appliances market in 2014, accounting for more than 43% share, and is further expected to dominate the market throughout the forecast period, growing at a CAGR of 7.1% from 2016 to 2022. The hair stylers segment is the fastest growing market, registering a CAGR of 10.0% from 2016 to 2022. This is attributed to growing inclination of women towards styled hair rather than straightening. Trimmer was the leading revenue contributor to the global hair removal appliances segment owing to its established market status and historical trend of trimmed beard. Epilators and shavers together contributed around 47% share in 2014 and would grow at a CAGR of 10.2% and 10.8% respectively during the forecast period. Epilators have a different mode of action as that of shavers. They do not remove the hair from surface, rather pluck off hair strands from their roots. This gives a permanent solution as compared to shaving. Therefore, men use shavers for facial hair, whereas women prefer epilators. The availability of substitute products, such as hair removal creams, and others act as replacements for epilators; thereby, limiting their growth. Consumers shift from creams and other hair removal methods to epilators is expected to be gradual in untapped markets of the Asia-Pacific and LAMEA regions. Electric toothbrush is the primary product under the oral care appliance segment that dominates the market. Plaque removers are electric toothbrushes with a rotatory brush head especially made to remove plaque. Plaque removers have gained importance among people with periodontal issues, while the device is not common among buyers. In 2014, powered toothbrush was the leading revenue generator in the oral care segment, and is projected to dominate the market throughout the analysis period. Personal care electrical appliances are used by both men and women. Female buyers have a higher share in hair care products, whereas males dominate the shavers market. The female customers segment is expected to outpace the male customers segment in the near future. However, the male customers segment would generate a notable revenue by 2022 growing at a CAGR of 8.6% during the forecast period. According to Deepankar Bose, Research Manager, Consumer Goods at AMR, "The world personal care electrical appliances market is anticipated to witness steady demand in developed regions on account of early adoption of premium lifestyle and awareness regarding personal grooming. However, individuals in developing regions are inclined towards hair care technology such as stylers and straighteners, which would further fuel the demand." The small domestic equipment market is the parent market for personal care electrical appliances, and the prevailing trend in this business area has a similar impact on the personal care market. The global market for personal care electrical personal care appliances has witnessed steady growth, and is expected to maintain this trend throughout the forecast period. The Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and Africa are expected to exhibit incremental growth during the forecast period due to growing awareness and rising disposable income. Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC) are the countries with the highest growth potential during the forecast period. As per the present market scenario, North America generated the highest revenue in 2014, accounting for around two-fifths of the market value, and is expected to dominate the market throughout the analysis period. Asia-Pacific is projected to be the fastest growing market registering a CAGR of 13.4% from 2016 to 2022. Key findings of the study:  In the year 2014-2015, hair care appliances segment led the overall personal care electrical appliances market revenue, and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 7.7%. Oral care appliances is expected to be the third highest revenue-generating segment by 2022 and would grow at the highest CAGR of 11.4% during the forecast period. Hair stylers is anticipated to be the fastest growing market segment for the hair care appliances market and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 10%. North America generated the highest revenue, among all regions in 2014, and would dominate the market throughout the forecast period. The key players in the personal care electrical appliances market focus on expanding their business operations in the emerging countries with new product launch as their preferred strategy. The major players profiled in this report include Remington Products Company, Procter and Gamble (Braun GmbH/Oral B), Conair Corp., Royal Philips Electronics NV, Panasonic Corporation, Groupe SEB, Colgate-Palmolive, Helen of Troy L.P, HoMedics Inc., and LION Corp.

In addition, growing urban population and increasing demand from untapped markets such as Asia-Pacific and LAMEA are anticipated to further drive the demand for the personal care electrical appliances market. However, lack of durability and high cost of the products limit the market growth. The hair care appliances segment accounted for over two-fifths of the global personal care electrical appliances market in 2015, owing to the influence of western lifestyle on the population of developing and untapped regions. The hair straightener sub-segment was the leading revenue contributor to the global hair care appliances market in 2014, accounting for more than 43% share, and is further expected to dominate the market throughout the forecast period, growing at a CAGR of 7.1% from 2016 to 2022. The hair stylers segment is the fastest growing market, registering a CAGR of 10.0% from 2016 to 2022. This is attributed to growing inclination of women towards styled hair rather than straightening. Trimmer was the leading revenue contributor to the global hair removal appliances segment owing to its established market status and historical trend of trimmed beard. Epilators and shavers together contributed around 47% share in 2014 and would grow at a CAGR of 10.2% and 10.8% respectively during the forecast period. Epilators have a different mode of action as that of shavers. They do not remove the hair from surface, rather pluck off hair strands from their roots. This gives a permanent solution as compared to shaving. Therefore, men use shavers for facial hair, whereas women prefer epilators. The availability of substitute products, such as hair removal creams, and others act as replacements for epilators; thereby, limiting their growth. Consumers shift from creams and other hair removal methods to epilators is expected to be gradual in untapped markets of the Asia-Pacific and LAMEA regions. Electric toothbrush is the primary product under the oral care appliance segment that dominates the market. Plaque removers are electric toothbrushes with a rotatory brush head especially made to remove plaque. Plaque removers have gained importance among people with periodontal issues, while the device is not common among buyers. In 2014, powered toothbrush was the leading revenue generator in the oral care segment, and is projected to dominate the market throughout the analysis period. Personal care electrical appliances are used by both men and women. Female buyers have a higher share in hair care products, whereas males dominate the shavers market. The female customers segment is expected to outpace the male customers segment in the near future. However, the male customers segment would generate a notable revenue by 2022 growing at a CAGR of 8.6% during the forecast period. According to Deepankar Bose, Research Manager, Consumer Goods at AMR, "The world personal care electrical appliances market is anticipated to witness steady demand in developed regions on account of early adoption of premium lifestyle and awareness regarding personal grooming. However, individuals in developing regions are inclined towards hair care technology such as stylers and straighteners, which would further fuel the demand." The small domestic equipment market is the parent market for personal care electrical appliances, and the prevailing trend in this business area has a similar impact on the personal care market. The global market for personal care electrical personal care appliances has witnessed steady growth, and is expected to maintain this trend throughout the forecast period. The Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and Africa are expected to exhibit incremental growth during the forecast period due to growing awareness and rising disposable income. Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC) are the countries with the highest growth potential during the forecast period. As per the present market scenario, North America generated the highest revenue in 2014, accounting for around two-fifths of the market value, and is expected to dominate the market throughout the analysis period. Asia-Pacific is projected to be the fastest growing market registering a CAGR of 13.4% from 2016 to 2022. Key findings of the study:  In the year 2014-2015, hair care appliances segment led the overall personal care electrical appliances market revenue, and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 7.7%. Oral care appliances is expected to be the third highest revenue-generating segment by 2022 and would grow at the highest CAGR of 11.4% during the forecast period. Hair stylers is anticipated to be the fastest growing market segment for the hair care appliances market and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 10%. North America generated the highest revenue, among all regions in 2014, and would dominate the market throughout the forecast period. The key players in the personal care electrical appliances market focus on expanding their business operations in the emerging countries with new product launch as their preferred strategy.

Published on October 03, 2016. Credit: Mobile Marketing Association Marketers should spend more on mobile: Just ask the Mobile Marketing Association. That claim is no surprise coming from the industry's trade group, and might even provoke eye rolls. But there's a key reason to believe the MMA, backed by its cross-device Smart Mobile Cross Marketing Effectiveness (SMoX) research, as the group's CEO, Greg Stuart, sees it: His board is made up of nearly two-thirds marketers -- including executives of Coca-Cola Co. and Unilever -- who have closely supervised and participated in the work. Unilever, whose Magnum ice cream brand is the focus of the latest SMoX study, is putting credence in the results and putting them to use, said Luis Di Como, Unilever senior VP-global media, who sits on the MMA board. "We have advertisers. We have mobile players. We have Facebook as well," said Mr. Di Como. "We have a good industry representation." Related Stories Mobile Data Marketplace Creates Direct Path From App to Dollars Google's Attack on Mobile Interstitials Provokes That Familiar Mix of Applause and Fear 'Campaign' Is a Dirty Word in Mobile Creativity MMA research has been vetted independently by the Advertising Research Foundation, Mr. Stuart noted. And its studies have been conducted with large panels of between 500,000 and 1 million consumers under the supervision of well-regarded marketing analytics firm Marketing Evolution. The eight published SMoX studies to date, conducted since 2014 with such marketers as Walmart, Coca-Cola, Mastercard and AT&T, concluded that all the marketers would have fared better -- either selling more products or converting more customers -- by increasing mobile media's share of their media budgets to the 15%-to-20% range from 5% to 9%, Mr. Stuart said. Somewhat ironically, the one mobile player in that group -- AT&T -- had the lowest mobile share of spending going into its study, he said. "Mobile is priced at half its value," Mr. Stuart said, based on the sales or conversion impact per dollar spent. That's not to say the gains will hold up if marketers pile their whole budgets into mobile. Marketing Evolution CEO Rex Briggs has pointed out in numerous interviews and presentations that optimal spending on mobile tends to top out at much lower levels than other media, because it doesn't take as much frequency to make an impact as other media. Saturation point Mr. Stuart said a mobile video ad only needs to hit its target three times to reach "total saturation," versus a frequency of 12 to 15 for cable TV. While it's not entirely clear why similar video advertising works and wears out faster in mobile than cable, it does raise questions about whether what counts as an impression is really equal between the media, and whether, for all the concern about digital viewability, concern should perhaps be greater about TV viewability. Of course, comparing mobile and TV is also complicated by the relative complexity of mobile. Where TV spending comes largely on 15- and 30-second ads, mobile encompasses display, video, native and search with parameters that include place and time. Part of SMoX has been looking at optimizing budgets not just by total weight, but also by type of mobile creative and targeting variables. Mobile Delivered About Twice the Impact Per Dollar Versus Other Media AT&T: Awareness of Moto X Phone Mobile: 1.9 Average: 1.0 Gold Peak Tea: Awareness of Gold Peak Tea Mobile: 4.8 Average: 1.0 Mastercard: Image: Use of MC when traveling Mobile: 1.7 Average: 1.0 Walmart: Sales in Store at Walmart Mobile: 2.0 Average: 1.0 Unilever, Magnum: Sales Mobile: 1.1 Average: 1.0 Coca-Cola (Brazil): Sales Mobile: 3.0 Average: 1.0 Coca-Cola (China): Sales Mobile: 2.0 Average: 1.0 Coca-Cola (U.K.): Sales Mobile: 2.0 Average: 1.0 Source: SMoX: A Few Key Insights, September 2016. Photos courtesy of Coca-Cola, Unilever, Walmart, Mastercard and AT&T. Optimizing by total mobile weight increased campaign performance -- either sales or other branding and conversion metrics -- by 4% to 12% (not counting a puzzling outlier from Coca-Cola in Brazil where sales rose a whopping 60%). But optimizing around creative type, location or other factors such as weather increased campaign impact 7% to 25%. The impact in one unpublished study from Subway was even higher, Mr. Stuart said. Mobile ads that the fast-feeder ran between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. had a whopping 14 times more sales impact than those run the rest of the day, he said. For Mr. Di Como, the key takeaway from the SMoX study of Unilever's Magnum ice cream brand was that "context boosts content," he said. The study looked at small and large bannerads and 15- and 30-second mobile video displayed mostly in apps from April to September 2015, using weather, location and time-based targeting. The study found increasing mobile's share of the media mix to 15% from the single digits would increase overall campaign profit performance 9%, and optimizing the creative and targeting within mobile would mean 17% of the media budget in mobile, with a 13% increase in profit versus the unoptimized mix. Using weather-based targeting to only serve the ice cream ads when the temperature was 80 degrees or higher increased aided awareness of the ad by 14% and profit ROI on investment by 50%. The study also found larger banners worked better than smaller ones, and that while mobile video was as effective as cable TV per impression, cable TV was 2.5 times more expensive. In video, 15-second ads proved 27% more effective than 30-second ones. Rich-media surprise But the most effective format actually was rich-media display -- a format that's fallen out of favor with many advertisers in recent years as they turned to video, often repurposed from their TV ads. Rich-media ads had four times the ROI of the campaign overall. While weather and location are clearly major factors for ice cream, Mr. Di Como said the study has implications for other brands as well. Hellmann's, for example, has found ads that run from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. are most effective, because that's when people are deciding what recipes they're going to use that evening. Mobile may still not be the biggest piece of most brands' budgets, but it is "at the center of our communication plans," Mr. Di Como said. "Our mantra is no mobile, no meeting," so that any media or creative provider has to include it in the conversation. But is it possible to get too targeted? Procter & Gamble Global Brand Officer Marc Pritchard recently said the company had done just that with Facebook and pulled back to more broad-reach plans on the social network. "Facebook provides all different ranges of targeting capabilities, from mass reach to hypertargeting, and we use both," Mr. Di Como said. Despite the power of weather and geolocation, along with personalized ads for Magnum, he said, the brand also has found it needs broader-reach mobile advertising to maximize its results. A recent ARF study found a considerable amount of digital and mobile advertising wasted by overkill -- basically serving the same ad to the same people to the point of diminishing or even negative returns. The relatively low cost and fast wearout makes that risk particularly acute in mobile. But Mr. Di Como believes the ability to use frequency caps in mobile buys in order to prevent oversaturating people -- a capability that Google said at Advertising Week it is introducing across devices -- actually makes it better than TV. "You can use frequency caps in the digital environment," he said, "where you can't do that in the traditional TV environment." Realistically, mobile and digital change so fast that the half-life of any research can be short. Only a few years ago, Unilever was focused on campaigns that were "social by design" to get organic, i.e., unpaid, reach. "We were one of the first ones to find there was a decay on that model," Mr. Di Como said. That came largely because of changes in Facebook's algorithm for serving brands' posts to followers. It puts a lot more emphasis on paying for mobile rather than maximizing free reach. At the same time, as Unilever spends more money on mobile, getting measurement right gets more important. So with Facebook in particular, Mr. Di Como said, "We were the first one to push to have third-party verification." So when Facebook announced recently that its own metrics had overstated average time spent viewing videos in recent years, Unilever wasn't surprised, because it had been getting its own viewership data from Moat, he said. "We have been working with Moat and Facebook in an open and supportive way," Mr. Di Como said, "to understand all of these viewability standards."

The markets in China, South Korea and Malaysia were closed for public holidays. Japanese shares rallied as easing fears over Deutsche Bank's health helped to improve investors' risk appetite.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) made the announcement after market hours on Friday, 30 September 2016. Meanwhile, India's manufacturing upturn was sustained in September, as a further increase in order books underpinned growth of output and purchasing activity, a survey showed today, 3 October 2016. That said, rates of expansion eased in all cases. One area of strength was external demand, with firms noting the strongest rise in new export orders since July 2015. Both input costs and output charges increased at quicker rates. Posting above the crucial 50 threshold for the ninth consecutive month, the seasonally adjusted Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 52.1 in September from 52.6 in August.

Capital Market Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Market holds firm Firmness prevailed on the bourses in mid-afternoon trade as the key benchmark indices held onto strong gains after hitting fresh intraday in mid-afternoon trade.

The Bank of Japan's tankan survey released today, 3 October 2016 showed Japan's large manufacturers now expect their pretax profit to drop 14.6% in this financial year through March, compared with a previous forecast for a 11.6% fall. Meanwhile, activity in China's manufacturing sector expanded again in September, data released on 1 October 2016 showed.

Pictured (left to right) are committe members Ron Chester, Tricia Allison and John and Lis Smale, holding their prize for winning the competition. Picture: James Hardisty. Chris Berry 10:06 Monday 03 October 2016 0 Have your say When Katharine Henrietta Venezia Grey gave the residents of Sutton on the Forest their own village hall in 1926 it came with a restrictive covenant that if it ever ceased to be used by the villagers it would revert back to the ownership of Sutton Park, the community’s best-known landmark other than All Hallows Church. That situation is extremely unlikely to take place as the current committee that manages The Grey Village Hall, named after Katharine, have transformed what had become a dark and inhospitable venue into the latest recipient of Hambleton Council’s Village Hall of the Year. Tricia Allison came to the village 30 years ago and has been a member of the village hall committee since 2008. She tells of how Sutton on the Forest has developed in that time. “Times have changed since we came here. In those days there wasn’t a huge amount of movement from homes in the village. That’s now very different and we have become a dormitory village for York and Leeds. There were five farms and now there’s only one. We’ve lost our garage, post office, village shop and butcher’s shop. In more recent times we’ve also gone down to just one pub. The Blackwell Ox closed leaving us with just The Rose & Crown. “Thirty years ago there was no Clifton Moor with its massive Tesco and there was no Monk Cross Shopping Centre. We’re fortunate to have two vibrant community-run shops in Huby and Stillington both within a couple of miles but they wouldn’t be as viable if every village in the area had one so we’re grateful that although we’ve missed the boat ourselves theirs are working well. “I’ve always believed that the village hall is important to the community and what I really wanted was to transform it into what it is now, somewhere accessible and available for all of the village to come together for meetings and activities. “It was leaking and cold. Keeping the hall warm was simply impossible and something had to be done to reduce running costs. The heating bill alone cost £3,000 a year and even then most who used it were still in their coats in winter. Nobody really wanted to come to what was a dark coffin-like place where you could freeze.” The transformation into a light, well-heated and well- used hall has been brought about with a new kitchen, new heating, new decor and the establishment of a false roof - a project costing almost £50,000. The committee has been responsible for obtaining grants and raising other funds as well as managing the project. There was another village hero too, someone who would never know of the work but who lived in the community for many years. “The ladies of the committee have raised considerable monies through events in the hall,” says John Smale who is on the committee with his wife Lis. “Helen Smith from the village helped considerably and Nicky Smith of Hambleton Council aided the ladies in their efforts. Yorventure were responsible for the kitchen but another real village hero is someone many of us will never have known. Charles Cook who worked on the railways as an engineer left a legacy to the Parish Council and we were able to bid for some of that money towards the hall improvements. Without Charles we would have taken longer to reach the figure we needed.” The story of the hall saw another link while the false roof was being put in. “I was chatting with two of the chaps undertaking the work and the younger of them told me his great uncle, who was one of the farmers in the village at the time, had been the man who had originally transported the timber from Tollerton railway station on his farm carts to build it.” Sutton on the Forest’s other amenities include a Church of England Primary School attended by around 100 pupils, the pretty All Hallows Church, playing fields and children’s play area run by a Playing Fields Association and The Rose & Crown pub that the village hall committee is keen to see remain as such. The Village Hall of the Year trophy picked up by The Grey Village Hall this year has taken pride of place inside a clear Perspex cabinet in the hall for all to see.

Published on October 03, 2016. Reprints Reprints Corinna Falusi. Credit: Mother Most Popular Mother New York has hired Ogilvy & Mather New York Chief Creative Officer Corinna Falusi as CCO and partner, effective Dec 1. Paul Malmstrom, founding partner and CCO at Mother New York, is shifting to the role of creative chairman. Ms. Falusi, who was promoted from executive creative director to New York CCO at Ogilvy in January 2015, will be responsible for all creative at Mother New York. Mr. Malmstrom will still play a creative role at the agency, but his new post will allow him to have more flexibility and select specific projects to focus on, according to a Mother New York spokesperson. During her time at Ogilvy New York, Ms. Falusi worked on big-name accounts including Coke Zero, Coca-Cola, Amex OPEN, Tiffany and Ikea. "We feel Corinna belongs here at Mother," Mr. Malmstrom said in a statement. "She has a magical mix of talent, ambition, and soulfulness. With her, we'll continue to bring even greater expressions of creativity to our clients." Prior to Ogilvy, Ms. Falusi worked at smaller creative shops StrawberryFrog, in Amsterdam as well as New York, and Jung Von Matt in Hamburg. There she helped work on a portfolio including brands such as New Balance, Frito-Lay, Heineken, P&G's Pampers, Audi, BMW and MTV. "It has been a joy having Corinna lead our creative department for the past year," an Ogilvy & Mather spokeswoman said. "We wish her all the best on her next chapter at Mother." Last September, former professional rugby player Peter Ravailhe joined Mother New York as CEO, succeeding Andrew Deitchman, who left to pursue an opportunity with a media and retail concept.

Reprints Reprints 20161003_Last Word_martech Credit: Kelsey Dake Most Popular Here's a neat party trick if we're ever in the same room and you want to see my eyes roll all the way into the back of my head and my entire body shut down as if I were some sort of robot that's just been unplugged. Turn to our glossary on page 16. See those words? Just start using any of them and I'm done for. To be fair, if you're a creative and you start using some of your made-up creative words like ideate, or you turn concept into a verb, I'll shut down, too. But I'm a creativist at heart. (See, I can make up words, too. Creationist was already taken.) I like smart branding campaigns. I think companies still have to cast a wide net to reach a wide target to convince people beyond power users to sample their wares. Hell, I like seeing a good 30-second spot—as rare as those are—plopped into the middle of my broadcast or cable TV. But I also get the quest for extremely precise targeting, the desire for automation and that basic need to feel like you're spending your marketing dollars on something that delivers concrete results. It's just that marketing tech works so hard to be boring. Part of me wants to make some clever analogy along the lines that obsessing over marketing tech is like obsessing over whether your TV picture is delivered by tubes or diodes. But the analogy doesn't hold up. And it's just wrongheaded: based partly on my resistance to technology taking over everything and partly on the fact that it's all just so damn confusing. As a writer, even I can admit that sometimes words fail. And you can pile up all the right words in just the right order and the workings of programmatic and marketing tech don't become any clearer. Even after you strip away all the acronyms and the jargon. And please don't point to the Lumascape. The Lumascape is not helpful, unless further confusing the issue is considered helpful. Hey. We took all the companies working in the space and put their names and logos on a piece of paper. Now do you get it? No. Hell, it wasn't until Rubicon Project's Jay Sears came to the office and drew pictures and flowcharts for us that it started to seep into my thick skull. It doesn't exactly get the blood racing. But it is fascinating in its own way. And it's something we'll be covering more and more, because it's also important. At the heart of all this, of course, is data. Despite what latter-day Don Drapers will tell you, marketing's always been data-obsessed. And while we've gotten better and better at collecting and storing data, the issue now is what to do with it, how to sift through it and use it and, just as important, how to keep it safe. And this needs to be done in a calm, collected manner without trying to instill fear or confusion in the hearts of marketers. That's another reason I don't like the Lumascape. I feel like there's an implied message that you should be totally overwhelmed by the topic and go running to the nearest consultant for help. "There's so much noise around ad tech, martech," Neustar CEO Lisa Hook recently told me when she and CMO Steven Wolfe Pereira stopped by Ad Age HQ. I'd asked her about the Lumascape, all those companies making up an entire universe. "They're products or product fragments," she said, adding that that isn't necessarily a bad thing. "It's a green-field environment. Let a thousand flowers bloom." But she does see that universe shrinking. "In three or four years I don't really see anybody talking about martech or ad tech." Yes, the money is still flowing into marketing tech. In a recent Wall Street Journal piece, Jack Marshall noted that PitchBook data showed that venture capital investment for martech companies reached over $1.2 billion last year and is expected to surpass that this year. But, Marshall pointed out, "For many marketing and ad tech companies, the goal is to ultimately sell to a larger player." Hook, who's got a legal background, a thing for good grammar and a sly sense of humor, didn't even use the phrase martech until I brought it up, causing her to roll her eyes. "We hate the descriptor," she said. She sees her own company as in the information-services space. Which is not a surprise considering it sits on so much of it. The company got its start managing the North American Numbering Plan—in other words, all the phone numbers on the continent. It's also the registry operator for .biz and .us, among others. And it provides DNS services. And after a string of acquisitions in the early 2000s, it moved into marketing and security services, everything from fraud protection to targeting to data onboarding and analytics. "At some point, we realized marketing is going to absolutely need to know who they're talking to." For a creativist like myself, it all sounds vaguely scary. You think about all the data out there and all the companies moving it around, where do you even start? How many pieces do you need to stitch together? "To be successful as a marketer today, I have to run an IT department, and I'm going to be so distracted," said Hook. "It's like a Rube Goldberg machine for marketing. It's crazy." The smart marketer isn't going to get bogged down in those details. As P&G CMO Marc Pritchard said to agencies earlier this year, "Frankly, your complexity should not be our problem, so we want you to make that complexity invisible." Ultimately that's going to apply to tech vendors as well. Hook agrees. "Tech is a component, it's a tool that you use to get the answer. … How do you create the machine that's super elegant, you hit the button and the answer comes out?" When it comes to marketing tech, she says, "Boring is good. Boring delivers." The goal of any successful martech or adtech or information services company, she says, should be to make it all seem easy so that marketers can go back to worrying about campaigns and creativity and strategy. Maybe it's just me, but I find that kind of talk sort of exciting.

John Dickerman, head of the Washington DC office for the CBI, was speaking on a visit to the North East where he met with firms in the region to update them on the trading climate between the UK and the US. He said the famed “special relationship” built on shared history, language and the rule of law was still intact, but that those bonds needed attention in the wake of the UK’s vote to leave the European Union . Tensions surrounding the US presidential election , with both candidates looking to protect American jobs, and the failure to agreed the TTIP trade deal, also showed the fragile nature of trade links between the two countries. Those issues make it more important than ever for North East companies to look for export opportunities in the US, but Mr Dickerman said too many firms targeted places like New York and Los Angeles and ignored the chances to do business in smaller regional centres. He said: “It may seem like a simple market to invest in because of the shared law and language links but in reality it’s 50 different markets. “Make sure you have the right location picked out, make sure you have the right partners in that location and understand that if one week you invest in California, it doesn’t mean that next week you can open an office in New York as well. “Making sure you look at location is very important. The notion of regional centres is as important in the US as it is in the UK. We would have the tendency to call some of these places secondary markets in the US, but they’re not secondary, they’re just smaller than the established markets. Cities like Denver, for example, of Portland Oregon, or Seattle. There are fantastic opportunities and, talking practically, there are huge tax breaks too and it can be much easier to get your goods to market.” In a bulletin to members earlier this year, the CBI highlighted the extensive nature of trade links between Britain and America, pointing out that UK firms were investing in every state while many US firms, such as Procter & Gamble, were major players in regions like the North East. But the bulletin said that “there is so much work to be done to make it easier for British and American businesses to invest in each other’s economies, trade with one another, and move across each other’s borders.” Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Business Newsletter Follow @EveningChron Subscribe to our Business newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On European Union US presidential elections Politics business all Most Read Most Recent Eldon SquareRed's True Barbecue creates 80 jobs at £1.2m Newcastle restaurant The firm is making final preparations for its 165-cover restaurant at intu Eldon Square's Grey's Quarter MetroCentreStationery brand Staples is to disappear after struggling business is sold The chain, which has stores at the Metrocentre and on Teesside, has been bought by restructuring firm that also owns HMV NewburnNewcastle technology firm True Potential makes UK growth list for three years running True Potential and fellow Newcastle firm Performance Horizon are only North East entries on the Deloitte Technology Fast 50 Newcastle City CentreNew four-star Maldron Hotel set to open in Newcastle city centre This will be the first Maldron Hotel to open in the UK, as part of the Newgate Street redevelopment Newcastle City CentreTen-storey Newcastle student scheme to go back before planners Nixon Homes has submitted new plans for a student block on St James' Boulevard in Newcastle city centre CramlingtonTommee Tippee respond to 300 help offers in search of 'little blue cup' The Cramlington firm's social media team are set to reveal how many special cups have been found for autistic Ben Carter Eldon SquareRed's True Barbecue creates 80 jobs at £1.2m Newcastle restaurant The firm is making final preparations for its 165-cover restaurant at intu Eldon Square's Grey's Quarter Newcastle City CentreTen-storey Newcastle student scheme to go back before planners Nixon Homes has submitted new plans for a student block on St James' Boulevard in Newcastle city centre The Co-operativeCo-op extends support to British farming with pledge to double local suppliers The Co-op small business charter has been welcomed by Farming Minister George Eustice and the NFU NewburnNewcastle technology firm True Potential makes UK growth list for three years running True Potential and fellow Newcastle firm Performance Horizon are only North East entries on the Deloitte Technology Fast 50 Most Read Most Recent Newcastle United FCNewcastle United news LIVE: Rafa Benitez's press conference at 1pm - here's everything he said All the latest from the Newcastle United camp as Rafa Benitez gets his troops ready for Elland Road and speaks to the media ahead of it Newbiggin-by-the-seaTeenager 'extremely distressed' after stranger rape in Newbiggin-by-the-Sea The 14-year-old was walking down a back lane when her attacker grabbed her from behind and sexually assaulted her North TynesideTwo new Metro stations could be built to cope with thousands of proposed homes North Tyneside Council's Local Plan includes proposals for new stations to serve Murton Gap and Killingworth Moor NorthumberlandRoad blocked by an overturned lorry which shed its load has reopened The A697, near to Powburn, Northumberland, was closed for nine hours after a lorry overturned on Friday morning BykerByker care home bleach tablet death: inquest is set to take place in New Year Safeguarding meeting to come at Balmoral Court in Newcastle following resident's tragic death in August NorthumberlandRoad blocked by an overturned lorry which shed its load has reopened The A697, near to Powburn, Northumberland, was closed for nine hours after a lorry overturned on Friday morning NHSHospital parking: What rules do North East hospitals have and who can park for free?
