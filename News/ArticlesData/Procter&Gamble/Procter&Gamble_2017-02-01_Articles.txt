Stock? Why investors should take a closer look at P&G stock today. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Feb 1, 2017 at 12:31PM Image source: Getty Images. Halfway through its 2017 fiscal year, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) looks like a business on the mend. Sales growth is running ahead of management's forecast, in contrast to rivals Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) and Unilever (NYSE:UL). Sure, none of these consumer-goods stocks will post big gains if their global industry continues to bounce along at near zero growth. But there are some good reasons for investors to prefer P&G over its peers right now. Growth momentum The stock has underperformed the market over the last one-year and three-year time periods as revenue growth slowed to a crawl. Organic sales ticked up by just 1% in fiscal 2016, a time that coincided with roughly 4% gains for both Unilever and Kimberly-Clark. P&G still produced plenty of cash last year and managed a spike in profits, thanks to aggressive cost cuts. And those wins translated into significant improvements in direct returns to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. However, as the company explains in its 10-K report, its ability to generate solid long-term returns starts with organic sales growth that's higher than the categories and geographies in which it competes. Image source: P&G investor presentation. P&G isn't there yet -- but it's getting closer. Last quarter, organic sales growth was driven by strong volume gains. Better still, its sales pace has now accelerated for three straight quarters in both the U.S. and China, its two largest markets. As a result, executives raised their full-year outlook to 2.5%, or more than double last year's result. Kimberly-Clark, meanwhile, is projecting just 2% growth in 2017, down from the 4% it originally hoped to achieve in 2016. Profits and cash Whether sales growth comes in just above or below that target, it's clear that P&G's profits are headed higher. This metric hasn't been useful for investors to follow lately thanks to the combination of massive foreign currency swings and a brand divestment initiative that's alternatively pinched, and supercharged short-term results. Reported net earnings dove by 40% in 2015 before soaring by 49% last year. PG Net Income (Annual) data by YCharts. That's why shareholders should focus on core earnings, which strip out those one-time effects. P&G aims to improve that figure by around 5% annually, yet has endured a 2% decline in each of the last two fiscal years. Things will be different in 2017. Core earnings rose 5% in its fiscal first quarter and by 4% in the second quarter, which puts it on track to meet, or even slightly exceed, its long-term goal. These gains smooth the way for unusually large cash returns to shareholders over the next few years. P&G plans to deliver a record $22 billion to its investors in 2017. Most of that will come in the form of stock repurchases. But its dividend payout ratio is also improving to the point where income investors should see a stronger raise this year than the 1% uptick they received in 2016. Valuation and outlook The rising fortunes help explain why P&G's stock outperformed both Unilever and Kimberly-Clark over the last year even though all three companies trailed the Dow by a wide margin. Much of that optimism is already factored into the share price, though. P&G is valued at 23 times expected earnings, compared to about 20 times for its peers. The company will earn that premium if it achieves market-beating organic growth at a higher profitability level, as management has promised would result from its shift to a more focused product portfolio. Sluggish market conditions could always push the timing of that rebound out, but for now, it looks like P&G is at least on track to meet its operating and financial goals for the first time in three years.

Financial terms were not disclosed. Michael Angelo’s is the first investment by Sovos Brands, a new type of food and beverage company that seeks to acquire and build one-of-a-kind brands to establish a scale player in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry. Headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area and led by seasoned CPG executives, Sovos Brands will focus on high-quality brands in on-trend categories with the potential to accelerate growth by investing in distribution, marketing, production and product innovation. The company, whose name is inspired by the Latin term sovos, which means unique or one of a kind, has a distinctive approach to people and brands, working to ensure that both can really thrive. Spearheading the acquisition and value creation initiatives at Sovos Brands will be a team headed by Todd Lachman, President and CEO, Larry Bodner, CFO, and Bill Johnson, Chairman. Mr. Lachman has a 25-year record of delivering growth and value creation as a senior executive at major consumer products companies, including Mars, Del Monte Foods, H.J. Heinz and Procter & Gamble.

With their investments in production, distribution and product innovation, we believe we can accelerate Michael Angelo’s growth and continue our mission of creating the highest-quality Italian entrées in the freezer aisle.

Michael Angelo's is the first investment by Sovos Brands, a new type of food and beverage company that seeks to acquire and build one-of-a-kind brands to establish a scale player in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry. Headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area and led by seasoned CPG executives, Sovos Brands will focus on high-quality brands in on-trend categories with the potential to accelerate growth by investing in distribution, marketing, production and product innovation.

MENU All Girls Fantasy Sports Advice Real sports As seen on tv Rankings Everything else Shop Home As seen on tv Current Page Super Bowl Ad Power Rankings: Melissa McCarthy Is The Eco-Warrior We Need Right Now Tweet Rick Chandler 2:51 pm, February 1st, 2017 There’s something in the air, and it smells like … capitalism. We’re only four days from the Super Bowl: aren’t you excited? Our power rankings have bloomed from a top 10 to a top 20, with several new entries to thrill your senses. Check back here every day for more commercials! 1. Mercedes-Benz: “Easy Driver” With films such as Fargo, Raising Arizona and The Big Lebowski, the Coen Brothers are nearly as iconic as Peter Fonda and the 1969 classic Easy Rider. Now the three come together for a Super Bowl commercial. The Coens wrote and directed this one, for Mercedes-Benz, their first since making a Super Bowl ad for H&R Block in 2002. 2. Turbo Tax: “Humpty Fall” TurboTax is back for the fourth consecutive year with a 45-second spot, starring Humpty Dumpty. 3. Budweiser: “Born The Hard Way” . The political ad that isn’t, Anheuser-Busch’s ode to German immigrant founder Adolphus Busch, is actually a one-minute biopic. It cost upwards of $15 million including production costs, and A-B is gambling that it will give faltering Budweiser a shot in the arm. 4. Kia: “Hero’s Journey” The full ad was just released today, showing Melissa McCarthy working hard to save the planet. She is not the eco-warrior we deserve right now, but she’s the one we need. Especially with Trump in charge. 5. Skittles: “Romance” America’s most popular non-chocolate candy checks in with their new ad, and it’s an upgrade from last year’s bizarre Steven Tyler nightmare-inducing effort. “Katy! …” 6. Mr. Clean: “Cleaner Of Your Dreams” Believe it or not, Mr. Clean is coming up on his 60th anniversary next year. Making his debut in 1958, the Procter & Gamble cleaning product was invented by the owner of a shipping line who needed a non-toxic cleaning product that wouldn’t make his workers sick. When it was later released to the general public, Mr. Clean immediately became the top-selling household cleaner on the market. Its mascot, the smiling genie-in-a-cleaning-bottle, has changed little in 59 years — in appearance, anyway. This year Procter & Gamble has introduced a new, sexy Mr. Clean, a detergent gigolo who just may seduce your wife if you’re not vigilant. In its Super Bowl debut, Procter & Gamble gives us the new Mr. Clean. I feel a little dirty. 7. Go Daddy: “The Internet Wants You” How many recent memes did you count in this commercial? I got 20 … among them the Rick Roll sound track. That’s the point of this spot, where the internet approves of what you’re doing (sneezing panda). 8. Wix: “Chef Felix” Jason Statham and Gal Gadot would be better off making this a movie franchise. 9. Buick: “Not So Pee Wee Football” What can Miranda Kerr and Cam Newton do today to get you into this car? 10. Squarespace: “Being John Malcovich.com” The actor can’t believe that someone else has the domain name he wants. Drama ensues in a Burn After Reading kind of way. 11. Ford: “Go Further” The kid hanging by his shoe by the top of a chain-link fence is worth the price of admission here, at least for me, because I witnessed something like that in real life and it was hilarious. 12. Yellow Tail: “Kangaroo” Wait, doesn’t Anheuser-Busch have exclusive rights to alcohol advertising at the Super Bowl? Well, yes. But Yellow Tail got around that by producing this regional ad, which will be seen in 80 percent of the country. 13. Sprint: “Car” Any commercial where a kid looks at his dad and asks “Isn’t that illegal?” will always rate highly here. Sprint continues it’s all-out war on Verizon, because it knows Verizon won’t fight back. 14. Wendy’s: “Cold Storage” Wendy’s is a little sensitive about the notion that their beef comes from frozen patties. Remember this?: @NHride Sorry to hear you think that! But you're wrong, we've only ever used fresh beef since we were founded in 1969. — Wendy's (@Wendys) January 2, 2017 @NHride Where do you store cold things that aren't frozen? — Wendy's (@Wendys) January 2, 2017 @NHride You don't have to bring them into this just because you forgot refrigerators existed for a second there. — Wendy's (@Wendys) January 2, 2017 So now they’re advertising in the Super Bowl for the first time in 40 years, where the world will finally realize that their beef is NOT FROZEN, DAMMIT! 15. Avocados From Mexico: “Secret Society” Jon Lovitz is the best part of this, but he’s only on screen for a moment. In other news, avocados are delicious and don’t really need any hype. 16. Febreze: “Bathroom Break” We get the premise, but how many of your Super Bowl party guests are really going No. 2? If you’re using that much Febreze, I’d look into what you’re serving. 17. Tide: “Gronk’s Cleaners Discount” Tide is implying that there will be a Part II to this commercial when it appears on Sunday. I sure hope so. It will be nice to see Gronk during the game, and Jeffrey Tambor is always awesome. But the spot itself is rather mediocre. 18. LIFEWTR: “Inspiration Drops” 19. Pepsi & Tostitos: “Super Bowl Party Planner” Von Miller is here to save your Super Bowl party. 20. Intel: “Brady Everyday” Intel replay can make anything epic, says this ad. I challenge the call. 21. Busch: “BUSCHHHHH” *** Thanks to AdWeek, USA Today, Super Bowl Commercials, YouTube, Forbes. tags: Super Bowl 51 Super Bowl Ad Power Rankings Tweet More from SportsGrid Super Bowl Ad Power Rankings: The Somewhat Disturbing Return Of Spuds MacKenzie Super Bowl Ad Power Rankings: Anheuser-Busch Jumps In With Powerful Immigrant Statement Super Bowl Ad Power Rankings: Budweiser Spot Is Direct Swipe At Trump’s Muslim Ban And It Looks Like We’ve Got Our First Banned Super Bowl Ad … Because Trump The Coen Brothers Have Directed A Super Bowl Ad For The First Time In 15 Years Courtyard Marriott Released A Way-too-early Super Bowl 51 Ad newsletter Send us A Tip! × Send us A Tip!

Last Updated: 1 February 2017 Article by Paul Ranjard Wan Hui Da - Peksung IP Group Your LinkedIn Connections at Firm In 2014, the Supreme People's Court (SPC) circulated a draft and collected comments, after which the draft was significantly revised. This final version of the Provisions has been adopted at the 1703rd meeting of the Judicial Committee of the SPC on December 12, 2016 and will enter into effect on March 1, 2017. The Provisions brings very useful guidance for the Beijing IP Court (1st instance) and the Beijing High Court (2nd instance), in relation to appeals filed against decisions of the Trademark Review and Adjudication Board (TRAB). The 31 articles of these Provisions address a variety of situations, the main ones being related to "absolute grounds" of refusal, "relative grounds" of refusal, "bad faith" applications, other prior rights (copyright, name right etc.), the "use" of a trademark, and several procedural issues. The Provisions refers to the relevant articles of the Trademark Law (L. --- ) and to its own articles (Provisions --). Absolute grounds Prohibited signs (L.10) Regarding the use of State names (L. 10.1.1), the Provisions recommends to look at the trademark "as a whole". This means that even if a trademark contains the name of a State, if the mark is not, as a whole, similar to such name and if the registration of the mark would not be "detrimental to the national dignity", the mark may be registered (Provisions 3). The interpretation of the term "deceptive signs", in L. 10.1.7, may be made by reference to the same article of the 2001 version of the Trademark Law: "exaggeration and fraud in advertising". (Provisions 4). The expression "having other unhealthy influence" (L.10.1.8) refers to where the filing of a trademark has a "negative or adverse effect on China's public interests", which, for example, may be the result of the filing of the name of a public figure in the political, economic, cultural, religious, ethnic or other field" (Provisions 5). Geographical names (Chinese places above the County level or foreign places known to the public) are, in principle, prohibited under L.10.2. However, they may still be used if the sign, as a whole, has a meaning that allows distinction from the geographical name (Provisions 6). Distinctiveness (L.11) Signs that are the generic name of a product may not be registered as trademarks (L.11.1). However, the sign must be examined "as a whole". If the sign contains a descriptive element, while such element does not affect the distinctiveness of the sign, or if the descriptive sign is presented in a special manner so as to serve as a source identifier, the sign may be registered as a trademark (Provisions 7). In order to determine whether a sign is generic, the Court should verify if it is commonly perceived as such by the relevant public, and may refer to professional reference books, dictionaries etc. �Such perception of the public may also be determined by reference to historical tradition, local customs and practices, geographical environment or other reasons. The Court should also consider the subjective knowledge of the applicant (who knows or should know that its trademark has become generic). Finally, the assessment should be made as of the time of filing of the application. However, if the situation has changed at the time of approval the court may base its decision on the time of registration. Where foreign language is used, it may happen that the foreign words have a descriptive inherent meaning, and should, in principle, be refused for registration as a trademark. However, if the relevant public is hardly aware of the meaning of such word, the mark may still function as a source identifier and be registered. (Provisions 8). Signs that are descriptive may not be registered as trademarks (L.11.2 ). This is the case for signs that merely or mainly describe the features etc. of the goods or services designated by the application. However, if the sign only insinuates the features of the goods... but does not affect its identifying function, the mark may be registered. 3D trademarks (L.12) The registration of such a sign remains very difficult. If, under most circumstances, the relevant public is not likely to take the sign as a source identifier, the mark may not be registered. Furthermore, the fact that the sign has been originally created by or firstly used by the applicant does not necessarily prove that it is distinctive. However, it is possible to rely on acquired distinctiveness through long term or extensive use (Provisions 9). �Relative grounds Unregistered well-known trademark (L.13.2) The owner of an unregistered trademark may oppose or invalidate a litigious trademark by claiming that such trademark is a "duplication, imitation or translation" of its trademark, provided that the owner can prove that (1) its trademark, even though not registered in China, is well-known in China (L.13.2) and (2) that the registration of the litigious trademark is likely to cause confusion. For the determination of the likelihood of confusion, the Provisions enumerates the following factors to be considered by the Courts: �The extent of similarity of the trademarks; The extent of similarity of the goods on which the trademarks are designated to be used; The extent of distinctiveness and reputation of the trademark that requests protection; The degree of attention of the relevant public; and Other pertinent factors. �The Provisions make an additional comment to the above list: the "intention" of the applicant and the evidence of actual confusion may also be taken into consideration, but - and this has been specified by a judge of the SPC during a conference introducing the Provisions � the lack of evidence concerning the intentions of the applicant or any actual confusion will not have any negative impact. This article (Provisions 12) may be compared to the previous Opinions of the SPC, published in 2010 and 2011, where the SPC advised the Courts to take the reputation of both trademarks - the cited trademark and the litigious trademark � when assessing the similarity and the likelihood of confusion. This was called the "inclusive development theory". The theory seems to be abandoned. Registered well-known trademark (L.13.3) The Provisions, then, addresses the situation covered by L. 13.3: the owner of a registered well-known trademark opposes the application, or requests the invalidation, of an identical or similar trademark designating dissimilar goods or services (Provisions 13). Interestingly, however, the Provisions does not use the word dissimilar. It may be implied, though, but as we shall see when examining Provisions 14, this omission might be voluntary. The court is to examine whether the litigious trademark is likely to cause a certain degree of association, so as to mislead the public and harm the interests of the well-known trademark owner. Such examination is to be made by considering the following factors: �The distinctiveness and extent of reputation of the Cited trademark; Whether the trademarks are sufficiently� similar; The goods on which the trademarks are designated to be used; The extent of overlapping of the relevant public and the degree of attention thereof; Signs similar to the Cited trademark that are legitimately used by other market entities or other pertinent factors. �Again, it may be noted that no reference is made to the reputation of the litigious trademark reputation, which confirms the abandonment of the "inclusive development theory". Provisions 25 introduces what appears to be the implementation of a ruling made by the SPC, on May 19, 2016, in the case P&G vs. TRAB and Weishida. In this case, P&G requested the invalidation of the Weishida trademark, more than five years after the registration date. Therefore, pursuant to article 41.2 (now renumbered 45.1) of the Trademark Law, P&G needed to prove that its trademark was well-known at the date of filing of the litigious trademark, and that the litigious trademark has been applied in bad faith. But another difficulty was to be overcome: the protection of a registered well-known trademark, as provided in the law (L.13), only applies to cases where the litigious trademark is used on dissimilar goods. In this case, the goods were identical. Yet, the SPC ruled that article 13 could apply even if the goods are identical. According to Provisions 14, if a party files an opposition of an invalidation action against a litigious trademark, claiming that its trademark is well-known, and the TRAB rules in favour of such claim on the basis of Article L.30� of the law (whereas such article concerns the protection of any trademark, even not well-known, against identical or similar trademarks designating identical or similar goods), the Court may apply Article L.30 if the trademark has been registered for� less than 5 years, or apply Article L.13.3, if the trademark has been registered for more than five years. From this provision, it appears that the SPC agrees that a trademark owner may invoke Article 13.3 (in addition to article L.30) even when the litigious trademark is applied or registered for identical or similar goods. Indeed, if Article L.13.3 can be applied, after the 5 years, to a litigious trademark that would have been refused or invalidated pursuant to Article L.30 (within 5 years), it is obvious that the "dissimilar goods" condition is no longer required for the application of such Article 13.3. Unregistered trademark with a certain influence (L.32) If the opponent or invalidation applicant cannot prove that his trademark is well-known, it is still possible to successfully oppose, or invalidate, a trademark that has been applied or registered "preemptively by unfair means" (L.32). The owner of the cited trademark must prove that the trademark has been used in China and has acquired a certain influence, and must also address the "unfair means" issue.� Here, the Provisions brings some assistance (Provisions 23):� if the applicant of the litigious trademark definitely knew or should have known of the existence of the prior trademark, this may be presumed to constitute pre-emptive registration by unfair means, unless the applicant adduces evidence to prove that he has no bad faith in exploiting the reputation of the prior used trademark". So, provided sufficient of prior use is adduced, the SPC considers that the burden of proof should be reversed onto the litigious trademark applicant. Regarding the evidence proving a certain influence, the Provisions give examples such as continuous use for a certain period of time of a certain geographical coverage.� And, to be perfectly clear, the Provisions adds that article L.32 only applies to trademarks filed on identical or similar goods or services. Other prior rights, copyright, name right etc. (L.32) If the prior right cited under L.32 is another civil right, such right must be valid not only before the date of the litigious trademark application but also at the time of the approval of the trademark (Provisions 18). Provisions 19 to 22 stipulate details explaining how to prove the ownership of copyright and the conditions for obtaining protection of the name, of a pseudonym, of a trade name, of a character image. Bad faith Provisions 15 and 16 provide details concerning the interpretation of L. 15.1 and L.15.2. For example, the terms agent or representative used in L.15.1 should be construed widely as including any kind of intermediary in the sense of sales agency, and should include persons having a kin or any specific relationship with such agent, and even if negotiation have taken place without being concluded. Likewise, the term "other relations" used in L.15.2 covers a wide range of circumstances (family relationship, labour relation, business location in the proximity, un-concluded negotiations). Finally, Provisions 25 deals with another aspect of article L.45.1 which is the "bad faith registration" of the litigious trademark. Here, the SPC introduces two new ideas. First, the Court should examine, not only, the intentions of the litigious trademark applicant (at the time of filing), but also, the status of use of the litigious trademark, which implies to consider facts that occurred after the date of filing. This is also the application of the abovementioned ruling on P&G vs. TRAB and Weishida. And secondly, where the reputation of the cited trademark is high, the Court may presume that the litigious trademark as filed in bad faith, unless the applicant can prove proper cause for such filing. This is the same reversal of the burden of proof as provided in Provisions 23. Use of a trademark (L.49.2) Provisions 26 clarifies the conditions for the revocation based on 3 year non-use, as stipulated in L.49.2. For example, if the used trademark has only a subtle difference with the registered trademark, this constitutes valid use.� Showing the intent to use through necessary preparation may serve as a "proper reason" for the mark not to be (yet) in use. On the other hand, the mere fact of signing an assignment of license agreement, in the absence of actual use, is insufficient. Procedural issues Finally, the Provisions contain a few articles (Provisions 2 and Provisions 27 to 30) that address procedural technicalities. Provision 2 stipulates that, the court may, ex officio, raise a legal ground that a plaintiff had not raised in the administrative litigation, in order to rectify a decision that appears obviously inappropriate. Provision 28 clarifies a situation that occurs very frequently: (i) a trademark is refused on account of a prior right, (ii) the applicant files a review with the TRAB and at the same time a procedure against such prior right, but the procedure is still pending when the TRAB makes its ruling (which confirms the refusal). Then, the case is referred to the Court. The Provisions stipulate that, if the prior right obstacle has been removed ("new facts"), the Court may order the TRAB to re-make its decision (even though such decision was correct at the time).

Georgia native Mike Jackson will represent the Proctor & Gamble all-purpose cleaner, replacing the original Mr. Clean who debuted as the brand ambassador nearly 60 years ago. They have all the same characteristics of a bald head, muscular physique and gold earring. There's just one difference: Jackson is African-American. “It’s definitely a dream come true to become the next Mr. Clean. While it’s impossible to replace the iconic Mr., I’m excited for this opportunity to help people tackle the most seemingly impossible messes while he’s away... and have some fun!” Jackson said in a news release. The new face was chosen after P&G reviewed hundreds of audition tapes after announcing casting calls in Los Angeles and New York for #TheNextMrClean, a contest that started in September 2016. Jackson saw an ad for the competition on Instagram and quickly applied, he told Yahoo! Beauty. Related Stories Google Honors African American Sculptor Edmonia Lewis Black History Month Begins “I googled it to make sure my eyes weren’t deceiving me, and then I just sent in a video,” Jackson said, adding that he has always used the product. “I just felt I embodied who Mr. Clean is.” Aside from winning a $20,000 prize and starring in a limited edition 2017 Mr. Clean calendar, Jackson will make his debut alongside Denver Broncos outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware as the new Mr. Clean during the Super Bowl in Houston Feb. 5. While P&G is expected to feature a new ad during the bowl that includes a tagline “This Super Bowl Mr. Clean gets dirty,” Jackson will not be in the commercial. “Mr. Clean has been tough on grease and grime for 60 years and we’re confident that Mike has what it takes. We had so many great entries in #TheNextMrClean contest and we are very thankful for everyone’s enthusiasm and participation,” P&G’s Associate Brand Director Kevin Wenzel said.

La Monica   @lamonicabuzz February 1, 2017: 10:39 AM ET The original iPhone almost looked like this Apple continues to mint money. The maker of iEverything had $246.1 billion in cash and investments on its balance sheet as of the end of its most recent quarter, up nearly $10 billion from the end of September. That's a new record for non-financial companies. (Banks tend to have a lot more cash than most other companies for operational purposes.) To put this into context, if Apple's cash were a separate company, it would be the 13th most valuable in the S&P 500. Apple is the most valuable, of course. The remaining eleven are Google-parent Alphabet, Microsoft, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, Amazon, Facebook, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, GE and AT&T. Apple's cash pile is bigger than the market values of Procter & Gamble (PG), Bank of America (BAC), Chevron (CVX) and Walmart (WMT). And if President Trump and congressional leaders get their way, Apple (AAPL, Tech30) and other cash hoarders may soon be able to put this money to work in the United States instead of having it sitting in foreign bank accounts collecting interest -- not to mention dust. Apple CFO Luca Maestri said during the company's conference call with analysts on Tuesday that $230.2 billion of its cash -- 94% of it -- was being held overseas. President Trump has called for a one-time tax cut to bring back -- or repatriate -- the cash that big businesses have in foreign accounts. Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30), Alphabet (GOOGL, Tech30), Cisco (CSCO, Tech30) and Oracle (ORCL, Tech30) also have a significant chunk of their cash overseas. Trump is hoping that Apple and these other tech giants could use this cash to hire more American workers. Skeptics claim that companies will be more likely to boost dividends, buy back more stock and maybe acquire companies. That could be good for investors, but not for average Americans who have little (if any) exposure to the stock market. Related: Apple considering legal action over Trump's travel ban Apple CEO Tim Cook said during the conference call that he was "optimistic" that there will be "some sort of tax reform this year," adding that there are "people in both parties that would favor repatriation as a part of that." Cook hinted Apple might use the money on deals. In response to a question from Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty about uses for its cash, he said tax reform would be "very good for the country and good for Apple" and added that "we are always looking at acquisitions." So what could Apple buy with all of its cash? If it wanted (and I'm not suggesting at all that it will...this list is meant for the purposes of fun only) Apple could make a bigger move into media. It could buy Disney or NBCUniversal/DreamWorks Animation parent Comcast -- and have more than $65 billion left for a proverbial rainy day. Or Apple could scoop up Fox, CBS, Viacom and CNN owner Time Warner too. And it would still have about $70 billion more in its bank account. Related: Apple ends earnings losing streak with solid quarter Of course, there are obvious antitrust issues with this fanciful scenario, not to mention the fact that Time Warner already has agreed to sell itself to AT&T. But Apple could go another (admittedly monopolistic) route in the world of media. Salesforce chief digital evangelist Vala Afshar crunched the numbers and tweeted that Apple could buy EVERY team in all four professional U.S sports leagues. Apple has $246 billion in cash. It could buy all:@NFL teams🏈@NBA teams🏀@MLB teams⚾️@NHL teams🏒 ... and still have $94 billion left.— Vala Afshar (@ValaAfshar) January 31, 2017 I wonder if this includes the new expansion NHL team in Sin City though? The Vegas Golden Knights won't hit the ice until the new hockey season starts in the fall of 2017. Another Twitter user looked at economic statistics and found that Apple would be a pretty large country if it were to become its own iNation. Wow - Apple's $246B cash hoard is more than the GDP of Finland ($239B), Chile ($234B), Bangladesh ($226B) and 145 other countries.— Andy Leaver (@AndyLeaver) February 1, 2017 An iPhone in every house and a future Apple Car (if you believe the rumors) in every garage from President Cook of the United States of Apple? Probably not. It's also worth noting that Apple has been borrowing a lot in the past few years, despite having all that cash overseas. Apple's long-term debt load did fall slightly in the most recent quarter, but still stands at $73.6 billion. Still, investors love the fact that Apple's sales and earnings are back on track and that the company is increasing its cash levels too. The stock surged more than 6% Wednesday, helping to boost the overall market. Now we just need to see what Cook will do with all that Apple dough -- and how President Trump will respond to those plans.

The idea of scaling back the tax benefits for the more than 155 million people who get their coverage at work is generating so much concern that it has united those groups in staunch opposition.  In their conversations about repealing and replacing the 2010 health care law, House Republicans are increasingly targeting a longstanding policy that makes employers’ contributions to their workers’ health insurance premiums exempt from federal income and payroll taxes. Republicans, led by Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady of Texas, say capping that tax break would make the code more fair — and, perhaps more importantly, would generate trillions in revenue over several years that could be tapped to pay for other changes to the health care system. “Unlocking the tax credit that belongs to people that’s only available at work, so that it can be used outside of work, obviously I think is a very strong idea. It’s a way in my view to provide that financing  . . .  [for] that monthly affordable credit that really lies at the heart of our backpack,” Brady told CQ Roll Call Tuesday. “Our goal is to unlock a small portion of the tax break individuals get.” The topic also featured prominently in Brady’s remarks to the entire Republican conference last week in a closed-door session. The Washington Post first posted the leaked audio recording of the discussion. Several lobbyists suggested capping the employer tax exclusion is being considered as a policy change in the Senate Finance Committee, though many said the effort is promoted most by Ways and Means members. The lobbyists and other sources said there’s little consensus on exactly how to cap the tax break for job-related insurance or whether to include it on the first or second reconciliation measure expected this year. Finance Committee aides didn’t comment. Groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Alliance to Fight the 40 coalition, the AFL-CIO, the National Retail Federation and the ERISA Industry Council say the policy would destabilize the otherwise relatively healthy employer market.   That coalition is an especially powerful one. Many of the same groups successfully lobbied to delay implementation of the so-called Cadillac tax on expensive health plans, convincing broad bipartisan majorities of both chambers to oppose the policy. They see the proposed cap on the tax break for employer-sponsored health insurance as similar. The Alliance to Fight the 40, an advocacy group with major members like ExxonMobil Corp., Procter and Gamble Co. and Cigna Corp., is even planning to rebrand under a new name for a campaign that will focus more broadly on both the Cadillac tax and the employer tax break, lobbyists and others outside of the group said. The group’s meetings with lawmakers and staff have already included discussions about the job-provided tax break, representatives of member organizations confirmed. “The audio recording made clear the disturbing fact that Congress is considering taxing health benefits provided by employers, meaning higher income taxes for millions,” The Alliance to Fight the 40 said in a statement to CQ Tuesday. “The employer-sponsored health care system is efficient and effective in covering over 177 million Americans. Congress should protect the health care of working families.” If they move forward, Brady and his colleagues will have to convince reluctant lawmakers as well as those groups. Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who sits on both committees with jurisdiction over health care issues in the upper chamber, is vocally opposed to a cap. He says it would be better to pay for any health care law replacement with the same industry taxes that paid for the law. “Pharma’s done very well for the last eight years. They’re going to get their taxes repealed, but the middle class is going to suddenly pay more? I’m not sure I see the benefit there,” he said Monday, referring to the drug industry. “It’s going to be placed on the back of the middle class that hasn’t done very well for the last eight years?” Cassidy’s not alone. At an April hearing at Ways and Means, GOP Reps. Dave Reichert of Washington, Jim Renacci of Ohio and Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania, among others, voiced concerns about upending the exclusion. Pros and cons The tax exclusion is the largest subsidy provided through the tax code. The federal government foregoes more than $250 billion a year because nearly all premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance are excluded from federal income and payroll taxes, according to the Congressional Budget Office.  Economists and others say capping the exclusion would reduce waste in the health care system by encouraging employers to adopt less generous plans that give patients more incentive to monitor their own health spending. Economists argue a cap also would distribute tax benefits more evenly and avoid singling out people with jobs for a tax break. House Republicans say their specific plan — which is laid out in some detail in the plan endorsed by Speaker Paul D. Ryan, R-Wis., known as A Better Way — would cap the exclusion so that it limited “only the most generous plans.” They believe employers would rewrite their health plans to avoid hitting the cap, shifting that money toward higher take-home pay. Their proposal, however, doesn’t spell out the specifics of when the cap would be triggered. Republicans also argue that their proposal is less of a “punishment” than the health care law’s so-called Cadillac tax that was designed to impose a 40 percent tax on especially high-cost health plans. Congress delayed its implementation. CBO has suggested, however, that capping the subsidy would reduce the number of people with employer-sponsored insurance and increase the financial burden for Americans with high medical costs. Opponents, too, argue that the cap would destabilize the employer insurance market at a time when it is one of the most stable. “It would be a cruel hoax on the American public if replacement for the Affordable Care Act is a measure that now taxes their health benefits,” said Jim Klein, president of the American Benefits Council, a member of the Alliance in an interview. “The individual marketplace is so fragile. We need to stabilize the individual marketplace and not destabilize the employer-sponsored system that covers more than half of all Americans.” The U.S. Chamber of Commerce joined the American Benefits Council and a host of other groups, including the National Retail Federation and the National Business Group on Health, on a Dec. 15 letter to Congress on the issue.  “We support efforts aimed at controlling health care costs, but taxing an employer’s deduction or capping an employee’s exclusion will not accomplish that objective. On the contrary, both measures will raise costs for employers and employees,” the groups wrote. The issue has been at the center of the AFL-CIO’s lobbying, too, said Tom Liebfried, a health care lobbyist for the group. He pushed back on the idea that the plan could be limited to only high-income individuals. “This idea that you can just hit people at the top — If you really need to pay for something, it very quickly gets into what everybody considers ‘middle class,’” he said.

The Apple headquarters at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California. The Apple headquarters at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California. The Apple headquarters at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California. Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple and serves on its Board of Directors. Before being named CEO in August 2011, Tim was Apple's Chief Operating Officer and was responsible for all of the company's worldwide sales and operations. By Paul R. La Monica NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Apple continues to mint money. The maker of iEverything had $246.1 billion in cash and investments on its balance sheet as of the end of its most recent quarter, up nearly $10 billion from the end of September. That's a new record for non-financial companies. (Banks tend to have a lot more cash than most other companies for operational purposes.) To put this into context, if Apple's cash were a separate company, it would be the 13th most valuable in the S&P 500. Apple is the most valuable, of course. The remaining dozen are Google-parent Alphabet, Microsoft, Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway, Amazon, Facebook, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, GE and AT&T. Apple's cash pile is bigger than the market values of Procter & Gamble, Bank of America, Chevron and Walmart. And if President Trump and congressional leaders get their way, Apple and other cash hoarders may soon be able to put this money to work in the United States instead of having it sitting in foreign bank accounts collecting interest -- not to mention dust. Apple CFO Luca Maestri said during the company's conference call with analysts on Tuesday that $230.2 billion of its cash -- 94% of it -- was being held overseas. President Trump has called for a one-time tax cut to bring back -- or repatriate -- the cash that big businesses have in foreign accounts. Microsoft, Alphabet, Cisco and Oracle also have a significant chunk of their cash overseas. Trump is hoping that Apple and these other tech giants could use this cash to hire more American workers. Skeptics claim that companies will be more likely to boost dividends, buy back more stock and maybe acquire companies. That could be good for investors, but not for average Americans who have little (if any) exposure to the stock market. Apple CEO Tim Cook said during the conference call that he was "optimistic" that there will be "some sort of tax reform this year," adding that there are "people in both parties that would favor repatriation as a part of that." Cook hinted Apple might use the money on deals. In response to a question from Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty about uses for its cash, he said tax reform would be "very good for the country and good for Apple" and added that "we are always looking at acquisitions." So what could Apple buy with all of its cash? If it wanted (and I'm not suggesting at all that it will...this list is meant for the purposes of fun only) Apple could make a bigger move into media. It could buy Disney or NBCUniversal/DreamWorks Animation parent Comcast -- and have more than $65 billion left for a proverbial rainy day. Or Apple could scoop up Fox, CBS, Viacom and CNN owner Time Warner too. And it would still have about $70 billion more in its bank account. Of course, there are obvious antitrust issues with this fanciful scenario, not to mention the fact that Time Warner already has agreed to sell itself to AT&T. But Apple could go another (admittedly monopolistic) route in the world of media. Salesforce chief digital evangelist Vala Ashfar crunched the numbers and tweeted that Apple could buy EVERY team in all four professional U.S sports leagues. I wonder if this includes the new expansion NHL team in Sin City though? The Vegas Golden Knights won't hit the ice until the new hockey season starts in the fall of 2017. Another Twitter user looked at economic statistics and found that Apple would be a pretty large country if it were to become its own iNation. An iPhone in every house and a future Apple Car (if you believe the rumors) from President Cook of the United States of Apple? Probably not. It's also worth noting that Apple has been borrowing a lot in the past few years, despite having all that cash overseas. Apple's long-term debt load did fall slightly in the most recent quarter, but still stands at $73.6 billion. Still, investors love the fact that Apple's sales and earnings are back on track and that the company is increasing its cash levels too. The stock surged more than 5% Wednesday, helping to boost the overall market. Now we just need to see what Cook will do with all that Apple dough -- and how President Trump will respond to those plans. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

It could buy all:@NFL teams🏈@NBA teams🏀@MLB teams⚾️@NHL teams🏒 ... and still have $94 billion left.— Vala Afshar (@ValaAfshar) January 31, 2017 I wonder if this includes the new expansion NHL team in Sin City though? The Vegas Golden Knights won't hit the ice until the new hockey season starts in the fall of 2017. Another Twitter user looked at economic statistics and found that Apple would be a pretty large country if it were to become its own iNation. Wow - Apple's $246B cash hoard is more than the GDP of Finland ($239B), Chile ($234B), Bangladesh ($226B) and 145 other countries.— Andy Leaver (@AndyLeaver) February 1, 2017 An iPhone in every house and a future Apple Car (if you believe the rumors) in every garage from President Cook of the United States of Apple? Probably not. It's also worth noting that Apple has been borrowing a lot in the past few years, despite having all that cash overseas. Apple's long-term debt load did fall slightly in the most recent quarter, but still stands at $73.6 billion. Still, investors love the fact that Apple's sales and earnings are back on track and that the company is increasing its cash levels too. The stock surged more than 6% Wednesday, helping to boost the overall market. Now we just need to see what Cook will do with all that Apple dough -- and how President Trump will respond to those plans.

The maker of iEverything had $246.1 billion in cash and investments on its balance sheet as of the end of its most recent quarter, up nearly $10 billion from the end of September. That’s a new record for non-financial companies. (Banks tend to have a lot more cash than most other companies for operational purposes.) To put this into context, if Apple’s cash were a separate company, it would be the 13th most valuable in the S&P 500. Apple is the most valuable, of course. The remaining dozen are Google-parent Alphabet, Microsoft, Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway, Amazon, Facebook, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, GE and AT&T. Apple’s cash pile is bigger than the market values of Procter & Gamble, Bank of America, Chevron and Walmart. And if President Trump and congressional leaders get their way, Apple and other cash hoarders may soon be able to put this money to work in the United States instead of having it sitting in foreign bank accounts collecting interest — not to mention dust. Apple CFO Luca Maestri said during the company’s conference call with analysts on Tuesday that $230.2 billion of its cash — 94% of it — was being held overseas. President Trump has called for a one-time tax cut to bring back — or repatriate — the cash that big businesses have in foreign accounts. Microsoft, Alphabet, Cisco and Oracle also have a significant chunk of their cash overseas. Trump is hoping that Apple and these other tech giants could use this cash to hire more American workers. Skeptics claim that companies will be more likely to boost dividends, buy back more stock and maybe acquire companies. That could be good for investors, but not for average Americans who have little (if any) exposure to the stock market. Apple CEO Tim Cook said during the conference call that he was “optimistic” that there will be “some sort of tax reform this year,” adding that there are “people in both parties that would favor repatriation as a part of that.” Cook hinted Apple might use the money on deals. In response to a question from Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty about uses for its cash, he said tax reform would be “very good for the country and good for Apple” and added that “we are always looking at acquisitions.” So what could Apple buy with all of its cash? If it wanted (and I’m not suggesting at all that it will…this list is meant for the purposes of fun only) Apple could make a bigger move into media. It could buy Disney or NBCUniversal/DreamWorks Animation parent Comcast — and have more than $65 billion left for a proverbial rainy day. Or Apple could scoop up Fox, CBS, Viacom and CNN owner Time Warner too. And it would still have about $70 billion more in its bank account. Of course, there are obvious antitrust issues with this fanciful scenario, not to mention the fact that Time Warner already has agreed to sell itself to AT&T. But Apple could go another (admittedly monopolistic) route in the world of media. Salesforce chief digital evangelist Vala Ashfar crunched the numbers and tweeted that Apple could buy EVERY team in all four professional U.S sports leagues. I wonder if this includes the new expansion NHL team in Sin City though? The Vegas Golden Knights won’t hit the ice until the new hockey season starts in the fall of 2017.

MENU All Girls Fantasy Sports Advice Real sports As seen on tv Rankings Everything else Shop Home Animals Current Page Super Bowl Ad Power Rankings: Budweiser Spot Is Direct Swipe At Trump’s Muslim Ban Tweet Rick Chandler 6:57 pm, January 31st, 2017 We rank the Super Bowl commercials as they come out: if they’re any good, that is. Check back every day until the Big Game to see the latest ones. 1. Budweiser: “Born The Hard Way” . Anheuser-Busch says that its feature Super Bowl commercial for Budweiser is in no way political: even though it’s about an immigrant who comes to this country following a dream, and is shunned by the first people he encounters in New Orleans. And releasing it amidst the maelstrom of Trump’s Muslim travel ban is pretty suspicious for a company which says it has nothing to do with politics. But understand that A-B has to frame it that way. Fox, which is broadcasting the game, is banning ads that have anything to do with politics. One company, 84 Lumber, had its ad rejected because it referred to building a wall. With A-B spending an estimated $15 million on the one-minute spot above, they have to defend it. Let’s be serious: A-B is taking advantage of the headlines in a big way, and Fox won’t ban it because Budweiser is too big. So here we go. The ad tells the story of Adolphus Busch, who immigrated to the U.S. from Germany in 1857 and began a brewing empire in St. Louis. A-B is gambling a lot on this ad. Budweiser revenues over the third quarter are down by mid-single digits, according to AdWeek, and its market share is down 20 percent. And per Budweiser’s own numbers, 44 percent of all Americans between the ages of 21 and 27 have never even tried a Budweiser. The smart money right now is on craft beer, which as of 2013 was for the first time shipping more barrels than Budweiser. So InBev Anheuser-Busch, which owns Bud, is now tasked with rejuvenating the brand. But can one commercial campaign change a company’s fortunes that dramatically? Advertising in the Super Bowl always helps. The 2014 Budweiser spot Puppy Love is the most-watched Super Bowl commercial of all time on YouTube, and the Clydesdales are the most recognized brand image. Bud is spending a fortune on Born the Hard Way — an estimated $2 million in production costs, $5 million per 30 seconds, and an undisclosed amount for the exclusive alcohol advertising rights at the Super Bowl. That’s upward of $15 million, most likely, for the one-minute commercial. 2. Mercedes-Benz: “Easy Driver” With films such as Fargo, Raising Arizona and The Big Lebowski, the Coen Brothers are nearly as iconic as Peter Fonda and the 1969 classic Easy Rider. Now the three come together for a Super Bowl commercial. The Coens wrote and directed this one, for Mercedes-Benz, their first since making a Super Bowl ad for H&R Block in 2002. AdWeek: “Peter Fonda plays a critical piece of the storyline, and he’s known as someone who still epitomizes what it is to love driving performance and the open road,” said Drew Slaven, vice president of marketing for Mercedes-Benz USA. “… The film [Easy Rider] component goes back 48 years. We thought there was a nice parallel that was set up between the era of that and what was, in 1967, the beginnings of AMG.” 3. Turbo Tax: “Humpty Fall” TurboTax is back for the fourth consecutive year with a 45-second spot, starring Humpty Dumpty. 4. Skittles: “Romance” The candy checks in with their new ad, and it’s an upgrade from last year’s bizarre Steven Tyler nightmare-inducer. “Katy! …” 5. Mr. Clean: “Cleaner Of Your Dreams” Believe it or not, Mr. Clean is coming up on his 60th anniversary next year. Making his debut in 1958, the Procter & Gamble cleaning product was invented by the owner of a shipping line who needed a non-toxic cleaning product that wouldn’t make his workers sick. When it was later released to the general public, Mr. Clean immediately became the top-selling household cleaner on the market. Its mascot, the smiling genie-in-a-cleaning-bottle, has changed little in 59 years — in appearance, anyway. This year Procter & Gamble has introduced a new, sexy Mr. Clean, a detergent gigolo who just may seduce your wife if you’re not vigilant. In its Super Bowl debut, Procter & Gamble gives us the new Mr. Clean. I feel a little dirty. 6. Ford: “Go Further” The kid hanging by his shoe by the top of a chain-link fence is worth the price of admission here, at least for me, because I witnessed something like that in real life and it was hilarious. 7. Squarespace: “John Malcovich” The actor can’t believe that someone else has the domain name he wants. Drama ensues in a Burn After Reading kind of way. 8. Tide: “Gronk’s Cleaners Discount” Tide is implying that there will be a Part II to this commercial when it appears on Sunday. I sure hope so. It will be nice to see Gronk during the game, and Jeffrey Tambor is always awesome. But the spot itself is rather mediocre. 9. Wendy’s: “Cold Storage” Wendy’s is a little sensitive about the notion that their beef comes from frozen patties. Remember this?: @NHride Sorry to hear you think that! But you're wrong, we've only ever used fresh beef since we were founded in 1969. — Wendy's (@Wendys) January 2, 2017 @NHride Where do you store cold things that aren't frozen? — Wendy's (@Wendys) January 2, 2017 @NHride You don't have to bring them into this just because you forgot refrigerators existed for a second there. — Wendy's (@Wendys) January 2, 2017 So now they’re advertising in the Super Bowl for the first time in 40 years, where the world will finally realize that their beef is NOT FROZEN, DAMMIT! 10. Yellow Tail: “Kangaroo” Wait, doesn’t Anheuser-Busch have exclusive rights to alcohol advertising at the Super Bowl? Well, yes. But Yellow Tail got around that by producing this regional ad, which will be seen in 80 percent of the country. *** Thanks to AdWeek, AdAge, USA Today, Super Bowl Ads, Forbes. tags: Super Bowl 51 Super Bowl Ads Tweet More from SportsGrid And It Looks Like We’ve Got Our First Banned Super Bowl Ad … Because Trump Super Bowl Ad Power Rankings: The Somewhat Disturbing Return Of Spuds MacKenzie Super Bowl Ad Power Rankings: Anheuser-Busch Jumps In With Powerful Immigrant Statement Super Bowl Ad Power Rankings: Melissa McCarthy Is The Eco-Warrior We Need Right Now The Coen Brothers Have Directed A Super Bowl Ad For The First Time In 15 Years Courtyard Marriott Released A Way-too-early Super Bowl 51 Ad newsletter Send us A Tip! × Send us A Tip!

The Super Bowl is appointment viewing each year for football fans, pitting the final two teams standing against each other to determine that season's NFL champion. But for non-football fans, the Super Bowl is also a must-watch experience, if for nothing else than the ads throughout the game. How do you know that everyone will be watching? Just look at what advertisers are willing to pay to get their 30-second spot in front of a Super Bowl audience: Buying a 30-second spot will cost over $5 million on average, according to Variety. While some advertisers wait to make their big reveal during the game and others come up with a unique plan on how to make every penny spent count (more on that in a minute), others make their ads available to watch before kickoff. Below is more on what you can expect to see on Super Bowl Sunday, as well as the best and worst Super Bowl commercials of all-time. Commercials for Super Bowl LI Snickers This isn't the actual Snickers ad, but there's a very good reason for that: the company will be shooting their commercial, which features "Star Wars" star Adam Driver, live. Here's their teaser for the spot: Advertising Age reports that it's the first time a commercial will be shown live during the Super Bowl since 1981, when Schiltz ran a live taste test during Super Bowl XV. Intel The tech company enlisted Patriots quarterback Tom Brady for their commercial: Intel also managed a little bit of luck, as they debuted their commercial well before Brady and his team earned their spot in the big game. Buffalo Wild Wings B-Dubs is teaming up with Packers great Brett Favre on a series of spots leading up to their commercial during Super Bowl LI. Here's the first: You can follow the man himself on Twitter to keep up with the campaign. Squarespace The website builder/domain hosting company follows John Malkovich's quest to sign up for a URL: Squarespace's Super Bowl spots have previously featured Jeff Bridges, Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele. Lexus The car manufacturer is going with a dance-themed ad to promote the 2018 LC 500 performance coupe. Here's an extended version of the spot: If the performer looks familiar, it's because Lil' Buck is also in the Apple AirPods commercial that debuted this January. Skittles The candy company may wind up with the biggest buzz of all Super Bowl commercials by the time the game is over. Here's a look: It's already appeared on YouTube's list of trending videos and had amassed more than 500,000 by Wednesday afternoon after going live the previous day. GoDaddy After years of being known for their risque ads, the Internet service provider has gone lighter in recent years. They appear to be continuing in that vein with this year's spot. Here are several teasers for their Super Bowl ad: The actual Super Bowl ad will turn "The Internet" into a person. Don't anticipate a famous celebrity playing the role, per Advertising Age. TurboTax The tax preparation company dropped their first teaser during Sunday's AFC Championship Game, featuring none other than Humpty Dumpty: Two additional teasers are scheduled leading up to the company's 45-second Super Bowl spot, per Advertising Age. Wix.com The website builder's ad answers a very important question: What happens when Wonder Woman meets The Transporter? The ad above debuted on YouTube Live and Facebook Live amassed more than 2 million views on YouTube in the eight days since its release. Kia The auto company will be advertising its 2017 Kia Niro during the game, but they dropped a 15-second teaser this week: Melissa McCarthy, star of the long-running CBS sitcom "Mike & Molly," features in the spot. Mr. Clean The official cleaner of Super Bowl LI, Mr. Clean released their official Super Bowl commercial on YouTube: It's Procter & Gamble's first Super Bowl ad ever for the iconic character, USA Today reports. Avocados from Mexico The avocado awareness organization features Jon Lovitz in their hypnotic teaser for this year's offering: The organization earned plenty of buzz for its first Super Bowl ad in 2015 featuring the "First Draft Ever." Mercedes-Benz The car company debuted a 1-minute version of their Coen Brothers-directed Super Bowl ad on YouTube on Friday: Peter Fonda stars in the ad for the Mercedes-AMG GT Roadster. Top five Super Bowl ads ever 5. Volkswagen (2011) Of all the more recent ad spots, this one sticks out: Can you get any more adorable than a mini-Darth Vader trying to use The Force? 4. Budweiser (1989) The first Bud Bowl was held during Super Bowl XXIII: The spot would have seven sequels throughout the '90s in arguably the most memorable long-running ad campaign in Super Bowl history. 3. Apple (1984) While not as sports-centric as most of the top ads on this list, there's no denying the debut of the Apple Macintosh its spot: The Super Bowl spot was the only time Apple ran this ad, which is arguably among the top commercials of all time. 2. McDonald's (1993) The fast-food company landed a pair of iconic NBA stars to battle over their burgers and fries: I'd watch these two go at it in a head-to-head shooting contest today. Get on it, McDonald's. 1. Coca-Cola (1980) Could it be anything else? Often imitated but never duplicated, Mean Joe Greene's Coke commercial launched 37 years of must-see Super Bowl commercial viewing. Worst Super Bowl ad ever Fortune.com has a great list of terrible Super Bowl ads worth checking out. While many didn't work due to insensitive takes on race, death and other topics and deserve consideration, one was proud to declare itself the worst commercial ever. Despite having no reason to offend, Lifeminders.com is just that: Unsurprisingly, the website didn't stick around for the long haul.

Dallas, TX – January 31, 2017 – Dr. Hank Seitz, personal and professional development consultant, has joined the legendary Best-Selling Author® and success expert Brian Tracy and a select group of ThoughtLeaders® from around the world to co-write the book, The Success Blueprint. This title aims to provide the reader with strategies to find success in their health, wealth, and lifestyle, and also features content from JW Dicks, Esq. and Nick Nanton, Esq., international Best-Selling Authors® and marketing experts. The book was published by CelebrityPress® and was released on December 22, 2016. On the day of release, The Success Blueprint reached best-seller status in two Amazon.com categories – reaching as high as #6 in the category “Direct Marketing”. The publication also reached a ranking of #57 in the “Sales and Selling” category. Dr. Hank Seitz contributed a chapter titled “The Power of Emotion!” which discusses affirmative thinking and it’s influence on your future success. CelebrityPress® describes the book: A BLUEPRINT for SUCCESS is the architectural rendition of what success should look like. It will give you the detail and various views of the concept. It is no secret that achieving goals is a personal and individual pursuit. Your goals are invariably different to those of your neighbor. One important secret in pursuing your goal is in your ability to identify it clearly and distinctly. Accomplishing any goal for success requires us to make changes to the identified product/service/present condition or situation, in order to produce what we are trying to achieve. While difficult to define success succinctly, we have been given many pointers along the way. Successful and well-known people have always given us food for thought. A few examples are: “Don’t let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.” John R. Wooden “A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” Lao Tzu “What the mind can conceive, it can achieve.” Napoleon Hill “If opportunity doesn’t knock, build a door.” Milton Berle The CelebrityExperts® in this book have dedicated themselves to their goals. Their blueprints include the good, the bad and the ugly. They are not afraid of success or failure. Their experiences will guide and mentor you as you pursue your own goals and begin designing your own SUCCESS BLUEPRINT. After such a successful release, Dr. Hank Seitz will be recognized by The National Academy of Best-Selling Authors™, an organization that honors authors from many of the leading independent best-seller lists. Click HERE to order a copy of The Success Blueprint. A portion of the royalties earned from The Success Blueprint will be given to Entrepreneur’s International Foundation, a not for profit organization dedicated to creating awareness for charitable causes.

This training is designed to ignite innovation within the people, projects, and cultures of businesses and organizations. Anyone who wants to learn how to create, pitch, test and implement new ideas for products, services, customers and markets, processes, business models, and systems – faster and smarter – should attend. The Innovation Engineering Quick Start course will be held February 27 through March 1, 2017 at GlobalFoundries in Essex Junction. The course will be taught by well-known international innovation expert and entrepreneur, Doug Hall, Founder and CEO of Eureka!Ranch in Cincinnati, Ohio. Innovation Engineering Quick Start not only teaches the fundamentals of innovation, but during the program attendees begin applying this learning to their current work – working smarter and achieving immediate impacts. The course is based on 12 core skills that make up Innovation Engineering, a relatively new field of leadership science and academic study. With these skills, attendees will be able to write an innovation project mission that will inspire great ideas, create 8 times more big ideas than brainstorming, increase the persuasive power of your ideas by up to 5 times, make decisions to keep or kill ideas more quickly, amplify benefits of your current development system, and improve alignment on innovation and growth strategies. With additional assignments, there is also an option to earn CEU’s and Innovation Engineering Blue Belt Certification. Innovation Engineering is about applying the discipline of engineering and systems thinking to innovation. The Innovation Engineering body of work has a breadth and depth that is so ‘meaningfully unique,’ it is being taught on or off-campus by more than 20 Universities, being offered as an Undergraduate Minor, a Graduate Certificate, and as an Executive Education program. VMEC is one of the early Innovation Engineering “pioneers,” and since 2006 has introduced and supported the use of this proven scientific method in a variety of Vermont companies and organizations, helping them to ignite innovation and more profitable growth. According to Patricia Giavara, VMEC Assistant Director and Innovation Engineering Black Belt, “Vermont companies that have applied Innovation Engineering systems have demonstrated noteworthy results, such as doubling the number of successful new products introduced per year, reducing development times by a significant 50-60%, and increasing sales by millions of dollars.” Innovation expert Doug Hall is the Founder and CEO of Eureka!Ranch and the Innovation Engineering Institute. Doug is a highly respected innovation leader who is deeply committed to helping American businesses and organizations succeed in today’s rapidly changing world. For 30+ years, the Eureka! companies through their corporate consulting group have served Fortune 500 clients such as: Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Ford, HP and American Express. Doug is also a best-selling author of more than five books on courage, creativity and innovation, including Jump Start Your Business Brain, named, “One of the 100 best business books of all time” by business book expert Jack Covert.

How a Trade War Could Affect Your Portfolio By John Persinos on February 1, 2017 Just login with your email address to instantly generate a PDF of this content. Privacy Policy Worried about a trade war? Well, here’s at least one bit of encouraging news: Scottish-made haggis may soon come to a table near you. President Trump wants to lift the trade ban on British meat that’s been in effect since the “Mad Cow” epidemic in Britain in 1986 — and haggis makers in Scotland are thrilled. In case you don’t know, the Scottish delicacy of haggis is comprised of sheep offal (heart, liver and lungs) stuffed inside the animal’s intestine. Trump, whose mother was born in Scotland and who operates a golf course there, reportedly promised the Scots that he would lift the meat ban. For other industries, though, the situation is less upbeat. President Trump threatened last Thursday to slap a 20% tax on imports from Mexico to help pay for his promised border wall, an announcement that triggered anxiety on Wall Street, punished U.S. stocks, and caused Mexico’s president to cancel his planned trip to the United States. Trump also has threatened to punish China for supposed trade violations by imposing a 45% tariff on Chinese imports. What’s it all mean for your portfolio? Let’s turn for insights to Jim Pearce, chief investment strategist of Personal Finance and Director of Portfolio Strategy for Investing Daily. The Art of (Trade) War… Jim Pearce accurately predicted that Trump’s first order of business would be to shelve the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Signing the executive order against TPP was easy. But as Jim explains, now comes the tough part: “The difficulty comes from replacing it with something Congress and our Asian trading partners can all agree on, a feat that will require extraordinary tact and diplomatic finesse. Because this will be the first time these nations will negotiate with our new president, they will want to set terms that they can live with for at least the next four years. For that reason, I don’t expect to see the trade pact replaced with a new deal this year. The upshot will be a disruption in trade, with large multinational consumer goods manufacturers and many information technology companies hurt the most. To placate these businesses, many of which currently hold large sums of cash overseas to avoid U.S. taxes, Trump will dangle tax reform as a carrot… If a tech trade war between China and the United States materializes, the Chinese already have a ready stable of Asian vendors to ply its markets with almost all the hardware it needs…” Who wins, who loses? Trump has pressured U.S.-based companies to keep and create jobs in this country and has lambasted via tweets several American businesses that have operations abroad. Some analysts warn that if a trade war erupts, no one wins and you should dump stocks altogether. We wouldn’t go that far. But keep in mind, particularly at risk would be U.S.-based multinationals with extensive operations and revenue sources in China and Mexico. The most serious ramifications would occur in the world’s second-largest economy, China. Topping this list of vulnerable global players are familiar Big Pharma names such as Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), Merck (NYSE: MRK) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ). Probably the worst affected stock would be Chicago-based aerospace/defense giant Boeing (NYSE: BA), the largest manufacturer of aircraft in the world and America’s number one exporter. If Trump slaps China with high tariffs for “unfair” subsidies and trading practices, China would almost certainly retaliate and give its substantial aircraft business to Boeing arch-rival Airbus Group (OTC: EADSY). Of course, other companies would suffer as well — and many of them are blue chip stocks popular in retirement portfolios. Caught in a trade war crossfire would be sales of aircraft jet engines made by General Electric (NYSE: GE); autos made by General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Ford (NYSE: F); iPhones and laptops made by Apple (NSDQ: AAPL); soybeans and corn grown by Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE: ADM); and consumer products made by Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) and Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: CL). Just to name a few. However, Trump intends to offset the pain of trade restrictions by granting global corporations significant tax cuts on cash hoards that are repatriated from overseas. That would be a boon for a few of the aforementioned companies, specifically General Electric, Apple and Pfizer, as well as IBM (NYSE: IBM), Microsoft (NYSE: MSFT) and Intel (NSDQ: INTC). Lower taxes on repatriated cash would especially benefit Silicon Valley, because deep-pocketed technology giants probably would use the proceeds to launch a wave of acquisitions, which in turn would stimulate innovation and job creation. As you can see, sorting out the winners and losers of a trade war isn’t so simple. For now, sit tight and don’t make any impulsive moves based on fear. Our investment strategists are monitoring these fast-moving developments; continue following their advice. We’ll provide guidance as events warrant. In the meantime, who knows? Perhaps haggis will one day show up on the White House menu. Got any questions about how a trade war could affect your investments?

Most Popular Bill Nye the Science Guy will star in Persil's Super Bowl ad, a spokeswoman for Henkel confirmed Wednesday following release of the brand's teaser of the spot. The teaser features "The Professional" from last year's 15-second Persil spot by TBWA, also showing an unnamed "Science Guy" making a ruckus in the background. Mr. Nye seems to be making a tough stain that Persil will be charged with removing. Henkel still hasn't said how long the spot will be or when it will run in the game. Rival Procter & Gamble Co.'s Tide will also be in the game with New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski and Jeffrey Tambor of Amazon Prime's "Transparent," who were in a teaser P&G released Monday. P&G also hasn't said how long its ad will be or when in the game it will run. Persil and Tide are among a record four household cleaning brands in the Super Bowl this year.

White @rjwhite1 13h ago • 7 min read With all the hype surrounding Super Bowl LI between the Patriots and the Falcons, there's another part of the big game that draws Monday morning water cooler buzz. The Super Bowl is appointment viewing each year for football fans, pitting the final two teams standing against each other to determine that season's NFL champion. But for non-football fans, the Super Bowl is also a must-watch experience, if for nothing else than the ads throughout the game. More Super Bowl How to watch it TV schedule Team uniforms National anthem Halftime show How do you know that everyone will be watching? Just look at what advertisers are willing to pay to get their 30-second spot in front of a Super Bowl audience: Buying a 30-second spot will cost over $5 million on average, according to Variety. While some advertisers wait to make their big reveal during the game and others come up with a unique plan on how to make every penny spent count (more on that in a minute), others make their ads available to watch before kickoff. Below is more on what you can expect to see on Super Bowl Sunday, as well as the best and worst Super Bowl commercials of all-time. Commercials for Super Bowl LI Snickers This isn't the actual Snickers ad, but there's a very good reason for that: the company will be shooting their commercial, which features "Star Wars" star Adam Driver, live. Here's their teaser for the spot: Advertising Age reports that it's the first time a commercial will be shown live during the Super Bowl since 1981, when Schiltz ran a live taste test during Super Bowl XV. Intel The tech company enlisted Patriots quarterback Tom Brady for their commercial: Intel also managed a little bit of luck, as they debuted their commercial well before Brady and his team earned their spot in the big game. Buffalo Wild Wings B-Dubs is teaming up with Packers great Brett Favre on a series of spots leading up to their commercial during Super Bowl LI. Here's the first: You can follow the man himself on Twitter to keep up with the campaign. Squarespace The website builder/domain hosting company follows John Malkovich's quest to sign up for a URL: Squarespace's Super Bowl spots have previously featured Jeff Bridges, Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele. Lexus The car manufacturer is going with a dance-themed ad to promote the 2018 LC 500 performance coupe. Here's an extended version of the spot: If the performer looks familiar, it's because Lil' Buck is also in the Apple AirPods commercial that debuted this January. Skittles The candy company may wind up with the biggest buzz of all Super Bowl commercials by the time the game is over. Here's a look: It's already appeared on YouTube's list of trending videos and had amassed more than 500,000 by Wednesday afternoon after going live the previous day. GoDaddy After years of being known for their risque ads, the Internet service provider has gone lighter in recent years. They appear to be continuing in that vein with this year's spot. Here are several teasers for their Super Bowl ad: The actual Super Bowl ad will turn "The Internet" into a person. Don't anticipate a famous celebrity playing the role, per Advertising Age. TurboTax The tax preparation company dropped their first teaser during Sunday's AFC Championship Game, featuring none other than Humpty Dumpty: Two additional teasers are scheduled leading up to the company's 45-second Super Bowl spot, per Advertising Age. Wix.com The website builder's ad answers a very important question: What happens when Wonder Woman meets The Transporter? The ad above debuted on YouTube Live and Facebook Live amassed more than 2 million views on YouTube in the eight days since its release. Kia The auto company will be advertising its 2017 Kia Niro during the game, but they dropped a 15-second teaser this week: Melissa McCarthy, star of the long-running CBS sitcom "Mike & Molly," features in the spot. Mr. Clean The official cleaner of Super Bowl LI, Mr. Clean released their official Super Bowl commercial on YouTube: It's Procter & Gamble's first Super Bowl ad ever for the iconic character, USA Today reports. Avocados from Mexico The avocado awareness organization features Jon Lovitz in their hypnotic teaser for this year's offering: The organization earned plenty of buzz for its first Super Bowl ad in 2015 featuring the "First Draft Ever." Mercedes-Benz The car company debuted a 1-minute version of their Coen Brothers-directed Super Bowl ad on YouTube on Friday: Peter Fonda stars in the ad for the Mercedes-AMG GT Roadster. Buick Hey look, it's Cam Newton playing Pee Wee football! Miranda Kerr also shows up to coach the NFL star in the spot for the auto company. Wonderful Pistachios The pistachio company will run two 15-second ads during the Super Bowl, including a new spot called "Treadmill": The ad will run during the first quarter, per Advertising Age. Wendy's The fast-food restaurant drew attention recently for roasting critics on social media, and the spat that started it all gets a callback for their Super Bowl spot: Lesson: Be sure you know your facts before you engage in Twitter trollery. Nintendo The video game company is debuting its first ever Super Bowl commercial to promote their new gaming system: Longtime fans of the company should love all the details crammed into the spot. Sprint Going morbid hasn't worked out well for companies (which we'll get into in our Worst Ad Ever section), but that didn't stop Sprint from scheduling this spot for the Super Bowl: The cell carrier plans to release an alternate version after the game, per Advertising Age. Ford Rather than promote a specific vehicle, the auto company will try and intrigue with its vision of the future: In related news, Ford announced its "FordHub NYC" experience. LIFEWTR PepsiCo's new bottled water breaks out the star power for "Inspiration Drops": Two-time Oscar winner Robert Stromberg directs the spot with music from John Legend. King's Hawaiian This will be the first-even Super Bowl ad for the Hawaiian food company: Look for it in the fourth quarter. Audi The auto maker jumps into the political fray with their spot about equal pay: "Daughter" is slated to air during the third quarter. FIJI Water The Wonderful Company is reportedly using an existing ad for the water brand's first-ever Super Bowl spot: It'll be the second spot of the day for the company, known for its pistachios. Budweiser In the commercial sure to stir up the most debate at your Super Bowl party, the beer giant is tapping into the recent immigration debate with "Born the Hard Way": Filmed in New Orleans, the spot is sure to spur a visceral reaction for many. Febreze The odor-buster attempts to capture the thing everyone at your Super Bowl party is thinking with "Halftime Bathroom Break": Turning away from the TV at halftime, of course, means missing a chance to see Lady Gaga's performance. KFC One Colonel Sanders isn't enough for the fast-food company in this Super Bowl spot: That's Rob Riggle, who has previously starred in KFC's ads, and Billy Zane. T-Mobile The cell company calls upon Rob Gronkowski, Terrell Owens and a bespectacled Justin Bieber for this year's Super Bowl spot: Send T-Mobile your touchdown dances and they could be retweeted by Bieber himself, which is something. Tiffany & Co. The jewelry company is tapping Super Bowl LI halftime performer Lady Gaga for their spot. Here's a preview: You can read more about Gaga's plans for halftime here. Top five Super Bowl ads ever 5. Volkswagen (2011) Of all the more recent ad spots, this one sticks out: Can you get any more adorable than a mini-Darth Vader trying to use The Force? 4. Budweiser (1989) The first Bud Bowl was held during Super Bowl XXIII: The spot would have seven sequels throughout the '90s in arguably the most memorable long-running ad campaign in Super Bowl history. 3. Apple (1984) While not as sports-centric as most of the top ads on this list, there's no denying the debut of the Apple Macintosh its spot: The Super Bowl spot was the only time Apple ran this ad, which is arguably among the top commercials of all time. 2. McDonald's (1993) The fast-food company landed a pair of iconic NBA stars to battle over their burgers and fries: I'd watch these two go at it in a head-to-head shooting contest today. Get on it, McDonald's. 1. Coca-Cola (1980) Could it be anything else?

Credit: Apple More like this Tim Cook responds to US presidential vote Apple’s Tim Cook speaks on Apple’s A.I. plans Tech companies come out swinging against immigration ban Video Mingis on Tech: The iPhone 7, Apple Watch 2 -- and the gadget guy! If unity is strength then Silicon Valley has never looked more unified as execs from across the sector and beyond come together in opposition to what many in world now call Donald Trump’s "Muslim ban." ‘Heart-wrenching’ Apple CEO, Tim Cook, told the Wall Street Journal that “hundreds” of Apple employees have been impacted by the ban, forcing the company to consider legal action. Cook explained that in one case an Apple employee who is expecting a child learned that the grandparents of that child will be unable to visit the infant when it is born because they hold Canadian and Iranian citizenship. Cook says he is in contact with “very, very senior people in the White House,” to urge a repeal of the ban. “More than any country in the world, this country is strong because of our immigrant background and our capacity and ability as people to welcome people from all kinds of backgrounds. That’s what makes us special,” Cook said. “We ought to pause and really think deeply through that.” Opposition Apple does not live in isolation. Google, Salesforce, Microsoft, Facebook, every major technology company opposes these restrictions. Google is putting together a huge crisis fund to help people impacted by these rules, while Netflix CEO Reed Hasting called the order "so un-American it pains us all." Silicon Valley is and always has been patriotic. Apple co-founder Jobs always aimed to introduce products in the U.S. first, and worked incredibly hard to bring opportunity to the country. His father was Syrian born, but Jobs showed his national pride and gratitude through his actions. While the economics of manufacturing have changed, Apple has created almost two million U.S. jobs as of 2015 (including direct hires, third party suppliers and independent developers). Apple is already one of the country’s biggest employers. “Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do,” wrote Cook in an email to Apple staff. Expert help Technology firms are also concerned at other restrictions being mooted by the White House, including major H-1B reforms. The latter will have a hugely negative impact on the Valley, meaning that even while traditional manufacturing jobs are automated, tech firms will be restricted in their operations, which will limit the number of new employments they can create. After all, if a company can work with 1,000 experts from abroad on H-1B visas, but that work can then create 10,000 jobs in the host nation, who wins if the experts required to create that opportunity cannot be hired? Beyond tech Resistance to the measures extends far beyond tech firms. Ford CEO Mark Fields and Executive Chairman Bill Ford have voiced their opposition, saying, “We have to live by our values.” Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, MasterCard, Nike and Procter & Gamble have also expressed concerns. Opposition is being felt worldwide. In the U.K. almost 1.8 million people have argued against a Royal Visit for Trump. There is also concern that if he does receive that honor, the U.S. President apparently doesn’t wish to meet Prince Charles, because he does not want to discuss climate change with the U.K.’s future king. While it is a fact that U.S. history demonstrates determined disinterest in being ruled by royalty, it is not normal for visiting dignitaries to select which royal family members they meet, particularly if doing so means snubbing the next King of England. A U.K. patriot may see such lack of tact as an insult against the nation. Opposition to the ban now extends across an A-Z of corporate, national, and international people and entities. What makes the whole thing so sad is that the ban itself is ineffective in policing the very problem it claims to address: any determined, well-resourced criminal will avoid it by using a fake identity to enter the country. It is the innocent who will suffer it most.

Mark Parker, CEO of Nike, was the latest to denounce the policy in an email to his employees Sunday. “Nike believes in a world where everyone celebrates the power of diversity. Regardless of whether or how you worship, where you come from or who you love, everyone’s individual experience is what makes us stronger as a whole,” he wrote. “Those values are being threatened by the recent executive order in the U.S. banning refugees, as well as visitors, from seven Muslim-majority countries. This is a policy we don’t support.” Parker mentioned his concern for Sir Mo Farah, an Olympic medalist who feared he wouldn’t be able to return from Ethiopia to see his family in Oregon. “Nike stands together against bigotry and any form of discrimination. We’ve learned that on the field of play, where fairness and mutual respect are the rule, not the exception. Now, more than ever, let’s stand up for our values and remain open and inclusive as a brand and as a company,” wrote Parker. “We are at our best when we recognize the value of our diverse community.” Related Stories Which Republican Senators, House Members Are Against The Muslim Ban?

Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook, cited his immigrant great-grandparents and his wife’s immigrant parents in a Facebook post opposing the ban. “Like many of you, I’m concerned about the impact of the recent executive orders signed by President Trump,” he wrote.

In expanding its industry-leading technology platform, Medidata intends to eliminate system silos, providing customers with the ability to manage all content, data and workflows in a single, integrated platform that meets the most rigorous usability, scalability, performance and security requirements. Medidata has agreed to acquire CHITA, a cloud-based content management and collaboration system built on Box Platform, a suite of enterprise-grade content management and collaboration APIs from Box.

Published on February 01, 2017. Arra Yerganian, chief marketing and branding officer at Sutter Health. Most Popular After the tsunami of 2003, Arra Yerganian, at the time an executive at a home construction company in Northern California, was approached by a group of mothers who asked if he would match the proceeds of a bake sale they were holding to raise money for victims. When Yerganian later met with the Red Cross to hand over a check, he was struck by the altruism of the volunteers' impending missions. "The fact that they were so selfless in their dedication to humanity moved me in a way that I had never imagined," he says. Fast-forward nine months, and Yerganian was the chair of the Red Cross board. Fast-forward again, and Yerganian found himself at Sutter Health, recently recognized by IBM's Truven Health Analytics as one of the top five large healthcare systems in America. As Yerganian tells it, he found his career's calling in caring after others. Today, as chief marketing and branding officer, he's working to help Sutter Health do the same. When so many competing healthcare systems claim the same mission of high-quality care, it's Yerganian's duty to help Sutter differentiate itself, both strategically and meaningfully. His efforts so far have resonated. Yerganian recently received an Officers Award from The CMO Club, a prestigious honor bestowed on a marketing leader who brings his or her brand beyond the typical scope of marketing and growth to other functional areas of the company. The differentiating diagnosis "Sutter Health is a remarkable organization," says Yerganian. "We are an integrated team of clinical and nonclinical pioneers who are deeply rooted in our not-for-profit mission." As the leader of marketing and branding efforts, Yerganian has a big ship to steer, given Sutter Health's $11 billion in revenue and staff of 55,000. His hope is to set the organization apart from the sea of sameness that washes over healthcare marketing. According to Yerganian, the healthcare industry has a problem with brand differentiation because it largely still practices "lowest common denominator" marketing. "People talk about quality and expertise as if they're differentiators," he says. "Seems to me, everyone expects when they go to a doctor that they'll get quality care, and that their doctor is an expert in their field, right?" For Sutter Health, standing out requires a brand promise greater than just high-quality patient care. "As healthcare undergoes a transformation in America, it's about putting people first, rather than patients," Yerganian says. "It's about understanding and connecting with people and families on both an intellectual and emotional level." In other words, Yerganian and his department are actively changing the conversation towards the real people behind what other providers categorize as "the patient" or any other business would call "the customer." "That's what makes Sutter Health special and different from every other health system," he says. "We are the brand leaning in when others are leaning away." A targeted treatment A more humanized approach means that the marketing department spends more time nurturing relationships with existing patients than acquiring new ones. "I call this the 'love the ones you're with' approach," says Yerganian, adding, "and it is a big differentiator for us since so many healthcare companies are just trying to acquire as many customers as they can." One way that Yerganian's team fosters Sutter Health's existing relationships is by placing more emphasis on marketing for their individual needs. Taking cues from his time at Procter & Gamble, his team spearheaded the effort to create, essentially, a family of brands. "I had a vision when I arrived 16 months ago to create a brand management structure along the lines of service like heart care, cancer services, women's health…" he says. This involved not only big data and research, but also forging stronger ties with medical experts, bringing them into the marketing fold for more specific and relevant content that resonates across the brand. Take the "Smile Out" campaign, modified for each line of service. A person battling a sinus infection sees "Sniffle in, smile out," while orthopedic patients see "Limp in, smile out." This creates a coherent connection across very different practice areas. "Precision marketing," as Yerganian calls this, also helps the medical professionals and marketing team deliver a better experience for the people Sutter Health cares for. "When I think about emotional access," he says, "it's about how we care about and appreciate the people we work with. It's how our healthcare teams work together toward collaborative care so you are a person, not a statistic. These are the things that we are really striving to do every day that really separate us." And like a doctor on call, Yerganian anticipates little time for celebration. As Yergarian puts it: "We have in our DNA the spirit of doing amazing things for people every day -- we just need to bring those stories to light."

Now, don't confuse Bangladesh's industrial conglomerate Square Group's Mediacom with WPP's media buying-planning agency. Those are two separate entities. GroupM's MediaCom operates under the name of MBA in Bangladesh, we hear. And now for the rumours: The grapevine suggests the deal happened a couple of years too late and at a lesser valuation than what should have been the ideal case. Buried rumours of Balsara planning to sell Madison Media to a suitor (read: WPP) have resurfaced as well. But these are admittedly speculations. The kind that normally fetch "no comments" or "denial" from all parties concerned. Let's see what some of the neutral elements have to say about them: Meenakshi Menon, Chairperson, Spatial Access It is only logical that soon Madison too will be brought into the GroupM fold, unless there's some knight in shining armour to change the way things are going right now. Otherwise, it is a forgone conclusion and the likes of Diwan Arun Nanda or Sam Balsara are learning or have learned by now that you can't be in bed with an elephant without expecting to be squashed at some point. Greg Paull, Co-founder and Principal, R3 This would give GroupM India a higher share than anywhere else in the world, making it a challenge for those on the wrong side of it. For the competitors, there will be an ever increasing need to strive harder for innovation and creativity - as the "clout" strategy they use in other markets won't play well in India. It was always an odd deal with Madison, predicated on some legacy P&G business. Going forward, it completes a crucial gap in the global MediaCom puzzle. Pratap Bose, Co-founder, The Social Street The current deal obviously makes GroupM officially an even stronger entity in Indian media business. I don't think it changes much for MediaCom. GroupM has always leveraged its control over the agency, now it has statutory powers on top of it. That's all. If at all, it changes things for Sam Balsara, since his share in the agency (MediaCom) may have gone down. I wouldn't be surprised if a Madison acquisition is around the corner as well. But then everything is a speculation at this point. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

The designation isn't a legal one, but is a commitment to stand with immigrants and refugees following President Trump's ordered travel ban.  Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley says cities and companies benefit from refugees and immigrants, and he feels compelled as a Catholic to help. Credit WIKIPEDIA Mayor John Cranley says the designation makes sense for the city on several levels.

This is an issue of what’s good for the economy and clearly in a city that has companies like Proctor and Gamble and 8451, who are recruiting and bringing in people from all over the world, remaining immigrant friendly and supporting Statue of Liberty principles is not only morally right, it’s also good for business and its good for the business of this city.” Hamilton County Commissioner Todd Portune says the county will also strive to be immigrant friendly. Kelly Anchrum of Catholic Charities reports the arrival of four refugee families this week has been canceled by Trump’s four-month ban on all refugees.

But he doesn’t play where he was raised. “It’s all completely different than it was when I was growing up. The downtown is so much nicer. When I was a kid, you’d go to Bengals or Reds games, get back in your car and leave immediately,” Berry said. “Now, you’re walking around downtown. There’s been a big influx of entertainment, bars, restaurants. A lot of younger people are seeing this and coming back. It was cool for me to be away for a little bit and now, it’s like seeing different city.” Cincinnati is a city of tradition. Among the first founded after the American Revolution (it was named for a veterans’ society), it’s home to the country’s oldest professional baseball team, its first municipal fire department and its second oldest zoo. Cincinnati’s architecture is historic and influential. The Carew Tower inspired the Empire State Building and the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood just north of downtown calls itself “one of the largest, most intact urban historic districts in the United States.” And as the city is renewed, that heritage remains. Its annual Oktoberfest is the biggest in the country. Planet Futbol MLS receives 12 applications by expansion submission deadline Cincinnati had always considered itself a major league city. But its days as a 19th-century boomtown were long gone. Population within the city limits fell continuously during the second half of the 1900s, and Cincinnati faced many of the same challenges encountered by its Rust Belt brethren. But the rebirth Berry mentioned is real. Two years ago, Cincinnati’s economy was growing faster than that of any other Midwestern city. Although it’s only 98th in overall job growth according to Forbes, “a lot of younger people” really are returning. Last year, Forbes called it the nation’s top “up-and-coming city for recent college grads” and the 15th “best city for young professionals.” FC Cincinnati is a symbol of that renewal. The USL club already feels like it has been around for decades, although it played its first game just 10 months ago. Record-setting crowds at an historic stadium have that affect.  “Cincinnati has always been a sports town, an historic sports town. Everyone still loves the Reds. You love your team and you love to hate your team. We like to rag on the ‘Bungles.’ But the city has really been yearning for something a little new–something that’s different,” Berry said. “I grew up on the Big Red Machine and the Bengals teams of the ‘80s that went to two Super Bowls,” said Jeff Berding, who was a city councilman and Bengals executive for nearly 20 years before becoming FCC’s president and general manager. “We are a major league city and soccer is the world’s sport. It’s the growing sport in our country, and it goes hand-in-hand with a city on the rise. We’ve had over $1 billion in investment in the urban core …. Our timing was important because we knew that there was this wave, and we could ride the wave and then fuel its growth.” Overall, the metro area is ranked 28th overall in population and 36th as a media market. But Berding points out that if you combine Cincinnati with Dayton, which is some 50 miles to the north, it would rank 21st. “We’re certainly not New York City and we’re not Chicago. But I think as Portland and Kansas City have shown, you can be a next-tier media market and earn enormous support,” Berding said. “I think it’s a little easier in a middle-sized market to really capture the attention of the populace and become something that’s really important.” By June, there already was a tribute beer: "Blood Orange IPA". And then this fall, the men of 1-year-old FC Cincinnati were grand marshals at Oktoberfest Zinzinnati. It was as if one storied tradition met another. “When they introduced us over the loudspeaker, the roar and the applause from the crowd—everyone knows who we are, and they’re so excited about it,” Berry said. Ownership Group The man who intends to take FCC to MLS is a member of another Cincinnati institution: the Lindner family. The Lindners control insurance and investment company American Financial Group, which owns Great American Insurance. Their offices are in the Great American Tower, the 665-foot skyscraper that is Cincinnati’s tallest. AFG took in more than $6.1 billion in revenue in 2015. Forbes ranked the family as the 129th wealthiest in the USA with an estimated net worth of around $2 billion. Carl Lindner III is FCC’s majority owner. His late father, Carl Lindner Jr., owned part of the Reds in the early part of the 2000s, and his grandfather, Carl Lindner Sr., got the family up and running in the 1940s with a dairy business just outside Cincinnati that evolved into a chain of stores. There are eight additional minority partners listed on FCC’s website, including Berding and Cintas CEO Scott Farmer. Regarding the possibility of adding additional investors to support the MLS bid, Berding told SI.com that there are “others clamoring to join, and I think at the end of the day there will be some other leading Cincinnati executives and their families joining us.” Those commitments didn’t need to be nailed down by Jan. 31, the day MLS expansion applications were due. Lindner has more than enough to make things happen. Planet Futbol Mailbag: USMNT changes under Arena, Trump's impact on World Cup 2026 Stadium Plan The University of Cincinnati’s venerable Nippert Stadium does the job for now. But MLS requires a stadium designed with soccer in mind, so it isn't a permanent solution. Berding said FCC has zeroed in on two potential stadium sites, both of which are in the city’s urban core that stretches connects the river, downtown, Over-the-Rhine and UC. He wouldn’t provide details regarding the financing but said MEIS architects and principal Tim Lambert have been working on the stadium design. Lambert was involved in designing Red Bull Arena, StubHub Center, Toyota Park and Rio Tinto Stadium in MLS. He’s also working on AS Roma’s new arena. “We’re going to submit a plan that meets [MLS] requirements. Our application is going to show a soccer-specific stadium that work on two different sites in our urban core with a funding model where the numbers add up,” Berding said. “We’re going to continue to fine-tune the funding model, and that’s going to be a bit of ongoing work. But at the end of the day, we have a plan that can get it done.”  Berding, a youth goalkeeper who also was involved as a coach and administrator in local youth soccer, helped run the mid-1990s campaign that resulted in voter approval for the 0.5% sales tax increase that funded construction of new riverfront stadiums for the Bengals and Reds. Soccer and Sports Scene Berry was the 2012 MLS Rookie of the Year with the Chicago Fire. He was traded to the Philadelphia Union in 2014, got hurt and never felt like he fit in the club’s long-term plans. Then an odd but appealing opportunity arose—FC Anyang in South Korea. Berry took a chance, moved to the city outside Seoul and quickly became an automatic starter. The experience was challenging but compelling, and he could’ve stayed in 2016 or pursued options elsewhere. But home beckoned, and he could tell FCC was taking itself seriously. The club hired legendary U.S. midfielder and National Soccer Hall of Famer John Harkes as head coach and inked several players with MLS experience. Harkes had been waiting for the chance to manage a team, and he had a roster full of men who’d tasted MLS and “had a lot to prove,” Berry said. Planet Futbol D.C. United signs Ian Harkes, son of club, U.S. icon John, to homegrown deal The club made an instant impact. More than 14,600 fans showed for the USL regular season home opener last May, and nearly 20,500 came the following week. FCC finished third in the 14-team Eastern Conference and was upset in the first round of the playoffs by Charleston before a jaw-dropping 31,187 fans at Nippert. Berding said FCC already has more than 9,500 season tickets sold for 2017. “I enjoyed my time in Korea,” Berry said. “It would’ve been cool to stay a little longer, but I made the decision and I haven’t looked back. You can’t take away from this experience and playing at home.” There seems to be room for a third big-league team in Cincinnati. A long wait for titles helps provide it. The Reds have won one World Series (1990) in the past 40 years and ranked 25th in MLB attendance last season at 23,383 per game. The Bengals have those two Super Bowl losses in the 1980s, lots of recent playoff frustration and crowds that rank 29th in the 32-team NFL. On ice, the Cyclones play in the third-tier ECHL and are an affiliate of the Nashville Predators. Cincinnati had brief flirtations with soccer in the past, but nothing really stuck. There's been a parade of low-level teams, from the ASL’s Comets and PDL’s Kings to the A-League’s Riverhawks. But that, combined with a vibrant youth scene, never was enough to put the city on the national soccer map. The U.S. men’s national team has never played there and the women have made only three appearances, most recently in November 2008. Just 5,877 showed up to Paul Brown Stadium to see a scoreless draw with South Korea. MLS Pros FC Cincinnati is a phenomenon, and the prospect of having another raucous, colorful crowd it can point to as evidence of soccer’s American growth will appeal to MLS. The numbers at Nippert speak for themselves.  Lindner is wealthy and serious. Berding said the aim from the start was to play at the highest level possible, but ownership hasn’t exactly been pinching pennies until then. For example, FCC bought time on local stations, including the city’s CBS affiliate, so it could broadcast all home games in HD—because major league teams are on HD TV. There’s money coming in from the rest of the city as well. A year ago, well before it played its first game, FCC had 17 corporate sponsors signed up. Toyota is its USL jersey sponsor. And as of 2015 the Cincinnati area was home to 10 Fortune 500 companies, an impressive number for its size. Among them are Procter & Gamble, Macy’s and AFG. MLS Cons As a media market (excluding Dayton), Cincinnati ranks last among the 12 cities competing for one of the four available MLS openings. Regardless of the crowds, that could be an issue for a league concerned about its TV ratings. In metro population, however, at least it's larger than Indianapolis, Nashville and Raleigh. There also may be some at MLS who aren’t convinced that last year’s crowds are sustainable. FCC’s season ticket numbers suggest they are, but the city hasn’t proven itself over the long term. Finally, there’s the issue of Columbus. The Crew’s Mapfre Stadium sits just 110 miles from Nippert. That’s not a long way between two major league teams in two mid-tier markets. The Crew have seen attendance rise in recent years, from a miserable 12,185 per game in 2010 to 17,125 last season. Perhaps Cincinnati, its fan base and corporate support would feel too close for comfort in Columbus. Or perhaps FCC’s entry would spark one of American soccer’s best rivalries. If MLS is unsure, that could work against FCC. There are other expansion options in the Midwest. For now, both clubs and the commissioner are saying all the right things. In a statement provided to SI.com on Thursday, Crew owner Anthony Precourt said, "These 12 expansion applications come from all over the United States, and it is exciting to see several markets close to Columbus in the applicant pool, including Cincinnati, Detroit, Indianapolis and St. Louis. Our Crew SC supporters have a chance to see some healthy new regional rivalries develop within MLS in the coming years." Kirk Irwin/Getty Images Commissioner's Thoughts “They've just got to keep doing what they’re doing because they’re doing it really well. We all need to be sure that all the elements that you need to be successful exist in the market,” commissioner Don Garber told The Cincinnati Enquirer. “Certainly, it seems as if it does in the short term, but we want to be sure, as I think ownership does as well, that that will make sense over the mid and long term." Regarding Columbus, Garber said, “We’re trying to capture that soccer thing, which are neighborhood rivalries … Our rivalry games that we have are our highest-rated games on television and I don’t think—we’re not thinking about putting a second team in Columbus. We’re thinking about putting it in down the interstate so that you can get a bunch of people in buses and cars trying to prove that they’re better than their neighbor. Should we decide to come here it will be creative and of great benefit to [the Crew]. There’s no doubt in my mind about that.” BACK TO TOP More Planet Futbol We've Got Apps Too Get expert analysis, unrivaled access, and the award-winning storytelling only SI can provide - from Peter King, Tom Verducci, Lee Jenkins, Seth Davis, and more - delivered straight to you, along with up-to-the-minute news and live scores.

Waiting to binge watch fun videos on YouTube, we’ve zoned out while enduring a painful 15-second commercial and clicked the “skip ad” button as soon as it appeared. What does this say about today’s digital consumers? It means a lot of people love to watch online videos that are interesting or relevant but they will shut off videos they dislike or have no interest in – which means most corporate advertisements on the web. Eyeing the rise of online video and relevant consumption needs, one former video producer and entrepreneur in Europe set out to transform the way that companies produce and position their online video campaigns with a new corporate video production platform -- Mosaicoon. Mosaicoon founder and CEO Ugo Parodi Giusino (Park Hyun-koo/The Korea Herald) “For me, it’s crazy for a company to keep on creating promotional content that people don’t like and want to skip, which currently makes up around 90 percent of the videos that brands make,” Mosaicoon founder and CEO Ugo Parodi Giusino said in an interview with The Korea Herald in Seoul. “Our mission is to help create good content that is relevant for users, which can be sponsored by companies or brands,” he said. Founded in 2010 and based in Palermo, Italy, Mosaicoon runs an online video marketplace platform that lets companies browse, purchase and build on pre-made professional videos created by artists, musicians, and creators worldwide. The company opened its Seoul office in June 2016. Creators worldwide will propose video projects of diverse forms and lengths -- ranging from a simple how-to video to high-quality nature documentaries and stand-up comedy sessions -- to Mosaicoon. Some 2,600 creators are currently active on the platform. Mosaicoon then tags these videos with keywords associated with the video’s content. With the help of artificial intelligence, the platform examines these tags to pick out relevant videos that match the values or themes a company wants to emphasize through a project. After making a selection, the company can sponsor the content -- whether it is simply embedding a company logo into the video, inserting an interactive link that brings the user to a particular website or product placement. “This is different from branded content or promotional content, which users dislike,” Giusino said. “Companies want to move in an approach that is more user oriented, so they have to give users content that is relevant to them.” In addition, Mosaicoon operates on a pay-per-view system for video projects created through the platform, allowing companies to easily test out various videos on the web and determine which storytelling strategies work. “You don’t have to pay a fixed price for the video. You pay only if the content performs,” the Mosaicoon CEO explained. “Much of the risk is eliminated. A company can purchase various content, see which performs in the best way, and concentrate investment in that kind of content.” For creators, the system provides an appealing incentive to produce good, effective videos, as they could rake in high profits if their content gets picked up by big-budget clients, he added. So far, Mosaicoon has carried out projects with around 250 big-name clients including Unilever, Proctor & Gamble, Lufthansa, Microsoft and Mercedes-Benz, as well as the European offices of Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics. Looking ahead, Giusino believes global video consumption will continue to quickly grow, and in turn boost demand for services offered by video production platforms like Mosaicoon. “Video is the new language of online. Users are looking at videos everywhere,” Giusino said. “Our goal is to give companies all the content they need to become publishers -- to produce content and communicate as their own media to their audience.”  By Sohn Ji-young (jys@heraldcorp.com) 영어뉴스를 통한 ListeningㆍReading 실력 향상 단기 학습 프로그램 [NEST] 1.

On the other hand, consumers in countries with dry weather, such as Brazil and Argentina, are more prone to purchasing sun protection products. Cosmetic skin care is one of the most dynamic markets in the personal care industry and is driven by evolving consumer trends and innovations on the part of manufacturers. The opportunity in the global cosmetic skin care market stood at US$127.1 bn in 2015 and this is projected to rise to be worth just over US$200 bn by 2024, expanding at a 5.1% CAGR therein. Download Research Brochure PDF@ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Multi-utility Skin Creams Gain Prominence among Consumers Cosmetic skin care products include those for anti-aging, skin whitening, sensitive skin, anti-acne, dry skin, warts removal, infant skin care, anti-scars solutions, mole removal, and multi-utility products such as beauty and balm, color correcting, and daily defense creams. In terms of revenue, anti-aging creams led the global cosmetic skin care market in 2015 owing to their diversified applications. Multi-utility skin care cosmetics, on the other hand, are expected to be the fastest growing product segment by the end of 2024. The main applications of cosmetic skin care products include stem cell protection against UV, flakiness reduction, skin rehydration, minimizing wrinkles, and increasing the viscosity of aqueous. Among these, the segment of wrinkle minimization led the cosmetic skin care market in 2015. The stem cells protection against UV segment, on the other hand, is anticipated to expand at a rapid pace due to increasing awareness regarding the harmful effects of ultraviolet rays. MEA to Offer Stiff Competition to APAC in Cosmetic Skin Care Market Based on geography, the global cosmetic skin care market is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa. While Asia Pacific is the leading cosmetic skin care market in the world, the Middle East and Africa is predicted to be the fastest growing regional segment. Accounting for a share of more than 40.0% during the forecast period, Asia Pacific is expected to retain its lead in terms of revenue through 2024. The rising adoption of beneficial skin care products in the emerging economies of China and India is one of the key factors driving the APAC cosmetic skin care market. These developing countries have been witnessing rapid changes in consumer living standards, which in turn, is expected to result in high market growth. Increasing purchasing power of the urban population, coupled with rising product awareness in rural areas, is also fueling the demand for cosmetic skin care products in the region. The cosmetic skin care market in the Middle East and Africa is expected to witness significant growth during the forecast period due to the increasing average disposable income level and the rising expenditure on personal care products among consumers. In addition, consumer preference toward skin brightening creams has fueled the demand for cosmetic skin care products in the MEA region. Over the recent past, companies manufacturing cosmetic skin care products have been adopting extensive marketing strategies to strengthen their position in the market. This is expected to further the cosmetic skin care market growth in the region. Key players in the cosmetic skin care market include L’Oreal S.A., Unilever PLC, Procter & Gamble, Beiersdorf AG, Avon Products Inc., The Estee Lauder Companies Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Kao Corporation, and The Body Shop International PLC.

RELATED COMPANIES EXPAND ADD TO Portfolio Watchlist OUTLOOK? +ve -ve Colgate x Loading data... ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ Budget 2017: Budget 2017 is out: Read how it impacts you and India 2017 is going to be the age of Twitter threads, that is if Twitter makes it till the end of the year, fundamentally unscathed or at least not as Altasomethingba (in which case it could be called Alt+thread for all you know). Earlier this month, the Twitterverse saw a 19-tweet long thread that essentially stated: "All shampoos and toothpastes are the same." It pretty much caused the kind of mayhem an unclaimed Rs 100 note can cause in a post demonetisation India. The user who started the thread works at a chemical manufacturing company that makes surfactants: chemicals that give shampoos, detergents, and toothpastes, their cleansing power. Since the user prefers to stay anonymous, we decided to refer to them as Rahul. A few weeks ago, Rahul heard from a friend who has recently switched to Patanjali products, not because of its advertising, but because of parental influence. "It worried me a little to see people's general lack of curiosity about the products they're using on a daily basis. It indicated that people are changing brands without questioning the need or rationale behind the change. A lot of people don't know what's going into their product." What got Rahul's goat was one of these uninformed customers claiming X brand of toothpaste/shampoo was better than Y. Having closely worked with a lot of FMCGs - Indian and international - Rahul could say with authority that all brands have more or less the same ingredients. "People just don't read them on the packaging guidelines. They are there for a reason - to inform the users." This triggered the rage-tweeting which ended up getting considerable traction. The reaction to those tweets provided a good insight into what determines people's trust in their brands. Here are some of Rahul's observations: Hard work is hard In spite of reiterating the importance of reading the ingredients, users kept asking Rahul, 'What about Brand A? Is it okay? What does it have?' "That's exactly what I asked them to find out. I'm not Google. Then there were some making blanket statements like 'sulphates are bad', 'parabens are bad'. There's nothing good or bad about these chemicals. Sulphates have been cleaning your teeth since ages and you've survived. Parabens keep your product from being taken over by mould or bacteria. So, if there are problems, it's all a function of individual sensitivity. And to counter that, one needs to read the back of the damn pack." But people want someone else to do their research. Snaptweets. (Source: BCCL) People get easily swayed by baba (Rahul) speak By and large, companies that harp on using herbal extracts also use the same key ingredients that the MNCs do, reasons Rahul. "People are willing to switch to another brand just because a Baba said something. It also speaks volumes of how much we buy into the spiel of ancient Indian Ayurveda as opposed to modern science." Case for truth in advertising Finally, Rahul feels a serious case needs to be made about truth in advertising, especially in this category. "Patanjali ads are wrong when they're bragging about their Swadeshi product. All products of HUL, P&G, Colgate, et al are manufactured in Himachal Pradesh, Haridwar, or Hyderabad. So, it's not like those companies are taking away our jobs or livelihood." Advertising will wake up when it will, but this mini Twitterevolution did wake up a section of users, albeit small, to the importance of checking ingredients before shouting, "My Brand Bestest."
