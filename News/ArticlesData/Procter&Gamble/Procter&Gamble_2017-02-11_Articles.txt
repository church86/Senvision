The Menlo Park social network, which came under scrutiny last year for repeated inaccuracies in its tools for measuring ads, also said that it will give marketers new options for buying video ads this year. For example, marketers might pay only if an ad was viewed to completion or if the sound was on. The nonprofit Media Rating Council will conduct an audit to “verify the accuracy of the information” Facebook gives marketers, the company said in a blog post, adding that it is also working with 24 third-party measurement companies. Facebook announced the changes after Marc Pritchard, chief brand officer at Procter & Gamble, demanded that the digital ad industry “grow up,” criticizing the different ways marketplaces, including Facebook and YouTube, define whether an ad has been viewed and the lack of accredited outside sources used to measure digital ad performance. While technology has let advertisers “venture where no creative has been before at lightning speed,” it has too often led to bad advertising accompanied by even worse viewing experiences, Pritchard said Jan. 29 at a conference held by the Interactive Advertising Bureau. He said that, as part of an effort to change the situation, Procter & Gamble will start accepting the Media Rating Council standard on ad viewability and work with measurement companies that are accredited by the group. If companies are not willing to comply, he said, they will lose its business. Procter & Gamble, with brands including Gillette, Crest and Charmin, is the biggest advertiser in the United States, spending $2.4 billion in marketing last year, according to Kantar Media. “We spend enormous amounts of time trying to understand, analyze and explain the differences between Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, Pinterest, Pandora, YouTube, and the dozens of different viewability standards claimed to be right metric for each platform,” Pritchard said, according to a copy of his remarks given to the New York Times. “Think about that for a moment. It would be like each NFL football team having a different standard of yards needed for a first down.” Facebook, which made nearly all of its $27.6 billion in revenue last year from advertising, has been trying to win marketers’ faith back since September, when it apologized for overstating video viewership. The mistake, followed by other disclosures of erroneous measurements, spurred an industrywide reassessment of the metrics used by advertising marketplaces, which are drawing more dollars every year. Facebook’s revenue last year, for instance, soared more than 50 percent. The social network, in its post Friday, said it would provide marketers with new data on display ads, including the milliseconds they appear on a screen. Its new video ad buying options will include “two-second buying,” where at least half of an ad’s pixels are in view for two seconds or longer, which Facebook noted complies with the Media Rating Council’s video standard.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 11 February 2017 P&G Malaysia backs MRC viewability standards by daljit dhesi Nadiah: ‘For media buys, viewability is one of several important factors that we consider.’ P&G Malaysia is working closely with its partners to adopt the US-based Media Rating Council (MRC) viewability standards for digital media as well as reviewing agency contracts following the recent call by its parent Procter & Gamble Company (P&G) for greater transparency rules in digital advertising. Although the move has drawn mixed reactions from marketers and agencies, the company’s communications and government relations leader (Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei) Nadiah Syed Nahar tells StarBizWeek that it will follow through and adopt the MRC standard. P&G Malaysia is a subsidiary of Procter & Gamble Company of the US, which is the biggest advertiser in the world. She says P&G’s ruling are relevant and applicable globally, including in Malaysia. Many of P&G’s digital partners (Google, Facebook, etc) are global, she says, adding that the company will work with its partners and agencies on these issues. “Right now, at minimum, our focus is on the adoption of MRC viewability standard to enable comparative measurement and learning. For media buys, viewability is one of several important factors that we consider. We work with our partners on the specifics as to how we buy media from them. We are also currently reviewing agency contracts. “I can’t divulge at this stage except the fact that we are aligned with P&G’s chief brand officer Marc Pritchard’s direction and intent of reviewing agency contracts. We have begun that work and it will continue on the timing that it takes,” she says. MediaCom is P&G’s media agency in Malaysia. Last month, Pritchard stressed that there was a need for a thorough review of all media-agency contracts plus requirements that everyone use industry-standard viewability metrics, fraud protection and third-party verification. The new rules scheduled to be out this year include requiring funds to be used for media payments only, ie, payments or fees should be matched with the services rendered. All rebates, at the same time, should be disclosed and returned as well as transactions being subjected to audit. Another is the endorsement by P&G of the controversial MRC viewability standards for digital media. It defines a viewable impression as requiring a minimum of 50% of pixels in view for one consecutive second for display and two consecutive seconds for video. Industry players agree there should be a common viewability standard in the advertising industry in the country as currently there are no fixed standards or measurements.  Tags / Keywords: Earnings , Economy , Advertising & Media , P G Related Stories MAS brings unity to new heights Malaysia an important part of China’s Asean expansion Serba Dinamik debuts on Bursa with 2 sen premium TA Global subsidiary completes Trump hotel acquisition F&N sees margins to remain pressured, acts to maintain revenue and profit growth You May Be Interested Mah Sing on transformation mode BBCC developer signs deal for Zepp concert hall Leong has come a full circle Spritzer starts UK exports P&G Malaysia backs MRC viewability standards Experiencing painful menses?

Attracting about 111 million viewers based on Nielsen's estimates, Super Bowl 51 wasn't the highest-rated game of all time, but it might be the most memorable. From the on-field dramatics, to Lady Gaga's halftime show, to innovative marketing approaches, the NFL's big game delivered on all fronts. Here are the greatest lessons marketers can take away from the Patriots-Falcons showdown. The classic call-to-action still works One of the most memorable commercials of Super Bowl 51 was a spot by 84 Lumber showing a mother and daughter immigrating to the United States. The commercial showed only the beginning portion of the ad and asked viewers to visit the brand's website to see the conclusion. The strategy proved to be so successful that the promoted website crashed from too many visits. Find the sweet spot between humor and strange There was something inherently awkward about watching a woman flirt with a cartoon Mr. Clean in this year's P&G Super Bowl spot. And yet, there was something captivating about it. It's this borderline between strange and humor that led Business Insider to deem this ad Super Bowl 51's most memorable commercial. Hashtag marketing is only getting stronger Sports are always a social experience, and social media analytics provider Netbase estimates that this year's big game hashtags — including #SB, #SB51, and #superbowl2017 — generated about 86 billion impressions. And while the Patriots were the ones to take home the trophy, Airbnb was the big winner when it came to social media, receiving the most overall engagement with its hashtag #WeAccept. According to social analytics platform provider Socialbakers, Airbnb was mentioned 854 times by Twitter users during the big game, and #WeAccept received an average of 25,757 interactions per tweet. Take relevant risks It's no secret that it's a politically divisive time in the U.S., with people ardently for or against President Donald Trump, his new administration, and his policies. Many brands decided to use their Super Bowl 51 ad time as a podium to voice their opinions. The response was not always positive, but it did create impressions. Take Budweiser, for example. The beer company released a commercial called “Born the Hard Way,” which depicted the immigrant beginning of the brand. According to marketing technology company Amobee, Budweiser's digital content engagement increased 606% since the ad first appeared online. Stay social There were 27.6 million Super Bowl tweets and retweets across the globe between the hours of 3:00 P.M. and 11:00 P.M., according to Netbase. And between 3:00 A.M. and 12:00 A.M., Facebook and Instagram engaged a combined 110 million people who generated 400 million interactions, including posts, comments, and reactions. These social audiences provided brands and marketers with a wealth of opportunities to communicate and interact. Loading links....

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 11 February 2017 Omnicom quarterly revenue misses estimate OMNICOM Group Inc, the No. 1 US advertising company, reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue due to a strong dollar, following prominent political events such as Brexit and the US presidential election. Revenue, for the company which is one of the “big four” ad agencies, rose 2.1% to US$4.24bil, but missed analysts’ average estimate of US$4.26bil, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. New York-based Omnicom, whose clients include Apple Inc, Procter & Gamble, McDonald’s Corp and Adidas, said negative impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue in the fourth quarter by 1.8%. The dollar had risen 6.8% against a basket of major currencies in the quarter ended Dec 31. The company did not break up revenue by geography in its quarterly report. However, according to Thomson Reuters data, about 38% of Omnicom’s total revenue in 2015 came from outside the Americas region. Omnicom said organic revenue in North America rose 0.6% in the latest quarter. Subsidiaries of Omnicom and fellow competitor Publicis Groupe SA were subpoenaed by the US Department of Justice in December, as part of an investigation whether ad agencies had rigged bids to favor in-house production units. Rival Interpublic Group of Cos Inc earlier in December said that one of its domestic agencies had been contacted by the DoJ as part of the investigation. Advertising companies have been exploring new revenue streams and are trying to keep up with clients’ increasing demand for video content. The company's net income rose to US$348.7mil, or US$1.47 per share, in the latest quarter, from US$328.3mil, or US$1.35 per share, a year earlier.
