College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Top Dividend Stocks in Consumer Staples A look at three top-notch dividend payers in this defensive sector. Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) May 27, 2017 at 1:07PM Consumer staples companies -- household products makers like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and beverage makers like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) -- are generally regarded as some of the best dividend stocks on the market. These are stocks that tend be defensive by nature, as demand for products like toothpaste is stable no matter what the overall economy is doing. Thanks to their strong collection of brands, they also tend to have solid profit margins, which enables them to return billions of dollars in capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. For investors looking to balance out their portfolios with some defensive, consumer-based dividend stocks, here are three choices that won't disappoint. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Altria  Altria (NYSE:MO), the Marlboro parent and former parent of Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM), is one of the best-performing stocks of the last 50 years when dividends are included. Despite smoking's decline in the U.S., Altria has been able to grow profits by raising prices and introducing products in new categories like e-cigarettes with its MarkTen brand. Cigarettes have proven to be incredibly inelastic products -- U.S. consumers pay upwards of $10 for a pack in some states. While much of that cost goes to taxes, it's allowed cigarette-makers to lift their own prices, inflating profit margins. As an addictive product with no good substitute, cigarette makers like Altria will continue to command wide profit margins. And as compensation for the risk of a declining market, investors have the huge potential upside of Altria getting in on the marijuana market if legalization continues to spread. As the country's largest cigarette-maker, Altria is ideally positioned to take advantage of such an opportunity. For dividend investors, Altria remains a solid bet with a 3.5% dividend yield -- and while not technically a Dividend Aristocrat because it cut its dividend proportionally after spinning off Philip Morris in 2008, the stock's history is the same as that of an aristocrat. Most recently, its annual payout hikes have been in the high single-digit range, and investors should expect that pattern to continue. 2. Anheuser Busch/InBev Fellow vice stock Anheuser Busch/InBev (NYSE:BUD) is the world's largest beer-maker, with a market cap of over $200 billion. AB InBev has consolidated its dominant position through a slew of recent acquisition, including most prominently its $103 billion takeover of rival SABMiller last year. AB/InBev has also acquired a number of smaller craft brewers and leveraged its marketing and distribution muscle to grow sales. At a time when American drinkers are turning away from traditional macrobrews like Bud Light, that ability to acquire smaller brands has helped fuel growth and protected the company from competition. The beer-maker is a solid dividend payer as well, offering a 3.5% yield. Since the company is based in Belgium, the dividend increases and payouts are affected by exchange rates, but it lifted the payout by 20% in its most recent hike, though it said following the merger with SAB Miller that it expected dividend increases to be more modest as it deleverages the debt from the deal. With the SAB Miller acquisition behind it, an unmatched global distribution network, and a strong position with craft beers, the company should be a reliable dividend payer for years to come. 3. Pepsico Soda has been a tough business in recent years as Americans turn away from sugary substances, but Pepsico (NYSE:PEP) is much more diversified than investors might think. In addition to Pepsi and other sodas, the company also owns Frito-Lay snacks, Quaker Foods, and dominant non-carbonated beverage brands like Tropicana and Gatorade. Pepsico's diversification and savvy management have helped it steadily grow profits, outperforming competitors like Coca-Cola in the process. In 2016, core constant currency earnings per share increased 9%, or 12% when the deconsolidation of Venezuela is factored in.  As a dividend payer, Pepsico has long been a solid bet: it's a Dividend Aristocrat, having raised its quarterly payout every year for 44 years in a row. The food and beverage company's recent dividend increases have been in the 7% range, a solid clip for a reliable dividend payer. The stock now offers a yield of 2.9%, and its status as a Dividend Aristocrat seems secure with a payout ratio of 69%. With 22 billion-dollar brands under its umbrella, Pepsico should continue to be a steady and reliable dividend stock.   Jeremy Bowman has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Indian society is being transformed by the decline of the centralized bureaucratic state and the emergence of a market economy. Gurcharan Das will describe how sustained high growth rates are leading to the dramatic rise of the Indian middle class, the breakdown of the caste system, changing attitudes toward entrepreneurship, and a new political dynamic. According to Das, that “silent revolution” affecting one-sixth of humanity has far-reaching implications for the future of liberalism in the world.

That’s how you survive.” – Cecilio Pedro It all started with a young boy’s passion and willpower to create change in the community. Cecilio Kwok Pedro, the founder and president of Lamoiyan Corp., did not build his empire overnight. He endured failures and disappointments along the way that made him the person he is today. Blossoming entrepreneurial mindset When he was still studying, he used to sell ball pens to his classmates. Surprisingly, the pens ran out fast, but most if not all were purchased in credit. At this stage of his life, we can already see an entrepreneurial mindset waiting to blossom. The journey continued right after college; he opened a hardware store in Alonzo, Manila. The area is known as the hub for hardware stores and a new entrant will have difficulty in penetrating the market arena. The competition was so stiff that he ended up closing his business.  In the mid 1970s, he once again ventured in a new investment. This time he opened Aluminum Container Inc. The company was one the suppliers of the aluminum toothpaste packaging to large fast moving consumer goods companies such as Procter and Gamble, Unilever and Colgate-Palmolive. During that time, aluminum was the most trusted raw material for that item. The performance of the business was driving smoothly until his clients opted to change the material they used from aluminum to plastic. It was an end of an era that forced suppliers to eventually close their company. This hiccup did not allow Cecilio Pedro to lose hope; in fact, he once again took the risk. This decision led to the birth of one of the largest Filipino-owned fast moving consumer goods companies, known as Lamoiyan Corp., maker of Hapee toothpase. Leading by example True to its tagline of “Making the difference for the glory of God,” Cecilio Pedro is a strong believer of social responsibility. He is not only focused on generating profit, but his push is also to contribute to the environment and community. I think they are the first corporation who employs people with hearing disability. With this gesture, hope was restored to these hearing-impaired employees.  The reality is people with disability are given unequal opportunities in the society, which in effect, destroy their moral and self-importance. As much as possible, he really wants to help by leading by example. His main intention is to encourage other businessmen to also be socially active in helping the community. Making the dream a reality The entry and involvement of deaf people in the daily operations was not easy for the company. A lot of adjustments were made in order to achieve a peaceful and productive working environment. The management and its employees were also taught sign languages in order to communicate with them. I admire how he integrated Corporate Social Responsibility to the company’s thrusts. If you come to think of it, hiring someone with an impairment may be a big challenge. But he followed his heart and made his dream of making a difference a reality. As future Lasallian business leaders, this is something that we can emulate from Lamoiyan’s founder so we can be that change in our own communities. The author is an MBA student at the Ramon V. del Rosario College of Business. This essay is part of a journal he kept in fulfillment of the requirements of the course, Lasallian Business Leadership with Corporate Social Responsibility and Ethics.  Visit his blog at https://thegreenchatterbox.wordpress.com/.

Baker / Published: May 28, 2017 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     ROBERT BAKER / STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Horse and buggy rides added to the Christmas spirit last December in downtown Tunkhannock. On the eve of a new historical walking tour through Tunkhannock unveiled last summer, Mayor Norm Ball responded to a question about all the good things that seemed to be happening to Tunkhannock. “I wish I could take credit for it all, but the truth of the matter is that we have great groups of volunteers who know how to act when they see a need,” he said. About 20 years ago, tractor-trailer rigs carrying products from the mammoth Procter & Gamble plant 5 miles away in Washington Twp. clogged Tunkhannock’s main thoroughfares —Tioga and Bridge streets — to the point that normal business traffic was reduced to a crawl, taking a half hour to move just a couple of miles. Enter Joe DeMarco, chairman of the borough’s bypass committee, who once described his role in making the road a reality as being “a burr under people’s saddles.” The $26.5 million Tunkhannock Bypass was dedicated on Nov. 7, 2001. Almost overnight, the downtown could breathe again, and the public warmed to the idea of a business district with a “real” future. A year later, local resident Hildy Morgan spearheaded the notion of taking a rundown theater there closed since the 1980s and resurrecting it. In 2011, Morgan passed the mantle of caring for what by that time had become a four-theater Wyoming County Cultural Center to Erica Rogler and Margie Young, and it has become a magnet for economic development in town. “No, they weren’t trying to make money, but people saw the Dietrich (theater) as something positive that others wished to build on,” said Beth Bevan, who now serves as president of the Tunkhannock Business and Professional Association. “On a personal level, I also believe it provides a great opportunity for old-fashioned dating, and we need that in our lives.” TBPA Executive Director Nancy Parlo noted that people from Clarks Summit and Dallas — as well as Wilkes-Barre and Scranton — were telling her they’d rather go to a movie in Tunkhannock than head to one of the regional multiplexes, and besides, they could eat in one of the local restaurants and visit the town’s quaint shops before a movie. While the Dietrich was coming into its own, Wyoming County Commissioner and businesswoman Judy Kraft Mead spearheaded a streetscape development with grant money that not only improved the sidewalks in the business district but added 87 Victorian-style lampposts to give it an antique ambiance. Almost simultaneously, a new library and hose company headquarters moved into more modern spaces. Tunkhannock’s future began to look rosy in 2006 when the Marcellus gas was identified as being beneath the local citizens’ feet and it seemed cost-effective to bring it up by a process known as fracking. On the last weekend of September 2009, Wyoming County Recorder of Deeds Dennis Montross estimated that roughly $230 million in lease money changed hands between Chesapeake Energy and Wyoming County landowners. With money in their pockets, a boom was forecasted locally, and almost overnight two hotels — the Hampton Inn on the east end of town, and the Comfort Inn just across the river from Tunkhannock — had a groundbreaking. And almost simultaneously, the Prince Hotel, which had stood on the corner of Tioga and Bridge streets for 167 years, was sold, with buyer Samir “Sunny” Mehta promising to upgrade the landmark by pumping into it what some claim was close to $1 million. Then two things happened. The price of gas on the world market dropped precipitously, and Tunkhannock itself was ravaged by a flood in 2011 that saw water from the Susquehanna River get to its highest flood stage ever. That the area economy — and particularly the gas companies — had money in their pockets meant that cleanup efforts were expedited in ways that other river towns in the Wyoming Valley were not so fortunate to see. As the gas price has improved, drilling activity has returned to the region, but not with anything like the initial burst. The downtown district is feeling some pain, with some obvious storefront vacancies on Tioga Street as well as the closure of Seasons Restaurant, and announcements in the past 12 months that both the Prince Hotel and Brick’s Grocery Market are looking for buyers. It’s not cause for alarm, said Donna LaBar, who has worked as a real estate agent in Tunkhannock for 32 years and is a broker for Century 21 Sherlock Homes Inc. “I’ve seen cycles like this come and go,” LaBar said. Sometimes businesses have owners who experience life changes — such as those who retire — but have no one to take over the operation. “I don’t see it as negative,” she said. “These businesses have grown; they need to offer more parking and more services and things will improve.” Contact the writer: bbaker@wcexaminer.com We welcome user discussion on our site, under the following guidelines: To comment you must first create a profile and sign-in with a verified DISQUS account or social network ID.

Mr Joesley Batista, who unleashed a political crisis in Brazil last week with a plea bargain deal that accused Mr Temer of endorsing the bribing of a witness, resigned as chairman and will leave the board, effective immediately. He will be replaced by Mr Tarek Farahat, a former Procter & Gamble executive who is also a member of the JBS board. In last Friday's board meeting, the first since the crisis broke, JBS chief executive Wesley Batista also resigned from the vice-chairmanship of the board. Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up He was replaced by his father, Mr Jose Batista Sobrinho, as vice-chairman, but will remain as chief executive and maintain a seat on the board. Reuters reported last Thursday that the Batista brothers were coming under intense pressure from minority shareholders and Brazil's development bank BNDES to step back from the company, according to sources. One of the sources said shareholders demanded that JBS should not foot the bill for any fine as minority shareholders were not responsible for any corruption-related crimes. One of the sources said shareholders demanded that JBS should not foot the bill for any fine as minority shareholders were not responsible for any corruption-related crimes. The Batistas have already agreed to a plea bargain with prosecutors. However, the family-holding company J&F Investimentos - the controlling shareholder of JBS - remains locked in negotiations over a potential leniency deal for JBS. J&F's proposal to pay a US$1.2 billion (S$1.66 billion) fine was rejected by the prosecutors' office last Wednesday. The brothers' testimony, released last week, unleashed a political crisis in Latin America's largest economy which is still worsening. It included allegations that they bribed hundreds of politicians. JBS added that Mr Farahat will create and chair a new corporate governance committee.

And to help the companies meet it, utilities are changing their ways. By Diane Cardwell and Clifford Krauss New York Times  May 27, 2017 NEW YORK — Coal is on the defensive in the nation’s power industry. Even in coal country. The pressure to shift more of the country’s electric supply to renewable sources is not just a rallying cry for environmentalists. Some of the power industry’s biggest customers, such as General Motors and Microsoft, have made a commitment to clean energy. And to help them meet it — and keep them from taking their business elsewhere — utilities are changing their ways. Advertisement West Virginia, where coal is king, is no exception. Appalachian Power, the leading utility there, is quickly shifting toward natural gas and renewable sources such as wind and solar, even as President Trump calls for a coal renaissance. Appalachian Power still burns plenty of coal, but in recent years it has closed three coal-fired plants and converted two others to gas, reducing its dependence on coal to 61 percent last year, down from 74 percent in 2012. Get Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Chris Beam, the company’s president, made the industry’s shifting dynamics clear in an encounter with Governor Jim Justice, a Democrat, at his inaugural ball in January. “’Look, I’d like to see you guys build another coal plant,’” he recalled the governor saying. “And our answer was: We’re not going to build another coal plant.” (The governor confirmed the account, but added in an e-mail, “I’ll continue to encourage power companies to burn more coal to put our miners back to work.”) It’s the same story in Virginia, where Dominion, a leading utility based in Richmond — near where commercial coal mining got its start — designed a special rate to make it easier for Amazon Web Services and similar customers to buy renewable energy. Advertisement In Kentucky, a chance meeting between a state regulator and a Facebook employee ultimately led the Public Service Commission to advise utilities that they could offer customers renewable energy packages, part of an effort to attract new business and hold on to automakers such as GM and Toyota. And in Wyoming, the nation’s leading coal producer by far, Black Hills Energy worked with Microsoft to create a complex arrangement for the technology giant to get enough wind energy to fulfill current and future needs at Microsoft’s data center in Cheyenne. “I’ve not spoken to a single utility that’s truly holding on to a future of more coal,” said Brian Janous, who directs energy strategy at Microsoft. “They’re looking to attract, as in the Appalachian case, new customers, and those customers aren’t attracted by coal.” Almost half the Fortune 500 companies have adopted at least one climate or clean-energy goal, with 23 of them pledging eventually to run their businesses on 100 percent renewable energy, including Walmart, Bank of America, and Google, according to a recent report by the World Wildlife Fund and other environmentally minded organizations and investors. Though corporations are buying renewable energy across the country, energy executives and analysts say it is notable that the trend is taking hold in states where coal production is part of the economic heart and soul. Coal executives say they are watching the effect of the renewable-power demands on the coal industry, but it is a matter of rising unease. “We’re concerned about it,” said Harry Childress, president of the Virginia Coal and Energy Alliance. “We see the pressure from these companies is pushing power producers more away from coal, which is a cheaper power.” Appalachian Power’s switch from coal was in part pushed as a result of a summit meeting that its parent company, American Electric Power, held at its headquarters last fall with corporate giants including Walmart, Facebook, Hilton, Procter & Gamble, and Marathon Petroleum. Those companies stressed that if they were going to expand their businesses in AEP regions, they would need access to low-carbon energy. American Electric Power organized a second meeting in Washington in May that included Amazon, Caesars Entertainment, DuPont, Marriott International, and Starbucks. With the goal of attracting big business to coal country, Beam is in the market to buy, lease, or build a fleet of wind and solar power farms across West Virginia and Virginia. The goal is to increase Appalachian Power’s renewable-energy fleet to 34 percent of its power capacity by 2031 from 17 percent today. An announcement for a new wind farm in southern West Virginia is expected within weeks, as discussions with big companies — which American Electric Power executives refused to identify — continue. “Specific customers are looking specifically for renewables and to what degree you are moving toward a new clean energy economy,” said Nicholas K. Akins, AEP’s chief executive. “Shareholders are more interested in sustainability going forward and improvements from a climate change perspective and carbon emissions perspective.” Akins said American Electric Power, which serves more than 5 million customers in 11 states, intended to respond to the demands of customers whatever policies were dictated in Washington. He added, “We are trying to make our company long-term sustainable regardless of administration.” Loading comments... Top 10 Trending Articles Most Viewed Most Commented Most Shared Real journalists.

Oracle employees contributed to the two campaigns. Montana is an agriculture-heavy state, but technology has outsized influence in Washington. Ari Levy | @levynews Tuesday, 30 May 2017 | 7:21 AM ETCNBC.com SHARES William Campbell | Corbis | Getty Images Republican Greg Gianforte campaigns for Montana's House of Representatives seat vacated by the appointment of Ryan Zinke to head the Department of Interior on April 22, 2017 in Bozeman, Montana. Sen. Steve Daines predicted in early May that Republican Greg Gianforte would win the special election for Montana's lone House seat by 8 to 10 points. Gianforte won by 6. This wasn't pure guesswork. In addition to representing Montana for the past five years, first as a congressman and now as a senator, Daines is quite familiar with fellow Republican Gianforte. They worked together for 12 years at a customer relationship management (CRM) software company called RightNow Technologies, which Oracle acquired in 2012 for $1.5 billion. Before that, the former tech executives partnered on a construction project to build RightNow's headquarters in Bozeman. Montana's economy is heavy in mining, transportation and agricultural products like beef, barley and hay. But in terms of the state's representation in Washington, the technology industry — and one company in particular — now has outsized influence. @DavidMDrucker I think Gianforte may do better than that. Would guess 8-10, but my political predictions of late were worse than my March Madness bracket!— Steve Daines (@SteveDaines) May 8, 2017 On Thursday, Gianforte defeated Democrat Rob Quist, a singing cowboy, in a special election to replace Ryan Zinke, who President Donald Trump tapped as his secretary of Interior. The contest hit national headlines Wednesday night when an audio recording circulated of Gianforte at a campaign event bodyslamming a reporter from The Guardian who asked him a question about the health-care bill. At his victory party the following night, Gianforte apologized to Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs and said, "I'm not proud of what happened." Gianforte, who narrowly lost a bid to become Montana's governor last year, and Daines account for two-thirds of the state's representatives in Congress. The other is Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, who comes from a farming background. Gianforte earned a fortune from the sale of RightNow. He founded the company in 1997, and he and his wife owned close to a quarter of the business at the time of the acquisition. Daines was RightNow's vice president of the Asia-Pacific region. According to RightNow's 2010 annual report, the last before the acquisition, Gianforte and Daines owned a combined 75 percent of Genesis Partners, a real estate company that was the "landlord from whom we lease our principal offices in Bozeman." show chapters Oracle CEO on AT&T deal: Tremendous opportunity for collaboration    Thursday, 4 May 2017 | 11:17 AM ET | 03:49 RightNow competed with Oracle until they joined forces.
