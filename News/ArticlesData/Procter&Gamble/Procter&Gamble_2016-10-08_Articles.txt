Where experts and professionals share insights and inspirations to grow business and build careers A Strong Safety Culture – No and Hell No! Focusing on building a strong safety culture may get you to average, but it won't get you to world-class safety excellence. Oct 6, 2016 by Richard Fulwiler President, Technology Leadership Associates 5 Articles EMAIL Tweet Comments 0 What is in this article?: A Strong Safety Culture – No and Hell No! Transformational Leadership Advertisement Why would a seasoned safety and health professional make a statement like the title of this article? I am sure that to many safety and health professionals, this sounds like heresy. Focusing on building a "strong safety culture" will not lead to safety excellence. It may get you to average or even slightly above average, but it won't get you to world class. In order to achieve world-class safety performance, safety must be integrated into the culture of the enterprise. In other words, safety has to be part of the DNA of the enterprise, not something that is appended to it. Does an enterprise have a separate HR culture, quality culture, customer service culture, etc., or are these critical elements embodied in the overarching organizational culture? Great enterprises have a single culture that includes all critical elements, including safety and health. (Authors note: When the term "safety" is used it is intended to include occupational health as well.) There is a myriad of articles in respected publications such as EHS Today that deal with achieving a strong safety culture. By this time, with the evolution of safety moving past the unsafe conditions phase and into the emphasis on behaviors of both management and workers and a management systems approach, one would think the concept of a strong safety culture versus having safety integrated into the overarching culture of the enterprise would be passé, but unfortunately, it is not. The culture of an enterprise is driven by the values of the enterprise, and the values of an enterprise are driven by the senior leadership of the enterprise. Therefore, safety initially must be embraced as a corporate value before it can be part of the enterprise's culture. The safety and health function of an enterprise can work tirelessly to improve safety performance, but if safety is not considered a critical or strategic value of the enterprise, these efforts will not permeate and influence the enterprise. Organizational Culture It is helpful to first develop an understanding of organizational culture. All organizations can be defined by their culture, which is a "system of shared assumptions, values and beliefs, which governs how people behave in an organization" (source unknown). There are numerous definitions for the term organizational culture (OC); however, the one stated above will be used because it represents the sentiment of many of the definitions we explored. An article presented a very interesting perspective of an OC in the May 2015 issue of the Harvard Business Review. In that article, Michael Watkins stated, "Culture is the organization's immune system." He goes on to say, "Culture is a form of protection that has evolved from situational pressures. It prevents ‘wrong thinking' and ‘wrong people' from entering the organization in the first place. OC functions much like the human immune system in preventing viruses and bacteria from taking hold and damaging the body." My point, using this analogy, is that safety antibodies must be part of this immune system, i.e., the OC. For example, suppose there is an organization where safety is not integrated into the corporate culture. It has a manager whose department excels in production but has a below average safety record, and he or she is up for promotion. There is a good chance he will get that promotion. Now, let's look at an organization where safety strongly is integrated into the corporate culture and the same manager has the same productivity and safety performance and is up for promotion. Will he be just as likely to get that promotion? Most likely he will not, since safety is an equal partner in the corporate culture and therefore is not subservient to other key performance indicators (KPI) such as cost, quality, production, customer service, etc. Driving H&S Excellence When "peeling the onion," we find six or seven critical characteristics that usually are used to describe OC. One of the common characteristics has to do with the relationship the enterprise has with its people, i.e.: does it truly value the wellbeing of its people? I was fortunate to have spent most of my professional career with Procter & Gamble (P&G). During that time, P&G's values and culture were embodied by the simple model: people, public trust and profit. What this says about the P&G culture is the employees (people)are what is valued most, then the reputation of the company and the reputation of its brands (public trust) and finally, its financial success (profit). Related Articles from Richard D. Fulwiler There is a powerful logic to this model. By valuing its people, P&G was able to install a high-performance work system that included a very high quality of work life of which safety was a significant, integrated component. P&G's business success required the company and all of its brands to have an extremely good reputation wherever they conducted business (public trust). The combination of an empowered workforce and high brand recognition would lead to economic success (profit). Safety and health plays a strategic role in each element of the model but there is no reference to "safety culture." Instead, safety and health is seen as an integral part of the key values that describe the culture of the organization. People: Safety and health professionals recognize that protecting people both inside and outside the fence line is our primary professional and ethical responsibility. Organizational leaders need to recognize that a truly engaged workforce will deliver much better results than a workforce that is not engaged. A strong safety and health effort is required to provide the quality of work life that leads to an engaged workforce. More will be said about the role transformational leadership plays on employee engagement later. Public Trust: This is an overarching term embracing the local and global reputation of the enterprise, as well as the reputation of its brands. It includes the concepts of integrity and high ethical standards. Workplace outcomes directly impact this. No CEO wants the enterprise or its brands to have a bad reputation. Senior management must recognize the critical role that safety and health plays in fostering a strong company reputation and protecting the company against a bad reputation. For example, consider the public and customer relations impact when a company gets a consent decree from the EPA, a huge settlement agreement from OSHA or a breakout of an occupational disease in the workplace. These typically lead to articles in the newspapers or stories carried on national and local TV and radio. Profit: Just a reminder that even if you work for a non-profit, you are not exempt from this final element since you would consider your budget to be akin to profit, i.e. they both are measured in $$$. Poor safety and health results directly hit the bottom line although the business case for safety and health has been poorly made by the safety profession. Consider the impact on productivity that a serious safety incident can have. The cost of injuries might not seem like a lot, but when converted to sales equivalent dollars it gets the attention of senior management. A $10,000 incident would require an enterprise operating at a 5 percent profit margin to sell $200,000-worth of products in order to yield $10,000 to pay for the incident. Another strategic contribution safety and health makes, but that is unrecognized by many, is that it is a technology enabler. Senior management must realize that without safety and health, the company would not be able to handle hazardous chemicals or utilize hazardous processes. Just think about it.

Bringing up baby — and hanging on to career Zara Kessler, Bloomberg 11:03 a.m. EDT October 8, 2016 The Mom Project matches women who want flexible work with employers who want them. (Photo: PROVIDED) Allison Robinson looks young for a mom, let alone a CEO. But, days from turning 30, she's both: the mother of a 14-month-old son and an even younger company, the Mom Project, which matches women who want flexible work with employers who want them. Robinson had been at Procter & Gamble since college, most recently working on the Pampers brand as a senior account executive for the North America baby care market and strategy team. While on maternity leave, she read about the many highly qualified mothers who leave their jobs. Returning to work after a leave can be difficult, and women's earning power can take a hit. "I felt like the decision of being a full-time career mom or a stay-at-home mom was too binary, and I wanted to create a solution in between, that allowed moms to stay professionally engaged through rewarding, challenging work to keep their skill sets current," said Robinson, who lives in Chicago with her husband, Gregory, a business operator at a private equity firm, and their son, Asher. Robinson never went back to P&G. In early April, she launched her "digital talent marketplace." The service, for which more than 6,500 people have signed up, is mainly for women but will help connect anyone with work ranging from project-based, its focus, to permanent. For employers, it can provide skilled female candidates eager to work in flexible roles. The Mom Project, free to job hunters, collects information on their backgrounds and aims and on companies' needs. In candidates, it looks for an undergraduate degree, at least, and five years of work, and verifies education and employment histories before someone gets an offer. Employers pay Robinson a service fee of 20 percent of what they pay their new hire. The business has signed up more than 150 employers, including Hyatt Hotels and Penn Mutual Life Insurance Co., and more than 50 have made a match or are close to making one. There are resources such as iRelaunch for women who want to return to work. Après has a job market, while the nonprofit Path Forward focuses on midcareer internships at companies for people following a caregiving stint. Robinson said she's looking to keep millennial women in the workforce, by letting them scale back when they have a baby. The brand new network currently has some older members. It took Kate Thomson, 37, to the marketing department at Penn Mutual, in Horsham, Pennsylvania. She's on-site Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. for an initial six months and has Penn Mutual's permission to maintain her clients in a consultancy she started in the summer of 2015. The setup allows her to get her five-year-old on the school bus for kindergarten and drop her two-year-old at preschool before work, then reverse the process on the way back. "So it's almost like they won't even know I'm gone," she said. "Which is sort of incredible." Before she began consulting, Thomson had spent 15 years in marketing and advertising, telecommuting the last several years but with a lot of travel. She came across the Mom Project on Facebook. "I want to wear clothes and talk to grownups," she said. "But I don't want to sacrifice my children's babyhoods for that, and I did that for a long time." Ten days into her new schedule, Thomson wrote by e-mail that things were going well. She was happy to be spending time with her kids, but "there's a special joy to be found in commuting BY MYSELF," she wrote, adding that "nobody is touching me or needing things." Still, untraditional work arrangements may not come with benefits, and years of project-based work could leave a woman ill-prepared to ratchet her salary back up for full-time work. And not every job pans out. Catherine Siris, 34, a millennial mother of two, had already left her career. The Hershey, Pennsylvania, resident has an MBA from George Washington University and completed Johnson & Johnson's human resources leadership development program. She hasn't been employed since she had her first child, who is 3. "I feel like I've lost a piece of my identity, because [career] was such a big part of my life," she said. The Mom Project submitted her as a candidate for a four-month, full-time, remote position in recruiting, which she thought would be a good test of whether she was ready to return to work full-time. Siris, who has also signed up for Après, recently learned from the Mom Project that the company is holding off on the role until early next year. Robinson doesn't have a monopoly on flexible work. The Second Shift helps find projects for experienced women; it takes a 5 percent cut when processing a member's payment from an employer and charges the employer 15 percent. MomSource Network charges users a one-time $50 fee and focuses on finding people flexible, long-term positions. FlexJobs, at $14.95 a month, with quarterly and yearly options, boasts tens of thousands of job listings. Prokanga offers a network of "vetted flexible talent" and charges that talent 20 percent of their payment. If Robinson's venture grows over time, it will be harder to maintain an intimate environment. Both Thomson and Siris had introductory calls after signing up. Now that isn't feasible, Robinson said, and the service is trying to engage women digitally. DELAWAREONLINE Study: DE Turf Sports Complex will boost Delaware economy And scale requires money. So far, Robinson and her husband have been financing the business themselves. The company is working toward closing a round of funding. Robinson took Thomson to a brick-and-mortar office. She may one day return Siris to work. Courtney Hyde, 40, found a job at the Mom Project itself. Hyde, who has a 3-year-old daughter, was working as an account executive for LinkedIn Talent Solutions when she saw a Facebook ad for the Mom Project. She signed up in March, before the official launch, looking for project-based or part-time work, wanting a sense of what was out there. Instead, she got a phone call from Robinson and, in June, joined the company full-time as vice president of sales, responsible for building and maintaining the base of its employer partners. A big company might want to support working parents, gain employment flexibility through peaks and valleys, or bring in an expert for a project without paying a consultant's fee, Hyde said. DELAWAREONLINE West Nile virus found at Dover Air Force Base prompts quick response Employers also come to the Mom Project, signing up on the digital platform. Interface, an Atlanta-based maker of modular flooring with a focus on sustainability, became a partner after Global HR Director Jillian Adams saw an article about it on LinkedIn and was drawn its similar focus on purpose. In the traditional staffing model, Adams said, you deal either with headhunters (or recruiting agencies) who find full-time professionals or with staffing agencies that fill temporary and permanent positions with less specialized workers. To find highly trained experts to work as consultants, it usually takes a formal consulting or specialized vendor, she noted. A mom Interface hired through the network will soon start a job in communications on a project basis. In the grand scheme of things, it isn't clear whether millennials or Gen X-ers or anybody will find it easier to navigate flexible work, keeping a baby toe in the workforce while caring for babies. On a smaller scale, there's Asher, who started walking several weeks ago, with both Mom and Dad in attendance. It was late afternoon, in their basement, where Robinson and her toddler hang out because it's carpeted. "I feel like I'm making sacrifices to make this model work," she said. "Being there was a taste of what I want to solve for."

The 271,000-sq. ft. building will house primary care offices, registration, a mental health space, physical medicine and rehabilitation, dental, women’s clinic. JOHN VALENZUELA — STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER By Jim Steinberg, The Sun Posted: 10/07/16, 6:19 PM PDT | Updated: on 10/07/2016 # Comments World World II veterans Norman Gibbs, left, of Banning, Augustine Martinez of Murrieta, VA Loma Linda Healthcare System Director Barbara Fallen and Robert Chism of Loma Linda cut the ribbon for the new VA Loma Linda Ambulatory Care Center in Redlands on Friday. JOHN VALENZUELA — STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER By the numbers New Ambulatory Care Center in Redlands $11 million - cost of the new facility 72,000 - veterans served in San Bernardino, Riverside and eastern Los Angeles counties 20 - years of planning 271,000 - square feet of space 2,015 - parking spaces 2,700 & 510 - employees and volunteers, respectively, 300 - veterans, political and civic leaders who attended Friday’s ribbon-cutting ceremony REDLANDS >> Gone are the days of operating out of a “shoebox.” The opening of a new 271,000-square-foot, state-of-the-art veterans outpatient treatment center Wednesday will unclog a congested Veterans Affairs Healthcare hospital campus, allow doctors to see more patients in a day, and enable the introduction of new services. Services at the VA Loma Linda Healthcare System’s new $11 million Ambulatory Care Center in Redlands will for the first time fully integrate primary care with behavioral health services, something not possible at the main hospital campus, the Jerry L. Pettis Memorial VA Medical Center in Loma Linda, said Barbara Fallen, director of the Loma Linda Healthcare System. Locations Ambulatory Care Center (ACC) 26001 Redlands Blvd., Redlands, CA 92373 Jerry L. Pettis Memorial Veterans Medical Center 11201 Benton St., Loma Linda, CA 92357 The Loma Linda system serves 72,000 veterans in San Bernardino, Riverside and eastern Los Angeles counties. Pettis Medical Center opened in 1977 and was built for 27,000 patients, Fallen said. After some 20 years of planning, more than 300 veterans, political and civic leaders attended a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new building, located at 26100 Redlands Blvd. in Redlands. It is less than 2 miles northeast of Pettis Medical Center. “We have been living in a shoebox,” Fallen said during her formal remarks prior to the ribbon-cutting Friday. The promise of more comprehensive and faster delivery of medical services occurs during an era of heightened awareness of deficiencies in medical treatment for veterans returning home after service in Iraq and Afghanistan. Outcry over lengthy periods veterans had to wait for appointments and other problems led to the resignation of longtime VA Secretary Eric Shinseki in 2014. He was replaced by former Procter & Gamble CEO Robert McDonald, who visited the construction site of the VA’s new ambulatory care center in 2015 and brought with him a message that he wants to get veterans “the care they have earned.” One of the legislative actions to come out of that turmoil was the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for Americans Act, signed into law by President Barack Obama in February 2015, which aims to reduce that number and improve the mental health of veterans who are transitioning out of the military. The Loma Linda VA is acting as a the regional lead hospital in a pilot program to widen the net of health care providers available to veterans, which is one of the goals of the act. “We need to do everything we can to ensure our veterans have access to timely and quality health care, so I’m glad to see increased services for Inland Empire veterans through the opening of the Ambulatory Care Center,” Rep. Pete Aguilar, who toured the facility Friday, said in a statement. Advertisement There was loud applause from the audience when Prachi Asher, VA Loma Linda Healthcare assistant director, said the new facility has “plenty of parking.” Veterans have long complained that finding a parking spot at the main campus is a nightmare. The new facility has 2,015 parking spaces versus 1,925 at the main campus, Asher said. “The parking is fantastic here,” said Richard Valdez, legislative director for Disabled American Veterans in California and past commander for both the DAV’s San Bernardino chapter and the state organization. Valdez was one of the ribbon-cutting attendees. In addition to shifting thousands of VA patients to the new building’s parking spaces, the transfer of 650 staff members to the new facility will free up those parking spots as well, Fallen said. There have been 50 new hires specifically for the Ambulatory Care Center, primarily in the areas of security, clerical, laboratory and cleaning functions, Fallen said. “The inefficiencies of staff crowding can be decompressed in the new building,” said Dr. Marion Sherman, behavioral medicine service chief for the Loma Linda VA. Therapy staffs were sharing a room at the main campus, and would often have to hunt for space to see a patient, she said. Primary care physicians often had only one room for patients in the older building, meaning they would need to wait for the next patient’s vitals to be taken. In the new building, primary care doctors will have up to three rooms, so they can quickly move from one patient to the next, Fallen said. “This building will allow us to make more efficient use of the staff that we have,” Sherman said. Because the behavioral medicine staff is integrated throughout the Ambulatory Care Center, a primary care physician can immediately call in a mental health professional if the discussion with a patient moves to areas that include, for example, nightmares, excessive drinking or anger management, Sherman said. That was not possible in the old building because of the distance between the two specialties and because the few patient rooms needed to be quickly turned over, Sherman said. Services offered in the Ambulatory Care Center will include primary care, mental health, physical medicine and rehabilitation, dental, a women’s clinic and patient education.

New York - Fabrizio Freda, the CEO of Estee Lauder, could tell the fragrance industry was changing by watching the members of his own family. His grandfather picked a signature cologne and never changed it, Freda says. But the executive’s son hasn’t shown that kind of loyalty - a typical attitude for younger consumers. If they wear cologne or perfume, they switch between niche brands and opt for smaller bottles. “The new generation really looks at fragrances as a wardrobe but not anymore as a personal signature,” the 59-year-old said in an interview. Many millennials don’t want mass-market perfumes, and celebrity scents -- once a vibrant part of the industry -- have fallen into decline. But so-called artisanal fragrances are surging. Sales of the products, which sometimes come in offbeat varieties, rose 22 percent last year, according to the research firm NPD Group. That made them the fastest-growing fragrance segment. In short, millennials no longer want to smell like Justin Bieber or Britney Spears - they’d rather have the scent of a smoky fireplace or old lipstick. And they don’t want to wear the same perfume every day. Merger mania Merger deals also are reshaping the industry and intensifying competition. Revlon Inc. agreed to buy Elizabeth Arden Inc. this year, teaming up with a large maker of celebrity perfumes. And Coty Inc. is poised to become the world’s largest seller of fragrance when it completes its purchase of Procter & Gamble Co.’s 41 beauty brands this year. Premium scents have kept the industry growing despite a slump in mass-market perfumes and colognes. The $6.6 billion market for US artisanal products and other premium fragrances is projected to grow 18 percent by 2020, according to Euromonitor International. Mass-market fragrances, meanwhile, are forecast to drop 15 percent. Celebrity brands were once seen as key growth drivers for Elizabeth Arden and Coty. But sales in that category dropped 31 percent in 2015, according to the NPD. Coty Chairman Bart Becht said his company plans to refocus on top designer brands, such as Marc Jacobs and Gucci, while cutting out some other names. Elizabeth Arden, which gets three-quarters of its sales from scents, also could shift more toward premium names under Revlon. Estee Lauder, best known for cosmetics and face cream, has used on the artisanal trend to fuel growth. Its fragrance sales increased faster than any other segment besides makeup last year. And the scents are more profitable than some designer-label products because they don’t require the same advertising and promotion, Freda said. Promising Estee Lauder’s Frederic Malle, Le Labo and By Kilian scents might not be known to most consumers, but they are some of its most promising fragrance brands. It also sells scents under the more recognisable names of Tom Ford and Jo Malone, offered in such varieties as nutmeg, ginger, and wood sage and sea salt. “A lot of people won’t have heard of these brands, but that’s what makes them cool because it’s not the same fragrance that you smell on everybody walking down the street,” said Eleanor Dwyer, a beauty analyst at Euromonitor. “It’s a discovery that you made. You liked it, and you bought it - and you’re wearing it.” For the past five years, the top brands in the US have been dominated by European companies, Chanel and L’Oreal, according to Euromonitor data. But New York-based Estee Lauder has climbed the charts with its Jo Malone scents. The label jumped to the No. 9 spot last year, up from number 24 five years ago. Angela Lopez, who works in finance in New York and wore Chanel No. 5 in her college years, is an example of a millennial shopper looking for something different. “I used to wear what’s popular, but I don’t want smell like everyone else now,” said the 31-year-old. “There are some perfumes that you smell everywhere. I like to discover new names and buy from small boutiques. It’s more expensive, but it’s worth it.” Rollerball size That attitude has prompted the industry to adopt smaller sizes, such as rollerballs that come in at around 10 milliliters. That’s the fastest-growing form of packaging, with an increase of 50 percent or more last year, according to Euromonitor data. Most other sizes either dropped or grew less than 1 percent. Rollerball-size fragrances can cost less than half the normal price, making it easier for budget-conscious millennials to try out new scents, said Karen Grant, a beauty analyst at the NPD. That could then build a foundation for the future. “A younger consumer is able to discover, experiment, carry it with them,” Grant said. “Different formats provide access to even higher-end fragrances, so then they are ready to graduate into a full fragrance.” BLOOMBERG Hungry for more business news?

Shots Studios rebrands from selfie app to social star video factory Posted Oct 5, 2016 by Josh Constine (@joshconstine), Katie Roof (@Katie_Roof) 0 SHARES Next Story InkHunter’s AR tattoo app exits beta on Android as startup looks to wider, B2B play Twitter once tried to buy Shots for $150 million to score its 3 million rabid teen users, a source tells TechCrunch. But the Justin Bieber-funded selfie app developer dreamed of a different destiny, where it would become the “Saturday Night Live” of the mobile generation. The Shots app grew to a peak of almost 8 million users, but ultimately it was too difficult to compete with Instagram and Snapchat. Despite a shift to comedy and acquisitions like lo-fi video capture app Camcorder and music video maker Mindie, the Shots team decided they were better off as a content creator. Social media stars from Vine, Instagram and Snapchat befriended the startup. The Bieber affiliation gave it credibility, and co-founder John Shahidi’s “I’m on the creator’s side” stance fostered trust with multi-million view video makers like Lele Pons and Rudy Mancuso. Shahidi discovered that as long as these web celebs kept pumping out funny skits, their fans would follow them from one social media platform to the next. So over the past few months, Shots has rebranded as Shots Studios, and turned its focus from apps to the content people share on them. It’s taken stars who built their fame in still Instagrams, 6-second Vines and off-the-cuff Snapchat clips, and helped them shoot high-production four-minute YouTube videos. The result? Millions of views per video, strong ad revenue and, according to a source close to the company, sudden partnership interest from Facebook, Netflix and Verizon that could potentially spill into acquisition talks. With the help of Shots Studios, former Vine star Lele Pons racks up millions of views on her YouTube videosShots has now signed deals with social stars Lele Pons, Rudy Mancuso and his show Awkward Puppets and Anwar Jabawi. They have exclusive deals with Shots which takes a revenue cut of their earnings that John Shahidi wouldn’t specify but that he called “creator friendly”. In exchange, creators get access to a production team including a film crew, writers, and editors; brand management; sales help; and access to Shots’ data and growth teams. While the startup declined to comment on specific discussions, Shots Studios insists that they are not focused on selling the company right now. Their new business model has been building momentum and the company is a few months away from profitability, due to ads and partnerships with Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola and American Express. Shots will still run its app, but the team is concentrating on video production and distribution. Related Articles More Than A Selfie App, Shots Produces Original Videos With Puppets (And Bieber) Shots acquires Mindie to build a teen video app empire Justin Bieber-Backed "Shots Of Me" Launches Selfie Sharing App Content creation has become a growing business, with mobile video consumption skyrocketing in the past few years thanks to better cameras, screens and wireless networks. Advertisers are looking to reach these viewers, particularly in the young demographic that Shots caters to, and video ads pay much more than their annoying banner cousins. If executed correctly, Shots’ plan could ultimately lead to a big exit for the company. Maker Studios was acquired by Disney for more than $500 million. Fullscreen also found a lucrative outcome.  Anything at or above that original $150 million price Twitter dangled would be a big win for Shots’ investors. It has raised $15 million in funding; investors include 500 Startups, Floyd Mayweather and Major League Baseball. And Shots’ most famous investor, Justin Bieber, is more involved than ever. The star got his own start on YouTube and we’re told that he’s very enthusiastic about helping the next generation of artists. And that concept of creating as a team could be Shots’ greatest strength. Each of its affiliated stars do cameos in each others’ videos and cross-promote them to their own fans. That strategy let the Shots family of stars become the oligarchy ruling Vine’s Popular page. Now the startup will give them the spotlight for a lot longer than six seconds. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Shots Studios Founded 2013 Overview Shots Studios is a data-driven entertainment company that creates comedy sketches and music for Millennials.

Terry Shropshire, Managing Editor and Web Editor Leave a comment 588 reads ATLANTA — If there was one person who encapsulated the essence and excitement for the very first Black Women’s Expo in Atlanta that founder Merry Reed wanted to bottle up and shake all over the Georgia World Convention Center, it was the renowned Sasha the Diva, the irrepressible and effervescent host for KISS 104.1 FM. “It’s going to be a great day, a great weekend, particularly with Keke Wyatt,” she exclaimed with unabashed exuberance for the multifaceted event that takes place from Oct. 7-9 at the GWCC. “Let everyone know how absolutely amazing it is. Thank you, Merry Reed, for believing in our dreams (of black women) and coming here and it’s just going to grow and become huge for Atlanta!” Sasha the Diva entertains the crown as Black Women’s Expo founder Merry Reed (center) laughs resoundingly. Merry Reed, the visionary for the nationally-respected Black Women’s Expo that annually draws in 15,000 to 20,000 to the Chicago convention center every year, brought along a superstar starting squad of sponsors and partners to bring the Black Women’s Expo in with the type of fanfare that it deserves. “This is our very first Black Women’s Expo and we are just very excited to be here. We’ve been in Chicago for the past 22 years. This is a great expo for African American women – and men – and the whole family comes to our show. There is so much to do and so much to experience for everyone,” Reed said. The Black Women’s Expo is coming strong a cadre of stars and dignitaries, including professor and inspirational speaker Dennis Kimbro, relationship expert Stacii Jae Johnson, actress Elise Neal, singing sensation Keke Wyatt, Kindred Spirits and fashion aficionado and coif connoisseur Derek J, one of the stars of “Real Housewives of Atlanta.” And it was apropos that the first-ever event in Atlanta that Reed and the Black Women’s Expo would align with the intercontinental conglomerate Proctor & Gamble and their “My Black is Beautiful” campaign. “I’ll tell you why we decided to join forces with the Black Women’s Expo,” said Grace James, brand manager for My Black is Beautiful. “Come over to our booth and you can get your hairstyles, t-shirts, goodie bags, whatever you like. We’re very excited to partner with Merry Reed. We want to partner with any local groups and national groups we feel are making a difference in the black community — #SheMatters. We are very excited to be the presenting sponsor for Black Women’s Expo.” The Black Women’s expo also partnered up with Walgreens, which is offering half-price tickets, as well as My Family Insurance and Black Lives Matter, who said they wanted to support the black-centric extravaganza. Also in the house is General Motors, who are displaying a fleet of brand new Chevrolets for the attendees to take out on ride-and-drives, including their Camaros and Malibus.
