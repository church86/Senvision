Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 19 November 2016 KTC sees good year ahead by toh kar inn Company feels confident after winning Procter & Gamble, Anakku distribution rights CONSUMER packaged goods distributor Kim Teck Cheong Consolidated Bhd (KTC) is looking to a stronger year ahead, having been awarded several distribution rights and being on track to grow its network. Recently, KTC was appointed distributor for Procter & Gamble (P&G) and Anakku products in East Malaysia. While the distribution of Anakku baby products in East Malaysia contribute about RM1mil to RM1.5mil to KTC’s monthly revenue, P&G products generate a monthly revenue of RM11mil in East Malaysia, plus BND800,000 (RM2.47mil) from sales in Brunei through Ben Foods (B) Sdn Bhd. To name a few, brands like Gilette, Ambi Pur, Febreze, Downy, Head & Shoulders, Oral B and Pantene are under the umbrella of P&G, an American multinational consumer goods manufacturer. It is learnt that the group was looking to secure the distribution of a major confectionery and beverage brand to secure distribution rights which would give it the mass market presence. KTC executive director Dexter Lau (pic) tells StarBizWeek that the group will acquire four additional warehouses to support its distribution business, on top of the soon-to-be completed acquisition of a distribution arm for the Brunei market. The completion of Grandtop Marketing Sdn Bhd’s acquisition will see an estimated earnings contribution of BND1.4mil (RM4.32mil) per month to KTC’s earnings. “We are in the midst of finalising some paperwork for the proposed acquisition of Grandtop Marketing, so we are on track to completing the acquisition by December 2016. “The 60% stake acquisition of Grandtop Marketing will provide us with a wider network of 600 sales and distribution points in the Brunei market. “In addition to extending KTC’s footprint out of East Malaysia, the procurement of Grandtop Marketing will also add multiple brands to our brand portfolio, as it already has distribution rights for brands like Nestle, Maggi, Milo, Silky Girl and Revlon,” says Lau. Lau added that KTC is considering to expand the Anakku brand to Brunei and maybe even the Asean region, though there are no firm plans to date. KTC is involved in three business streams, namely, distribution of third party brands, manufacturing of bakery products and distribution of its own brands, Orie and Creamos. Lessons to learn It was a learning curve for KTC after it reported net losses in the third quarter ended March 31, 2016 (Q3FY16), amounting to RM1.67mil. According to a Bursa filing, the loss was mainly attributed to weak consumer sentiment coupled with erosion of margin on sales of new beverage products, as well as inventory write-offs of expired beverage products. However, the group was quick to turn to black, as it registered net profit of RM1.06mil in the immediate quarter. “We have since cleaned up our balance sheet and having learnt from this bitter experience, we will continue to be vigilant and better manage the risk factors. “Our revenue and gross profit margin is still there, so we just need a couple more quarters to recover from this provision. “We expect to grow our revenue by some 30% to RM450mil in FY17,” says Lau. For FY16, KTC registered revenue and net profit of RM341.13mil and RM1.85mil, respectively. A year since being listed on the ACE market, KTC has completed most of the business plans as set out in its prospectus. To date, the group has spent an estimated RM8mil from the RM21.3mil raised from its initial public offering (IPO). This means that only 37% of the funds have been utilised. Lau elaborates that RM9mil from the remaining fund is allocated for the purchase of properties like warehouses, which the group is actively scouting for. Bulk of the expenditure was on the expansion of KTC’s facilities and acquisitions of distribution chains to support the growing business. For example, three months prior to distributing P&G products, KTC had to heavily invest in the necessary facilities and adequate manpower to cater to the influx of P&G products. “During this period, we incurred a lot of cost as we had to house twice the usual volume of stocks prior to commencing the distribution of P&G products. “We had to prepare sufficient racks to ensure efficient warehousing of P&G products, as well as purchase additional vehicles, forklifts and machineries to support the logistics part of our operations. “New employees were hired three months prior, to be trained and regularised for daily operations that were to come,” says Lau. In Sabah, the group’s manufacturing facility now measures 20,596 sq ft as compared to the previous 5,600 sq ft facility and a new warehousing facility in the midst of construction will be operational by the end of 2017. As for Sarawak, KTC has acquired a warehousing facility and a distribution company. KTC’s plan to establish a manufacturing facility in Sarawak will be put on hold for the time being, as with its plans for its own brand bakery products to enter into new markets. This is because the group aims to focus on stabilising the distribution business of P&G and Anakku products before embarking on expansion of its bakery product line. “We want to ensure that our operations are in place and running efficiently, before we establish a bakery manufacturing facility in Sarawak. P&G is our largest partner currently, contributing at least one third of our monthly revenue,” explains Lau. Collectively, the warehousing capacity for Sarawak has increased from 25,360 sq ft to 120,863 sq ft, mainly to support the distribution of P&G products. In total, KTC has 15 distribution centres in Sabah, four in Sarawak and two in Labuan, with warehousing capacities of 226,142 sq ft, 120,863 sq ft and 19,526 sq ft, respectively. Sales of KTC’s bakery products, which are marketed under the Creamos brand, have been sluggish. The sluggish sales were prominent in areas such as Lahad Datu, Sandakan and Tawau in Sabah, where businesses have slowed down due to the recent kidnappings. “We are struggling to meet sales, but we are not overly upset about the situation. “We have the financial capability to weather through the sluggishness, which we believe will eventually turn around. “Hence, we will continue building on our fundamentals,” says Lau. Although KTC’s bakery manufacturing division only contributes about 5% of the group’s revenue, the group believes that there is still growth opportunities in the division. Lau says that the low income group relies on Creamos products due to its affordable prices. Coupled with the nature of the manufacturing division being complementary to KTC’s distribution operations, KTC is not slowing down or discounting on this segment. In fact, KTC will continue to grow its own brands by adding new products to the Orie brand line up. The group will introduce peanuts and chocolates in the near term, with aims to market more snacks that are priced below RM1 in the future.

E mais, será que isso traria benefícios a sua empresa ou a você como líder? Sei que você deve estar curioso para saber a resposta a esta pergunta, mas antes vou te contar uma história: Anos atrás, um dos químicos da Procter & Gamble, ao chegar em casa foi indagado pela sua esposa: - Você parou de fumar? - Não! Por quê? - Suas roupas não estão com cheiro de cigarro. Para ele que vinha desenvolvendo um novo produto químico, foi como se um alerta disparasse. Ao voltar para sua empresa no dia seguinte, passou a testar à exaustão a tal solução que parecia eliminar os maus odores. A cada teste o produto se mostrava mais poderoso. Era impressionante! O mau cheiro desaparecia magicamente! A P&G então, acreditando no potencial do produto, passou a investir milhares de dólares na produção de um spray, com o nome de Febreze e com uma campanha de marketing agressiva, que visava distribuir milhares de amostras no mercado, mas passaram-se meses e as vendas não decolavam. Os estoques mantinham-se repletos do produto e a empresa tentava desesperadamente descobrir como posicionar o produto e escalar as vendas. Para compreenderem o que acontecia, começaram a visitar as donas de casas. Muitas delas relatavam que haviam usado o produto por um tempo, mas acabaram abandonando-o no fundo do armário. Era evidente que, se não conquistasse o hábito de uso, não haveria também a rotina da compra. A P&G então contratou peritos em psicologia do consumidor para tentar superar a possível objeção e reverter o prejuízo que tendia a aumentar cada vez mais. Voltaram a visitar residências que apresentavam interesse pelos produtos inibidores de maus odores, como casas de fumantes e pessoas que conviviam com animais, como cães e gatos. A conclusão que chegaram é que as pessoas habituadas a conviver em ambientes com maus odores eram incapazes de detectar a maioria desses odores. Os fumantes, por exemplo, invariavelmente, perdem a sensibilidade ao cheiro, que, ao contrário, é facilmente percebido por outras pessoas. Portanto, o gatilho, que iria deflagrar o interesse pelo produto era insatisfatório, não fazia despertar o interesse. Desse modo, a estratégia de marketing posicionando o Febreze como um produto que prometia proporcionar benefícios diferenciados, mascarando odores desagradáveis com perfumes, não se mostrava muito assertiva. Além de que essa proposta já era utilizada por concorrentes bem estabelecidos. Não se evoluiria, portanto, para uma rotina de uso do Febreze. O que você faria nesta situação? Bem, segundo os pesquisadores contratados pela P&G. não havia mais nada a fazer dentro da empresa e a resposta deveria estar com o próprio consumidor. Assim, para compreender a experiência do consumidor, a equipe do Febreze passou a dedicar inúmeras horas dentro das lojas e casas dos consumidores “ouvindo” o que eles tinham a dizer. Dentre tantas visitas, resolveram acompanhar de perto uma dona de casa que dizia adorar o Febreze. Ela usava o produto todos os dia, mas, para surpresa dos pesquisadores, a casa não parecia um lugar com problemas de odores. Não havia moradores fumantes, nem possuíam bichos de estimação. A pergunta imediata dos pesquisadores foi: Por que você usa o Febreze? E ela respondeu de forma simples: - Bem, meus meninos estão entrando na puberdade e o quarto deles mantém um constante cheiro de vestiário. Eu uso Febreze de um jeito diferente, faço assim: limpo normalmente os cômodos e quando termino dou um toque final com produto. Nesse momento um dos pesquisadores detecta um padrão quase imperceptível. Pediram então para acompanhá-la em um dia de limpeza. E o que constataram? No quarto ela fez a cama, ajustou os travesseiros, esticou os lençóis e ao final borrifou Febreze na colcha lisa. Na sala, passou o aspirador, recolheu os sapatos dos filhos, endireitou a mesa de centro e novamente aplicou o spray no carpet limpo. E justificou: “Borrifar é uma pequena comemoração quando eu termino de limpar o cômodo”. Agora, estava claro para os pesquisadores: Havia um gatilho que era a necessidade de higienizar o ambiente. A rotina era a ação diária de limpeza. E a recompensa que faltava era o aroma final de casa limpa. Até então, o marketing da P&G havia se equivocado ao posicionar o produto como um eliminador de odores. O que os consumidores desejavam era uma fragrância final como uma sensação agradável, exaltando o trabalho pronto. Isso iria, definitivamente, caracterizar o fechamento do loop dos hábitos. Depois dessa constatação a P&G decidiu transformar o produto em um perfumador de ambientes, com um design marcante e rótulos que mostravam janelas abertas e ar puro entrando pela casa. Com essa sutil mudança na campanha publicitária as vendas começaram a disparar e a P&G que esteve a beira de descontinuar o produto, alcançou sucesso e sustentabilidade nas vendas ao alavancar as receitas em mais de 1Bi U$ por ano. Finalizando, você pode concluir que as inovações tecnológicas são necessárias, mas não suficientes para criarem inovações lucrativas que os consumidores desejem comprar. A resposta para que se faça algo diferenciado e que possua benefícios e atributos únicos estará sempre no consumidor.

Hitting shelves across the country this fall is the latest innovation in Tide’s ongoing commitment to sustainability: Tide purclean, the first bio-based detergent with the cleaning power of Tide. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161117006439/en/ To celebrate this step in the right direction, Tide is teaming up with Grammy® Award-winning, Canadian singer-songwriter, and advocate for the environment, Nelly Furtado, to introduce the brand’s new partnership with WWF-Canada, in support of their Count for Nature movement. “As a parent, I consider the products, and their ingredients, that I use at home and with my family, as well as making sustainable choices whenever I can. This includes how we conduct our laundry—washing with cold water, limiting the amount of loads per week and choosing the right laundry detergent,” said Furtado. “I’m thrilled that a brand I trust, like Tide has created an environmentally-friendly laundry detergent that actually works, but is also gentle on fabrics. I’m honoured to team up with them as they launch NEW Tide purclean and work with Tide to bring attention to WWF-Canada’s Count for Nature movement, and invite Canadians to take action with me.” Starting today, until November 30, 2016 at 11:59PM EST, every time someone tweets to @Tide, sharing an action they take to help the environment, using both #purclean and #CountForNature, Tide will donate $1 to WWF-Canada’s Count for Nature Campaign. “WWF-Canada’s Count for Nature movement is driven by the knowledge that what each and every one of us does for nature counts towards the health of our planet,” said David Miller, president and CEO, WWF-Canada. “With the support of Canadians and partners like Tide purclean* and Nelly Furtado, we are able to work towards a future where nature, wildlife and people thrive together. “Whether it’s planting native plants, or getting outside to clean up your local shoreline, we encourage everyone be part of the action by counting yourself in.” “Tide purclean is an important next step in our journey to create detergents that help consumers make sustainable choices,” said Corinne Durieu, Fabric Care Communications Manager, P&G Canada. “We believe that in order to create a more sustainable future, we need to make products that people use every day more environmentally friendly. That's why we made sure that Tide purclean has the same cleaning power of Tide, is hypoallergenic and free of dyes, chlorine and phosphates but is also 65% bio-based, and made using renewable energy sources.” With a 65 per cent bio-based formula, as certified by the USDA BioPreferred seal, Tide purclean cleans as well as Tide Original liquid at stain removal, whiteness, color care, and the ability to clean in energy-saving cold water. The detergent is produced at a zero manufacturing waste to landfill facility using 100 per cent renewable wind power electricity and the bottle is also 100 per cent recyclable. Tide purclean is available in 32 loads and 48 loads sizes in a light Honey Lavender fragrance and an unscented version, with suggested pricing of $12.99 and $14.99, respectively, and is available at retailers across Canada.

BioPreferred is transforming the marketplace for biobased products through two initiatives: mandatory purchasing requirements for Federal Agencies and Federal contractors and voluntary product certification and labeling. Biobased products span a diverse range of applications, such as lubricants, cleaning products, chemicals and bioplastics. The USDA Certified Biobased Product label communicates a product’s biobased content. Usually expressed as a percentage, biobased content is the ratio of non-fossil organic carbon (new carbon) to total organic carbon in a product. New carbon is derived from recently-created materials. The total organic carbon in a product consists of new carbon and old organic carbon that originates from fossil carbon materials, such as petroleum, coal, or natural gas. Approximately 2,500 products have earned the USDA Certified Biobased Product label as of May 2016.

Subscribe for $59/Yr - Save $50 P&G Just Unloaded 100 Brands. Now What? Marketer Will Even Out Spending, Up Broad-Reach TV and Embrace 'Open Sourced' Creative By Jack Neff. Published on November 18, 2016. Most Popular Procter & Gamble Co.'s belt-tightening on agency and production costs isn't over, but the focus appears to be more on production now. And its increased spending on media looks to benefit the biggest social-media platforms and "broadly appealing" TV shows, based on the company's analyst day Friday in Cincinnati. Credit: Courtesy Procter and Gamble P&G didn't unveil many new initiatives, but provided some color on how it plans to rekindle growth just 49 days after completing the bulk of its massive divestiture of more than 100 brands. While P&G has been increasing media and sampling spending, that doesn't affect all line items equally. The focus is on "reach and continuity," said Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard, with brands such as Tide, Pampers and Febreze increasing reach 10% to 20% in the U.S. while still focusing on their most important consumer segments. That effort has included "shifting to more broadly appealing television shows and also higher-reach digital platforms," he said. On the TV side in particular, the move seems to reflect what some brand managers privately have said for years in the face of optimizer-driven buys that moved funds into thinly watched cable shows – that they saw better results from broader-reach primetime shows. Related Stories Mystery Solved: P&G Responsible for Competitors' Woes P&G's Pritchard: Time to Cut the Crap -- and the Pressure on Agencies P&G Hires New Global Media Director From Mondelez in Push to Hire More Outside Talent Big Hike in Ad Spending Helps P&G Beat Expectations, but Agency Cuts Continue Tongal Hires Former Saatchi P&G Client Lead To Woo Big Clients On "continuity," P&G is moving away from media schedules that vary month to month in order to "balance spending more evenly across months and quarters to enable top-of-mind awareness year round," Mr. Pritchard said. Even Vicks has spread its advertising out more, he said, because "40% of colds actually happen outside of the winter." Marketing costs are P&G's "third largest spend pool behind people and product," he said, noting that the company has focused on productivity by reducing spending on agency fees and production by $620 million, or around 30% from three years ago to around $1.4 billion, in part by cutting the number of agencies it works with in half to around 3,000. Those cuts haven't fallen entirely evenly. Juan Fernando Posada, president of the Latin America Selling & Market Operation, said P&G has cut these so-called "non-working media" costs by $100 million in the region – accounting for around 16% of P&G's overall reduction, even though it represents only around 8% of company sales. Those cuts haven't hurt Latin America sales, which grew 8% organically last fiscal year, he said, well ahead of the company average. More broadly, Mr. Pritchard said, "We reassigned several brands to higher-quality partners, and we cut the workload to produce far fewer but much better advertising and marketing campaigns. "Companywide there's still plenty of opportunity, as we're still spending around $500 million in advertising production around the world," he said, though agencies aren't entirely off the hook. Future efforts to improve marketing productivity will include using "digital technology for production, pooling production and also using open sourcing in creativity in our work to create advertising both within and outside existing agency networks," Mr. Pritchard said. He pointed to P&G's high-end SK-II beauty brand, which has "open sourced its advertising at about 50% the cost of traditional ads." A spokeswoman noted that agency-of-record Leo Burnett came up with SK-II's broad "Change Destiny" campaign, but that briefs for individual projects within the campaign have been given broadly to other agencies in and outside Publicis Groupe. Independent Forsman & Bodenfors, later bought by MDC Partners, created the widely honored "Marriage Market" ad in China as part of that campaign. As Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller described it, P&G's divestitures have gotten it out of businesses that rely on "self expression in fashion, flavor or fragrance and flavor" toward "daily use" categories driven more by technology and performance. And several P&G executives outlined ways they're doing that. President Global Fabric Care Shailesh Jejurikar noted that he still sees plenty of room to expand fabric enhancers such as Downy, still used by under 30% of households globally and 29% in the U.S. He hopes to build use of laundry detergent in part by encouraging people to do more frequent, smaller loads, which can save water and energy – while increasing use of detergent, particularly unit-dose Tide Pods. Chairman-CEO David Taylor noted that by launching a car air freshener that works in warm and cold weather alike, Febreze has energized a sleepy category the past four years, roughly doubling it to $500 million and capturing a roughly 45% market share. Olay, which has been struggling for years, continues to face sales challenges amid a 20% reduction in underperforming items, acknowledged Alex Keith, president-global skin and personal care. But its Regenerist Microsculpting Cream is the leading brand in its segment and saw 7% growth last year. And the Olay Eyes line launched this summer has captured a 9% market share and prompted double-digit segment growth while getting most of its users from outside the Olay brand, she said. Besides showcasing rising stars, such as Ms. Keith, Mr. Jejurikar and President Global Feminine Care Fama Francisco, Mr. Taylor also noted that the company is following through on his February pledge to recruit more talent from outside. As part of that, he announced the company's first hire of a line general manager from outside – former RB (Reckitt Benckiser) executive Paul Gama, who's coming to P&G as VP-personal health care.

P&G sees Trump fallout, hedge fund interest Alexander Coolidge , acoolidge@enquirer.com 4:42 p.m. EST November 18, 2016 Buy Photo Procter & Gamble's headquarters in downtown Cincinnati. (Photo: The Enquirer/Cara Owsley)Buy Photo Just as Procter & Gamble is looking to focus on growing its slimmed-down business, world events and market forces are putting new pressure on the maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers. Similar to Great Britain's unexpected "Brexit" vote to leave the European Union, worldwide currency and financial markets have reacted sharply to Donald Trump's upset presidential victory in the past two weeks. Several major foreign currencies have lost value since Nov. 7, threatening to worsen P&G's problems with exchange rates that had been stabilizing. On Friday, P&G executives stuck with their previous prediction that foreign exchange would dent total sales by only 1 percent in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017. The Cincinnati-based consumer products giant blamed unfavorable exchange rates for shaving 6 percent off company sales in each of the last two fiscal years, costing it $4 billion in lost revenue each year. "It's going to be tight in this quarter given the enormous changes in the last two weeks," said Jon Moeller, P&G's chief financial officer. Dozens of Wall Street professionals were visiting the company's Cincinnati headquarters for its annual meeting with analysts. In the days since Trump's election, the Mexican peso has lost 9 percent of its value versus the U.S. dollar. The Brazilian real and Japanese yen have lost 5 percent of their value relative to the dollar. Also, the euro has lost 4 percent, and the Russian ruble and Chinese yuan have lost nearly 2 percent. Weaker currencies versus a stronger dollar dampen P&G's sales and profits as its products become more expensive to overseas consumers and the profits that are booked lose their value when translated back into U.S. dollars. With only 41 percent of its sales from the United States, P&G is particularly vulnerable to currency woes. P&G is among two dozen major U.S. corporations listed on the S&P 500 doing less than half of its business in North America, according to Bloomberg. During the presentation, P&G executives said they were focused on the company's turnaround and did not discuss outside events. Chief executive David Taylor said the company was trying to balance growing overall sales while maintaining a healthy profit level. In the past, P&G has lost market share when it focused too much on profitability and lost money when it sought sales at any cost. "We've seen the movie when we've gone through extremes before and we don't want a sequel," Taylor said. Meanwhile, P&G officials declined to discuss a run-up in stock ownership by hedge funds, which hit almost 9 percent during the July-September quarter, according to Bloomberg. The hedge fund ownership percentage is now at a six-year high, according to Bloomberg data. It hovered around 2 percent for the last three years. Raymond James analyst Joe Altobello said investors are still sizing up the effects on P&G with Trump heading to the White House. "It's hard to say. If we do see faster economic growth it’s a modest positive for P&G," Altobello said. "That's tempered somewhat by currency and interest rate headwinds." P&G and other multinationals and consumer product companies have also taken short-term hits from Trump's campaign promises. Trump's vows to get tough on trade deals with Mexico and China have fanned worries of touching off trade wars, prompting a stock sell-off in multinationals. Trump's free-spending proposals to build a wall along Mexico and overhaul America's infrastructure have pushed up treasury yields, which is expected to increase interest rates and further strengthen the U.S. dollar as more foreign investors buy U.S. treasuries. P&G and other consumer staple stocks have declined as other sectors became much more appealing in the wake of Trump's win. Bank stocks have soared in anticipation of relaxing regulations. Investors have also moved money into the stocks of cyclical stocks such as industrials and materials companies that are expected to benefit from increased infrastructure spending. In the last month, P&G shares have declined 4 percent, while Clorox has dropped 6 percent, Church & Dwight and Kimberly-Clark have dropped 7 percent, Colgate-Palmolive has dropped 8 percent and Estee Lauder has dropped 11 percent. "P&G's stock price is now viewed differently as investors want to own stocks more that have more of a growth slant to them," said Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo. 46 CONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDIN 9 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2g6putu TOP VIDEOS Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 Use-of-force expert: 'The actions of Ray Tensing were justified' 0:50 Which stores are opening, closing Thanksgiving Day 0:34 \u0022I can't wait to see Tensing on the stand\u0022 0:55 Cincinnati Police Criminalist: Tensing 'seemed nervous or afraid' 2:59 Crime lab: No evidence on Tensing’s boots that he was dragged 4:07 Alternate juror in Ray Tensing trial has been dismissed 1:24 Born in Cincinnati, celebrated around the world: An anthem that unites us 3:39 Inside Prep Sports 360: Colerain Football prepares for playoffs 5:05 JP Macura looks ahead to the season 2:24

Needs to Succeed in 2017 Fox News Fox Business News 3 Brands Procter & Gamble Co. Needs to Succeed in 2017 By Demitrios Kalogeropoulos - November 17, 2016 102 Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) finally has the portfolio that it wants. With the recent sale of 41 of its biggest beauty brands, the company just finished a multiyear initiative aimed at whittling itself down to 65 franchises from over 160 in fiscal 2012. Continue Reading Below Management kept the remaining brands around for their impressive growth and profit potential. The franchises also represent areas where P&G already has a dominant market position and can more easily protect market share. While the consumer goods titan would love for its entire portfolio to post market-thumping growth, the Pampers, Tide, and Gillette brands will likely play the biggest roles in whether P&G’s sales rebound gains momentum next year — or falls flat. Pampers More From Fool.com Pampers is P&G’s single biggest brand, responsible for $9 billion of global sales per year. It anchors the company’s baby, feminine care, and family care division that’s responsible for 28% for the business and accounts for roughly one-quarter of net earnings. Image source: Getty Images. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT The key branded competition comes from Kimberly-Clark (NYSE: KMB) and its Huggies products. Until a few years ago, Pampers and Huggies were locked in a dead heat, with each claiming about 40% of the U.S. market. Since then P&G has pulled ahead to a comfortable lead. The bad news is that those gains haven’t been enough to offset losses on the value end of the market from its Luvs diaper line. Most recently, the baby care segment was P&G’s worst-performing division: It was the only one of its five segments to post lower average prices. Organic growth, at 2%, was below the company average. P&G has impressive structural advantages in place that can help it succeed with this brand, though. A network of strong relationships with hospitals, for example, helps deliver trial products to almost every new mom in the U.S. The company aims to pair that sampling strength with increased advertising spending and a bigger commitment to R&D spending to boost market share next year. Tide Image source: P&G. P&G has had the most innovation success lately in its fabric care division, and so it’s no coincidence that this segment leads the others by accounting for 32% of sales and 27% of profits. Management recently cited the division as a model for the type of approach it hopes will succeed across its portfolio. “Fabric care results demonstrate what is possible when we deliver superior value from best-in-class performance at a modest price premium,” CEO David Taylor told investors in August. “The U.S. laundry detergent market is continuing to grow behind our efforts, with the category up 4 [percentage] points last year.” Sampling will be a key focus going forward, as Taylor and his team plan to nearly double the number of free trial products its sends out this year — up to 30 million units. P&G also has plenty of promising innovations it can trumpet in its ramped-up advertising output, including an athletic-wear targeted Tide brand, new Tide Pods formulas, and Tide Pure Clean, which is focused on the small but growing niche of consumers demanding environment friendliness and sustainability in their detergents. Gillette P&G has had mixed results with its Gillette razor franchise. On the premium side of the business, particularly in the U.S., it has expanded market share with a new innovative Fusion lineup that was backed by huge marketing support. Thanks to successes like that, this division is easily P&G’s most profitable, responsible for 15% of earnings even though it only accounts for only 11% of net sales. Image source: Getty Images. The company hasn’t executed as well at the value end of the market. It has lost share to private label brands, and to the subscription approach taken by Dollar Shave Club. Now that global rival Unilever (NYSE: UL) owns that brand, P&G can only expect the competition to get more intense from here. The good news for investors is that management appears to understand the scope of the challenge. “We need to do more work on the lower end of the portfolio,” Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said recently, “and toto be more present in the direct-to-consumption e-commerce channels.” Overall, P&G has forecast a small but important growth uptick for fiscal 2017 that should see organic sales rise 2% after ticking up by just 1% last year. Investors can expect increasing cash returns and higher profitability regardless of whether that rebound continues. However, for P&G to get back on track for sustainable earnings gains, it will need to start posting market share growth in its biggest brands.

Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Nov 17, 2016 at 9:50AM Income investors love dividend stocks because they combine both current income and growth prospects. However, you can't just buy any dividend stock. Instead, you need the stocks with the most potential for future gains. Below, you'll find out how McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), Target (NYSE:TGT), and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) have not only managed to give investors yields of 3% or more but have also provided ongoing growth to longtime investors. Image source: McDonald's. McDonald's stays golden McDonald's has put together an impressive performance, both in terms of dividend growth and in total return. Over the past 45 years, the stock has produced average annual returns of more than 13%, and the fast-food giant has done so even in the midst of a transformation in the way that Americans eat. Despite the rise of fast-casual restaurants that have challenged the business model that McDonald's and its fast-food peers have followed for decades, the company known for its golden arches has taken steps to reach out to customers and meet their changing needs. Most recently, the move to offer all-day breakfast has led to renewed excitement about the company and the stock, and McDonald's hopes to keep moving forward with new momentum. McDonald's currently yields 3.2%, which is above the average for stocks in the Dow Jones Industrials. In addition, McDonald's has raised its annual dividend every year for 41 straight years, giving income investors the stability they want to see. Given its recent success, McDonald's looks like it has plenty of room to keep growing in the future. Aim for the Target Target is a well-known big-box department store retailer that has done a good job of finding a balance within its industry. Rather than simply seeking to cut prices as far as possible, Target has sought to justify slightly higher price points by making smart partnerships with various well-known outside suppliers, especially in the fashion industry. To a greater extent than most other retail giants, Target has exploited the power of exclusive branding opportunities to drive traffic and build a more upscale atmosphere in its stores than some of its closest rivals. Target's long-term vision has helped produce average annual returns of nearly 15% over the past 35 years. Target also carries a 3.2% yield, even after its recent run-up following an extremely strong earnings report. Moreover, Target's dividend history features 49 straight years of annual dividend increases, demonstrating its commitment to payout growth. Investors are hopeful that the holiday season will be good for Target, helping to add to its already impressive positive momentum. P&G covers the world Procter & Gamble is a consumer giant known the world over, with billion-dollar brands like Tide laundry detergent and Crest toothpaste. The company has given shareholders 12% average annual returns over the past 40 years, and the growth that P&G has forged in emerging markets has been a major driver of its long-term success. Even though rocky economic performance in some of its markets has eaten into its growth recently, Procter & Gamble is still poised to take advantage of longer-term trends toward a greater consumer presence across the globe. For dividend investors, one of Procter & Gamble's most attractive qualities is its 3.2% yield. A nearly unparalleled track record of 60 years of annual dividend increases doesn't hurt, either. Given just how much of a household name Procter & Gamble is the world over, the consumer products giant will have every opportunity to keep on selling the products that generate such impressive cash flow and dividend payments for its shareholders. If you look only at yield to the exclusion of all other factors, then you run the risk of buying stocks that don't have the growth prospects you want. Instead, the highest-quality dividend stocks will offer not only income but also share-price appreciation potential that can dramatically add to your total returns.

Drugmakers and other health care companies are taking the largest losses. Small-company stocks are at record highs and still rising. Bond yields are rising further and the dollar also continues to climb. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average slid 18 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,886 as of 3:23 p.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 3 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,183. The Nasdaq composite touched a record high, but turned lower and gave up 8 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,325. Despite those losses, stocks are substantially higher this week after their big gains the week before. SMALL CAPS GO BIG: Small-company stocks continued to gain and the Russell 2000 index bucked the overall downward trend in the market. That index has risen for 11 days in a row, a streak that dates to before the election. It's up 13 percent over that time and is trading at all-time highs. Among small-company stocks, mortgage lending service company LendingTree added $6.85, or 7.3 percent, to $100.05 and coal miner Cloud Peak Energy rose 80 cents, or 16.1 percent, to $5.80. THE QUOTE: "Some of the proposals that Trump has promoted, specifically deregulation and also some of his trade proposals, are better for small companies than potentially they are for large ones," said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for Northern Trust. QUEASY FEELING: Losses for drug companies weighed down health care stocks. Botox maker Allergan retreated $6.53, or 3.3 percent, to $193.45 and biotech giant Amgen fell $1.80, or 1.2 percent, to $145.57. Hepatitis C drugmaker Gilead Sciences shed 97 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $74.61. HOME GOODS GO BAD: Companies that sell common household products are also moving lower. Procter & Gamble gave up 87 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $82.20 and drugstore operator Walgreens Boots Alliance slumped 65 cents to $83.33. RETAIL: Teen clothing company Abercrombie & Fitch fell $2.44, or 14.4 percent, to $14.49 after it reported weak sales and a smaller profit than analysts had expected. Gap's said fewer people visited its stores heading into the holiday season. Its stock gave up $5.03, or 16.4 percent, to $25.68. Sporting goods Hibbett Sports retailer cut its annual forecasts after a weak third-quarter report. It dropped $6.25, or 13.8 percent, to $39.05. Shoppers are not buying as many clothes and moving toward discount chains. That trend continued as discount retailer Ross Stores rose $2.50, or 3.8 percent, to $68.03 after it posted a better-than-expected profit and sales. DOLLAR SEEING GREEN: The dollar continued to climb. It's around annual highs against the euro and six-month highs against the yen. The dollar rose to 110.63 yen from 109.89 yen. The euro fell to $1.0599 from $1.0626. The dollar hasn't been this strong since early 2003. Nixon said that's affecting big multinational companies because it can hurt their sales outside the U.S., but it's less of a problem for smaller, domestically-oriented companies. BONDS: Investors continued to sell U.S. government bonds at a rapid clip, and bond prices wobbled and turned lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.34 percent from 2.30 percent. Bond prices have fallen hard since the election and yields are now at their highest in a year. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 27 cents to close at $45.69 a barrel in New York, while Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, added 37 cents to $46.86 a barrel in London. Energy companies made the biggest gains on the market. Chevron rose $1.31, or 1.2 percent, to $109.43 and ConocoPhillips jumped $1.25, or 2.9 percent, to $44.86. OUT IN FORCE: Customer management software maker Salesforce.com jumped after a solid quarterly report and strong guidance. Its stock picked up $2.44, or 3.2 percent, to $77.63. A MARVEL: Chip maker Marvell Technology disclosed much stronger sales than analysts expected and gave a surprising forecast for the current quarter. Its stock gained $1.36, or 10.2 percent, to $14.72. METALS: Gold fell $8.20 to $1,208.70 an ounce. Silver lost 15 cents to $16.62 an ounce. Copper dipped 2 cents to $2.47 a pound. OTHER ENERGY TRADING: Wholesale gasoline stayed at $1.34 a gallon. Heating oil picked up 1 cent to $1.46 a gallon. Natural gas climbed 14 cents, or 5.2 percent, to $2.84 per 1,000 cubic feet. OVERSEAS: France's CAC 40 fell 0.5 percent and the FTSE 100 in Britain dipped 0.3 percent. The German DAX lost 0.2 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.6 percent as the yen hit a six-month low, helping shares of the country's big exporters. South Korea's Kospi shed 0.3 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.4 percent.

By MARLEY JAY AP Markets Writer NEW YORK (AP) - Major U.S. stock indexes slipped Friday as drug companies dragged the market lower. Small-company stocks bucked the downward trend and continued to climb, and bond yields rose to their highest level in a year. Drugmakers like Merck and biotech company Amgen took some of the biggest losses Friday. Weak results from Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch hurt retailers as investors kept a close eye on the upcoming holiday season. Small companies including regional banks continued to make large gains. Those stocks have risen sharply since the presidential election last week and are now at record highs. "Some of the proposals that (President-elect Donald) Trump has promoted, specifically deregulation and also some of his trade proposals, are better for small companies than potentially they are for large ones," said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for Northern Trust. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 35.89 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,867.93. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 5.22 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,181.90. The Nasdaq composite touched a record high early on, but turned lower and gave up 12.46 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,321.51. That's not a big loss, but the major indexes hadn't fallen that much since before the presidential election. Still, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq finished substantially higher this week after their big gains the week before. But indexes of smaller companies, like the Russell 2000 and the S&P 600, did better. They are on 11-day winning streaks and have hit all-time highs. Among small-company stocks, mortgage lending service company LendingTree added $6.80, or 7.3 percent, to $100 and coal miner Cloud Peak Energy rose 79 cents, or 15.8 percent, to $5.79. Losses for drug companies weighed down health care stocks. Botox maker Allergan retreated $8.20, or 4.1 percent, to $191.78 and biotech giant Amgen fell $2.13, or 1.4 percent, to $145.23. Hepatitis C drugmaker Gilead Sciences shed 96 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $74.62. Drug company stocks are coming off their biggest weekly gain in two years. The stocks had been falling in the months leading up to the election because investors worried that under a Hillary Clinton presidency, the federal government would take steps to rein in drug prices. Those kinds of steps are less likely under a Trump presidency and a Republican-controlled Congress. The dollar continued to climb. It's near one-year highs against the euro and six-month highs against the yen. The dollar rose to 110.63 yen from 109.89 yen. The euro fell to $1.0599 from $1.0626. The dollar hasn't been this strong since early 2003. Nixon of Northern Trust said that's affecting big multinational companies because it can hurt their sales outside the U.S., but it's less of a problem for smaller, domestically-oriented companies. Investors continued to sell U.S. government bonds at a rapid clip, and bond prices wobbled and turned lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.34 percent from 2.30 percent. Bond prices have fallen hard since the election and yields are now at their highest in a year. Teen clothing company Abercrombie & Fitch plunged $2.33, or 13.8 percent, to $14.60 after it reported weak sales and a smaller profit than analysts had expected. Gap's said fewer people visited its stores heading into the holiday season. Its stock gave up $5.10, or 16.6 percent, to $25.61. Sporting goods Hibbett Sports retailer cut its annual forecasts after a weak third-quarter report. It dropped $4.90, or 10.8 percent, to $40.40. Shoppers are not buying as many clothes and moving toward discount chains. That trend continued as discount retailer Ross Stores rose $2.47, or 3.8 percent, to $68 after it posted a better-than-expected profit and sales. Companies that sell common household products are also moving lower. Procter & Gamble gave up $1.07, or 1.3 percent, to $82 and drugstore operator Walgreens Boots Alliance slumped 72 cents to $83.27. Those companies have fallen since the election as investors buy companies that could benefit more from faster economic growth. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 27 cents to close at $45.69 a barrel in New York, while Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, added 37 cents to $46.86 a barrel in London. Energy companies traded higher. Chevron rose $1.08, or 1 percent, to $109.20 and ConocoPhillips jumped $1.15, or 2.6 percent, to $44.76. Gold fell $8.20 to $1,208.70 an ounce. Silver lost 15 cents to $16.62 an ounce. Copper dipped 2 cents to $2.47 a pound. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline stayed at $1.34 a gallon. Heating oil picked up 1 cent to $1.46 a gallon. Natural gas climbed 14 cents, or 5.2 percent, to $2.84 per 1,000 cubic feet. France's CAC 40 fell 0.5 percent and the FTSE 100 in Britain dipped 0.3 percent. The German DAX lost 0.2 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.6 percent as the yen hit a six-month low, helping shares of the country's big exporters. South Korea's Kospi shed 0.3 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.4 percent. ____ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Japanese shares rose, Friday, Nov. 18, 2016, on the yen's weakness while other Asian benchmarks wobbled after Fed chair Janet Yellen signaled that policymakers intend to raise interest rates soon. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) NEW YORK, N.Y. - Major U.S. stock indexes slipped Friday as drug companies dragged the market lower. Small-company stocks bucked the downward trend and continued to climb, and bond yields rose to their highest level in a year. Drugmakers like Merck and biotech company Amgen took some of the biggest losses Friday. Weak results from Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch hurt retailers as investors kept a close eye on the upcoming holiday season. Small companies including regional banks continued to make large gains. Those stocks have risen sharply since the presidential election last week and are now at record highs. "Some of the proposals that (President-elect Donald) Trump has promoted, specifically deregulation and also some of his trade proposals, are better for small companies than potentially they are for large ones," said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for Northern Trust. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 35.89 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 18,867.93. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 5.22 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 2,181.90. The Nasdaq composite touched a record high early on, but turned lower and gave up 12.46 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 5,321.51. That's not a big loss, but the major indexes hadn't fallen that much since before the presidential election. Still, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq finished substantially higher this week after their big gains the week before. But indexes of smaller companies, like the Russell 2000 and the S&P 600, did better. They are on 11-day winning streaks and have hit all-time highs. Among small-company stocks, mortgage lending service company LendingTree added $6.80, or 7.3 per cent, to $100 and coal miner Cloud Peak Energy rose 79 cents, or 15.8 per cent, to $5.79. Losses for drug companies weighed down health care stocks. Botox maker Allergan retreated $8.20, or 4.1 per cent, to $191.78 and biotech giant Amgen fell $2.13, or 1.4 per cent, to $145.23. Hepatitis C drugmaker Gilead Sciences shed 96 cents, or 1.3 per cent, to $74.62. Drug company stocks are coming off their biggest weekly gain in two years. The stocks had been falling in the months leading up to the election because investors worried that under a Hillary Clinton presidency, the federal government would take steps to rein in drug prices. Those kinds of steps are less likely under a Trump presidency and a Republican-controlled Congress. The dollar continued to climb. It's near one-year highs against the euro and six-month highs against the yen. The dollar rose to 110.63 yen from 109.89 yen. The euro fell to $1.0599 from $1.0626. The dollar hasn't been this strong since early 2003. Nixon of Northern Trust said that's affecting big multinational companies because it can hurt their sales outside the U.S., but it's less of a problem for smaller, domestically-oriented companies. Investors continued to sell U.S. government bonds at a rapid clip, and bond prices wobbled and turned lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.34 per cent from 2.30 per cent. Bond prices have fallen hard since the election and yields are now at their highest in a year. Teen clothing company Abercrombie & Fitch plunged $2.33, or 13.8 per cent, to $14.60 after it reported weak sales and a smaller profit than analysts had expected. Gap's said fewer people visited its stores heading into the holiday season. Its stock gave up $5.10, or 16.6 per cent, to $25.61. Sporting goods Hibbett Sports retailer cut its annual forecasts after a weak third-quarter report. It dropped $4.90, or 10.8 per cent, to $40.40. Shoppers are not buying as many clothes and moving toward discount chains. That trend continued as discount retailer Ross Stores rose $2.47, or 3.8 per cent, to $68 after it posted a better-than-expected profit and sales. Companies that sell common household products are also moving lower. Procter & Gamble gave up $1.07, or 1.3 per cent, to $82 and drugstore operator Walgreens Boots Alliance slumped 72 cents to $83.27. Those companies have fallen since the election as investors buy companies that could benefit more from faster economic growth. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 27 cents to close at $45.69 a barrel in New York, while Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, added 37 cents to $46.86 a barrel in London. Energy companies traded higher. Chevron rose $1.08, or 1 per cent, to $109.20 and ConocoPhillips jumped $1.15, or 2.6 per cent, to $44.76. Gold fell $8.20 to $1,208.70 an ounce. Silver lost 15 cents to $16.62 an ounce. Copper dipped 2 cents to $2.47 a pound. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline stayed at $1.34 a gallon. Heating oil picked up 1 cent to $1.46 a gallon. Natural gas climbed 14 cents, or 5.2 per cent, to $2.84 per 1,000 cubic feet. France's CAC 40 fell 0.5 per cent and the FTSE 100 in Britain dipped 0.3 per cent. The German DAX lost 0.2 per cent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.6 per cent as the yen hit a six-month low, helping shares of the country's big exporters. South Korea's Kospi shed 0.3 per cent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.4 per cent. ____ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *       FILE - In this Oct. 7, 2016 file photo, a sign for Wall Street is carved into a building located near the New York Stock Exchange.

Yes No View Results  Loading ... @MedicineHatNews Follow Us By Marley Jay, The Associated Press on November 18, 2016. 00000 NEW YORK – U.S. stocks are slipping Friday as investors take a pause following some huge moves since last week’s presidential election. Drugmakers and other health care companies are taking the largest losses. Retailers Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch are dropping after they gave weak quarterly reports, while discount retailer Ross Stores is climbing. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average slid 37 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 18,867 as of 12:25 p.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 5 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 2,181. The Nasdaq composite touched a record high, but turned lower and gave up 13 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 5,321. The losses weren’t large, but they represented the biggest decline for stocks since Nov. 3. At that time, the market was enduring a nine-day slide. QUEASY FEELING: Losses for drug companies weighed down health care stocks. Botox maker Allergan retreated $3.92, or 2 per cent, to $196.07 and biotech giant Amgen fell $2.30, or 1.6 per cent, to $145.06. Hepatitis C drugmaker Gilead Sciences shed $1.29, or 1.7 per cent, to $74.29 and Merck lost 73 cents, or 1.2 per cent, to $61.97. HOME GOODS GO BAD: Companies that sell common household products are also moving lower. Procter & Gamble gave up $1.04, or 1.3 per cent, to $82.03 and drugstore operator Walgreens Boots Alliance slumped 98 cents, or 1.2 per cent, to $83.01. Those companies tend to pay hefty dividends, and those are less appealing to investors in times of higher inflation. FUN IN THE SUN: Investors approved the combination of electric car maker Tesla Motors and solar power company SolarCity. The deal, first proposed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk in June, has gotten a chilly reception on Wall Street. Analysts wondered why Tesla would want to take on SolarCity while it’s building a big battery factory in Nevada and also preparing to launch its first mass-market car, the Model 3, due out at the end of 2017. Shares of both companies dropped in the ensuing months. Tesla slumped $1.55 to $187.11 and SolarCity rose 19 cents to $20.59. RETAIL: Teen clothing company Abercrombie & Fitch fell $2.42, or 14.3 per cent, to $14.51 after it reported weak sales and a smaller profit than analysts had expected. Gap’s said fewer people visited its stores heading into the holiday season. Its stock gave up $4.93, or 16.1 per cent, to $25.78. Sporting goods Hibbett Sports retailer cut its annual forecasts after a weak third-quarter report. It dropped $5.40, or 11.9 per cent, to $39.90. Shoppers are not buying as many clothes and moving toward discount chains. That trend continued as discount retailer Ross Stores rose $2.89, or 4.4 per cent, to $68.42 after it posted a better-than-expected profit and sales. DOLLAR SEEING GREEN: Already at its highest mark since early 2003, the dollar continued to climb. It’s around annual highs against the euro and six-month highs against the yen. The dollar rose to 110.51 yen from 109.89 yen. The euro fell to $1.0592 from $1.0626. BONDS: Investors continued to sell U.S. government bonds at a rapid clip, and bond prices wobbled and turned lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.33 per cent from 2.30 per cent. Bond prices have fallen hard since the election and yields are now at their highest in a year. OUT IN FORCE: Customer management software maker Salesforce.com jumped after a solid quarterly report and strong guidance. Its stock picked up $2.49, or 3.3 per cent, to $77.68. A MARVEL: Chipmaker Marvell Technology disclosed much stronger sales than analysts expected and gave a surprising forecast for the current quarter. Its stock gained $1.19, or 8.9 per cent, to $14.55. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude gave up 30 cents at $45.12 a barrel in New York, while Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, slid 25 cents to $46.24 a barrel in London. OVERSEAS: France’s CAC 40 fell 0.5 per cent and the FTSE 100 in Britain dipped 0.3 per cent. The German DAX lost 0.2 per cent. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.6 per cent as the yen hit a six-month low, helping shares of the country’s big exporters. South Korea’s Kospi shed 0.3 per cent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.4 per cent. ____ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay 00000 Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

The Nasdaq fell 0.23 percent after hitting an intraday record of 5,346.8 earlier in the session. The S&P 500 slipped 0.24 percent, with health care falling around 1 percent to lead decliners.  U.S. crude oil futures fell 0.59 percent to settle at $45.69 a barrel after Baker Hughes said U.S. oil rigs increased by 19 to 471.  Entering Friday's session, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite were all within half a percent of their previous all-time highs. The Dow had reached a record intraday high of 18,934.05 on Monday — on the back of a sharp post-election rally — while the S&P last set a record high of 2,193.81 on Aug. 15. All three indexes posted weekly gains, with the Nasdaq outperforming, up more than 1.7 percent. The small-cap Russell 2000 registered its longest win streak since a 12-session advance that lasted from May 20 to June 5, 2003.  Several Fed officials spoke Friday, including Kansas City Fed President Esther George. In a speech, she said the U.S. economy would benefit from the Federal Reserve raising rates sooner rather than later. Earlier, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he is leaning towards supporting a rate hike next month and argued on Friday that the real question now is the Fed's rate path in 2017. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, told CNBC in an email that Bullard also said "inflation needs to be above their target to speed hikes. Basically, what he is saying is that the future path of rate hike may not be that steep." Dallas Fed Bank President Robert Kaplan on Friday reiterated that he thinks it is nearly time for the U.S. central bank to raise interest rates. "I think, and I've been saying, we're at the point where we're ready to remove some accommodation in the near future," Kaplan said in a television interview with Fox Business Network. "I still feel that way heading into December." Bullard's and Kaplan's remarks followed Fed Chair Janet Yellen's testimony in Congress on Thursday, which all but assured the central bank would raise interest rates next month. According to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, market expectations for a rate hike in December were above 90 percent Friday morning. "Nothing in Janet Yellen's testimony to Congress on Thursday suggests anything different. Hence, monetary policy for the short term remains extremely transparent to source a stiff tailwind at the back of stocks. The looming specter of the central bank tightening next month should not disturb a Santa Claus rally that has already commenced," said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities, said in a note. Yellen's hawkish remarks sent the dollar index to its highest level in nearly 14 years, while U.S. Treasury yields held near recent highs. The U.S. dollar index traded higher on Friday, above 101. The euro was near $1.06 and the yen at 110.7 yen versus the greenback. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was up near 2.34 percent, and the 2-year yield was around 1.05 percent.  Overseas, the Chinese yuan hit a fresh eight-year low. The Nikkei 225 closed about 0.6 percent higher, while the Shanghai composite closed about half a percent lower. The Hang Seng climbed more than a third of a percent. In Europe, the German DAX traded slightly lower while the Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.36 percent. Decliners were a step ahead of advancers at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 510 million and a composite volume of 2.345 billion in afternoon ET. The CBOE Volatility index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded slightly lower, near 13.2.

Ozone Park Senior Recruited to West Point 17th November 2016 The Forum News 0 Comments Photo Courtesy of  Zurita Family Flanked by fellow Poly Prep classmates on College Signing Day, Travis Zurita (c) sports the West Point cap as parents Mario and Ginza watch over their  son. By Patricia Adams Three United States presidents, 74 Medal of Honor recipients, 18 astronauts five of whom have been to the moon, 70 Rhodes Scholars, 3 Heisman Trophy winners, 3 foreign heads of state, 34 Generals of major U.S. wars, the founder of AOL, and the CEO’s of Proctor & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson. And now, 17-year-old Ozone Park native Travis Zurita, has the chance to study inside the same halls that have produced many who have and who continue to shape the greatness of our country. One conversation with the SS/center fielder from the ozone Howard Little league and there’s really no confusion as to why West Point wants him on their roster. The former honor roll student at MS 202 currently studies at Poly Prep and is now completing the rigourous application process to attend the service academy that has produced so many remarkable graduates. The second child of his Ecuadorian-Puerto Rican parents, Travis looks up to his older brother Gonzalo and watches over his younger sister, Caitlyn, whom he refers to as “My Queen.” He is described by his parents Mario and Ginza as a boy who, despite all he attention brought his way remains forever humble. Much of the attention focused on Travis centers around his talent on the baseball diamond, which is the source of his scholarship opportunity at West Point. And although he hopes to catch the eyes of NY Yankee scouts one day he is prepared to take whatever the future holds. “If I don’t get drafted I will still emerge as a young man prepared to succeed in whatever the future holds.” Travis attributes his accomplishments to hard work, the support of his family and guidance he received from an early age from Ozone Howard coach Joe Bode. “Coach Joe has been there every step of the way for me. No matter what I need, he’s there. He’s been like another father figure to me.” Now as he prepares for a June graduation and a July departure for boot camp, Travis says the most difficult thing he faces is the separation from his family. “It’s going to be a heartbreaker for me, but in the end I know it will all work out for the best.” Although leaving everything he knows and cherishes will be a challenge, the young man with humble roots seems to already have developed a strong sense of family, responsibility, ambition and love of country. Asked what advice he has for his peers to succeed, he offers these words:” If you just keep working hard, you’re guaranteed to have somethng good come to you. Guranteed.” Article Written By The Forum Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Credit: CUMP Ad Age's second annual Women to Watch Mexico event honored 15 outstanding women in marketing, advertising and media at a luncheon Nov. 14 at Club 51, on the 51st floor of the Torre Mayor, the third-tallest building in Mexico City. The event was organized by Adlatina, Ad Age's partner in Spanish-speaking Latin America. This year's honorees, who spoke at the luncheon attended by almost 200 people, are leading change in a fast-moving world. Liliana Inigo Elias brought a wealth of experience to Citibanamex when she joined as chief marketing officer four months ago. She started in packaged goods at Procter & Gamble and then Nestle, became the marketing head for a number of Walmart businesses in Mexico, then entered financial services at MasterCard. "The speed of retail is one of the most important things I learned," she told Ad Age. She oversaw the rebranding of Mexican bank Banamex as Citibanamex in October, and is involved in Citi's transformation to digital banking, opening three digital branches in October, with more to come. Paula Figueroa, Flock - Linked by Isobar.

She became a digital specialist just two years ago, after developing a longtime interest in social media and joining Flock last year, shortly before the independent digital shop was acquired by Dentsu Aegis Network. "I arrived with humility to say I don't know everything, but understand the integration of ideas," Ms. Figueroa told Ad Age. "Clients started to see us as not just a digital agency but as an integrated one." Other agency honorees include Rocio Elizondo, an entrepreneur who brought Havas Health to Mexico, and Marta Ruiz-Cuevas, chosen to bring together all Publicis Groupe's media brands in Mexico under the new Publicis Media. "We moved 500 people in a month," Ms. Ruiz-Cuevas told Ad Age. Honorees Liliana Inigo Elias, Rocio Elizondo, Paola Figueroa and Marta Ruiz-Cuevas. Credit: CUMP Publicis Media team.

Lourdes Berho, who became CEO of the Mexico Tourism board this year at the invitation of Mexico's tourism minister, said she is restructuring the country's international campaigns, based on a recent segmentation study in North America that found that 18 million people were interested in traveling to places like Mexico. "We'll identify what drives them to travel and what distribution channels we need to use," she said. A similar segmentation model is coming up for Europe. Honoree Xiomara Martin Matos, from Unilever, with her family. Credit: CUMP Known for mining strategies for both brands and buyers of Unilever's products as consumer marketing insights director, Xiomara Martin Matos is responsible for 15 categories in 15 countries in Latin America. She was one of several honorees to allude to the recent U.S. elections, saying that "a door has opened to hatred and validating sexism." She said three things are clear: "Believe in ourselves; have clear objectives; and unite, not just as women, but as Mexico." Alejandra Villarreal, a Unilever and Danone veteran, joined Henkel a year ago as director of marketing, for laundry products such as detergent brand Persil and homecare in Latin America, which includes markets like Guatemala, where she says many women still wash clothes by hand. She works with Greenpeace and children's groups such as UNICEF and her job at Henkel, which she says takes corporate responsibility seriously, aligns with her core values. "In Latin America, it doesn't matter if you have the resources, you are resourceful," she said. Google's Olga San Jacinto (center) with daughter Sofia (left), and Alejandra Villarreal, of Henkel.

Olga San Jacinto brought her 13-year-old daughter Sofia, with whom she made a joint decision to move to Mexico two years ago for Google, after working with Google Maps in New York and earlier being part of Google's initial launch team in Europe. In Mexico, her role is to accelerate revenue growth, including mobile. "That includes helping Mexican companies to sell in other countries digitally without opening physical stores," she told Ad Age. Esperansita Bejnarowicz's mother and sister flew to Mexico City from Toronto for the event. Ms. Bejnarowicz, a Canadian, moved to Mexico from Detroit six years ago to introduce digital initiatives for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Mexico and now oversees all advertising for the company's seven brands.

If you're ready, you use the energy to hit back harder." Another honoree from the auto industry, Ana Paulina Velazquez, was hired away from Renault last year to help launch the Kia brand, a latecomer to Mexico, and has already been promoted.

Maria Teresa "Mariate" Arnal, who was leading digital transformation as CEO of JWT Mexico, joined Twitter in September as director general for Spanish-speaking Latin America. Former Saatchi & Saatchi CEO Analu Solano has been general manager of Cheil Mexico for the past three months. Regional Coca-Cola Co. creativity and content exec Marta Fontcuberta has been promoted to a global Coke role in Atlanta, and Magdalena Ferreira Lamas has gone from VP-marketing at Avon to general manager. Laura Tapia, director of marketing capabilities for Latin America, has left P&G to be a consultant. And Carolina Arana, a former swimmer, took very early retirement from Kellogg to run and grow three swimming schools she started with her husband. Up next, starting Dec. 1, agency veteran Lourdes Lamasney is leaving Richards Lerma Mexico to work on the client side for the first time, as global marketing manager at Grupo Bimbo. Women to Watch Mexico caps Ad Age's 2016 Women to Watch program, following the launch of Women to Watch Europe in London, and new classes of honorees at events in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, the U.S., and last week in Turkey. The 10 honorees in Istanbul at Women to Watch Turkey, organized by Ad Age's local partner MediaCat, were from Google, L'Oreal, MullenLowe Istanbul, Unilever, Wanda Digital, local agencies Rafineri and DirectComm and local companies Opet, Betek Group and Yasa Holding.

Here's Why Everybody's Talking About It COMPANY OF THE YEAR Inside Dollar Shave Club's Billion-Dollar Payday Dollar razors are just the beginning for this upstart shaving company. By Guadalupe Gonzalez Guadalupe Gonzalez is a Mexican journalist who is currently pursuing an MA in magazine writing at New York University. She previously worked in media relations for Femsa, a multinational company with businesses in the beverage, beer, and retail industries. Her focus lies on politics, business, media, and innovation. @mariainnyc Editorial intern@mariainnyc WRITE A COMMENT Michael Dubin, founder and CEO of Dollar Shave Club. CREDIT: Jeff Minton Advertisement Editor's Note: Inc. magazine will announce its pick for Company of the Year on Tuesday, November 29. Here, we spotlight Dollar Shave Club, one of the contenders for the title in 2016. If imitation is the highest form of flattery, Michael Dubin must be feeling good right about now. Since he launched Dollar Shave Club in 2011, at least nine other shaving-related subscription services have sprouted up. There's Harry's, started by two of the co-founders of Warby Parker; Tristan Walker's Bevel, which sells grooming products for African Americans; and Wet Shave Club, which boasts an old-school shave with its monthly box. Some other subscription services include Brickell, which specializes in organic and antiaging products; and BirchBox for men, Luxury Barber, Morgans, and Dollar Beard Club, which are focused on helping men grow their beards. And then there's Gillette Shave Club from Procter & Gamble. The consumer products giant launched its shaving subscription service in 2015. "I saw Gillette's move as validation both that we were on the right track and that we were having a major impact," says Dubin, whose Venice, California-based company first gained notoriety in 2012, after its video, "Our Blades Are F***ing Great," went supernova viral in 72 hours. What was even more validating? In July, Unilever agreed to shell out a whopping $1 billion for Dubin's company, which isn't yet profitable but reported sales of $152 million last year. Behind the payday. While snapping up Dollar Shave helps Unilever join the shaving party--and cut into its rival Gillette's market share--analysts suggest that there's more to the story. Specifically, Dollar Shave, with its more than 3.2 million subscribers, presents a treasure trove of data for the London-based consumer products maker. "They have a pretty comprehensive data bank now about the grooming habits of the American male, particularly that key 18-to-29 demographic," says Matthew Barry, an analyst at market research firm Euromonitor. Andy Hoar, analyst at Forrester Research, adds that Dollar Shave's marketing prowess is something Unilever will surely tap. To date, the company's first viral video has logged over 23.6 million views. "The most important thing in today's economy is customer attention, and if you got, it you can sell people a lot of things," says Hoar. Dubin's just happy to forget about fundraising and focus on Dollar Shave Club's next chapter. "We just started to scratch the surface on the things we want to do," he says, noting that the company will continue to operate independently. "Dollar Shave Club didn't get to be what it is because Unilever was telling us what to do or how to do it," says the 37-year-old entrepreneur. "They want to preserve the magic." Preserving the magic. So what, pray tell, is next? The four-year-old company is on its way to becoming a lifestyle brand, says Rick Prostko, managing director at Comcast Ventures and one of Dollar Shave Club's early investors. "You could see that there was a movement building here and a community forming around this brand," he says. "It's much more than just razors." Barry agrees: "Razors aren't profitable for them. You can't make money selling razors for a dollar a month. That's just not a sustainable business model," he says. He argues that the razors act as a lure; they bring in customers who add other items to their order, like bath or skin care products. And because you have a direct line to their feedback, you have a pretty good idea of what they want and look for. Still, Dubin isn't giving many hints at what's to come--other than to refer to some degree of product expansion. In 2016, the company rolled out Big Cloud and Wanderer, two new product lines focusing on skin care and shower products, respectively. Members also get service-style content by way of Bathroom Minutes, a small magazine included in the monthly subscription box. It has also been growing its original content department, including a podcast and the newly launched Mel Magazine, which has a separate website and social media channels. Not even Prostko knows what's on the agenda at the company. But he's not worried. "I'm constantly surprised by Michael's innate ability to put his finger on where the market needs to go," he says.

The Nasdaq was down in the afternoon, after hitting an intraday record high earlier, with the biggest drags from companies such as Alphabet Inc and Amgen. U.S. stocks have generally been rising since Donald Trump's surprise victory in the presidential election last week as his proposals to increase infrastructure spending and reduce taxes are expected to boost the economy. While the three major indexes were on track to close higher for the second week in a row, the rally lost some steam this week. "People are still trying to wrap their arms around what the U.S. elections mean for policy going forward," said Jason Pride, director of investment strategy at Glenmede in Philadelphia. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 33.73 points, or 0.18 percent, at 18,870.09, the S&P 500 lost 4.91 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,182.21. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 10.58 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,323.40 after hitting a record of 5346.8. Seven of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower. Losses in shares of Merck and Allergan Plc helped drag down the S&P health sector, which led the decliners with a 1.2 percent fall. Consumer staples fell 0.4 percent, weighed down by a 1 percent fall in Procter & Gamble. The S&P Energy sector was the best performer with a 0.7 percent increase as oil futures rose. The S&P financial sector was up 0.2 percent, and has risen almost 11 percent since the U.S. election, boosted by prospect of higher interest rates and lighter regulation. Traders are pricing in an 83-percent chance for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December, according to Thomson Reuters data. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said Friday he was leaning toward supporting a December increase and that the real question would be the Fed's rate path in 2017. Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Esther George said that while she supports raising rates, the U.S. central bank must do so only gradually. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen had said Thursday the central bank could raise rates "relatively soon," sending out a clear signal for a December move. Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch each fell more than 14 percent after both retailers warned of a challenging holiday quarter. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.12-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 32 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 216 new highs and 25 new lows.

Drugmaker losses pull stocks lower; small-cap surge goes on Associated Press | NEW YORK (AP) — Major U.S. stock indexes slipped Friday as drug companies dragged the market lower. Small-company stocks bucked the downward trend and continued to climb, and bond yields rose to their highest level in a year. Drugmakers like Merck and biotech company Amgen took some of the biggest losses Friday. Weak results from Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch hurt retailers as investors kept a close eye on the upcoming holiday season. Small companies including regional banks continued to make large gains. Those stocks have risen sharply since the presidential election last week and are now at record highs. "Some of the proposals that (President-elect Donald) Trump has promoted, specifically deregulation and also some of his trade proposals, are better for small companies than potentially they are for large ones," said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for Northern Trust. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 35.89 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,867.93. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 5.22 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,181.90. The Nasdaq composite touched a record high early on, but turned lower and gave up 12.46 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,321.51. That's not a big loss, but the major indexes hadn't fallen that much since before the presidential election. Still, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq finished substantially higher this week after their big gains the week before. But indexes of smaller companies, like the Russell 2000 and the S&P 600, did better. They are on 11-day winning streaks and have hit all-time highs. Among small-company stocks, mortgage lending service company LendingTree added $6.80, or 7.3 percent, to $100 and coal miner Cloud Peak Energy rose 79 cents, or 15.8 percent, to $5.79. Losses for drug companies weighed down health care stocks. Botox maker Allergan retreated $8.20, or 4.1 percent, to $191.78 and biotech giant Amgen fell $2.13, or 1.4 percent, to $145.23. Hepatitis C drugmaker Gilead Sciences shed 96 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $74.62. Drug company stocks are coming off their biggest weekly gain in two years. The stocks had been falling in the months leading up to the election because investors worried that under a Hillary Clinton presidency, the federal government would take steps to rein in drug prices. Those kinds of steps are less likely under a Trump presidency and a Republican-controlled Congress. The dollar continued to climb. It's near one-year highs against the euro and six-month highs against the yen. The dollar rose to 110.63 yen from 109.89 yen. The euro fell to $1.0599 from $1.0626. The dollar hasn't been this strong since early 2003. Nixon of Northern Trust said that's affecting big multinational companies because it can hurt their sales outside the U.S., but it's less of a problem for smaller, domestically-oriented companies. Investors continued to sell U.S. government bonds at a rapid clip, and bond prices wobbled and turned lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.34 percent from 2.30 percent. Bond prices have fallen hard since the election and yields are now at their highest in a year. Teen clothing company Abercrombie & Fitch plunged $2.33, or 13.8 percent, to $14.60 after it reported weak sales and a smaller profit than analysts had expected. Gap's said fewer people visited its stores heading into the holiday season. Its stock gave up $5.10, or 16.6 percent, to $25.61. Sporting goods Hibbett Sports retailer cut its annual forecasts after a weak third-quarter report. It dropped $4.90, or 10.8 percent, to $40.40. Shoppers are not buying as many clothes and moving toward discount chains. That trend continued as discount retailer Ross Stores rose $2.47, or 3.8 percent, to $68 after it posted a better-than-expected profit and sales. Companies that sell common household products are also moving lower. Procter & Gamble gave up $1.07, or 1.3 percent, to $82 and drugstore operator Walgreens Boots Alliance slumped 72 cents to $83.27. Those companies have fallen since the election as investors buy companies that could benefit more from faster economic growth. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 27 cents to close at $45.69 a barrel in New York, while Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, added 37 cents to $46.86 a barrel in London. Energy companies traded higher. Chevron rose $1.08, or 1 percent, to $109.20 and ConocoPhillips jumped $1.15, or 2.6 percent, to $44.76. Gold fell $8.20 to $1,208.70 an ounce. Silver lost 15 cents to $16.62 an ounce. Copper dipped 2 cents to $2.47 a pound. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline stayed at $1.34 a gallon. Heating oil picked up 1 cent to $1.46 a gallon. Natural gas climbed 14 cents, or 5.2 percent, to $2.84 per 1,000 cubic feet. France's CAC 40 fell 0.5 percent and the FTSE 100 in Britain dipped 0.3 percent. The German DAX lost 0.2 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.6 percent as the yen hit a six-month low, helping shares of the country's big exporters. South Korea's Kospi shed 0.3 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.4 percent. ____ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay © 2016 The Associated Press.

Posted 18 Nov 2016 21:50 Updated 19 Nov 2016 06:10 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., November 10, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: U.S. stocks ended lower on Friday, with healthcare stocks leading the declines, as investors cashed in on a post-election rally and waited for clarity on the next administration's policies. Wall Street equities took a breather after rising dramatically since Donald Trump's surprise victory in the presidential election last week. While the three major indexes closed higher for the second week in a row, the rally lost some steam this week as investors awaited more information to support their bets that Trump could succeed in passing proposals to lift infrastructure spending and reduce taxes. "I see the market kind of churning here because it's had a very decent move," said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York. "Trump's policies continue to be just rhetoric because none of it has been enacted." The Dow Jones industrial average fell 35.89 points, or 0.19 percent, to 18,867.93 while the S&P 500 dropped 5.22 points, or 0.24 percent, to 2,181.9. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 12.46 points, or 0.23 percent, to 5,321.51 after hitting a record of 5346.8. The Nasdaq's biggest drags came from technology companies such as Alphabet Inc and drug firms including Amgen . Six of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors closed lower. Losses in shares of Allergan Plc and Merck were the biggest drags on the S&P health sector , which led the decliners. The health index pared its post-election lift but was still 1.8 percent higher than Nov. 8, even after Friday's drop of 1.2 percent. Only five of the indexes stocks ended higher. Consumer staples fell 0.4 percent, weighed down by a 1.3 percent fall in Procter & Gamble . The S&P Energy sector was the second best performer with a 0.5 percent increase as producers added to rig count, suggesting that they might be expecting a demand boost, Polarci said. Traders are pricing in an 83 percent chance for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December, according to Thomson Reuters data. The S&P financial sector ended up 0.08 percent, and has risen 10.8 percent since the U.S. election, boosted by prospect of higher interest rates and lighter regulation. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said Friday he was leaning toward supporting a December increase and that the real question would be the Fed's rate path in 2017. Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Esther George said that while she supports raising rates, the U.S. central bank must do so only gradually. The comments added to Fed Chair Janet Yellen's Thursday statement that the rate hike could come "relatively soon." Gap fell 16.6 percent and Abercrombie & Fitch fell 13.8 percent. Both retailers warned of a challenging holiday quarter. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.18-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 32 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 253 new highs and 30 new lows. About 6.69 billion shares changed hands U.S. exchanges, well below the 8.02 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

Japanese shares rose, Friday, Nov. 18, 2016, on the yen's weakness while other Asian benchmarks wobbled after Fed chair Janet Yellen signaled that policymakers intend to raise interest rates soon. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) Updated at 3:15 p.m. U.S. stocks ended lower on Friday, with healthcare stocks leading the declines as investors cashed in on a post-election rally and waited for clarity on the next U.S. administration's policies. Based on the latest available data, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 35.68 points, or 0.19 percent, to 18,868.14, the S&P 500 had lost 5.17 points, or 0.24 percent, to 2,181.95 and the Nasdaq Composite had dropped 12.46 points, or 0.23 percent, to 5,321.51. Our earlier story:  U.S. stocks were lower in early afternoon trading on Friday as health stocks weighed and investors cashed in after the post-election rally, but the three major indexes continued to hover near record levels. The Nasdaq hit a record high earlier in the session, helped by a rise in Microsoft and other big tech stocks. Losses in shares of Merck and Johnson and Johnson dragged down the S&P health sector, which led the decliners with a 1.08 percent fall. U.S. stocks had been on a tear since Donald Trump's surprise victory in the presidential election last week as his proposals to increase infrastructure spending and reduce taxes are seen benefiting the economy. The rally lost steam this week as investors took to the sidelines, awaiting more clarity regarding Trump's policies. Still, the three major indexes are on track to close higher for the second week in a row. "I think given the major indexes are at or near all-time highs, we're probably due for a little bit of a digestion period," said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. "Equities are generally expected to move sideways until we get a little more of visibility into what some of the policies are going to be with the new administration." Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said on Thursday the central bank could raise interest rates "relatively soon," sending out a clear signal for a December move. Traders are pricing in an 83 percent chance of a December move, according to Thomson Reuters data. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he was leaning toward supporting an interest rate increase in December and that the real question now would be the Fed's rate path in 2017. Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Esther George also said that while she supports raising interest rates, the U.S. central bank must do so only gradually.

The S&P 500 was down 5.11 points, or 0.23 percent, at 2,182.01. The index hit a record high of 2,193.81 on Aug. 15. The Nasdaq Composite was down 12.70 points, or 0.24 percent, at 5,321.28. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower. Consumer Staples fell 0.45 percent, weighed down by a 1.1 percent fall in Procter & Gamble. Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch fell more than 10 percent after both retailers warned of a challenging holiday quarter. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,589 to 1,302. On the Nasdaq, 1,446 issues fell and 1,292 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 31 new 52-week highs and four new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 184 new highs and 22 new lows.

CBS is clearly hoping that lightning strikes twice with The Dick Van Dyke Show – Now in Living Color! TV special after years of successful programming of re-airing episodes of I Love Lucy. Last year the network gave The Andy Griffith Show the same treatment, but it didn’t have the same success that the Lucy specials have had each year. Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke in “That’s My Boy?” [Image by CBS] The Dick Van Dyke Show special will feature two of the show’s most popular episodes. The first half of the hour will feature the 1963 episode “That’s My Boy?” where Rob and Laura Petrie (Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore) reminisce about years earlier when they had thought they had brought home the wrong baby from the hospital. Then, the second half of the new special will feature 1965’s award-winning episode “Coast to Coast Big Mouth” where Laura accidentally blurts out on national TV that Rob’s boss and host of the fictional Alan Brady Show wears a toupee. “Coast to Coast Big Mouth” ranked No. 8 on TV Guide’s list of the “100 Greatest TV Episodes of All Time” and won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series in 1966. The new special will air on December 10, Sunday, at 8:00 p.m. a week after CBS’ traditional airing of the I Love Lucy Christmas Special, which airs on Friday, December 2, also at 8:00 p.m. Carl Reiner, who played the role of Alan Brady on the show, personally oversaw the colorization of the two episodes. Carl Reiner played Alan Brady on “The Dick Van Dyke Show.” [Image by CBS] The Dick Van Dyke Show originally aired on CBS from October 3, 1961, through June 1, 1966, and was filmed at Desilu Studios, which was owned by Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. The show starred Van Dyke as Rob Petrie, Mary Tyler Moore as his wife Laura, Larry Mathews as their son Richie, Morey Amsterdam as the office clown Maurice “Buddy” Sorrell, Rose Marie as Sally Rogers, Richard Deacon as office manager and worry wort Melvin Cooley, Ann Morgan Guilbert as neighbor Millie Helper, and Jerry Paris as Millie’s husband Jerry. Though Van Dyke was considered the star of the show, it was in fact a classic ensemble show. The Dick Van Dyke Show wasn’t as successful as I Love Lucy at first and it failed to make it to the Top 30 in the Nielsen ratings in its first year, but people knew that the show had potential. CBS had intended to cancel the series after its initial run, but Procter & Gamble saved the day by threatening to pull all of the company’s advertising from CBS. After a summer of reruns of the series, the show made it into the top 10 by the third episode of the second season of the following year which was helped by the show’s new lead in, The Beverly Hillbillies.

Here practitioners hear from experts, discuss current trends and learn about new technology. The main theme was keeping medicines safe. The event was held at a hotel in Nottingham (the Belfry) and it was the 24th conference held by the Pharmaceutical Microbiology Interest Group (Pharmig.) Pharmig stand at the conference, putting forward new ideas for pharmaceutical microbiology. Tim Sandle The conference opened with an address by a representative of the U.K.'s pharmaceutical products regulator (the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency — MHRA). The presentation was delivered by Andrew Hopkins. The focus was on the forthcoming revision to the guidance for the manufacture of sterile pharmaceutical products. Such products are generally administered to very ill people, who often have weak or compromised immune systems. MHRA presentation at the November 2016 Pharmig conference, covering sterile products updates. Tim Sandle The second presentation of the first day was on the subject of data integrity. This largely concerns computer systems, such as systems used for recording the results of laboratory assays (and where the results contribute to the overall assessment of whether a drug product is both safe and efficacious). This was delivered by Julie Roberts, a pharmaceutical consultant. In some regions of the world fraudulent practices have taken place where data has been changed, and this has led to an increased focus from regulatory bodies (such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration). Unintentional compromises to data can also occur through system data losses. The next presentation was delivered by U.S.-based microbiologist Dr. Tony Cundell. Dr. Cundell, who sits on the microbiology working group for the United States Pharmacopoeia, looked at the safeguards around pharmaceutical compounding. In recent years, compounding centers have been hit by various quality issues, including the need for product recalls due to microbial contamination issues. The most infamous of these was the New England Compounding Center, where a fungal contamination incident of a sterile injection product intended to treat arthritis led to the deaths of 64 people and caused life-changing injuries to over 700 more. This incident was extensively covered by Digital Journal. Dr. Cundell explained that while progress had been made, greater vigilance was required. Dr. Cindell presenting at the 2016 Pharmig conference. Tim Sandle The fourth presentation was on advances in laboratory technology in the form of rapid microbiological methods. This was delivered by Dr. Paul Newby of GlaxoSmithKline. Rapid microbiological method technologies aim to provide more sensitive, accurate, precise and reproducible test results when compared with conventional, growth-based methods. Rapid methods normally involve some form of automation, and the methods often capture data electronically. The fifth presentation, by Dr. Kevin Wright (Procter & Gamble), considered how methods can be transferred between different laboratories without any technical hitches. The sixth, and final presentation of the first day, was a case study from Public Health England. Here Dr. Bharat Patel gave the background into a series of deaths of newborn babies in Northern Ireland in 2011-2012. The cause was due to a bacterium called Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the organism had colonized the water systems of several hospitals in Belfast. The case study included some important lessons to be learned. Delegates examining the exhibition hall at the Pharmig 2016 conference. Tim Sandle Inter-spaced between the presentations were workshops. The subjects included data integrity, where Julie Roberts built upon her presentation; improving cleaning and disinfection practices, hosted by Laura Guardi and Rachel Blount; and an expert corner, run by Andy Martin and Andy Brack. An additional session was held by this writer on the quality of culture media. Culture media is of fundamental importance for most microbiological tests: to obtain pure cultures, to grow and count microbial cells, and to cultivate and select microorganisms. Without high-quality media, the possibility of achieving accurate, reproducible, and repeatable microbiological test results is reduced. The following day of the conference was opened by a second lecture from Dr. Cundell. This concerned the safe testing of non-sterile pharmaceutical products (such as an inhaler or tablet.) Some sound advice for screening for so-called 'objectionable' microorganisms was offered. The second presentation of day two was from Laura Guardi, who works for the global company AstraZeneca. This provided some best practice guidance on the validation of disinfectants. Keeping the environment within which pharmaceutical products are manufactured in control, and with a low level of microorganisms, is critical to product quality and this can be achieved through the use of appropriate disinfectants. To know whether a disinfectant is suitable requires validation. Visitors and exhibitors meet to discuss new innovations at Pharmig 2016. Tim Sandle This was followed by a presentation by Dr. Anna Lovatt on the selection of microbial identification systems and the appropriate strategy for characterizing microbial contamination. Characterizing a microorganism can provide important information as to its origin and potential impact in relation to a product or in relation to the environment in which it was isolated. The penultimate presentation of the conference was delivered by Edel Fitzmaurice, a consultant microbiologist based in Ireland. This looked at the optimal means for designing risk assessment for the safe production of pharmaceutical products. The conference closed with a lecture by Peter Gough (of the company NSF) on the impact of Brexit on the U.K. pharmaceutical industry. Here the outcome remains uncertain. A closing presentation by Edel Fitzmaurice on the application of risk assessment tools and techniques. Tim Sandle The conference succeeded in emphasizing the importance of risk assessment to keep pharmaceutical medicines safe from microbial contamination and the need to embrace the latest techniques and technologies in order to make this happen.

However, given that this was created from an executive order, will Donald Trump remove it given his promise to “cancel immediately all illegal and overreaching executive orders”? John Jediny, the Chief Data Engineer at Data.gov, is to speak at the Chief Data Officer Summit in New York on December 7 & 8, less than 30 days after Donald Trump’s election. John will be discussing what has been achieved by Data.gov since its inception and also what the future could hold for open data in the US government. The summit comes at a time when the use of data within government has grown over the past 8 years, with President Obama appointing the first Chief Data Officer at the White House, but it is unclear what Donald Trump’s approach will be. In May 2016 Trump said of data “I've always felt it was overrated,” which is likely to have put several data-driven government departments on alert. Since the inception of the Data.gov US citizens have been given the opportunity to do things like compare college costs, search data to promote fair housing policy, find out the safety of hospitals and make decisions on schooling through open data initiatives. It has become one of the biggest successes of the Obama administration and has benefited millions of people across the US, but given what’s been said, could it be one of the first executive orders to be scrapped? In addition to Data.gov, the summit will hear from many of these departments and municipalities including, the CIA and Department of Homeland Security, two agencies who will likely need to be at the centre of Trump’s policies. With these government departments presenting it is likely to paint a clearer picture of what the next four years is going to hold for government departments which have taken a more data-driven approach. As well as government departments, the summit will also host some of the most progressive companies in the world with P&G, Standard Chartered Bank, Johnson & Johnson, Morgan Stanley and Vevo, all taking to the stage across the two days at the Crowne Plaza Times Square Manhattan.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) NEW YORK • Major U.S. stock indexes slipped Friday as drug companies dragged the market lower. Small-company stocks bucked the downward trend and continued to climb, and bond yields rose to their highest level in a year. Drugmakers like Merck and biotech company Amgen took some of the biggest losses Friday. Weak results from Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch hurt retailers as investors kept a close eye on the upcoming holiday season. Small companies including regional banks continued to make large gains. Those stocks have risen sharply since the presidential election last week and are now at record highs. "Some of the proposals that [President-elect Donald] Trump has promoted, specifically deregulation and also some of his trade proposals, are better for small companies than potentially they are for large ones," said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for Northern Trust. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The Dow Jones industrial average slid 35.89 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,867.93. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 5.22 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,181.90. The Nasdaq composite touched a record high early on, but turned lower and gave up 12.46 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,321.51. That's not a big loss, but the major indexes hadn't fallen that much since before the presidential election. Still, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq finished substantially higher this week after their big gains the week before. But indexes of smaller companies, like the Russell 2000 and the S&P 600, did better. They are on 11-day winning streaks and have hit all-time highs. Among small-company stocks, mortgage lending service company LendingTree added $6.80, or 7.3 percent, to $100 and coal miner Cloud Peak Energy rose 79 cents, or 15.8 percent, to $5.79. Losses for drug companies weighed down health care stocks. Botox maker Allergan retreated $8.20, or 4.1 percent, to $191.78 and biotech giant Amgen fell $2.13, or 1.4 percent, to $145.23. Hepatitis C drugmaker Gilead Sciences shed 96 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $74.62. Drug company stocks are coming off their biggest weekly gain in two years. The stocks had been falling in the months leading up to the election because investors worried that under a Hillary Clinton presidency, the federal government would take steps to rein in drug prices. Those kinds of steps are less likely under a Trump presidency and a Republican-controlled Congress. The dollar continued to climb. It's near one-year highs against the euro and six-month highs against the yen. The dollar rose to 110.63 yen from 109.89 yen. The euro fell to $1.0599 from $1.0626. The dollar hasn't been this strong since early 2003. Nixon of Northern Trust said that's affecting big multinational companies because it can hurt their sales outside the U.S., but it's less of a problem for smaller, domestically-oriented companies. Investors continued to sell U.S. government bonds at a rapid clip, and bond prices wobbled and turned lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.34 percent from 2.30 percent. Bond prices have fallen hard since the election and yields are now at their highest in a year. Teen clothing company Abercrombie & Fitch plunged $2.33, or 13.8 percent, to $14.60 after it reported weak sales and a smaller profit than analysts had expected. Gap's said fewer people visited its stores heading into the holiday season. Its stock gave up $5.10, or 16.6 percent, to $25.61. Sporting goods Hibbett Sports retailer cut its annual forecasts after a weak third-quarter report. It dropped $4.90, or 10.8 percent, to $40.40. Shoppers are not buying as many clothes and moving toward discount chains. That trend continued as discount retailer Ross Stores rose $2.47, or 3.8 percent, to $68 after it posted a better-than-expected profit and sales. Companies that sell common household products are also moving lower. Procter & Gamble gave up $1.07, or 1.3 percent, to $82 and drugstore operator Walgreens Boots Alliance slumped 72 cents to $83.27. Those companies have fallen since the election as investors buy companies that could benefit more from faster economic growth. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 27 cents to close at $45.69 a barrel in New York, while Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, added 37 cents to $46.86 a barrel in London. Energy companies traded higher. Chevron rose $1.08, or 1 percent, to $109.20 and ConocoPhillips jumped $1.15, or 2.6 percent, to $44.76. » Next page...

Japanese shares rose, Friday, Nov. 18, 2016, on the yen's weakness while other Asian benchmarks wobbled after Fed chair Janet Yellen signaled that policymakers intend to raise interest rates soon. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) Updated at 3:15 p.m. U.S. stocks ended lower on Friday, with healthcare stocks leading the declines as investors cashed in on a post-election rally and waited for clarity on the next U.S. administration's policies. Based on the latest available data, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 35.68 points, or 0.19 percent, to 18,868.14, the S&P 500 had lost 5.17 points, or 0.24 percent, to 2,181.95 and the Nasdaq Composite had dropped 12.46 points, or 0.23 percent, to 5,321.51. Our earlier story:  U.S. stocks were lower in early afternoon trading on Friday as health stocks weighed and investors cashed in after the post-election rally, but the three major indexes continued to hover near record levels. The Nasdaq hit a record high earlier in the session, helped by a rise in Microsoft and other big tech stocks. Losses in shares of Merck and Johnson and Johnson dragged down the S&P health sector, which led the decliners with a 1.08 percent fall. U.S. stocks had been on a tear since Donald Trump's surprise victory in the presidential election last week as his proposals to increase infrastructure spending and reduce taxes are seen benefiting the economy. The rally lost steam this week as investors took to the sidelines, awaiting more clarity regarding Trump's policies. Still, the three major indexes are on track to close higher for the second week in a row. "I think given the major indexes are at or near all-time highs, we're probably due for a little bit of a digestion period," said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. "Equities are generally expected to move sideways until we get a little more of visibility into what some of the policies are going to be with the new administration." Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said on Thursday the central bank could raise interest rates "relatively soon," sending out a clear signal for a December move. Traders are pricing in an 83 percent chance of a December move, according to Thomson Reuters data. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he was leaning toward supporting an interest rate increase in December and that the real question now would be the Fed's rate path in 2017. Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Esther George also said that while she supports raising interest rates, the U.S. central bank must do so only gradually.

The S&P 500 was down 5.11 points, or 0.23 percent, at 2,182.01. The index hit a record high of 2,193.81 on Aug. 15. The Nasdaq Composite was down 12.70 points, or 0.24 percent, at 5,321.28. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower. Consumer Staples fell 0.45 percent, weighed down by a 1.1 percent fall in Procter & Gamble. Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch fell more than 10 percent after both retailers warned of a challenging holiday quarter. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,589 to 1,302. On the Nasdaq, 1,446 issues fell and 1,292 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 31 new 52-week highs and four new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 184 new highs and 22 new lows.

Written by Oliver Staley Obsession The Art of Parenting November 17, 2016 This family got paid leave. Most won’t. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa) Share Written by Oliver Staley Obsession The Art of Parenting November 17, 2016 This was supposed to the moment when the stars finally aligned for a paid family leave bill for American parents. But the odds for it suddenly look a lot longer with the election of Donald Trump. The Democrat-sponsored Family and Medical Insurance Leave (FAMILY) Act—which would require US employers to offer 12 weeks of paid leave to new mothers and fathers, funded by a payroll deduction—has been gaining traction in Congress and was expected to have its best chance yet of passing during a Hillary Clinton administration. Clinton had pitched her own paid-leave proposal, with a different funding mechanism, but it was otherwise fairly similar to the proposed legislation But with Republicans controlling the White House and Congress, the bill faces a tougher road than it did when it was first introduced last year. The results of the US presidential election have the bill’s supporters scrambling for new strategies, which include identifying Republican allies, pressuring businesses to expand their coverage, and trying to work with Trump. Trump introduced his own plan this summer, which calls for six weeks of maternity leave through an expansion of unemployment insurance. While parental leave supporters have serious issues with a plan for mothers only, and have doubts about his plan’s funding, they’re heartened that Trump is at least willing to discuss the issue. “It is the first time that a Republican talked about paid leave in a general election, and put forward a plan, even if it was a flawed plan,” says Vicki Shabo, vice president of the National Partnership for Women & Families, which has lobbied for paid leave. Republicans have traditionally viewed any paid-leave mandate as an unwanted intrusion into the rights of employers to run their business as they wish. But Shabo notes that another Republican presidential candidate this year, Florida senator Marco Rubio, also proposed a parental-leave plan, based on tax credits for employers. Shabo hopes other Republican officials might get behind paid leave when they understand how popular it is with voters. “In polling, this is not a partisan issue,” she said. “These are winning issues and these policies will have a practical impact on people’s lives.” In a Roosevelt Institute poll last year, 83% of respondents, including 67% of Republicans, supported paid leave. Paid-leave advocates intend to turn up the pressure on politicians who oppose the idea. PL+US, a newly established nonprofit devoted to the issue, is considering forming a political action committee targeting members of Congress, said Katie Bethell, the group’s founder and executive director. “Right now, there is no cost for opposing paid family leave,” she said. PL+US is also launching a campaign to highlight companies with generous family leave policies, and to identify the ones that are lagging. In a report released on Nov. 16, the group attempted to document the parental leave provisions of the 60 biggest US employers, while noting that many refused to discuss their policies. (Only about half of the companies publicly disclose their policies or were willing to confirm them, leaving PL+US to rely on other means to gather the data.) “We definitely want companies to be transparent about their policies,” Bethell said. “It matters for employees, prospective employees, and policy makers.” According to PL+US, the companies with the most expansive policies are Deloitte, Ernst & Young, and Bank of America, all of which provide 16 weeks of fully paid leave for mothers, fathers, and adoptive parents. Others, such as Starbucks and General Motors, offer shorter policies of six to eight weeks off. A number of employers, like Hilton and Procter & Gamble, offer birth mothers substantially longer leave than fathers, while a significant number give fathers no paid time off at all. Offering leave to all parents is important because leave policies mothers only can reinforce stereotypes about the role of women as caregivers, and can be used to discriminate against women in hiring and promotion, Shabo said. The PL+US report also noted there are a large number of employers that offer no paid time off for either parent. And the Department of Labor says only 12% of all US worker are eligible for some form of paid leave, which is one reason why advocates had been pinning their hopes to federal legislation.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases pr @ satprnews.com Sprinklr Acquires Influencer Identification and Marketing Platform Little Bird NEW YORK & PORTLAND, Ore.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Sprinklr, the most complete social media management platform for the enterprise, today announced it has acquired Little Bird, a Portland-based technology company that helps brands analyze connections across the social web to discover top influencers who can galvanize word-of-mouth marketing; build like-minded communities and create relevant content to increase engagement; and identify early-movers to accelerate the discovery of trends. According to eMarketer, seventy-five percent of marketing and communication professionals say that identifying the right influencers is the biggest challenge when building an influencer engagement strategy. Little Bird’s technology addresses this problem in a unique way by leveraging contextual segmentation and social graph analysis to discover the best influencers based on their reputation around specific topics and conversations, not their follower count. Little Bird’s technology will enhance Sprinklr’s audience insights, segmentation, advertising, and analytics capabilities as part of the only unified platform for enterprises to engage customers and manage their experience at scale. As part of Sprinklr’s complete platform, the company’s technology will bring actionable insights to each customer-facing department, allowing marketers to find potential evangelists and reach them with highly relevant content or ads; care teams to surface experts that can, in turn, support a wider community of customers; and research teams to better understand what their most valued customers think about their product. Microsoft, for example, uses Little Bird’s technology to support a core pillar of its product marketing strategy. “Little Bird’s insights are helping our team speak like a living, breathing member of our customer communities,” said Aileen McGraw, Product Marketing Manager, Microsoft.com. “We live in an age of connected and empowered consumers where it no longer matters what companies say about themselves – it’s what their customers say that determines whether a business will fail or thrive,” said Ragy Thomas, Founder & CEO of Sprinklr. “As the market consolidates from best-of-breed to best-of-suite solutions, we’re thrilled to have Little Bird’s talented team bring its technology to the world’s most complete social media management platform for the enterprise, and give our clients a deeper understanding of the trends that matter most so they can cut through the noise and create more personal, consistent, and informed experiences for their customers.” Founded in 2011, Little Bird secured seed funding in 2012 from Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and other tech industry leaders. A second round of funding from the Oregon Angel Fund followed in early 2014, and a round in 2016 led by Jason Calacanis’ AngelList Syndicate fueled a new phase of growth and innovation. “Our influencer discovery and research technology has delivered significant value to product and content marketers, customer care teams, market intelligence groups, and many others at some of the world’s best known brands,” said Marshall Kirkpatrick, Co-Founder & Chairman of Little Bird. “Sprinklr offers a unified system of engagement that helps each of these functions make use of social media at scale. Now, with deeper influencer-driven insights, those customer-facing teams and the enterprise they support will be that much smarter.” The acquisition, Sprinklr’s eleventh overall, comes on the heels of the company’s latest funding round in July, when it raised $105 million at a $1.8 billion valuation. Sprinklr saw dramatic growth last year – becoming, in Q3 2015, one of the fastest enterprise SaaS companies in history to eclipse $100 million in annual revenue. That growth is the result of a strategic shift in the way brands are using social across the enterprise – from marketing to care, research, sales, commerce, advertising, and beyond – a trend that Sprinklr anticipated from the beginning and was purpose-built to address.

About Sprinklr Sprinklr provides the most complete enterprise social technology in the world, designed to help large companies collaborate across their entire organization to create intuitive, superior customer experiences across every social channel.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 17 November 2016 | MYT 9:44 AM Facebook aims for more transparency with video ad data More transparent: Facebook launched a new blog on its website, where it will share updates and corrections for its data. — Reuters Two months after Facebook Inc admitted it had inflated the average time it told advertisers that users were watching their video ads, the company is promising better data to give ad buyers a clearer picture of how they are spending their money. The world's biggest online social network launched a new blog on its website called Metrics FYI, where it will share updates and corrections for its data. “We want to ensure our clients trust and believe in the metrics that we are providing,” Carolyn Everson, Facebook's vice president of global market solutions told Reuters. Getting advertisers to buy more video ads is key to Facebook’s continued revenue growth, as they fetch higher rates from advertisers than text or photo-based ads. Facebook, along with Alphabet Inc's Google and other large digital companies, has been criticised for a lack of transparency in how it measures the performance of videos. Particularly, the lack of a universally agreed method of calculating how much time people are watching online video has been a sore spot for advertisers. Shares of Facebook were down 2.5% in premarket trading on the New York Stock Exchange. In September, Facebook told advertisers that the average time users spent viewing online ads was artificially inflated, because it was only counting videos that were watched for at least three seconds, its benchmark for a “view.” Facebook left out those who watched for less than three seconds, or who did not watch the video at all, which gave advertisers the impression their videos were performing better than they really were. Since the admission and ensuing criticism from advertisers, Everson said Facebook has been in contact with clients and ad community trade groups, including the Interactive Advertising Bureau and the Association of National Advertisers (ANA). Facebook also said on Wednesday it is in the process of forming what it called a 'Measurement Council,' which will include measurement experts from clients and ad agencies. One of Facebook's prominent advertisers, Swiss food and drink company Nestle SA, is already on board, Everson said, and the council should be up and running by early 2017. The ANA, which represents Procter & Gamble Co, AT&T Inc and other major advertisers, has called on Facebook to get its metrics accredited by the Media Rating Council (MRC), an independent media measurement audit group. While Facebook’s internal metrics are not accredited by that group, it does use MRC-accredited third-party vendors, such as Nielsen and comScore, to help advertisers verify certain data. —  Reuters You May Be Interested German minister says Facebook should be treated as a media company Huawei eyes Africa with Nova Sign your name digitally in iOS Mail Toms launches Apple Watch wrist bands 'Overwatch' releases Sombra update after months of hints Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read French in centre-right primary to pick presidential candidate to face Le Pen Lavishing patrons with ‘arty’ delights Chelsea take over at the top by beating Middlesbrough advertisement Latest News China wants fewer, but better, electric car makers US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)
