Although Facebook continues to grow users, revenue, and profit, there may be headwinds up ahead. Jamal Carnette (TMFJCar) Aug 14, 2016 at 11:36AM Facebook shares have increased more than 200% since its 2012 IPO. Image Source: Facebook. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has been on a tremendous run. Shares of the company are up 33% over the last year versus 6% for the greater Nasdaq-100 index. It's not as if Facebook's run is undeserved; the company has continued to grow revenue, users, and profit at rates higher than Wall Street expectations. As a result, analysts have a one-year target price for Facebook at $154, approximately 24% above its current price. While price targets are often wrong, there are industry-wide tailwinds that bolster the bullish case. Advertising spending continues to shift from television to digital outlets. In particular, mobile spending has exploded and will continue to do so according to eMarketer. And with 1.57 billion mobile monthly active users, or MAUs, Facebook is the largest beneficiary of mobile ad spending. More recently, however, there's been a few threats to the company's business model. When viewed individually, it's easy to dismiss these concerns as inconsequential. When viewed together, however, it points to a company that may have more risks than Wall Street currently realizes. Procter and Gamble finds Facebook's hyped targeting prowess may be overstated In the marketing realm, there's no company more influential than Procter & Gamble. The multinational consumer-goods conglomerate boasts 22 individual brands that gross over $1 billion in sales annually. Many of which are in the fast-moving consumer goods, or FMCG, market characterized by frequent purchases and intense competition. In the FMCG industry branding and marketing matter a great deal, so it's no surprise P&G is the biggest advertising spender in the entire world with a significant portion of that going to Facebook. Facebook has been so successful in digital marketing because of the vast amount of data it has on each user. Presumably, this data can be used for targeted ads, which are generally more effective. However, The Wall Street Journal (subscription required) reported P&G announced this month it would stop its practice of targeting, finding the process has "limited effectiveness." Whether or not targeting effectiveness is the issue -- or if P&G's advertising strategy is lacking -- is of little consequence, as marketing is one of those fields where it's hard to gauge effectiveness and perception is reality. But it has been these targeted ads that have allowed Facebook to charge above-average rates for ads and kept ad-load low while expanding revenue. A shift away from targeted ads to broad, cheaper ads could present headwinds to top-line growth. An ad-blocking arms race Additionally, Facebook is locked in a cat-and-mouse game with ad-blocking software. This month the company announced it would incorporate ad-blocking-blocking technology on its desktop site. Essentially, the company would make it harder for plug-ins like AdblockPlus to filter out its ads. Within a few days the open-source community had found a workaround, or an ad-blocking-blocker-blocker, which allows you to browse the site without ads even after Facebook's update. It's important to note this alone is not a major concern. My thoughts are Facebook and the ad-blocking community will continue to play this whack-a-mole game to the point the average user will no longer care. Additionally, ad-blocking technology does not work on Facebook's mobile app, which is how the vast majority of its MAUs access the site. What this signifies is the growing resistance of users to advertising, which could affect Facebook in the event it has to increase ad load to make up for falling ad rates if there is a shift from targeted ads. Growing apprehension from content providers The last risk is important. First, it's important to note that while Facebook is the largest outlet by mobile ad-spend, it doesn't really create its own content. Instead, it uses the content from unpaid contributors (aka users) and attaches advertising. This description is not to dismiss its business model, but to describe the risk of disputes with its user base. Image Source: Facebook Until recently, the digital publishing community, a major source of content, had looked at the relationship with Facebook as a win-win. A simple look at the fact both entities are competing for the same advertising dollars, essentially eating from the same trough, would have told you this was fiction. Publishers appeared to have gotten the memo. A few changes Facebook has instituted -- limited advertising in exchange for inclusion on the company's Instant Article feature, then changing rules to the detriment of publishers' native-advertising businesses, and Facebook limiting publishers' reach -- have given publishers reason to pause. Television, at this point, is very apprehensive about negotiating with Facebook on displaying their video content. The Wall Street Journal (subscription required) notes the NFL, Walt Disney Company, and Comcast's NBCUniversal are not looking to deal with Facebook as the dual concerns over ceding control of content (see paragraph above) and a shift to digital ad spend may present more risks than the incremental revenue they'd receive. These issues show how important the company has become It's important to restate none of these situations are incredibly important to the company's stock performance on their own. When taken together, however, it shows a company that has transitioned from prey to predator. But as the company continues to transition from just another marketing outlet to the most important force in marketing, concerns like these will most likely increase in both scope and severity. It would behoove investors, myself included, to note these new risks to Facebook's business model. Jamal Carnette owns shares of Facebook.

Bronze medalist Kim Rhode on Aug. 12. Photographer: Sam Greenwood/Getty Images Landing a big-name sponsor might be the bigger feat. In the year leading up to Rio 2016, Rhode’s agent Patrick Quinn pitched her to around 20 companies that back the Olympics. None were convinced. “The big mystery is how someone like Kim isn’t part of the Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, and the Olympics sponsor push,’’ Quinn said by phone from Chicago.“It would be nice to have an Olympic sponsor recognize the magnitude of her accomplishment.’’ Coca-Cola Co. didn’t respond to a request for comment, and Procter & Gamble Co.’s spokesperson Damon Jones said in an e-mail the company receives hundreds of sponsorship requests so it must be selective. Rhode and other shooters on Team USA think the reason they’re passed over is obvious. The rise in gun violence and mass shootings in the US have attached a stigma to shooting as a sport, they say. So while companies like Winchester, Beretta and Otis Technology support Rhode, she doesn’t have a single sponsor from outside the firearm industry. The same is true for USA Shooting, even though the sport has since 2000 been the fifth-highest medal producer for the US team at Summer Olympics. The very first gold medal for any sport awarded in Rio went to 19-year-old Ginny Thrasher, competing in her Olympics debut. Start your day with what’s moving markets.

American television audiences don’t tend to watch shooting – or, for that matter, a number of other sports. “The biggest challenge is limited exposure,” said Peter Carlisle, head of the Olympic Sports and Action division at Octagon Worldwide. “If the sport itself doesn’t provide a consistent platform for the athletes to become recognizable and maintain relevance, there’s limited value to a sponsor.” What’s more, noted Scott Becher, the executive vice president of sports and entertainment at Zimmerman Advertising, a lot of Americans own firearms, so the potential affinity exists. A Costly Sport The difference for shooters is the cost of training. Competition-level firearms price between $8,000-20,000. Between ammunition, clay pigeons and range fees, a day of training can run as high as $450. “It really adds up,’’ said Vincent Hancock, one of Rhode’s teammates. “I’ve only found two sports that are more expensive -- anything to do with a horse, and car racing.’’ The US Olympic Committee helps foot the bill. Because of shooting’s high potential to medal, USA Shooting received $2.5 million in 2015, third-most among summer sports behind swimming and track and field. Still, the ammunition provided by the federation doesn’t always cover athlete’s needs. The day before departing for Rio, for example, Rhode shot 450 targets, she said. Similar Challenges As for Hancock, on Saturday he will attempt to win a gold medal in his third consecutive Olympics for skeet shooting. Even as one of the sport’s favorites, Hancock still struggles to prevail upon potential backers who aren’t tied in some way to the firearm industry. “A lot of times they say, well, we really like you, you’re great and your credentials speak for themselves, but we’re not sure how we can really fit you in,’’ Hancock said. “It seems like they want to, but don’t want to get caught up in the media backlash that may arise if something were to come about with, say, one of the shootings.’’ Shooters in other countries have faced similar challenges. Even in Italy, where the national shooting federation claims about 500,000 members – its U.S. counterpart has about 5,250 – the team struggled to transcend sponsors’ fears about firearms. “You talk about rifles and pistols and people are afraid, especially in Europe with the recent terrorism,’’ said Luciano Rossi, an Italian senator who is also president of the country’s shooting federation, and also vice-president of the international shooting federation. “We must offer a new image of our sport. If the spectators know our sport, they understand and love us, and if they love us, the sponsors come.’’ Watch Next: Athletes Have Always Cheated, And They May Never Stop Athletes Have Always Cheated, And They May Never Stop Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

They have always seemed to represent and encourage the worst things in the world around us. Before I get too “tired and emotional” I should emphasise that it is not just marketing people who make me feel this way. Lawyers come a close second. And if I see – as I have over the past week – evidence of pain among them, it is hard to hide a quiet pleasure. Part of my distaste for marketing folks is well founded, I believe. But I confess too that part is sheer envy. This began when I was a young journalist in the Financial Times, when I was literally sweating 13-hour days to hit 8pm or 9pm news deadlines. At that time, everyone on the marketing and advertising side of the paper (all males of course) took Friday off on the golf course, arguing that contracts could not be secured without entertaining clients on the fairways. The brazen audacity took my breath away. The fact they succeeded outraged me, and made me deeply jealous. The fact that my venerable employer gave them a four-day week, paid their golf club memberships, covered their green fees and then paid for them to entertain their golf-playing clients, struck me as a scandalous con. But putting this unalloyed envy on one side, I have good reasons for my spite. It is marketing people that take all of our “wants” and on behalf of mainly big-brand companies spin those wants into indispensable “needs”. It is this spinning process, transforming wants into needs that sit at the heart of the consumer obsession that makes “malling” one of the world’s leading pastimes. By creatively and often brilliantly fuelling this consumer obsession (I may hate these people, but I cannot deny the brilliance they sometimes display), they are at the heart of the mindless accumulation of “stuff” that litters our homes and our lives, and puts such pressure on landfills around the world. If I could blame the global environmental crisis and climate change wholly on them, I would, but I suspect that would be a tad too extreme – there are others to blame alongside them. ...it puzzles me so many executives are willing to spend awesome billions of dollars on advertisements on TV or in newspapers and magazines in the profound conviction that the future of their businesses depends on it Because I am an avid and life-long advertisement avoider, it also puzzles me that so many executives are willing to spend awesome billions of dollars on advertisements on TV or in newspapers and magazines in the profound conviction that the future of their businesses depends on it. For example, Procter & Gamble, the world’s biggest advertiser, spends 11 per cent of its total annual revenues – approximately US$7.24bn – on advertising its washing powder, dypers and so on. If everyone else were like me, studiously avoiding adverts wherever and whenever they appear, then this would be money that is wholly wasted and could almost certainly be put to much better use. But of course I have to bite my tongue. It seems not everyone else is like me despite the massive popularity of “ad-blocking” apps that over 400 million internet users download to keep advertisers at bay. There are some people out there who really do read the adverts, seek them out even, happy to be persuaded that the latest fad (Pokemon Go?) is actually a need rather than a self-indulgent want, and are happy to buy the latest Gucci handbag so it can sit unused alongside the many other unused handbags that eventually end up being resold at extraordinary prices through “Milan Station”. So I was pleased this week to discover that the advertising industry is an industry in distress, as the digital giants hoover up an increasing share of global “ad spend” and cast aside those thousands of ad salesmen (most were men) who for so many decades indispensably plied the world’s golf courses securing ad deals from their golf-addicted clients. Company results over the past week from Facebook and Google signalled massive growth in advertising revenues, and prompted predictions that digital advertising will in the next two years pass US$200 billion, for the first time overtaking overall ad spending on TV. Facebook alone reported advertising revenues of US$6.24bn in the second quarter this year, up 63 per cent from the second quarter last year. Growth at Google was lower at around 20 per cent, but its massive scale meant advertising revenue was 50 per cent higher than Facebook. Of course, my pleasure was short-lived, because it was quickly clear that worldwide, the enthusiasm of the likes of Procter & Gamble to spend dizzying billions on advertising is as rampant as ever. Industry stress comes from the astonishing pace of shift to digital advertising, from the rising oligopoly of Facebook and Google, who today account for 72 per cent of the world’s online advertising outside China, and from alarming stories of digital “fraud” in the online advertising industry. This last alarum is fascinating. Out of an estimated US$159 billion spent on digital advertising in 2015, experts say around a third is lost to “botnet”-wielding fraudsters – a cool US$50 billion. A study last year of 10 billion online ads found that for worst-hit companies, almost 40 per cent of visits to ad sites are from computer hackers rather than potential buyers In short, computer hacking networks called botnets infect and capture literally millions of computers and then drive further millions of visits to adverts on key websites. Since most advertisers like Procter & Gamble pay websites on the basis of how many hits their adverts get, the potential to bloat hits by using hacker-generated bots posing as human eyes is immense. A study last year of 10 billion online ads found that for worst-hit companies, almost 40 per cent of visits to ad sites are from computer hackers rather than potential buyers. All the more worrying then that Facebook is introducing technology to make it harder for people to use “ad-blockers” that shield them from the relentless onslaught of advertisers. Industry experts say around 420 million smartphone users currently use one or more ad-blocking app, with a further 200 million on laptop or desktop computers. These are comforting numbers to me, showing I am not alone in my efforts to keep advertising out of my life, but I think all of us know that we are ultimately fighting a losing battle as digital technology allows advertisers to probe deeper and deeper into our lives, redefining what should be regarded as private, and what’s public. Hate them as I may, I think I am doomed to continue envying those marketing and advertising guys in perpetuity.

GE execs are settling into temporary digs in Fort Point, gearing up for an Aug. 22 opening, and planning for a future complex on the Fort Point Channel. The setting is a stark contrast to suburban Connecticut and key to Immelt’s goal of changing the corporate culture. Welcome to Boston, GE. You’re not in Fairfield anymore. A look at GE’s current campus, and how it stacks up with plans for its Boston headquarters. Bob Child/Associated Press/File The basics Fairfield, Conn.

South Station (pictured) is right across the channel, and the Green and Orange lines aren’t far. South Boston residents can squeeze onto the No. 7 bus or the No. 11 Globe Photo/File Commuting nightmare Fairfield: Traffic jams on the Merritt Parkway (pictured), made much worse when there’s an accident or breakdown Boston: That infamous entrance to Interstate 93 North, off Atlantic Avenue, where the backups tend to grind all cars in a half-mile radius to a complete stop Helipad Fairfield: Yes, of course Boston: Somewhere, someday Potential weather threats Fairfield: Flooding on the Merritt; nor’easters Boston: Climate change; sea level rise Globe Staff/File Wildlife Fairfield: Wayward deer, aggressive turkeys Boston: Wayward rats (pictured), aggressive seagulls Globe Staff/File Nearby hotels Fairfield: The city has a few hotels, but only one, the Hi-Ho, is close. There is a 28-room “guest house” on site Boston: A long list within a short walk; the old-school Boston Harbor Hotel (pictured) and the newer Residence Inn and Envoy, to name a few GENERAL ELECTRIC/GENSLER Biggest quirks Fairfield: A 28-room hotel and conference center, aka the “guest house,” that’s free to guests and employees; a 20-foot metal fan-like sculpture, “Turbo”; walking trails; and, as GE’s real estate broker puts it, numerous other features “attractive to discerning corporations” Boston (rendering): The giant “solar veil” rising 65 feet above the roof, one that’s been described as a James Bond villain super weapon; a GE logo of a similar scale, visible from parts of downtown; a GE museum open to the public; a still-undetermined tribute to that rock club the Channel, which closed in the early 1990s Globe Staff/File Nightlife options Fairfield: Nothing in walking distance. But there’s always Barcelona, popular among GE suburbanites, 2 miles away at the Hi-Ho hotel Boston: Lucky’s is one of the area’s longest-lasting denizens, but now it has plenty of company: Barlow’s, Bastille, Blue Dragon, Drink, Menton, Papagayo, Pastoral, Sportello (pictured), and Tavern Road — and that’s just within a couple blocks Jon Chesto can be reached at jon.chesto@globe.com. Follow him on Twitter @jonchesto.

Some are known for their unique combination of natural ingredients, while others contain nutrients like vitamins, and minerals promising to give you younger looking skin. These days, women understand the advantages of choosing the right makeup and beauty products. They are not ready to compromise on quality no matter if they have to spend hundreds of bucks on a single item. The trend of using makeup has become common, so every makeup brand enlisted here is known for its remarkable range of products. We are confident that these companies will give a new horizon to the world by 2017. Olay Lipsticks, moisturizing creams, and personal care products of Olay are world renowned. It is an outstanding and famous #Skincare line of the US. According to a report, Olay is a top ranked company of Procter & Gamble. During the 2015 fiscal year, this firm generated more than $80 billion revenues. With the passage of time, Olay has expanded its network and has included total effect moisturizers, body lotions, white radiance creams, nail paints, lip glosses, and other items in its range. For the women who are conscious about their beauty, Olay has presented a series of anti-aging creams. The most interesting thing is that this brand’s makeup items are least expensive. L'Oreal L’Oreal is famous among the top beauty experts worldwide. This French cosmetics company has its headquarters in Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine. Other than this, L’Oreal has its outlets in Paris, New York, London, Dubai, and Mumbai. Over the years, the company has presented top-notch skincare and makeup products. Its hair colors, sun protection creams, fragrances, shampoos, and conditioners are famous among the American and European ladies. This brand has been around since the 19th century, and its foundation was laid by Eugène Paul Louis Schueller. Avon Though Avon is least famous but still this makeup and beauty brand is likely to play its vital role in shaping the future of fashion industry by 2017. It is an American manufacturer of beauty, household and personal care products. According to an estimate, Avon’s revenues alone in December 2015 were $10 billions. It is one of the largest enterprises with more than six million representatives worldwide. Currently, Sherilyn S.

It’s only been done once before, in the Winter Games. Although not necessarily one of the high-visibility glamour events perhaps, Rhode won a bronze in yesterday’s skeet shooting competition at the Rio Olympics. She won her first medal, a gold, in the 1996 Games in Atlanta. Rhode captured the bronze after an intense shoot-off with China’s Meng Wei at the Olympic Shooting Center. “It’s a stunning accomplishment from Rhode, who becomes the first female Olympian to medal in six consecutive games, and the first summer Olympian as well. Only Italian luger Armin Zoeggeler has done it on the men’s side,” USA TODAY explained. “Rhode’s Olympic history has been nothing short of dominant. She won gold in the 1996 Games in double trap at the age of 17, then followed up with bronze in Sydney, gold in Athens, silver in Beijing, and then gold in London.” Southern California resident Rhode, 37, plans to compete at the Tokyo Olympic Games for Team USA in the year 2020 and even has her eye on 2024 if Los Angeles winds up as the host city. “The act of shooting requires fewer physical attributes, extending Olympic lifespans,” NBC Olympics observed. Congrats to @KimRhode, the 1st female Olympian to medal in 6 consecutive games! @USAShooting Photo by @kevinjairaj pic.twitter.com/38cZBz14sT — USATODAYSportsImages (@usatsimg) August 12, 2016 In recent years, she has had overcome some serious personal health challenges such as a difficult pregnancy and gall bladder surgery, as well as illnesses among her family and close friends. “As the younger shooters on the U.S. team traveled the world, sharpening their skills, winning competitions she used to dominate, Rhode struggled to walk around the block. Back on the range, her strength returned slowly,” the Los Angeles Times recalled. Upon winning the bronze medal in Rio, Rhode told Fox Sports that “It doesn’t matter if it’s the gold, silver or the bronze. It’s the journey and my journey this time was very, very challenging and as you can tell, very emotional. I’m still emotional.” Prior to her Olympic medal win in Rio, Kim Rhode weighed in on gun control and gun rights in an interview with Time. “The Second Amendment was put in there not just so we can go shoot skeet or go shoot trap. It was put in so we could defend our First Amendment, the freedom of speech, and also to defend ourselves against our own government.” She also suggested in the Time exchange that the media seems to attach a stigma to competitive shooting as it relates or doesn’t relate to the ongoing gun control debate. “When you are talking to a NASCAR driver, they’re not asked to comment on an incident that occurred with a vehicle.” Rhode described the San Bernardino terrorist attack as heartbreaking tragedy but one that apparently provides further justification for law-abiding citizens to carry firearms. American Kim Rhode becomes first woman to individually medal in 6 straight Olympics. #TeamUSA #Rio2016 https://t.co/j815U1M8pF — FOX Sports (@FOXSports) August 13, 2016 That stigma apparently prevents Olympic shooters like Kim Rhode from receiving lucrative corporate sponsorships (apart from a few gun manufacturers) from which other medalists benefit. “Will we see Rhode on a box of Wheaties? Most likely not. The shooting sports are no different than any other sport and the qualities of shooting champions are the same qualities we value from other great athletes: dedication, determination and hard work,” PJ Media insisted. “The big mystery is how someone like Kim isn’t part of the Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, and the Olympics sponsor push. It would be nice to have an Olympic sponsor recognize the magnitude of her accomplishment,” Kim Rhode’s agent commented on the situation according to Bloomberg News. Kim Rhode also chided the new, stricter California gun control regulations enacted after San Bernardino. “I shoot 500 to 1,000 rounds a day, so having to do a background check every time I purchase ammo, or every time I want to bring ammo in or out of a competition or a match, those are very challenging for me. Also, I’ve had guns in my family for generations that have been passed down, and now I’m going to register them as assault weapons… It definitely does effect me and gives me a reason to speak out more.” <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DwMg7CYi7kA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> She revealed to the Guardian that she supports Donald Trump for president, in part because of his strong support for the Second Amendment, the right enshrined in the U.S. Constitution to keep and bear arms. She acknowledged that electing a female president “would be incredible, just not Hillary.” “She also startled a French reporter when she told him that she has her three-year-old son in youth programs with the National Rifle Association,” the Guardian added about Olympic medalist Kim Rhode.

The pungent aroma of indiscernible sweet scents wafts out the door and into the rest of the building. “Perfumery is one of the old world crafts, just like silversmithing or goldsmithing,” he said. Al Adamson in the laboratory at Creative Fragrances Photo credit: Gianni Windahl Adamson, one of only about 200 perfumers in the U.S. and executive vice president at Creative Fragrances, a perfume manufacturing company located in northeast Dallas, clearly likes his job. Adamson revealed the hidden side of the perfume industry to a Daily Campus reporter one day recently. He explained the difference between synthetic fragrances and natural fragrances and gave insight into how a fragrance perfumer is made and how fragrances are created. According to a 2015 report by NPD, a data collection company, the perfume business is a $28 billion industry globally and nearly $6 billion in the United States. Some SMU students, such as first-year Elizabeth Whitson, add fuel to the fire. “I really love perfume, I always wear it before I go out,” said Whitson. The all-natural beauty products trend has created some controversy over the use of synthetic chemicals in perfume versus natural oils, Adamson acknowledged. But there are pros and cons to both. Essential oils are more expensive, harder to come by, and occasionally more irritating to the skin than some fragrances that are produced synthetically. Natural essential oils are extracted from crop products, and they can be expensive. Rose absolute is $1,024 a pound, for instance, and sandalwood oil is $1,500 to $4,000 a pound. Essential oils are also a limited resource. “There are many essential oils right now, like chamomile Roman oil that only come from Italy or England. But they are unavailable because the whole world supply has been purchased by designer fragrance companies,” said Adamson. He added that a perfumer cannot buy Roman chamomile until the next crop comes out in August. “So there’s none available in the world until August of this year and I’m sure everyone’s going to buy it all up once it’s released,” said Adamson. Perfumers sometimes choose to face these challenges because essential oils provide the fullest fragrance. He said that synthetic oils are trying to mimic what natural oil, such as lavender oil, smells like. However, there are certain chemicals in parts per million in the natural lavender plant oil that are impossible to synthesize at a chemical plant. “The natural lavender oil tends to have a fuller more rounded odor. So synthetics tend to be a little thinner, a little weaker, sometimes smell a little chemical-ly and different from the natural plant,” said Adamson. Some SMU students, such as second-year Whitney Smith, have expressed concern over fragrance allergies. “I start sneezing when I smell some perfumes,” Smith said. But what people may not know is that some of the chemicals in natural oils can be more irritating than those made in factories. Take for example, natural lavender, which contains 35 to 40 chemical ingredients. Two of the main chemicals are linalool and linalool acetate, which are slight skin allergens. They are found in the plant naturally, and cannot be taken out because they are a main component in the scent. But linalool and linalool acetate can also be made in chemical plants, and used to create synthetic lavender oil. And when a chemist is making the synthetic version of lavender, he can adjust the level in the formula so it is not as irritating. “So from a safety standpoint, almost all of natural essential oils contain allergens. So when you make a synthetic version of some of these naturals, you can actually make it safer by limiting or reducing the amount of the allergens that are in the natural product,” said Adamson. For those with allergies, he suggests purchasing synthetic fragrance or buying unscented or lightly scented products. The science that goes into making perfume is exact, and Adamson highlighted the process of becoming a perfumer and then making perfumes. “You can’t go to SMU and get a degree in perfumery- it doesn’t exist. There are essentially no colleges that have diplomas in perfumery because it’s such a small profession,” said Adamson, who completed his apprenticeship program at Proctor & Gamble. He said that an aspiring perfumer has to apprentice under a master perfumer for five to eight years to learn the craft. In these years, the student studies all of the ingredients and memorizes their odors. This is no small feat, since there are approximately 5,000 different synthetic chemicals over 150 essential oils that can be used in fragrance. Once the student has completed his program, he joins the American Society of Perfumers. The perfumer can then set out on the task of creating a fragrance. Adamson provided an example of how he might create a lemon scent for a cleaning product. There are around 500 ingredients that can be used in a lemon scent. Adamson said he chooses the top 10 to 30 ingredients he thinks will fit. He then fills out a formula card with the percentages of those ingredients and sends it to the laboratory to be created. Once it’s made, he checks to see if it smells the way he intended, and he “costs it out” to make sure it’s inexpensive enough for the cheap cleaning product. “It’s sort of a trial and error process after that, but the original formula you have created in your mind,” Adamson said. Whether it is fragrance for a detergent, or the discerning consumer, the perfume industry will adapt. Former account coordinator for Guerlain fragrance, Patricia Arnold, said that in the 1980s fragrances were predominately synthetic, a fact that was rarely questioned by the customer. Arnold added that department stores today now offer multiple choices of 100 percent natural fragrances as well. “The modern department store has its bases covered and truly offers something for everyone,” Arnold said.

Tweet   Over 7 Toxic Chemicals Found In Laundry Detergent! Over 7 Toxic Chemicals Found In Laundry Detergent! It's time to start protecting your family and children.   EcoWasher Detergent Free Toxic Free Laundry   EcoWasher Detergent Free Toxic Free Laundry   (EMAILWIRE.COM, August 13, 2016 ) Chicago, IL - You could smell it when you stroll down the laundry aisle. In some cases it's so bad you need to cover your nose. All those perfumes. It's not simply your creativity. In 2008, researchers reported on the toxic chemicals in laundry cleaning agents and other laundry items. Annmarie Skin Care viewers were probably way ahead of them. Most of us know that with artificial fragrance come chemicals that our body doesn't take care of (to place it gently). Given that 2008, more chemicals located alike supermarket detergents have actually surfaced. As a matter of fact, we discovered 7 even more, and have actually noted them for you right here, along with some healthier alternatives. You should not have to suffer asthma or dermatitis simply to have clean garments. Researchers Discover Evidence of What We've Suspected. Initially, allow us to's consider that study. Scientists from the University of Washington researched top-selling laundry and air-freshening products and discovered that they discharged lots of various chemicals. All them released at the very least one identified as toxic or hazardous under government laws! Worse-- none of these chemicals was noted on the label. Among the items tested were an anti-static sheet, a fabric softener, and a laundry detergent, as well as spray and plug-in air fresheners. Results showed almost ONE HUNDRED volatile organic substances (VOCs) emitted from the six products, and none were on the tag. "5 of the 6 products produced several cancer causing 'hazardous air toxins,' which are thought about by the Environmental Protection Agency to have no safe direct exposure level," stated study author Anne Steinemann. That's not all. A later 2011 study by the very same researchers located that air ducted from machines utilizing top-selling scented liquid laundry detergent and aromatic anti-static sheet consisted of unsafe chemicals, consisting of 2 categorized as carcinogens. For the study, scientists ran a lots of laundry once without products, as soon as with a leading brand name of scented liquid laundry detergent, and when with both the detergent and an anti-static sheet. They recorded the exhaust from the clothes dryer vent with a canister. An evaluation of the recorded air proved to greater than 25 VOCs, consisting of 7 harmful air contaminants. The two carcinogens were acetaldehyde and benzene. " These items could affect not just individual health," stated Steinemann, "however likewise public and ecological health. The chemicals can enter into the air, down the tubes and right into water bodies.". 7 Toxic Chemicals in Laundry Detergents. Let's look much more carefully at what producers are putting into laundry cleaning agents that could not be good for our health:. Fragrance: This is among the major problems, and the emphasis of both researches above. Suppliers integrate a variety of chemicals to create a scent-- so you'll believe your clothes are clean due to the fact that they scent clean-- and they don't have to detail those chemicals on the tag as a result of trade defense. As we've seen, a few of those chemicals can be extremely toxic. Cleaning brokers (surfactants): These are consisted of in the formula in order to help the item tidy better. Examples include chemicals like quaternium-15 (known to release formaldehyde, a well-known health hazard), diethanolamine (related to skin and eye inflammation and possibly liver problems), nonlphenol ethoxylate or NPE (toxic to nerves, annoying to skin, possible hormone disruptor, toxic to water life), linear alkyl benzene sulfonates or LAS (annoying to skin and eyes and toxic to water life; benzene by itself is a carcinogen), and oil extracts (connected to cancer and lung damages). Stabilizers: These chemicals aid maintain the formula, to make sure that it lasts much longer on the shelf. Instances include polyalkylene oxide or ethylene oxide, which are linked with eye and lung irritability, or even dermatitis. Bleach: Bleach might be used independently or may be included in the detergent itself. It's recognized to aggravate skin, eyes, and lungs, and when it mixes with wastewater, it could create toxic organic compounds that have been related to breathing concerns, liver, and kidney damages. 1,4-dioxane: This is a chemical byproduct of detergent manufacturing. In independent tests, Female's Voices for the Earth found 89 parts per million (ppm) in Trend Free & Gentle and 63 ppm in regular Tide. They aided raise awareness, and Proctor & Gamble accepted reformulate to reduce ranks to listed below 25 ppm. Future examinations need to demonstrate to whether they made great on that particular assurance. Brighteners: You'll find these in detergents marketing their "lightening up" powers. Brighter whites! Brighter colors! Exactly what's producing all this illumination? Chemicals that really continue to be on the garments to take in UV light and assist clothes "appear" brighter. We're speaking things like naphthotriazolystilbenes (linked with developmental and reproductive effects), benzoxazolyl, diaminostilbene disulfonate, and much more. Because these remain on the garments, they are most likely ahead right into contact with skin. Phosphates & EDTA: Makers make use of these making detergents much more reliable in tough water, and to help avoid dust from kicking back on garments when they're washing. These chemicals have long been associated with ecological damage, specifically in our streams and waterways. They trigger algae blossoms that harm ecological communities. Many cleaning agents have actually gotten rid of these, yet they're frequently making use of ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) in its location, which does not readily biodegrade, and has actually been discovered to be toxic in pet educations. All-natural Alternatives. We do not need to subject ourselves and our families to all these chemicals for tidy garments. There is an option both for the residence customer, and the professional user such as healthcare facilities, laundry mats and hotels. The remedy to a toxic free, chemical free, money conserving laundry has actually been utilized by health centers for several years. Ot is called an ozone laundry system.

2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The American Red Cross is helping at least 4,700 people in dozens of emergency shelters in Louisiana after unprecedented flooding has left 15 rivers in record flood stage. "This is an extremely chaotic situation right now, with life-threatening flood waters, power outages and road closures complicating relief efforts – as many local volunteers have also been directly affected by the flooding," said Brad Kieserman, vice president, Disaster Services Operations and Logistics for the Red Cross. "This is by far our largest sheltering effort in Louisiana since Hurricane Isaac, and the bulk of this staggering devastation is in areas that typically don't experience flooding. The Red Cross is mobilizing a massive relief effort which could be our largest since Hurricane Sandy." Thousands of people have been forced from their homes with little but the clothes on their backs. Red Cross disaster volunteers are opening shelters, providing meals and comfort. Additional volunteers, relief supplies and emergency response vehicles are moving toward Louisiana now to bolster response efforts. "Our work is just beginning, and we will be on the ground for weeks helping people in Louisiana pick up the pieces," continued Kieserman. "Entire families have lost their homes and everything they own, please join the Red Cross in supporting Louisiana by making a much needed financial donation today." Flooding is expected to continue for several days, and once waters recede it will take some time to fully uncover the extent of the devastation. The Red Cross will be working closely with partners in the days ahead to ensure people receive the help they need as quickly as possible. Flooding is also threatening communities in Mississippi, where Red Cross volunteers provided safe refuge to nearly 70 people Saturday night. HOW TO HELP To help people affected by the Louisiana Floods, visit redcross.org, call 1-800-RED CROSS or text the word LAFLOODS to 90999 to make a $10 donation. Donations enable the Red Cross to prepare for, respond to and help people recover from these disasters. FLOODING SAFETY INFORMATION The Red Cross has steps people should follow to remain safe: 1.     Be prepared to evacuate at a moment's notice and heed evacuation orders when given. When a flood or flash flood warning is issued for your area, head for higher ground and stay there. 2.     Stay away from floodwaters. 3.     If you come upon a flooded road while driving, turn around and go another way. If you are caught on a flooded road and waters are rising rapidly around you, get out of the car quickly and move to higher ground. Most cars can be swept away by less than two feet of moving water. 4.     Keep children out of the water. 5.     Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize flood dangers. DOWNLOAD EMERGENCY APP Download the free Red Cross Emergency App to receive emergency alerts and information about what to do in case of flooding and other disasters, as well as locations of shelters. The App also includes emergency first aid information and a Family Safe feature which allows people to instantly see if loved ones are okay. The free Emergency App is available in app stores by searching for the American Red Cross or going to redcross.org/apps.

Patanjali Ayurved will invest Rs 500 crore in four mega shelters for cows across the country. The four ‘gaushalas’ or cow shelters will work on improving productivity of Indian cows up to 10 times. “We are setting up four scientific cow shelters. The first one will come up at Uttarakhand,” Ramdev said. Baba goes bullish Rs 500 crore investment on 4 mega shelters for cows across India 5 food parks in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Assam Nagpur food park to focus on dairy products and protection of cows 10,000 tonnes capacity addition for food products To invest Rs 750 crore in research on ayurveda Meanwhile, Patanjali said it will file defamation case against Advertising Standards Council of India Apart from investing in research on cows, Patanjali has spent Rs 250 crore for research on usage of ayurveda in modern life. It will spend another Rs 500 crore (Rs 5 billion) on research, Ramdev told reporters on Saturday. To ramp up its production capacity, Patanjali is setting up five mega food parks. Land parcels have already been identified and work will start within this year. “We have bought 230 acres of land in Nagpur and 200 acres in Andhra Pradesh. We will set up three food parks in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Assam,” he said. Ramdev said his dream it make Patanjali the largest player in fast-moving consumer goods segment with annual revenue of Rs 50,000 crore (Rs 500 billion). The food park at Nagpur, which is expected to become operational in next couple of months, will focus on dairy business and cow protection. While Patanjali already sells dairy products such as ghee, Ramdev wants to expand both the portfolio and reach. Taking a dig at the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) - the self-regulatory body in the field of advertisement - Ramdev alleged it is targeting Patanjali because it is run and controlled by multinationals. He said Patanjali will soon file defamation case against ASCI. Patanjali has received 27 show-cause notices in recent months from the advertising body. “Its governing members constitute firms like the Hindustan Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive and PepsiCo, among others. ASCI is deliberately targeting us as we have become a major concern for multination firms. When we decided to take legal action against ASCI, it offered us a membership. We are writing a letter highlighting all their wrong-doings to the government of India,” Ramdev said.
