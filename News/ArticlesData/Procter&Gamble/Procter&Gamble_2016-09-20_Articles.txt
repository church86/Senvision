(Photo: The Cincinnati Enquirer) CINCINNATI -- Procter & Gamble’s worldwide manufacturing footprint is set to shrink to the smallest it has been in more than 20 years. The Cincinnati-based company has sold or closed 17 factories around the world – including 12 in the United States – in the last five years. Next month,  eight more P&G plants will become the property of Coty, a company that makes Rimmel makeup and Calvin Klein perfume. P&G executives have assured investors the Coty deal will wrap up its two-year-long brand-selling campaign. But the company appears poised to shutter even more factories. The shift is part of an ongoing drive to improve efficiency and lower costs. Ultimately, it means P&G's signature products, such as Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, will be made in fewer, but larger manufacturing plants, and ones with more robots and automation that reduce personnel. The company has promised Wall Street another $10 billion in savings over the next half decade and has indicated a major piece will come from slimmed-down operations. CEO David Taylor said the cuts could be achieved without a “broad-based (jobs) reduction.” But to execute the plan, P&G is moving production to plants it is expanding with the intention of closing down others. P&G's manufacturing overhaul has coincided with cutting 24,000 jobs worldwide through buyouts, divestitures, layoffs and attrition. Though P&G is hiring factory workers at some sites, nearly 10,000 of the jobs eliminated in the last five years were from its manufacturing network. “Supply chain transformation is in its early stages," Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller told analysts at a conference earlier this month. Right now, P&G is focusing on North America, before shifting in order to Europe, Latin America and finally India, the Middle East and Africa, he said. In the United States, P&G closed factories earlier this year in Augusta, Georgia and Cayey, Puerto Rico; this summer, it announced a chemicals factory in Avenel, New Jersey would close in 2018 and be sold. The company owns three other chemical plants in North America, which are located in suburban Chicago; Sacramento, California; and the Ivorydale campus in St. Bernard. More closures could be announced as P&G prepares next year to open a West Virginia factory that is currently under construction. P&G is spending $500 million on the new facility in Berkeley County, located in the state's eastern panhandle. "P&G is really looking to maximize their efficiency with significant up-front investments in factories, but that means the closure of less-efficient plants in time," said Leon Loewenstine, chief investment strategist at Downtown-based Riverpoint Capital Management. Besides the pending Coty deal, P&G has shed factories through its sale of the Iams pet food and Duracell battery brands. The company is spending a half-billion dollars to build a large factory in West Virginia's Eastern Panhandle and investing millions in expanding other plants. P&G officials say the plant that’s as large as the Kenwood Towne Centre will make Pantene shampoo, Olay body wash and Bounce fabric enhancers as the company emphasizes facilities that can produce a variety of products for different business units. In Utah, P&G officials have said it is spending $500 million to double the size of its paper plant there and add 200 new jobs, but have not disclosed what other products will be made by the super-sized plant. Michael Magazine, a professer of operations and business analytics at the University of Cincinnati, said it's cheaper for a manufacturer to operate larger but fewer factories. It saves money on labor, equipment, utilities, supplies, maintenance and financing. P&G has signaled some of its North American factories will not only survive, but grow. The company’s fabric care plant in Lima, Ohio, about 130 miles north of P&G's headquarters, has already been expanded and the company said the Avenel operations will be consolidated there. Similarly, P&G’s Greensboro, North Carolina plant has picked up work from the now-shuttered beauty brand factory in Puerto Rico. Moeller added that while P&G is spending a lot of money on factories now, savings will come. "We're in investment mode now with savings to ramp up in two, three and four years," Moeller said. The investment in added production North American capabilities comes as P&G has amassed an eye-popping $13.3 billion of cash and securities on its balance sheet, yet its U.S. sales are relatively flat at $27 billion. P&G officials acknowledged the company’s ongoing review of its supply chain but declined to discuss specific potential factory closings for this story.

Last year, P&G sold its Nenagh plant to US cosmetics firm Coty, having operated the facility since 1978. Around 250 staff are employed at the plant and were informed in a staff meeting held in the wake of the sale last year that they would remain as P&G employees until the end of 2016, when the deal is finalised, at which point they will become Coty employees. Following the announced sale, Siptu lodged a claim for a loyalty payment for its Nenagh-based members. The Labour Court has now recommended that workers at the plant receive a one-off loyalty payment ranging from €5,500 to €12,500 each. READ NEXT Firms lose Luas court appeal In its argument before the Labour Court, Siptu said P&G is a multinational that could easily afford to make a satisfactory, once-off gratuity to its Nenagh staff to acknowledge their contribution. Siptu was seeking €2,500 per year of service. P&G said employees’ loyalty has already been rewarded over the years. It said there is no contractual or statutory entitlement to a one-off loyalty payment for staff in a transfer situation, nor is there a custom, practice, or policy in the history of P&G. In its recommendation, the Labour Court noted “the profound effect on the workforce of the proposed transfer of ownership of the business”. It stated that it also noted the need for full co-operation by the workforce to efficiently bring about that transfer. “Finally, the court notes the precedent established in the 2008/09 downsizing agreement, in which compensation for co-operation with change was conceded by the company.” The Labour Court stated that in that context and in return for full co-operation with the transfer of the business to the new owners, it was recommending the company pay a range of amounts to affected workers. It recommended that P&G staff with less than five years’ service receive €5,500; staff with five but less than 15 years’ service receive €8,000; and staff with 15 or more years’ service receive €12,500. The most recent accounts for P&G (Manufacturing) Ireland Ltd, which also operates a plant in Newbridge, Co Kildare, show that it recorded pre-tax profits of €11.68m last year.

Join the Conversation To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Overcoming a life-threatening heart condition Cincinnati 12:20 p.m. EDT September 22, 2016 This content is paid for by a sponsor Lynwood Battle (right) is appreciative of his heart failure team, led by Dr. Greg Egnaczyk, medical director of the Heart Failure Program at The Christ Hospital. (Photo: Provided/The Christ Hospital) Lynwood Battle has never met a stranger. Maybe it’s his smiling eyes or the calm, thoughtful way he speaks that makes him so likeable. Or maybe it’s his engaging manner and humble, grateful attitude. Just ask him and he’ll tell you every moment he has is a gift. He’s got that glass-half-full outlook, but it stems from a purely harrowing experience more than two decades ago. Lynwood was young and healthy. Despite being a little overweight he led an almost storied life. He graduated from The Ohio State University, where he played sousaphone in the marching band and even dotted the “i” in “Ohio.” He earned two Bronze Star Medals in the military. His careers with Procter & Gamble and his family’s mortuary service were ex­ceedingly noteworthy, as was his relentless devotion to his community. Then one day everything changed. Lynwood’s heart malfunctioned. He developed heart failure, where the heart muscle becomes weakened and loses its ability to pump enough blood to supply the body’s needs. Doctors believe his heart failure was triggered by a viral infection. Heart failure affects over 5 million Americans, is one of the fastest-growing heart issues, and is the leading cause of hospitalization in people over age 65. But Lynwood wasn’t 65. Not even close. “I really didn’t know what was in my future,” Lyn­wood said. So he brought his concerns to Dr. Edward J. Schloss at The Christ Hospital’s Heart & Vascular Center. “Dr. Schloss said, ‘We’ll take care of you,’ and I trusted that they would – and they did,” Lynwood said. With a name like Battle, he was ready for a fight. Lynwood began a regimen of medications – a heart failure cocktail – and attended patient education classes. Dr. Schloss put in an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, which shocks the heart back into normal rhythm during life-threatening situations. Lynwood credits that ICD for saving his life many times. “I call it my bionic buddy,” Lynwood laughed. “It has fired appropriately a number of times, and if it hadn’t, well, I wouldn’t be here today.” Lynwood also found a friend and advocate in heart failure specialist Dr. Gregory Egnaczyk. Dr. Egnaczyk reduced Lynwood’s medications and referred him to Cardiac Rehab, where he exercises with the safety net of medical professionals on-site. “When I can’t get in there, I feel there’s something missing from my day,” Lynwood said. He’s lost 100 pounds, now manages his diabetes strictly through diet and exercise, and has reduced the level of his CPAP machine for sleep apnea. Lynwood also attends Heartworks, a monthly educa­tion and support group provided by The Christ Hos­pital, offering patients and their families meaningful information about heart failure and its management. “They listen to you and sometimes you just want to talk about what’s going on,” Lynwood said. Now, thanks to the experts at The Christ Hospital, Lynwood, 73, feels better than ever. He even returned to The Ohio State University where he dotted the “i” for an alumni game, “to do it one more time” – some­thing he thought he’d never do again. “You’re never too old to make a change,” Lynwood said. “Any outcome that adds a minute to your life or gets me to my goal of seeing my grandchildren gradu­ate and get married is worth it.” Dr. Dean Kereiakes  (Photo: Provided/The Christ Hospital Network) Related:  MD Insider featuring Dean Kereiakes, MD Q: What causes heart failure? A: Heart failure (HF) can develop slowly over time as the result of other conditions (such as high blood pres­sure, coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease or viral infections) that weaken the heart muscle. HF can also result from heart muscle damaged during a heart attack. Q: What are the symptoms? A: Many patients first experience fatigue and/or shortness of breath during normal daily activities, which they may dismiss as a sign of aging. Other symp­toms include wheezing or coughing, fluid retention and weight gain, loss of appetite, and abnormally fast or slow heart rate. Q: What is unique about heart failure care offered by The Christ Hospital Physicians? A: We offer a dedicated HF team and specialized unit, The Carl H. & Edyth Lindner Heart Failure Treatment Center, the only in-patient program in the region to focus only on HF treatment. Our program offers ad­vanced care for the entire spectrum of HF, including leading-edge medical management, advanced devices, clinical research trials, and ongoing support for life­style modifications. Q: What’s new in HF treatment? A: Telehealth options are now available to help monitor HF patients at home so they avoid unnecessary hospitalizations or trips to their physician. We also offer advanced device treatments such as Left Ventric­ular Assist Devices (LVAD), an implant that supports the heart in patients waiting for a heart transplant or suffering from end-stage HF. Our program recently celebrated 100 patients living better lives, thanks to our amaz­ing team and technology. New treatments for HF occurring after heart attack include: • Regenerative therapies utilizing a patient’s own stem cells evaluated to repair and/or replace heart tissue damaged or lost during a heart attack. • The novel Parachute™ Device, the first minimally invasive treatment to partition damaged heart muscle from normal muscle, restoring heart function and im­proving quality of life. Q:What advice do you have for anyone suffering from HF? A: Seek care by a specialist focused in HF. Our talented team of HF physicians are easily accessible in locations throughout the Tristate.

Jesus Aranguren/AP View Caption About video ads View Caption of Unilever, the world’s third largest producer of consumer goods, is burnishing its green image. The British-Dutch company announced Monday that it bought Seventh Generation, an eco-friendly cleaning, paper, and personal care product company, for $700 million. The acquisition show the increasing importance of ethics to the consumer market and represents a shift in values toward sustainability for Unilever. “Seventh Generation has long been a disruptor in the US marketplace, leading the industry in sustainable innovation while attracting new generations of conscious consumers,” Nitin Paranjpe, president of Unilever’s home care division, said in a statement. “This addition to Unilever’s product portfolio will help us meet rising demand for high-quality products with a purpose.” Recommended:Earth Day: Are you saving the planet or just showing off? Take our quiz. The sale could give Unilever, valued at $136.2 billion, an advantage in a US market largely held by its rival company Procter & Gamble. Seventh Generation, which made $200 million in sales last year, could now have access to a larger pool of consumers for its increasingly in-demand products.

Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/18 “We look at this as having a multiplier effect for our business,” Seventh Generation Chief Executive John Replogle, who will stay on to run the company, told The Wall Street Journal. “We always aspired to be a billion-dollar brand. We see this as a springboard as opposed to throwing in the towel.” Some are worried about the partnership, as startups don’t always retain their original mission once bought by publicly traded companies. But Unilever has historically taken a hands-off approach when it has acquired new companies – like it was seen to do after it bought Ben & Jerry’s in 2000. Additionally, Unilever acquired the environmentally friendly Dollar Shave Club in July for $1 billion, and is reported to be in talks to buy Jessica Alba’s Honest Company, which sells nontoxic household products. The acquisition of companies aimed at environmentally conscious buyers symbolizes a dramatic turnaround for Unilever, which in 2008 was accused of contributing to the destruction of the Borneo Rainforest in Indonesia by buying palm oil, a key ingredient in many processed food and personal care products, from companies that engaged in illegal deforestation. At the time, Unilever was the largest purchaser of palm oil in the world.  The advocacy group Greenpeace led a campaign against Unilever's participation in the rainforest destruction, which was seen as causing harm to native people and wildlife. Unilever responded by dropping contracts with the palm oil producers in question and lobbying its competitors Kraft, Nestlé, Cadbury, Cargill, and Proctor & Gamble to do the same. "Unilever's decision could represent a defining moment for the palm oil industry.” John Sauven, Greenpeace executive director, said in a statement in 2009.  "What we're seeing here is the world's largest buyer of palm oil using its financial muscle to sanction suppliers who are destroying rainforests and clearing peatlands. This has set a new standard for others to follow." In the years since, Unilever has been involved in efforts to promote sustainable palm oil production and it was Unilever's commitment to reducing its environmental impact that made the Seventh Generation CEO to say that the two companies would make good partners. “Today marks the next chapter and we’re proud to join Unilever and its shared vision for purpose-led business on a global scale,” Replogle said in a statement. “Working together we are confident we can have a positive impact on the health of billions of people around the world, truly fulfilling our mission of nurturing the next seven generations while transforming global commerce.” Next up Earth Day: Are you saving the planet or just showing off?

Frankie Bridge reveals she works out EVERY DAY as she shows off her honed figure in a new beauty campaign Frankie told FEMAIL that hanging out with her boys makes her happiest Revealed she tries to work out every day and eats a clean diet Says being a mum makes her think about what’s worth worrying about By Bianca London for MailOnline Published: 03:57 EST, 21 September 2016 | Updated: 04:09 EST, 21 September 2016 e-mail 50 View comments She's become one of the most successful female British pop stars after finding fame with S Club Juniors but you're more likely to find Frankie Bridge cuddled up at home with her children than on the red carpet these days. The 27-year-old, who has two young sons with her footballer husband Wayne, told FEMAIL that hanging out with her boys makes her feel at her happiest.  'It's the little things that make me feel super these days,' she said. 'Like simply hanging out with the boys, getting to spend quality time with them is so special, especially as they’re growing up and we’re getting to see how funny, cheeky and lovely they are.'   Frankie Bridge, who is supporting the Superdrug and P&G FeelSuper Campaign, which raises funds for Marie Curie, shows off her honed figure in the campaign shoot - and shares her workout secrets with FEMAIL Frankie, who found fame as a child, says that motherhood has 'massively' changed her life and the concept of being 'busy' has totally changed as a result.  She explained: 'I now have two little boys to think about all the time and they’re always the first thing I think about when planning our week, or work schedules or anything! I always thought I was busy before but now as a mum, still working, I realise that this is busy.  'Being a mum is amazing though, it really makes you think about what’s worth worrying about and what isn’t.'

Share this article Share Frankie, who put on a glamorous display at London Fashion Week this weekend, says that while she has less time to go to glamorous parties now, it does actually make her them appreciate more. 'I now get to be a mum not really caring about what I look like when out with the boys, and then I get to dress up and get glam for a fun night out. I really appreciate that I get to have both – I love being a mum at home and I love getting glam,' she said.  Frankie, who found fame as a child, says that motherhood has 'massively' changed her life and the concept of being 'busy' has totally changed The star, who still speaks to The Saturdays girls 'all the time' in their Whatsapp group, has also been keeping busy filming a documentary about internet trolls Frankie certainly knows how to get her glam on; she worked a thigh-grazing mini-skirt which cinched in her tiny waist to flaunt her hourglass figure to it's fullest at the Jasper Conran show. So what's her secret? 'Wayne and I give each other an hour a day or every few days to each go to the gym while the other stays with the boys,' said Frankie, who swears by Pilates classes, boxing with friends and TRX. She also follows a clean diet, opting for natural yogurt with granola and berries for breakfast followed by around an hour’s workout, a salad for lunch and then a stir fry for dinner. The star, who still speaks to The Saturdays girls 'all the time' in their Whatsapp group, has also been keeping busy filming a documentary about internet trolls after meeting some victims who had been targeted online.  Frankie is mother to two-year-old Parker, left, and Carter, right, and says being a mother is what makes her feel at her best She explained: 'With a team I then tracked down the trolls and confronted them about the things they’d said/things they’d done to see how they’d react when confronted face to face.  'The result was exactly what you would expect – none of the attackers had any justification for their actions and tried to shy away from the damage they had done. By joining the team, I was hoping to show victims that they shouldn’t be scared of these trolls.  'It’s so nice that I’m in the position where I get to try lots of different things and have a go at things I’ve never done before. Filming the documentary was a real first and I enjoyed doing something with a serious topic.  'I’ve been in music since I was 12 so it’s great that I now have the opportunity to branch out a little. It also means that I have more time at home with the boys which I love and that I have time to help real causes like this one. 'The Feel Super is campaign is all about raising money for the amazing work Marie Curie nurses do for terminally ill patients and their families. Last year we raise £200,000 which is enough to fund 10 nurses, this year I’ve once again teamed up with P&G and Superdrug to raise even more. 'It’s also really simple to get involved so I don’t feel like I’m asking a lot. People can help Marie Curie simply by buying the everyday beauty products they’d be buying from Superdrug anyway so it’s so easy to donate!'  Frankie explained that she follows a clean diet, opting for natural yogurt with granola and berries for breakfast followed by around an hour’s workout, a salad for lunch and then a stir fry for dinner   Share or comment on this article e-mail Most watched News videos Autistic boy bursts into tears on stage as teacher snatches microphone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Good pup!

The Gamble House, a living, untouched example of the Arts and Crafts Style, is celebrating 50-years since its owners donated the landmark estate for preservation. Tonight, guests will celebrate at a party on the grounds and preview a new documentary about the House produced by longtime Disney producer Donald Hahn (The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, more). Then on September 25, The Gamble House will host a public party with $1 tours, food and entertainment for all. The turn-of-the-century estate represented one of the finest examples the Arts and Crafts Movement when completed and lives as a historic landmark to this day. “There’s no way that this house could be truly reproduced today. It’s not for lack of the craftsmen. It’s the materials that existed 120 years ago are simply not available today. That’s what really makes this a special place and so important to conserve exactly as it is,” says Gamble House Director, Ted Bosley. Architects Charles and Henry Greene created the Gamble House in 1908 for David and Mary Gamble of Ohio as a winter residence for the heirs to the Proctor and Gamble household products fortune. The 8,000 square foot house took ten months to build for approximately $50,000 at the time. “It was really on the high end at that time,” said Bosley. “What Charles and Henry Greene brought to this place was a very personal expression of their ideal in building and design.” The house would remain under ownership of the Gambles until the surviving members of the family deeded the house to the city of Pasadena in a joint agreement with the University of Southern California School of Architecture in 1966 after realizing the artistic importance of the house as a surviving example of Greene and Greene, according to the Gamble House website. “There is so much detail and so much care focused on every corner of this house that it’s the kind of place that rewards repeat visits. It’s a very personal expression of architecture. It was a total work of art,” said Gamble House Director Ted Bosley. The Gamble family donated the home and all the furnishings along with it, as they were originally crafted for the project. “It’s the only Greene and Green house that remains today with all of its furnishings,” explained Bosley. ‘What’s really remarkable is that more than one hundred years later we have just about exactly what the Gambles walked into in 1909.” The unique details that are appreciated not only for the complexity of its time, but also for the originality it presents, are seen in every square inch of the property. “The way the wood is chosen for function and the decorative woods that are used—all of those are expressed very distinctly. It really does end up being a total work of art, a symphony of wood,” said Bosley. Greene and Greene implemented their personal style that was both functional and modern and almost entirely comprised of wood. “The architects felt that it was important to let natural materials speak in their own language—to show their natural characteristics,” said Bosley who explained that the wood was only treated with light finishes and never painted. The house features many kinds of wood including Douglas fir for the structure; Burmese teak in the entry hall and the living room, the kitchen boasts maple wood and sugar pine countertops, Honduran mahogany in the dining room and California redwood panels in the living room. “Thoughtful details like that were always in the minds of the architects as they were designing these rooms and choosing the woods that were most appropriate for the various functions,” said Bosley. The Gamble House was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1978 and has since become a premier historic site in the nation. It is open to the public and also offers specialty tours and programs. The 50th Anniversary public celebration kicks off Sunday, September 25th from noon to 4 p.m. at the Gamble House at Number-4 Westmoreland Place. Tickets are available first come; first serve on site the day of the event.

P&G shrinks factory footprint Alexander Coolidge , acoolidge@enquirer.com 5:57 p.m. EDT September 20, 2016 Buy Photo Procter & Gamble's headquarters in downtown Cincinnati. (Photo: The Enquirer/Cara Owsley)Buy Photo Procter & Gamble’s worldwide manufacturing footprint is set to shrink to the smallest it has been in more than 20 years. The Cincinnati-based company has sold or closed 17 factories around the world – including 12 in the United States – in the last five years. Next month,  eight more P&G plants will become the property of a company that makes Rimmel makeup and Calvin Klein perfume. P&G executives have assured investors the Coty Inc. deal will wrap up its two-year-long brand-selling campaign. But the company appears poised to shutter even more factories. The shift is part of an ongoing drive to improve efficiency and lower costs. Ultimately, it means P&G's signature products, such as Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, will be made in fewer, but larger manufacturing plants. Procter & Gamble CEO David Taylor  (Photo: Provided) The company has promised Wall Street another $10 billion in savings over the next half decade and has indicated a major piece will come from slimmed-down operations. CEO David Taylor said the cuts could be achieved without a “broad-based (jobs) reduction.” But to execute the plan, P&G is moving production to plants it is expanding with the intention of closing down others. P&G's manufacturing overhaul has coincided with cutting 24,000 jobs worldwide through buyouts, divestitures, layoffs and attrition. Though P&G is hiring factory workers at some sites, nearly 10,000 of the jobs eliminated in the last five years were from its manufacturing network. “Supply chain transformation is in its early stages," Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller told analysts at a conference earlier this month. Right now, P&G is focusing on North America, before shifting in order to Europe, Latin America and finally India, the Middle East and Africa, he said. In the United States, P&G closed factories earlier this year in Augusta, Georgia and Cayey, Puerto Rico; this summer, it announced a chemicals factory in Avenel, New Jersey would close in 2018 and be sold. The company owns three other chemical plants in North America, which are located in suburban Chicago; Sacramento, California; and the Ivorydale campus in St. Bernard. More closures could be announced as P&G prepares next year to open a West Virginia factory that is currently under construction. P&G is spending $500 million on the new facility in Berkeley County, located in the state's eastern panhandle. "P&G is really looking to maximize their efficiency with significant up-front investments in factories, but that means the closure of less-efficient plants in time," said Leon Loewenstine, chief investment strategist at Downtown-based Riverpoint Capital Management. Besides the pending Coty deal, P&G has shed factories through its sale of the Iams pet food and Duracell battery brands. Buy Photo  (Photo: Enquirer file) P&G bulks up some plants, cuts others and uses robots The company is spending a half-billion dollars to build a large factory in West Virginia's Eastern Panhandle and investing millions in expanding other plants. P&G officials say the plant that’s as large as the Kenwood Towne Centre will make Pantene shampoo, Olay body wash and Bounce fabric enhancers as the company emphasizes facilities that can produce a variety of products for different business units. In Utah, P&G officials have said it is spending $500 million to double the size of its paper plant there and add 200 new jobs, but have not disclosed what other products will be made by the super-sized plant. "We're constructing multi-category manufacturing sites in geographically strategic locations to replace smaller single-category sites," Moeller told analysts this month at the Barclays Back-to-School Consumer Conference. Moeller added P&G is also P&G is automating production at the plants it is keeping to lower labor costs. He said the company is "aggressively expanding the application" of "collaborative robots" that now pack cases of product and wrap pallets for shipment. The company is also testing automated (self-driving) fork lifts. Michael Magazine, a professer of operations and business analytics at the University of Cincinnati, said it's cheaper for a manufacturer to operate larger but fewer factories. It saves money on labor, equipment, utilities, supplies, maintenance and financing. If a company chooses to run fewer plants, one critical issue is to create the capability to make all different products necessary, Magazine said. Another trick, is the right location: close to suppliers that provide necessary raw materials and close to customers who buy the end product. "If you have more plants, you can move closer to your customers and you can be more specialized," Magazine said. "But if you can be flexible and switch production to produce different products, you don't need as many factories and you can save money." P&G has signaled some of its North American factories will not only survive, but grow. The company’s fabric care plant in Lima, about 130 miles north of P&G's headquarters, has already been expanded and the company said the Avenel operations will be consolidated there. Similarly, P&G’s Greensboro, North Carolina plant has picked up work from the now-shuttered beauty brand factory in Puerto Rico. Moeller added that while P&G is spending a lot of money on factories now, savings will come. "We're in investment mode now with savings to ramp up in two, three and four years," Moeller said. The investment in added production North American capabilities comes as P&G has amassed an eye-popping $13.3 billion of cash and securities on its balance sheet, yet its U.S. sales are relatively flat at $27 billion. P&G officials acknowledged the company’s ongoing review of its supply chain but declined to discuss specific potential factory closings for this story. Buy Photo  (Photo: Enquirer file) Company has virtually no manufacturing locally Cincinnati has seen this before. At the start of the millennium, Procter was in crisis. Sales growth was stalled, the stock had plummeted, CEO Durk Jager was ousted and investors were unhappy. Jager’s successor, A.G. Lafley, turned the company around through the sales of slow-selling brands and cost-cutting, then investing the proceeds into faster-growing core operations. As part of this round of brand sales and cost-cutting, Lafley all but completely dismantled P&G’s ownership of its iconic Ivorydale manufacturing complex. The local Crisco plant became part of J.M. Smucker in the 2002 spin-off of the shortening brand; investment group Twin Rivers Technologies bought the Olestra fat substitute operations in 2002; and in 2003, the soap-making operation was sold to a Canadian manufacturer, Trillium Personal Care, which took over Ivory and Safeguard production on a contract basis. Those deals left P&G with ownership of just a small chemical factory at Ivorydale – once the company’s largest complex. The local operation makes glycerin and employs 90 manufacturing workers.

The British-Dutch company announced Monday that it bought Seventh Generation, an eco-friendly cleaning, paper, and personal care product company, for $700 million. The acquisition show the increasing importance of ethics to the consumer market and represents a shift in values toward sustainability for Unilever. “Seventh Generation has long been a disruptor in the US marketplace, leading the industry in sustainable innovation while attracting new generations of conscious consumers,” Nitin Paranjpe, president of Unilever’s home care division, said in a statement. “This addition to Unilever’s product portfolio will help us meet rising demand for high-quality products with a purpose.” Recommended:Earth Day: Are you saving the planet or just showing off? Take our quiz. The sale could give Unilever, valued at $136.2 billion, an advantage in a US market largely held by its rival company Procter & Gamble.

Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/18 “We look at this as having a multiplier effect for our business,” Seventh Generation Chief Executive John Replogle, who will stay on to run the company, told The Wall Street Journal. “We always aspired to be a billion-dollar brand. We see this as a springboard as opposed to throwing in the towel.” Some are worried about the partnership, as startups don’t always retain their original mission once bought by publicly traded companies. But Unilever has historically taken a hands-off approach when it has acquired new companies – like it was seen to do after it bought Ben & Jerry’s in 2000. Additionally, Unilever acquired the environmentally friendly Dollar Shave Club in July for $1 billion, and is reported to be in talks to buy Jessica Alba’s Honest Company, which sells nontoxic household products. The acquisition of companies aimed at environmentally conscious buyers symbolizes a dramatic turnaround for Unilever, which in 2008 was accused of contributing to the destruction of the Borneo Rainforest in Indonesia by buying palm oil, a key ingredient in many processed food and personal care products, from companies that engaged in illegal deforestation. At the time, Unilever was the largest purchaser of palm oil in the world.  The advocacy group Greenpeace led a campaign against Unilever's participation in the rainforest destruction, which was seen as causing harm to native people and wildlife. Unilever responded by dropping contracts with the palm oil producers in question and lobbying its competitors Kraft, Nestlé, Cadbury, Cargill, and Proctor & Gamble to do the same. "Unilever's decision could represent a defining moment for the palm oil industry.” John Sauven, Greenpeace executive director, said in a statement in 2009.  "What we're seeing here is the world's largest buyer of palm oil using its financial muscle to sanction suppliers who are destroying rainforests and clearing peatlands. This has set a new standard for others to follow." In the years since, Unilever has been involved in efforts to promote sustainable palm oil production and it was Unilever's commitment to reducing its environmental impact that made the Seventh Generation CEO to say that the two companies would make good partners. “Today marks the next chapter and we’re proud to join Unilever and its shared vision for purpose-led business on a global scale,” Replogle said in a statement. “Working together we are confident we can have a positive impact on the health of billions of people around the world, truly fulfilling our mission of nurturing the next seven generations while transforming global commerce.” Next up Earth Day: Are you saving the planet or just showing off?

Business Gideon Spanier: Ad giants forced into U-turn as they find out too much targeting has a downside Gideon Spanier Tuesday 20 September 2016 15:34 BST Olympic gymnast Simone Biles has a Tide deal with P&G EMMANUEL DUNAND/AFP/Getty Images One of the great debates taking place in advertising at the moment is whether companies should use precision targeting or mass marketing to reach consumers. The logic of precision marketing has become seductive. We live in an online era where it’s possible for an advertiser to target customers in almost unlimited ways — by age, sex, location, personal interests, type of device, past behaviour and so on. It means that, at last, there is a solution to American department store mogul John Wanamaker’s notorious refrain that “half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don’t know which half”. Except advertisers are discovering that targeting too much carries its own risks and that “wasting money” on advertising beyond a brand’s target audience might actually be a good idea. The U-turn has been led by the world’s biggest advertiser, Procter & Gamble, maker of Tide washing powder, Fairy washing-up liquid and Pampers nappies, which has found that moving a lot of its marketing budget into targeted Facebook ads has backfired. “We targeted too much, and we went too narrow,” P&G chief brand officer Marc Pritchard confessed last month. The danger of targeting too much is that a brand loses fame and relevance. It ceases to be visible to the wider public and stops having a cultural impact. McDonald’s has just shut its YouTube channel because it realised “we weren’t reaching enough customers”, as its chief marketing officer Alistair Macrow put it. The lesson is that smartphones and laptops may be a great way to generate “direct response” — getting a loyal customer to purchase something — but they are far less effective at building a brand and winning new customers. There is a reason why, for example, every time Apple launches a new iPhone, it books the best outdoor poster sites, prime-time 30-second TV spots, and full-page ads in newspapers. Apple doesn’t just want to appeal to core fans. It wants its products to be famous and to reinforce their premium status. Last year, the iPhone maker increased its ad budget by 50% to $1.8 billion (£1.4 billion). None of this means that online advertising and the use of digital data are ineffective. The hottest media agency to launch in London this autumn is Hearts & Science, which is making use of shopper marketing, e-commerce and customer behaviour data to inform its clients’ media plans. P&G, the advertiser that now wants to target less, was Hearts & Science’s founding client in the US. As we look at how media consumption is changing, we know that the distinction between online and traditional media is already blurring — to the point where it could soon become irrelevant. What we see and hear on television and cinema screens, outdoor poster sites and radio stations, is going to be delivered digitally and in real-time (in an environment where we might pay attention, rather than allow the intimate confines of our smartphone screen to be invaded). Then the distinction that matters to advertisers becomes not the method of delivery but the ability to have mass, simultaneous reach. For advertisers, there is a simple choice: Be famous or be invisible.   More about: Advertising Business Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: All Topics All Authors Archive Terms of use Contact Us Privacy policy Cookie policy Code of Conduct & Complaints Advertisers Promotion rules Contributors Syndication Business Connections Homes & Property Jobs London Live The Independent This is London Magazine indy100 Install our apps Close We have noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

PackML evolution PackML gets a little help from OPC UA Machine safety: Hardwired E-stop not dead yet Remote monitoring vs. security Sidebar: Weihenstephan Standards define communications between machines and MES Sidebar: Machine HMI design issues: Engineer, artist, linguist? Today, machine builders are creating hardware and software that communicate with the rest of your plant equipment plus your shop floor MES and ERP systems. When something breaks, chances are the machine can tell you exactly where the problem is and how to fix it. If that’s not possible, your machine builder can log onto the machine and find the fault within minutes—no travel time and no expenses. You’re back up and running. Back at headquarters, senior staff has been following the event, and immediately knows the impact on production and can adjust accordingly. Futuristic? Not really—it’s available right now. FE talked with machine builders, system integrators (SIs) and component suppliers to get a handle on what food and beverage processors can expect with the latest and future generations of machine controls. It turns out that several improvements in technology have been occurring at every level, including faster processors, cheaper and more dense memory and industry-standard machine programming and communications protocols. With these improvements, machine safety has been evolving from hardwired switches and separate safety controllers to integrated safety systems. And cybersecurity is as good as your bank’s. Sidebar: Weihenstephan Standards define communications between machines and MES Dating back to 1999 and founded and developed by the Technical University of Munich (TUM), Chair of Food Packaging Technology, the Weihenstephan Standards (WS) are popular in the beverage filling & packaging industry (WS Pack), and increasingly in the food processing industry (WS Food), and provides the link between the production management level and the machine level. WS consists of standardized data using WS production data and the WS communication protocol (WS-proprietary commands used with the TCP/IP protocol). Additionally, WS supports the ISA TR88.00.02’s (OMAC PackML) mode manager and state model. Per the Weihenstephan Standards website: “The Weihenstephan Standards (WS) define a universal communication interface for the connecting machines to higher ranking data acquisition systems or MES (Manufacturing Execution systems). They also define the data which must be provided for acquisition. Data points and contents were defined for individual industrial sectors. Up to now libraries for bottling and packaging plants (WS Pack) and machines for food processing (WS Food) have been realized.” Communication via a plug-and-play principle is made possible by automated parameterization via a device description file. Moreover, the Weihenstephan Standards give recommendations for the data evaluation (e.g., traceability, calculation of efficiency identification numbers, technical reporting) and for the approval and the safe operation of MES implementations. Source: Siemens Energy. PLC or PAC: Does it really matter what it’s called? The heart of any machine is its controller(s), which used to be the PLC. In many respects, the PLC has evolved, and the result is a single device, the programmable automation controller (PAC), which not only handles standard logic (off/on) functions, but also can provide motion/position control, robotics supervision and process control while connecting to Ethernet networks and real-time sensor/actuator networks. These capabilities are provided within an architecture, often resembling a PC, and either exist on the “motherboard” itself or through the use of plug-in cards. “This convergence of automation and IT technologies provides all the functionality needed from a PLC, while adding a wealth of other features in one programming environment,” says Bob Trask, Beckhoff Automation senior systems architect. These features include integrated motion control, kinematics, condition monitoring, programmable safety and HMI. “In the near future, we see vision and predictive maintenance functionality being implemented,” Trask adds. “[Our] TwinCAT3 automation software adds programming in Visual Studio, maximized performance for multi-core PC-based controllers and IoT [Internet of Things] solutions for easy-to-implement connectivity to the cloud.” The tools are already there, and Beckhoff is working hard to implement these IoT tools in such a way that the user does not need to be an IT expert. Has the PLC given way to the PAC? While there are applications that are better suited to either the PLC or PAC, demand for the PLC has not wavered nor has the technology been forsaken, says Bill Dehner, AutomationDirect application engineer. “In fact, a better question to ask would be: Has the PAC given life to the PLC? To that, I’d say absolutely. Many of the features desired with a PAC are now being incorporated into the industry-proven PLC. Advanced PLCs today have bigger user memories, more communication, more data storage, more integration, more remote accessibility, and are more reliable than ever before.” “PAC features are permeating the PLC world,” says Don Pham, IDEC product manager. “For example, even micro PLCs now include features that were only found in PACs as recently as a few years ago.” IDEC’s MicroSmart FC6A PLC provides PAC power with fast programming speeds, high-capacity programming and data memory—and an ability to handle up to 126 analog I/O. IoT capability is provided with custom web pages that can be configured for remote monitoring and control. “One solution for easier integration and decreased time to market is a single, scalable control platform that supports the requirements of complex, batch manufacturing processes and high-speed packaging equipment,” says John Dart, Rockwell Automation senior industry consultant. “Manufacturers should look for machine controls that can be applied across a wide range of equipment types and complexity, and integrate across a plant-wide network. This scalability and consistency can help manufacturers increase productivity and reduce ongoing operating and maintenance costs.” Rockwell’s iTRAK system controls, for example, provide mechatronic solutions to packaging systems that allow for flexibility and independent control of multiple movers on straight and curved paths. “Siemens controllers met all the requirements of the PAC long before the PAC name was created,” says Tim Parmer, factory automation - marketing, Siemens Industry. “Therefore, we have chosen to continue to refer to our hardware/software components as ‘controllers.’” The SIMATIC range of controllers comprises basic, advanced, distributed and software controllers, offering scalability and integration of their functions. # SEW-Eurodrive’s controls portfolio contains PACs, which are called “MoviPLCs,” says Rainer Neufeld, electronics manager. These PACs are available in different performance levels. “We combine optimally scalable controller hardware with easily programmable motion control software. Our continuous control program covers extensive motion functions: from single-axis positioning and electronic cams to robotics,” adds Neufeld. Whatever you call it, the move to open architecture systems is on, and machine builders have enjoyed the benefits of a wide range of controls. “We use open architecture software, such as Allen-Bradley, to allow for easy integration with other line components while giving plant technicians the ability to support and own their system versus ‘black box’ systems,” says Greg Jacob, general manager at Allpax Products, maker of retorts. However, he adds, PLC systems are still the preference, primarily due to plant history and support comfort level. Polytron, a member of the Control System Integrators Association (CSIA), provides hardware and software as part of a turnkey system, though it’s not a controls product distributor, says Scott Richards, senior project manager. “We work with many of the major automation platforms, including Rockwell Automation, Bedrock Automation, Wonderware, GE Proficy/iFIX, Siemens, Omron and others. Most PLCs would now be referred to as PACs due to their increased capabilities and features.” Bühler Aeroglide makes convective conveyor thermal processing equipment, e.g., dryers, ovens, roasters, impingement ovens or coolers, etc. According to Pei Li, senior electrical engineer, “We provide a range of machine control hardware options to control our equipment. This includes common PLC platforms, which interface to Windows-based industrial PCs. We also offer more traditional HMI/PLC solutions as necessary. In our machine control area, we have not seen a demand from our clients for PAC. Furthermore, we believe the PAC is more complex and not as robust as PLCs.” For JLS Automation, builder of robotic-based picking solutions for primary and secondary packaging applications, advanced PLC control has made design simpler. President Craig Souser notes, “We are migrated to what I call a complete machine control—PLC/Motion/HMI all running on the same platform within the same program. Advancements in motion control have made us comfortable in elimination of a standalone robot control system.” Sidebar: Machine HMI design issues: Engineer, artist, linguist? HMI graphic design is really an art form. To make a good HMI, one needs to think about the true user of the machine, the operator, and how he or she interacts with that machine every day of its life. First, engineers program the machine. They know every technical nuance in the machine and have intricate knowledge of how the machine works. So the engineer often creates an HMI for himself and not the machine’s operator. The result is a lot of buttons and technical jargon that make perfect sense to the engineer, but go way over the operator’s head. Second, most engineers are not artists. There is an entirely different set of skills needed to understand graphics, layout, color schemes—even the type of button that should be used for a certain action. Most engineers will use whatever the HMI software’s defaults are for a button or a color because that is the easiest and fastest way to complete the project. Engineers are very reliant on the HMI software vendor. If that software is not well designed, or it’s difficult to use, the programming effort may end with a sub-par HMI. The result—HMIs that all look similar in appearance. As a test, visit PACK EXPO this year and see how many HMIs use a dark blue button with white text. Third, there is a matter of time and cost. I can say first hand, that I can easily spend more time working on an HMI than I will in writing the PLC program. If an engineer wants to make nice graphics, he or she should be prepared to spend a lot of time working in a graphics program tweaking icons, scaling graphics and picking colors that work well for a specific machine. I also believe that every error of a machine should be brought out to the HMI with enough information for the end-user’s team to be able to fix the machine. One of our goals at Axon is to never force someone to access code because they cannot figure out a problem with help from the HMI. Finally, using multiple languages in an HMI can be very challenging. As the language changes (say, from English to Spanish), the text size and length vary and cause readability issues. Typically, an engineer doesn’t have the benefit of knowing abbreviations in a foreign language if he isn’t fluent in it. So, during the course of the design project, an engineer will go back and forth between languages for every screen, making sure everything fits and works. At Axon, we work with a translation company that specializes in machine translation. This is important because a lot of words, like “HOLD” for example, could mean to carry something or to pause the machine. Working with a translator that understands these differences and nuances helps to ensure language translation makes sense to the end user. —Christopher Thomas, Axon Corp. PackML evolution Today, it’s all about communications and getting important operational data to those who need it. “It’s hard to go a day without hearing the words, Internet of Things or Industry 4.0,” says Christopher Thomas, director of controls technology at Axon Corp., a division of ProMach. Axon builds shrink and stretch sleeve packaging machines. “At the heart of these initiatives is the desire to access the wealth of data that is available in PLC- and PC-based machines and turn that data into actionable information,” adds Thomas. Lately, the use of Industrial Ethernet on the plant floor is bridging the gap between the operational technology (OT) and IT networks. Ethernet is available on almost any controls, which makes machine-to-machine and line control easier to implement. As this trend continues, Thomas says the ease to integrate machines from different technology vendors will increase. “In the food and beverage industry, we expect to see less reliance on specifications naming a sole source vendor and instead more emphasis on specifying an interface [such as PackML] to connect machines,” adds Thomas. “We believe that this trend will drive innovation, better machine design and reduce cost for the end user.” “We have seen a tremendous global growth with customers—OEMs, SIs, EUs [end users]—requiring ISA TR88.00.02 [OMAC PackML]-based solutions,” says Mike Pieper, industry manager - packaging, Siemens Industry. “This is due to the demand of global EUs [i.e., Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Nestlé, Arla Foods, etc.] requiring operational consistency between all OEM machinery [consistent programming modes and states, common naming of KPI tags] and higher-level systems [line overview, OEE, MES, etc.] with OEMs looking to harmonize their various machines, reduce engineering cost, leverage reusable and modular code and minimize commissioning.” “Forward-looking machine and equipment builders see their products lasting 10 or 20 years,” says Richard Clark, InduSoft Wonderware Schneider-Electric application and process engineer. “These builders are actively pursuing PackML as a machine/process standard so their machines can interface and integrate into larger process environments as the customer’s production grows.” What are the alternatives for not pursuing PackML? Clark says either manually modifying and integrating the old, non-standard equipment into the larger automated production process or obsolescing the old equipment. “PackML can mitigate complexity and establish standards-based machine operation,” says Beckhoff’s Trask. “A benefit of PackML is the PackML state machine, which defines standard modes of operation within the manufacturing process. The PackML state machine, when properly implemented, provides a common look and feel to the basic operation of a machine,” adds Trask. “This is a proven benefit to the OEM and the end user. What is the machine doing? Why is it in this state? The OEM does not have to create this [code] from scratch, and the end user does not have to figure out what the OEM has programmed.” “In the four years that I have been working with PackML, I personally have seen a continuous growth and interest in PackML on the part of machine OEMs and end users,” says Thomas. One drawback is the current lack of an implementation guide to help those interested in PackML to get started on a project and to know what the main deliverables should be for a PackML machine. Fortunately, there is a guide in the works from the OMAC group, which got its start with automation standards in 1994. “PackML is a terrific development,” says Mike Grinager, VP of technology for Brenton Engineering, a Pro Mach business. Brenton makes end-of-line packaging equipment such as cartoners, case packers, palletizers, etc. “However, it is a development that will take its own time and path through the packaging industry, and it will evolve.” There will not be, strictly speaking, only one PackML. For example, a number of Brenton’s Fortune 100 customers have their own internal versions of PackML. These versions could be described as dialects of PackML, which are optimized for these large companies’ environments. “PackML has a number of positive attributes for OEMs in terms of lowering engineering overhead and allowing the OEM to be more productive,” adds Grinager. “Customers may not even be aware when they receive a machine [where the] PackML standard was utilized.” While PackML is not a monolithic development soon to be on everyone’s shop floor, it is a powerful tool to be used when and where it is most appropriate. PackML gets a little help from OPC UA “While PackML provides a common look and feel to a machine or production process, getting this information out to the decision-makers and plant personnel requires a secure, vendor- and OS-independent transport mechanism such as OPC UA [Unified Architecture],” says Beckhoff’s Trask. OPC UA, as a transport mechanism on top of TCP/IP, moves key data to decision-makers and plant personnel. “OPC UA offers built-in security and data encryption, and is ideal for exchanging data both horizontally with other machines on the floor and vertically into the cloud for access anywhere in the world,” adds Trask. “This adds valuable and tangible benefits for concepts such as ‘Smart Factory’ and ‘Industry 4.0.’” The biggest challenge today with PackML is the lack of a standard communication protocol defined to allow communications with a machine no matter what control system is being used, says Axon’s Thomas. While a machine has an Ethernet port, this doesn’t guarantee any level of compatibility. Most major technology vendors have their own specific protocol, which typically doesn’t cross over to other vendors. This is where a universal protocol like OPC UA is needed. “We are watching closely the development of OPC UA in the industry and believe OPC UA will be the great equalizer for manufacturers as it addresses so many pressing needs and is not specific to any vendor,” adds Thomas. Travis Cox, co-director of sales engineering at Inductive Automation (provider of Ignition software), sees the interoperability issues with equipment and software as a really hot topic of concern. “If the device is proprietary and requires specific software for programming or visualization, it will become an isolated silo of data. Devices should use open standards, such as OPC UA or MQTT, which allow interoperability.” MQTT (fka MQ Telemetry Transport) is an ISO standards-based, publish-subscribe system, which is a lightweight messaging protocol for use on top of the TCP/IP protocol stack. MQTT requires a message broker, which is responsible for distributing messages to clients requesting a specific message topic—e.g., a certain process temperature or reject info. Machine safety: Hardwired E-stop not dead yet Machine safety is, of course, a big deal. No one wants a warning or fine from OSHA. It used to be that an E-stop switch was hardwired such that hitting it would stop a machine, or an interlock switch would stop a machine or immediate section of it when a door or panel was opened. It also used to be that a parallel controller or PLC known as a “safety PLC” would run in conjunction with the main process controller, being able to shut down the equipment when a process or machine was progressing towards dangerous limits. Today, E-stops and interlocks are moving away from hard wired power interrupters to safety-based software solutions that receive a signal from a sensor, switch or other computed value, then shutting down the correct apparatus. But now a safety PLC can potentially reside on the same rack, chassis or board. How safe are these changes? What is the design philosophy for safety-rated systems? Can operators be prevented from “cheating” the interlock system? “The large manufacturers are now beginning to standardize to Category 3 safety requirements, which include a special ‘safety PLC’ to provide redundant back-up controls and emergency stop scenarios,” says Allpax’s Jacob. “In addition, fencing with OSHA-approved gate permissive controls for entry, light curtains and physical machine guarding continue to evolve in required specification scope documents.” For systems where E-stops or interlocks are activated via a touchscreen, there’s a method to protect people from getting their hands into operating machinery, says Tim Donaldson, Progea North America sales manager. “Multi-touch with two buttons on a screen to [stop] it. This will ensure both hands are not inside the machine.” “We design safety as an integral feature in all of our systems,” says Polytron’s Richards. “We also offer safety risk assessments and safety mitigation for existing equipment. A properly designed safety system will be very difficult for an operator to override; at a minimum, such bypasses would be documented and alarmed. Modern safety systems utilize software as well as redundant wiring. We make no distinction that software-based systems are somehow less safe. If that were the case, we would never use them.” “Software-based solutions can actually [ensure a] higher level of safety as it’s more difficult to override if implemented properly,” says JLS Automation’s Souser. “Drive-based safety is much faster and more distributed so that makes for a safer solution.” “Machine-based risk analysis and mitigation plans are critical to engineering safety,” says Doug Beloskur, automation manager at Bühler Aeroglide. “Based on our mitigation strategy, we can design safety systems to lower the risk of personnel injury and machinery damage. In mind of simplicity, we utilize hardwired interlocking for electrical means of risk mitigation. We make efforts to design out major hazards up front to eliminate the need for safety PLC systems.” Beloskur also says that providing as much safety-related information to operators as possible, which can be accomplished through audible and visual warnings, is extremely important. Operator training is an absolute necessity so the right safety decisions can be made to protect operators and machinery, and this also includes well placed safety labels on all equipment. “Lastly, regarding software-based emergency stops,” continues Beloskur, “we do not believe this is reliable enough or yet acceptable by our customer standards.” Remote monitoring vs. security Remote access/monitoring would seem to be at odds with security, but if implemented properly, remotely viewing operations or equipment can bring dividends—both from production and maintenance (remote troubleshooting) standpoints. “Operations personnel want remote access because it means faster, easier problem resolution,” says Brenton’s Grinager. “The IT department typically does not want to grant remote access because so much in the plant is linked back to the MRP system. It is a big problem, and both sides have valid points.” “Maintaining line efficiency is super critical for plants to hit their budgeted goals for line production,” says Allpax’s Jacob. “Monitoring machines to report efficiency and resolve downtime scenarios is very valuable. Line efficiency gains typically far outweigh monitoring costs and make ROI justification an easy decision.” Some processors are still reluctant to allow monitoring and servicing remotely on their machines, but this has been slowly changing over the years, though it’s still an uphill battle for machine builders. “It is our belief that most customers want the technology, but there is a lot of concern over security and the awareness of friction with the IT department anytime these requests are made,” says Axon’s Thomas. Axon offers a remote monitoring and service package called ProTech by Pro Mach with its machines, which allows troubleshooting without sending a technician to the site, incurring further costs. This gets customers back up and running faster. “It is our hope that as the use of Industrial Ethernet grows, the IT and OT networks will begin to work much better together, and this will open the door for remote monitoring and access,” says Thomas. Today, OEMs have the technology to make remote monitoring safe. “We depend on the security of the plant network to safeguard individual machinery,” says Bühler’s Pei Li. “However, we understand the need for remote access of our machines from time to time. In these cases, we utilize VPN connections to gain access.” For further security, this OEM’s equipment offers customizable user-level security to suit each client’s needs. JLS Automation takes monitoring beyond just the typical equipment sensor data. “We equip all of our machines with remote access and are offering cameras to monitor lines. We work with the end customer to help them troubleshoot, and in more and more cases, this is the operator and not maintenance. We are looking to embed videos in our HMI to facilitate the training of new operators to a machine.” While you might think security issues only concern themselves with hackers breaking in and destroying equipment, probably the more relevant concern is leakage of intellectual property—and not necessarily through hacks. SEW’s Neufeld explains: “There is still an acceptance problem when it comes to letting other companies supervise production equipment. On one hand, everyone wants the quick support and in-time diagnosis; on the other hand, no one wants fact(s) such as production speed or quality to be known outside the company. SEW understands this dilemma, and our answer has been to offer diagnosis that can be used remotely—but only if the operator allows it.” Finally, at the plant level, a tiered password structure maintains security. At the network level, the OEM and the processor’s IT department need to coordinate so that both groups understand the needs and requirements of the other, says Grinager. Virtual private networks (VPNs) linking only the machine, or an island of machines, back to the OEM is the current state of the art. Are VPNs secure? “Some VPN hardware and software combinations mirror the same high level of security one finds in the banking industry,” says Grinager.

But if you’re working at Flipkart, Larsen & Toubro, Procter & Gamble, InMobi and Amazon, among others, you might just get a free chopper ride this Diwali. These industry giants are trying their way best to woo their employees and give them the best Diwali of their lives. royaltyluxurylimousine Chopper rides, gourmet testing, or a tree house stay instead of the conventional mithai will entice a lot of people this year. You think of it and they’ve got it. The companies have also shown interest in offering dinner on a yacht with family, pizza making session in a luxury hotel for kids, exclusive movie screening for the entire family or the opportunity to record your own song are also on the table. According to a Chennai-based firm BI Worldwide, the entire approach to offering people rewards is associated with the memory. As much as 70% of decisions are driven by emotions than the brain and when employees are given such benefits, they tend to remember it for a longer time. prostatecanceruk “Companies have understood that the rewards efficacy is measured by creating lifetime memories, which have a high re-consumption value every time that memory is shared or recalled, against cash incentives that are short term,” said Siddharth Reddy, CEO at BI Worldwide. “We are consciously designing experiences. The idea is to gift memories to good performers as part of a long-term retention strategy,” said Manoj Biswas, human resource head at Larsen & Toubro. L&T plans to offer wine yard tours, tree-house stays, skydiving and gourmet testing sessions to employees in the coming festival season. They’ve further explained that the average budget doesn’t exceed 10,000 and in return, they get a lot of acknowledgement from spouses and children. cooknwithclass “Gifting a movie ticket or cash is passé. says a spokesperson from InMobi. The new way is to give them experience that they can remember and surprise them by customised vacations; from beer festivals in Berlin to a trip in Bali or Europe. It’s true that employees don’t remember the amount of bonus given to them—it’s usually lost in everyday life, but an experience like this stays. Every time the person would see those pictures or remember the moment, he is bound to go back to the awesome time. This way, you earn a great performer for life.  2.1k facebook twitter reddit Comment Here Follow @indiatimes Our Channels News Lifestyle Entertainment Health Videos Sports Trending Sections india world sports weird self style Tech who we are travel food bollywood celebscoop hollywood Healthy Living Recipes Inspire Tips & Tricks Buzz Photogallery Indiatimes Lifestyle Network MENS XP iDiva Luxury Ask Men Pursuitist Specials #FRONTLINES #GOFORGOLD #INDIANAMA Other Sites News – TO CricBuzz Happy Trips Business Insider ZoomTv Gizmodo Lifehacker IGN BoxTV Gaana Online Shopping Techradar Daily Deals Gitanjali Shop Satvik Shop WHAT'S HOT ZigWheels FILMIPOP Filmfare Femina Mobile Greetings Follo Jobs Property Astrology Speaking Tree Matrimonial iTimes Ads2book TcNext Romedy Now About us Mobile Apps ARCHIVES sitemap Contact us ABOUT INDIATIMES Privacy Policy Terms & CONDITIONS Copyright © 2016 Times Internet Limited.

Maybe doorman. The uniform is beautiful and that is what people are probably expecting of me.” Addressing the holding company’s recent losses, especially on the media side, he admitted that Publicis has yet to make up for that missing revenue. As evidence of a comeback, he cited the HP Enterprise win we broke last month, but that client only spent $13.6 million in the first quarter of this year, so it’s not quite P&G. Now who will replace him, again? Lots of people are saying Arthur Sadoun, though Campaign also floats Steve King of Publicis Media and Allan Herrick of Sapient.Nitro. (It’s going to be Sadoun. Calling it now, so put us down for $3.50.) We also hear of some fairly big internal changes coming to the Publicis Communications organization … but something tells us you will be disappointed anyway. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

While you were sleeping: Fed signals December hike Margreet Dietz Thursday September 22, 2016 Share Play NBR radio on US stocks and longer-dated debt rose, while the greenback weakened, after the Federal Reserve kept its target interest rate unchanged but signalled a hike later this year. "The committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened but decided, for the time being, to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives," the Federal Open Market Committee says. Three officials – Esther George, Loretta Mester, and Eric Rosengren – voted against keeping the fed funds rate steady, each of whom preferred to raise the target range a quarter point to between 0.5 and 0.75 %. Shorter-dated US government debt fell while 10-year Treasuries rose, reflecting expectations that investors are toning down bets on Fed rate hikes further down the road. "Our decision does not reflect a lack of confidence in the economy," Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen said at the start of her press conference, Bloomberg reported. "Since monetary policy is only modestly accommodative, there appears little risk of falling behind the curve in the near future." Yields on the 10-year note fell two basis points to 1.67%, while yields on two-year notes rose two basis points to 0.79%. "That really stands out that they've become significantly more dovish in their projection materials, but clearly trying to signal to the market that December is very much live," New York-based Credit Agricole head of fixed-income strategy David Keeble told Bloomberg. "It's looking very likely we'll get one this year, but after that it goes flat." Wall Street also moved higher. In 2.56pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.5%. In 2.41pm trading, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index climbed 0.5%. Investors are positioning for a rate increase at the end of the year. "The body language makes it sound like they're warming people up for December," Stephen Massocca, chief investment officer at Wedbush Equity Management in San Francisco, told Reuters. The Dow advanced as gains in Chevron and Boeing shares traded 1.5 % stronger, outweighing declines Procter & Gamble and Walt Disney shares, down 2.1% and 1.1% respectively. Shares of FedEx were up 6.8% at 3.08pm in New York, after the shipping company upgraded its full-year earnings forecast, and offered an upbeat outlook on the impact of its acquisition of TNT Express. "The integration of TNT Express is proceeding smoothly, and the level of team members' engagement is outstanding," Frederick Smith, FedEx chief executive officer, says. "Managing our operating companies as a portfolio of customer solutions helped FedEx achieve strong financial and operating results in the quarter, especially given global economies continued low growth." In Europe, the UK's FTSE 100 Index eked out a 0.1% gain, Germany's DAX index added 0.4%, while France's CAC 40 index rose 0.5%. (BusinessDesk)   Got a question about this story?

Eric Volkman (TMFVolkman) Sep 21, 2016 at 12:49PM What happened? Unilever (NYSE:UL) is going the green route with its latest acquisition. The global consumer goods company announced this week that it has agreed to purchase privately held Seventh Generation, a maker of eco-friendly household products. Neither the price nor the terms of the deal were disclosed. However, a report in Fortune, citing "a source familiar with the deal", said that the purchase price is between $600 million and $700 million.  Image source: Seventh Generation.  In the press release announcing the acquisition, the president of Unilever's home care business characterized its asset-to-be as "a disruptor in the U.S. marketplace", adding that "[t]his addition to Unilever's product portfolio will help us meet rising demand for high-quality products with a purpose." Does it matter? Seventh Generation products enjoy good visibility, occupying plenty of shelf real estate in American stores. According to Unilever, the private company's sales topped $200 million last year, with compound annual growth in the double digits over the past decade. A more promising figure is the company's sales structure -- around 95% of its revenue is derived from North America. Under the Unilever umbrella, Seventh Generation has the potential to grow much larger as its new parent company pushes to make the brand the default green option in markets all over the world. Owning Seventh Generation boosts Unilever's overall competitiveness against eternal rival Procter & Gamble. In contrast to Unilever's recent acquisition activity, Procter & Gamble has been shedding assets instead of acquiring them. Despite that, Procter & Gamble has been the better-performing stock of late, rising by over 11% year-to-date compared to Unilever's 7% gain. News of the Seventh Generation deal comes on the heels of speculation that Unilever is interested in pursuing The Honest Company, another green products purveyor. Whether or not a deal for that company is in the cards, it's obvious that Unilever is serious about beefing up its product lines in this niche. Seventh Generation, with its past success and its future potential, seems like a sensible move in that direction. Eric Volkman has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Brooklyn, New York-based retailer Matt Mazzone’s idea to sell chocolate for charity has been a huge hit. It started out local, and sweetened into a national program whereby Ace stores across the country have generated more than $600,000 for Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals. For his leadership, his fundraising and his community involvement, Mazzone is the 2016 Ace All-Star Retailer. "... Giving back to our communities is something ingrained in our DNA.”"I am truly humbled and honored to be named the 2016 All-Star Retailer, and would like to give credit to my incredible team,” said Mazzone, owner of Mazzone Ace Hardware in Brooklyn. “I think I speak for Ace retailers across the organization when I say that giving back to our communities is something ingrained in our DNA, it is done without expectation of recognition or award.” This national award honors one Ace retailer annually for his or her extraordinary fundraising, leadership skills, innovation and commitment to Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals  – Ace’s national philanthropy of choice. Mazzone was nominated by his local CMN Hospital, Cohen Children’s Medical Center. The co-op says Mazzone was selected for his exemplary fundraising for Cohen Children’s Medical Center and his efforts to influence and engage Ace stores across the country to fundraise for Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals. The idea to use World’s Finest Chocolate Bars as a fund raiser – an idea that took off across the co-op – led to the sale of 1.2 million bars, generating more than $600,000 for CMN Hospitals across the country in just 16 months. In addition, Mazzone hosts an annual Pumpkinfest event for his store’s neighborhood community. This fun-filled event has become a local tradition for many families with proceeds benefitting Cohen Children’s Medical Center. The event includes pumpkin decorating, pony rides, face painting, music, food and raffles. As part of Mazzone’s recognition, P&G and Duracell will donate $25,000 in his name to Cohen Children’s Medical Center. In addition, Cabot Creamery will host Mazzone on their 2017 Cabot Community Celebrity Cruise to Alaska. Like Ace, Cabot Creamery is a cooperative that believes in rewarding influential leaders like Mazzone for their contributions to communities and society. “I would like to thank our store associates, my fellow Ace retailers, the Ace Foundation team, and Ace’s management for their encouragement and continued support of Children's Miracle Network Hospitals,” said Mazzone. “We are proud to recognize Matt Mazzone as Ace’s third-annual All-Star Retailer,” said Kane Calamari, president of the Ace Hardware Foundation. “Not only has Matt been instrumental in raising funds for his local hospital, Cohen Children’s Medical Center, but he has also been a visionary catalyst within our organization spurring incredible fundraising growth across the entire Ace enterprise.” Login or Register to post a comment. ﻿ Newsletter Sign Up Get the latest news sent to your inbox   Product Video Network Spray Nine Heavy-Duty Cleaner + Degreaser + Disinfectant What makes Spray Nine a triple threat?

The nation’s second largest retailer highlighted CHEP and IFCO in its 2016 Sustainability Report. By replacing more single-use packaging and platforms with reusables, Kroger aims to meet or exceed the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s zero waste threshold of 90% diversion from landfill in its facilities by 2020. “Kroger is committed to being a positive force for change when it comes to sustainable business practices, and CHEP and IFCO play an important role in our effort to meet our zero waste goals and continuously improve the sustainability of our supply chain,” said Suzanne Walker-Lindsay, Kroger Director of Sustainability. Kroger’s sustainability report states, “Kroger partners with CHEP and IFCO, which both contribute to global sustainability through their ‘shared’ business models of pooled pallets, bulk containers and reusable plastic containers (RPCs). These packaging solutions bring both operational efficiencies and environmental benefits. Compared with one-way packaging, reusable platforms and containers offer a lower carbon footprint, reduced water consumption and less waste.” In addition, Kroger notes its use of RPCs for fresh produce improved product quality and reduced waste by eliminating the use of more than 73,000 tons of waxed and corrugated boxes. “We are committed to providing our customers with sustainable solutions that help them make their supply chains more efficient and environmentally friendly,” said Juan Jose Freijo, Global Head of Sustainability for Brambles. “Kroger is a valuable partner and we are pleased to contribute to their zero waste vision. Those companies working together on common goals will be the ones with the greatest impact on environmental sustainability.” CHEP and IFCO supply chain solutions provide clear environmental benefits versus alternatives. For example, Kroger’s commitment to CHEP pallets avoided more than one million pounds of solid waste and eliminated 430 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2e), the equivalent of growing more than 41,000 trees for 10 years.[2]  Separately, production of IFCO RPCs requires 65% less water and 34% less energy than one-way packaging. In addition, the use of IFCO RPCs results in a 31% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and an 85% reduction in solid waste versus single-use cardboard boxes.[3] Kroger, CHEP and IFCO are also members of the Consumer Goods Forum, whose members have committed to reducing food waste by half within retail and manufacturing operations by 2025, while also contributing to the United Nation’s 2030 food waste reduction goals. Mr. Freijo concluded, “We look forward to continuing our partnership with Kroger and other retailers and manufacturers to reduce the environmental impact of the fast-moving consumer goods supply chain and to help preserve our natural resources for future generations.” [1] National Retail Federation, 2015. 2 CHEP Sustainability Calculator. 3 Comparative Life Cycle Assessment of Reusable Plastic Containers and Display- and Non-Display-Ready Corrugated Containers Used for Fresh Produce Applications, Franklin Associates, March 2016  ### About CHEP and IFCO: CHEP is a global provider of supply chain solutions serving the consumer goods, fresh food, beverage, manufacturing and retail sectors in more than 60 countries. CHEP offers a wide range of logistics and operational platforms and support services that are designed to increase performance and lower risk while improving environmental sustainability.

Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock Is Screeching to a Halt The 7 Best Tech Stocks in the World View All Posts Whenever Mark Cuban gives an interview, you’ll always be entertained. He’ll inevitably say something controversial — yet insightful. But then again, Cuban is a true American super entrepreneur. During the dot-com heyday, he sold Broadcast.com to Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) for a cool $5.7 billion. From there, he invested in other ventures — and, of course, bought the 2010-11 NBA champion Dallas Mavericks. As of now, Cuban now has a net worth of about $2.5 billion. In a recent talk with The Wall Street Journal, he — as expected — did not pull any punches. First of all, he took shots at the concept “buy and hold.” According to Cuban, it’s a good way to waste your hard-earned money. In an era of high-frequency trading, investing looks more like a casino, right? Cuban also thinks the more sophisticated idea of “asset allocation” is another big loser. This is a fancy way to divide your assets across stocks, bonds, commodities and other categories — with the goal of getting diversification. But in a global marketplace, securities prices actually have become more correlated, making it tougher to reduce the overall risk in a portfolio. So what does Cuban recommend? In a sense, it is about going back to the principles of legendary investor Peter Lynch. That is, you should invest in companies you really understand. Often this means avoiding high-fliers like LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) and Pandora (NYSE:P) and instead focusing on stalwarts like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Proctor & Gamble (NYSE:PG). However, Cuban always wants to get things at dirt-cheap prices. To this end, he still is waiting for the market to dip even more. As should be expected, Cuban’s words have stirred up some crumbling from Wall Street power players. Just take a look at John Bogle, founder of The Vanguard Group. Basically, he thinks Cuban’s investment ideas are, well, dangerous. Bogle is a firm believer in the idea that investing is about looking to the long haul. And yes, this means divvying up assets across different categories. Let’s face it, can the regular investor effectively time the market? Is it possible to take on the world’s top hedge fund managers? Probably not. So while asset allocation is far from perfect, it still is a pretty good strategy. Despite all this, Cuban’s views still are worth noting. That is, there still are great opportunities to buy stocks that ultimately might become the next Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) or Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). But again, it means truly understanding the company’s products and competitive advantages — as well as the long-term growth potential.

When pseudo-logic is everywhere, emotion is what breaks through Sep 20, 2016 Bruce Philp   (Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty) Baseless provocation has become big business in politics lately—take Brexit and the improbable candidacy of Donald Trump for two particularly vivid examples—and, if they have any sense, marketers are taking notes. The Donald has proven to have a particularly sick genius for whipping up a crowd, with his trademark mix of belligerent non sequitur and naked pandering. Its appeal doesn’t seem broad enough to get him elected, but it’s certainly enough to make people pay attention, and that’s a hot commodity these days. Donald Trump's anti-trade rhetoric exposes deep rifts in the global economy Pundits now anguish over our “post-factual democracy,” in which people’s politics aren’t rooted in principle anymore. If voters aren’t being even slightly cerebral about the destinies of nations, will they be any more so when it comes to toothpaste and canned soup? That may seem like a leap, but brands have fed on the zeitgeist since forever. Ad people like to believe that they create the public’s tastes and moods (when they’re not “disrupting” them), but it’s usually more a matter of paddling around on their intellectual surf boards, searching for a cultural wave they can profitably ride to the beach. These days, though, maybe for the first time ever, they’re plying the wrong ocean. While keynote speakers bluster about awesome products, and smug digerati busily codify consumer behaviour, those very consumers are developing an antagonistic distrust of objectivity, or what passes for it. We’re competing in emotional times, now, and reason has become obsolete. Though the debate over emotional versus rational advertising is as old as the martini, rationality’s days have been numbered for some time. Its origins are found in the industrial age, when the whole of corporate might was thrown at finding new consumer problems to solve. But socks can only get so white, and cabs only so easy to hail. It’s inevitable that consumers would turn their attention to more profound themes when it came to choosing brands. Marketers should have been ready for that, but nobody was ready for today’s seething frustration. This isn’t evolution, it’s insurrection. Finding it increasingly difficult to distinguish between nuance and prevarication, people are raging against even having to try. Nobler minds can ponder what this means for democracy—but marketers should still be paying attention. If there’s no distinction between claims and lies anymore, then the only truth people will trust is the one they feel. And they’ll soon bring that bias to the mall, not just the voting booth. Consider: 20 years ago, the ad campaign judged most effective in America was about the perils of switching dog food. This year, it was moms advocating for gun control. Canada’s effectiveness champ two decades ago was a new flavour of mouthwash; this year, that same gun control–campaign shared top honours with P&G, which turned buying feminine hygiene products into an act of political defiance. When pseudo-logic is everywhere, feelings are what break through. How a crisis of morality is slowly killing marketing Turning a brand into a social cause is risky business. Most corporations are already short on moral authority, even before you add in the profit motive. But this is a good moment to look up from our spreadsheets and remember that consumers are human. It’s easy to criticize people for abandoning reason and making choices from the heart, especially if those choices seem bonkers. They’re not fools, though; they’ve simply fallen back on ancient instinct to cope with an over-marketed, amoral world. Which means that, if we’re not careful, claims-based advertising (30% more peanuts in every bite!) can inadvertently make things worse instead of winning people over. Ads are supposed to provoke. Even if your snack food is never going to save the world, it’s no longer an option to ignore how consumers feel about where it fits in their lives, or how they want it to. It’s no longer an option to be indifferent to their vanities, their insecurities, or their aspirations, because those things may be the last, best way to earn their attention. To coin a phrase, if we want to make advertising great again, we need to get more empathetic, not more clever.

At 14:15 IST, the barometer index, the S&P BSE Sensex was down 127.68 points or 0.45% at 28,506.82. The Nifty 50 index was currently down 46.40 points or 0.53% at 8,762. Weakness in global stocks weighed on sentiment on the domestic bourses. The Sensex lost 153.97 points or 0.53% at the day's low of 28,480.53 in mid-afternoon trade, its lowest level since 15 September 2016. The barometer index rose 64.31 points or 0.22% at the day's high of 28,698.81 at the onset of trading session. The Nifty lost 49.10 points or 0.55% at the day's low of 8,759.30 in mid-afternoon trade, its lowest level since 16 September 2016. The index rose 8.05 points or 0.09% at the day's high of 8,816.45 at the onset of trading session. In overseas stock markets, European and Asian stocks edged lower as investors awaited the outcomes of separate policy meetings of the US Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan (BOJ). The BOJ begins a two-day monetary policy meeting today, 20 September 2016. The central bank will conduct a comprehensive review of its stimulus programme after failing to reach its 2% inflation target. Investors are divided on what steps the central bank will take. Some expect that the BOJ will push back additional easing steps, while making its government bond buying more flexible to steepen the yield curve. Others expect the BOJ to launch fresh stimulus through a further push into negative territory and increased asset purchases. The central bank had kept its pledge to increase the monetary base at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen and left the interest rate unchanged at minus 0.1% at its July 2016 meeting. Policymakers also decided to increase the annual exchange-traded equity funds purchase target to 6 trillion yen from the previous 3.3 trillion yen. US stocks registered tiny losses yesterday, 19 September 2016, after a choppy session, with telecommunications shares lagging. The US Federal Reserve policy makers begin their two-day policy meeting today, 20 September 2016. The Fed is expected to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged in the wake of recent downbeat US economic indicators. The Fed left the target range for its federal funds rate unchanged at 0.25% to 0.5% for the fifth time during its July 2016 meeting.

Being married to an ex-banker, however, meant considerable travel and breaks in her career (Ms Shah happens to be the spouse of Manish Shah, co-founder and CEO of BigDecisions.com, a company owned by News Corp, which is also the owner of the publisher of VCCircle.com). In her experiences as a mother living abroad, the baby centre she went to did not cater to the needs of Indian mothers. That’s where the idea for First Moms Club (FMC) came about. The idea behind setting up the community was to enable Indian mothers to connect back to their roots. “I found a lot of small town moms, and moms abroad who wanted to connect with being Indian,” explained Shah. While the small town mothers wanted to know what was happening in the metros, the NRI moms wanted to go back to their roots. “It grew organically. When the community grew very large, I realised there was a lot of potential,” she added. Established in 2010, FMC started out as a community on Facebook with 20 members and has till date added 50,000 users on the platform. FMC launched the beta version of its app on the Google Play Store and the App Store in April this year, which has garnered 5,000 downloads, so far. The app’s open market release is set for early October. “FMC stands out from the other communities. It is not a parenting website or a blog, where it’s a one way traffic, like a panel of experts or blogger telling users what to do. It’s a platform for women to come together and (share their experiences),” said the former Mudra Communications executive. Besides an online community, FMC engages with mothers offline by organising events. It had its first event in 2014 called Momentum on International Women’s Day, and has also organised a children’s literature festival. Besides such gatherings, it also organises bazaars where women entrepreneurs can sell their wares. One of the platform’s main features is a corner where women can share any problems they are facing, anonymously. Here, they speak about medical issues, problems with mothers-in-law, career decisions, how to deal with family situations and even serious issues on domestic violence and child sexual abuse. Ruchita Dar Shah developed First Moms Club from just a Facebook community in 2010 to a full-fledged networking site for mothers FMC, operated by Ruchita Rambles Services Pvt. Ltd, relies on brand partnerships as it main source of monetisation. The platform has done promotional campaigns for brands such as Huggies and Pampers, “Sometimes the promo is for the launch of a new product or for mompreneurs and small businesses. Conventional advertising is expensive. Communities become a cheaper way to reach the mother,” explained Shah. The venture is set to receive its first round of funding and will focus on partnering more with brands. FMC will also become a platform for brands to conduct their research. “We did this thing with Huggies where they came out with a product and we sent it out to 20 mothers on our community and then got feedback. There was a GPS tracker for kids and we did a contest. The mothers tried it out for three weeks and gave feedback,” explained Shah. Such initiatives have been successful for brands because they get real feedback from their consumer base. Besides brands, FMC is exploring monetisation streams through user-generated video, a loyalty programme for mothers, where they will receive benefits and discounts, and also launch e-books. Four years ago, FMC tied up with an NGO AngelXpress for a toy donation drive for the children. The firm is now in the process of tying up with Mattel to provide a toy for each child. Other players in the space include mycity4kids, Tiny Step and Baby Chakra to name a few. Mycity4kids is a content platform that helps mothers discover resources and events for their children and also connects users with mommy bloggers and parenting experts. Its main revenue stream is that of brand tie-ups through sponsored content on its website. Baby Chakra, founded in 2014 provides listings around baby activities such as events, playschools, day care centres, wellness activities and education in various packages. It monetises through commissions from online marketplaces such as Amazon and Flipkart for transactions carried out through the Baby Chakra portal. Like this report?

Survey says millennials to blame WATE Staff Published: September 21, 2016, 8:19 am Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) KNOXVILLE, TN (WATE) – When it comes to how Americans use soap, it’s fair to say millennials are making a clean sweep of it. Bar soap sales are going down the drain. Many Americans are ditching bar soap in favor of its liquid counterpart. According to information from consumer research Mintel, young people between 18 to 24 are largely snubbing the old-fashioned bar of soap, leading to sales declines for the likes of Ivory’s iconic 125-year old bar and its bar soap rivals. The survey shows older folks who still buy bar soap are men 60 years and and older. Between 2014 and 2015, sales of traditional bar soap — which account for roughly 30 percent of soap, bath and shower product sales — slumped by 2.2 percent, says Mintel. That occurred at the same time that soap and shower product sales rose by 2.7 percent. Liquid body soaps accounted for 47 percent of all sales in the soap, bath and shower product category and were valued at $2.7 billion. The preference for liquid soap is largely based on a perceived “ick” factor of using bar soap to wash up. As younger consumers and women snubbed the traditional bar in favor of liquid soap, what’s driving the generational shift? The survey shows that millennials believe bar soaps are covered in germs after they are used. Some health authorities, like Minnesota’s Department of Health, are now recommending a switch to liquid soap noting that germs can grow on bar soap and spread infections. Mintel found that about half, 48 percent, of Americans think bar soap is covered in germs after use. Among millennials, that percentage jumps to 60 percent. Meanwhile, among Americans ages 65 and older, just 31 percent think that bar soap holds germs. Liquid soap has something else going for it: a convenience factor that allows companies to sell new products at a higher price. Companies like Procter & Gamble and Unilever are constantly tweaking their products to develop new ones to appeal to young consumers. It may be no surprise that liquid soaps, and in-shower moisturizers, have a much higher price tag than the traditional bar of soap.

Rochester, NY, September 21, 2016 --(PR.com)-- Printing Impressions magazine announced that Diamond Packaging won three awards in the 29th annual Gold Ink Awards competition, the industry's most prestigious print competition. Winners were chosen from nearly 1,000 entries submitted within 50 different categories. Entries were judged on print quality, technical difficulty, and overall visual effect. Diamond won a Pewter Award in the “Calendars” category, for its 2016 calendar, which marks the 25th anniversary of a long-standing company tradition. The grandfather clock theme, with its inner mechanisms perfectly balanced, represents the collaborative and precise nature of Diamond’s work. The calendar was converted utilizing Clearwater Paper Candesce® SBS paperboard and offset printed with four color process inks, UV matte coating, and UV gloss spot coating. The dimensional header features a multi-level embossed and debossed woodgrain pattern, and a striking clock face insert enhanced with UV gloss spot coating, cold foil, and multi-level embossing, creating a dramatic sense of texture and depth. It also incorporates an opening APET rigid window panel and foil embossed chimes that artfully simulate a real grandfather clock. The middle backers also feature a multi-level embossed woodgrain pattern, and three unique sets of foil embossed gears enhanced with UV gloss spot coating. Metal Magic provided all of the embossing dies. The tightly-registered foil accents, which lend authenticity to the piece, were achieved using state-of-the-art, in-line cold foiling technology. They also showcase the type of decorative effects that can cost-effectively elevate customers’ brands. Diamond won a Pewter Award in the “Folding Cartons” category for Elizabeth Arden’s 5th Avenue Only NYC carton. The carton was converted utilizing metallized polyester board and printed with UV flexo fuchsia purple, dense black, and opaque white offset inks, in-line with DiamondTouch soft touch coating, UV matte, and UV gloss spot coating. High gloss embossed accents on the front panel provide a stunning contrast to the interlaced matte and spot UV gloss pattern surrounding it. The combination of color and textures reinforces 5th Avenue as a prestige brand, and beautifully complements the primary container – a glass bottle with tall clean lines, purple color palette, and gold infused cap. Diamond won a Pewter Award in the “Folding Cartons” category for L’Oreal USA’s Matrix Oil Wonders promotional packaging. The carton was converted utilizing KapStone Kraftpak® high-yield, low density paperboard and printed with UV flexo white, opaque white, four color process, and dense black inks, in-line with UV varnish. Printed opaque white dots provide a perfect counterpoint to the brilliant gold foil stamped dots, creating dimension and visual interest. Gold foil surrounds the die cut windows, framing the hair care products within and drawing attention to the free product sample inside. The interplay between the unbleached paperboard and foil accents create shimmering metallic effects that are very unusual for a kraft-type folding carton. All of Diamond’s winning entries were manufactured using 100% clean, renewable wind energy and produced in a Zero Manufacturing Waste to Landfill (ZMWL) facility.

Scroll down for video   NO QUESTIONS: Neither Bill Clinton nor Chelsea Clinton have hosted a press conference, nor did they walk a red carpet, where journalists had limited access to special guests  One of the basement rooms where reporters are being kept is ready for a press conference, but neither Bill nor Chelsea Clinton have hosted one  That is only one of the draconian restrictions on reporters at the event, which is not holding a press conference. Bill Clinton has answered questions only in specially-arranged interviews, and Chelsea Clinton has answered none at all.  On Tuesday the ex-president used one of two television interviews he has given, with CNBC's Becky Quick, to boast of his charity that it 'put it all out there'. But in reality, neither Clinton has taken a single question from a journalist during or between the CGI's sessions. They did not even walk the red carpet, where reporters could ask a limited number of questions Monday night. Reporters are kept in a basement room between 'plenary sessions' and can only go upstairs if they're chaperoned by a press handler, who put them in roped off areas away from the delegates.   Journalists are barred from entering the confab's specialty lounges, with a staff member standing guard at the door making sure no yellow press badges enter.  The press area includes a press conference room, but no press conferences had been scheduled as of the conclusion of day No. 2.  In years past, celebrities and Bill Clinton himself have come downstairs, answered questions and greeted press.  Rocker Jon Bon Jovi, pictured walking the Clinton Global Initiative's 'blue' carpet, refused to address the criticism being lobbed at the Clinton Foundation or talk about the election. Bill and Chelsea refused to go near the red carpet. Last night, guests were treated to an open bar, while reporters were herded between the press area and an awards ceremony  Clinton Global Initiative attendees had the option to sip red or white wine from sippy cups as they watched an awards program, where press was corralled  When DailyMail.com tried to ask one of the biggest stars at the event, the aging rocker Jon Bon Jovi, about Donald Trump and Republicans' criticism of the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative his handler, and then the singer himself, shut it down.  'We'll move on to the next question,' Bon Jovi's handler told Dailymail.com.  'I'm not here for that,' the rock star said. 'Good try though.' When a foreign reporter asked a follow-up, Bon Jovi also refused to respond.   Of the four dinners taking place in New York City on Tuesday night as part of CGI, the press are banned from three. One of the dinners became news on Tuesday when Donald Trump's campaign and Republicans took issue with one of the speakers, Palestinian teacher Hanan al-Hroub, whose husband was convicted of a terror attack that killed six Israelis in 1980.  Trump's campaign called it 'deeply disturbing,' which was was echoed by the Republican National Committee's Raj Shah. Don't ask, she won't tell: Chelsea Clinton has answered precisely zero questions from journalists despite her father claiming the organization is 'transparent' RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next It's Bill's Party!

Share this article Share 200 shares 'In the wake of this weekend's attacks, granting a platform to the spouse of a terrorist bomb-maker just miles away from where explosives were detonated days ago is an insult to the victims and makes a mockery of the Clinton Foundation,' Shah said in a statement to the Wall Street Journal.  Dailymail.com was told that the dinner was closed to the press - and the Clinton Global Initiative blamed the dinner's sponsor for the secrecy.  'Topic Dinners are hosted by CGI sponsors; they are not usually open to press, except at the discretion of the host organization,' explained a staffer for CGI.  The sponsor in this case is the Varkey Foundation, which is a charity run by Sunny Varkey, who founded and is the owner of GEMS, a chain of private schools around the world. GEMS paid Bill Clinton $5.6 million, which started after he was named honorary chairman of the Varkey Foundation, then known as the Varkey GEMS Foundaiton. DailyMail.com asked about press access at CGI overall and is still waiting for a response. Journalists are also banned from covering a Procter & Gamble-sponsored dinner featuring Chelsea Clinton and former Talk magazine editor Tina Brown entitled, 'Tackling Gender Bias in the Media Through the Power of Advertising.' Procter & Gamble has yet to respond to a request for comment.   The restrictions make an apparent mockery of Bill Clinton’s claim that his charity is as transparent as possible.  But they're not a new part of covering the Clinton Global Initiative. Two years ago, the New York Times' Amy Chozick memorably recalled being escorted to the ladies' room by a 20-something press aide.  'She waited outside the stall in the ladies’ room at the Sheraton Hotel, where the conference is held each year,' Chozick wrote of the flack.  This year reporters can find the bathroom on their own - but only if they go solely to the bathroom and do not dare to try to access other areas. 'Lounges' for other guests are off-limits and DailyMail.com was refused entry to one. Read more: www.nytimes.com/...

WIRE How Airbnb Is Helping the Clinton Foundation Break the Glass Ceiling The foundation plans to invest more than $70 million in women, and Airbnb is pitching in with free lodgings. By Tess Townsend Tess Townsend reports on tech and startups for the San Francisco bureau of Inc. She previously reported for The Day, an independent regional paper in Connecticut. Her work has appeared in The New York Times, Politico, and the now-defunct Bay Citizen. @Tess_Townsend Staff reporter, Inc.com@Tess_Townsend WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Women are healthier and better educated than they used to be, but somehow that hasn't translated into the expected surge of economic progress. That's according to a recent report by the Clinton Foundation, as cited by Fortune. The magazine reports the foundation is partnering with 20 businesses and nonprofits and investing $70 million in women in a bid to close that gap. The foundation anticipates efforts will impact more than 900,000 people in 60 countries, according to Fortune. One of the businesses involved in the initiative is Airbnb, which is offering free accommodations through the platform to 160 small business owners and activists who are women. The idea is that covering these accommodation costs will make it easier for these women to attend conferences and networking events that can help them advance their careers. It's about the hosts, too. Female hosts in some parts of the world are disproportionately entrepreneurial. "Airbnb execs have found that women hosts tend to re-invest the money they earn from hosting guests to start small businesses, schools, and training programs for other entrepreneurs," states Fortune. Other companies involved in the initiative with the Clinton Foundation include P&G and Unilever. Also part of the project: nonprofit Catalyst plans to start an annual list of women deemed prime to serve as directors of boards of U.S. corporations. Published on: Sep 20, 2016 Advertisement

L'Oreal USA's Matrix Oil Wonders folding carton   Spread the Word: News By Tag: * Folding Cartons * Packaging * Awards By Industry: * ManufacturingROCHESTER, N.Y. - Sept. 20, 2016 - PRLog -- Printing Impressions magazine announced that Diamond Packaging won three awards in the 29th annual Gold Ink Awards competition, the industry's most prestigious print competition. Winners were chosen from nearly 1,000 entries submitted within 50 different categories. Entries were judged on print quality, technical difficulty, and overall visual effect. Diamond won a Pewter Award in the "Calendars" category for its 2016 calendar, which marks the 25th anniversary of a long-standing company tradition. The grandfather clock theme, with its inner mechanisms perfectly balanced, represents the collaborative and precise nature of Diamond's work. The calendar was converted utilizing Clearwater Paper Candesce® SBS paperboard and offset printed with four color process inks, UV matte coating, and UV gloss spot coating. The dimensional header features a multi-level embossed and debossed woodgrain pattern, and a striking clock face insert enhanced with UV gloss spot coating, cold foil, and multi-level embossing, creating a dramatic sense of texture and depth. It also incorporates an opening APET rigid window panel and foil embossed chimes that artfully simulate a real grandfather clock. The middle backers also feature a multi-level embossed woodgrain pattern, and three unique sets of foil embossed gears enhanced with UV gloss spot coating. Metal Magic provided all of the embossing dies. The tightly-registered foil accents, which lend authenticity to the piece, were achieved using state-of-the-art, in-line cold foiling technology. They also showcase the type of decorative effects that can cost-effectively elevate customers' brands. Diamond won a Pewter Award in the "Folding Cartons" category for Elizabeth Arden's 5th Avenue Only NYC carton. The carton was converted utilizing metallized polyester board and printed with UV flexo fuchsia purple, dense black, and opaque white offset inks, in-line with DiamondTouch soft touch coating, UV matte, and UV gloss spot coating. High gloss embossed accents on the front panel provide a stunning contrast to the interlaced matte and spot UV gloss pattern surrounding it. The combination of color and textures reinforces 5th Avenue as a prestige brand, and beautifully complements the primary container – a glass bottle with tall clean lines, purple color palette, and gold infused cap. Diamond won a Pewter Award in the "Folding Cartons" category for L'Oreal USA's Matrix Oil Wonders promotional packaging. The carton was converted utilizing KapStone Kraftpak® high-yield, low density paperboard and printed with UV flexo white, opaque white, four color process, and dense black inks, in-line with UV varnish. Printed opaque white dots provide a perfect counterpoint to the brilliant gold foil stamped dots, creating dimension and visual interest. Gold foil surrounds the die cut windows, framing the hair care products within and drawing attention to the free product sample inside. The interplay between the unbleached paperboard and foil accents create shimmering metallic effects that are very unusual for a kraft-type folding carton. All of Diamond's winning entries were manufactured using 100% clean, renewable wind energy and produced in a Zero Manufacturing Waste to Landfill (ZMWL) facility.

The event in New York, for years considered a prime forum for movie stars, captains of industry and global leaders to put their good names to good works, is ending its run with a formidable list of accomplishments but burdened by the political complications of Hillary Clinton’s candidacy for president and the attendant scrutiny of the family’s ties to wealthy interests. Some well-known supporters of CGI, notably President Barack Obama, are missing from the guest list for this year’s meeting, when the door will close on an institution that’s won praise for reshaping philanthropy but also drawn derision for an atmosphere of pay-for-access. "If Breitbart and Fox are going on and on and on about how laced with controversy this organization is, that’s going to sound alarms to companies that are very risk averse," said Susan McPherson, a CGI member and CEO of McPherson Strategies, which advises corporate clients on philanthropic giving. "When you couple that with the presidential race, it makes it even riskier for them. They don’t want to be seen as pay-to-play if Hillary Clinton becomes president, and that has certainly had an effect this year." Some of the biggest corporate sponsors of years past are sitting out the finale: Exxon Mobil Corp. and Deutsche Bank AG already skipped last year, too. Other longtime sponsors Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Barclays PLC, and Blackstone Group LP are taking a pass as well. CGI will also be missing some of its main draws. Like Obama, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, will instead be at the United Nations General Assembly opening. Since Bill Clinton launched CGI as an arm of the Clinton Foundation in 2005, its members made more than 3,550 commitments and pledged to raise $125 billion to meet them, according to a Bloomberg News calculation based on annual reports. The group says its work has affected 430 million people in 180 countries. In philanthropy circles, CGI is widely credited with creating a new framework for giving and action, convening powerful figures from government, business and charities to address global problems. Members would pay for the privilege to meet and brainstorm solutions, then make financial commitments, often multi-year plans costing tens of millions of dollars. "When we started this in 2005 it was a great gamble," Clinton said Monday in opening remarks at the CGI meeting. "The way to end this is not on a nostalgia trip" but to "keep working to push the ball forward." Inaugural Meeting The annual event has been a showcase for Bill Clinton’s philanthropic aspirations in his post-presidency. At CGI’s inaugural meeting in September 2005, timed to coincide with the annual opening of UN session, Clinton showed his ambitions to keep his hand in world affairs beyond philanthropic commitments.  One panel featured a discussion about Mideast peace with King Abdullah II of Jordan, Condoleezza Rice, then secretary of state to President George W. Bush, and British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Rice praised CGI as a “wonderful initiative,” saying from the stage that “it mobilizes people to think what they can do about poverty and despair, and also hope and opportunity in the world.” The meeting resulted in 300 commitments worth more than $2.5 billion, the group said, and Clinton later said it had “succeeded beyond my expectations.” The following year’s lineup put on display the political and corporate star power Clinton could command, including Warren Buffett, Richard Branson, Bill Gates, Rupert Murdoch, first lady Laura Bush and French President Jacques Chirac. By 2009, CGI was ranked the No. 1 conference attracting CEOs from top companies, according to public relations firm Weber Shandwick “Five-Star Conference” study; in 2010, it took the No. 2 spot, behind the World Economic Forum in Davos. The bipartisan and non-political nature of the event persisted even after Hillary Clinton ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008 and then went on to serve as Obama’s first secretary of state. In September 2012, in the midst of the presidential race, then-Republican nominee Mitt Romney made an appearance. Clinton Impersonation Glamour was always a part of the CGI. In 2013, Bill Clinton was running late for a panel with the International Monetary Fund’s Christine LaGarde, Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg and Bono, when the U2 frontman grabbed the microphone and performed a spot-on impersonation of the former president, complete with accent and mannerisms. The CGI’s star power may have peaked in 2014, when 10 current or former heads of state were in attendance, including Obama. Although anticipation of her presidential run in 2016 was already building, Hillary Clinton emerged on the ballroom stage, bejeweled and swathed in royal blue, to announced, “Live from New York, it’s CGI!” Once her decision to run was set, the non-political air of CGI quickly faded. With rising populist anger at elites one of the defining features of the 2016 election season, Clinton’s relationship to wealthy donors, particularly those outside the U.S. who have contributed to the family foundation and attended the CGI meetings, became an unrelenting line of criticism of her both in the primary and general campaign.  Three days before the start of this year’s CGI, Donald Trump said he will press Hillary Clinton to release an audit of her family’s foundation work in Haiti, a country where both the foundation has done work and where CGI members have made millions of dollars worth of commitments. In a Slate podcast last month, one former CGI panel moderator, Adam Davidson, a contributor to the New Yorker and co-founder of NPR’s “Planet Money” program said that while he intends to support Hillary Clinton in November, CGI had given him a “creepy vibe” and that “it just feels like the worst version of an elite selling access to the aspirational” and creating a “theater” of doing good, while “it’s all about something else.” Zack Rosenburg, chief executive officer of SBP, a New Orleans-based disaster rebuilding and recovery firm that has looked to CGI for networking and sharing best pratices, called such criticism of CGI “a canard” and said, “there’s no doubt that the country and frankly the globe is better and healthier because of the commitments that have come out of the global initiative.” Most of the company’s taking a pass on this year’s gathering declined to comment beyond confirming they won’t participate.  Allen Jeffers, a spokesman for Exxon Mobil, said the company’s focus “has been on opportunities the CGI gave us to forge new partnerships with several nonprofit organizations working to combat malaria and provide economic opportunities for women in the developing world." Different Model From the outset, CGI had a different model for philanthropy. In fact, some of the commitments the group helped nail down weren’t philanthropy at all, like the one from private equity firm Leapfrog Investments. The firm launched a $135 million fund to invest in businesses serving lower income individuals in 10 developing nations to create 50,000 jobs. Two years later, it reported that revenue in its CGI portfolio increased 40.6 percent. Stephen Bowey, a partner at Leapfrog, said the group has created more than 102,000 jobs within four years. Venture capital firm Ignia made a commitment to CGI in 2011 to become the largest "impact investing fund" in Latin America. It raised and invested $200 million to meet that goal. That same year, Inerjys Ventures committed to setting up a $1 billion fund to invest in clean energy startups with the goal of turning them into profitable companies. The fund has since been scaled back to $300 million, according to a progress report. "We’re demonstrating the model we had initially talked about when we started engaging with CGI, bringing about real world examples of investing in tech companies and investing in projects to bring down the cost of clean energy," said Stephan Ouaknine, managing partner of Inerjys and a speaker at this year’s conference. Bob Harrison, president of CGI, said "if someone’s able to make money and also to do something positive from a social or environmental perspective it’s likely to be sustainable." Not all commitments have led to success. In 2005, Hollywood producer Stephen Bing, ex-World Bank President James Wolfensohn, venture capitalists Vinod Khosla and Ron Burkle made a $1 billion commitment to invest in renewable energy. The four made a few investments, but didn’t start a fund, according to Frank Quintero, a principal in Burkle’s Yucaipa Companies.  Others were difficult to assess. Greentech Automotive, the electric car company started by longtime Clinton confidante and Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, pledged in 2010 to sell Americans 100,000 electric cars at a price under $10,000. The company has yet to sell any cars in the U.S. In June, the Clinton Foundation released a study showing that 17 percent of its commitments were either unfulfilled or hadn’t provided progress reports for more than two years. There have been notable achievements. CGI helped broker a partnership between the AFL-CIO, the American Federation of Teachers and the National Building Trades Union to invest $14.5 billion in infrastructure investments since 2011, an effort they say has created at least 100,000 jobs. The group also put together the Energy and Resources Institute with more than 80 partner organizations to provide solar-powered electric lamps and charging stations to 900,000 people in Africa and Asia. Loyal Supporters Even though it’s lost some shine, plenty of longtime sponsors will still be at the final CGI meeting, including Procter & Gamble, which has made 14 CGI commitments since 2006, and furniture maker West Elm. West Elm President Jim Brett said that even though the criticism of CGI and the Clinton Foundation is unfounded, the negative coverage has cast enough of a shadow to give corporate public relations teams pause. “I’m very proud of our commitment, of our association with a foundation that does good in the world," Brett said. CGI’s end comes as the Clintons wind down philanthropic activities that could pose conflicts of interests if the former first lady, senator and secretary of state becomes president. Bill Clinton said he intends to continue a smaller, CGI university program that can be maintained with support from independent foundations and individuals. "In much of their work, they were aligned in their efforts with other funders, foundations, major nonprofits and NGOs," said Phil Buchanan, president of the Center for Effective Philanthropy, which evaluates charities. "I’m sure a lot of those funders are thinking, ’How can we step in?’" Bill Clinton had written in a 2007 book, “Giving,” that he wanted the annual meetings to continue for at least a decade to build a global network of citizen activists. In an August statement announcing this year’s would be the last, Clinton wrote, “That is exactly what CGI, its members and its dedicated staff have done.” In an interview with Charlie Rose for CBS and PBS released on Sept. 13, Bill Clinton said CGI had a bipartisan legacy and has been transparent. “I bent over backwards to try to make sure there was no conflict of interest, or appearance of conflict of interest,” the former president said. CGI “can’t run without the support of corporate sponsors and international contributors,” Clinton said. “That’s how we’ve gotten 3,500 commitments that have helped 430 million people in 180 countries. So, we can’t do that.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE Hillary Clinton Video Stories Philanthropy Family Terms of Service Trademarks Privacy Policy ©2016 Bloomberg L.P.

PHOTO BY: ENOS TECHE Facebook Twitter Google+ WhatsApp Email Exactly two years after the closure of Eveready’s Nakuru dry cell plant, the Kenyan market is suffering unstable supply of batteries, leading to shortage in most outlets across the country. This has been blamed on a six-month delay in the supply chain which has hurt the local market which now relies on imports. Most shops and retail stores in the country are currently short of the commodity, mostly used to power household equipment such as torches, remote controls, some radios and cameras among others. Common brands with shortages include Energizer products which Naivas chief commercial officer Willy Kimani yesterday said has had unstable supply for the last five months. Other common brands are Duracell and Eveready. Duracell has been in short of supply for the last four months, Kimani said. “The supply chain has been weak,” Kimani told the Star on phone affirming that the closure of Eveready East Africa's Nakuru plant in September 2014 “has a bit to play” in the shortage. A spot check by the Star over the last few weeks has established that major outlets such as Uchumi and Naivas have been experiencing a biting battery shortage. Uchumi’s Sarit Centre branch had no batteries at all, while the only battery brand available at some Naivas stores were a handful set of Varta and Energizer. All the household battery types D-size, dry cell AA and AAA have been affected. “The lack of D-size batteries has affected the ordering of some appliances such as torches that require this size of batteries. People aren’t quick to buy items that they can’t power. Eveready brought in supply about three months ago and it didn't last,” an attendant at Naivas, Westlands branch told the Star. Eveready closed down after grappling with unrelenting competition from cheap imports and counterfeits, that left the plant operating at about 25 per cent of its capacity. It resorted to importing batteries from its affiliate Energizer Egypt to sell locally. Eveready diversified into car batteries, shavers and light bulbs. The shortage of Duracell batteries has been attributed to the February 29, sell of the brand by Procter & Gamble to American multinational -Berkshire Hathaway. “Since P&G sold Duracell the products have not been in the market. We have however been assured that the products will be back in one or two weeks time,” Kimani said. Thank you for participating in discussions on The Star, Kenya.
