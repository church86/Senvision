Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Oct 18, 2016 at 3:36PM Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) investors are feeling optimistic for a change. Its stock is up 14% in 2016, which puts the consumer goods giant in the top third of all Dow stocks in year-to-date performance. That rally puts pressure on P&G to show real business progress when it posts quarterly results on Tuesday, Oct. 25. Here's what investors will want to see from the company next week. Sales growth P&G has encouraging momentum heading into the first quarterly report of its new fiscal year. Organic sales improved to a 2% expansion pace last quarter from 1% the prior quarter and 0% over the prior six months.  Image source: P&G investor presentation. In addition, the recent gains were powered by higher sales volume, and not just increased prices, which is good news because it implies healthier, more balanced growth. With volumes rising across its portfolio, P&G is poised to end its market share slide after two years of below-average growth. Yet that rebound might be held back by a weakening industry. Rival Unilever (NYSE:UL) just posted a rare volume decline as its expansion pace worsened to 3% from 5%. Executives said that demand for consumer products around the world "slowed further" from its already soft pace. That's why investors will be eager to hear from P&G CEO David Taylor about how the company is navigating that slump, along with an update on what it might mean for the company's forecast of 2% overall organic growth in fiscal 2017. Margin expansion P&G's business is supposed to produce consistently strong earnings growth of around 8% each year. Yet the company has fallen far short of that aim lately. In each of the last two fiscal years, in fact, core earnings fell 2%.  Image source: Getty Images. The company in early August projected a return to form in fiscal 2017, with core earnings rising by about 6%. A major contributor to that goal will be ramped up cost cuts. P&G squeezed $1.4 billion per year out of its expense structure lately by reducing overhead and improving efficiencies throughout its supply chain. Executives aren't resting on that success, though, and plan to boost savings to a $2 billion annual pace over the next five years. Cutting against those gains will be increased spending on things like marketing and innovation research. P&G is ramping up advertising support for its biggest brands while pouring cash into sampling programs that get trial versions of products like the Gillette razor blade into millions of consumers' hands every year. Management believes that savings from cost cuts will be enough to fund this extra commitment, while still producing earnings of about $3.85 per share this year -- up from $3.67 per share in fiscal 2016. Cash generation and returns Even as operating results disappoint, cash flow has been a key bright spot for P&G shareholders. The company produced over $15 billion of operating cash last year, and free cash amounted to well over 100% of earnings, beating the company's long-term target of at least 90% cash flow productivity.  Besides demonstrating the strength of its business model, rising cash flow is important because it directly impacts shareholder returns. P&G plans to deliver a huge portion of its market capitalization to its investors through stock buybacks and dividends over the next few years ($22 billion in fiscal 2017 alone), so its cash generation will be critical to watch. If gains in this area are strong, the company will be able to goose investor returns by dramatically lowering its share count while hiking its dividend. If not, income investors will likely be disappointed by another weak dividend raise this year following 2016's tiny 1% uptick. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos has no position in any stocks mentioned.

George Budwell (TMFGBudwell) Oct 17, 2016 at 7:07AM Image source: Getty Images. Buying stocks for your grandchildren can be a great way to ensure their financial future. However, it's not always easy picking stocks that are worthy of holding for exceedingly long periods of time. To help with this endeavor, our Foolish contributors offer up three stock picks below that appear to have the elements necessary to generate substantial returns over the long haul. Read on to find out which stocks they recommend, and why.  This "boring" brand should provide exciting long-term returns Jamal Carnette: I'm going to go against conventional wisdom by selecting Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). Most financial professionals recommend higher-risk, high-expected-return investments due to the long-term holding period, or advise buying a stock your grandchild knows and loves. Needless to say, Procter & Gamble likely doesn't fit either of these criteria. The most foreseeable risk for multigenerational investments is company-specific: the company going out of business due to lack of demand for its products. It's a safe assumption this will not occur with Procter & Gamble's Pampers, Bounty, Crest, Gillette, Head and Shoulders, and Tide brands. The current hot technology stock or clothing brand may not be relevant for long, but it's a safe bet that in 50 years consumers will still need to clean up spills, brush their teeth, shave, shower, and wash their clothes. Don't confuse boring products with boring returns: P&G stock has been on fire over the last year with a 26% one-year total return versus the S&P 500's increase of 10%. Over the last 15 years, P&G has averaged a return of 8% per year versus the S&P's gain of 7%. A large part of P&G's gains comes from the company's dividend, which currently yields 3%. Over the last 50 years, Procter & Gamble has grown that dividend at a rate of 9% per year. Putting Procter & Gamble stock in a dividend-reinvestment plan makes sense for long-term investors. Finally, there's a persistent belief among financial professionals that investments must excite young people in order to encourage them to invest. I think there's a possibility this approach might be teaching the youth wrong investing lessons. You should invest in a company because it has a favorable risk-return profile, not because you're currently enamored with a company's product. The consumer goods giant may not be exciting, but it's likely your grandchildren will use P&G products for the rest of their lives, so why not invest in the company? A smart, futuristic company for your grandchildren  Neha Chamaria: When you're considering stocks for a time frame as long as one that could benefit your grandchildren, you'd ideally look for a well-established global company with an unparalleled brand reputation, a wide moat, a track record of high returns, and promising growth prospects backed by products that can address the world's upcoming needs and challenges. Industrial stalwart General Electric (NYSE:GE) is one company that has it all. Image source: General Electric. Having freed itself of its volatile financial arm, GE Capital, the General Electric of today is stronger and leaner than ever. Through its seven core industrial business segments, GE gives you exposure to nearly every key industry, including healthcare, technology, aviation, oil and gas, transportation, manufacturing, automotive, and power. There are many diversified companies out there, but it's hard to find one that has gained a solid footprint in each of its business segments. While GE is now greatly exposed to cyclical industries, diversification should mitigate risks and keep the company sailing even during tough times. More important, GE is tapping aggressively into revolutionary future tech trends like the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, and 3D printing. With your grandkids likely to be living in a world dominated by these trends, GE is one of the best bets that you could make today. In fact, GE truly is a "digital industrial company," as it calls itself. I believe a visionary management, innovative leadership, and opportunistic strategies are among GE's top strengths that should propel it to new heights in the decades to come. As GE grows, so should the returns on your investment for your grandkids.  Pharma is always a good long-term buy-and-hold George Budwell: With the average age across the globe continuing to rise, healthcare companies in general, and pharma companies in particular, should remain some of the most profitable businesses in the world for a long time to come. In this regard, top biopharmaceutical companies like Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) come off as great stocks to buy for your grandkids. Gilead Sciences is a particularly intriguing name to buy right now for two reasons. First, this top biotech is trading at a steep discount relative to its earnings potential, with a rock-bottom forward price-to-earnings ratio of 6.3. Although it is true that Gilead's core hepatitis C franchise is facing a number of significant competitive and political threats, the company still has plenty of time and resources to stave off a big hit to its top line within the next few years. Unfortunately, the market has grown increasingly impatient with management's rather careful approach on the mergers and acquisitions front, but that doesn't mean Gilead's top line is destined to crash next year, or even in 2018.  Second, the biotech does have a fairly robust and diverse clinical pipeline that's apparently being completely ignored by the market from a valuation standpoint at the moment. Nevertheless, Gilead's plethora of exciting clinical candidates, such as the anti-inflammatory drug filgotinib and its variety of anticancer drug candidates, could generate billion in sales for the company in the not-so-distant future. All told, Gilead probably won't be a top-performing stock in the short term, but its strong track record of bringing game-changing new medications to market makes it worth buying as a long-term value play.

MARKETING Stop Spending Tens of Thousands on This Ineffective Marketing Tool Press releases are contrived and hideous. Stop writing them. By Nicole Volpe Miller Nicole is the Chief Operating Officer of Deke Digital, working with financial services and healthcare executives to create and distribute expert commentary on major media platforms. @nicolevolpe Chief Operating Officer, Deke Digital@nicolevolpe WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement If you are writing press releases, and you are not a company the size of Apple or Procter & Gamble, you need to stop. Now. To journalists, press releases are annoying. The format is lawyerly. The quotes are made up. They are full of jargon, and totally self-serving. They are written to bury any negatives. No one ever fails or is fired or acquired. In press releases, companies always have successful quarters, and executives always step down to spend time with their families, and companies merge as equals. By sending press releases with such logic bombs in them, you are not giving journalists information. You are giving them work to do; a riddle to be worked out. Their editor is standing over them asking: Okay, what really happened? And if you do not have, say, over $250 million in annual revenue, there simply are not enough journalists left in newsrooms to bother to try to detangle that riddle. Newsrooms are at half the staff they were in the mid-90s. Even if a reporter is initially fooled by your sunny release on, say, your poor quarterly performance, where you bury the actual net loss number and put forward some other metric that sounds like you made money, you have essentially forced a correction on that reporter. Nothing hurts a journalist more than that. Just Tell Your Story There are so many other ways to get your story across, and told in a format that's more straightforward or conversational. The Securities and Exchange Commission in 2013 ruled that social media can be used to disseminate material information about your company. Or you could use your own website. Or check out self-publishing platform Medium as a place where you can tell your story, for free, without being constrained by the press release format. Why not just tell your story in some format that fits your style? There are lots of examples of people who get this right: Warren Buffett has been writing his letter to shareholders each year since the 1970s. Marc Andreessen gets his ideas out in tweetstorms. Techstars founder Brad Feld has his FeldThoughts blog. Mary Meeker can pack an entire universe of data and ideas into her yearly Internet reports. The press release industry is in as tight a spot as the news business. They are only surviving because the press release is a habit that executives and marketers have not yet reconsidered closely enough to break. If you have something to announce, the reflex is to "issue a release." This despite that it's potentially costing you tens of thousands per year to distribute these press releases, on top of what you are paying people skilled in writing in the format. This made sense pre-Internet, when your release would automatically print out on dot-matrix printers stationed in the heart of each newsroom. But now, not so much. Put It To The Test Here is the test: Who picks up your releases and actually writes an article? If you are getting picked up by journalists writing a full article, and calling you for additional information and quotes, then by all means, proceed. But that is extremely rare for companies that are not the very biggest in their sector. Beware of people who justify your press release spend by pointing out that the press release itself is being carried on various sites--Marketwatch, AOL Finance, etc. So what? The traffic to press release pages on those sites is extremely low. In fact, it used to be that press releases were important enough in the news economy that sites like Yahoo Finance would pay for them. Then executives at those portals looked at their traffic numbers and saw that next to no one was clicking on them. When the Yahoo Finances of the world told the PR distribution companies of the world they wouldn't pay them anymore, the press release distribution companies offered them for free to the portals. At that point, financial news portals started to realize that they still didn't want to carry content that was uninteresting to its readers. And then the press release distribution companies instead offered to pay to have them run. Why would they pay to have them run? Because the head of marketing at the firm that posted the press release would be able to see that the press release was live on the financial news portals, and show that to their CEO as proof they had done their job. The problem is that the CEO and the head of marketing were perhaps the only people to ever click on that link. The question is: Do you want to pay for that?

Jim Cramer rang the lightning round bell, which means he gave his take on caller favorite stocks at rapid speed: Procter & Gamble: "I like Procter. I'd like you to buy it a little bit cheaper, because I think it can come down to $84 or $85. But I think it's a good choice." Synchrony Financial: "That thing has come down too much. That's kind of attractive to me ... You know what's more attractive? If Visa sells off a couple of bucks. My charitable trust owns it. I think that Charlie Scharf [outgoing CEO] has got some personal things he has to attend to at home in New York, and that stock is coming down and that may be a better opportunity." Petrobras: "It has made a big comeback because the real has gotten very strong. Petrobras, I don't know. This is a play on the real, and the real is good but I think I don't want to overstay my welcome. I would be tempted to cash in on half." Bristol-Myers Squibb: "Candidly, I was disappointed with the study that just came out. I thought that Opdivo had more opportunities to do it ... I do not expect anything good near-term for Bristol-Myers. That was just a disappointing study." CIT Group: "Why don't you focus on Citi? My charitable trust owns Citi, that was the best quarter so far. I would be in Citi. JPMorgan was a great quarter, don't get me wrong. But they have done nothing but great quarters." Radius Health: "Bob Ward [CEO], he has done a fantastic job, and I like Radius. Everyone keeps saying it's going to get a bid. I think it's going to have good test results, and therefore it is OK to own. But this whole bid thing is just getting out of control. I see this stock trading up a couple of bucks every morning, and I say come on." Chesapeake Energy: "Chesapeake's got good natural gas exposure, but my problem is that I don't like the balance sheet. And because of that, there are so many others that are better. I think that you should just stock with Schlumberger. I think Schlumberger is the way to play the oil business." Questions for Cramer?

With the massive growth in the B2C e-commerce market across the globe, manufacturers are extending their online presence in several beautysegments. Also, customers opt for this distribution channel as it is convenient, time-saving, and offers product reviews and feedbacks. Some of the key pure-play e-retailers that offer face oils include Amazon,Alibaba, JD.com, and Rakuten Brijesh Kumar Choubey, an industry expert at Technavio for research on cosmetics and toiletry, says, "Vendors in the market are shifting towards the use of social media tools, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube, to increase awareness and promote their products. The increasing consumer engagement in social networking and blogs have prompted players to come out with some successful social media campaigns for several facial care products. For instance, P&G's 'Your Best Beautiful' for Olay, L'Oréal's 'Rock Your Style' for Garnier and Shiseido's 'Beauty vs. the World' for SHISEIDO are some of the most effective marketing campaigns Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=53762 Technavio's sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. Based on product category, the report categorizes the global face oils market into the following segments: Anti-aging beauty oils Facial cleansing oils Face moisturizing oils Pre-shave oils Global face oils market by product category 2015 (%) Anti-aging beauty oils 38.01% Facial cleansing oils 25.13% Face moisturizing oils 22.34% Pre-shave oils 14.52% Source: Technavio Global anti-aging beauty oils market The anti-aging beauty oils segment is the fastest-growing category among the face oil products and is predominantly driven by the increasing demand among the aging population across the globe. The population group of around 60 years and above is one of the key customer segments for anti-aging oils. Anti-aging beauty oil products provide benefits like enriching the renewal of the skin's outer layer. Some of the popular anti-aging beauty oils brands include P&G's SK-II Facial Treatment Cleansing Oil, Estée Lauder's Resilience Lift Restorative Radiance Oil, and LVMH's Guerlain Abeille Royale Face Treatment Oil. Vendors in this product segment are coming up with several strategic initiatives to launch new product lines of face oils with anti-aging benefits to cater to the growing requirements from consumers. One of the latest developments in this segment is the advent of anti-aging beauty oil products made with natural and organic ingredients such as argan oil, marula oil, and safflower oil enriched with vitamin E. Some such natural anti-aging beauty oils are ProGenius Omega Treatment Rescue Oil from NUDE Skincare and The Body Shop Oils of Life Intensely Revitalising Facial Oil from L'Oréal. Global facial cleansing oils market The introduction of new products and the growing application of facial cleansing oils in salons and spas are anticipated to drive considerable adoption of cleansing oils over the next four years. Recently, ULTA Beauty has launched hydrating cleansing oil, which specializes in removing impurities on the skin. Manufacturers in the market are also launching several facial cleansing oils with additional properties such as sunscreens with SPF. For instance, Shiseido's Ultimate Cleansing Oil, is made using a purifying formula that eliminates long-wearing foundation, is water-resistant, and has high-SPF sunscreens. With the growing inclination towards facial cleansing oils with natural ingredients, the segment will register a CAGR of more than 3% by 2020. The French manufacturer, L'Occitane's Shea Cleansing Oil is manufactured using shea butter and sunflower seed oil and has gained massive popularity among consumers. Global face moisturizing oils market Some of the popular face moisturizing oils available in the market are Estée Lauder Nutritious Radiant Vitality Essence Oil and CLINIQUE Take the Day Off Cleansing Oil from Estée Lauder. Manufacturers in the market are coming up with face moisturizing oils that are effective for multi-skin problems like dark spots, dryness, dullness, and uneven skin tone and texture. CLINIQUE Turnaround Revitalizing Treatment Oil from Estée Lauder and L'Occitane Immortelle Divine Youth Oil from L'Occitane are some of the most popular multi-purpose face moisturizing oils. "Though the face oil moisturizers provide moisture and refreshment to reduce the extra dryness of the face, the relative high price of these products have slowed their adoption rate in the market. However, with the growing demand for natural face moisturizing oils, this segment will also witness significant growth over the predicted period. Some of the natural face moisturizing oils are Vitamin E Facial Oil and Tea Tree Oil by The Body Shop from L'Oréal. This Vitamin E Facial Oil offers an aromatic, pre-moisturizer treatment for the skin to enhance moisturization," says Brijesh. Global pre-shave oils market The global pre-shave oils market is expected to grow at a steady pace during the forecast period due to the growing demand among men for shaving oils in the developed markets such as the UK, the US, Australia, and Canada. Vendors in the market are promoting their products to drive sales coupled with new product launches. For instance, in October 2015, Dreadnought, a UK based manufacturer specialized into men's grooming, introduced new portfolio of barbershop quality beard oils such as Dreadnought Classic Blend Beard Oil and Dreadnought Cuban Blend Beard Oil. This segment is the second-fastest growing category among face oil products. Some of the popular pre-shave oils are L'Occitane's Cade Shaving Oil and L'Oreal's Viktor Rolf Spicebomb Nourishing Pre-shave Oil. Some of the premium beauty manufacturers are launching natural pre-shave oils through their flagship brands such as LVMH under its flagship brand The Art of Shaving include Pre-Shave Oil Sandalwood and Pre-Shave Oil - Lavender.

Bill Rinehart / WVXU Listen Listening... / 3:51 People who live in Madisonville like to say their neighborhood is one of the most welcoming in Greater Cincinnati and also one of the most racially balanced. The community has had population shifts in the past, and appears to be undergoing another change. When Addie Hunter moved to Madisonville almost 47 years ago her family was the first black one on the block. Neighbors welcomed them. That was 1969, when integration wasn't common in America. "We had a lot of good people. Most of them worked for Procter and Gamble on our street. And they taught my boys how to cut grass and gave us stuff and told them how to keep the house up. And they taught them. And it was good. So we had good friends then." Recently, she's noticed more whites moving in and blacks moving out. "It bothers me a little bit because I wish they would hold on and try to do better. But the younger people don't want to stay it seems like. The parents leave the homes and they're gone." Hunter says three of her own children moved to Atlanta about a decade ago.  Bill Collins has lived in Madisonville for 23 years. He also sees black middle class people moving out and as a white man it worries him. "I don't really like living in all white communities. I find them kind of dull." But beyond that, Collins says the neighborhood is losing leaders. "It's the fact that so many of the young, working class and middle class African-Americans who grew up there in the 80s and 90s and 2000s who would be really good leaders in the community, potentially, that they're leaving. That’s what concerns me the most." Collins says he's looked at the census data and found out why people leave the neighborhoods. It's jobs. Or a lack of them. Community leaders say there are developments underway that will create jobs., that will take care of maintaining income diversity for Madisonville.  But keeping up racial diversity will take some more thought. Luke Brockmeyer says as the president of the community council, he can't just make plans that will appeal to 30-something white guys like himself. He says if an event or a neighborhood is to succeed he has to think about the wants and needs of his neighbors, who may or may not look like him. "And life is way better when you do that. I mean you're happier. You spend more time thinking. You have more friends. You're better informed. I think there are a lot of people who have never lived in a neighborhood like this who would hear that and say 'that sounds like a lot of work.' But it isn't. It's part of being human and it makes you more human." That's not to say Madisonville is a racial utopia. Community Council Vice President Prentis Wilson says when she came to the community in 1965, there was integration, but not much mingling. She says there are still barriers today. "There are some people two or three doors up from me, they don't have a clue as to how black people feel. And a lot of black people don't have a clue as to how white people feel." Wilson says Madisonville is more diverse than ever before. She says her street right now is pretty much 50-50, white and black. You can't make a community diverse. You can nudge it in that direction but in the end it comes down to individuals. That's what 32-year-old Brant Walker seems to think. "Some people know how to live around each other and other people don't. It all depends on who you are and what you believe in." That's how a lot of people in Madisonville apparently see it too.  It may not always be easy to discuss race, but as Bill Collins and Luke Brockmeyer put it, you have to be willing to talk and to listen.

Top issue in Crescent Springs: Economic development Melissa Reinert, mstewart@communitypress.com 8:31 p.m. EDT October 17, 2016 A view of Joella’s Hot Chicken restaurant in Crescent Springs. Joella’s opened right across the street from Nashville Hot chicken restaurant in April. Economic development is the top issue in the Crescent Springs City Council election. (Photo: File photo) CRESCENT SPRINGS - Seven candidates are seeking a spot on the six-seat Crescent Springs City Council. This election all incumbents, except for Councilman Louis Prabell, one newcomer and a former councilman are running. Christie Arlinghaus Councilwoman Christie Arlinghaus is seeking her sixth term on council. She is a retired executive from the Internal Revenue Service and currently serves as chairwoman of the city’s Communications Committee. “I want to continue to expand our business community,” she said. “I feel the city should be reaching out to developers to bring new business into the city. I want to continue to keep property taxes low along with the insurance premium tax.” Mike Daugherty Councilman Mike Daugherty, 54, is finishing his second year on council this term, but has served a total of eight years as a member of council. He works for Zwicker & Associates and is running again because he believes in civic involvement. He said the top two issues facing the city are economic development and city stability. “We need to continue to work with businesses that are currently in the community and those that might wish to join our community to make Crescent Springs a place that businesses want to locate,” he said. “We need to continue to be good stewards of our taxpayers’ money. We are relatively debt free, and we need to continue to watch all line items to remain in a good position.” Carter Dickerson Newcomer Carter Dickerson, 34, has served on the city’s Board of Adjustments since January 2015. He is a professional landscape architect at Viox & Viox Inc. He is running for council to “bring the perspective of the younger family demographic.” According to Dickerson, the city has a strong foundation on which it can improve. “I hope to work with the mayor and City Council on how best to improve our city and the ways that it can most be enjoyed by our citizens,” he said. “I also want to be a conduit through which all citizens feel that they can be represented and have their voices heard by city leadership.” Bob Mueller Councilman Bob Mueller is finishing his second term on City Council since he was last elected. He also served on council in 2005 and 2006. Mueller, 60, is a purchasing manager with Procter and Gamble. He’s seeking re-election because this is something he loves. “If this is something you love, then you have to do it,” he said. “I want to maintain the financial stability of the city, I enjoy this work. The decisions I participate in affect my neighbors and me. This is a great way to impact your community.” According to Mueller, the business community in the city should be a top priority. “We’re seeing economic development or the business community in a state of turnover,” he said. “The economy has challenged businesses to be more frugal in how they operate. We need to work on attracting and maintaining businesses. We have to market ourselves more aggressively and look at our tax structure and incentive programs.” Dale Ramsey Dale Ramsey, 58, previously served on City Council from 2000 to 2014. He works for G4S Security. “I’m seeking re-election to help serve the city I live in, and it’s citizens,” he said. “Our current City Council is doing a very good job taking care of issues concerning the city. I want to be a part of that.” Thomas Vergamini Councilman Thomas Vergamini, 65, has served on council since 1999. He is an attorney and seeking re-election to “continue to serve the city and its residents in order to provide the most efficient, workable solutions to issues facing a small suburban city.” According to Vegamini, the top two issues facing Crescent Springs are economic development and the heroin epidemic. “(We need to) establish an economic development plan and market the city as a place to do conduct a thriving, successful business and for individuals to locate as a place to call home,” he said. To fight the heroin epidemic, he said the city needs to “seek collaborative solutions with health care, social service providers and surrounding communities.” Matthew Zeck Councilman Matthew Zeck, 46, has served on council since 2006. He is a commercial sales manager of cash management services for Fifth Third Bank. “The good news for the city of Crescent Springs is that there are not any urgent or troubling issues,” he said. “The city officially became debt free in September of 2016, an incredible accomplishment by the staff and finance committee of the city on behalf of the residents and taxpayers. “While some cities are facing major street repair issues or loss of business revenues or deteriorating property values, Crescent Springs is poised to further strengthen its infrastructure and make improvements to drive more efficiency.” Two issues that will be on the forefront to address, he said, are the continued review of possible consolidation of services and ongoing efficiency opportunities to improve service delivery to the residents of Crescent Springs. Examples are installation LED street lights to improve energy usage and capture expense savings, he said. “As we have for the past many years, I will participate in the continual evaluation of the services needed by the residents and analyzing the pros and cons and expense versus benefit of consolidation of services, such as police and equipment, etc.” Regarding ongoing efficiency opportunities, Zeck said, he will “continue to be active in the projects that seek to drive efficiency and cost savings opportunities, without reducing the quality of offerings our residents receive.” Want to continue the conversation?

Recently Jack along with his principal John Slattery and Ms. Frawley entered a competition for brave children who have overcome personal difficulties and still manage to compete in sports. The competition was called ‘Thank you mum’, a campaign to recognise the influence and support Irish mums give to all their children. This competition was sponsored by Proctor and Gamble. During the visit Katie spoke of Jack’s unbelievable courage and said she was honoured to meet both Jack and his twin sister Amy, both 2nd class pupils in Corville. Katie acknowledged the tremendous work done by Jack’s parents Enda and Linda and also the school community. Katie also remarked on the wonderful sports facilities that Corville has to offer the present and future children of Roscrea. Mr. Slattery thanked Katie for an unforgettable day that will live long in the memories of every child and adult present. “Katie is an inspiration to our community and she is a credit to her own mum”. Katie was very generous with her time and addressed all the pupils at length in the school before leading a 45 minute PE session with Jack’s class. Katie left the school, leaving behind big dreams for the boys and girls to achieve and several sets signed boxing gloves that will be raffled by the school during the year. Mr. Slattery remarked that Katie is one of the most down to earth people he has ever met and that she would be a natural teacher. Katie and her team have promised a return visit to Corville in the future.

Coty, which owns hair colour brands such as Wella and Clairol, became the global No 2 in hair colour and styling products through its $12.5bn acquisition of Procter & Gamble’s perfume, hair care and makeup businesses in October. London-based ghd generated £178m in revenue in fiscal year 2016. The business will become part of Coty’s professional beauty unit, which services salon owners and professionals in hair and nail care, and will be a standalone business led by its current chief executive Anthony Davey and team, Coty said on Monday. The all-cash deal, to conclude by the end of 2016, is expected to immediately add to Coty’s earnings, the company said. Coty said last year it would shift its executive team to London, as part of its transformation into a global beauty products maker. Lion Capital and ghd are being advised by Rothschild & Co and Proskauer Rose LLP. Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom LLP is the legal adviser to Coty.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Beauty products maker Coty Inc (COTY.N) said it would buy ghd, a high-end hairstyling appliances brand, from private equity firm Lion Capital LLP for about 420 million pounds ($522 million). Coty, which owns hair color brands such as Wella and Clairol, became the global No. 2 in hair color and styling products through its $12.5 billion acquisition of Procter & Gamble's (PG.N) perfume, hair care and make-up businesses in October. London-based ghd, whose name stands for "good hair day," generated 178 million pounds in revenue in fiscal year 2016. The business will become part of Coty's Professional Beauty unit, which services salon owners and professionals in hair and nail care, and will be a standalone business led by its current Chief Executive Anthony Davey and team, Coty said on Monday. The all-cash deal, scheduled to close by the end of 2016, is expected to immediately add to Coty's earnings, the company said. Sky News first reported the deal. Coty said last year it would shift its executive team to London, as part of its transformation into a global beauty products maker. Lion Capital and ghd are being advised by Rothschild & Co and Proskauer Rose LLP. Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom LLP is the legal adviser to Coty.

Last week, six large companies announced they would work together to educate consumers about paper and wood products certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). The businesses include International Paper, Kimberly-Clark, HP, McDonald’s, Procter & Gamble and Williams Sonoma. These firms join nonprofit partners WWF, Sierra Club and National Wildlife Federation in the effort to showcase FSC’s brand and reputation. Other companies joining this campaign include outdoor gear companies Burton and Patagonia; the furniture maker West Elm; and home furnishings giant Pottery Barn. All of these companies either produce paper products, manufacture goods from timber or, in the case of HP, use paper extensively within their supply chain. FSC, and its large corporate partners, cite the oft-noted statistics that the world’s forests are host to about 80 percent of the world’s biodiversity and provide an economic lifeline for at least 1.6 billion people. The timing is definitely spot on, as this accelerated push to amplify FSC’s messages and its benefits comes at a time when deforestation is often in the headlines. Relentless fires across Indonesia could have caused as many as 100,000 deaths last year, and the ongoing bad news about palm oil offers other industries an opportunity to shine and spotlight their work on managing forests. Yet there are also positive signs, as more companies have partnered with NGOs in order to halt the destruction of what is one of the world’s most important carbon sinks. Initiatives such as the Bonn Challenge show promise to restore more of the world’s forests. Environmental NGOs have long touted the FSC’s certification systems as they are designed to stop the harvest of rare old-growth forests, slash the use of hazardous chemicals, protect water quality, and engage local communities with a particular focus on protecting the human rights of indigenous peoples. The problem with this over-produced ‘One Simple Action’ agenda, however, is that it is heavy on public relations campaigning, blares loudly like an advertisement to purchase from certain brands and, quite frankly, is low on substance. And therein lies a huge opening for more criticism, as the FSC has garnered its fair share of detractors. Greenpeace, for example, acknowledged that the FSC has been critical to improving the performance of companies within the paper and timber industries. But the problem, according to a 2013 report, is that FSC-certified operators have been involved with dubious forestry practices and are ensnared in conflict with local communities from Brazil and Indonesia to the Congo Basin. Another company that has been committed to FSC certification, the furniture giant Ikea, was accused by the Guardian of logging old-growth forests in northwestern Russia. It is true that no certification system is going to be perfect. The palm oil industry is struggling to stop deforestation with its sustainable standards organization, the RSPO. The global beef sector is making moves to mitigate its impact on people and the planet. Ongoing revelations of human rights violations show the garment industry has a long road ahead to score consumer trust, and this sector clearly could benefit a centralized sustainability standards system analogous to FSC. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests FSC has much work to do to ensure that all of its operators and participating brands are truly compliant and committed to stopping deforestation, rather than patting themselves on the back. These leading brands’ commitments do indeed give the organization a shot in the arm. But what FSC and its partners need to do now is leverage the power of these organizations to ensure their systems are truly rigorous if they are going to score the buy-in of the skeptics out in the marketplace.

Can you pay for retirement with dividends instead of interest? Nathan Bachrach, Ed Finke and Amy Wagner 12:04 a.m. EDT October 17, 2016 . (Photo: .) Twice every week, Simply Money’s Nathan Bachrach, Ed Finke and Amy Wagner are answering your financial questions. If you, a friend, or someone in your family has a money issue or problem, please feel free to send those questions toyourmoney@enquirer.com Margaret from Western Hills: This is a question about stock dividends. With bond and certificate of deposit interest so low, and a good number of stocks paying dividends above 3 percent, is it possible to pay for retirement with dividends instead of interest? Answer: As a purely mathematical issue, yes, it is possible to cover some or all of your retirement expenses with dividends (assuming, of course, you actually own enough of the underlying dividend-paying stocks). This is quite common with investors who’ve either inherited a large position in one or two stock holdings, or accumulated a significant holding via employment, e.g. Procter & Gamble. The real question is whether you should utilize this strategy even if it’s mathematically possible. A well-diversified portfolio which includes interest-bearing investments does much more than just provide income. Owning bonds, as well as stocks, spreads your risk and limits instability during hectic market cycles (think of them as “shock absorbers”). Generating income is – like most elements of investing – a trade-off between risks and rewards. Make sure you understand both before overweighting your portfolio in any one particular direction.

Carolan, 47, will lead the division that includes Bolthouse Farms beverages, salad dressings and carrots, Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa, hummus and dips, and fresh soup, which combined account for approximately $1 billion in net sales.   Carolan will succeed Jeff Dunn, who is leaving Campbell to become Chief Executive Officer of Juicero, Inc., the San Francisco-based startup that recently launched the first professional-quality, connected countertop cold-press juicer. Campbell has invested $13.5 million in Juicero, which is focused on inventing products, services and experiences that help people consume more fresh fruits and vegetables.   Dunn also will remain involved in Acre Venture Partners, the independent venture capital operation to which Campbell committed $125 million in 2016, as a venture partner. Additionally, Campbell will retain its seat on Acre’s investment committee, as well as its board observer seat at Juicero. Both positions will be held by Adam Ciongoli, Campbell’s General Counsel.   Commenting on Dunn’s departure, Campbell’s President and Chief Executive Officer Denise Morrison said, “Jeff has made important contributions to Campbell during his time with the company. We wish him well as he embarks on a new and exciting chapter of his career, and I look forward to continuing to collaborate with him through Acre Venture Partners and in his new role at Juicero.”   Carolan and Dunn will work together to manage the transition over the next several weeks.   Commenting on Carolan’s appointment, Morrison said, “Ed is an excellent leader who has played a critical role as we pursue Campbell’s strategic imperatives and transform the way we work. He brings both strategic insights and deep experience as a hands-on operator with a long track record of delivering outstanding business results. In his new role, he will be supported by a strong and seasoned leadership team at C-Fresh. I am confident that Ed and the team will continue to expand our presence in the faster-growing packaged fresh category.”   Carolan joined Campbell in 2001 and has successfully led several significant businesses and functions. Most recently, he served as President of Integrated Global Services (IGS). Formed in January 2015, IGS is Campbell’s global shared services organization focused on building enterprise capabilities while lowering costs. In that role, Carolan created and implemented a business model designed to unlock value for the company, build new capabilities and deliver faster and more efficient services. Under Carolan’s leadership, IGS drove cost savings that contributed to the company’s gross margin expansion and record cash flow from operations in fiscal 2016.   Earlier in his career, as President, US Retail, Carolan was responsible for Campbell’s $3.6 billion US Soup, Sauces and Beverages business. He also led the US Soup and Simple Meals business for Campbell, where he drove five consecutive quarters of growth in US soup, including 5 percent growth in fiscal 2013. Previously, he served as General Manager – Pepperidge Farm Snacks Division, leading the crackers and cookies business, where he accelerated growth behind Goldfish crackers. From 2006 to 2009, he was General Manager of Campbell’s StockPot® fresh soup and North America Foodservice businesses.   Before joining Campbell, Carolan spent five years in brand management at Procter & Gamble. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology and a Master of Business Administration from Harvard Business School.   Kessler To Lead IGS   Bethmara Kessler, previously Vice President, Corporate Audit, was named Senior Vice President of IGS, succeeding Carolan. Kessler will join Campbell’s Leadership Team and will become a corporate officer.   Kessler joined Campbell as Vice President, Corporate Audit in 2014 from Warner Music Group, where she had served as Senior Vice President, Internal Audit, and Co-Chief Compliance Officer. Before that, she co-founded and worked for the Fraud and Risk Advisory Group, a consulting firm. Earlier in her career, she served on the executive leadership team at Limited Brands. She also played a key role in helping implement the company's shared services processes and capabilities.   Kessler earned a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in accounting from Baruch College of the City University of New York. She is a certified fraud examiner and a certified information systems auditor. She is a member of the Association of Fraud Examiners, Institute of Internal Auditors and Information Systems Audit & Control Association.   Morrison said, “IGS is a critical part of our efforts to build capabilities and reduce costs to unlock the growth potential of our business. Bethmara is a strong leader with experience in running a shared services organization and implementing enterprise processes that deliver results. Her wealth of experience in strengthening capabilities, fostering talent and leading teams will be an asset to Campbell as she leads IGS to help accelerate our performance.” Did you enjoy this article?

He was 96. Brand was host of WNYC’s Folksong Festival for 70 years, and was also host of New York Public Radio’s (NPR) Voices in the Wind. His show featured interviews with and songs by many of the folk music greats, including Bob Dylan; Joan Baez; Woody Guthrie; Arlo Guthrie; Joni Mitchell; Peter, Paul & Mary; Judy Collins and Pete Seeger. Brand was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, on Feb. 7, 1920. After graduating from Brooklyn College with a BS in psychology, he joined the U.S. Army and served in World War II. He was cited for his work as section chief of a psychology unit and, later, as editor of a newspaper for psychiatric patients. After the war, in 1945, he began presenting what is now the oldest continuous radio show in history, the award-winning Folksong Festival on NPR. His name can be found among the credits of 75 documentary films, such as Gulf’s Invisible Journey, Ford’s Highway by the Sea, Bell’s Ballad to the Fair and many others for which he has garnered Venice, Edinburgh, Golden Reel, Valley Forge, Freedoms Foundation, Scholastic and Golden Lion Awards. He collected Peabody, Ohio State, Edison and Emmy Awards for his hundreds of television shows and was host of Procter and Gamble’s top-rated Canadian series, Let’s Sing Out for four years. He was music director of NBC-TV’s Sunday Show, Exploring, Treasure Chest and others, and was host and composer for The First Look and NBC’s syndicated Spirit of ’76. As a leading performer for children on TV, records and films, he was on the advisory panel which created Sesame Street. He has scripted and scored ballets for Agnes DeMille and John Butler, commercials for Rival, Log Cabin, Maxwell House, Oldsmobile and more, and was responsible for songs in the films The Fox, Sybil, The Long Riders and Blue Chips. He created music for the critically acclaimed In White America as well as the score for How to Steal an Election. With Paul Nassau, he wrote the lyrics and music for the Broadway shows, A Joyful Noise with John Raitt and directed by Dore Shary, and The Education of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N with Hal Linden and Tom Bosley, and directed by George Abbott. He also wrote and scored the Kennedy Center’s Bicentennial musical, Sing America Sing and composed the Canadian anthem, “Something to Sing About.” Brand was the curator of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, author of seven best-selling books, recorded 90 LPs and wrote songs for Doris Day, Ella Fitzgerald, Harry Belafonte, the Smothers Brothers and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.

It started when a TGV stopped after hitting the suicide victim in northern Burgandy. Rail traffic was blocked with around 20 TGV trains between Marseille and Paris delayed for an average of 4.5 hours. Movement - French police officers have been gathering throughout France as part of a movement in support of a fellow colleague who was seriously injured on the 8th October in an attack on his patrol vehicle in Essonne. Police officers gathered during the night in silence in Paris and other regions of France including Nantes, Narbonne and Nice. Arrest - A 32 year old man has been placed in police custody after being arrested at Nice airport. According to reports the man was arrested on Sunday after injuring two police officers and making terrorist threats. The man reportedly has no previous criminal record and is due to appear in  court today. Shooting - Police have opened an investigation following another shooting in Nice.

National Calais - Fourteen unaccompanied teenagers who have been living in the Calais "Jungle" were set to be reunited with relatives after being transferred to Britain on Monday, ahead of the demolition of the French migrant camp. The arrival of the children, who the Home Office interior ministry said were aged between 14 and 17 and from countries including Syria and Sudan, are due to be followed by dozens more in the coming days. They are entitled to move to Britain under EU asylum law due to their family ties to those already in the UK. But campaigners and faith leaders warned there were many more left behind who also deserved the country's help. Brexit - Paris's business district, La Defense, has launched a playful advertising campaign to lure away companies based in Britain seeking a new European base of operations following Brexit. Hoardings of a frog sporting a tie with the colours of the French flag and asking "Tired of the fogs? Try the frogs!" are to go up in the City, London's business district, as well train stations and airports in the British capital. Business Reports from the UK suggest that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Phillip Hammond is increasingly isolated in the cabinet as the government of Prime Minister Theresa May moves towards Brexit. There have been suggestions that Mr Hammond may resign although this has been denied in government circles while other reports say that ministers want the Chancellor to make a public statement giving his unequivocal support for the Prime Minister’s position on exiting the European Union. The Treasury is said to have been “sidelined” as the government prepares to trigger article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty by the end of March next year. Mr Hammond is said to favour a “soft Brexit” with Britain retaining its membership of the single market but he’s in the minority in the cabinet. The US cosmetics and beauty firm Coty is buying the British hair straightener GHD for 420 million pounds. GHD was founded by three entrepreneurs in Bradford in 2001 for 15,000 pounds. Since then,its ceramic straightening irons and hairdryers have become popular with stylists and celebrities. Coty already owns a number of leading hair care brands including Wella and Clairol. A few months ago,Coty became the world’s third largest beauty firm following a 12.5 billion dollar takeover of Procter and Gamble’s perfume,haircare and makeup business. And-Shares in Netflix have jumped by 20 percent after the video streaming firm announced better than expected subscriber numbers. Netflix says that it added another 3.2 million subscribers globally in the third quarter-far more than the 2 million expected by analysts’. In the US numbers increased by 21 percent  helping quarterly revenues rise by 31 percent to 2.29 billion dollars. In the three months to the end of September,Netflix had around 83.3 million subscribers. Sport Football-Liverpool and Manchester United played out a disappointing 0-0 draw at Anfield last night as the visitors played a defensive game that prevented Liverpool from building momentum and the chance to draw level with Manchester City at the top of the table. The Champions League is back in action tonight. Bayer Leverkusen play Spurs in Group E while CSKA host Monaco. In Group F Real Madrid host Legia Warsaw and Sporting play Borussia Dortmund. Group G pairs Brugge with Porto and Leicester against FC Copenhagen while in Group H Dinamo Zagreb play Sevilla and Lyon host Juventus. There’s a full programme in the English Championship tonight.Tune in tomorrow morning for the results. Cricket-Pakistan have beaten West Indies in the day-night Test in Dubai by 56 runs. A second innings century by Darren Bravo had given West Indies some hope of pulling off a remarkable win but it wasn’t quite enough in the end as his side were bowled out for 289-57 short of their target. Tennis-Nick Kyrgios has been banned for 8 tournament weeks and fined 25,000 dollars for his behaviour at last week’s Shanghai Masters. The Australian patted the ball over the net several times in his defeat by Mischa Zverev and walked back to his chair before his opponent’s serve had landed. He’s also agreed to an ATP plan that he see a sports psychologist. Weather Mainly fine with light variable winds. Top temperature 21 degrees Celsius. Overnight lows of 14 degrees on the coast and 9 degrees inland with clear skies. Wednesday and Thursday-Fine tomorrow,sunshine and showers on Thursday.   Finally 85 year old Canadian Ed Whitlock has completed the Toronto marathon setting a new world record in his age category.  Whitlock crossed the finish line after 3hrs 56min 38sec on Sunday breaking the previous world record in the 85-90 age category of 4h 34min 55sec.           Advertisement Homepage Features News What's on guide Giveaways Videos Advertisers Contact Us Copyright - RIVIERA RADIO | Design & SEO by I2N

He was 58. The cause was a heart attack, a company spokesman said. Schafer formed SCC with his roommate from the University of Iowa, Tim Condon, in 1989. "He was my college roommate, the best man at my wedding, the godfather of my son," Condon told Crain's. "He was my best friend and one of the nicest people I have ever known." Condon recalled the kindness and warmth with which Schafer treated SCC employees. When Schafer interviewed Suzanne Martineau, today an executive creative director at SCC, the meeting lasted three hours and expanded beyond a job interview to a wide-ranging discussion about life and values, according to Condon. "He always put people in front of profit," he said. Former clients with whom SCC had not worked since 1990 showed up to today's memorial service, a testament to Schafer's talent for maintaining friendships, Condon said. Schafer grew up in Roscoe, near Rockford. He began his career in 1984 on the account service side at Mandabach & Simms, a Chicago agency that focused on foodservice clients. The agency was sold to Ketchum Communications in 1987 and is today part of holding company Omnicom Group, based in New York. He moved to San Francisco and switched to the creative side of the business, working as a copywriter and creative director for brands such as Nestle before coming back to Chicago and launching SCC. West Loop-based SCC grew steadily, garnering accounts including Allen Edmonds, the Chicago Cubs, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo. Today, SCC employs more than 100 people. Schafer most recently served as COO before retiring in 2014 and assuming the chairman emeritus title. A longtime Glenview resident, Schafer and wife Katie recently purchased a farm in Lyndon Station, Wis., where they were living at the time of his death. In a statement, the agency said Mark was "a brilliant artist and creative executive" who also happened to be "a kind, calm and rock-solid individual who inspired colleagues and clients alike.” Schafer Condon Carter Advertising and Marketing Today's Crain's Get our daily roundup of important business news.

Beauty Inc., the cosmetics company that went public on Sept. 22, has a business process that analysts at Cowen & Company describe as a “‘fast fashion’ execution,” one of many reasons to have a positive outlook on the company’s future. “E.L.F.’s low price points (average unit retail at Walmart/Target is about $2 to $3) combined with millennial, multicultural, and beauty enthusiast appeal should drive a combination of distribution and comp growth,” analysts wrote in a note published Monday. Cowen initiated E.L.F. ELF, -0.27%   at outperform on Monday with a $32 price target. It’s one of a number of initiations, and analysts are bullish about the newly public company. See also: 5 things to know about E.L.F. Beauty Cowen says E.L.F. can “deliver product to market in as little as 20 weeks, versus traditional cosmetics companies where it takes 24 months.” That is one of five factors for its upbeat note, including low market share with a high threshold for growth, a focus on product innovation that creates demand, and a younger customer base (46% are between the ages of 18 and 34) who are highly engaged. Analysts at Stifel also highlight the company’s growth potential, with expanding store distribution at both existing and new retailers just one reason to be optimistic. Among the retailers selling E.L.F. products are Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -0.48%  , Target Corp. TGT, -0.31%   and CVS Health Corp. CVS, -0.34%  , along with its own stores and online platform. “The company has significant white space in the U.S. market and longer-term potential internationally, in our view, particularly given its value proposition for national retailers, which make up over 80% of revenues,” analysts wrote in a Monday note. “Although we have no knowledge of any M&A negotiations or discussions, we believe E.L.F. is an attractive acquisition target given favorable category trends and domestic and international white space, providing down-side protection to E.L.F. shares in the near-to-medium term,” the note also said. Analysts believe Coty Inc. COTY, +0.40%   would be the most logical buyer due to its focus on sales growth and scale after acquiring a number of Procter & Gamble Co. PG, -0.97%   fragrance licenses. See also: Coty buys hair straightener maker Ghd J.P. Morgan said that it’s optimistic about the multi-year outlook for E.L.F. not only for the reasons outlined by Cowen and Stifel, but also because the company’s website “lowers marketing spend and enables an asset-light model with fast go-to-market innovation.” Greater use of social media is also facilitating a rise in the use of makeup. “The ‘selfie’ generation wants to look good, is less loyal to prestige brands and is highly influenced by bloggers, and online reviews,” the note said. “We view the company as a clear disruptor in an attractive industry.” See also: ‘The Amazon effect’ and 3 other things to watch for this holiday shopping season Shares of the company are up about 60% in Monday trading from the $17 public offering price. J.P. Morgan analysts say the spike in share price, plus a third quarter that will likely be difficult, are reasons to “wait for a better entry point.” J.P. Morgan rates E.L.F. shares neutral with a $28 price target. The beauty company was also started at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey at buy with a $32 price target. E.L.F. stock is down 3.6% for the month to date, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.22%   is down 1.8% for the same period.

Coty has snapped up the hair straightener and hairdryer manufacturer from private equity firm Lion Capital, which is understood to have put the company up for sale earlier this year. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments The all-cash deal is expected to be sealed by the end of 2016, if it wins the backing of regulators. Camillo Pane, Coty chief executive, said: " Not only do we expect GHD to strengthen our professional hair portfolio and enable Coty to provide even better hair solutions, but we also believe there is strong growth potential for GHD across several markets." The move for GHD, which stands for good hair day, comes just two weeks after Coty secured a merger with Procter & Gamble's Speciality Beauty Business. GHD notched up revenues of £178 million in the 2015-16 financial year across its international operations in Europe, Australia, South Africa and the US. Lyndon Lea, partner of Lion Capital, said: "Over the three years of our ownership, GHD grew worldwide sales by 30% through a strong pipeline of innovative new products, which deepened the brand's leadership in its core markets and supported its successful entry into new hairstyling categories." US and Asian companies are said to have ramped up their interest in British firms as they look to capitalise on sterling's collapse following the EU referendum result. However, it is unclear whether sterling's 18% drop against the US dollar since the Brexit vote had any bearing on Coty's decision. Coty is one of the world's largest beauty companies, with 9 billion US dollars (£7.4 billion) in revenues.

The business has increased global sales 30 percent over the past three years, bringing in 178 million pounds in revenue during fiscal year 2016, according to a statement on Monday. GHD sells hair straighteners, dryers and curlers at salons and high-end retailers, as well as online. The deal marks Coty’s first acquisition since it completed the purchase earlier this month of 41 Procter & Gamble Co. beauty brands, including Gucci fragrances, CoverGirl cosmetics and Max Factor makeup. That deal made Coty the world’s third-biggest cosmetics company and the largest in fragrance. The GHD transaction takes advantage of the British pound’s decline, said Jason Gere, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. Still, it means one more thing for Coty to digest. “It does add another element to an increasingly full plate for management to handle right now,” he said. Coty shares gained 0.4 percent to $23.43 in New York on Monday. The stock had declined 8.9 percent this year through the end of last week. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 17, 2016 9:08am   Comments Share: Related Wall Street's M&A Chatter From November 11-13 20 Biggest Mid-Day Losers For Wednesday Michael Burry (Of The Big Short) Adds To Oversold Names (Seeking Alpha) An article by Sky News suggested that Coty Inc (NYSE: COTY) is in talks to acquire Good Hair Day [GHD], a UK-based manufacturer of high-end hair care products, for substantially more than £400 million. The potential acquisition would offset about half of the dilution from Coty’s planned brand divestitures and boost total sales growth by ~30bps, Barclays’ Lauren Lieberman said in a report. Analyst Lieberman maintained an Equal-weight rating on Coty, with a price target of $28. She mentioned that the price suggested exceeds $468 million using the current exchange rate. While the Sky News article indicated that the deal could be announced as early as later in October, there have been no official comments regarding the potential acquisition. Bigger Than Expected “While it is widely known that Coty intends to build out its beauty portfolio via acquisition less than a month after the RMT with P&G Specialty Beauty, a potential deal for GHD would surely be sooner and bigger than expected,” Lieberman commented. There has been concern around dilution from Coty’s panned exit of 6-8 percent of pro-forma sales. The analyst stated that the divestiture could add ~100bps to total company growth, while the potential GHD acquisition may add another ~30bps to the top-line growth rates.

Prior to his appointment at Snapdeal, which is run by Jasper Infotech Pvt. Ltd, Desai spent nearly three years at Groupon as a vice president where he led product and engineering functions, encompassing aspects like logistics management, seller and interface experiences. Before Groupon, Pradeep spent 11 years at e-tailer Amazon.com, where he worked in various capacities across key departments such as logistics, advertising and marketing. He is an alumnus of The University of Texas at Austin and IIT Madras. “Pradeep will lead a team whose mandate is to implement a range of additional supply chain innovations to Snadeal’s delivery experience. All our initiatives bring us closer to our mission of building India’s most reliable and frictionless commerce ecosystem.” said Rajiv Mangla, chief technology officer at Snapdeal, on the appointment. In May, Snapdeal’s chief product officer (CPO) Anand Chandrasekaran had quit the company. He has now joined social network website Facebook to help develop strategies for its Messenger app. In April this year, Snapdeal hired former Zoomcar executive Mayank Jain as head of growth. Zoomcar is a self-drive car rental startup. Last year, Snapdeal appointed Jeyandran Venugopal from Yahoo! as its technology adviser. Other high level appointments include Procter & Gamble executive Amit Choudhary who became senior vice president of corporate finance and former Unilever executive Vivek Patankar who was hired as senior vice president of finance. Snapdeal recently rebranded itself by launching a new logo and tagline ‘Unbox Zindagi’. It also launched next-day free delivery and a private cloud service called Snapdeal Cirrus. Last month, Snapdeal established a wholesale unit, called E-Agility Pvt. Ltd., to buy products that will be sold to consumers directly, following in the footsteps of rivals Flipkart and Amazon. The unit will fund vendors and bring on board fashion brands that sell directly to e-commerce firms as fashion constitutes 20-30% of Snapdeal’s business. Like this report?

Business James Ashton: 'Safe hands' Carney should stay in London James Ashton Monday 17 October 2016 11:14 BST Mark Carney should stay in London, where the action is PA It would reflect poorly on Mark Carney if the spat that has developed between Downing Street and the Bank of England convinces him not to extend his tenure in Threadneedle Street. “Brits don’t quit” hasn’t got quite the ring to it that it used to have but surely Canadians have more staying power? The Bank Governor is rightly miffed that Theresa May would challenge his stewardship, specifically the side-effects of ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing on savers. As politicians squabbled in the days after the Brexit vote, Carney was the only authority figure taking decisive action to shore up the economy. As soon as May has found her stride, this is the thanks he gets. But authority figures should expect to be challenged from time to time. The trouble is that Carney, the UK’s most powerful unelected figure, hasn’t faced much opposition to his leadership since he arrived in summer 2013, dictating terms immediately. Not for him the eight-year posting that was advertised. Instead, demonstrating extraordinary bargaining power, he said he would serve five. Now that Carney is mulling whether to put in the eight-year term after all, he will have noted the weather has changed. Although the tension is nothing like that which existed when Alistair Darling and Mervyn King were handling the financial crisis together, gone are the cordial relations Carney enjoyed with George Osborne as both benefited from an early economic revival. It was thought the only woman who would influence his decision to stay in London would be his wife, Diana. When Carney was appointed, she told her Twitter followers that “we’ll be back in 5”. The Prime Minister — who is free to alter the Bank’s mandate — should weigh in too and urge him to remain. Not only is Carney viewed as a safe pair of hands but, as chairman of the Financial Stability Board, he also brings a valuable international dimension just as the UK is refashioning its role on the world stage. More importantly, he must be up for it. At the annual Mansion House bankers’ dinner a couple of years ago, he joked about one of his predecessors, Montagu Norman, who fled to Quebec just as the sterling crisis forced the UK off the gold standard. Given the uncertainty of Brexit, I can see why academics might consider deserting for bigger research grants in the US, or car manufacturers might weigh up the Eastern European option.  But for a central banker, given what the UK must go through over the next few years, London is surely where the action is. Where real threat from Unilever lies Last week’s Marmite wars brought to mind a conversation with Google co-founder Larry Page several years ago.  Rather than boasting about his hand in creating a multi-billion-dollar game-changer, he compared his business to making toothbrushes. Page’s entrepreneurial advice was: keep it simple, sell something that people will use every day, take a small cut and go global. Until now, I couldn’t see much of a connection between technology and grocery, other than filling out the weekly Ocado order. But the row with Tesco, caused by Unilever’s suggested blanket 10% price increase to compensate for the weak pound hitting the cost of its raw materials, is just one part of a bigger skirmish. Short of top-line growth since emerging markets cooled, grocery groups are convinced that cutting out the middle-man retailer would be great for business. For Unilever, Procter & Gamble and the rest, utilising e-commerce might just be the biggest innovation since consumers stopped taking two bottles into the shower. Going direct-to-consumer has disintermediated everything from record labels to travel agents in the past decade and its impact is already noticeable in the supermarket aisles. Nestlé made a splash by selling its Nespresso capsules direct, and few would have thought Graze, a snacks-by-post outfit, would have progressed sufficiently for US private-equity group Carlyle to gobble it up. Unilever chief Paul Polman made a big noise in summer about his purchase of the disruptive Dollar Shave Club, which won 5% of the US razor blade market in only three years with a monthly delivery service. He told analysts the e-commerce model could be applied to 30% of his company’s product range, especially its skincare lotions and potions. Polman is gambling on what used to be known as mail order going mainstream. During its third-quarter earnings call last week, Unilever disclosed that in China e-commerce was 3% of sales two years ago but today accounts for more than 10%.  Instead of funding promotions in supermarkets where footfall is falling, why shouldn’t Polman do it himself, and at the same time keep hold of the valuable consumer data that is logged on the retailer’s loyalty card? If he is successful, Tesco will have more to worry about than simply passing on price rises.

Everstone has interests in food businesses, real estate parks, industrial warehouses and so on. Photo: Abhijit Bhatlekar/Mint Mumbai: About seven years ago, when Sameer Sain was raising funds for Everstone Capital Management’s second private equity (PE) fund (Everstone Capital Partners II), the former managing director at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. got turned down by an investment manager of a university endowment fund who came very close to making an investment but eventually balked. The endowment fund chose a lesser- known rival over Everstone, the investment management firm Sain founded with his former Goldman Sachs colleague Atul Kapur in 2006. The decision baffled Sain and Kapur. A few days later, in a casual meeting in Hong Kong with the investor, Sain found out the reason. It wasn’t what they expected. “I get the feeling that you and Atul are too Goldman Sachs, very confident, in your expensive suits and watches, you seem to have an articulate answer for everything. Basically you come across as too slick while the other guys seem more real and humble,” was what the manager told them. Since then, Sain has more than proved his fundraising prowess. Everstone has assets under management in excess of $3.3 billion across PE and real estate. This, in a short span of 10 years, is no mean achievement. The rise of the firm has certainly caught the eye of peers and the perception is that Everstone is a fundraising machine. Sain disagrees. “The perception that we are a great fundraiser is wrong,” he says. “The marquee global LPs (limited partners), many of whom are our investors, are much smarter than you think. They are committing to a manager in a blind pool for a very long time with no liquidity. A lot of work and thought goes into the decision on which manager to back.” Everstone has assets under management of about $3.3 billion across private equity and real estate “I would be a great fundraiser if I had a seven- or eight- person team, sat in a small office with minimal infrastructure and skin in the game, and then raised $3 billion. Currently I would say I’m a poor fundraiser: I put more money in my funds than almost all my peers, I have the largest team of talented people with whom I share economics, five offices with massive infrastructure and overheads, and a very stable, solid firm,” adds Sain. “All the players in our industry charge the same fees but each one is very different. It’s analogous to all the cars in the showroom being the same price. At Everstone we have built a Ferrari but we charge the same as someone offering a Fiat. And yes, I accept that a Ferrari is slick,” quips Sain, taking a jibe at that investment manager while recounting the incident. “Atul and I are not going to apologize,” he says, adding, “We have years of strong experience at a global firm like Goldman Sachs and almost 100% of our own hard-earned money is invested alongside our investors.” There is merit in what Sain says. The duo, who quit their jobs at Goldman Sachs in 2006 to start Everstone, have invested several million dollars of their own in their funds. In addition, they have invested a huge amount on their platform and on talent. "I would say I’m a poor fundraiser: I put more money in my funds than almost all my peers, I have the largest team of talented people with whom I share economics, five offices with massive infrastructure and overheads, and a very stable, solid firm"- Sameer Sain, co-founder, Everstone Capital Such commitment is seen as a stamp of faith in the asset management industry and goes down very well with limited partners (LPs), or the investors in a fund. “Skin in the game”, as it is referred to in industry parlance, is fast becoming a norm and being embraced by quite a few fund managers. But the quantum of their personal commitment definitely stands out. “Atul and I both worked at Goldman Sachs for 11-12 years each. We met back in 1994 and have been close friends since. We always had the ambition to become entrepreneurs and start our own firm and were lucky that we worked at a meritocratic firm where we did very well and were compensated accordingly. In addition, like many of our peers, we benefited from shares and options when Goldman went public and thus had sufficient capital at an early stage in life to go and take some risks,” says Sain. In 2006, the two partners set up two businesses—one was an asset management business, dealing in PE and real estate; the second was a financial services business. “We did both in partnership with the Future Group. I had an old family relationship with Kishore Biyani and that is how we started this business,” recalls Sain. The relationship, however, did not last long. He adds: “A couple of years into this partnership we took Future Capital public, but we had a different view of how we should proceed in life. So, in a very amicable way, we parted ways. We bought out their share in the asset management business. Over time we started to sell our shares in Future Capital in the market. Eventually that business got sold to Warburg Pincus. In 2006, Sain and Kapur set up two businesses—asset management, dealing in PE and real estate, and financial services “We brought the brand of our overseas business (Everstone) to India and rebranded our operations here and eventually became one regional brand—the Everstone Group,” says Sain. A broken relationship is now a thing of the past. It was, in fact, the genesis of the entrepreneurial powerhouse in the making and one which already has global aspirations. “Everstone is only 10 years old. We started in a small office in London where Atul and I were based. Very quickly we opened five offices (Mumbai, Singapore, Bengaluru, Delhi and Mauritius). Ironically, we shut London eight years ago and physically moved to Asia. Next month, after so many years, we are about to open an office in London to support some cross-border investments and business development,” says Sain. Everstone has four lines of business today: PE, real estate, credit and consumer venture. Click here for enlarge “We are over 200 people across five offices. Headquartered in Singapore, regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (the country’s central bank). Atul and I are both residents of Singapore. The largest office is Mumbai where we have about 80-100 people. And we have a very stable firm, which we have built very carefully over the last 10 years,” says Sain. While Sain and Kapur are the co-founders of the business, it already has a second and third layer in place. “Everstone has built a highly institutionalized platform which operates like the corporate nerve centre of a business group,” says Dhanpal Jhaveri, a managing partner who leads the firm’s PE business. Rajesh Jaggi is managing partner of the real estate business. At the other end of the spectrum, P.M. Devaiah, a partner and general counsel, leads a team of lawyers to ensure that the firm is well protected and functions smoothly. Everstone has four lines of business today: private equity, real estate, credit and consumer venture “We have a lot of trust and faith in each other. As an example, Rajesh Jaggi is not only my partner but also the best real estate investor and developer in India. I trust him 100%, so why should I second-guess him. This trust and culture brings out the best in our people and allows them to excel,” says Sain. PE is essentially a business by the LPs, of the LPs and for the LPs. And what do LPs really want: GPs (general partners) who can repeat and institutionalize success, who can build consistency, legacy and an institutional framework for repeatability, who can incentivize the team well for a long-term alignment, who have the “desire to be successful” as opposed to just being “transaction oriented” and those who have good infrastructure for effective LP communication. “Everstone is building its private equity business in an institutional manner. We have not seen many private equity firms do this. They think along the lines of building long-term businesses, which we like,” says Nupur Garg, regional lead (South Asia) at International Finance Corporation (IFC), part of the World Bank group. IFC is one of the biggest global investors in India, backing roughly two-thirds of the active growth funds investing in unlisted small and mid-cap companies. Click here for enlarge Also, diversity is a key ingredient in the Everstone talent mix—multiple nationalities across its various offices with 30% of its senior team comprising women (seven out of 24 managing or executive directors). The women too have a multinational and global background like Roopa Purushothaman, a former Goldman Sachs senior economist, and Bhavna Thakur, a former director at Citibank and a qualified international lawyer. “Everstone’s ethos of being a business builder adds intrinsic value to our portfolio companies by providing leverage to the portfolio in every aspect of business: whether it be research, branding, marketing, operations, capital markets or mergers and acquisitions,” says Thakur, Everstone managing director for capital markets. “This enables strategic alliances and market intelligence.” "Everstone is building its private equity business in an institutional manner. We have not seen many private equity firms do this. They think along the lines of building long-term businesses, which we like"- Nupur Gard, regional head (South Asia) at IFC Within PE, the firm uses the brand Everstone Capital which is currently investing out of its third fund. The first fund was in partnership with Future Group and called Indivision. The second was Everstone Capital Partners II. The third is Everstone Capital Partners III. The firm currently manages about $2 billion and about $2.3-2.4 billion in actual investments made, including the co-investments. Like any PE firm’s portfolio, Everstone also has its share of the good, the bad and the ugly. “We have our share of challenges from the first fund while fund II is in great shape. We have some fantastic businesses in there, some real winners, including businesses such as IndoStar Capital, Hinduja Leyland Finance, S. Chand and Ozone Overseas. Fund II is going to end up being a strong performer and fund III has gotten off to a good start,” says Sain. He is candid about the first fund’s portfolio and admits that it was a learning curve for them. The firm currently manages about $2 billion and about $2.3-2.4 billion in actual investments made, including the co-investments “Future Group’s e-commerce—the first e-commerce business we backed with Sherpalo and Kleiner Perkins. Probably too early, it’s almost never that a bricks-and-mortar operator enters e-tailing and beats an independent e-commerce player. We thought it would be different in India but we were wrong. Billimoria & Co. was a massive disappointment too. There was a time we could have sold that business for three-four times our investment but in my view we took a bet on the wrong people, besides the cycle was bad for all EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) companies. So we sold that business, we lost half of our money. Moved on,” says Sain. Bad bets are part of the game but seeing Sain being candid about them is unusual in the world of PE. “Both Atul and I have a mindset of control and execution. We shifted that in our first fund because the idea was to go buy into consumer businesses as minority and work with our ex-partner (Future Group) to provide them a distribution platform,” he says. “So we went back to our roots to do what we knew best. Buy businesses, roll up your sleeves and get things done. Execute and build businesses—as we have done with Burger King, ReGen Powertech or with IndoStar—but never ever ignore that there are great people and franchises out there who you can trust and back,” adds Sain. And these are not mere words. Sain is on top of every minuscule activity happening at these firms. He takes out a mobile-like device from the pocket of his blue jacket and takes us through a dashboard on screen where you can see every live cash transaction from every terminal in every Burger King outlet in India. “We control the brand of Burger King for almost 20% of the world population,” asserts Sain, his face lighting up with the sheer joy of ownership. "We went back to our roots to do what we knew best. Buy businesses, roll up your sleeves and get things done. Execute and build businesses, but never ever ignore that there are great people and franchises out there who you can trust and back"- Sameer Sain “There are businesses that we like to control but these businesses need to have science behind them. We bought Modern Bread from Unilever. It came with 60,000 distribution points. Its been a phenomenal one-and-a-half years of headache. We had to carve out the factories, people, the labour union. How many people in India can do that?” he says. “No CEO/CFO, a strong labour union, manufacturing plants in seven different locations and a non-cohesive business culture. We played a video in eight different languages at eight different manufacturing plants about the Everstone Group— to appeal to the factory workers about how their future will be bright with us. (To tell them) what our ambitions were and how we will take the brand back to its glory days,” points out Sain. Now that the hard work is done, it is beginning to bear fruit. “We will do cakes, rusk, cookies and other baked goods. We are going to grow that and make Modern into a Rs2,000-3,000 crore business,” he says. But then there are always some businesses which have more art than science to them. Which is where minority investing comes in, says Sain. "We control the brand of Burger King for almost 20% of the world population"- Sameer Sain, Everstone Group He says: “That’s my view on minority/control. It’s art vs science. If you look at fashion or winemaking, these businesses have a lot of art embedded in them. We own 34% of Ritu Kumar, where design and product selection plays such a vital role. Take Sula, for example. Winemaking is an art and Rajeev Samant is the best at it. That is why we made extraordinary returns by backing Rajeev and eventually exited that business. In such cases, our role changes to a minority investor who provides capital and business discipline. “Within food itself—we own and control Burger King in India—quick service and fast food is largely science with a big focus on quality, supply chain and customer engagement. All mostly science and execution, which is why we can own this business but still have an amazing CEO in Raj Varman. On the other hand, we only own 50% of Massive Restaurants and don’t have any day-to-day management involvement. The promoter and creator of this business, Zorawar Kalra, is a passionate genius. At the fine dining level, its art, not science,” adds Sain. Everstone Capital has invested Rs1,200 crore in F&B Asia, which has under its fold assets such as Pind Balluchi, Harry’s, the Disgruntled Chef, Pan India Food Solutions (also known as Blue Foods), Massive Restaurants, besides the franchise of Domino’s in Indonesia and Burger King in India and Indonesia, among others. “Blue Foods proved to us very early on—don’t try to run art. Outsource it to the artist and give them the structure and financial discipline to make money,” says Sain. Blue Foods operates brands like Spaghetti Kitchen, Copper Chimney, Gelato Italiano, the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, Bombay Blue, Noodle Bar and food courts Food Talk and Spoon. Everstone Capital has invested Rs1,200 crore in F&B Asia, which has under its fold Pind Balluchi, Harry’s, the Disgruntled Chef, Blue Foods and Massive Restaurants “Spaghetti Kitchen was a marque brand, but now with so many new entrants it has become an irrelevant brand. But having said that Gelato is an amazing brand, Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf is the only profitable premium coffee chain in India. Copper Chimney is still an institution. We had to reinvent Noodle Bar. Bombay Blue has a niche following,” notes Sain. “Blue Foods is not a problem, but it’s a disappointment that we will not make as much money as we would have liked. We have a phrase we use called ROTI (return on time invested). In the case of Blue Foods, the ROI (return on investment) may be good but the ROTI won’t be great,” he points out. Besides PE, Everstone has a very large real estate business primarily comprising a shopping mall business called Kshitij/Horizon and the industrials business called IndoSpace. The shopping mall business was started by Future Group originally but post the separation, this business came to Everstone. “We have funded 14 malls across India, of which 10 have been developed entirely by Everstone. We knew nothing about mall development and learnt it the hard way after we inherited the business. Despite so many mistakes early on, we came up the learning curve very quickly. At the end of the day, we’ve actually completed all of these malls and we have sold all of them. To have built and sold so many malls, I like to think we understand retail and real estate both relatively well,” says Sain. “For the IndoSpace business, we partnered with a very good bunch of folks in the US called the Realterm group,” he adds. Realterm is an industrial real estate firm that manages approximately $2.5 billion in assets across 300 operating and development properties in North America, Europe and India. “Co-founders Ken and John (Kenneth S. Code and John W. Cammett) are both very similar to Atul and I in both mindset and personality. They are a large logistics and warehousing developer and manager in the US. We have a great relationship with them,” explains Sain. The IndoSpace platform has so far raised $584 million across two funds to invest in building logistics parks. These include the IndoSpace Logistics Park I, raised in 2009 with a corpus of $240 million, and IndoSpace Logistics Park II, raised in 2014 with a corpus of $344 million. Using some leverage, the total investment has been almost $1 billion. IndoSpace’s portfolio includes 17 industrial and logistics park projects under operation and development across Mumbai, Pune, the National Capital Region, Bengaluru and Chennai. Its tenants include companies such as Amazon, L’Oreal, Procter and Gamble, Nissan, PepsiCo, DHL, Leoni, Steelcase, Kubota, Ericsson, Bosch, Delphi, Caterpillar, Adidas and Asian Paints. IndoSpace plans to invest an additional $1 billion in the country over the next five years. The additional investment will increase its development pipeline from around 20 million sq. ft currently to 50 million sq. ft. Sain explains: “Something that is very unique about Everstone is that we buy land, we get permissions, we design, construct, facility manage, lease, asset manage, finance—all in-house. We probably have as much if not more capability than most real estate developers in India. “So, at worst, we are a fully integrated real estate developer. At best, we are a little bit more than that because we are also a fund manager. “But any which way you look at it, the Everstone Group will be among the top five real estate developer groups in the country and one of the few truly national developers given the number of cities in which we operate,” he adds. Sain cites growth in consumption and e-commerce, and the unlocking of great manufacturing potential through government programmes such as Make in India, and removing the flux around the goods and services tax (GST) as reasons for its aggressive investment plans in the logistics space. "Something that is very unique about Everstone is that we buy land, we get permissions, we design, construct, facility manage, lease, asset manage, finance—all in-house"- Sameer Sain on Everstone’s real estate strategy He says: “When people hear of other real estate developers, they talk in awe, but not many people talk about us. We keep a low profile and industrial real estate is hardly a talking point. No one goes to Chakan and says, Wow! Look at this 3 million sq. ft industrial development, whereas you can see a 100,000 sq. ft building in Lower Parel and get all excited about it and that builder gets a lot more prominence. “But we are not here for prominence, we are here to make money for our investors. We are present in 17 cities—from Lucknow and Kochi where we have built malls to Chennai (Oragadum and Sriperumbudur) and Pune (Chakan) where we have developed large logistics facilities. “We are a national developer. We do everything in-house and we have no capital constraints. When you pay fees to a typical real estate fund manager, what they do is go and back other real estate developers with investor capital. So the developer has to make money, the fund manager has to make money and then the investor eventually gets the remainder. With us, the end investor benefits dramatically as we are an integrated developer and fund manager,” he says. In the credit business, the group has taken a slightly different approach. Rather than create a credit fund, given their experience with credit at Goldman Sachs, and the fact that they created Future Capital from scratch, they decided to do it in a non-banking financial company (NBFC) format. Sain recalls: “Four-and-a-half years ago, we capitalized a company from zero to about $200 million. We, along with some of our investors put in approximately $120 million and we brought in some partners like Goldman Sachs and Ashmore. We put in a great management team, and added all our experience, risk systems and credit processes. "The Everstone Group will be among the top five real estate developer groups in the country and one of the few truly national developers given the number of cities in which we operate"- Sameer Sain on Everstone’s real estate business “We started IndoStar with complex corporate lending and today that business segment accounts for over 60% of our Rs6,000 crore book. The rest comes from real estate and SME (small and medium enterprise) lending. The NBFC is looking to increase the SME book to Rs1,500 crore this year from around Rs400 crore last year. Since its launch in 2010, the NBFC’s loan book has grown at an average annual pace of 50%. “For the financial year 2015-16, the NBFC’s revenue increased 22% to Rs644 crore from Rs528 crore in the previous year. In 2015-16, it reported a net profit growth of 29% at Rs192 crore. Its net non-performing asset ratio was at 0.2%. “We started the SME business recently and it has gotten off to a good start. We also recently got our housing finance approvals and are about to embark on secured retail lending. Our real asset always remains our talent. That has always been the key to our success,” explains Sain. Everstone’s fourth business and one which is less known is its early-stage venture capital business. “It is a specialist business; it has a lot of art in it. In early-stage venture capital, because there is so much art and because the deal sizes are very small, we have adopted a slightly different approach,” says Sain. He explains: “We have formed an equal joint venture with Deepak Shahdadpuri, who we believe is the number one consumer venture capital investor, not just in India but also in South-East Asia. His track record is spectacular and we trust him 100%. Deepak runs DSG Consumer Partners with total independence but he has the entire Everstone ecosystem and platform at his disposal. “It is very unusual to have such a small fund (first fund was $22 million of which $4 million was Deepak’s and our capital) and be able to even afford decent office space and a team. But Deepak has five offices, a lot of talent, full infrastructure, total support so he can do what he does best—make great investments and nurture his young companies. For the investors in such a small fund this is an amazing proposition. Huge skin in the game with such a significant investment from the managers, a large stable platform, yet the art and nimbleness of an early-stage venture fund. Once again, a Ferrari for the price of a Fiat!” he adds. "We have formed an equal joint venture with Deepak Shahdadpuri, who we believe is the number one consumer venture capital investor, not just in India but also in South-East Asia. His track record is spectacular and we trust him 100%"- Sameer Sain on Everstone Group’s early-stage venture capital business According to Sain, their early-stage thesis has worked out really well. They are among the earliest investors in companies like Oyo, Mswipe, Veeba and Indialends. Over 70% of invested capital has been realized after just one whole and one partial exit. The fund is on track to deliver strong returns. “That fund is on track to deliver a five-seven times multiple of capital in a relatively short period of time,” he says. The early-stage fund is now about to sell stake in three companies at huge markups. “We are about to sell a small stake in three companies—at 17-18x.” It is also out to raise its second fund which is about to close soon. “We are oversubscribed because we don’t want to raise too much money. Out of the $35-40 million, about $5 million is partner commitment between us and Deepak,” says Sain. After giving us a clear road map on where each of these businesses is headed, Sain talks about what worries him the most: Perception. Perception about Everstone being great at fundraising and not so good at exits and investment. “This is simply not true. We are the only RE (real estate) fund from 2006 that has liquidated all its investments and returned capital to LPs,” insists Sain. "Don’t think of us as a traditional PE player. We are probably among India’s top restaurateurs, we are one of the largest real estate developers, etc."- Sameer Sain He admits that they are behind schedule on exiting from their first PE fund, but assures that they will be accelerating their pace. “We have sold around 35% of our positions, we should be at about 70%,”he says. Sain then starts giving us an overview of exit plans and the time frame for that. “There is a time to sell businesses. For example, we wanted to ensure that in a company like Centrum (Capital), we had strong leadership and management. With Jaspal Bindra showing up and putting his own capital into the business, we are confident that Centrum will go to a new level,” he says. Selling for the sake of selling is not on. Sain points out: “We have time. Over time we will sell our stake and we want to leave the businesses stable and in good hands. “VLCC has filed for an IPO (initial public offering) and that business has performed well for us despite the fact that most of its peers have blown up. It’s the clear market leader with a strong new CEO in place. McKinsey recently conducted a full strategic review and the company is in the midst of implementing the suggestions. “We have a few businesses that are behind but we will find a way and exit them,” says Sain. For him, Everstone Capital Management has gone beyond PE. It’s almost akin to an e-commerce company where technology is the underlying enabler. PE just serves as a conduit for it to achieve its ambitions of owning and building food businesses, real estate parks, industrial warehouses and so on. “Don’t think of us as a traditional private equity player. We are probably among India’s top restaurateurs, we are one of the largest real estate developers, we are among the top 10 financial services houses, we are the top educational publisher, etc. We look at our platforms and businesses through a competitive and strong operational lens,” says Sain. What also helps them achieve such goals is that their capital is flexible. For Sain, Everstone Capital Management has gone beyond PE. It’s almost akin to an e-commerce firm where technology is the underlying enabler Sain says: “We are not a sole India-focused fund where every company we buy must be in India. We have a lot of flexibility in our strategy and look for businesses which can benefit from a nexus with India and South-East Asia. Buying a business in the US and bringing the back-end to India is as exciting for us as buying a business in India and then exporting its goods or services to the US. “In our first fund we bought Faces, a Canadian colour cosmetics brand. Many years later, the brand is called Faces Canada, but India is its largest market. We also own a majority of Burger King and Domino’s in Indonesia and Harry’s in Singapore but a lot of the procurement decisions or which beverage partner we think is best are all centralized and synergized,” he adds. With over $3.3 billion in equity investments and a lot more using debt, Sain’s firm is also a significant foreign direct investment contributor to the country. “The business environment has improved a lot for us and we feel it at the ground level, especially in terms of business ease and local governments wanting to do the right things. In terms of our interactions with state and central governments, there is a keenness to bring in long-term stable foreign capital. And, of course, as the largest player in warehousing and logistics facilities, GST is going to be a big positive for us,” he says. "I expect us to be even more aggressive in terms investing over the next five years, much more aggressive than what we have been in the previous five years"- Sameer Sain on Everstone Group’s strategy going ahead “Talking purely economically, this government is doing a great job. That gives us the confidence to continue to deploy larger and larger pools of capital. I expect us to be even more aggressive in terms investing over the next five years, much more aggressive than what we have been in the previous five years,” says Sain. What next? “More of the same,” he adds.

By Rachel Strugatz on October 18, 2016 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk Pat McGrath Labs will launch Metalmorphosis 005 Nov. 15. Courtesy NEW YORK — Pat McGrath coined a new term for any metallic eye pigment she deems subpar. “What is the goldest of all gold that I can ever have in my kit? When I put a metallic [eye shadow] on I’m not looking for a local metallic…a local shadow claiming to be a metallic,” the makeup artist said Monday evening during a preview of Pat McGrath Labs’ fifth product, Metalmorphosis 005, at the Dream Hotel in Chelsea here. “That’s a new word for basic. Basic is ‘local.'” McGrath is very serious about eye shadow pigment, so much so that Metalmorphosis is an extension of her first product, the Gold 001 pigment that launched a year ago. It also marks the first time she has brought back one of her products after it has sold out. This time around, though, Gold 001 is being joined by her “sisters” silver, bronze and copper, McGrath said. Every kit comes with a cream shadow, a pigment in the same shade, a Mehron mixing liquid and a black, dual-ended liquid eyeliner (to achieve a bold or fine stroke). Each of the four Metalmorphosis 005 sets retails for $60, an Everything Kit containing all four colorways for $165, and a single Dual-Ended Marker for $24. The range will hit the makeup artist’s web site, Patmcgrath.com, on Nov. 15 and select Sephora doors and sephora.com on Nov. 22. Using her hand to test out each shade, she demonstrated that the liquid can be used to help the pigment go from dry to wet for a more saturated finish on the eye. She also suggested layering a light wash of cream shadow on the lid and then placing pigment on top, as well as applying pigment in a dramatic, winged cat-eye for a more “couture” look. For less of a statement, the product works well when brushed along the lash line as a liner or even just placed on the inner corners for a pop of metallic. It can also be used as lip, hair or body color, and mixing and matching colors is recommended. “It’s every eye I’ve ever done since I’ve started my career,” McGrath mused of the long-lasting liner and metal pigments, adding that, “[You put it on] and then you can’t get it off, I’m sorry. You can wear it for a few nights.” Metalmorphosis 005, billed as “metallurgic masterpieces,” follows the same code as her four previous launches: the makeup appeared on the runways during the most recent fashion week (in this case, the spring runways of Maison Margiela and Versace). And like each product that’s come before it, the four-piece eye set is available in limited release. McGrath, who is also the global creative design director at Procter & Gamble, is mum on numbers, but did say that production is considerably higher than when her first Gold 001 pigment came out last September. She confirmed that she started with a “very small amount” and upped production once Pat McGrath Labs partnered with Sephora on the distribution for the Skin Fetish 003 highlighting kits and Lust 004 glitter lip sets that were released on April 26 and Aug. 30, respectively. “There are no rules with labs,” she said when asked if she continued to keep up the cadence of doing five product launches a year.

Here&rsquo;s how to play it</p> <p>Jim Cramer plugged into the video game space and highlighted which gaming stocks investors should be playing right now.</p> Cramer Remix: The video game space is on fire. Here’s how to play it    Monday, 17 Oct 2016 | 7:00 PM ET | 01:34 Right now there is practically no other theme hotter than video games, Jim Cramer says. Restaurants and retailers have all reported that it has become very hard to entice consumers into their locations. This is just further evidence that people just want to stay home, watch TV, use social media and play games these days. "The video game space is on fire and you've got a ton of ways to play it," the "Mad Money" host said. For those who think games are only for kids, the numbers prove otherwise. Industry-trade group Entertainment Software Association reported that 63 percent of all U.S. households have at least one person who plays video games regularly, with the average gamer 35-years-old. Additionally, consumers spent $23.5 billion on gaming hardware, software and accessories last year. The biggest problem in the video game space is that there are so many options to invest in, Cramer said. Cramer's top picks were NVIDIA or Advanced Micro Devices for components, and Electronic Arts, Activision Blizzard or Take-Two Interactive for games, depending on an investor's risk profile. "The key takeaway … this is not a niche business, it is a mass entertainment business and it's growing — not shrinking — despite what older people might think," Cramer said. Jonathan Ernst | Reuters Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton at their first debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, Sept. 26, 2016. Cramer sees many reasons not to own stocks right now, as many investors believe that the future of the U.S. will be much worse than the past. "I am not making any kind of statement about the election in November. But I do think that the rancorous nature of the debate is putting a lid on stocks," he said. The world of investing has transformed into one where a tweet by Sen. Bernie Sanders has the power take down the entire drug group. Investors simply don't want to own the stocks anymore. They also don't want to own companies with international exposure when international trade is under the microscope from Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton wants to raise some taxes, Cramer said. Cramer also noted that the election year could drive the unpopularity of the group, and banks remain unpopular in Washington. He expects to see more regulation ahead in the wake of Wells Fargo's sales scandal. Bank of America reported on Monday that it earned a whopping $1.8 billion in consumer banking, with strong deposit growth that drove net interest income higher amid a decline in expenses. The stock quickly popped and then surrendered most of its gains on Monday. The stock basically did nothing. Abigail Stevenson | CNBC Sylvia Acevedo, Interim CEO of Girl Scouts Nutanix is the enterprise cloud software play that came public with a bang three weeks ago, and then fell more than 7 percent on Monday. From the start, investors pegged Nutanix as the best performing IPO of 2016, as it came public at $16 and spiked to $37 by the close on Sept. 30. Cramer isn't a fan, though. While Nutanix has a compelling concept and fantastic numbers, the problem is that the IPO was what Cramer calls a "sliver deal." That is when a company comes public, but sells just a tiny sliver of stock. This can cause an enormous spike out of the gate because demand outweighs supply for the stock. "I hate sliver deals. I hate them because they are setting you up for failure," Cramer said. Once the lockup expires in a few months, Cramer expects Nutanix to do a secondary offering. That will cause the supply of the stock to outstrip the demand, and the share price will likely get clobbered. Sylvia Acevedo, interim CEO of Girl Scouts, launched her first rocket into the clear skies of New Mexico when she was just a child to earn her science badge in Girl Scouts. That experience triggered a lifelong passion for science, and led her to earn an MBA in engineering from Stanford and become a rocket scientist. She is also the White House commissioner on the presidential initiative for Hispanic educational excellence. In an interview with Cramer, she said she aims for Girl Scouts to not only instill the mission of leadership into girls, but to become more technology-focused and teach how to code. "It is part of our culture to do technology, to learn how to code, to have hands on projects — whether it's creating fashionable wearables, or creating robots," Acevedo said. In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on a few caller favorite stocks: Procter & Gamble: "I like Procter. I'd like you to buy it a little bit cheaper, because I think it can come down to $84 or $85. But I think it's a good choice." Synchrony Financial: "That thing has come down too much. That's kind of attractive to me ... You know what's more attractive? If Visa sells off a couple of bucks. My charitable trust owns it. I think that Charlie Scharf [outgoing CEO] has got some personal things he has to attend to at home in New York, and that stock is coming down and that may be a better opportunity."
