FIR filed against expelled AIADMK MP Sasikala Pushpa Raveena Tandon: Want to keep my children away from over exposure Actress Raveena Tandon says she decided to keep her children away from paparazzi as she feels they are too young to come in the limelight.Nov 13, 2016, 02.59 PM IST Actress Raveena Tandon says she decided to keep her children away from paparazzi as she feels they are too young to come in the limelight. Raveena married film distributor Anil Thadani in 2004 and they have two children -- daughter named Rasha and son Ranbirvardhan. Raveena said, "My kids are small to think about films and their interest area. I have kept my kids away from over exposure (of the glamour world) that the other kids are getting, and becoming celebrities on social media much before they become teens. I want them (my kids) to grow as normal kids." With so much interest in the personal life of celebrities, the actress says it does get difficult to keep kids away from media glare. B'day: Raveena Tandon's unknown facts "I don't hide my kids. There is paparazzi around everywhere be it at airports or at school sports function you can't avoid that. But taking kids to premiere (of a film) is something that Anil (husband) and I avoid. There is a right time and age for them to get attention and handle it," she added. The 42-year-old actress said she is strict with her children when it comes to their studies. Raveena supports Seven Seas Academy, an initiative aiming to create awareness about brain development among children. Being a mother to four (two adopted) children, the actress understands the importance of brain development and nutrition for children. "As I am a mother they (Seven Seas Academy) do take my inputs seriously. It's not about selling a product we are genuinely interested in development of a child including brain development and nutritional value. "We all are expecting our kids to be smart but are we giving them proper nutrition, we need to take care of them from the right age," she added. The Seven Seas Academy announced a nationwide hunt for India's young masterminds. At the grand finale, Yuvraj Varma and Ravi Yadav from Chandigarh emerged as India's top masterminds, winning a full paid educational trip to NASA along with parents.

PROCTER & GAMBLE CO: PG STOCK IS SOLID GAINER Buz Investors PG Stock is Solid Gainer For stock chart enthusiasts, the long-term chart of consumer packaged goods company Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) tells the story of impressive sustainability and long-term performance that makes PG stock a staple for widow-and-orphan stock investors. Go around your home and I bet you have at least one of Procter & Gamble Co product lying around. Whether it's for body care or household needs, Procter & Gamble Co makes it. PG STOCK IS SOLID GAINER GREAT WIDOW-AND-ORPHAN STOCK PG Stock is Solid Gainer PG stock has been under some recent pressure, down from its 52-week high of $90.33, but there could be better times around the corner. If you believe in what President-elect Trump is selling, the country could be in for a period of economic renaissance, as wealth drives consumer spending higher. Since staging a 28% "V"-shaped rally from $64.00 in mid-September, Procter & Gamble stock has been gaining ground prior to the roadblock. If PG stock can hold up and attract buying support, we could see the stock rally to the $90.00 level. But even if a rally doesn't formulate immediately, Procter & Gamble stock could be held for the long-term while getting paid a dividend. Procter & Gamble Co needs to address its two straight fiscal years of declining revenues, however. There are estimates calling for some small growth in FY17 and FY18, which should help to support the PG stock price. This article was written by Richard Dambrosi for on .

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Nov 13, 2016 at 1:26PM Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) knows all about dividend raises. The consumer goods titan has hiked its payout in each of the last sixty years for one of the longest streaks in the stock market. Image source: Getty Images. Yet the rate of increases has gotten much smaller lately. In fact, shareholders haven't seen a boost to the payout rate since 2008, when it improved from 13% to 14%. In contrast, this year's increase was about as tiny as it could be -- less than 1%. Annual dividend raises. Data source: P&G financial filings, chart by author. There are good reasons to expect the dividend outlook to improve from here, though. Falling payout ratio In fiscal 2015, P&G's payout soaked up a dangerously high percentage of profits. The $2.59-per-share dividend swamped the $2.44 per share that the company produced in earnings, leading to a payout ratio significantly above 100%. That unsustainable situation got better over the last 12 months, but only slightly. The dividend amounted to over 70% of earnings in fiscal 2016, far ahead of the 50% figure that most blue-chip businesses aim for. Thus, it made sense for management to be conservative about their latest payout boost. PG Payout Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts. The payout ratio should continue improving even if core earnings don't grow quickly. That's because the two biggest drags against P&G's profits -- foreign currency swings and its brand divestment initiatives -- are both winding down and won't be pressuring reported earnings nearly as much. Faster growth Operating trends are improving as well. Organic sales growth was 1% in the first quarter of the year, rose to 2% in the second quarter, and reached 3% in the quarter that just closed. That momentum bolsters management's forecast calling for P&G's fiscal 2017 to mark its first uptick in annual organic sales growth in three years. Organic growth by calendar quarter. Image source: P&G investor presentation. Notably, the organic growth has been volume-driven lately, meaning that P&G didn't need to count on higher prices alone to pull revenue up. And for a change, the company is finally beating rivals. Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB), which competes with P&G's biggest brand, Pampers, last posted flat organic growth. P&G is still struggling to hold market share overall, but it is gaining share in some key categories, like diapers, and the pace of overall decline has improved. Lower costs P&G can't do much about a sales environment for consumer goods that seems likely to bump along at near zero growth. It has complete control over its costs, though, and that's one area where management has demonstrated great execution. The company has cut an average of $1.4 billion out of its annual cost of goods sold expenses in each of the last five years and executives plan to boost that figure to as much as $2 billion over the next five years. These big-time savings promise to push gross profit margin higher even if the industry logs another year of disappointing growth. And as a fundamentally more profitable business, P&G should be able to afford heftier dividend increases. With dividends taking up more than two-thirds of profits, it's not likely that investors will see a return to double-digit raises any time soon. However, the key financial and operating trends imply stronger growth ahead for patient income investors. In the meantime, brand divestments have left P&G absolutely flush with cash, most of which the company plans to shower on shareholders in the form of stock repurchases.

Ambitious Alibaba breaks new ground in online shopping November 14, 2016 01:00 By TIPPAWAN POCHEANGRAK THE NATION SHENZHEN, CHINA ALIBABA is bringing the world to the future of online shopping. On Friday, the Alibaba Group launched the world’s largest 24-hour online shopping event this year, in Shenzhen. There was a huge gala show and mega-sales surpassed 120 billion yuan in gross merchandise volume (GMV). In Shenzhen, where the 11.11 gala was held this year, more interactive features were added. The more than 100 million viewers could play director by sending feedback via smartphones to change what the stars do on stage.  “Alibaba is not lacking engineers or customer service representatives. We need economists, sociologists, people with integrated knowledge to deal with challenges,” Jack Ma, Alibaba’s executive chairman, said.  Live broadcasts and entertainment were used in the run-up to this year’s event. More than 600 international brands used Alibaba’s live-steaming capabilities to introduce their brands and 11.11 products got customer feedback in real time.  At Alibaba’s 11.11 Countdown Gala Celebration, consumers in front of the televisions could be seen shaking, scanning, chatting, browsing and buying with their mobile phones. Audiences could even vote in real time to guide the plot direction of the drama shows unfolding on the stage. Alibaba is showing that virtual reality shopping is not sci-fi.  From November 1 until Friday, consumers could demo Alibaba Buy+; the shoppers could browse products at eight virtual reality stores, including Macy’s, Target, Costco, P&G and others, with 360-degree views using a VR headset. There is no need for expensive headsets. At just 1 yuan, the “VR cardboard” can be connected to a smartphone which has been available at the Taobao Marketplace since October 21. Innovation in online shopping Alibaba has introduced innovation to enhance consumers’ online shopping with augmented reality and Omni-channel Commerce, a location-based augmented reality mobile game featuring the Tmall cat mascot called “Catch the Tmall Cat”. This Pokemon Go style mobile game drives consumers to physical shops such as KFC, Intime Shopping malls, Suning, Shanghai Disneyland and Starbucks.  Alibaba is working with more than 1 million offline stores across various product categories to present consumers with an integrated online-to-offline experience across products, members and services and a “See Now, Buy Now” initiative. As a core part of the fashion show, consumers could use a “Buy Now” button to order in real time everything they saw on the catwalk in the Tmall and Taobao mobile apps while watching the shows and could also watch a stream on Alibaba’s online video hub Youku.com to pre-order items. More than 1,000 products from 50 international brands were showcased including Adidas, GAP, Levi’s Burberry, Paul Smith, New Balance and others. When Alibaba’s 2016 11.11 Global Shopping Festival began, in the first 5 minutes total GMV settled through Alipay exceeded 6.8 billion yuan (Bt35 billion). The 11.11 is not just a purely Chinese affair – 235 countries and regions completed cross-border transactions during the festival. This year nearly 100,000 merchants, including 11,000 international merchants, participated. Adidas, Apple, Nike, Pampers, Phillips, Siemens and Uniqlo were among the most popular in their respective product categories. After 24 hours, total GMV settled 120.7 billion yuan in transactions that played out over Alibaba’s e-commerce platforms – mostly on B2C site Tmall.com and C2C site Taobao Marketplace, a 32-per-cent jump over last year, while order volumes recorded a new high with 175,000 orders in one second. This was not surprising, as it was the world’s largest sale. Alibaba’s festival stimulated spending of more than $14 billion in GMV last year. “It’s not thinking about ourselves as an ordinary company,” Jack Ma told a crowd of several hundred reporters shortly before the close of Alibaba’s 11.11 2016 mega-shopping event at Media Centre, Shenzhen Universiade Sports Centre “It’s about thinking of ourselves as an economy.” Alibaba is using technology and data to converge online and offline retail to move beyond simple transactions. “That’s why we’re not reporting quarterly GMV. It doesn’t represent our true identity, and over-emphasising it makes people just think about e-commerce,” Ma said.   Tags Alibaba Most Viewed TODAY LAST 7 Days LAST 30 Days Singaporeans are now using less electricity and water...

WV Delegate Cowles hired to head Morgan County Economic Developm - Business, Government Legal News from throughout WV Member Center: Create Account| Log In Manage Account| Log Out SITE SEARCHWEB SEARCH BY Home News Business Government Energy Law Opinion Lynne D. Schwabe Brooks McCabe Charlie Bowen John Brown Dolly Withrow Linda Arnold Government Law Energy SHOP About Us Job Openings WV Delegate Cowles hired to head Morgan County Economic Development Authority Posted: Thursday, November 10, 2016 6:56 PM EST Updated: Saturday, November 12, 2016 2:00 PM EST By Marla Pisciotta Photo courtesy of Daryl Cowles — Delegate Daryl Cowles, R-Morgan, shown here with his wife Nicole and 4 children, adds Executive Director of Morgan County Development Authority to his resume. Delegate Daryl Cowles, R-Morgan, a 10-year veteran of the Legislature, has taken the executive director position of the Morgan County Economic Development Authority. “There is a lot going on in Berkeley Springs,” the 46-year-old Cowles said. “A lot of plans have been made for development. I am looking forward to getting some of these projects across the finish lines.” Cowles is no stranger to the authority board. He has served on the board for a number of years and said a lot of good things can come from its works — small businesses and county infrastructure can reap the benefits. Some projects in the county are underway and others are in the works. Blue Ridge Community and Technical College now has a campus in Berkeley Springs for work force training and higher education. “We desperately need that in the county,” Cowles said. “It’s a 45-minute drive to Martinsburg. We are glad to have their presence in the county.” Morgan County is developing a partnership with Procter & Gamble to build a lab in the former Pines Center Hospital.  Another big expansion is planned for Cacapon State Park. Related story: Media center grows in Morgan County, WV “Plans are to build 79 new rooms at the lodge, work on the golf course and work on the sewer plant,” Cowles said. He said the sewer plant was authorized three years ago by the Legislature, but Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin has not yet authorized the bond sale. “I think the financial outlook of the state right now is holding up that decision,” Cowles said. “Hopefully finances will straighten out and we’ll be able to get that project done.” The county also is talking with Mountaineer Gas about a natural gas line going into the county. “Currently we have zero natural gas availability in Morgan County,” Cowles said. Cowles said the application for the gas project has been filed with the West Virginia Public Service Commission. Related story: WV House of Delegates passes flood funding bill “Natural gas would allow bigger companies that require that type of energy to consider locating in Morgan County,” Cowles said. Smaller projects in the county include streetscaping in downtown Berkeley Springs, and new Tractor Supply Co. and Dollar General stores have located in the county. A native of Morgan County, Cowles has served on several regional economic groups, including West-pep and Region 9 Planning and Development Council. Cowles also serves as Majority Leader in the House of Delegates for District 58, Morgan and part of Hampshire counties. For the past 26 years, Cowles has managed his family owned construction and masonry firm. “I will be giving up the family business and concentrating on economic development and my job as Delegate,” Cowles said. Cowles is a graduate of Berkeley Springs High School, is married to his wife Nichole and has four children.

It’s a fascinating trend: bosses inviting tech-savvy youngsters to be their mentors. So did it work for top advertising executive Kate?  Kate Stanners finds out if a 25-year-old can help run her life She is chairwoman and global chief creative officer of Saatchi & Saatchi The exective is being reverse mentored by Lucy Lyall Grant By Liz Hoggard for the Daily Mail Published: 18:35 EST, 13 November 2016 | Updated: 19:33 EST, 13 November 2016 e-mail 244 shares 307 View comments Kate Stanners is chairwoman and global chief creative officer of Saatchi & Saatchi Kate Stanners oozes confidence and charisma. Dressed in trousers and a jumper by designer Bella Freud, her blonde curls tumbling over her shoulders, the 53-year-old looks like a Hollywood actress (although, as a working mother, she has little time to worry about her appearance). As chairwoman and global chief creative officer of Saatchi & Saatchi, she commands a six-figure salary and is one of the most senior women in British advertising. Her adverts include the Cadbury Flake ‘girl in the bath’ and T-Mobile’s ‘Royal Wedding ad’ — the most viewed of 2011. One minute, she’s briefing an art director on how to improve a campaign, the next juggling school commitments for her 13-year-old son, Otto, and organising her mother’s 80th birthday. It is, she says, important to wrap the presents herself. But, like many older bosses, she has one increasingly conspicuous weakness. She’s hopeless when it comes to tech. ‘I’m of the generation of women where you didn’t learn to type because, if you did, that would mean you were going to be a secretary. It was a rebellion not to,’ she says, then admits: ‘Everyone laughs because I’m absolutely inept technically.’ Partly, it’s impatience. But also, she says, it’s patronising to tell women over 50 to ‘keep up’. ‘Technology is there to make life easier, isn’t it? When it’s making life more complicated, either you’re doing something wrong or the technology isn’t very good — so you don’t need to worry about it.’ RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Marrying my 'crazy' Earl helped me overcome being raped: The... Donatella Versace claims that gay male fashion designers... From Ab Flab to Ab Fab! Actress Helen Lederer sheds eight... Woman with alopecia who has been single for FIVE YEARS fears... Share this article Share 244 shares But she also sees the irony of a situation where smart fiftysomething women who run multi-million-pound business empires are stumped when booking a blow-dry by app, or changing their credit card details on taxi app Uber. And she also recognises how getting savvier about tech can free up valuable family time. Which is why today — for one day only — she is handing over the bossing baton to a 25-year-old upstart who knows virtually nothing about advertising. Kate has agreed to try out reverse mentoring, the latest trend to which more and more top bosses are signing up. Many of us have had ‘mentors’ in our lives, of course — but, generally, they’re older than us. ‘Reverse mentoring’ flips this idea on its head: young people, often in their 20s, offer training and advice to older workers. The idea is that those much younger than us can shake up our entrenched views and offer a new approach to problem-solving. And, crucially, reverse mentoring can plug the generational knowledge gap when it comes to technology — as anyone who has begged their teenage kids to help them set up a flat-screen TV knows all too well. Picturred, Saatchi exectuive Kate Stanner and Free Formers Mentor Lucy Lyall Grant Over the past two years or so, companies such as L’Oreal, Starbucks, Deloitte and John Lewis have all started pairing up millennials with workers in their 40s or 50s to give them a fresh way of thinking. In 2013, Barclays, for example, ordered 10,000 iPads for staff, only to find no one knew how to use them. They had to set up teams of younger ‘digital eagles’ to coach the older staff. So successful has reverse mentoring become that a new breed of twentysomething mentors has sprung up, who will come into your office and train you to think digitally. And new research shows women are benefiting most from the formal face-to-face schemes than any other digital training. Kate’s mentored many young women in advertising, but she’s not used to those fresh-faced millennials telling her what to do. It could be an awkward moment when she meets her reverse mentor, 25-year-old Lucy Lyall Grant. But armed with a big smile, Lucy quickly puts Kate at her ease. Dressed in jeans, stripey T-shirt and Nike trainers with a pair of headphones round her neck, Lucy speaks fluent tech (in both French and English). A trainer at a digital training company called Freeformers — which counts bosses at Barclays, Tesco and the BBC as former clients — she is at the beginning of her career. She rents a tiny house with three female friends and is on call 24/7 (social media never sleeps). As her company has no formal offices, she either works remotely from home or in a coffee shop. What’s so great about a reverse mentoring session, she explains, is that ‘I can help older workers with the newest apps and train them to be more “techy”. I help them re-organise their life.’ Gently, Lucy explains why Kate needs to engage more with social media. She finds Twitter a great tool for networking Lucy also shows them how to protect themselves against fraud. ‘They understand the importance of data, so want to know about cyber security and passwords. They want to know how to better use their iPhone and book more things online (food, flights, shopping, banking) to save time.’ Funnily enough, she adds, the CEOs with families want to learn more about tech ‘to wow their kids or, at least, better understand what their kids are doing online’. The first thing Lucy does with Kate is look at her office, full of art books, discarded computer equipment and advertising awards. Kate’s a self-confessed messy thinker. ‘I’ve always excused myself that I haven’t got a very efficient brain.’ Lucy is meeting Kate at a time of peak chaos in her life. She, her husband and her 13-year-old son, Otto, along with their wire fox terrier, Rocky, are living in a temporary house while they wait to move home. Meanwhile, Saatchi’s is moving into new, state-of-the-art offices on the other side of London, so everything is being packed up. Never the most organised person — her mantra is ‘I’m better in the moment than in the preparation’ — Kate knows she relies too much on her son. Even when he was very little, Otto learned to stand at the door and say to her: ‘Phone, Oyster card, keys, credit card’, knowing she’d have forgotten one of them. ‘Poor thing, having to worry about your mother being so disorganised,’ she admits. Otto’s also leagues ahead of his mother when it comes to tech. At Saatchi’s, Kate increasingly has to do interviews via video-calling service Skype and often views the latest adverts on her iPhone, but she still watches in awe as Otto sorts out the ringer on his grandmother’s smartphone. Kate needs her phone to be more of a PA, Lucy observes: ‘There is actually an online PA now called x.ai (https://x.ai/), which our own boss at Freeformers uses. She’s called Amy and she’s good at organising meetings, etc. ‘The best thing I do on my own phone is set automatic reminders for meetings, events, holidays, etc. It sends me reminders ten minutes before any event, so I never forget. WHAT YOU COULD LEARN SAVE MONEY: Cash-strapped millennials make their money work harder. Try the Skyscanner app (free from the Apple App Store) to find the cheapest deal for flights on the day/time you want to travel — it scans every airline option; Airbnb for cheap accommodation in the UK and abroad; Splitwise, which, once a group such as a book club or school PTA is signed up, keeps a tally of any money due or owed.  Individuals can settle bills by PayPal. FIX ANYTHING VIA YOUTUBE: Video-sharing website YouTube is brilliant for practical advice on just about anything.  Just type in ‘How do I fix my dishwasher?’ or ‘How do I change my smoke alarm battery?’ and someone will most likely have filmed and uploaded a step-by-step guide. BECOME MORE ORGANISED: The Trello app (free from the Apple App Store) organises all your projects into ‘boards’ in one place on your phone.  In one glance, Trello shows you what’s being done and who’s doing what and when, helping you juggle work, family and social diaries. SUPERMARKET IN YOUR POCKET: Use your favourite supermarket’s app, rather than its website, to do your weekly shop.  They’re updated more often to make them more userfriendly for customers. It should remember your favourites, so that you don’t have to re-select each time, and will also start to predict your behaviour. It also automatically collects loyalty points, so saves you money in the long run. FIND YOUR PHONE HASSLE-FREE: If you misplace your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch or any Apple computer, the Find My iPhone app will let you use any Apple iOS device to find it.  At the click of the button, the app will make the lost phone play a loud sound for two minutes. You can also remotely lock the device to protect your data. NEVER FORGET A PASSWORD: The website LastPass (lastpass.com) keeps all of your accounts safe and remembers your passwords for you. You just need to remember one secure password to log in to LastPass, ‘I also use Citymapper, which tells you the best bus and rail links to get in major cities. As a trainer, I have meetings every day, so I have to be on the ball with transport.’ I’m impressed by the way Lucy respectfully quizzes Kate about her working day. It turns out that, after rising at 6am, Kate takes calls on her mobile from agency offices around the world, walks the dog, takes her son to school, has a breakfast meeting, then walks to the office. Most days, her schedule is crammed with meetings with major clients (such as Asda, HSBC, Procter & Gamble and Visa) and doing ‘creative reviews’ with colleagues globally. Kate says, these days, her job is more about flying to meet people, rather than sitting in front of a screen, so her phone is her lifeline — but Lucy still thinks she’s not using it to maximum effect. If Kate used apps on her smartphone (which you can download from the Apple App Store), she could do everything from personal banking to booking Otto’s after-school clubs while sitting at the airport. ‘Using apps on the go allows you to be more productive and, better yet, to multi-task!’ explains Lucy. ‘You can balance doing work/life admin from any location, whether at home or during your son’s football match. ‘Becoming digital allows you to work remotely. You can be at home more and plan more around your family’s schedule. It’s all about prioritising and freeing up your time. Tech allows you to spend less time doing admin, and more time doing the things you love through simple, quick transactions.’ The problem, Kate admits, is that tech doesn’t always feel like fun to women of her age. Even social media feels like a chore, especially if you hate posting every detail of your personal life to followers. ‘It feels too much like self-promotion,’ she says. Kate has a minimal Twitter presence, recently had to delete an imposter Instagram account (when someone pretended to be her) and often feels guilty about neglecting Facebook. ‘I’m on the site just to be aware of what my friends are doing and where they are in the world,’ she says. ‘It keeps you connected. But if I became more active, I’ll just let people down by missing something.’ Gently, Lucy explains why Kate needs to engage more with social media. She finds Twitter a great tool for networking. ‘You never know who you’ll be collaborating with in the future.’ While it’s estimated that, by 2020, millennials will represent half the global workforce (so we can’t ignore them!), we also need to value our own skills. Age and experience still count, Kate stresses. If you’re older, you know the shortcuts that can save days of research. She cites a report published by the Future Laboratory in 2014, which found that ‘silver entrepreneurs’ are behind Britain’s self-employment boom — businesses founded by over-50s had a 70 per cent chance of lasting five years, compared with 28 per cent for younger entrepreneurs. Kate’s own mother did a master’s degree at 45 after the kids had grown up, she adds. Session over, Kate is keen to meet Lucy again. Despite a madly busy diary, she can see the value of listening to a new voice: millennials are flexible, open-minded and love feedback. They talk about themselves as ‘a brand’, invent their own job titles and never eat lunch alone (why miss out on a chance for some informal networking?). But twentysomethings so competent can make baby-boomers feel redundant. ‘Sitting with 20-year-olds, I constantly think: “Am I remotely relevant to the conversation I am having with you right now?”,’ admits Kate. ‘You constantly question what value you add. But I’m always of the opinion, just keep being curious. It’s OK to make a total twit of yourself!’ And, as she dashes off to two more meetings, Lucy catches the bus back to her West London houseshare.

"Following" : "Follow"}} November 13, 2016 3:15pm   Comments Share: Related BAC Investors Have Cast Their Ballots For Big Bank Stocks Technical Alert: Bank Of America At Eight Year High Tracking John Paulson's Paulson & Company Portfolio - Q3 2016 Update (Seeking Alpha) Related FB RBC's Mark Mahaney Talks FANG Trade And Other Tech Stocks 3 Worries For Facebook: Fake News, Ads And Analytics Black Friday, Apple, Sina, Weibo In Focus For Investing Action Plan (Investor's Business Daily) The S&P 500 has been surprisingly stable following the shocking election of Donald Trump on Tuesday. Despite the overall stability, Trump’s election has certainly had an impact on a number of traders. International stocks, hospital stocks, gun stocks and gold stocks have been hammered. Prison stocks, drug stocks and bank stocks have soared. PreMarket Prep hosts Joel Elconin and Dennis Dick discussed the ways the Trump election has impacted traders on Friday morning’s show. Dick started out by talking about the difficulties statistical arbitrage traders have had this week. “If you are doing stat/arb here in the last couple of days, you are getting run over. I have backed off on a lot of different stat/arb strategies because I realize they aren’t working right now in this Trump market,” Dick said. Statistical arbitrage isn't the only popular strategy that is falling flat. “I do a lot of mean reversion as well. That is not working either because these trends are very, very pesky,” Dick added. He noted that his short on Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC), which spiked from $17 to $19 in two sessions this week, isn’t even working. Sturm Ruger & Company Inc (NYSE: RGR) is another mean reversion trade that has killed traders this week. After the stock plummeted 14.4 percent Wednesday, it dropped another 12 percent on Thursday and has barely bounced so far in early Friday trading. Dick mentioned Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) and Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG) as two other mean regression trades that haven’t worked in the Trump market. “When it’s straight down on the move like that, it’s tough to make money as a trader,” he concluded. Elconin said that the best thing traders can do when one strategy isn’t working in the market is switch things up. “When something’s not working, try and cut bait,” Elconin advised. “Also try and look at some new strategies… Eventually things are going to calm down.” You can hear the entire discussion starting at 2:13 in the clip below.

It will take them some time to get over that; and some considerable time to figure out how they can fight back, as members of a party that doesn’t control either the executive or legislative branches of government – and are looking warily at what might happen to the judicial branch. It's a tough pill to swallow. But, at least in Hamilton County, Democrats have one beacon of light. They now live in a county that is pretty darned blue. Tuesday's election results made it clear. We always scratch our heads when we see writers in national publications or talking heads on the cable news networks talk about Hamilton County being a "Republican stronghold." Are they confusing us with Hamilton County, Tennessee? This county has been changing slowly but steadily from red to purple to blue for the last several decades. The last time a Republican presidential candidate won Hamilton County was in 2004, when President George W. Bush came out on top. Since then, the county has lost about 40,000 people and we're guessing that many of them were urban and suburban Republicans who ended up moving to places like Butler and Warren counties, or Northern Kentucky, or who retired and took up residence in sunny climes such as Florida or Arizona. At any rate, they’re gone. And they took their GOP votes with them. The transformation to a blue county is pretty much complete. Consider: -        While she was losing Ohio as a whole, Clinton won Hamilton County Tuesday night with 52.5 percent of the unofficial vote – marking the third presidential election in a row where the Democratic presidential candidate has won the county. -        Democrat Denise Driehaus' win over Republican incumbent Dennis Deters in a race for Hamilton County commissioner – combined with Democratic incumbent Todd Portune's easy re-election victory Tuesday – gives the Democrats a majority on the three-member county commission for only the second time in over 40 years. -        Counting Driehaus and Portune, Democrats won five of eight contested races for county offices – Aftab Pureval for clerk of courts, Jim Neil re-elected sheriff, and Lakshmi Sammarco re-elected coroner. The only losses among the county offices for the Democrats were county prosecutor, where incumbent Republican Joe Deters was re-elected; county treasurer, where Robert Goering won re-election; and county recorder, where Democratic incumbent Wayne Coates was ousted by former judge Norbet Nadel. And this is probably the most amazing thing of all: On Tuesday night, Hamilton County Democrats beat candidates named Deters and Winkler. Various members of the Winkler family have been winning judicial offices for nearly 50 years. But Tuesday night, a 34-year-old political newcomer named Aftab Pureval came along and knocked off Tracy Winkler, the clerk of courts, whose campaign ran into a buzz saw when City Beat obtained and published e-mails from her chief bailiff pushing employees of the office to get involved in the re-election campaign. Some employees felt threatened by the e-mails. At any rate, it became a great campaign issue for Pureval, a lawyer for Procter & Gamble whose parents are immigrants from India and Tibet. And he struck gold again with campaign TV ads featuring the candidate and a duck puppet that would pop up now and then to squawk "Aftab!" Just like the duck in the Aflac commercials. A great way to sell an unfamiliar name; and it worked. And then there was Driehaus beating Dennis Deters, the youngest brother of the county prosecutor. Deters got into the race rather late; he was appointed in December after incumbent Republican Greg Hartmann suddenly quit the county commission. By that time, Driehaus, a term-limited state representative, already had plenty of money in the bank and she ended up outspending her opponent. We asked Hamilton County Republican Party chairman Alex Triantafilou if Hamilton County was now a blue county. He was very frank in his response. "Yes,'' he said. "When I saw the numbers coming in Tuesday, there was no doubt. I've known it was headed in this direction since I became chairman eight years ago." As far as the presidential campaign is concerned, Triantafilou said the Trump campaign simply didn't have a grassroots ground game in Hamilton County that could match Clinton. That, Triantafilous said, is why four years ago, Mitt Romney – while losing Hamilton County to Barack Obama – had 193,000 votes in Hamilton County compared to about just under 170,000 for Trump on Tuesday. "Joe Deters led the Republican ticket in Hamilton County and he ended up with about 35,000 more votes than Donald Trump did,'' Triantafilou said. Actually, in Tuesday's unofficial results, the difference between Joe Deters and Trump was 36,485. Even Dennis Deters, who lost his race for county commission, had 19,150 more votes than Trump in Hamilton County. "Trump was never going to win this county,'' Triantafilou said. "Hillary had the ground game going. "Our people turned out,'' the county GOP chairman said. "There just wasn't enough of them." It was not, however, a complete disaster, Triantafilou said. Obviously, Trump won Ohio; and U.S. Senator Rob Portman of Terrace Park coasted to re-election. The GOP, he said, will do some soul-searching after this election – not to mention some candidate-searching. There are elections for Cincinnati mayor and Cincinnati council next year, as well as nearly every suburban community in the county. "We're going to evaluate where our votes were and then try to find great candidates to run,'' Triantafilou said. Triantafilou said the Hamilton County Republican Party has plenty of young, up-and-coming potential stars out in the suburban communities, "but they're not getting much attention. The media focuses on Cincinnati races." Hamilton County Democratic Party chairman Tim Burke said it is "obvious the county is getting bluer all the time." "There are some people moving back into the city now who are not necessarily Democrats, but we still dominate the city's politics,'' Burke said. The election of Trump, Burke said, left a lot of Democrats either angry, depressed or both. But, he said, "in Hamilton County, we have a lot to celebrate too."   Tags:  Hamilton County Democratic Party General Election 2016 Hamilton County 2016 presidential election Howard Wilkinson Politics TweetShareGoogle+Email View the discussion thread. © 2016 WVXU Cincinnati Public Radio Program Schedule Our Community Calendar Contact Us WVXU's Democracy and Me for Educators Privacy Policy and Terms of Use

Skip to content Military Technologies pr @ satprnews.com Diamond Packaging Wins Three Awards in 73rd Annual Paperboard Packaging Competition Diamond Packaging Wins Three Awards in 73rd Annual Paperboard Packaging Competition Awards showcase Diamond’s folding carton decorating capabilities, including printing, cold foiling, and embossing. Rochester, NY, November 12, 2016 –(PR.com)– Diamond Packaging won three awards in the 73rd annual North American Paperboard Packaging Competition, the industry’s premier showcase for all that is new and outstanding in paperboard packaging design and technology. Awards were presented October 27, 2016 at the PPC 2016 Fall Meeting and Leadership Conference in San Antonio, TX. The competition, sponsored by the Paperboard Packaging Council (PPC) and judged by a jury of packaging professionals, industry experts, and professors, is a celebration of the industry and its creative potential. It is also an affirmation of paperboard as the clear and intelligent choice for packaging in today’s eco-conscious world. Diamond won an Excellence Award for Elizabeth Arden’s John Varvatos Artisan Blu folding carton. The carton was converted utilizing Clearwater Paper Candesce® SBS paperboard and offset printed with four color process and blue inks, in-line with UV matte, and UV gloss spot coating. The multi-level embossed “water” pattern on the front, side, and rear panels, was tightly registered to the printing and coatings, contributing to the natural aesthetic of the carton. The interplay between the coatings and multi-level embossing create a shimmering effect, inspired by Mediterranean beaches. The embossed graphic on the rear panel represents the flask-like fragrance bottle housed in handwoven rattan. Diamond won an Excellence Award for L’Oreal USA’s Matrix Oil Wonders promotional packaging. The carton was converted utilizing KapStone Kraftpak® high-yield, low density paperboard and printed with UV flexo white, opaque white, four color process, and dense black inks, in-line with UV varnish. Printed opaque white dots provide a perfect counterpoint to the brilliant gold foil stamped dots, creating dimension and visual interest. Gold foil surrounds the die cut windows, framing the hair care products within and drawing attention to the free product sample inside. Kraftpak’s natural aesthetic embodies the essence of ancient world rituals, while the gold metallic flourishes infuses the visual with a rich, exotic quality. Diamond won an Excellence Award for its 2016 calendar, which marks the 25th anniversary of a long-standing company tradition. The grandfather clock theme, with its inner mechanisms perfectly balanced, represents the collaborative and precise nature of Diamond’s work. The calendar was converted utilizing Clearwater Paper Candesce® SBS paperboard and offset printed with four color process inks, UV matte coating, and UV gloss spot coating. The dimensional header features a multi-level embossed and debossed woodgrain pattern, and a striking clock face insert enhanced with UV gloss spot coating, cold foil, and multi-level embossing, creating a dramatic sense of texture and depth. It also incorporates an opening APET rigid window panel and foil embossed chimes that artfully simulate a real grandfather clock. The middle backers also feature a multi-level embossed woodgrain pattern, and three unique sets of foil embossed gears enhanced with UV gloss spot coating. Metal Magic provided all of the embossing dies. The tightly-registered foil accents, which lend authenticity to the piece, were achieved using state-of-the-art, in-line cold foiling technology. They also showcase the type of decorative effects that can cost-effectively elevate customers’ brands. All of Diamond’s winning entries were manufactured using 100% clean, renewable wind energy and produced in a Zero Manufacturing Waste to Landfill (ZMWL) facility.
