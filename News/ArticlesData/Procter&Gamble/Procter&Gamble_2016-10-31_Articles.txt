By John Kiesewetter • Nov 1, 2016 TweetShareGoogle+Email Credit Procter & Gamble / Provided Cincinnati's Procter & Gamble might not be the nation's No. 1 advertiser if AT&T merges with cable giant Time Warner. The New York Post reports that "if AT&T survives regulatory scrutiny without having to divest too many assets, the new AT&T will become the nation’s No. 1 advertiser — leaping past Procter & Gamble, the maker of toilet paper, toothpaste and laundry detergent. The mega-merger is expected to take a year to close." P&G spends $4.3 billion in advertising, the paper says. At 2015 spending levels, the new AT&T/Time Warner together would devote $5.6 billion to advertising, when when you combine AT&T's $3.9 billion and Time Warner's $1.7 billion. AT&T also "would become the biggest media owner, leaping over Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, but would sit behind Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook in terms of market capitalization," the paper said. AT&T's new DirecTV Now, an online offering of 100 channels, will be launched Friday, the paper said.

Taylor, diretor-presidente da Procter & Gamble, diz que a empresa precisa ser mais eficiente nas suas atividades fundamentais, como a venda em massa no varejo e o marketing de seus produtos. Photo: Business Wire Por Sharon Terlep, de Cincinnati Sharon Terlep The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiografiaSharon Terlep @sharonterlep Terça-Feira, 1 de Novembro de 2016 00:04 EDT O rápido crescimento da empresa americana Dollar Shave Club, que envia pelo correio aparelhos de barbear e uma variedade de itens de cuidados pessoais diretamente ao consumidor e também oferece outros serviços on-line, surpreendeu alguns executivos da Procter & Gamble Co. e deixou atordoada uma indústria que via o domínio da linha Gilette, da P&G, como inabalável. Mas o diretor-presidente da P&G, David Taylor, continua tranquilo. Há um ano no comando da maior empresa de itens de consumo do mundo, o executivo americano de 58 anos ressalta que a participação da Dollar Shave Club está “estagnando” e que o mercado da “startups” é “muito segmentado”. “Se você tem produtos com desempenho superior e divulga bem isso”, disse ele ao The Wall Street Journal, “você tende a vencer com o passar do tempo”. Num momento em que mudanças nos hábitos de consumo revolucionam o modo como as pessoas fazem compras e muitos dos gigantes corporativos buscam se reinventar, Taylor evita falar de reinvenção. Ele tem como meta manter a P&G na liderança ao reforçar os pontos fortes tradicionais da firma americana. ENLARGE Há 36 anos na P&G, Taylor não demonstrou interesse em adquirir uma startup famosa. Também não lançou novas marcas grandes ou fez planos para uma mudança sísmica na forma de distribuir itens domésticos básicos ao consumidor. Para alguns em Wall Street, a estratégia soa arrogante. A fabricante das fraldas Pampers e do detergente líquido para roupas Ariel vem registrando anos de crescimento anêmico e perda de participação de mercado. “O mundo inteiro ao redor dele está mudando, mas eles querem continuar fazendo” o mesmo de sempre, diz o analista Ali Dibadj, da firma financeira americana Bernstein Research. Segundo Dibadj, vai chegar um ponto em que a empresa terá de enfrentar isso. “Parece que a arrogância da P&G está de volta.” Com fala mansa, Taylor parece o oposto do arrogante. Ex-gerente de fábrica, ele migrou para a área de gestão de marca e escalou a hierarquia da P&G. Em seu escritório na sede da P&G, em Cincinnati, no Estado de Ohio, Taylor disse estar confiante de que as melhores perspectivas da P&G continuam ligadas aos fundamentos da empresa. Isso significa vender para as massas por meio de grandes varejistas com base em pesquisas meticulosas sobre o consumidor, uma operação gigantesca de pesquisa e desenvolvimento e o maior orçamento de publicidade do mundo. A P&G, diz ele, precisa aprender a fazer essas coisas mais rapidamente e de forma mais eficaz. “Nós sempre respeitamos nossos concorrentes e vamos aprender”, disse ele. “Há vezes em que temos de nos concentrar em valor e vezes em que temos de nos concentrar no desempenho.” Questionado sobre a aquisição recente da Dollar Shave Club pela rival europeia Unilever PLC, um negócio de US$ 1 bilhão anunciado pela empresa rival como uma forma de coletar dados do consumidor, Taylor destaca que a P&G já possui um banco valioso de dados e ideias. A participação de mercado da Gillette caiu 10% desde a chegada da Dollar Shave Club, apesar de a marca ainda deter quase 60% do mercado de lâminas masculinas de barbear nos Estados Unidos. Em uma conferência de resultados recente, o diretor financeiro da P&G, Jon Moeller, respondeu a uma pergunta sobre vendas diretas ao consumidor ressaltando que o setor é pequeno. “Quantas pessoas você realmente conhece que querem satisfazer as necessidades de compras da família tendo que ir a 40 sites de varejo para 40 produtos diferentes?” A P&G já teve experiências com venda direta antes, como o serviço por assinatura para o seu produto Tide Pods, mas não investiu em nenhuma iniciativa mais ampla nesse sentido. No seu primeiro ano como diretor-presidente, Taylor duplicou os cortes de custos, anunciando, em fevereiro, um plano para reduzir US$ 10 bilhões adicionais ao longo dos próximos quatro anos. A empresa eliminou mais de 20 mil postos de trabalho desde 2012 e faturou mais de US$ 20 bilhões ao se desfazer de marcas como Duracell e CoverGirl. Muitas das novas economias virão de reestruturações nas cadeias de suprimento na América do Norte e na Europa. A P&G está concentrando forças em seus dois maiores mercados, a China e a América do Norte. Mas ela busca cortar custos e se tornar mais eficiente globalmente. Na América Latina, onde a instabilidade política contribuiu para vários resultados trimestrais fracos, a companhia começou recentemente a reorganizar a fabricação de uma série de produtos na tentativa de ampliar a flexibilidade das operações de manufatura. A P&G tem perdido participação de mercado na China, o que Taylor descreveu como um resultado “inaceitável” da tentativa fracassada da empresa de se manter à frente das marcas locais. Ele admite que a P&G teve seus tropeços. Ela continuou se expandindo durante a recessão e se tornou muito dispersa, diz ele. Depois, cortou investimentos em pesquisa e desenvolvimento e na construção de marca e tentou reverter o crescimento lento aumentando os preços, mas perdeu mercado. “Nós perdemos o equilíbrio e estamos tentando retomá-lo”, diz ele. Um ponto-chave para voltar aos trilhos, segundo ele, é eliminar níveis de burocracia que tornam mais lento o processo de criação de novos produtos. Os executivos dizem que estão vendo resultados. Um exemplo é o sabão para lavar roupas Tide Purclean, não prejudicial ao meio ambiente. Ele foi concebido e chegou ao mercado em nove meses. Um novo produto costumava levar entre dois e três anos para ser desenvolvido na P&G. Fundamental para acelerar o processo foi um novo método em que líderes de diferentes áreas trabalharam simultaneamente. Então, em vez de concluir o desenvolvimento químico do produto e depois deixar o trabalho com a equipe que desenvolve a embalagem, essas etapas foram desenvolvidas conjuntamente. Lori Hudson, gestora de portfólio da consultoria americana de investimentos Bahl & Gaynor, que já teve ações da P&G, gosta do fato de Taylor ter reconhecido os equívocos na China, já que a P&G “nunca pareceu ser o tipo de empresa que admite erros”. Mas Taylor “é uma pessoa que passou a vida na P&G e isso pode ser bom ou ruim, porque as coisas mudaram muito em termos do que o consumidor quer”, diz Hudson. “Ele é um visionário? Não sei.” Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Tamanho da fonte Regular Médio Grande Google+ Imprimir Wall Street Journal Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ YouTube Podcasts GooglePlay AppStore Assinar /Acessar Voltar ao alto« Subscribe Why Subscribe?

Jamal Carnette (TMFJCar) Oct 31, 2016 at 11:59AM Looking for cold hard cash? These five companies are paying big dividends. Image source: Getty Images. It's a poorly kept secret that dividends are a large driver of stock market returns. Over the past 25 years, the S&P 500 index has provided investors with a nearly 450% return. However, if investors would have reinvested dividends, their pre-tax return would be approximately 80% higher at 810%. With that in mind, we asked a few Motley Fool contributors their favorite dividend stocks to buy in November. This dividend is as solid as steel Neha Chamaria: One dividend stock that's caught my attention this month is Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE). The steelmaker's recently released third-quarter numbers didn't go down well with the market, as the company missed analyst estimates, but Nucor delivered a solid quarter in reality, with its net income for the first nine months of the year climbing 30% year over year. With that kind of growth in profits, shareholders can safely expect Nucor to dole out higher dividends going forward. In fact, Nucor isn't any other dividend stock. It's a dividend aristocrat that has increased its dividend for 43 straight years and has paid out a dividend for 174 consecutive quarters now. No other company in its industry boasts such an incredible dividend record. Moreover, Nucor wouldn't be maintaining such a streak given the cyclicality of steel business if it weren't financially strong and stable. In fact, Nucor's balance sheet is among the strongest in the industry, with limited debt and ample liquid cash. What's more, the steelmaker generated twice as much free cash flow as net income during the trailing 12 months, which is incredible, as a company pays dividends out of its FCF. So there's every chance Nucor will be able to maintain its streak of dividend increases in the coming years. With Nucor offering a juicy dividend yield of 3.2%, income investors should consider the stock's 13% drop in the past three months an opportunity not to be missed. Microsoft is executing on all levels Evan Niu, CFA: This might sound a little odd given my obvious bias here, but I'm going to go with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The software giant has been firing on all cylinders lately, and much of that is largely thanks to CEO Satya Nadella. For years, investors lacked optimism around the company's future direction, but Nadella genuinely has them excited again, as he has a much clearer strategic vision than his predecessor, Steve Ballmer. We're now seeing Microsoft innovate in hardware in a way that we've quite literally never seen before. At the same time, the core enterprise business is as strong as ever, with Office continuing to crush it on both the consumer and commercial fronts. Microsoft's new Surface Studio shows the company is fully committed to hardware success. Image source: Microsoft. As far as the numbers go, Microsoft's yield is fairly modest at this point. Shares yield approximately 2.5% at current prices, but this yield is being pushed down, since Microsoft is at all-time highs. Shares are now even higher than they were during the 2000 tech bubble. But the big difference between then and now is that the valuation is much more compelling, and cash flow far more sustainable. Sure, there are higher yields out there, even within tech, but I think Microsoft currently presents a compelling combination of reliable income combined with reasonable potential for capital appreciation as long as the company continues to execute under Nadella's leadership. Procter & Gamble may be a boring stock, but it has provided investors exciting returns Jamal Carnette, CFA: The dividend trade has become quite crowded because of historically low interest rates on bonds and other interest-bearing investments. The key is to find a well-run company committed to paying and raising their dividend, and not simply companies that have raised their dividends to take advantage of current investor sentiment. One dividend aristocrat with an amazing dividend history is Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). The consumer-goods company has paid dividends for 126 consecutive years and has increased its dividend for 60 years straight. In the past 30 years, P&G has kicked its rate of dividend increases into high gear by increasing its per-share payout by 9.8% per year through fiscal 2016, a rate much higher than overall inflation during this timeframe. Currently the company trades at a yield of 3.2%, 70 basis points higher than a current 30-year U.S. Treasury bond. There's a belief among many investors that a "boring" company like P&G will disappoint as valuations are currently stretched among dividend-paying stocks. Additionally, the company's core products (Tide, Pampers, and Charmin) are in the uninspiring fast-moving-consumer-goods space. However, the company has averaged an annual total return of 7.8% over the last 15 years, a full percentage point better than the greater S&P during this period. On a one-year basis, P&G has doubled the index by increasing 12.7%, versus 6%. Still, the company trades at a lower price-to-earnings valuation than the overall S&P index. Shares recently popped on a positive first-quarter report in which the company beat both EPS and revenue estimates while maintaining full-year sales guidance. Procter & Gamble may be considered boring, but its stable of billion-dollar brands should allow the company to continue to pay and raise dividend payments to investors for years to come. Things are looking up for this large-cap drugmaker George Budwell: Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) is arguably one of most compelling Big Pharma to stocks to own right now because of Keytruda's recent approval as a treatment for front-line metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The bottom line is that this single indication has the potential to add around $2.5 billion to Keytruda's annual sales at peak. Moreover, industry experts believe that oncologists will quickly adopt Keytruda as a first-line NSCLC treatment, especially after its main rival, Opdivo, flamed out in late-stage testing for this same indication.   Image source: Merck. That's certainly welcome news for shareholders, especially since Merck's 12-month trailing payout ratio currently stands at a worrisome 100.55%. In other words, Merck's slightly above-average yield for a major drugmaker of approximately 3% should now be safe. Perhaps most importantly, though, Keytruda's breakthrough for this high-value indication should act as a magnet for large institutional investors moving forward, helping to drive its share price higher. Wall Street, after all, places a high premium on franchise-level cancer drugs, and Keytruda is undoubtedly on its way toward becoming a top-selling oncology product in the near future.   Growth and yield? Sign me up Brian Feroldi: It's rare to find a company that offers up a yield of nearly 4.5% that's also poised for long-term growth, but that's exact what Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE:BIP) offers investors today. This company is a publicly traded limited partnership that owns and operates infrastructure assets all around the world. Currently, the company owns electrical transmission lines, ports, toll roads, pipelines, rail lines, and more. What do all of these assets have in common? They are all one of a kind, are irreplaceable, and require huge amounts of capital to build. That means the company doesn't really have to worry about having a competitor set up shop right next door, which helps make its financial statements highly predictable. In fact, over 90% of its revenue either comes from regulated industries or operates under long-term contracts. Brookfield's stability allows its management team to pass along an ever-growing stream of profits back to investors. Since 2009, the company's distribution has grown by 12% annually, and there are plenty of reasons to expect another payout bump next year. While there are potential tax ramifications that need to be considered before buying shares, I think this is a great stock for income-focused investors to consider buying today.

Even when great ideas come up from the lowest of the hierarchical ladder, it is rarely delivered to the very top. The leadership shouts for innovation, but it often does not realize that innovation is within arm's reach. Letting ideas flow freely within an organization ― the open innovation platform ― is a critical factor in driving creative success for a company. "It's not okay from the CEO's perspective to say to that bright young person you just hired, 'if you have an idea, you have to sell the idea to your boss, your boss' boss and your boss' boss' boss before it has a chance of being implemented,'" said Tom Kelley, partner at IDEO, the world's first and largest design thinking consultancy which started off in Palo Alto, California. "Some people you hire for their deep technical excellence, but they don't always have the communication skills to sell the idea to the hierarchy. As an outsider, I don't want to shake up the hierarchy, I want to go to the CEO and say 'Look, you've earned the right to be the boss, to make the hiring decisions, but don't let the hierarchy get in the way of the free flow of ideas,'" he said during an interview with The Korea Times. Kelley was in Seoul to give a speech at Startup:CON (Oct. 11-12), a conference for startups and innovators, organized by the Korea Creative Content Agency (KOCCA). "In all such cultures, you've got to find a way to have that idea float, go up and down the hierarchy, through an open innovation platform inside the company -- whether it be poster-days or internal trade fairs ― or some way that systematically floats ideas up and down. You have to have a way," he said. Tom Kelley speaks during an interview with The Korea Times. / Courtesy of Startup:CON Barriers to innovation The hierarchical structure isn't just confined to Asia. The problem is not much different in the United States, he said. There are always barriers within any organization in the world and so there's a need to get through it, Kelley added. "Especially in hierarchical cultures you need to find some way to cut through the hierarchy with respect to ideas. My experience is, you have the support at the very top. I've never met a CEO who is not pro-innovation. So the support is there. It's just in some organizations, there's the energy at the top among visionaries and there's the energy among young new members of the team who want to change the world ― it only gets stuck in the middle." Cultural barriers to innovation are also not confined to a hierarchical system. In large established companies, there's "always the need to get today's work out perfectly," says Kelley. "Sometimes they don't have the time or attention to think of tomorrow. If you're too focused on getting today's work done ― the only job in front of you ― that's a barrier." Design thinking This is where design thinking comes in. Design thinking is a cognitive methodology and activity that helps people to develop creative ways to solve issues. Kelley puts it as "using the tool set or mindset of a designer ― such as designing objects or architecture ― and taking that same process and applying it to bigger issues such as designing a school system, designing new ways to interact with health services or rural villages to get better access to clean water." Simply put, it is "using the tool set or mindset of a designer for broader topics." Kelly says the three key tools for design thinking are empathy, experimentation and storytelling. "If you're a tech company, you need to blend technology with humanity. You need to bring your strengths to the table. Then the heart of the experiment must be that we're the kind of team that tries stuff. We will fail but we will still try stuff. You need to prototype. Finally, even with the best idea in the world, if you can't get other people to adopt it, it's not going to change anything. You need to take that concept and wrap it in a good story." IDEO, which his brother David Kelley founded and Tom Kelley is a partner at, is a company that has pioneered in design thinking for the past 30 years, creating human-centered products, services and spaces, and helping organizations innovate by empowering the people who drive them. Changing the culture What they have seen from the example of P&G, their most memorable client which saw success from applying design thinking to their company, was that the role of a middle manager or those with significant authority who were able to "pick up the ball" was crucial in initiating creative projects. "We collectively changed the culture of P&G during that era. It included support from the top, but that's not enough. Claudia (Kotchka), a leader with a big personality, a lot of stamina, and with permission from the CEO, systematically drove design thinking within P&G. She was vice president for design innovation and strategy and had the respect which went with her high position but she didn't have direct authority with anyone she worked with. She had to convince them using the power of her arguments over the power of authority," Kelley said. "The same thing happened with Kaaren (Hanson), vice president of design innovation at Intuit. Top support was not enough. The executives said they'll do it but didn't come back and went on with their daily jobs. Nothing happened. So she picked up the ball. She created a program called Catalyst with nine people. They needed a series of successes. You need to point to a success or two for the skeptics. If you get to the successes, then you have entry proof to say 'Here's a situation where design thinking won the day,' as soon as people see that, they'll say 'yes I want some.'" Kelley says the P&G model is replicable. "Anybody with the right support and right energy can do that," he said. "It really changed P&G ― we saw it in their stock price, product introduction, and passion of individuals. They designed hands on experiences with design thinking, and realized this stuff actually worked. It wasn't persuading them but demonstrating for them. It was a different lens to look at their business. Even among the skeptics, when the early successes come out, they'd say, 'I want some of that. Get that for my division.'" However, success is not always measured as a number, he says. "A clear understanding of what success looks or feels like can be useful. There's not an obvious metric." Creative confidence Kelley, author of "Creative Confidence" and "The Art of Innovation," was nowhere near the artistic world. He was working in the finance, IT and consulting fields, before joining IDEO to work with his brother. He says working with creative people has transformed him. "You have to be vulnerable enough to be willing to try something you won't necessarily be good at right away and then you've got to be humble to realize how much you can learn," said Kelley. "To be honest, at some point in the early history of IDEO, we had some (employees with) MBAs from very prestigious schools who came in and thought they already knew what they needed to know and had trouble being team players with designers, engineers and anthropologists. We need to take the opposite approach. If you want to achieve creative confidence, you have to first acknowledge that you have something to learn." Being open to possibilities is the step to gaining creative confidence, he said. Newspaper innovation How can design thinking be applied to newspapers? "It's quite a challenge. It's an extremely challenging environment. It's not that a worthy competitor has stolen a bit of market share from us that we could steal back. It's not one core aspect of our business that is demonetized. It's hard to compete against free," he said. "I want to pay for news because I want journalism. Not somebody's opinion. I want somebody who's verified their facts. That is not free and somebody has to pay for it. I'm willing to pay my fair share of that." The newspaper industry has to figure out a way to innovate itself, said Kelley. "How might we sustain really good journalism through the next few decades? Very possibly the answer is not in print form." To view the video clip of the interview, click on the link below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERPDWkuabzM&t=18s ysy@ktimes.com 1.

New, 2 comments Is this a questionable partnership? by simeonmoses Oct 31, 2016, 5:00pm PDT tweet share pin Rec Amway is getting involved in NCAA sports Justin Ford-USA TODAY Sports The former USA Today Coaches poll is now being referred to as the “Amway Coaches Poll.” An undisclosed sum was paid for the naming rights in conjunction with the American Football Coaches Association and USA Today Sports Media group. Amway will also have naming rights to a new fan based poll and “The Symbol of Supremacy in College Football™, the AFCA Coaches’ Trophy.” So what's the big deal you ask? Lots of companies are involved in the naming rights of sports organizations so why is Amway's entrance into the college football world any different? Let's dive in to what Amway is, their history and why the naming rights to the Coaches Poll could be of some concern. Amway is what is referred as a Multi-Level Marketing firm. The FTC sued Amway back in 1979 alleging it was a pyramid scheme but Amway settled for a fine when a judged ruled they were not an illegal pyramid scheme but did engage in price fixing and illegal marketing practices by inflating the average distributor profits reported. In 1986 they were fined again for illegal marketing practices. Most recently Amway settled a lawsuit alleging illegal business practices for $56 million dollars in which the plaintiffs accused Amway of running an illegal pyramid scheme. They have also been sued by the RIAA for $9 million for illegal use of music and in a stranger lawsuit, Procter and Gamble won a $19.25 million lawsuit against Amway when some affiliated “IBOs” accused P&G CEO of being a satanist and using a satanic trademark. Regardless of one's views on multi-level marketing it is apparent that Amway has run into consistent legal issues due to their business practices. According to Amway's own brochure (2012) fine print only .32% of their IBO participants achieved a median income of $55,042 to achieve their elite Q12 status. That means over 99% of participants were making less than the U.S. median wage. Such a low success rate they legally were obligated to disclose is not a business opportunity that is appropriate for most individuals, in particular low-income college students who can not reasonably afford the investment risk to get started. Back in 2004 when Amway was doing business as Quixtar, Chris Hansen with Dateline NBC did a hidden camera expose of the tactics used to lure in new participants. The shady tactics used by Quixtar are the same tactics that Amway uses today (Quixtar brand was “retired” in 2008). Amway is also a major contributor to political campaigns. According to opensecrets.org Amway ranked 54th (as of this writing) of over 17,000 companies who have donated to candidates and PACs with over 4.3 million dollars donated this election cycle. This is part of their overall strategy to keep their version of multi-level marketing legal. This has become a more pressing issue for Amway as a similar company, Herbalife, continues to face scrutiny from the FTC that Herbalife is operating as a pyramid scheme. This was recently highlighted in a Slate article how the Direct Selling Association, of which Amway is a major part of, is using political muscle to influence legislation in their favor to continue business practices many still find questionable. So what does all this have to do with the Amway Coaches Poll? Speaking with expert, Robert Fitzpatrick, who has been an expert witness in legal cases against MLM companies, Amway may be looking to gain more influence over potential targeted demographics of the company. Buying the naming rights to the Coaches poll gets the brand Amway more publicly known and helps legitimize their business in the public's eyes through their association of the trusted American Football Coaches Association. Amway may potentially be targeting college students in their naming rights effort. According to Fitzpatrick, this would make a lot of sense for Amway to target a college-aged population. As younger generations are less aware of the Amway's legal troubles, they may look more favorably upon becoming one of Amway's “IBOs” or Independent Business Operators not having known others who have already lost money in this MLM enterprise. Amway's business model relies on the constant absorption of fresh recruits into their fold. College students deep in debt and looking for extra money may be attracted to what is pitched as a lucrative business opportunity. Unfortunately, the statistics for success for Amway distributors is extremely low. The average distributor lost $1,176 in 2010. That may not seem like a lot of money to some individuals but that is a steep sum to a college student who generally has very little incoming cash flow. Thus, vulnerable college students may find themselves deeper in debt pursuing an opportunity that is pushed on them using high pressure tactics that are well documented among past participants. If you google an impartial term like “Amway reviews” countless blogs and stories document the people feeling scammed in the wake of becoming an Amway distributor. Those associated with college athletics should take a deep look into who they are partnering with and ask some tough questions. Is Amway the kind of company the NCAA and college athletics should be associating with? Those of us on the outside looking in should also take part in this discussion. Whether a journalist, athlete or fan we all have a big stake in making sure students and athletes are not being targeted when they are most economically vulnerable by brands looking to take advantage of those vulnerabilities.

Jamal Carnette (TMFJCar) Oct 31, 2016 at 11:59AM Looking for cold hard cash? These five companies are paying big dividends. Image source: Getty Images. It's a poorly kept secret that dividends are a large driver of stock market returns. Over the past 25 years, the S&P 500 index has provided investors with a nearly 450% return. However, if investors would have reinvested dividends, their pre-tax return would be approximately 80% higher at 810%. With that in mind, we asked a few Motley Fool contributors their favorite dividend stocks to buy in November. This dividend is as solid as steel Neha Chamaria: One dividend stock that's caught my attention this month is Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE). The steelmaker's recently released third-quarter numbers didn't go down well with the market, as the company missed analyst estimates, but Nucor delivered a solid quarter in reality, with its net income for the first nine months of the year climbing 30% year over year. With that kind of growth in profits, shareholders can safely expect Nucor to dole out higher dividends going forward. In fact, Nucor isn't any other dividend stock. It's a dividend aristocrat that has increased its dividend for 43 straight years and has paid out a dividend for 174 consecutive quarters now. No other company in its industry boasts such an incredible dividend record. Moreover, Nucor wouldn't be maintaining such a streak given the cyclicality of steel business if it weren't financially strong and stable. In fact, Nucor's balance sheet is among the strongest in the industry, with limited debt and ample liquid cash. What's more, the steelmaker generated twice as much free cash flow as net income during the trailing 12 months, which is incredible, as a company pays dividends out of its FCF. So there's every chance Nucor will be able to maintain its streak of dividend increases in the coming years. With Nucor offering a juicy dividend yield of 3.2%, income investors should consider the stock's 13% drop in the past three months an opportunity not to be missed. Microsoft is executing on all levels Evan Niu, CFA: This might sound a little odd given my obvious bias here, but I'm going to go with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The software giant has been firing on all cylinders lately, and much of that is largely thanks to CEO Satya Nadella. For years, investors lacked optimism around the company's future direction, but Nadella genuinely has them excited again, as he has a much clearer strategic vision than his predecessor, Steve Ballmer. We're now seeing Microsoft innovate in hardware in a way that we've quite literally never seen before. At the same time, the core enterprise business is as strong as ever, with Office continuing to crush it on both the consumer and commercial fronts. Microsoft's new Surface Studio shows the company is fully committed to hardware success. Image source: Microsoft. As far as the numbers go, Microsoft's yield is fairly modest at this point. Shares yield approximately 2.5% at current prices, but this yield is being pushed down, since Microsoft is at all-time highs. Shares are now even higher than they were during the 2000 tech bubble. But the big difference between then and now is that the valuation is much more compelling, and cash flow far more sustainable. Sure, there are higher yields out there, even within tech, but I think Microsoft currently presents a compelling combination of reliable income combined with reasonable potential for capital appreciation as long as the company continues to execute under Nadella's leadership. Procter & Gamble may be a boring stock, but it has provided investors exciting returns Jamal Carnette, CFA: The dividend trade has become quite crowded because of historically low interest rates on bonds and other interest-bearing investments. The key is to find a well-run company committed to paying and raising their dividend, and not simply companies that have raised their dividends to take advantage of current investor sentiment. One dividend aristocrat with an amazing dividend history is Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). The consumer-goods company has paid dividends for 126 consecutive years and has increased its dividend for 60 years straight. In the past 30 years, P&G has kicked its rate of dividend increases into high gear by increasing its per-share payout by 9.8% per year through fiscal 2016, a rate much higher than overall inflation during this timeframe. Currently the company trades at a yield of 3.2%, 70 basis points higher than a current 30-year U.S. Treasury bond. There's a belief among many investors that a "boring" company like P&G will disappoint as valuations are currently stretched among dividend-paying stocks. Additionally, the company's core products (Tide, Pampers, and Charmin) are in the uninspiring fast-moving-consumer-goods space. However, the company has averaged an annual total return of 7.8% over the last 15 years, a full percentage point better than the greater S&P during this period. On a one-year basis, P&G has doubled the index by increasing 12.7%, versus 6%. Still, the company trades at a lower price-to-earnings valuation than the overall S&P index. Shares recently popped on a positive first-quarter report in which the company beat both EPS and revenue estimates while maintaining full-year sales guidance. Procter & Gamble may be considered boring, but its stable of billion-dollar brands should allow the company to continue to pay and raise dividend payments to investors for years to come. Things are looking up for this large-cap drugmaker George Budwell: Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) is arguably one of most compelling Big Pharma to stocks to own right now because of Keytruda's recent approval as a treatment for front-line metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The bottom line is that this single indication has the potential to add around $2.5 billion to Keytruda's annual sales at peak. Moreover, industry experts believe that oncologists will quickly adopt Keytruda as a first-line NSCLC treatment, especially after its main rival, Opdivo, flamed out in late-stage testing for this same indication.   Image source: Merck. That's certainly welcome news for shareholders, especially since Merck's 12-month trailing payout ratio currently stands at a worrisome 100.55%. In other words, Merck's slightly above-average yield for a major drugmaker of approximately 3% should now be safe. Perhaps most importantly, though, Keytruda's breakthrough for this high-value indication should act as a magnet for large institutional investors moving forward, helping to drive its share price higher. Wall Street, after all, places a high premium on franchise-level cancer drugs, and Keytruda is undoubtedly on its way toward becoming a top-selling oncology product in the near future.   Growth and yield? Sign me up Brian Feroldi: It's rare to find a company that offers up a yield of nearly 4.5% that's also poised for long-term growth, but that's exact what Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE:BIP) offers investors today. This company is a publicly traded limited partnership that owns and operates infrastructure assets all around the world. Currently, the company owns electrical transmission lines, ports, toll roads, pipelines, rail lines, and more. What do all of these assets have in common? They are all one of a kind, are irreplaceable, and require huge amounts of capital to build. That means the company doesn't really have to worry about having a competitor set up shop right next door, which helps make its financial statements highly predictable. In fact, over 90% of its revenue either comes from regulated industries or operates under long-term contracts. Brookfield's stability allows its management team to pass along an ever-growing stream of profits back to investors. Since 2009, the company's distribution has grown by 12% annually, and there are plenty of reasons to expect another payout bump next year. While there are potential tax ramifications that need to be considered before buying shares, I think this is a great stock for income-focused investors to consider buying today.

The combined overall revenue of selected eight MNCs during the Financial Year 16 registered a total of USD 9436.66 million, whereas the combined revenue of selected seven Indian FMCG is USD 11066.46 Million, reveals the joint study. The highest profit after tax margin of leading Indian FMCG is maintained at 25.48 percent by ITC Ltd. as comparative to Procter & Gamble Hygiene & Health Care Ltd. among selected Leading MNC players in FMCG Sector in India, which maintained the highest profit after tax margin by 17.03 percent which is comparatively lower. The study has observed performance analysis of selected Indian FMCG Companies that the ITC Ltd. is leading amongst others with its recorded 25.48 percent. After Taxes Profit Margin (PAT) during the Financial Year, 2016; as its Profit After Taxes is USD 1514.57 Million against revenue of USD 5944.79 Million. While Britannia Industries Ltd. stands second among other selected ones in terms of generated revenue by USD 1222.75 Million during the FY 2016 and has registered growth in revenue by 10.76 percent as comparative to FY2015, however its After Taxes Profit Margin (PAT) is 9.43 percent which is comparatively lower than its peers in the sector. The performance of Dabur India Ltd. is next to ITC Ltd. in terms of After Taxes Profit Margin (PAT) registered with 16.34 percent which is USD 144.54 Million against the revenue of USD 884.62 Million.In terms of After Taxes Profit Margin (PAT), the Godrej Consumer Products Ltd. is close to Dabur India Ltd. with 15.37 percent which is on the basis of USD113.80 Million of PAT against revenue of USD740.24 Million. The Marico Ltd. also performed closely with that of Godrej Consumer Products Ltd. as the percentage of PAT margin remained 14.19 percent which comes out on the basis of the disclosed figure of PAT USD107.98 Million against the USD761.14 Million of revenue. About the performance of Amul, although the company has revenue USD 743.69 Million, which is slight more than Godrej Consumer Products Ltd. but the PAT margin is least amongst others having just 0.32 percent. In case of Amul, the reason can be the fact of controlled prices and nature of milk and milk made products. The Performance of Patanjali Ayurved has been unmatched and leaves behind all its competitors in the segment with record growth of 146.31percent in the revenue on Y-o-Y basis. As the Patanjali Ayurved has achieved the revenue of USD 769.23 Million during FY 2016 against just USD 312.31 Million during FY 2015. After analyzing the performance of selected Multi-National Companies of FMCG Sector in India, the study has observed that the Hindustan Unilever Ltd. is leading with its revenue earned USD 4921.10 Million with 3.84percent Year over year ( Y-o-Y) growth in the revenue. But its PAT margin during the year is USD 628.06 Million i.e only 12.76 percent which is comparatively lower than its competitor. As data analysis shows that Procter & Gamble Hygiene and Health Care Ltd. is leading amongst others with its recorded 17.03percent After Taxes Profit Margin (PAT) during the Financial Year 2016 because its Profit After Taxes is USD 65.10 Million against revenue of USD 382.20Million. Where the performance of Glaxosmithkline Consumer Healthcare Ltd. has recorded 15.94percent PAT margin for having its After Taxes Profit of USD105.68 Million against Revenue of USD 662.88Million, the Colgate-Palmolive (India ) Ltd. achieved 13.85 percent PAT Margin with its USD 88.69Million against revenue of USD 640.35Million. Gillette India Ltd. achieved 10.19 percent PAT Margin for its just USD 32.77Million of PAT against USD 321.62 Million of revenue.

Consultancy firm R3 has released a guide to the best client-agency relationships after gathering more than 100 submissions from leading global marketers and their agencies. Called Global 40, the study whittled down these submissions to a final 40 relationships that have stood the test of time and proven themselves to be effective and mutually beneficial. Interestingly, R3 noted that the 40 relationships in its study have lasted for an average of 22 years, compared to the industry average of 3.2 years, proving that "managed pro-actively, these commitments can endure". "Great marriages require mutual trust, a common understanding and clear goals," said Greg Paull, Principal of R3. "What separates these partnerships is a sense that both sides are working to improve brand outcomes, separate to personal agendas, politics and infighting," he added. Some of the world's best-known brands are included in the rankings, including Procter & Gamble, the world's largest marketer, which has four relationships in the top 40. R3 said that Procter & Gamble invests as much internal time on training its own team on agency management as it does immersing the agencies, but it also highlighted the successful multiple relationships developed by Unilever, P&G's great rival, as well as Coca-Cola and McDonald's. Some of the other top brands featured in the report include Adidas, Apple, BMW, FedEx, IBM, Mondelez and 24 others. Based on how these brands have maintained effective partnerships with their agencies, the study also drew six important conclusions for global CMOs. "Look to new models" – R3 said all cases in its report had experimented with new ways of working, structures and outcomes. "Face time matters" – despite the rise of technology, R3 said the best partnerships find ways to regularly connect to share best practice. "Focus on outcomes, not inputs" – as with the recent agreement between McDonald's and Omnicom, both sides can align by setting mutually common objectives. "Take digital seriously" – global CMOs need a strategic digital partner rather than one just for tactical execution. "Immersion both ways" – both clients and agencies need to build understanding of each other's work and internal initiatives. Finally, "Benchmark and evaluate" – global CMOS and agencies need to share a "Dashboard of Best Practice" to drive effectiveness and efficiencies.

Associated Press   FILE - In this Aug. 17, 2016, file photo, Illinois state Comptroller Leslie Munger speaks to supporters at a rally in Springfield, Ill. Munger faces Democrat Susana Mendoza, Libertarian Claire Ball, and the Green Party's Tim Curtin in the general election. Associated Press   By SOPHIA TAREEN     CHICAGO -- Four candidates are running for Illinois comptroller, the person who controls the state's checkbook. Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner appointed business executive Leslie Munger to the post last year after the death of Judy Baar Topinka, who died shortly after winning re-election in 2014. The winner of next Tuesday's special election, coinciding with the presidential contest, will fill the remainder of the term expiring in 2019. Munger is running, along with Democrat Susana Mendoza, Libertarian Claire Ball and Green Party candidate Tim Curtin. Here's a closer look at the candidates: REPUBLICAN: Leslie Geissler Munger, 60, Lincolnshire Family: Married, two sons Education: University of Illinois, B.A.; Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, M.B.A. Occupation and experience: After making an unsuccessful bid for the Illinois House in 2014, she was appointed Illinois comptroller, her first public office. Worked as a brand management executive with Unilever Helene Curtis, for Procter and Gamble and McKinsey and Company Inc. Illinois' top issues: Debt, growing pension and Medicaid costs, and outdated technology. On prioritizing bills: "As a rule of thumb: Those suffering the greatest hardship, and our most vulnerable, should always take precedence." On term limits: "Term limits and redistricting reform are essential for ensuring more accountable government in Springfield." On the budget gridlock: "We can't just cut our way to a balanced budget - we also need new revenue. I believe that can best be achieved through expanding our tax base by making Illinois a place where employers want to locate, expand and create new jobs." DEMOCRAT: Susana Mendoza, 44, Chicago Family: Married, one son Education: Truman State University, B.A. Occupation and experience: Elected Chicago's city clerk in 2011. Served as Illinois state representative from 2001 to 2011. Worked as an advertising account executive and in Chicago's planning department. Illinois' top issues: Lack of a budget, erosion of middle class and increased poverty, and gun violence. On prioritizing bills: "I will continually serve and protect the most vulnerable populations of this state and not allow myself to be party to a political agenda that, for all intent and purposes, holds payments to the most vulnerable in our state hostage." On term limits: "Term limits already exist in the form of elections where voters get to choose who they want to represent them." On the budget gridlock: "It is imperative that all legislative and statewide leadership put partisan politics aside to examine the most comprehensive and effective fiscal strategies to bring about a financial recovery across the state." LIBERTARIAN Claire Ball, 34, Addison Family: Married Education: DeVry University B.A.; Keller Graduate School of Management, M.A. Occupation and experience: Works as an accountant at U.S. Cellular. First time seeking public office. Illinois' top issues: Partisan politics, unfunded pension liabilities and transparency. On prioritizing bills: "I will publish a table of categories that details the payment priority order. The top of that list will be mandatory and court-ordered payments followed by service providers, such as mental health facilities, veteran services and elderly care." On term limits: "Term limits are necessary and I support them and would commit to a term limit." On the budget gridlock: "The politics being played on both sides has caused severe damage to Illinois, and further stop gap budgets will only prolong it." GREEN PARTY Tim Curtin, 67, Hillside Family: Married, two children Education: Attended University of Wisconsin-Madison and Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis Occupation and experience: Union organizer with United Electrical Workers. Served as a union trustee, Oak Park committeeman and chairman of a Green Party committee. Illinois' top issues: A balanced budget, restoring social service funding and raising revenue, like taxing financial transactions at exchanges and boards of trade. On prioritizing bills: "I would pay for education and social services first, since they are a necessity for the well-being of the people of Illinois." On term limits: "We do not need term limits. What is needed is an informed public. If the public understood the positions that these elected officials are taking, maybe they would settle and get something accomplished." On the budget gridlock: "We need a balanced budget so we can stop borrowing heavily as a state." ___ Follow Sophia Tareen at http://twitter.com/sophiatareen.

Share Tweet Aa The crowd’s antics of this week’s Melbourne Cup reminded me that we love to stand out from the crowd, be it through fashion, state of sobriety or ability to choose the winning steed. Share Tweet Aa The crowd’s antics of this week’s Melbourne Cup reminded me that we love to stand out from the crowd, be it through fashion, state of sobriety or ability to choose the winning steed. It is a core of human nature and possibly on a race day a relic of mating prowess, the desire to show my choice is correct and superior to those around me. This function of humanity is a modern marketer’s dream. Advanced product differentiation allows brand strategist to separate their product from the crowd and subvert their competition. Let us take water for a basic example, be it still, sparkling, imported, sourced from an ancient frozen glacier or enhanced with vital vitamins you didn’t previously know existed. It is all the same as the product that pours from your tap - with or without fluoride – good old H2O Traditionally, product differentiation has been perfected by the big corporate end of town where a few companies control a category through a multi-brand strategy in a bid to compete. Few people realise that consumer goods behemoth Proctor & Gamble controls 16 individual brands in the laundry detergent isle. Or that drinks manufacturer Coca Cola possesses 26 individual brands and that’s before you split on sub-brands such as diet, sugar-free, taste-free or can, plastic, bottle. In anyone’s language that’s a lot of foam and fizz. The free market economy has meant that even basic needs of survival are being differentiated and marketed to our desires. The deregulation of industry delivers traditional commodity products in a whole new light. Take electricity – now one not only has to choose between dirty coal, renewables or home generation but also billing format, carbon offset programs and the community engagement of their service provider. Looking to food branding, the trend is advancing rapidly in the age of the modern, educated, selfie conscious consumer. Walking down the supermarket isle delivers a plethora of never ever, free from, sustainably locally sourced, hogwash. The free marketer within me screams “what’s the problem you dirty socialist?!” My problem is that certain parts of the food chain are differentiating product through short-term, focused, negative competition. These ill-thought-out strategies are delivering short-term market advantage through targeting the low hanging fruit of certain production techniques. Further sophistication of brand strategy is required and a macro view towards the triple bottom line needs to be taken before the next marketing campaign is simply rolled out. Agricultural operators too often attack their fellow producers in a bid to differentiate, a strategy fraught with danger as highlighted by Four Corners this week in a spectacular fail for the Tasmanian salmon industry.  Looking at an example close to home, simplistically the beef market today tells us to produce black, grass fed, high marbling, HGP free, welfare accredited, walking rib fillets. That’s a cute paradigm if Australia’s rangelands were actually a giant version of King Island but the reality is that they are not.  In comparison, participants in the wine industry have perfected a sophisticated brand strategy particularly well for the betterment and growth of the sector. Difference of product is celebrated and enjoyed, industry arguments of oak versus double oak or cork verse screw cap are not debated in full visual of the consuming public. Further, while organic or sustainable labels exist, they do not market themselves to the detriment of others. It would be a peculiar dinner party for a debate to ensue about the food miles on the bottle of French fizz and while I might look down upon moscato drinkers, diversity of personal choice is revered. Australian agriculture offers a wide wealth of diversity ripe for the picking for sector enhancing product differentiation. I encourage our marketers to look past the simplistic negative comparison of apple vs orange and commence celebrating the full gamut of the fruit bowl.

Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner appointed business executive Leslie Munger to the post last year after the death of Judy Baar Topinka, who died shortly after winning re-election in 2014. The winner of next Tuesday's special election, coinciding with the presidential contest, will fill the remainder of the term expiring in 2019. Munger is running, along with Democrat Susana Mendoza, Libertarian Claire Ball and Green Party candidate Tim Curtin. Here's a closer look at the candidates: REPUBLICAN: Leslie Geissler Munger, 60, Lincolnshire Family: Married, two sons Education: University of Illinois, B.A.; Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, M.B.A. Occupation and experience: After making an unsuccessful bid for the Illinois House in 2014, she was appointed Illinois comptroller, her first public office. Worked as a brand management executive with Unilever Helene Curtis, for Procter and Gamble and McKinsey and Company Inc. Illinois' top issues: Debt, growing pension and Medicaid costs, and outdated technology. On prioritizing bills: "As a rule of thumb: Those suffering the greatest hardship, and our most vulnerable, should always take precedence." On term limits: "Term limits and redistricting reform are essential for ensuring more accountable government in Springfield." On the budget gridlock: "We can't just cut our way to a balanced budget — we also need new revenue. I believe that can best be achieved through expanding our tax base by making Illinois a place where employers want to locate, expand and create new jobs." DEMOCRAT: Susana Mendoza, 44, Chicago Family: Married, one son Education: Truman State University, B.A. Occupation and experience: Elected Chicago's city clerk in 2011. Served as Illinois state representative from 2001 to 2011. Worked as an advertising account executive and in Chicago's planning department. Illinois' top issues: Lack of a budget, erosion of middle class and increased poverty, and gun violence. On prioritizing bills: "I will continually serve and protect the most vulnerable populations of this state and not allow myself to be party to a political agenda that, for all intent and purposes, holds payments to the most vulnerable in our state hostage." On term limits: "Term limits already exist in the form of elections where voters get to choose who they want to represent them." On the budget gridlock: "It is imperative that all legislative and statewide leadership put partisan politics aside to examine the most comprehensive and effective fiscal strategies to bring about a financial recovery across the state." LIBERTARIAN Claire Ball, 34, Addison Family: Married Education: DeVry University B.A.; Keller Graduate School of Management, M.A. Occupation and experience: Works as an accountant at U.S. Cellular. First time seeking public office. Illinois' top issues: Partisan politics, unfunded pension liabilities and transparency. On prioritizing bills: "I will publish a table of categories that details the payment priority order. The top of that list will be mandatory and court-ordered payments followed by service providers, such as mental health facilities, veteran services and elderly care." On term limits: "Term limits are necessary and I support them and would commit to a term limit." On the budget gridlock: "The politics being played on both sides has caused severe damage to Illinois, and further stop gap budgets will only prolong it." GREEN PARTY Tim Curtin, 67, Hillside Family: Married, two children Education: Attended University of Wisconsin-Madison and Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis Occupation and experience: Union organizer with United Electrical Workers. Served as a union trustee, Oak Park committeeman and chairman of a Green Party committee. Illinois' top issues: A balanced budget, restoring social service funding and raising revenue, like taxing financial transactions at exchanges and boards of trade. On prioritizing bills: "I would pay for education and social services first, since they are a necessity for the well-being of the people of Illinois." On term limits: "We do not need term limits. What is needed is an informed public. If the public understood the positions that these elected officials are taking, maybe they would settle and get something accomplished." On the budget gridlock: "We need a balanced budget so we can stop borrowing heavily as a state." ___ Follow Sophia Tareen at http://twitter.com/sophiatareen.

Florida Travel Orlando Attractions The Daily Disney As Iger's exit nears, Disney takes quiet approach to succession Iger: How Disney Stays on Top Aug. 5 (Bloomberg)- - Bob Iger, chairman and CEO of Walt Disney Co., comments on the company's earnings and the success of Marvel's "Guardians of the Galaxy." He speaks with Jon Erlichman on "Street Smart." (Source: Bloomberg) Aug. 5 (Bloomberg)- - Bob Iger, chairman and CEO of Walt Disney Co., comments on the company's earnings and the success of Marvel's "Guardians of the Galaxy." He speaks with Jon Erlichman on "Street Smart." (Source: Bloomberg) Christopher Palmeri and Carol Hymowitz(c) 2016, Bloomberg Privacy Policy As Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger's scheduled retirement date looms closer, the entertainment giant's search for his replacement remains low-profile, a departure from the open process it previously employed. It's been seven months since heir apparent Tom Staggs' abrupt departure left Iger without a clear-cut successor. The top executive recruiting firms say they haven't been hired by Disney, and Iger hasn't moved members of his executive team into newer or more prominent roles to audition them for the top spot. The company has said only that there is a process in place that the board is following which will include evaluating internal and external candidates. Disney may try to get even bigger to compete with merged AT&T-Time Warner Daniel Miller With a market capitalization of $150 billion, the Walt Disney Co. is an entertainment behemoth. But the Burbank-based company could soon find itself in an unfamiliar position: dwarfed. If regulators approve AT&T’s  $85.4-billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc., the combined company would be far... With a market capitalization of $150 billion, the Walt Disney Co. is an entertainment behemoth. But the Burbank-based company could soon find itself in an unfamiliar position: dwarfed. If regulators approve AT&T’s  $85.4-billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc., the combined company would be far... (Daniel Miller) While there's still time to conduct a search before Iger's contract ends in June 2018, the quiet nature of the current succession planning stands in sharp contrast to the widely watched, five-year bake-off from which Staggs emerged as the leading contender for the job. That's fueling speculation that the board could request that Iger, 65, stay on longer than his scheduled retirement date, something it has already asked of him twice before. "I don't think anyone -- employee, investor or director -- would be hesitant in granting him a new contract," said Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Nomura Securities in New York. "That could happen quickly and easily. Why hasn't it happened already? That's a fair question." Iger said on a May conference call with investors that he didn't have any plans to stick around past the current date. "The board is very actively engaged in a succession process, as it has been actually for some time," he said. "It believes that it has ample time to identify a successor under timing circumstances that will be just fine for the company." A spokeswoman for Disney declined to comment further. Disney board members on the governance and nominating committee, including former Starbucks Corp. CEO Orin Smith, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and former Clorox Chairman Robert Matschullat, didn't respond or declined to comment. Typically it takes a big public company six to seven months to complete a search once the board begins to contact and interview prospective candidates, though additional time is required before that, said Peter Crist, chairman of Crist Kolder Associates, a boutique search firm outside Chicago. "We do lots of mapping projects with the company that take months" about the qualities it wants and needs in a new CEO, Crist said.

Walt Disney World recently began scanning the fingers of young children at the gates in an effort to identify their tickets and keep them from being reused. Meanwhile, SeaWorld... (Sandra Pedicini) At Wal-Mart Stores, executive recruiter Spencer Stuart began consulting with directors about what the company needed in a new leader and who they should consider about a year before Doug McMillon was named the retailer's CEO in November 2013, according to people familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified because they aren't authorized to talk publicly. The board narrowed its search to two internal candidates, McMillon and former head of U.S. operations Bill Simon, about six months before making its final decision. At Procter & Gamble, directors first started talking about replacing then-CEO Bob MacDonald in July 2012 and then asked A.G. Lafley to return as CEO and chairman in May 2013. Lafley, who'd already served as CEO at P&G from 2000 until 2009, immediately reorganized the company into four businesses, each headed by a president who was considered a contender for the CEO post. One of the four, David Taylor, was named global president of home care and subsequently also took charge of P&G's beauty business. In July 2015, Lafley and P&G's other directors named Taylor the consumer giant's new CEO, concluding the two-year process. Iger himself was promoted in 2005 after a six-month search by the board. The executive, who had led Disney's TV operations and international business and had served as president for five years, was evaluated against external candidates with help from Heidrick & Struggles, directors said at the time. He got the top job only after a high-profile campaign by some shareholders to oust then-CEO Michael Eisner. Former directors in a long-running feud with the company still criticized Iger's selection as hasty, but the board said it had been thorough and careful. Until this year, it looked as if Disney's choice for Iger's successor would be more orderly, with a seasoned executive waiting in the wings in the COO position. Staggs had risen to the No. 2 spot at the company after a five-year period in which he and another senior manager, Jay Rasulo, competed with each other to become Iger's successor, even switching jobs to give Staggs more experience operating a business and Rasulo exposure to the executive suite. Rasulo, then serving as chief financial officer, left the company last year after Staggs's promotion to COO. Staggs's exit, after failing to gain the full backing of Iger and the board, left no other internal candidate with both operational experience and a corporate role. Of the six CEOs since Disney's founding in 1923, only Eisner came from the outside. Eisner, who served from 1984 to 2005, joined the company from Paramount Pictures, where he was president. While the board contemplates who will lead the company after June 2018, Iger remains active in planning how to shape Disney's future. In recent weeks, he considered buying Twitter, but decided to pass, partly because of price and partly because of concern about bullying on the social-media site, people familiar with the matter said last month. At an October event in Boston, Iger said it wasn't enough for the company to own key brands like ABC, ESPN and Pixar. Disney needs to have a direct connection to consumers through mobile devices, he said. "What we're thinking about a lot is what role does technology have in distributing from us to the consumer?" he said. "How must we invest in that?" In its search for Iger's replacement, Disney's board should be casting a wide net, looking for candidates inside and outside the company, particularly ones with high-tech chops, said Paul Winum, a senior partner at the management consulting firm RHR International and co-author of "Inside CEO Succession." "The landscape is changing so rapidly, technology is opening up new distribution platforms, overseas markets will be a huge opportunities," he said. "The leadership skills have changed dramatically just in the last two years." When a CEO succession plan unravels, as it did at Disney, the company usually starts thinking about the next, younger generation of executives inside, giving them bigger and different kinds of experience to prepare them for the top job, said Joseph L. Bower, a Harvard Business School professor who has studied succession planning. Disney hasn't made any major changes recently to suggest it's grooming anyone internally, however. "Disney isn't in trouble and currently has a strong CEO in place," Bower said. "But you don't want someone to come in at the last minute to take over."

There’s plenty of facts out there on why recycling is important. The world population is growing, not shrinking, and currently each human being adds significant waste to the planet over his or her lifetime. The most frustrating thing is that in our beautiful state of Yucatan, neither society nor government seems to be concerned about the importance of recycling. It is vital that we create awareness among the local population, and let everybody know that the natural resources on our planet earth are limited and we must make the most to conserve, recycle and reuse whenever possible. It’s not all too difficult to make a difference. 1) Yucatan is not among the top recycling states in Mexico 2) TerraCycle subscriptions number has grown over 200% 3) 47% of the Recycling leading personalities are Millenials 4) Women are more concerned about Recycling than men (Image: TerraCycle) Michael Waas is TerraCycle’s Global Vice President, in charge of Business Development and Client Services, he is responsible for managing and expanding TerraCycle’s 100+ national recycling programs. The programs recycle traditionally non-recyclable waste streams and are run in conjunction with major brands partners (including L’Oreal, Bimbo, Kraft Foods, PepsiCo, Mondelez, P&G, and many more). TerraCycle operates in 20 countries and has pioneered solutions for recycling some of the most challenging waste streams in the world, including chip bags, water filters, cigarette butts, cosmetic packaging and more. TerraCycle’s award-winning programs engage tens of millions of consumers and have diverted billions of pieces of waste; since 2007 the company has paid more than $10 million to schools and non profits in return for waste collected through the programs. Michael joined TerraCycle in 2008 after a chance meeting with founder Tom Szaky through the StartingBloc fellowship. He holds a bachelors in Music and Political Science and an M.A. in Political Science from Central Michigan University. Michael Waas (Photo: TerraCycle) Here is the full interview: Hi Michael, thank you so much for agreeing to have this interview, it is a pleasure to have you here in Mexico and we hope you have a great stay! TerraCycle is known all over the world. Nevertheless, there are some people in Mexico who still don’t know about it. What is Terracycle? What is its purpose and how does The company work? TerraCycle is a global company known for recycling typically non-recyclable materials. Its purpose is to eliminate the idea of waste, meaning we don’t want there to be the concept of waste but rather to have people think about things being repurposed, reused or recycled. The company has several ways it gets the materials we recycle. In Mexico, we have free collection programs that are sponsored by companies that want to take responsibility for their products or packaging. Anyone can sign up for these on our website. What kind of waste is the most interesting to collect for Terracycle and why? We think every kind of waste is interesting to collect, but we really like to collect the most difficult to recycle items that take up a lot of space in landfills. What products can be created with the recycled waste? We recycle the materials into a plastic that can be used in any product that manufacturers want to use recycled plastic. That means the plastic can be used for park benches, garbage bins, bike racks, picnic tables, and much, much more. TerraCycle currently runs over 100 waste collection programs. What is it like having to work with these programs together with the different cultures and traditions around the world?  It can be challenging, but it’s great. We make sure we have a good understanding of the cultures and traditions before we launch in a country. Our employees are often native to that country so that also helps.   Michael Waas and members of the TerraCycle Team in CDMX (Photo: TerraCycle) To date, what recycling program has been the most challenging to create and why? Each of the packaging or products have their own challenges, but those made of multiple materials or layers have the potential to be more difficult and costly because ideally, you want to separate  the materials and recycle them individually. Each recycling program is possible thanks to the partners that work alongside TerraCycle. What is the main ingredient when looking for partnerships with different brands? We love working with companies who recognize the importance of taking responsibility for their packaging and who want to make an impact environmentally. We also look for companies that want to embrace their partnership with us. We are well aware of the success of the programs involving cosmetic packaging and cigarette butts. What other programs would you like to develop in the future? Everything! We want to tackle waste that takes up space in landfills, but shouldn’t have to if there was a way to recycle it. What opportunities do you see in Mexico that you haven’t seen anywhere else? In Mexico, we see a growing movement toward environmental responsibility and an increasing number of companies and individuals who want to take action to reduce landfill waste. Not that we don’t see that elsewhere, but it’s exciting to see it happening in Mexico.  Can you tell us anything about the future programs in Mexico? We have a lot of exciting things in the works for Mexico and when we are able to launch them, they will be the first of their kind in the world.  Michael Waas (Photo: TerraCycle) Thank you so much for your time, Michael, We hope you have a great time in Mexico City. About TerraCycle Mexico: In the month of September TerraCycle Mexico celebrated its 7th anniversary by collecting and recycling waste around the Mexican Republic; said this left a reminder of how we can become collectors within the country and not only contribute to the best of our environment also remunerate other non-profit associations. The most recent number that has been donatied is $ 409,936.74 pesos.

Photo: Getty October 29th 2016 23 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/USA/ FBI Director James Comey who is leading a new investigation into emails related to Hillary Clinton’s private server. Picture: AP Shoba RaoNews Corp Australia Network Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend FBI Director James Comey has sent shockwaves through Hillary Clinton’s campaign after he announced a new review of her emails. The US Senate’s top Democrat, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, has already blasted him for announcing his new review just days before the presidential election, an action he says “may have broken the law.” Allegations Clinton put the United States at risk by using a private email server while US Secretary of State were thrust back into the spotlight when Comey revealed a renewed FBI probe into the matter based on a previously unknown trove of emails. “As soon as you came into possession of the slightest innuendo related to secretary Clinton, you rushed to publicise it in the most negative light possible,” Reid said. “Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law,” Reid added, alleging that Comey had violated the Hatch Act, which bars the FBI from influencing elections. Ms Clinton has demanded the FBI director explain in detail why he had effectively reopened an inquiry declared complete in July, branding Comey’s move “deeply troubling” so close to Election Day. FBI Director James Comey’s announcement that his bureau was reviewing new emails possibly relevant to Hillary Clinton's private email server investigation has thrust him into the public spotlight again just days before Election Day. Picture: APSource:AP According to US media, the probe was renewed after agents seized a laptop used by Clinton’s close aide, Huma Abedin, and her now estranged husband, Anthony Weiner. Comey, a New York native, was made the director of the FBI in 2013 for a 10-year term which will carry on into the new US president’s administration. With a background in corporate law, government, banking and the arms trade, he came to the attention of former US President George W Bush who appointed him deputy attorney general at the Department of Justice (DOJ) in 2003. Comey left DOJ in 2005 to work at one of the world’s largest defence contractors, Lockheed Martin. In 2013, he became the FBI’s leading chief. These are some of the facts we know about him: FBI Director James Comey is at the centre of the renewed FBI email investigation. Picture: APSource:AP COMEY IS A WEALTHY REPUBLICAN Comey is a Republican party member with a reported a net worth of more than US$11 million (AU$14.4 million), CNN reports. Comey and his wife, Patrice, previously listed about US$5 million (AU$6 million) in stocks with a US Senate Committee when he was a nominee for the FBI’s director role. Their investments included a Schwab government money fund, Exxon Mobil, Pepsico, Berkshire Hathaway, Verizon Communications, Proctor & Gamble Co. and Hormel Foods. The couple also said they owned a home worth around US$3 million (AU$3.9 million) in Westport, Connecticut, where he and his wife are licensed foster care parents. In late 2011, the Comeys took in “a newborn boy born prematurely with cocaine in his blood stream and cared for him for six months until he could be placed with a foster-adoptive mother”. The Comeys also donated money to create a foundation to help children in foster care. They are parents to five children: Maurene, Katherine, Brien, Claire and Abby. Pence on Clinton: "no one is above the law"0:32 Republican Vice Presidential nominee Mike Pence says FBI Director James Comey was right in notifying Congress that his agency was again reviewing its investigation into the emails of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton days before the election. October 31st 2016 21 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/ COMEY DISPUTED AMERICA’S WIRETAPPING PROGRAM While working for the Bush administration, Comey questioned a plan to re-authorise its warrantless domestic surveillance program, which led to him drafting a letter of resignation in 2004. While he never sent his letter, he told a Senate Judiciary Committee in 2007 that when he temporarily became in charge of the Justice Department, he refused to re-authorise a secret National Security Agency warrantless wiretap program that the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel determined was illegal. In Comey’s drafted resignation letter, which was published by The Washington Post, he said “the Justice Department and I have been asked to be part of something that is fundamentally wrong.” Shortly after, Comey privately met with Bush, who agreed to “do the right thing, and put the program on a footing that we could certify its legality,” Comey said.

His appointment came after Comey was a known financial supporter of Republicans John McCain and Mitt Romney in their bids to become US president. COMEY PROSECUTED MARTHA STEWART When celebrity lifestyle expert Martha Stewart was charged in 2003 of illegal insider trading, Comey was the man who brought the charges against her. ‘’This criminal case is about lying — lying to the FBI, lying to the SEC, lying to investors,” Comey said at the time, when he was the US attorney for the Southern District of New York. ‘’Martha Stewart is being prosecuted not for who she is, but because of what she did.’’ Stewart was convicted on all counts in 2004 and spent five months in jail. Martha Stewart was one of the high-profile cases that James Comey pursued. Picture: GettySource:Getty Images HE’S INVESTIGATED THE CLINTONS BEFORE Comey’s first investigation of the Clintons was back in the mid-1990s, when he joined the Senate Whitewater Committee as a deputy special counsel. He looked into allegations that the Clintons took part in a fraud connected to a failed Arkansas real estate venture. No charges were ever brought against the Clintons. In 2002 Comey took over an investigation into President Bill Clinton’s 2001 pardon of financier Marc Rich. As a federal prosecutor, Comey looked into Rich, who had been indicted before fleeing the US. At the time, there were accusations that Rich’s ex-wife Denise donated to the Democratic Party, the Clinton Library and Hillary Clinton’s 2000 Senate campaign. In the end, Comey decided not to pursue the case. US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has been linked to another email server probe. Picture: AFPSource:AFP At the FBI, Comey was also involved in the first Clinton email inquiry, which closed without charges in July. Mr Comey said at the time that Mrs Clinton had been “extremely careless” but no criminal charges were warranted. It has now only just resurfaced after Comey alerted members of Congress to the existence of emails that he said could be pertinent to that investigation. The FBI has obtained a warrant to begin reviewing newly discovered emails from longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin that were found on a device seized during an unrelated sexting investigation of Anthony Weiner, a former New York congressman and Abedin’s estranged husband. The official, who has knowledge of the examination, would not say when investigators might complete the review of Abedin’s emails but said they would move expeditiously. In his letter that roiled the White House race, Comey said he’d been briefed about the Abedin emails and had agreed that investigators should take steps to review them. Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks during a rally. Picture: AFPSource:AFP COMEY DOESN’T GIVE A ‘HOOT’ ABOUT POLITICS In July this year, Comey told a US Senate Committee looking at the Clinton email inquiry that he “didn’t give a hoot about politics”. In his own words, he said: “People can disagree, can agree, but they will at least understand that the decision was made and the recommendation was made the way you would want it to be, by people who didn’t give a hoot about politics, who cared about what are the facts, what is the law, and how similar people, all people have been treated in the past.” Despite this, the timing of Comey’s letter less than two weeks before Election Day drew criticism from Democrats and some Republicans who cast it as unprecedented and as potentially tipping the scales in the presidential race in favour of Republican Donald Trump. Energised by the news, the GOP presidential nominee has rallied his supporters, calling the latest developments “worse than Watergate” and arguing that his candidacy has the momentum in the final days of the race. — with wires Add your comment to this story Comments Form Enter your comment here * 1200 characters left Your details Name (as it will appear on the site)* Email Address * Location (optional) Post Options Remember my details Email me if my comment is published News.com.au's Privacy Policy includes important information about our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information (including to provide you with targeted content and advertising based on your online activities).

The businesswoman turned politician is running to keep the job. As comptroller, Munger is the bookkeeper responsible for maintaining the state’s account, and payments in and out of it. That’s no easy job for a state that spends more than it takes in. "Our state simply does not have enough revenue to meet the obligations that we are currently facing," she said. "We need a balanced budget." On her website, Munger keeps a tally of the state’s bill backlog -- $9 billion! Following the death of Judy Baar Topinka in 2014, Munger was appointed comptroller by Gov. Bruce Rauner. "I feel like our state needs people who are willing to step up and serve. I don’t need this job. I actually came out of my nice life to take this appointment," she said. That life was a volunteer in her hometown of Lakeshire following a career in brand marketing. Munger was an executive at Proctor & Gamble and Helene Curtis Industries. She once managed the Suave brand with its various shampoos, lotions, soaps and deodorants. "They called it 'hope in a bottle!'" she said. Munger has not had much to say about her fellow businessman Donald Trump. But she did tell us she thinks he’s successful. "I don’t know enough about his business practices he’s got here, but I will tell you, he’s employed a lot of people and we need to employ more people here in Illinois," she said. To create more jobs here in Illinois, Munger is walking in step with Rauner, backing increases in revenue tied to pro-business reforms. For more than a year, Illinois has been floating along without a budget while the state’s unpaid bills pile up. As the person who must choose which organizations to pay, Munger is trying to turn up the heat on Springfield lawmakers. "For years, our legislature found ways to hide bills, have agencies hold them, sit on them for the last quarter, send them into the next fiscal year. To encourage lawmakers to pass a balanced budget Munger is proposing a "no budget, no pay" bill. Under the legislation, lawmakers would not get their salary until the state gets a budget. It will be a tough sell for state legislators, but Munger still talks about it in her campaign commercial. In this campaign, Munger blew the lid off the donation limits accepting a $260,000 loan from her husband. It allowed her to accept millions from wealthy donors and it allows the state GOP to transfer money into other races. Munger says the move was necessary to get the Republican message out. "I’m following laws passed by the Democrats, voted on by my opponent, and it really allowed them to advantage themselves in past elections to bring in money through the Speaker to shuffle it to other candidates all throughout their party," she said. Munger and her Democratic opponent Susana Mendoza are in the middle of a proxy war. Rauner and his business allies are pumping money into Munger’s campaign while House Speaker Michael Madigan and big unions fun Mendoza. The winner will serve for two years. Mendoza will be featured on Monday's WGN News at Nine.

The wipes can cause blockages – creating 'fatbergs' as they soak up fat in sewers – as well as polluting rivers and seas with tiny plastic fibres. They have surged in popularity in recent years to cover a huge range of purposes, ranging from cleaning babies and removing cosmetics to wiping furniture and dirty floors. Warnings that wet wipes are not flushable are not highly visible at present – something the industry's trade body said its members will rectify. File image As the Daily Mail reported last week, warnings that wipes are not flushable are not highly visible at present – something the industry's trade body said its members will rectify. Now leading manufacturers will have to reconsider guidelines on packaging and have pledged to change them within 18 months. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next The best blusher duos, luxurious lipsticks and Angelina... From colour-coded snacks to hundreds of tiny labelled... Share this article Share The companies include Unilever, which makes the Simple range of beauty wipes, Procter & Gamble, which makes Pampers baby wipes, and Johnson & Johnson, which also produces baby wipes. Edana, the European body for firms producing 'non-woven fabrics', said yesterday: 'We accept we could have done better on this. The makers of wet wipes have agreed to re-label products with warnings not to flush them down the toilet. File image 'All these products should have 'do not flush' logos and labels at the point of extraction – meaning around the lid or other opening – rather than the back of the packet.' The move is set to cover non-flushable wipes. However, there is growing concern over many products marked as 'flushable' that water companies say do not actually break up once down the toilet. The trade body Water UK has called on trading standards officers to investigate whether wipes claiming to be flushable are mislabelled. The industry may be keen to avoid consumer discontent similar to that which engulfed microbeads – tiny abrasive plastic spheres used in cleansing products – which have been criticised for polluting waterways and harming fish and other marine animals all over the world. Tamara Galloway, professor of ecotoxicology at Exeter University, told the Sunday Times: 'We find microplastics in every sea water sample we collect, and most are fibres. 'The UK coast isn't the only area. Scientists around the world are reporting fibres in sea water, fresh water and sediment. We've also found them in the guts of fish and turtles and the tissues of other animals.' However, Edana maintained that 'flushable' wet wipes do disintegrate when disposed of. Edana said: 'Toilet wet wipes for adults may look similar, but they are made of cellulose so break down rapidly in sewers, whereas beauty wipes and baby wipes have to be much stronger and so are made of materials like polyester.' Water companies spend approximately £88million a year clearing an estimated 360,000 blockages, half of which are caused by the disposal of wet wipes. The British market for wet wipes is estimated to be worth about £500million. In the United States, wet wipe manufacturers face a series of law suits from householders in several states over claims that their products are flushable – but consumers claim they have suffered blockages and other damage from the products.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries E-edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site 1985-Present 1831-1950 Illinois comptroller race in spotlight with budget fight Tuesday Nov 1, 2016 at 5:12 PM Nov 1, 2016 at 5:12 PM By Sophia Tareen, The Associated Press CHICAGO -- The race for comptroller, usually a low-profile contest coinciding with Illinois' gubernatorial campaigns, is in the spotlight during a presidential year with a big money special election offering Democrats an unusual chance to oust Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner's hand-picked candidate. The office that controls Illinois' checkbook is open mid-term because incumbent Leslie Munger's appointment is expiring. Rauner named her after Republican Judy Baar Topinka died after her 2014 re-election and Democrats in charge pushed a law requiring a 2016 special election. Munger is vying to keep the job against Democrat Susana Mendoza, Chicago's city clerk aligned with the influential speaker of the Illinois House, and Green Party and Libertarian candidates. The Nov. 8 winner will finish out the last half of the term. The job The comptroller post has been obscure, with perpetual talk of merging it with the treasurer's office, which oversees investments. But it's recently played a more prominent role with Illinois' unprecedented budget gridlock. The office balances laws, court orders and lawmaker-authorized spending to prioritize who gets paid, from state workers to utility companies to social service providers. The office can also be used as a bully pulpit to urge change, something that could impact the administration in power. Illinois' first GOP governor in over a decade remains deadlocked on a full spending plan with Democrats controlling the Legislature. They oppose Rauner's union-weakening, pro-business agenda as a condition to a budget with new taxes. The impasse has complicated the comptroller's job: Some social service providers have closed their doors because of the uncertainty, while others doing business with Illinois are still awaiting payment as the backlog of unpaid bills hovers around $9 billion. The candidates Like several legislative races, the comptroller election has become a proxy war in the battle between Rauner and House Speaker Michael Madigan, who serves as the Democratic Party's leader. Mendoza and Munger have cast themselves as independent from their party leaders, but they've also benefited from their backing. Munger, who called herself Rauner's "budgetary wingman," supports his agenda and took millions in donations from the former venture capitalist and his allies. But she insists she's stood up to Rauner. She delayed paychecks for elected officials during the impasse, and defied his request to not pay public-employee unions the "fair share" dues her office deducts from state worker paychecks. Mendoza, a former legislator, says she's also created waves within her party. She once challenged a Madigan-backed candidate and publicly disagreed with Mayor Rahm Emanuel as clerk when he pitched raising the price of parking permits. But she voted with House Democrats on spending plans and has publicly praised the speaker, include during a 2011 ceremony nominating him to the post he's held almost continuously since 1983. The money The race has also featured extraordinary fundraising. Munger has raised more than double what Mendoza has, mostly due to gigantic donations from wealthy businessmen supporting Rauner. Since 2015's start, Munger collected nearly $9 million, with $1 million from Rauner, $2 million from businessman Richard Uihlein and $5 million from Citadel CEO Ken Griffin. Munger transferred $3 million to the Republican Party, which is pouring money into legislative battles to reduce Democratic supermajorities. Mendoza raised about $3.5 million in the same time period. Roughly one-third comes from unions and a smaller sum from a Democratic Party fund controlled by Madigan. The campaign The two faced off in one televised debate where both interrupted each other often as they defended their records. Munger claimed her opponent voted "in lockstep" with Madigan and her campaign donations come from special interests. She defended her own campaign fund as support from people who want to improve Illinois. "The governor has not bought me," she said on Chicago's WTTW. But Mendoza said the contributions make Munger a "wholly-owned subsidiary" of Rauner. She defended her budget votes as preserving funding for people in need. "I feel like I'm running against Governor Rauner right now," Mendoza said afterward. "The minute he bought the office, it became a proxy between him and myself." *** Leslie Geissler Munger, 60, Lincolnshire, Republican Family: Married, two sons Education: University of Illinois, B.A.; Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, M.B.A. Occupation and experience: After making an unsuccessful bid for the Illinois House in 2014, she was appointed Illinois comptroller, her first public office. Worked as a brand management executive with Unilever Helene Curtis, for Procter and Gamble and McKinsey and Company Inc. Illinois' top issues: Debt, growing pension and Medicaid costs, and outdated technology. On prioritizing bills: "As a rule of thumb: Those suffering the greatest hardship, and our most vulnerable, should always take precedence." On term limits: "Term limits and redistricting reform are essential for ensuring more accountable government in Springfield." On the budget gridlock: "We can't just cut our way to a balanced budget - we also need new revenue. I believe that can best be achieved through expanding our tax base by making Illinois a place where employers want to locate, expand and create new jobs."

Illinois' top issues: Lack of a budget, erosion of middle class and increased poverty, and gun violence. On prioritizing bills: "I will continually serve and protect the most vulnerable populations of this state and not allow myself to be party to a political agenda that, for all intent and purposes, holds payments to the most vulnerable in our state hostage." On term limits: "Term limits already exist in the form of elections where voters get to choose who they want to represent them." On the budget gridlock: "It is imperative that all legislative and statewide leadership put partisan politics aside to examine the most comprehensive and effective fiscal strategies to bring about a financial recovery across the state."

This research report titled 'Baby Diaper Market in MEA 2016-2020' provides an in-depth analysis of the market in terms of revenue and emerging market trends. The report discusses the major drivers that are influencing market growth and the challenges faced by vendors and the market as a whole. Increasing urbanization and rise in disposable income in MEA are the major reasons for the growth of the market. Every year, the urban population is increasing by 3.5% in Africa, and by 4% in the Middle East. There has been an increase in the number of expats in the Middle East due to the opportunities for high income. In addition, people living in urban areas are more aware of hygiene issues and are thus opting for baby diapers. Also, the birth rate in MEA is on the rise, leading to a high demand for baby diapers in the region. Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=54172 Technavio's sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. Technavio's analysts categorize the baby diaper market in MEA into five major segments by product. They are: Disposable diapers Training diapers Cloth diapers Swim pant diapers Biodegradable diapers The top three product segments for the baby diaper market in MEA are: Disposable baby diaper market in MEA An increase in number of dual-income households that are opting for disposable baby diapers because of the convenience they offer, and growing awareness of the importance of maintaining hygiene for babies, are some of the factors driving the demand for disposable baby diapers across the globe. However, in Africa, the demand for disposable baby diapers is still limited. The rural population, which forms more than 59% of the total population, cannot afford disposable baby diapers and hence the demand is low. According to Abhay Sinha, a lead analyst from Technavio, "Even in the urban areas, the usage is still limited due to low awareness and low disposable income. The introduction of innovative materials such as superabsorbent fibers and engineered fabrics, coupled with advances in product design and low cost, will boost the sales of disposable baby diapers in the region during the forecast period Training baby diaper market in MEA Training baby diapers are gaining popularity in developing countries. Most training baby diapers have flexible sides that can be easily pulled down by a baby, and therefore aid in toilet training. These diapers are designed like underwear and are increasingly being used to help children switch from using diapers to using toilets. Training baby diapers are usually used for toddlers of two years or more. The demand for training baby diapers is expected to increase mainly from the working-class women, who find it more convenient to use these diapers, compared with cloth baby diapers, and from people who can afford and continue to buy diapers even after the baby is more than two years of age. The demand for such diapers is expected to be low from the rural parts of Africa, since people in the region cannot afford to buy diapers and usually stop buying them after the baby is more than two years. Cloth baby diaper market in MEA Cloth baby diapers are low-priced, can be reused, and are eco-friendly. They are also safe for a baby's skin as they do not have any harmful chemical ingredients. Most fitted diapers come with Velcro straps. This eliminates the need to use pins, which are potentially hurtful. Cloth baby diapers are popular in most developing countries due to their low costs. Although in recent times, the market for fitted cloth diapers has lost its share to other categories of diapers, some consumers still prefer them as they are both economical and eco-friendly. "The demand in the cloth baby diaper market is expected to come from the rural population in Africa, which cannot afford disposable baby diapers. Cloth baby diapers are also popular in the Middle East. There is a new trend of cloth baby diaper libraries emerging in the region," asserts Abhay. The top vendors highlighted by Technavio's research analysts in this report are: Kimberly-Clark P&G SCA Unicharm Browse Related Reports: Global Diaper Market 2016-2020 Adult Diapers Market in the Americas 2015-2019 Adult Diaper Market in the APAC 2015-2019 Do you need a report on a market in a specific geographical cluster or country but can't find what you're looking for?

X West Virginia governor eyes Irish strategy in post-coal era Governor Earl Ray Tomblin attracts investment as coal production declines Tue, Nov 1, 2016, 17:00 Charlie Taylor Governor of West Virginia Earl Ray Tomblin: “Ireland has done a great job in setting competitive prices and we’re trying to do more of that.” Photograph: Jim Stem/Bloomberg         Donald Trump has made plenty of outlandish promises during the US presidential campaign. A vow to bring back coal mining jobs to West Virginia might not rank among the worst of them, but it has certainly led to a headache for the state’s governor. Earl Ray Tomblin, a Democrat who was has been governor of West Virginia since November 2011, is involved in a concerted effort to encourage international investors to the state as it seeks to diversify away from coal. However, Trump’s commitment to reopen mines has gone down well with disillusioned voters who do not hold out much hope for Tomblin’s promise of a brighter tomorrow. With a poverty rate of 18.5 per cent, West Virginia is ranked among the poorest states in the US and, while there are many who dismiss Trump’s mining pledge as a fantasy, there are many who are attracted to it. “Coal has taken care of people in this state for generations, from the time they left school to their graves, but those days are gone and some people don’t want to believe it,” Tomblin tells The Irish Times on a recent visit to Dublin. “I hate it as much as they do because I come from a mining region, but there’s no magic wand that can be waved that will put miners back to work, which is why there is little choice other than to try to diversify.” West Virginia may not be particularly well known to most people in Ireland but politicians there sure know a lot about us. The US state is looking to Ireland as a role model as it seeks to move away from coal and encourage companies in other sectors to set up shop in the region. “We’ve learned that there are a lot of similarities between Ireland and West Virginia,” Tomblin says. “Ireland has very smartly been able to successfully position itself as a small country in a very big economy. We are trying to do something similar by repositioning our economy away from coal. I think we have the assets to do it.” ADVERTISEMENT West Virginia historically has thrived on traditional energy and manufacturing industries such as chemicals and polymers, aerospace, automotive and wood products. However, the state is increasingly seeking to attract innovative, technology-based businesses that will provide a more sustainable economic future. Lower energy prices, technological improvements in the oil and gas space, and tougher environmental laws mean that West Virginia has no choice but to make itself less dependent on coal. However, with the energy sector still accounting for about 17 per cent of the state’s GDP – even after the closure of many mines and a 40 per cent drop in exports – saying goodbye to the black stuff isn’t easy. According to the Energy Information Agency, West Virginia ranked fourth among all states in total energy production in 2013, producing 4.6 per cent of the nation’s total. The state currently provides 15 per cent of the entire US coal supply. However, production has declined sharply in recent years, from a peak of 158 million tonnes in 2008 to a projected 73 million tonnes this year. “We realise that we’ve got to change but that takes a little bit of time,” Tomblin says. “Everyone still associates West Virginia with energy; it is like the 800lb elephant in the room. It is there and we would to be idiots not to continue to take advantage of the resources we have. But we have also become a more diversified economy in recent years.” Since 2005, West Virginia has seen more than $22 billion in new business investments. More than 140 global companies now have operations in the State with firms such as Amazon, Bayer, Toyota, Procter & Gamble, Macy’s and Lockheed Martin among them. Irish firms such as Ardagh Group, CRH/Oldcastle Precast and Randox Laboratories also have a presence there. The state is seeking to further boost investment, hence the trade mission to Britain and Ireland. “Ireland has done a great job in setting competitive prices and we’re trying to do more of that,” the governor adds. “We’ve reduced business taxes from 9.5 per cent to 6 per cent in recent years, introduced programmes to retrain people, and like Ireland, have tried to create flexibility and stability so that companies considering West Virginia know what to expect. “We don’t see Ireland as a competitor but as a country we can learn from. We’ve paid a lot of attention to what it has done to attract international investment and during this visit have met with the IDA to discuss what we have in common and how we can work closer together to benefit both sides.” Emerging sectors in West Virginia include plastics, biometrics and biosciences, advanced energy, distribution and business and information services. It is also doing more to promote tourism in the region and has become something of a hub for government agencies who want to be close to Washington but far enough away in case of a terrorist attack. “The federal government has been moving critical operations to states like West Virginia, which is only 45 minutes away by air and a couple of hours away by road. The US treasury has a major presence here, as does the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA)]and the FBI, through which we have the largest fingerprint repository in the US.” Nonetheless, with so many job losses arising from the mining sector and not enough new ones to go around as yet, Tomblin’s strategy has not met with widespread praise. The Democrat recently risked further ire by voicing his support for Hillary Clinton for president, in a state that has shown strong support for her opponent. ADVERTISEMENT “Trump will carry West Virginia but we’ll have a Democratic governor for the state and a Democratic president,” he says. The incumbent, who is not running for re-election due to term limits, may be exasperated by Trump’s comments, but he says that in terms of investment opportunities, they are more of a distraction than a threat. “There’s been plenty of anti-trade talk in these elections but I’d say you guys have bigger worries with Brexit than we do with Trump.”       Topics: Donald Trump Earl Ray Tomblin Hillary Clinton Energy Information Agency Fbi IDA Ireland National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration Amazon Ardagh Bayer CRH Lockheed Martin Macy's Procter and Gamble Randox Laboratories Toyota Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Markets Goodbody warns of Trump’s ‘beggar thy neighbour’ plans Work Pre-meetings key to successful meetings on contentious issues Gaelic Games Clare’s Ballyea clinch maiden Munster hurling title Economy Fast-track pay restoration: is it economically feasible?

"Following" : "Follow"}} November 01, 2016 9:56am   Comments Share: Related Benzinga's Top Upgrades Wall Street's M&A Chatter From November 11-13 Related PG Benzinga's Top Initiations The Trump Market Is Killing A Couple Of Popular Trading Strategies Procter & Gamble's (PG) CEO David Taylor Hosts Analyst Day Meeting 2016 (Transcript) (Seeking Alpha) Morgan Stanley’s Dara Mohsenian believes that the weak positioning of Coty Inc (NYSE: COTY) within the beauty industry, along with high execution risks, are already priced into the valuation discount of the stock, compared to its CPG peers. Mohsenian re-initiated coverage of the company with an Equal-Weight rating and price target of $24. Weak Positioning “We continue to view Coty as disadvantaged within the attractive beauty category,” the analyst mentioned, while pointing out that the stock has declined 26 percent from its May peak. Mohsenian expects the stock to continue to be under pressure in the near term, driven by weak top line results, which in turn are expected due to the soft scanner data and distractions due to the Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG) deal. “However, as we move close to the summer of CY17 we do see eventual trading upside as the market focuses more on FY18 at some point and Coty provides greater financial clarity,” the analyst went on to say. Reasons For Weakness Mohsenian believes Coty is skewed to lower growth subcategories and price points in the beauty space than its large public peers. In addition, the company’s brands entail weak brand equity, which is highlighted by Coty’s historical market share losses. According to the Morgan Stanley report, “Coty licenses about 40 percent of its portfolio, which means it deserves a lower valuation for lack of ownership. Working with third parties also makes Coty's portfolio more complex to manage, particularly as the company tries to cull SKUs.” There have been reports that Coty intends to acquire U.K.-based Good Hair Day, a manufacturer of high end hair care products, for significantly more than £400 million. In fact, Moody’s sees this acquisition as credit negative for Coty.

Technavio defines an emerging trend as a factor that has the potential to significantly impact the market and contribute to its growth or decline. Brijesh Kumar Choubey, a lead analyst from Technavio, specializing in research on cosmetics and toiletry sector, says, "Consumer demand for customized hair solutions that address specific concerns has been growing in the haircare market in Africa. A growing number of consumers in the region are preferring products that protect the scalp and hair quality and repair damage." Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=53808 Technavio's sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. The top three emerging trends driving the haircare market in Africa according to Technavio consumer and retail research analysts are: Partnership of vendors with salons to gain visibility and establish products Growing use of online channel by brands Leveraging social media platforms Partnership of vendors with salons to gain visibility and establish products Hair salons are booming in South Africa and many manufacturers are partnering with these salons to gain visibility and establish their products in the market. Some popular salons in Nigeria are Apples Oranges, Bruno's Palace, Make Me Beauty Place, Touch of Glamour, and Bobby's Signature. The Darling brand, a key brand in hair extension products on the continent, has strong presence at salons and is a preferred brand by hair stylists. Modern Hair Beauty (formerly Wella SA) distributes the products of multiple brands such as System Professional, Sebastian Professional, Kadus Professional, and Nioxin. Many beauty salon chains also have their own chain of beauty and cosmetics products. Popular professional hair serums available are It's A 10 Miracle Styling Serum Hair Styling Products, Phyto Phytolisse Ultra-Glossing Finishing Serum, Phyto Phytocyane Revitalizing Serum, and TIGI Bed Head Control Freak Serum. Growing use of online channel by brands E-commerce is growing in South Africa. The number of Internet users in the country has grown substantially over the years and e-retailers are looking to tap into this consumer segment. Business to consumer's web portals operate orders on nationwide basis in many of the East African countries, and register nearly 1,000 orders per day in certain territories. The online channel is expected to develop significantly over the next five years, fueled by the emerging middle-class population. Africa's middle-class population is growing in number and financial strength. Also, by 2050, almost 50% of the continent is expected to have access to the Internet and online shopping will grow to account for at least 11% of retail sales. Jumia, a Nigeria-based online retailer, is one of the key players in the e-commerce business. E-commerce platforms such as Mall For Africa connect the region's customers with global brands. Such platforms serve as a conduit for customers to access more than 150 global brands. Most of its customers prefer purchasing US and UK based brands. Mall For Africa has also created an MFA WebCard that can be loaded with US dollars to function like a debit card in order to simplify the e-commerce experience of its customers. Leveraging social media platforms "Social media marketing is being implemented extensively by almost every company to ensure enhanced product visibility," says Brijesh. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, WhatsApp, and YouTube are the most powerful social media platforms. L'Oréal launched its campaign named LoveMyColor in 2016 through a microsite LoveMyColor.com. This campaign was designed to relaunch the company's Dark and Lovely Fade Resist hair color brand for black women. The campaign is also featured on Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, and YouTube. In 2016, P&G, under its My Black is Beautiful initiative launched the hair truth campaign, a community building program aimed at educating consumers with curly hair or African hair. The campaign unites the P&G brands Pantene, Head Shoulder, Herbal Essences, and Aussie. The program features five informative webisodes and includes educational components on social media.

"The combined overall revenue of selected eight MNCs during the FY 16 registered a total of $9,436.66 million, whereas the combined revenue of selected seven Indian FMCG is $11,066.46 million," the Assocham-TechSci Research report said. According to the joint study, which observed performance analysis of selected Indian FMCG companies, the highest profit after tax margin is maintained at 25.48 per cent by ITC during 2015-16, as compared to Procter & Gamble Hygiene & Health Care among selected leading MNC players in FMCG sector in India, which maintained the highest profit after tax margin at 17.03 per cent. The study stated that Britannia Industries stood second among firms in terms of revenue of $1,222.75 million during 2015-16 and has registered revenue growth of 10.76 per cent as compared to 2014-15. However, its after-taxes profit margin (PAT) stood at 9.43 per cent, which is comparatively lower than its peers in the sector. The performance of Dabur India is next to ITC in terms of PAT registered at 16.34 per cent, followed by Godrej Consumer Products at 15.37 per cent, the report said. "About the performance of Amul, although the company has revenue $743.69 million, which is slightly more than Godrej Consumer Products Ltd., its PAT margin is least amongst others at just 0.32 per cent," the joint study said. "In case of Amul, the reason can be the fact of controlled prices and nature of milk and milk-made products." After analysing the performance of selected multinational companies of FMCG sector in India, the study has observed that Hindustan Unilever is leading with its revenue of $4,921.10 million with 3.84 per cent year-on-year growth in the revenue. However, the PAT margin of the company during the year is $628.06 million or 12.76 per cent, which is comparatively lower than its competitor. The report further cited that the performance of Glaxosmithkline Consumer Healthcare has recorded 15.94 per cent PAT margin, followed by Colgate-Palmolive (India) with 13.85 PAT margin. About the performance of PepsiCo India, the report added that the company could not make it possible to have satisfactory overall profit as there was negative PAT margin by 2.18 per cent. --IANS ppg/ask/vt SEARCH About Us Data Center Cloud Computing Servers Cloud Applications Hosting MPLS VPN Network Services Disclaimer Privacy Policy Careers Feedback Advertise Digital © Copyright Sify Technologies Ltd, 1998-2016.

Asian Scientist Newsroom | October 27, 2016 | Academia AsianScientist (Oct. 31, 2016) - The National University of Singapore (NUS) won in three categories of the Institution of Chemical Engineers’ (IChemE) awards, part of IChemE’s Global Awards program which celebrates excellence and innovation in chemical engineering. A collaborative team from NUS and Iowa State University received the Energy Award for their project ‘Resource recovery from wastes,’ a novel waste treatment technology that converts urban waste streams into biofuels and other useful products. NUS also picked up the Research Project of the Year Award for their project ‘Membrane dehumidifiers to reduce energy consumption,’ in which the team have developed foil-like membranes to sieve out water molecules in air conditioning systems, reducing energy consumption by 35 percent. Ms. He Jinsong from NUS was named best Young Chemical Engineer in Research, sponsored by Shell. After narrowly missing out on the award in 2014 and 2015, her latest work has seen her develop a full-scale production system for decontaminating water. The Institute of Chemical and Engineering Sciences, part of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research, took the Process Safety Award, sponsored by MMI Engineering. The institute was recognized for their development of safety and environmental assessment. Their combined approach enables engineers to balance risk to the environment and workforce safety, to minimize potential trade-offs. There were winners from industry as well. Ms. Betty Tsai of Proctor & Gamble International took the trophy for Young Chemical Engineer in Industry, also sponsored by Shell. Her work at P&G is focused on skincare consumer products, where she has designed the innovation process from start to finish. Glaxo Wellcome Manufacturing took the Sustainable Technology Award, for their Jurong waste heat recovery project which saw them produce enough steam from waste heat to run their site at 1 Pioneer Sector 1, significantly reducing their carbon footprint. ——— Source: Institution of Chemical Engineers.

Galley's brush with being targeted online for the intent of sex trafficking prompted her to empower girls far beyond her signature GIRL TALK program, giving girls a powerful message that begins with an ordinary blank canvas bag. Galley has a gift - she's showing tween and teen girls how to utilize their inner "Girl Power", improving their confidence and self-esteem with a relatable message. Just recently, she was awarded a Distinguished Service Award by Austin, Texas Mayor Steve Adler for her efforts in building a new revolution of self-worth among young girls on a global scale. "When girls and women empower each other, our 'Girl Power' creates a force that not only shatters glass ceilings, but changes the world," said Girls Above Society President and Founder Lauren Galley. One of Galley's most treasured accomplishments is the establishment of her non-profit organization, Girls Above Society at age fifteen. The organization's GIRL TALK curriculum empowers young girls to become confident and know their self-worth as they face the tough pressures of today's media driven society. "I had the opportunity to connect with Forever Found in Simi-Valley, CA. through the local Soroptimist chapter. I knew this would be a perfect launch for Project Warrior." The hand delivery of these bags launched my goal of reaching girls in every U.S. state," said Galley. Each warrior bag is hand stamped revealing the powerful quote "Throw me to the wolves. I will come back leading the pack." signifying the girl's bravery and strength. The hand painted arrow represents the positive force and direction their lives can lead, giving them a mindset of self-worth and success. The added gold glitter is a reminder to smile and shine...today is a good day. Dana Wendt, CEO and founder of JOUZGE, a Golden Family Company has partnered with Galley dedicating a monetary amount from each treat sold to further impact Project Warrior and it's empowerment of rescued human trafficked girls. Wendt herself is a survivor of childhood sexual abuse and feels this mission is two fold. "Project Warrior benefits the survivors of trafficking as well as bringing awareness to teen girls on what predatory behavior looks like. It is important to understand this is happening every day here in our country, our states, our cities and in our towns. This issue cannot be dismissed. There is a great need here and we believe Project Warrior will succeed in addressing these girls challenges as well as educating girls everywhere about human trafficking," said Wendt. Galley reports a new shipment arrived this week for girls at Vista Maria in Illinois, adding a second state in her quest for all 50. Alpha Delta Pi alumni Karen Banker Collins is the liaison assisting Galley, a current Alpha Delta Pi, in the Illinois warrior bag delivery. Galley's future goals for Project Warrior include adding an extension beyond the warrior bags, awarding girls with educational scholarships that will further advance rescued girls, giving them additional tools to live a successful future, and rise above their tragic past of human trafficking. Lauren Marie Galley is a 21-year-old award winning teen mentor, TEDx Speaker, Amazon Best Selling Author, a recognized 2016 Changemaker by The White House for the State of Women Summit and President of Girls Above Society, a non-profit 501 (c)(3) organization dedicated to empowering tween and teen girls to be confident while maintaining positive morals and values as they face the tough pressures of today's media driven society. Lauren's GIRL TALK curriculum reaches girls as she travels across the U.S. and has officially launched in the Massillon School District 2016-2017 school year. Lauren is a contributor to Huffington Post and can also been seen on TED giving her TEDx Talk titled #TextMe: The Elimination of Human Interaction. This talk gives a powerful look at the effect modern technology has on the shaping of today's youth and their forms of communication. Lauren's Ambassadorship with Secret Deodorant's Mean Stinks Campaign in conjunction with Teen Vogue has given her a powerful platform to continue empowering girls to end the girl-on-girl bullying for good. Proctor & Gamble's "Niceness Pays" $10,000 scholarship was awarded to Lauren in January of 2016. Lauren lives in Texas where she attends Sam Houston State University studying Psychology where she is proud to be the Leadership Chair of Alpha Delta Pi. Her latest scholastic honors ~ Student Excellence Award for Service 2013 and 2014, Rising Leader of Alpha Delta Pi, 2015, Deans List 2015 and Mayor's Distinguished Service Award 2016.

Randall Stephenson, chairman and chief executive officer of AT&T, left, speaks while Jeff Bewkes, chairman and chief executive officer of Time Warner, listens during the WSJDLive Global Technology Conference last Tuesday. Credit: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg Most Popular Since AT&T agreed to buy Time Warner for $85.4 billion, executives and the press have suggested that the combination will benefit marketers and consumers with a new level of addressable advertising. "Our TV, mobile and broadband distribution and direct customer relationships provide unique insights from which we can offer addressable advertising and better tailor content," AT&T Chairman-CEO Randall Stephenson said in announcing the deal Oct. 22. The tie-up will allow "more innovation in advertising," Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said, making ads "more effective and of interest to you in one house versus someone else in a different house." "Individualized Ads on TV Could Be One Result of AT&T-Time Warner Merger," The New York Times reported Wednesday. Whatever benefits the pact has, however, a lot more addressable TV advertising isn't likely among them. If the deal closes, it's true that sales teams at Time Warner's Turner unit will probably be able to offer the addressable ads that AT&T already sells through DirecTV. Turner networks such as TBS and CNN could make their national ad time available to AT&T's addressable offering, now limited to the two minutes per hour pay-TV operators sell. And combining AT&T and Time Warner's consumer data could bolster the companies' ad targeting online, including in new video products down the road. But the odds are long that any of that means neighbors watching the NBA on TNT will see differing, tailored ads more often than today. For one thing, AT&T's addressable TV advertising is available for 14 million households among DirecTV subscribers. Buying Time Warner doesn't expand that. And marketers care more about wider reach than additional time in a limited pool. An AT&T spokeswoman said the merger will foster innovation across screens. "The combined company will be positioned to expand distribution options to disrupt traditional models by making content available on every device and innovating with more ad-supported content," she said. "We'll still have big screen TVs at home, but wide-scale mobile video viewing is what customers want. As a single company, we are uniquely positioned to deliver on this mobile experience, and disrupt the traditional entertainment model by pushing the boundaries on mobile content availability for the benefit of customers." A Time Warner spokesman referred to executives' prior comments. Ad buyers and analysts are mixed on the prospects. Related Stories Addressable TV Ads Will Surge 120% This Year (to a Very Small Slice of Total) A satellite operator like AT&T's DirecTV can adopt addressable technology more easily than cable companies, which have grown by acquiring a patchwork of rivals running different systems, noted Tracey Scheppach, founder and CEO at Matter More Media, a new agency. "Cable operators need to deploy technology on a market-by-market basis to enable addressability, whereas the architecture for AT&T and DirecTV require just turning on an East Coast and West Coast feed," she said. Owning a content provider such as Time Warner also eases the way to offering and measuring its inventory, an area ripe for friction in carriage negotiations with outsiders, she said. Rich Greenfield, media analyst at BTIG, was skeptical. "I think we are moving toward an ad-free world," he said. "If AT&T buying Time Warner will allow it to deliver the right ad to the right person and cut the ad load … that would be great. But the greatest advancement the TV industry has made in advertising has been to disable fast forwarding." Limited reach is only one reason addressable TV hasn't taken off. There's also a premium in cost and effort, on all sides, to get deals done. If Turner sold addressable inventory in TBS's "Full Fontal With Samantha Bee," it would come out of the ratings points it could deliver to traditional advertisers. Turner would also need to line up several advertisers to split one slot, or find one advertiser with different creative executions to run depending on the home. Finding a multi-brand advertiser such as Procter & Gamble might be a relatively easy solution, but P&G has lately been saying that targeting on Facebook, at least, isn't worth the trouble and cost for most household brands. More intelligent ad buys may be the most immediate result, suggested Dave Morgan, CEO and founder at Simulmedia, a targeted TV specialist. "The notion that we will see addressable TV at massive scale just because of this deal I don't buy into," he said. "But I think this merger will be a catalyst for more data-driven TV advertising."
