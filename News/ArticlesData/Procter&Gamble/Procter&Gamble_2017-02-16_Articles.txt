 Billionaire investor Nelson Peltz took a huge stake in Procter & Gamble — and P&G's stock is soaring Portia Crowe Feb. 14, 2017, 5:12 PM 2,965 facebook linkedin twitter email print YouTube/Gillette Trian Fund Management, the activist hedge fund cofounded by billionaire Nelson Peltz, has taken a stake in Procter & Gamble, The Wall Street Journal reports. P&G's stock was up 4% in after-hours trading on the news. Trian is the second activist hedge fund to invest in P&G in recent years. In 2012, Bill Ackman's Pershing Square invested, leading then-CEO Robert McDonald to step down within a year, the Journal reported. P&G is the maker of everything from Gillette to Crest to Pantene to Tampax. Peltz said in December that he had taken a new position but did not disclose which company it was in. His firm raised a special fund in recent months exclusively for its P&G position, according to the Journal report.  A number of other hedge funds disclosed new positions in 13-F filings on Tuesday.

Posted 15 Feb 2017 23:15 Updated 16 Feb 2017 05:50 Procter & Gamble's Head & Shoulders is seen in a store in Manhattan, New York, U.S., August 1, 2016. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Procter & Gamble Co , maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors, will face ever greater pressure to slice costs and slow-growing divisions now that activist investor Trian Partners is a major shareholder. P&G's shares hit a two-year high on Wednesday after Trian disclosed a stake in the consumer products company, which is already trying to slim down by selling unprofitable brands. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters that Trian currently holds more than US$3 billion of P&G's stock. Trian has a track record of pressuring large consumer companies to break up, a history investors and analysts are seizing on with the fund's newest investment. But Trian has yet to publish a white paper, and the firm's exact plan remains to be seen. In addition to breaking P&G into separate companies, analysts speculated that Trian could press for more brand divestitures and heavy-handed cost overhauls. "Absent a two- or three-way breakup, we suppose Peltz could also call for a 3G-like attack on the company's cost structure," said Don Bilson, director of research at Gordon Haskett, which tracks M&A and activism. Bilson was referring to 3G Capital, a private equity firm that embraces a hard-core cost cutting strategy known as zero-based budgeting. Cincinnati-based P&G is a US$225 billion behemoth, selling brands such as Crest toothpaste to consumers across the globe. Bernstein Research said in January 2016 it conducted a survey of P&G's institutional investors and found that two-thirds favored a break-up. A break-up could result in the beauty, grooming and healthcare division becoming one company, with P&G separating out everything else, such as its laundry and diaper units, Bernstein said in the report. Regardless of whether it wants a break-up, Trian is expected to pressure P&G to keep reducing costs while increasing revenues, a mantra it presses all of its companies to embrace. P&G has been selling off unprofitable brands, including 41 beauty brands to Coty Inc , and focusing on core brands such as Tide, Pampers and Gillette to revive sluggish sales. However, those efforts have failed to boost its stock much beyond where it traded two years ago. Braun, Clearblue, Bounty and Charmin are other brands that Trian could press to be sold, bankers said on Tuesday. P&G's annual meeting is not until October and its deadline to nominate directors expires in June, meaning the company and Trian have several months to negotiate whether or not to give the investor board representation or take the matter to a shareholder vote. P&G's shares were up 3.7 percent at US$91.12. The stock was the biggest boost to the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday but has lagged peers and the S&P 500 index during the past three years. TRIAN Trian, founded in 2005 by Nelson Peltz, Ed Garden and Peter May, focuses mainly on consumer brand companies, industrial firms and financial companies. The firm has US$14 billion in assets under management. Trian said in a filing on Tuesday that it held 6.4 million shares, worth US$556.8 million as of Dec. 31 of last year. That position has grown to more than US$3 billion as of Tuesday, the person familiar with the matter told Reuters, which would make Trian a top 10 shareholder. Trian pressured PepsiCo Inc to spin off its beverage business from its snacks division, a campaign that the company never heeded though it did hand the investor a board seat in 2015 to make peace. In 2012, under pressure from Trian, Kraft spun off its North American grocery business and its global snack division to become Mondelez International, the maker of Oreos, Cadbury chocolate and Wheat Thins. Trian and P&G declined to comment on Wednesday. "We see Trian's P&G stake as late in the company's turnaround process," RBC Capital markets analyst Nik Modi wrote. Modi said Chief Executive David Taylor is appropriately managing the business and targeting the three major buckets that Trian could address: portfolio alignment, cost and revenues.

"Facebook could easily become the world's largest entertainment company, one that is worthy of a far higher multiple than it gets," the "Mad Money" host said. The same goes for Apple, Cramer said. Analysts who tell the story of Apple are looking at it as if it is some sort of dead end of innovation. Yet they are forgetting that the iPhone device has a steady built-in stream of revenue that continues to grow. Cramer found this to be reminiscent of Gillette, with users paying a fortune for razors over the span of their lifetime. Hence, Trian, the investment firm run by Nelson Peltz, announced a hefty stake in Proctor & Gamble. "If we looked at Apple through the same lens as Gillette, it might very well be the best stock a man can get," Cramer said. Rafael Marchante | Reuters Cramer is sick and tired of investors doubting that the stock market could really power higher. It is the real deal, he said, and he decided to prove it. "It is one of the oldest theories when it comes to stocks that the transports have to confirm the strength in the Dow industrials before you can trust a rally … that is exactly what is happening," Cramer said. The theory of transports pertains to the notion that the transports group must make a new high at the same time as the Dow for the market to have solid grounding. Copper is often used as a barometer for the health of the global economy. Naturally, Jim Cramer's interest was naturally piqued when the red metal made a big breakout to the upside recently. "Copper's strength is part of the traditional metrics that define economic growth and it can be a part of the rational justification for what so many believe is an irrational rally," Cramer said. When demand for copper increases, that means industrial activity is on the rise because copper is used to make a wide array of things from new factories, to new houses and automobiles. However, Cramer did note that he doesn't know if demand has increased because there have been major production cuts, which could signal the jump is supply driven rather than due to stronger demand. Most investors probably don't associate General Electric with technology, but CEO Jeff Immelt is now wagering a bet that it can become a top 10 software company by 2020. "The proof of the pudding is reality. Our orders are growing 25 percent a year. We are kind of first among equals in the industrial internet. We can play. We can do this," Immelt said. When GE began investing in technology, Immelt said he didn't do so with the notion that it had to become a software company. Instead, the industrial assets that the company sells are surrounded by sensors and produce a massive amount of data. It was simply an investment to protect its installed base. Cramer also got the take of the future of digital from Adobe Systems' CEO Shantanu Narayen. Adobe is the leading maker of digital media and marketing software. Adobe has steadily transformed itself in the last few years into more of a cloud computing play. The company also made strides to enter the red-hot field of artificial intelligence with Sensei, its AI platform that uses machine learning to help computers match images and understand both the meaning and sentiment of documents. Narayen told Cramer that the future of video also could mean more monetization of the content. "There is more content that is out there than there has ever been before, and this revival of content when coupled with the appropriate advertising — that is going to be the business model that evolves on the web," Narayan said.

This could result in a bearish double-top back to 7270 which sees the index breach an imperfect February uptrend’s support at 7280. Bulls looking for a break back above 7285 to rekindle optimism. Bears desire a test of yesterday’s 7270 post-close lows. Watch levels: Bullish 7285, Bearish 7270. Calls for a negative European open come in spite of another record stateside close and global equities attaining their best since May 2015, still buoyed by hopes of Trump reflation, tax cuts, bank deregulation and US monetary policy normalisation while decent US data prints help out too. After rallying on US rate hike hopes, a USD pullback from 1-month highs has delivered hindering FX strength elsewhere producing a mixed bag for Asian equities overnight. A Yen bounce is holding back Japan’s Nikkei along with persistent weakness for Toshiba. Australia’s ASX is higher after decent jobs data and oil prices finding their feet despite yet another US inventory build and production increase (pattern developing? Short covering? OPEC cuts?). Miners supported by base metals holding up, precious metals even rallying on a combination of weaker USD and technicals (bullish flags). China and Hong Kong equities outperform without clear drivers. US equity markets closed at record highs for the fifth day in a row as investor optimism continues to build, with yesterday’s drivers including much stronger than expected inflation and retail sales data, tax cut hopes, Fed Chair Yellen reiterating her hawkish outlook and an eruption of bullishness in Healthcare as a leading fund manager took a $3.5bn stake in Dow component Procter & Gamble. This helped the Dow Jones strengthen by 0.5%, a mark mirrored by the S&P 500, while the Nasdaq and Russell 2000 outperformed, up 0.6% and 0.7% respectively. Crude Oil prices are beginning to tick lower this morning, having held flat overnight despite a larger than expected build in US Crude inventories that initially sent prices higher before paring gains shortly afterwards. Both US and Brent crude remain hampered by week long falling highs resistance, with the former benchmark back below $53 while Brent holds above $55.50. Gold is trading marginally higher this morning having fallen from overnight highs, as a weaker US dollar boosts demand for commodities. Having briefly touched $1237 while the dollar was at its weakest level before paring gains, the precious metal has now found support at $1233 intersecting support, with further movements in FX space likely to drive investor sentiment today - as has been the case throughout the week. In focus today, on a light day for macro data, will most likely be the plethora of European speakers while the meeting of G20 Foreign Ministers takes place in Berlin. The latter will likely provide an ongoing commentary throughout the day concerning recent major geopolitical events - North Korea, Brexit and Trump - as messrs BoJo (UK), Rex-T (US) and their Russian counterpart Lavrov meet for the first time. Other highlights include German Chancellor Merkel and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau at a joint conference (coinciding with European Parliament approving the EU-Canada trade deal yesterday), the ECB’s Nowotny and Coeure shortly after the release of the ECB Minutes from January’s policy meeting at 12:30pm, while EU President Juncker and the Fed’s Williams both speak after the European market close. Datawise, today is limited to a single dump of US data at 1:30pm, with January Housing Starts and Building Permits seen flat, Jobless Claims (Initial forecast higher, Continuing expected lower) and the Philly Fed Business Outlook (Feb) falling back to 18 from January’s 3-year high of 23.6.

Releasing the report, Khosla highlighted to advertisers the importance of truthful advertising. He said, “Truthful advertising is not only the right thing to do, but also great for the business.” Key findings: • Growth in the Indian advertising market slowed down to 12.5 per cent in 2016, thanks to the tsunami that hit in the form of demonetisation. Demonetisation knocked off Rs. 1,650 crore from ADEX in November and December 2016. Growth in 2015 over 2014 was as high as 17.6 per cent. • The ADEX growth in the first half of the year was slow at 13 per cent, but accelerated to 16 per cent by October 2016, before 'de-growing' in November and December 2016 by eight per cent. • Growth came mainly on the back of  Digital, which grew by 40 per cent plus, and now stands at Rs. 7,315 crore, 15 per cent of the market. •  Growth in traditional media (all media other than digital), slowed down to 8.5 per cent. • he dominant category continues to be FMCG contributing 32per cent, followed by Auto at 10 per cent and Telecom 8 per cent. E-Commerce that had taken ADEX (only TV + Print + Radio) by storm in 2015, contributed only 4 per cent in 2016. • TV grew by 9 per cent and print only by 7 per cent in 2016. • Radio stood out with a growth rate of 13.2per cent although on a small base. • Nearly 50 per cent of Print’s growth of Rs. 1,216 crore is accounted by only four categories FMCG, Auto, Education and BFSI. Nearly 44 per cent of TV growth of Rs. 1,570 crore is accounted by FMCG. • Advertising continues to be a Big Boys’ game with the largest spender HUL spending approximately Rs. 2,500 crore and top 10 spenders accounting for 16 per cent of the total market and contributing 45 per cent of the top 50 list. • Unilever, Amazon and Procter & Gamble continue to be the top three advertisers. • Many new entrants entered the Elite top 50 list like Patanjali, OPPO Mobiles, Nissan Motors, Reliance JIO, Vivo Phone, SBI and Videocon. Says Madison World chairman Sam Balsara, “Our expectation is that the market will grow 13.5 per cent in 2017, but growth rates will vary widely from month to month.We expect the market to grow by just 8 per cent for the period January to April 2017, 14 per cent from May to October 2017 and 24 per cent in November and December 2017, given that market had 'de-grown' by 8 per cent in November and December 2016. Our optimism for good growth in ADEX starting May comes on the back of several govt initiatives- from high government investment in infrastructure, lower corporate and personal taxes for small and medium companies and the masses, good government support for the poor and consequently the wide scale expectation of yet another year of high GDP growth.” In the current environment, Madison advises: 1. Take Advantage of weaker January-April months and intensify campaigns to get good Impact during this period. 2. Use Digital, but less for top of Funnel Awareness and more for Mid/Bottom Funnel Consideration, Leads and Advocacy. 3. Don’t become a slave to Media Ratings / Readership Data. Ride it and use it as a Guide, Not as a Crutch. • The original forecast for February 2016 was 16.8 per cent which was brought down to 13.2 per cent in August 2016. The projection now for 2017 is 13.5 per cent. tags TV adsCrompton GreavesAdExShantanu Khosla Trending Drink clean water, urges Moonbow Zee TV's Zulfia Waris to join Discovery Network Net Neutrality ideas date open till 28 Feb Romedy Now launches #FurrentinesDay film, garners 1.5 mn views Pankaj Pachauri's Go News unveils logo   Latest Reads Alpenliebe TVC portrays small moments of joy in everyday life Alpenliebe Gold, the flagship candy brand of Perfetti Van Melle India, has launched a heart-warming new communication campaign - chhoti chhoti khushiyon ke liye.

Business U.S. Chamber of Commerce Hosts Nigerian Trade Minister as Both Agree to Work Together By Press Release - February 16, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter United States of America, February 15, 2017/ — The U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s U.S.-Africa Business Center Tuesday hosted the Nigerian Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment Dr. Okechukwu Enelamah (www.FMITI.gov.ng) for a roundtable discussion with U.S. business executives at their office in Washington, D.C. The conversation focused on enhancing trade and investment relationship between both countries. This comes in the context of a telephone call between President Muhammadu Buhari and President Donald Trump Monday, where both Presidents discussed security and economic issues. It is seen as suggesting the U.S. consideration of Nigeria as a strategic partner. “The U.S. has historically been one of Nigeria’s top trading partners; it was the biggest importer of Nigeria’s crude oil at some point. In the last five years, however, the sharp decline in U.S. imports of our crude, on account of rising domestic production of shale, has altered the trade balance between our two countries. This development presents Nigeria with a good opportunity for diversification and to explore and increase non-oil export – especially in agricultural products, services and the digital economy,” said Minister Enelamah. On his part, the President of the U.S.-Africa Business Center and Vice President for African Affairs at the Chamber Scott Eisner, stated that “With the largest economy in Africa, Nigeria is an important partner for U.S. businesses. Our conversation highlighted the work being done to strengthen the economic relationship between our two countries and how we can continue to build on this relationship.” Enelamah also participated in a Facebook Live conversation with the U.S.-Africa Business Center following the roundtable. Some of the companies that attended the gathering include Google, Microsoft, Blackstone, Procter and Gamble, UPS, Johnson and Johnson, Boston Scientific, Philip Morris International, Lekoil Oil, ITIC, etc. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the world’s largest business federation representing the interests of more than 3 million businesses of all sizes, sectors, and regions, as well as state and local chambers and industry associations. Its International Affairs division includes more than 70 regional and policy experts and 25 country-and region-specific business councils and initiatives. The U.S. Chamber also works closely with 117 American Chambers of Commerce abroad. The U.S.-Africa Business Center is the preeminent voice in the global business community advocating for increased trade between the United States and Africa. After the roundtable, the Minister went on to attend events focusing on the Ease of Doing Business and Investment at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and the Hudson Institute. He answered questions from a mixed audience of business executives, government officials, diplomats and others. He similarly had meetings at the State Department with the outgoing Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Linda Thomas Greenfield and U.S. Trade Representatives for Africa at the Commerce office. Issues on the agenda at the state department ranged from the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), SMEs, Nigeria’s leadership on the Continent and continued engagement with the new administration, while the commerce office focused on trade and the WTO. Minister Enelamah was accompanied by his Trade Adviser and Chief Negotiator Ambassador Chiedu Osakwe, Special Adviser Bunmi Adeoye and Strategic Communications Adviser, Constance C. Ikokwu.

Ask any business owner a few months after they have completed their strategy, what is the biggest problem they face. You will get exactly the same answer from both. The strategy is not being executed. According to Professor Richard Rumelt of UCLA, there are only two types of strategy, “good strategy and bad strategy.” (He is the author of a book by the same name, reviewed in this column in 2012.) The strategy method described at the beginning of this book would fall into Rumelt’s definition of bad strategy, and I wouldn’t read this book for Part I. That said, it is a valuable guide on how to ensure your strategy is executed. The execution comes from your leader’s ability to integrate the strategy into their leadership method. Many good leaders I have met have never considered this issue, and many senior managers have never thought about what it would take to do so. Authors Harbir Singh and Michael Useem of Wharton Business School have formulated this process into six steps. The first step is the realisation of the connection between leadership and strategy. As a guest at a barbecue one weekend, I was asked what I did for a living. I replied that I am a strategist, to which one of the guests responded that his firm had recently gone through just such a process. I asked him how it was going and he replied: “We are so busy with our regular work, we simply haven’t had the time to even think about the strategy.” One has to wonder what the regular work could possibly be, except trying to execute the strategy! That is the beginning of Singh and Useem’s prescription for strategic leadership: integrating strategy and leadership. Strategic leadership is being clear what the strategy is so you can make choices of where to play and how to win, how to prioritise goals, and to ensure you have the human capabilities necessary to achieve these goals. “Integrating the two areas calls for a continuous and simultaneous discussion of both strategy and leadership questions,” the authors exhort. The key word here is “continuous”: the discussion of leadership and strategy at every opportunity. The continuous discussions are around the positions of the organisation to meet the strategy, and whether you still have the right people and architecture in place. Strategy must be taught The second step on the strategy leader’s roadmap is the acknowledgement that neither strategy nor leadership is a natural skill set; it must be taught. Academic research, borne out by management practice, has identified several ways this type of development can be achieved. Possibly the most effective is a combination of formal learning, one-on-one coaching and exposure to instructive experience. These experiences are chosen for the opportunity they offer to force the candidate to apply the learning and coaching if he or she is to succeed. Formal learning, one-on-one coaching and exposure to instructive experience is a powerful combination. This approach has been behind the success of General Electric, Boeing, American Express, IBM, and Procter & Gamble. And it doesn’t require deep pockets, only determination from senior leadership and the board. The third step to ensuring the strategy is executed is by identifying the strategic fit between the current managers and the particular challenges the incumbent will face. The executive must have the temperament and relevant experience that aligns with the specific imperatives of the firm at the moment. If they don’t, then the second step, development, as described above becomes necessary and if that fails, another leader must be sought. This process entails pinpointing the priority skills the leader requires through careful and detailed analysis, not coffee table discussion. The fourth step is to convey the strategic intent (or what I call your ‘functional strategy’) – how you have to function to achieve the strategic outcomes in a dynamic and fast-changing business environment. “Managers at all levels must also be able to convey strategic intent if they are to effectively exercise strategic leadership”, the authors explain. The fifth step is to see leadership in layers. Once the most senior leaders have absorbed the strategy, it is up to them to cascade it down to the next level with such clarity that this level can do the same to the level below, and onward. The last step is to “decide deliberatively”, that is to use the strategy to guide each and every decision, under all circumstances, and every time. No exceptions. These six steps will ensure that your strategy is executed. They will ensure your expenditure of time, effort and money in your strategy yields a strong return. That does however presuppose your strategy is a good one.

Updated 6 hours ago Wall Street pushed further into record-high territory Wednesday, with the S&P 500 notching a seven-session winning streak, helped by a round of robust economic data and ongoing optimism that President Trump will cut corporate taxes. Bigger-than-expected rises in retail sales and consumer prices in January reinforced confidence that the economy is growing at a solid pace following the strongest quarterly corporate earnings growth in over two years. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 11.67 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,349.25. It's the seventh straight gain for the index and its longest winning streak in three and a half years. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 107.45 points, or 0.5 percent, to 20,611.86. The Nasdaq composite rose 36.87, or 0.6 percent, to 5,819.44. Seven stocks rose on the New York Stock Exchange for every five that fell. In a meeting with top executives from retail companies, Trump said he would lower taxes substantially and simplify the tax code, echoing a vow he made last week and on the campaign trail. The president has provided scant details about his own tax overhaul, but said people will “love” his planned tax reforms. He assured retail CEOs that tax rates would be lowered and simplified in a “massive” plan that “will be submitted in the not too distant future.” Optimism that lower taxes and corporate deregulation will expand the economy pushed the three major indexes to all-time highs. The S&P 500 recorded its fifth straight record close and its longest non-stop winning streak since September 2013, even as some investors worried that Trump so far has provided no substantial details of his tax plan. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, stood by the stance she took on Tuesday that the U.S. central bank was on track to raise interest rates at an upcoming policy meeting. “A year ago, if Janet Yellen had come out with the statement she made, the market would have freaked out because the fundamentals were very soft,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. “Now, if the Fed raises rates, it's not going to shake the world because people are confident enough about the fundamentals.” The health care index was the top gainer, up 1.17 percent. Financial stocks, which benefit from higher rates, rose 0.74 percent. The utilities and real estate sectors, both of which do worse in high-rate environments, fell 0.39 percent and 0.30 percent respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.52 percent to end at 20,611.86. The S&P 500 gained 0.50 percent to 2,349.25 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.64 percent to 5,819.44. Fourth-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies have risen about 7.2 percent, the strongest expansion since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts on average expect S&P 500 earnings for the first quarter to rise 10.7 percent. Procter & Gamble jumped 3.71 percent to a two-year high, giving the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P, after Trian Fund disclosed a stake, which could pressure the company to slice costs and slow-growing divisions. Shares of Southwest, United Continental, American Airlines and Delta rose between 2 percent and 4 percent after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported investments topping $2.1 billion in each of the carriers. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.44-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.79-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 80 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 156 new highs and 27 new lows. About 7.0 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the daily average of 6.8 billion over the last 20 sessions.

(AP Photo/Bikas Das) Share Written by Madhura Karnik 5 hours ago Quartz india India Inc is currently in the midst of an earnings season with firms announcing results of their financial performance for the October-December 2016 quarter. And while every season sees the management explaining profits and losses to shareholders and investors in different ways, this time around everyone has the same story: demonetisation was bad for business. Prime minister Narendra Modi’s Nov. 08, 2016, decision removed some 86% of currency in circulation (by value) in India. The ensuing cash crunch forced consumers in Asia’s third-largest economy to curb discretionary spending, making it tough for firms to manage liquidity, and thus slowed industrial growth. Here’s how executives from fast-moving consumer goods firms to power and infrastructure companies highlighted the impact of demonetisation over the last few months: “During the quarter, commercial vehicle segments of the company witnessed demand shrinkage due to the demonetisation—M&HCV (medium and heavy commercial vehicles) segment witnessed major pressure with a fall of 9% year-on-year and LCV (light commercial vehicles) segment was overall flat.” Tata Motors (pdf) “(The) government’s initiatives to curb the parallel economy and make a transition to (a) cashless economy have caused disruption whose impact on the business sentiment is yet to be conclusively assessed.” Larsen & Toubro “Demonetisation effectively drained liquidity. I don’t think that’s about price elasticity, I think that’s about the current shock to the circulation and liquidity.” James Quincey, Coca Cola CEO designate “If you look at Q2 second quarter results, the growth was higher than 10%, so you can safely assume that 1% to 2% growth we lost on account of demonetisation.” Nitin Sood, CFO, PVR (pdf) “The positive market growth momentum witnessed in the second quarter, aided by good monsoon and flow through of 7th Pay Commission benefits, was impacted with implementation of demonetisation in November 2016.” Varun Berry, managing director, Brittania “In India, demonetisation cost us a swing from strong growth through Q3 to a decline in Q4 .” Ian Cook, global CEO, Colgate-Palmolive “There has been a temporary adverse impact of the demonetisation leading to growth deceleration in India where we posted just 3% net sales growth.” Alexandre Ricard, chairman and CEO, Pernod Ricard “Demonetisation, however, did halt growth temporarily during the December quarter.” Sanjiv Mehta, managing director and CEO, Hindustan Unilever “(In) India, demonetisation, the elimination of Rs500 and Rs1,000 bank notes, that accounted for over 80% of that country’s currency in a cash-dominated economy, was an unexpected headwind.” Jon Moeller, CFO, Procter & Gamble “Demonetisation has affected the retail part of the business; and to some extent, in November-December, secondary and tertiary sales have also been slower mainly because of the same.” Gautam Seth, joint managing director, HPL Electric and Power “The estimated impact of demonetisation adversely impacted performance by a further 5% from our pharmaceutical product portfolio, which is predominantly within our adult care, as well as from our consumer brands.” A Vaidheesh, managing director, GlaxoSmithKline (pdf) “…Due to demonetisation impact the growth anticipated for the current year will not happen, but the long-term impact will definitely be good.” Prakash P Chhabria, executive chairman, Finolex (pdf) “…Demonetisation had a significant impact on our India business in Q4. And there’s still some lingering effects. I’m not sure we are totally out of the woods.” Indra K Nooyi, chairperson and CEO, PepsiCo Inc.

Melton and the Buckeyes competed against the Michigan Wolverines at the St. John Arena on Feb. 4. Credit: Aaron Tomich | For The Lantern Four Buckeyes will compete in the 2017 Winter Cup, including former gymnast and current director of operations Drew Moling, redshirt junior Sean Melton, sophomore Alec Yoder and future Buckeye and high-school senior Max Andryushchenko. The competition will take place on Thursday with finals on Saturday in the Westgate Las Vegas Resort and Casino. The scheduled times of the Winter Cup vary per athlete. Andryushchenko will compete at 4 p.m. ET while Melton, Yoder and Moling compete at 9:30 p.m. ET on Thursday. Finals will take place on Saturday at 10:15 p.m. ET. Performances at the Winter Cup will determine which 15 athletes, country-wide, will join the U.S. Men’s Senior National Team. Following the two-day competition, the top-four ranked all-around athletes will automatically qualify. The Men’s Program Committee selects up to 11 more gymnasts participating in the Winter Cup and members of the 2016 US Olympic team, including alternates, to keep their spot on the national team provided they earn qualifying national scores both days of the competition. After the 2016 Winter Cup, Melton was placed in U.S. Senior National Team following his third-place performance in all-around. Melton posted an overall score of 174.500, finishing behind three-time U.S. all-around champion Sam Mikulak (177.450) and 2015 NCAA all-around champion Akash Modi (175.300) from Stanford. Although he is still recovering from a wrist injury sustained during the 2016 preseason, Melton has not backed down and is ready to hit the floor again. “I’m going out there and showing all the USA committee that I’m back and I’m recovering. I’m not 100 percent back, but I’m getting there and I’ve improved on events that I’m doing,” Melton said. “I’m in good shape, and they could use me on Team USA to compete and help represent our country. I’m just excited to show what I’ve been working on since trial — and that I never gave up.” Yoder finished ninth overall in the 2016 Winter Cup, with a score of 170.700. He was placed in the all-around top-10 at the competition in the past two seasons — an eighth-place performance in 2015 placed him on the U.S. Senior National Team. “I’m looking forward to just getting out there again and competing,” Yoder said. “That’s why I do this sport. I do it because it’s fun and I do it because it’s what I love.” Moling, the current director of operations for the team, was 23rd overall with a combined all-around total of 162.750. Moling finished 16th on both rings (28.550) and high bar (27.850) at the 2016 Winter Cup. “After this meet, I’ll be done as this is the last one of my career,” Moling said. “I competed at this competition last year … and I did pretty well here; it qualified me to compete at the P&G Championship which is in the summer. Since I competed at the P&G, that pre-qualified me to compete at the Winter Cup this week. I figured I might as well come out and have one last competition.” According to the all-around placements and Men’s Program Committee’s points ranking system, the top 42 gymnasts will advance to the final competition along with the top-three gymnasts of each event. The all-around and individual event champions will be determined by their combined two-day score. OSU enters the week ranked No. 3 in the College Gymnastics Association (CGA) National Rankings, with the No. 3 average all-around score in the nation and a No. 1 ranking on pommel horse with an average score of 69.575.

Optimism that lower taxes and corporate deregulation will expand the economy pushed the three major indexes to all-time highs. The S&P 500 recorded its fifth straight record close and its longest non-stop winning streak since September 2013, even as some investors worried that Trump so far has provided no substantial details of his tax plan. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, in a testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, stood by the stance she took on Tuesday that the US central bank was on track to raise interest rates at an upcoming policy meeting. “A year ago, if Janet Yellen had come out with the statement she made, the market would have freaked out because the fundamentals were very soft,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. “Now, if the Fed raises rates it's not going to shake the world because people are confident enough about the fundamentals.” The healthcare index was the top gainer, up 1.17 per cent. Financial stocks, which benefit from higher rates, rose 0.74 per cent. The utilities and real estate sectors, both of which do worse in high-rate environments, fell 0.39 percent and 0.30 percent respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.52 per cent to end at 20,611.86. The S&P 500 gained 0.50 per cent to 2,349.25 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.64 per cent to 5,819.44. Fourth-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies have risen about 7.2 per cent, the strongest expansion since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts on average expect S&P 500 earnings for the first quarter to rise 10.7 per cent. Procter & Gamble jumped 3.71 per cent to a two-year high, giving the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P, after Trian Fund disclosed a stake, which could pressure the company to slice costs and slow-growing divisions. Shares of Southwest, United Continental, American Airlines and Delta rose between 2 per cent and 4 per cent after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported investments topping $2.1 billion in each of the carriers. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.44-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.79-to-1 ratio favoured advancers. The S&P 500 posted 80 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 156 new highs and 27 new lows. About 7.0 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges, above the daily average of 6.8 billion over the last 20 sessions.

For the fifth straight day, the three major US equity indices ended at all-time highs, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 0.5 percent to 20,611.86. The S&P 500 gained 0.50 percent to 2,349.25 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.64 percent to 5,819.44.

Korean regime’s weapon of choice, says defector Man United will give Europa tilt full focus, says Mourinho France to decide outcome of Fillon fake work case today Advertisement More stories                Tools Increase Text Decrease Text Reset Text Print Article A street sign for Wall Street hangs in front of the New York Stock Exchange, May 8, 2013.NEW YORK, Feb 16 — Wall Street stocks pushed to fresh highs for the fifth day in a row yesterday, giving a boost to most international equity markets on continued optimism about US economic prospects. US stocks have been on a tear since last week when President Donald Trump vowed to release details of his promised tax cut plan within two to three weeks. Yesterday, Trump reiterated that he would soon release specifics on the plan. Sentiment was further lifted by a hopeful outlook from US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and solid US data on retail sales and consumer spending. All of these things lended confidence to the view that the Fed would soon raise interest rates, a positive for financial stocks. Besides New York, equity markets rose in London, Frankfurt, Paris and Tokyo, which gained 1.0 per cent. Market “bullishness stems from hawkish testimony by Janet Yellen... giving a fillip to a key financial sector whose profitability benefits from higher interest rates”, said Accendo Markets analyst Mike van Dulken. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich said, “It feels like investors might get the pro-growth part of the platform.” He added that mounting questions about Trump’s connections to Russia so far are not rattling investors. Among individual stocks Procter & Gamble jumped 3.7 per cent on news that activist investor Trian Fund Management led by Nelson Peltz holds 6.4 million shares worth US$575 million (RM2.5 billion) in the consumer products giant, according to a securities filing. Some news reports said Trian has added to the stake since the filing deadline and now holds more than US$3 billion in shares. Trian is known for pushing companies to reorganize businesses and return funds to shareholders. Shares in troubled conglomerate Toshiba plunged almost nine per cent — extending Tuesday’s eight per cent decline — after warning it faced a 390 billion yen (US$3.4 billion) loss in the fiscal year to March, hit by a 700 billion yen writedown at its US nuclear unit Westinghouse. The news prompted its chairman to resign while it also hinted at another accounting scandal following a profit-padding crisis in 2015.

Soros Fund Management, as the name suggests, manages the personal fortune of controversial billionaire George Soros. Their 13-F form detailing their purchases and sales in Q4 2016 was recently released. Goldman Sachs and other financial companies enjoyed large amounts of investment after Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election. Trump's promises of deregulation and tax cuts made the financial sector a safe bet for investors. Soros, who has spent hundreds of millions of his own money for liberal causes and is a vocal critic of President Trump, saw his stock portfolio briefly devalued by $1 billion after the election. © AP Photo/ Manuel Balce Ceneta Soros Teams Up With Attorneys Challenging Trump Immigration Order In addition to Goldman Sachs, Soros bought tens of millions of shares in companies such as Facebook, Time Warner, T Mobile, and Kohls. Soros also totally eliminated his stake in Barrick Gold as the gold market contracted in late 2016. Other companies that he sold major shares from include Intel, Wisdomtree, and Procter & Gamble. Soros's largest stock remains in Liberty Broadband, making up 14% of their portfolio. However, that was reduced by 6% since Q3 2016. Steven Mnuchin, former Executive Vice President of Goldman Sachs, was confirmed to the Senate as President Trump's Treasury Secretary on Tuesday. Mnuchin also was a member of an investment group alongside Soros in the mid-2000's. ...

And, chump change for Soros. Huge...gimme a brake. Reply Athanasios 08:35 16.02.2017 | 0 | Edit | Delete This is a useful article, although the amount of shares Soros bought is not the real news. The news is Mnuchin, whose connection to Goldman is not just an employer-emloyee relationship. The roots go deeper, and they are scary, but you have to look this up on your own. Regarding Trump, Mnuchin managed to get much of the election financing for Trump, on the condition that he would get the post of the Treasury if Trump became president. Without that financing (which was several times smaller than the financing Clinton received) Trump would not have been able to make it. But the real issue is what Trum will do for his country. Judging from his decisions so far, I am impressed.Show new comments (0) Сomment Reply in reply to(Show commentHide comment) | | Edit | Delete Save Thank you!

Bigger-than-expected rises in retail sales and consumer prices in January reinforced confidence that the economy is growing at a solid pace following the strongest quarterly corporate earnings growth in over two years. US economy leaps higher, setting stage for Fed raising rates In a meeting with top executives from US retail companies, Trump said he would lower taxes substantially and simplify the tax code, echoing a vow he made last week and on the campaign trail. Optimism that lower taxes and corporate deregulation will expand the economy pushed the three major indexes to all-time highs. The S&P 500 recorded its fifth straight record close and its longest non-stop winning streak since September 2013, even as some investors worried that Trump so far has provided no substantial details of his tax plan. Great listening session with CEO's of the Retail Industry Leaders Association this morning! pic.twitter.com/sy6xJcWfcF — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017 Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, stood by the stance she took on Tuesday that the US central bank was on track to raise interest rates at an upcoming policy meeting. “A year ago, if Janet Yellen had come out with the statement she made, the market would have freaked out because the fundamentals were very soft,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. “Now, if the Fed raises rates it’s not going to shake the world because people are confident enough about the fundamentals.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.52 per cent to end at 20,611.86. The S&P 500 gained 0.50 per cent to 2,349.25 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.64 per cent to 5,819.44. Fourth-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies have risen about 7.2 per cent, the strongest expansion since the third quarter of 2014. Analysts on average expect S&P 500 earnings for the first quarter to rise 10.7 per cent. The health care index was the top gainer, up 1.17 per cent. Financial stocks, which benefit from higher rates, rose 0.74 per cent. The utilities and real estate sectors, both of which do worse in high-rate environments, fell 0.39 per cent and 0.30 per cent respectively. Procter & Gamble jumped 3.71 per cent to a two-year high, giving the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P, after Trian Fund disclosed a stake, which could pressure the company to slice costs and slow-growing divisions. Shares of Southwest, United Continental, American Airlines and Delta rose between 2 and 4 per cent after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reported investments topping US$2.1 billion in each of the carriers.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Hong Kong land parcels worth over HK$30bn set for tender 2 Is missing tycoon Xiao Jianhua losing control of his business empire? 3 China’s obsession with skyscrapers reaches new heights 4 Why would Malaysia sell its ‘symbol of dignity’ to China? 5 HTC scales back production amid cash flow problems Shared 1 HTC scales back production amid cash flow problems 2 China’s obsession with skyscrapers reaches new heights 3 Why would Malaysia sell its ‘symbol of dignity’ to China? 4 Is missing tycoon Xiao Jianhua losing control of his business empire? 5 Key stocks tied to missing billionaire hit by 4.3bn yuan sell-off Commented 1 Abe’s dangerous path of cosying up to the US 2 Lies, half-truths and mistrust dominate Trump White House 3 ‘Long Hair’ has opened up a can of worms 4 With travel ban, America has shot itself in the foot 5 Era of exploiting ‘regulatory gaps’ coming to an end       You may also like Politics Why Malaysia is fighting Singapore over a rock 11 Feb 2017 - 12:21pm 5 Intelligent cars to make world safer In partnership with: HKT PREMIER Hong Kong Dwindling support for bitcoin businesses in Hong Kong 11 Feb 2017 - 10:55pm 2 We can make a difference Sponsored by: Hong Kong International School Opinion Trump’s assault on Muslims takes US back to 1882 11 Feb 2017 - 11:31am 36 World CIA files reveal how US used psychics to spy on Iran 11 Feb 2017 - 9:27pm 3 Post Magazine Hong Kong men victims of sextortion by Philippine cybercriminals 11 Feb 2017 - 9:31am 14 Geopolitics Revealed: Malaysia’s ‘new evidence’ in island row against Singapore 11 Feb 2017 - 2:19am 16 Hong Kong John Tsang builds big poll lead over Carrie Lam in leadership race 10 Feb 2017 - 10:28am 35 China China to store foreigners’ fingerprints upon entry, starting with Shenzhen 10 Feb 2017 - 8:25am 27 China Fire at Chinese factory that supplied Samsung Note 7 batteries 9 Feb 2017 - 10:25am 8 China Does China’s Communist Party follow any succession rules at all? 7 Feb 2017 - 9:21pm 10 South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

I think taht being said, we're stil llikely to see a cautious Fed when it comes to tightening monetary policy. And we still believe that the next rate hike will be in June."
