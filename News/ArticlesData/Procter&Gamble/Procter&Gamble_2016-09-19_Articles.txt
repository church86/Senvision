Tyler Crowe (TMFDirtyBird) Sep 19, 2016 at 12:04PM Image source: Getty Images. Can we still call it a "hot take" when some financial pundit takes a swipe at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for its massive stock buyback program? If you follow any financial talking heads on Twitter, you may have noticed that any percentage-point dip is a chance for them to say something about the tech giant's wasting shareholder capital or not being able to time the market.  For all the criticism that Apple gets flung its way for buying back loads of shares, at least those buybacks are doing what they are designed to do: lower share count. The same can't be said for every company with multibillion-dollar stock buyback programs. Some of the biggest and most profitable companies in America have spent tens of billions of dollars over the years on share repurchases, but they have little to show for it. Not all share repurchase programs are created equal Apple's share buyback program is actually a fairly recent development in the context of the company's entire lifespan. The buyback program started in earnest in 2012. Since then, the company has spent $127 billion on share repurchases. As a result, it has reduced its total shares outstanding by 17.5%. When you consider that the overall market cap of Apple is a staggering $639 billion, the amount spent on share repurchases and what it has netted isn't that bad, especially when you compare it to other stock repurchase programs, like Procter & Gamble's (NYSE:PG)  Over the past 20 years, Procter & Gamble has spent $96 billion on its share repurchase programs. When you consider that the amount is a significant portion of the company's $230 billion market capitalization, you would think that $96 billion would buy a decent amount of shares over such a long time horizon. During that time, though, the company's share count has decreased by less than 4%. The biggest difference between the efficacy of Apple's and Procter & Gamble's stock repurchase programs has a lot to do with their stock compensation programs. In the time that Apple has deployed that $127 billion on share repurchases, it has issued about $2 billion worth of stock for employee stock options. Procter & Gamble, on the other hand, has issued more than $20 billion worth of exercised stock options during that time, as well as another $6 billion in stock-based compensation. Keep in mind, too, that exercised stock options on a cash flow statement do not account for the full value of that stock, so the total share impact of those options is much greater than what the company's cash flows indicate. It's pretty safe to say that, to an individual investor in Procter & Gamble, the $96 billion in share repurchases has not been of a huge benefit. Much of that benefit has been taken back by stock-based compensation to the company's employees. I don't mean to suggest Procter & Gamble is the sole company spending large amounts on stock compensation relative to the amount spent on share repurchases, because it is much more common than you might think. Here is a list of companies that have spent staggering amounts of money on share repurchase programs in relation to their market caps, but at the same time have issued large sums of shares through exercising stock options that have led to rather paltry share-count reductions. Company Market Cap Total Spent on Share Repurchases 1996-2016 Total Cash Received for Exercised Stock Options (1996-2016) Total Share-Count Change Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) $320,300 $76,792 $20,785 3.1%  Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) $161,900  $79,644  $17,366  (28%) Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) $153,200  $99,661 $34,116  (14%)  The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) $177,900  $44,294  $29,434 (13%) Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) $222,500  $67,304 $57,499  64% Data source: S&P Global Market Intelligence. All results in millions. Another thing I should also be clear about is that issuing stock options isn't the only reason for tepid share-count reductions or, in some cases, increases. Many of these companies have used their own stock as currency in major acquisitions, such as Procter & Gamble's $54 billion deal for Gillette in 2005, Cisco's $6.9 billion deal for Cerent in 1999, and Wells Fargo's $15 billion purchase of Wachovia in 2008. Overall, though, larger chunks of these companies' buyback programs have been eaten up by issuing of stock options compared to what Apple has done over the past four years. What a Fool believes This isn't to say that any of the companies that have spent billions on share repurchase programs with little in share-count reduction to show for it are bad investments. On the contrary, over a 20-year time frame, all of the companies listed here, with the exception of Coca-Cola, have outpaced the S&P 500 on a total-return basis. So clearly these companies are doing something right, and the impact of their share repurchases and issuances on performance has been marginal. PG Total Return Price data by YCharts. The bigger message here is that the critics who give Apple flack for its buyback program overlook those companies with buyback programs that have had little effect over the long term. So far, Apple is onto something with its share buyback program. As long as it doesn't fall into the trap of shelling out generously on stock option programs that erode share-count reductions, then long-term investors won't be complaining much about the company's buying back stock.

P&G shrinks factory footprint Alexander Coolidge , acoolidge@enquirer.com 5:57 p.m. EDT September 20, 2016 Buy Photo Procter & Gamble's headquarters in downtown Cincinnati. (Photo: The Enquirer/Cara Owsley)Buy Photo Procter & Gamble’s worldwide manufacturing footprint is set to shrink to the smallest it has been in more than 20 years. The Cincinnati-based company has sold or closed 17 factories around the world – including 12 in the United States – in the last five years. Next month,  eight more P&G plants will become the property of a company that makes Rimmel makeup and Calvin Klein perfume. P&G executives have assured investors the Coty Inc. deal will wrap up its two-year-long brand-selling campaign. But the company appears poised to shutter even more factories. The shift is part of an ongoing drive to improve efficiency and lower costs. Ultimately, it means P&G's signature products, such as Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, will be made in fewer, but larger manufacturing plants. Procter & Gamble CEO David Taylor  (Photo: Provided) The company has promised Wall Street another $10 billion in savings over the next half decade and has indicated a major piece will come from slimmed-down operations. CEO David Taylor said the cuts could be achieved without a “broad-based (jobs) reduction.” But to execute the plan, P&G is moving production to plants it is expanding with the intention of closing down others. P&G's manufacturing overhaul has coincided with cutting 24,000 jobs worldwide through buyouts, divestitures, layoffs and attrition. Though P&G is hiring factory workers at some sites, nearly 10,000 of the jobs eliminated in the last five years were from its manufacturing network. “Supply chain transformation is in its early stages," Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller told analysts at a conference earlier this month. Right now, P&G is focusing on North America, before shifting in order to Europe, Latin America and finally India, the Middle East and Africa, he said. In the United States, P&G closed factories earlier this year in Augusta, Georgia and Cayey, Puerto Rico; this summer, it announced a chemicals factory in Avenel, New Jersey would close in 2018 and be sold. The company owns three other chemical plants in North America, which are located in suburban Chicago; Sacramento, California; and the Ivorydale campus in St. Bernard. More closures could be announced as P&G prepares next year to open a West Virginia factory that is currently under construction. P&G is spending $500 million on the new facility in Berkeley County, located in the state's eastern panhandle. "P&G is really looking to maximize their efficiency with significant up-front investments in factories, but that means the closure of less-efficient plants in time," said Leon Loewenstine, chief investment strategist at Downtown-based Riverpoint Capital Management. Besides the pending Coty deal, P&G has shed factories through its sale of the Iams pet food and Duracell battery brands. Buy Photo  (Photo: Enquirer file) P&G bulks up some plants, cuts others and uses robots The company is spending a half-billion dollars to build a large factory in West Virginia's Eastern Panhandle and investing millions in expanding other plants. P&G officials say the plant that’s as large as the Kenwood Towne Centre will make Pantene shampoo, Olay body wash and Bounce fabric enhancers as the company emphasizes facilities that can produce a variety of products for different business units. In Utah, P&G officials have said it is spending $500 million to double the size of its paper plant there and add 200 new jobs, but have not disclosed what other products will be made by the super-sized plant. "We're constructing multi-category manufacturing sites in geographically strategic locations to replace smaller single-category sites," Moeller told analysts this month at the Barclays Back-to-School Consumer Conference. Moeller added P&G is also P&G is automating production at the plants it is keeping to lower labor costs. He said the company is "aggressively expanding the application" of "collaborative robots" that now pack cases of product and wrap pallets for shipment. The company is also testing automated (self-driving) fork lifts. Michael Magazine, a professer of operations and business analytics at the University of Cincinnati, said it's cheaper for a manufacturer to operate larger but fewer factories. It saves money on labor, equipment, utilities, supplies, maintenance and financing. If a company chooses to run fewer plants, one critical issue is to create the capability to make all different products necessary, Magazine said. Another trick, is the right location: close to suppliers that provide necessary raw materials and close to customers who buy the end product. "If you have more plants, you can move closer to your customers and you can be more specialized," Magazine said. "But if you can be flexible and switch production to produce different products, you don't need as many factories and you can save money." P&G has signaled some of its North American factories will not only survive, but grow. The company’s fabric care plant in Lima, about 130 miles north of P&G's headquarters, has already been expanded and the company said the Avenel operations will be consolidated there. Similarly, P&G’s Greensboro, North Carolina plant has picked up work from the now-shuttered beauty brand factory in Puerto Rico. Moeller added that while P&G is spending a lot of money on factories now, savings will come. "We're in investment mode now with savings to ramp up in two, three and four years," Moeller said. The investment in added production North American capabilities comes as P&G has amassed an eye-popping $13.3 billion of cash and securities on its balance sheet, yet its U.S. sales are relatively flat at $27 billion. P&G officials acknowledged the company’s ongoing review of its supply chain but declined to discuss specific potential factory closings for this story. Buy Photo  (Photo: Enquirer file) Company has virtually no manufacturing locally Cincinnati has seen this before. At the start of the millennium, Procter was in crisis. Sales growth was stalled, the stock had plummeted, CEO Durk Jager was ousted and investors were unhappy. Jager’s successor, A.G. Lafley, turned the company around through the sales of slow-selling brands and cost-cutting, then investing the proceeds into faster-growing core operations. As part of this round of brand sales and cost-cutting, Lafley all but completely dismantled P&G’s ownership of its iconic Ivorydale manufacturing complex. The local Crisco plant became part of J.M. Smucker in the 2002 spin-off of the shortening brand; investment group Twin Rivers Technologies bought the Olestra fat substitute operations in 2002; and in 2003, the soap-making operation was sold to a Canadian manufacturer, Trillium Personal Care, which took over Ivory and Safeguard production on a contract basis. Those deals left P&G with ownership of just a small chemical factory at Ivorydale – once the company’s largest complex. The local operation makes glycerin and employs 90 manufacturing workers.

The British-Dutch company announced Monday that it bought Seventh Generation, an eco-friendly cleaning, paper, and personal care product company, for $700 million. The acquisition show the increasing importance of ethics to the consumer market and represents a shift in values toward sustainability for Unilever. “Seventh Generation has long been a disruptor in the US marketplace, leading the industry in sustainable innovation while attracting new generations of conscious consumers,” Nitin Paranjpe, president of Unilever’s home care division, said in a statement. “This addition to Unilever’s product portfolio will help us meet rising demand for high-quality products with a purpose.” Recommended:Earth Day: Are you saving the planet or just showing off? Take our quiz. The sale could give Unilever, valued at $136.2 billion, an advantage in a US market largely held by its rival company Procter & Gamble.

Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/18 “We look at this as having a multiplier effect for our business,” Seventh Generation Chief Executive John Replogle, who will stay on to run the company, told The Wall Street Journal. “We always aspired to be a billion-dollar brand. We see this as a springboard as opposed to throwing in the towel.” Some are worried about the partnership, as startups don’t always retain their original mission once bought by publicly traded companies. But Unilever has historically taken a hands-off approach when it has acquired new companies – like it was seen to do after it bought Ben & Jerry’s in 2000. Additionally, Unilever acquired the environmentally friendly Dollar Shave Club in July for $1 billion, and is reported to be in talks to buy Jessica Alba’s Honest Company, which sells nontoxic household products. The acquisition of companies aimed at environmentally conscious buyers symbolizes a dramatic turnaround for Unilever, which in 2008 was accused of contributing to the destruction of the Borneo Rainforest in Indonesia by buying palm oil, a key ingredient in many processed food and personal care products, from companies that engaged in illegal deforestation. At the time, Unilever was the largest purchaser of palm oil in the world.  The advocacy group Greenpeace led a campaign against Unilever's participation in the rainforest destruction, which was seen as causing harm to native people and wildlife. Unilever responded by dropping contracts with the palm oil producers in question and lobbying its competitors Kraft, Nestlé, Cadbury, Cargill, and Proctor & Gamble to do the same. "Unilever's decision could represent a defining moment for the palm oil industry.” John Sauven, Greenpeace executive director, said in a statement in 2009.  "What we're seeing here is the world's largest buyer of palm oil using its financial muscle to sanction suppliers who are destroying rainforests and clearing peatlands. This has set a new standard for others to follow." In the years since, Unilever has been involved in efforts to promote sustainable palm oil production and it was Unilever's commitment to reducing its environmental impact that made the Seventh Generation CEO to say that the two companies would make good partners. “Today marks the next chapter and we’re proud to join Unilever and its shared vision for purpose-led business on a global scale,” Replogle said in a statement. “Working together we are confident we can have a positive impact on the health of billions of people around the world, truly fulfilling our mission of nurturing the next seven generations while transforming global commerce.” Next up Earth Day: Are you saving the planet or just showing off?

Business Gideon Spanier: Ad giants forced into U-turn as they find out too much targeting has a downside Gideon Spanier Tuesday 20 September 2016 15:34 BST Olympic gymnast Simone Biles has a Tide deal with P&G EMMANUEL DUNAND/AFP/Getty Images One of the great debates taking place in advertising at the moment is whether companies should use precision targeting or mass marketing to reach consumers. The logic of precision marketing has become seductive. We live in an online era where it’s possible for an advertiser to target customers in almost unlimited ways — by age, sex, location, personal interests, type of device, past behaviour and so on. It means that, at last, there is a solution to American department store mogul John Wanamaker’s notorious refrain that “half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don’t know which half”. Except advertisers are discovering that targeting too much carries its own risks and that “wasting money” on advertising beyond a brand’s target audience might actually be a good idea. The U-turn has been led by the world’s biggest advertiser, Procter & Gamble, maker of Tide washing powder, Fairy washing-up liquid and Pampers nappies, which has found that moving a lot of its marketing budget into targeted Facebook ads has backfired. “We targeted too much, and we went too narrow,” P&G chief brand officer Marc Pritchard confessed last month. The danger of targeting too much is that a brand loses fame and relevance. It ceases to be visible to the wider public and stops having a cultural impact. McDonald’s has just shut its YouTube channel because it realised “we weren’t reaching enough customers”, as its chief marketing officer Alistair Macrow put it. The lesson is that smartphones and laptops may be a great way to generate “direct response” — getting a loyal customer to purchase something — but they are far less effective at building a brand and winning new customers. There is a reason why, for example, every time Apple launches a new iPhone, it books the best outdoor poster sites, prime-time 30-second TV spots, and full-page ads in newspapers. Apple doesn’t just want to appeal to core fans. It wants its products to be famous and to reinforce their premium status. Last year, the iPhone maker increased its ad budget by 50% to $1.8 billion (£1.4 billion). None of this means that online advertising and the use of digital data are ineffective. The hottest media agency to launch in London this autumn is Hearts & Science, which is making use of shopper marketing, e-commerce and customer behaviour data to inform its clients’ media plans. P&G, the advertiser that now wants to target less, was Hearts & Science’s founding client in the US. As we look at how media consumption is changing, we know that the distinction between online and traditional media is already blurring — to the point where it could soon become irrelevant. What we see and hear on television and cinema screens, outdoor poster sites and radio stations, is going to be delivered digitally and in real-time (in an environment where we might pay attention, rather than allow the intimate confines of our smartphone screen to be invaded). Then the distinction that matters to advertisers becomes not the method of delivery but the ability to have mass, simultaneous reach. For advertisers, there is a simple choice: Be famous or be invisible.   More about: Advertising Business Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: All Topics All Authors Archive Terms of use Contact Us Privacy policy Cookie policy Code of Conduct & Complaints Advertisers Promotion rules Contributors Syndication Business Connections Homes & Property Jobs London Live The Independent This is London Magazine indy100 Install our apps Close We have noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

September 20, 2016 KEYWORDS food manufacturing / machine builders / machine controls Reprints No Comments Is your aging packaging line an island of automation? Do you know its OEE score? When something goes wrong, how long does it take to find the problem, fix it and get it running again? Do you know how many products you ran through it today and how many rejects you had? Article Index: PLC or PAC: Does it really matter what it’s called? PackML evolution PackML gets a little help from OPC UA Machine safety: Hardwired E-stop not dead yet Remote monitoring vs. security Sidebar: Weihenstephan Standards define communications between machines and MES Sidebar: Machine HMI design issues: Engineer, artist, linguist? Today, machine builders are creating hardware and software that communicate with the rest of your plant equipment plus your shop floor MES and ERP systems. When something breaks, chances are the machine can tell you exactly where the problem is and how to fix it. If that’s not possible, your machine builder can log onto the machine and find the fault within minutes—no travel time and no expenses. You’re back up and running. Back at headquarters, senior staff has been following the event, and immediately knows the impact on production and can adjust accordingly. Futuristic? Not really—it’s available right now. FE talked with machine builders, system integrators (SIs) and component suppliers to get a handle on what food and beverage processors can expect with the latest and future generations of machine controls. It turns out that several improvements in technology have been occurring at every level, including faster processors, cheaper and more dense memory and industry-standard machine programming and communications protocols. With these improvements, machine safety has been evolving from hardwired switches and separate safety controllers to integrated safety systems. And cybersecurity is as good as your bank’s. Sidebar: Weihenstephan Standards define communications between machines and MES Dating back to 1999 and founded and developed by the Technical University of Munich (TUM), Chair of Food Packaging Technology, the Weihenstephan Standards (WS) are popular in the beverage filling & packaging industry (WS Pack), and increasingly in the food processing industry (WS Food), and provides the link between the production management level and the machine level. WS consists of standardized data using WS production data and the WS communication protocol (WS-proprietary commands used with the TCP/IP protocol). Additionally, WS supports the ISA TR88.00.02’s (OMAC PackML) mode manager and state model. Per the Weihenstephan Standards website: “The Weihenstephan Standards (WS) define a universal communication interface for the connecting machines to higher ranking data acquisition systems or MES (Manufacturing Execution systems). They also define the data which must be provided for acquisition. Data points and contents were defined for individual industrial sectors. Up to now libraries for bottling and packaging plants (WS Pack) and machines for food processing (WS Food) have been realized.” Communication via a plug-and-play principle is made possible by automated parameterization via a device description file. Moreover, the Weihenstephan Standards give recommendations for the data evaluation (e.g., traceability, calculation of efficiency identification numbers, technical reporting) and for the approval and the safe operation of MES implementations. Source: Siemens Energy. PLC or PAC: Does it really matter what it’s called? The heart of any machine is its controller(s), which used to be the PLC. In many respects, the PLC has evolved, and the result is a single device, the programmable automation controller (PAC), which not only handles standard logic (off/on) functions, but also can provide motion/position control, robotics supervision and process control while connecting to Ethernet networks and real-time sensor/actuator networks. These capabilities are provided within an architecture, often resembling a PC, and either exist on the “motherboard” itself or through the use of plug-in cards. “This convergence of automation and IT technologies provides all the functionality needed from a PLC, while adding a wealth of other features in one programming environment,” says Bob Trask, Beckhoff Automation senior systems architect. These features include integrated motion control, kinematics, condition monitoring, programmable safety and HMI. “In the near future, we see vision and predictive maintenance functionality being implemented,” Trask adds. “[Our] TwinCAT3 automation software adds programming in Visual Studio, maximized performance for multi-core PC-based controllers and IoT [Internet of Things] solutions for easy-to-implement connectivity to the cloud.” The tools are already there, and Beckhoff is working hard to implement these IoT tools in such a way that the user does not need to be an IT expert. Has the PLC given way to the PAC? While there are applications that are better suited to either the PLC or PAC, demand for the PLC has not wavered nor has the technology been forsaken, says Bill Dehner, AutomationDirect application engineer. “In fact, a better question to ask would be: Has the PAC given life to the PLC? To that, I’d say absolutely. Many of the features desired with a PAC are now being incorporated into the industry-proven PLC. Advanced PLCs today have bigger user memories, more communication, more data storage, more integration, more remote accessibility, and are more reliable than ever before.” “PAC features are permeating the PLC world,” says Don Pham, IDEC product manager. “For example, even micro PLCs now include features that were only found in PACs as recently as a few years ago.” IDEC’s MicroSmart FC6A PLC provides PAC power with fast programming speeds, high-capacity programming and data memory—and an ability to handle up to 126 analog I/O. IoT capability is provided with custom web pages that can be configured for remote monitoring and control. “One solution for easier integration and decreased time to market is a single, scalable control platform that supports the requirements of complex, batch manufacturing processes and high-speed packaging equipment,” says John Dart, Rockwell Automation senior industry consultant. “Manufacturers should look for machine controls that can be applied across a wide range of equipment types and complexity, and integrate across a plant-wide network. This scalability and consistency can help manufacturers increase productivity and reduce ongoing operating and maintenance costs.” Rockwell’s iTRAK system controls, for example, provide mechatronic solutions to packaging systems that allow for flexibility and independent control of multiple movers on straight and curved paths. “Siemens controllers met all the requirements of the PAC long before the PAC name was created,” says Tim Parmer, factory automation - marketing, Siemens Industry. “Therefore, we have chosen to continue to refer to our hardware/software components as ‘controllers.’” The SIMATIC range of controllers comprises basic, advanced, distributed and software controllers, offering scalability and integration of their functions. # SEW-Eurodrive’s controls portfolio contains PACs, which are called “MoviPLCs,” says Rainer Neufeld, electronics manager. These PACs are available in different performance levels. “We combine optimally scalable controller hardware with easily programmable motion control software. Our continuous control program covers extensive motion functions: from single-axis positioning and electronic cams to robotics,” adds Neufeld. Whatever you call it, the move to open architecture systems is on, and machine builders have enjoyed the benefits of a wide range of controls. “We use open architecture software, such as Allen-Bradley, to allow for easy integration with other line components while giving plant technicians the ability to support and own their system versus ‘black box’ systems,” says Greg Jacob, general manager at Allpax Products, maker of retorts. However, he adds, PLC systems are still the preference, primarily due to plant history and support comfort level. Polytron, a member of the Control System Integrators Association (CSIA), provides hardware and software as part of a turnkey system, though it’s not a controls product distributor, says Scott Richards, senior project manager. “We work with many of the major automation platforms, including Rockwell Automation, Bedrock Automation, Wonderware, GE Proficy/iFIX, Siemens, Omron and others. Most PLCs would now be referred to as PACs due to their increased capabilities and features.” Bühler Aeroglide makes convective conveyor thermal processing equipment, e.g., dryers, ovens, roasters, impingement ovens or coolers, etc. According to Pei Li, senior electrical engineer, “We provide a range of machine control hardware options to control our equipment. This includes common PLC platforms, which interface to Windows-based industrial PCs. We also offer more traditional HMI/PLC solutions as necessary. In our machine control area, we have not seen a demand from our clients for PAC. Furthermore, we believe the PAC is more complex and not as robust as PLCs.” For JLS Automation, builder of robotic-based picking solutions for primary and secondary packaging applications, advanced PLC control has made design simpler. President Craig Souser notes, “We are migrated to what I call a complete machine control—PLC/Motion/HMI all running on the same platform within the same program. Advancements in motion control have made us comfortable in elimination of a standalone robot control system.” Sidebar: Machine HMI design issues: Engineer, artist, linguist? HMI graphic design is really an art form. To make a good HMI, one needs to think about the true user of the machine, the operator, and how he or she interacts with that machine every day of its life. First, engineers program the machine. They know every technical nuance in the machine and have intricate knowledge of how the machine works. So the engineer often creates an HMI for himself and not the machine’s operator. The result is a lot of buttons and technical jargon that make perfect sense to the engineer, but go way over the operator’s head. Second, most engineers are not artists. There is an entirely different set of skills needed to understand graphics, layout, color schemes—even the type of button that should be used for a certain action. Most engineers will use whatever the HMI software’s defaults are for a button or a color because that is the easiest and fastest way to complete the project. Engineers are very reliant on the HMI software vendor. If that software is not well designed, or it’s difficult to use, the programming effort may end with a sub-par HMI. The result—HMIs that all look similar in appearance. As a test, visit PACK EXPO this year and see how many HMIs use a dark blue button with white text. Third, there is a matter of time and cost. I can say first hand, that I can easily spend more time working on an HMI than I will in writing the PLC program. If an engineer wants to make nice graphics, he or she should be prepared to spend a lot of time working in a graphics program tweaking icons, scaling graphics and picking colors that work well for a specific machine. I also believe that every error of a machine should be brought out to the HMI with enough information for the end-user’s team to be able to fix the machine. One of our goals at Axon is to never force someone to access code because they cannot figure out a problem with help from the HMI. Finally, using multiple languages in an HMI can be very challenging. As the language changes (say, from English to Spanish), the text size and length vary and cause readability issues. Typically, an engineer doesn’t have the benefit of knowing abbreviations in a foreign language if he isn’t fluent in it. So, during the course of the design project, an engineer will go back and forth between languages for every screen, making sure everything fits and works. At Axon, we work with a translation company that specializes in machine translation. This is important because a lot of words, like “HOLD” for example, could mean to carry something or to pause the machine. Working with a translator that understands these differences and nuances helps to ensure language translation makes sense to the end user. —Christopher Thomas, Axon Corp. PackML evolution Today, it’s all about communications and getting important operational data to those who need it. “It’s hard to go a day without hearing the words, Internet of Things or Industry 4.0,” says Christopher Thomas, director of controls technology at Axon Corp., a division of ProMach. Axon builds shrink and stretch sleeve packaging machines. “At the heart of these initiatives is the desire to access the wealth of data that is available in PLC- and PC-based machines and turn that data into actionable information,” adds Thomas. Lately, the use of Industrial Ethernet on the plant floor is bridging the gap between the operational technology (OT) and IT networks. Ethernet is available on almost any controls, which makes machine-to-machine and line control easier to implement. As this trend continues, Thomas says the ease to integrate machines from different technology vendors will increase. “In the food and beverage industry, we expect to see less reliance on specifications naming a sole source vendor and instead more emphasis on specifying an interface [such as PackML] to connect machines,” adds Thomas. “We believe that this trend will drive innovation, better machine design and reduce cost for the end user.” “We have seen a tremendous global growth with customers—OEMs, SIs, EUs [end users]—requiring ISA TR88.00.02 [OMAC PackML]-based solutions,” says Mike Pieper, industry manager - packaging, Siemens Industry. “This is due to the demand of global EUs [i.e., Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Nestlé, Arla Foods, etc.] requiring operational consistency between all OEM machinery [consistent programming modes and states, common naming of KPI tags] and higher-level systems [line overview, OEE, MES, etc.] with OEMs looking to harmonize their various machines, reduce engineering cost, leverage reusable and modular code and minimize commissioning.” “Forward-looking machine and equipment builders see their products lasting 10 or 20 years,” says Richard Clark, InduSoft Wonderware Schneider-Electric application and process engineer. “These builders are actively pursuing PackML as a machine/process standard so their machines can interface and integrate into larger process environments as the customer’s production grows.” What are the alternatives for not pursuing PackML? Clark says either manually modifying and integrating the old, non-standard equipment into the larger automated production process or obsolescing the old equipment. “PackML can mitigate complexity and establish standards-based machine operation,” says Beckhoff’s Trask. “A benefit of PackML is the PackML state machine, which defines standard modes of operation within the manufacturing process. The PackML state machine, when properly implemented, provides a common look and feel to the basic operation of a machine,” adds Trask. “This is a proven benefit to the OEM and the end user. What is the machine doing? Why is it in this state? The OEM does not have to create this [code] from scratch, and the end user does not have to figure out what the OEM has programmed.” “In the four years that I have been working with PackML, I personally have seen a continuous growth and interest in PackML on the part of machine OEMs and end users,” says Thomas. One drawback is the current lack of an implementation guide to help those interested in PackML to get started on a project and to know what the main deliverables should be for a PackML machine. Fortunately, there is a guide in the works from the OMAC group, which got its start with automation standards in 1994. “PackML is a terrific development,” says Mike Grinager, VP of technology for Brenton Engineering, a Pro Mach business. Brenton makes end-of-line packaging equipment such as cartoners, case packers, palletizers, etc. “However, it is a development that will take its own time and path through the packaging industry, and it will evolve.” There will not be, strictly speaking, only one PackML. For example, a number of Brenton’s Fortune 100 customers have their own internal versions of PackML. These versions could be described as dialects of PackML, which are optimized for these large companies’ environments. “PackML has a number of positive attributes for OEMs in terms of lowering engineering overhead and allowing the OEM to be more productive,” adds Grinager. “Customers may not even be aware when they receive a machine [where the] PackML standard was utilized.” While PackML is not a monolithic development soon to be on everyone’s shop floor, it is a powerful tool to be used when and where it is most appropriate. PackML gets a little help from OPC UA “While PackML provides a common look and feel to a machine or production process, getting this information out to the decision-makers and plant personnel requires a secure, vendor- and OS-independent transport mechanism such as OPC UA [Unified Architecture],” says Beckhoff’s Trask. OPC UA, as a transport mechanism on top of TCP/IP, moves key data to decision-makers and plant personnel. “OPC UA offers built-in security and data encryption, and is ideal for exchanging data both horizontally with other machines on the floor and vertically into the cloud for access anywhere in the world,” adds Trask. “This adds valuable and tangible benefits for concepts such as ‘Smart Factory’ and ‘Industry 4.0.’” The biggest challenge today with PackML is the lack of a standard communication protocol defined to allow communications with a machine no matter what control system is being used, says Axon’s Thomas. While a machine has an Ethernet port, this doesn’t guarantee any level of compatibility. Most major technology vendors have their own specific protocol, which typically doesn’t cross over to other vendors. This is where a universal protocol like OPC UA is needed. “We are watching closely the development of OPC UA in the industry and believe OPC UA will be the great equalizer for manufacturers as it addresses so many pressing needs and is not specific to any vendor,” adds Thomas. Travis Cox, co-director of sales engineering at Inductive Automation (provider of Ignition software), sees the interoperability issues with equipment and software as a really hot topic of concern. “If the device is proprietary and requires specific software for programming or visualization, it will become an isolated silo of data. Devices should use open standards, such as OPC UA or MQTT, which allow interoperability.” MQTT (fka MQ Telemetry Transport) is an ISO standards-based, publish-subscribe system, which is a lightweight messaging protocol for use on top of the TCP/IP protocol stack. MQTT requires a message broker, which is responsible for distributing messages to clients requesting a specific message topic—e.g., a certain process temperature or reject info. Machine safety: Hardwired E-stop not dead yet Machine safety is, of course, a big deal. No one wants a warning or fine from OSHA. It used to be that an E-stop switch was hardwired such that hitting it would stop a machine, or an interlock switch would stop a machine or immediate section of it when a door or panel was opened. It also used to be that a parallel controller or PLC known as a “safety PLC” would run in conjunction with the main process controller, being able to shut down the equipment when a process or machine was progressing towards dangerous limits. Today, E-stops and interlocks are moving away from hard wired power interrupters to safety-based software solutions that receive a signal from a sensor, switch or other computed value, then shutting down the correct apparatus. But now a safety PLC can potentially reside on the same rack, chassis or board. How safe are these changes? What is the design philosophy for safety-rated systems? Can operators be prevented from “cheating” the interlock system? “The large manufacturers are now beginning to standardize to Category 3 safety requirements, which include a special ‘safety PLC’ to provide redundant back-up controls and emergency stop scenarios,” says Allpax’s Jacob. “In addition, fencing with OSHA-approved gate permissive controls for entry, light curtains and physical machine guarding continue to evolve in required specification scope documents.” For systems where E-stops or interlocks are activated via a touchscreen, there’s a method to protect people from getting their hands into operating machinery, says Tim Donaldson, Progea North America sales manager. “Multi-touch with two buttons on a screen to [stop] it. This will ensure both hands are not inside the machine.” “We design safety as an integral feature in all of our systems,” says Polytron’s Richards. “We also offer safety risk assessments and safety mitigation for existing equipment. A properly designed safety system will be very difficult for an operator to override; at a minimum, such bypasses would be documented and alarmed. Modern safety systems utilize software as well as redundant wiring. We make no distinction that software-based systems are somehow less safe. If that were the case, we would never use them.” “Software-based solutions can actually [ensure a] higher level of safety as it’s more difficult to override if implemented properly,” says JLS Automation’s Souser. “Drive-based safety is much faster and more distributed so that makes for a safer solution.” “Machine-based risk analysis and mitigation plans are critical to engineering safety,” says Doug Beloskur, automation manager at Bühler Aeroglide. “Based on our mitigation strategy, we can design safety systems to lower the risk of personnel injury and machinery damage. In mind of simplicity, we utilize hardwired interlocking for electrical means of risk mitigation. We make efforts to design out major hazards up front to eliminate the need for safety PLC systems.” Beloskur also says that providing as much safety-related information to operators as possible, which can be accomplished through audible and visual warnings, is extremely important. Operator training is an absolute necessity so the right safety decisions can be made to protect operators and machinery, and this also includes well placed safety labels on all equipment. “Lastly, regarding software-based emergency stops,” continues Beloskur, “we do not believe this is reliable enough or yet acceptable by our customer standards.” Remote monitoring vs. security Remote access/monitoring would seem to be at odds with security, but if implemented properly, remotely viewing operations or equipment can bring dividends—both from production and maintenance (remote troubleshooting) standpoints. “Operations personnel want remote access because it means faster, easier problem resolution,” says Brenton’s Grinager. “The IT department typically does not want to grant remote access because so much in the plant is linked back to the MRP system. It is a big problem, and both sides have valid points.” “Maintaining line efficiency is super critical for plants to hit their budgeted goals for line production,” says Allpax’s Jacob. “Monitoring machines to report efficiency and resolve downtime scenarios is very valuable. Line efficiency gains typically far outweigh monitoring costs and make ROI justification an easy decision.” Some processors are still reluctant to allow monitoring and servicing remotely on their machines, but this has been slowly changing over the years, though it’s still an uphill battle for machine builders. “It is our belief that most customers want the technology, but there is a lot of concern over security and the awareness of friction with the IT department anytime these requests are made,” says Axon’s Thomas. Axon offers a remote monitoring and service package called ProTech by Pro Mach with its machines, which allows troubleshooting without sending a technician to the site, incurring further costs. This gets customers back up and running faster. “It is our hope that as the use of Industrial Ethernet grows, the IT and OT networks will begin to work much better together, and this will open the door for remote monitoring and access,” says Thomas. Today, OEMs have the technology to make remote monitoring safe. “We depend on the security of the plant network to safeguard individual machinery,” says Bühler’s Pei Li. “However, we understand the need for remote access of our machines from time to time. In these cases, we utilize VPN connections to gain access.” For further security, this OEM’s equipment offers customizable user-level security to suit each client’s needs. JLS Automation takes monitoring beyond just the typical equipment sensor data. “We equip all of our machines with remote access and are offering cameras to monitor lines. We work with the end customer to help them troubleshoot, and in more and more cases, this is the operator and not maintenance. We are looking to embed videos in our HMI to facilitate the training of new operators to a machine.” While you might think security issues only concern themselves with hackers breaking in and destroying equipment, probably the more relevant concern is leakage of intellectual property—and not necessarily through hacks. SEW’s Neufeld explains: “There is still an acceptance problem when it comes to letting other companies supervise production equipment. On one hand, everyone wants the quick support and in-time diagnosis; on the other hand, no one wants fact(s) such as production speed or quality to be known outside the company. SEW understands this dilemma, and our answer has been to offer diagnosis that can be used remotely—but only if the operator allows it.” Finally, at the plant level, a tiered password structure maintains security. At the network level, the OEM and the processor’s IT department need to coordinate so that both groups understand the needs and requirements of the other, says Grinager. Virtual private networks (VPNs) linking only the machine, or an island of machines, back to the OEM is the current state of the art. Are VPNs secure? “Some VPN hardware and software combinations mirror the same high level of security one finds in the banking industry,” says Grinager.

But if you’re working at Flipkart, Larsen & Toubro, Procter & Gamble, InMobi and Amazon, among others, you might just get a free chopper ride this Diwali. These industry giants are trying their way best to woo their employees and give them the best Diwali of their lives. royaltyluxurylimousine Chopper rides, gourmet testing, or a tree house stay instead of the conventional mithai will entice a lot of people this year. You think of it and they’ve got it. The companies have also shown interest in offering dinner on a yacht with family, pizza making session in a luxury hotel for kids, exclusive movie screening for the entire family or the opportunity to record your own song are also on the table. According to a Chennai-based firm BI Worldwide, the entire approach to offering people rewards is associated with the memory. As much as 70% of decisions are driven by emotions than the brain and when employees are given such benefits, they tend to remember it for a longer time. prostatecanceruk “Companies have understood that the rewards efficacy is measured by creating lifetime memories, which have a high re-consumption value every time that memory is shared or recalled, against cash incentives that are short term,” said Siddharth Reddy, CEO at BI Worldwide. “We are consciously designing experiences. The idea is to gift memories to good performers as part of a long-term retention strategy,” said Manoj Biswas, human resource head at Larsen & Toubro. L&T plans to offer wine yard tours, tree-house stays, skydiving and gourmet testing sessions to employees in the coming festival season. They’ve further explained that the average budget doesn’t exceed 10,000 and in return, they get a lot of acknowledgement from spouses and children. cooknwithclass “Gifting a movie ticket or cash is passé. says a spokesperson from InMobi. The new way is to give them experience that they can remember and surprise them by customised vacations; from beer festivals in Berlin to a trip in Bali or Europe. It’s true that employees don’t remember the amount of bonus given to them—it’s usually lost in everyday life, but an experience like this stays. Every time the person would see those pictures or remember the moment, he is bound to go back to the awesome time. This way, you earn a great performer for life.  2.1k facebook twitter reddit Comment Here Follow @indiatimes Our Channels News Lifestyle Entertainment Health Videos Sports Trending Sections india world sports weird self style Tech who we are travel food bollywood celebscoop hollywood Healthy Living Recipes Inspire Tips & Tricks Buzz Photogallery Indiatimes Lifestyle Network MENS XP iDiva Luxury Ask Men Pursuitist Specials #FRONTLINES #GOFORGOLD #INDIANAMA Other Sites News – TO CricBuzz Happy Trips Business Insider ZoomTv Gizmodo Lifehacker IGN BoxTV Gaana Online Shopping Techradar Daily Deals Gitanjali Shop Satvik Shop WHAT'S HOT ZigWheels FILMIPOP Filmfare Femina Mobile Greetings Follo Jobs Property Astrology Speaking Tree Matrimonial iTimes Ads2book TcNext Romedy Now About us Mobile Apps ARCHIVES sitemap Contact us ABOUT INDIATIMES Privacy Policy Terms & CONDITIONS Copyright © 2016 Times Internet Limited.

The Dutch head office of Unilever in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, is pictured in this 2000 file photo. File photo by Peter Dejong The Associated Press i Bloomberg LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Unilever has agreed to acquire Seventh Generation Inc., a Vermont-based company known for natural and eco-conscious cleaning products. Seventh Generation posted sales of more than $200 million last year, Unilever said in a statement Monday. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. The transaction is part of a push by Unilever to claim more of the natural section of supermarket aisles. Millennials have increasingly sought out upstart brands that are seen as being environmentally friendly, putting pressure on some traditional wares. Seventh Generation — promoted by comedian Maya Rudolph in ads — sells detergents, dish cleaners and other products that are free of artificial fragrances and dyes. Unilever considers Seventh Generation a “purpose-driven brand,” akin to its Ben & Jerry’s and Dove products. “This addition to Unilever’s product portfolio will help us meet rising demand for high-quality products with a purpose,” Nitin Paranjpe, president of Unilever’s home-care division, said in the statement. The lineup may help Unilever mount a bigger challenge to market leader Procter & Gamble, said Ali Dibadj, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. “We have for a long time been very impressed by Seventh Generation in terms of its management, its innovation and bringing to the consumer what it is they want,” he said. “It puts a little more pressure on companies such as Procter & Gamble to offer what the consumer wants in terms of environmentally friendly products.” Unilever previously has expressed interest in buying Honest Co., a person familiar with the situation said last week. That company — co-founded by actress Jessica Alba — also has a natural focus, though it concentrates more on baby care and personal-hygiene products. That raises the question of whether the Seventh Generation deal will affect those deliberations, Dibadj said. “On one hand, it does suggest they’re interested in this sort of business,” he said. “On the other hand, it feels like they’ve now already made a bet in that space.” Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Business Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 3:47 Refugee children in Kansas City find solace in soccer Pause 8:28 KC Star 'New Wave of Hip Hop' group cypher 2:03 See and experience Pompeii in new Union Station exhibit 0:14 Who kicked this small dog down a flight of stairs?

At a recent business forum in Hanoi, Phan Chi Dung of the MOIT told a capacity audience that the growth of the foreign sector in the market for so called fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) has really put the pressure on domestic brands. Mr Dung, who is the general director of the MOIT Light Industries Department, said FMCG are consumer goods that people use every day and purchase frequently that have a useful life of less than one year. More durable goods that have a useful life of more than one year and a slower sales frequency such as household appliances, furniture and home improvement products are referred to as slow-moving consumer goods (SMCG). The competitive landscape for FMCG is being shaped by large transnational consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies the likes of US-based Procter & Gamble (P&G), Unilever, L’Oréal and Nestlé. These large companies, said Mr Dung, have invested large amounts of money into research and development of their brands and fine-tuned their products specifically to meet with Vietnamese consumer tastes and demand. Many of these CPG companies are manufacturing their products in China and Thailand and shipping them into Vietnam, which accounts for increased exports in the latest official figures from these two countries. In addition, brands from Japan and the Republic of Korea have made significant headway into the local FMCG market as evidenced by the proliferation of convenience stores in the nation’s major cities. At the forum there was considerable discussion about the lop-sidedness of the market penetration achieved by the foreign sector in reference to development in the nation’s urban and less densely populated rural areas. There was general consensus by the panel of government and economic leaders at the forum that the increased market share achieved by the foreign sector is largely confined to the urban areas, consistent with a 2015 Nielsen forecast. There was also much speculation as to why Vietnamese are choosing foreign made goods over locally produced. Some members of the panel and audience suggested consumers have simply lost faith in the food safety of locally produced goods. Others said they thought Vietnamese brands were of equivalent quality and price but that foreign companies did a much better job of advertising and marketing their products and truly ‘branding’ them in the mind of the Vietnamese consumer. Mr Dung, suggested local companies selling FMCG adjust their sale strategies to concentrate more heavily on the rural areas in the short term while they strategize how to compete more effectively with the savvier CPG and other foreign products entering the market.

About Us Our People Advertising News Sports Shows WV Poll Outdoors Manchin attends Martinsburg job fair Share Article By Hans Fogle in News | September 19, 2016 at 3:21PM MARTINSBURG, W.Va. — Hundreds attended a job and resource fair in Martinsburg Monday hosted by WorkForce West Virginia and U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D, W.Va.). More than 100 companies and organizations took information from job seekers throughout the four hour long event at the Foxcroft Towne Center. Manchin said there is an obvious demand from employers in West Virginia. “Everyone I talk to, they’re all hiring,” Manchin told WV MetroNews affiliate WEPM. “We just need more workers who want to work.” The fair also featured tools to help job seekers develop their careers such as GetReady Resources, as well as a MilitaryZone, which will provided information about getting an education through the military, or the military service academies. Manchin said WorkForce West Virginia was instrumental in the fair and in continuing to help put West Virginians to work. “They’re working every day trying to place West Virginians, and people in surrounding states, Maryland and Virginia, in the best jobs we can.” One of the big draws at the fair was Procter & Gamble, the company building a manufacturing site in the Tabler Station Business Park in South Berkeley County with the promise of hundreds of new jobs. Human Resources Department leader for the new site Ryan Moore said the posting for new jobs was posted again Monday morning, just in time for the fair. He said they plan to hire 300 people by this time next fall. “Depending on the business need by month and when we need to be hiring we’ll make the decision on what the amount is at that time,” he said. The applications they collect now are to be reviewed in January. Moore said they will start hiring in late winter or early spring. Another new company looking to hire a total of 140 people was there as well. Area Manager of the new Chili’s restaurant in Martinsburg Bill Libby said Martinsburg is the place to be. “This economy is booming right now with the Procter and Gamble coming in, the mall being revamped and reimaged,” he said. “We want to be a part of it.” Libby said they are looking for another 100 employees before they open in two weeks. Manchin said despite a steady flow Monday there are challenges to overcome, including an epidemic of drugs that prevent many from entering the workforce. “We’ve got to start getting this population clean,” Manchin said. He hopes to pass legislation to help fund increased rehabilitation and educational outreach programs with a once-cent tax per milligram of prescribed narcotics. Manchin said it could put more than $1 billion into such efforts.   Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Hans Fogle hfogle@wvradio.com Hans Fogle grew up in Martinsburg, W.Va.

Here's some advice USA TODAY 9/17/2016 Mark Hulbert © Nicolas McComber/Getty Images A man checks stock market quotes on his tablet and in the newspaper. Nicolas McComber/Getty Images Have the stock market’s big drops over the last week convinced you that we’re now in a bear market? If so, you might want to favor consumer staples stocks and avoid financials. Popular Searches Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 759.02 +2.62 +0.35% Abercrombie & Fitch Co ANF ▼ 14.56 -2.37 -14.02% SolarCity Corp SCTY ▲ 20.54 +0.14 +0.66% Williams-Sonoma Inc WSM ▼ 53.49 -0.13 -0.24% And if you instead are giving the bull market the benefit of the doubt? Believe it or not, the same advice applies. Ned Davis Research found that, just as was the case with bear markets, consumer staples are one of the better relative performers over the last few months of bull markets — and financials was one of the worst. Consumer Staples, of course, are goods that we need all the time — such as food, beverages and basic household items — and which therefore are relatively resistant to the ebb and flow of the economy. The largest two consumer staples companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index are Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola. The financials sector, in contrast, is very much cyclical. It consists of banks and other financial service firms. The largest bank in the S&P 500, for example, is JPMorgan. In contrast to these two sectors, the fortunes of the other S&P 500 sectors depend heavily on whether we’re in a late-stage bull market or early in a bear market. Consider the consumer discretionary sector, which contains companies such as home improvement retailer Lowe's and online seller Amazon.com. Not surprisingly, this sector is at or near the top of the sector rankings for late-bull-market performance, according to the Ned Davis data — but near the bottom during the first months of bear markets. Before investing in sectors like consumer discretionary it’s crucial to determine whether we’re in a bull or a bear market. Since the vast majority of stock market timers are unable to consistently forecast major market turning points, playing the sector rotation game can be risky. There are several reasons why the performance ranks of the consumer staples and financials sectors are steadier. One reason that consumer staples companies don’t take a big a turn for the worse in bear markets, for example, is that we need the goods they produce no matter how bad our financial situation might become. Higher interest rates are a primary cause of the consistently poor performance of financial stocks at the end of bull markets and the beginning of bears. Rising rates cut into such companies’ profits and, historically, rates have begun to rise several months before bull markets have come to an end. This is particularly relevant today, given the market’s intense speculation that the Federal Reserve might raise rates as soon as its meeting on Sept. 20-21. Even if you are uncertain whether the bull market has ended or will do so soon, you might be able to sleep more easily at night by reducing your exposure to financials and reinvesting the proceeds in consumer staples stocks. To be sure, you won’t be the first to make this bet. Of the three dozen consumer staples stocks within the S&P 500, in fact, just four have price/earnings ratios that are lower than that of the overall market. But those four deserve a second look: Mondelez International (MDLZ), the maker of snacks and beverages; Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), the agribusiness company; and two major retailers: Kroger (KR), and Walmart Stores (WMT).

Transaction brings bigger presence in natural-product category Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Unilever agreed to acquire Seventh Generation Inc., a Vermont-based company known for natural and eco-conscious cleaning products. Seventh Generation posted sales of more than $200 million last year, with compound annual growth in the double digits over the past decade, Unilever said in a statement Monday. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. The transaction is part of a push by Unilever to claim more of the natural section of supermarket aisles. Millennials have increasingly sought out upstart brands that are seen as being environmentally friendly, putting pressure on some traditional wares. Unilever considers Seventh Generation a “purpose-driven brand,” akin to its Ben & Jerry’s and Dove products. “This addition to Unilever’s product portfolio will help us meet rising demand for high-quality products with a purpose,” Nitin Paranjpe, president of Unilever’s home-care division, said in the statement. Seventh Generation -- promoted by comedian Maya Rudolph in ads -- sells detergents, dish cleaners and other products that are free of artificial fragrances and dyes. The lineup may help Unilever mount a bigger challenge to market leader Procter & Gamble Co., said Ali Dibadj, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. ‘More Pressure’ “We have for a long time been very impressed by Seventh Generation in terms of its management, its innovation and bringing to the consumer what it is they want,” he said. “It puts a little more pressure on companies such as Procter & Gamble to offer what the consumer wants in terms of environmentally friendly products.” Unilever previously has expressed interest in buying Honest Co., a person familiar with the situation said last week. That company -- co-founded by actress Jessica Alba -- also has a natural focus, though it concentrates more on baby care and personal-hygiene products. That raises the question of whether the Seventh Generation deal will affect those deliberations, Dibadj said. “On one hand, it does suggest they’re interested in this sort of business,” he said. “On the other hand, it feels like they’ve now already made a bet in that space.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Josh Garcia hosts the show, which explores the history and culture of various ports through meetings with locals. (Carnival Corporation via AP) MIAMI • Saturday mornings are going to Carnival Corporation. The cruising giant is breaking new ground in the cruise industry with the production of three travel-related TV shows set to appear on major networks on Saturdays starting Oct. 1. The cruise company, headquartered outside Miami, announced the programming Monday — scheduled to air on ABC, NBC and The CW — designed to introduce more travelers to the possibility of a cruise vacation. Each lifestyle series sets out to capture a different aspect of the cruising experience. “Ocean Treks with Jeff Corwin” will take viewers adventure-hunting around the world with the Emmy-winning host. “The Voyager with Josh Garcia” will focus on authentic local experiences with the video journalist. “Vacation Creation” will feature comedian Tommy Davidson and YouTube star Andrea Feczko as they try to create memorable vacations for deserving families, individuals or couples. All share one common thread: Recurring images of the ships across Carnival Corp.’s 10 brands. “It all began right there on that ship!” calls out Jeff Corwin after scaling 1,500 feet on Cadillac Mountain in Maine during a teaser for “Ocean Treks.” Beneath him, viewers see Holland America’s 1,350-passenger MS Veendam. On “The Voyager,” Josh Garcia concludes a day of exploration by heading “back to the ship to swap stories and plan the adventures ahead,” while images of Carnival Cruise Line ships roll by in a teaser. And in a trailer for “Vacation Creation,” a family gets a tour aboard a Princess Cruises ship on a trip to Italy. Using TV or visual media to market content is not new across industries (Procter and Gamble created soap operas to show case their products, for instance), but it has become a growing trend, said Sam Slaughter, vice president of content at Contently, a New York-based content marketing technology company. “(Producing TV shows) tends to be less expensive and it tends to yield higher returns. You are just paying for the production as opposed to paying to reach the audience (like with a commercial),” Slaughter said. “The idea that brands can do that kind of thing is starting to gain more traction … and the travel industry is ripe for this.” In the past, cruise ships have been featured in documentaries and scripted television shows, such as “The Love Boat,” but Carnival Corp.’s approach is novel, said Colleen McDaniel, senior executive editor of trade publication CruiseCritic.com. “Taking a reality television approach to showcasing cruise travel is something that is unprecedented,” McDaniel said. “It will give viewers a deeper, inspirational look at the entire experience, and that’s something we haven’t really seen before.” See how St. Louis stocks are faring Here are the best large places to work in St. Louis Meet the top midsized workplaces in St. Louis Meet the best small businesses to work at in St. Louis Central to a shows’ success is its ability to feel authentic while promoting a Carnival vacation, said John Padgett, chief experience and innovation officer at Carnival Corp. “All the content we are creating, while it’s definitely entertaining and engaging, the intent is to truly authentically represent what any guest can experience on a cruise,” Padgett said. “The level of brand placement is pure, so there is brand placement there when it’s appropriate.” Padgett, who was one of the chief designers of Walt Disney Parks & Resorts’ MagicBand, said the cruise company’s mission is to envision the next innovation and do things guests wouldn’t anticipate. Stirring excitement for cruising is central in the industry’s battle to catch up to its biggest rival: Land-based vacations. About 24.2 million people are expected to take a cruise vacation by the end of 2016, a slight increase over 2015, according to the Cruise Lines International Association. That’s a small fraction of the billions of vacations expected to take place by the end of the year. In 2015, a record 1.2 billion tourists traveled internationally, according to the UN World Tourism Organization. Five to six billion tourists traveled domestically.  Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Political Reporter For Dailymail.com In New York, Ny Published: 15:06 EST, 19 September 2016 | Updated: 17:52 EST, 19 September 2016 e-mail 72 shares 70 View comments A number of big-name corporations have donated to the Clinton Global Initiative, which kicked off today in New York City and is the last of its kind, as Bill Clinton slowly steps away from his foundation in case wife Hillary Clinton wins the White House.   Corporate sponsors include Hewlett-Packard, McDonald's and Western Union, with the CGI also partnering with Microsoft, Cisco and Procter & Gamble. And while the confab isn't nearly as CEO-studded as in years past, bosses from Sony, GlaxoSmithKline, Cisco and Unilever are slated to speak. The Clinton Global Initiative is part of the Clinton Foundation, which has become controversial within the context of the presidential campaign as Hillary Clinton's rival Donald Trump and his allies have pointed fingers at the charity, suggesting there was some pay-to-play when the Democratic nominee was secretary of state. Scroll down for video   Former President Bill Clinton kicked off a final Clinton Global Initiative today in New York as he begins winding down his foundation's work in case Hillary Clinton wins the White House  Former and perhaps future first daughter Chelsea Clinton was on hand at the Clinton Global Initiative today, which still attracted a handful of corporate donors amid pay-to-play claims Hillary Clinton's emails show Clinton Foundation donors getting access to her top aides, but no correspondence has yet to prove that special favors by government employees were carried out.  Still yet, this year's conference is a diminished version of itself. Yes, there are celebrities, world leaders and CEOs, but it's not the power players meet-up that once warranted a Forbes article on what to wear, as even Hillary Clinton – likely for political purposes – is skipping out, like she did last year.  Gone are the Republicans – like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, now tasked with running Trump's transition team, and Carly Fiorina, who ran for president as well – who have appeared in the past.  Not coming is President Barack Obama, even though he's in New York for the U.N. General Assembly and is attending a number of political fundraisers. And also vanished are some corporate sponsors from years before including The Coca-Cola Company, Monsanto, ExxonMobil, Deutsche Bank and Samsung.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Clinton donors DID give money to get access to Hillary...

Bernie Sanders in New Jersey.  Bill Clinton lamented having to give up his foundation, and in turn CGI, during an interview recorded last night with NPR. 'It's hard, but, you know, if Hillary is elected I'm looking forward to it,' he said. 'And you know, we always say in response to our critics, that nobody in my family ever took a penny out of this foundation and put millions of dollars in,' Clinton said, trying to set the record straight.  But over the course of the interview he also admitted that at least some of the Clinton Foundation donors probably did so to gain access to the Clintons, with a Clinton White House 2.0 in mind.  'Well, since we had more than 300,000 donors it would be unusual if nobody did,' Bill Clinton said.  'It was natural for people who've been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things,' Clinton said. 'And I trusted the State Department wouldn't do anything they shouldn't do, from a meeting to a favor.'  'And so it didn't surprise me that people would call from time to time and maybe some of them gave money for that reason, but most of them gave it because they liked what we were doing because they knew me,' he added.

By Jack Neff. Published on September 19, 2016. Reprints Reprints Credit: Seventh Generation Most Popular Unilever has agreed to buy Seventh Generation for an undisclosed sum, the company announced today, intensifying efforts to snatch up fast-growing, e-commerce-focused household and personal-care brands. The deal comes months after Unilever agreed to buy Dollar Shave Club in a billion-dollar deal and amid reports it's in talks to buy Honest Co. With annual sales of around $200 million annually, Seventh Generation appears around the size of Dollar Shave Club. Honest Co. is bigger, with sales of more than $500 million last year, according to people familiar with the matter. The 28-year-old Seventh Generation has had double-digit compounded annual sales growth over the past 10 years, Unilever said. And while it's not an e-commerce pure play like Dollar Shave Club, it and other players in the natural/eco-friendly household-products market have for years gotten more than a quarter of their sales online, well ahead of the rest of the consumer package goods industry. Related Stories Unilever in Talks to Buy Jessica Alba's Honest Co. for $1 Billion Unilever Buys Dollar Shave Club for $1 Billion, Opening New Front Against P&G Seventh Generation Selects 72andSunny After Review Maya Rudolph Gets Real in Seventh Generation's New Spot "Seventh Generation has long been a disruptor in the U.S. marketplace, leading the industry in sustainable innovation while attracting new generations of conscious consumers," said Nitin Paranjpe, president of Unilever's Home Care business, in a statement. "This addition to Unilever's product portfolio will help us meet rising demand for high-quality products with a purpose." The deal puts Unilever back into the laundry and household products business in North America, eight years after divesting its old business, and such brands as All, Wisk and Snuggle, to Sun Products. As with Dollar Shave Club, Seventh Generation is a largely North American brand that presents Unilever with an opportunity for global expansion, and Unilever sells such mainstream detergent brands as Omo and Persil overseas. Unilever President-North America Kees Kruythoff said the acquisition expands Unilever's portfolio of "purpose-driven brands like Ben & Jerry's and Dove" and demonstrates the company's commitment to its sustainable living plan, by which it looks to grow while halving the environmental impact of its products by 2030. Seventh Generation CEO John Replogle, who also led Burt's Bees prior to its sale to Clorox Co. nine years ago, said in the statement: "Working together, we are confident we can have a positive impact on the health of billions of people around the world, truly fulfilling our mission of nurturing the next seven generations while transforming global commerce." Mr. Replogle, who along with Seventh Generation board member Laura Klauberg is a Unilever alum, was seen by many as on a mission to sell the company when he came on board in 2011 following a four-year transition period at Burt's Bees under Clorox. But he said at the time that wasn't his mission, and he was at Seventh Generation more than five years before today's news -- considerably longer than the year he spent at Burt's Bees prior to the Clorox deal. Seventh Generation and Honest Co. have been on opposite sides of one natural-products controversy of late. The latter has been criticized and ultimately sued over tests conducted and reported earlier this year by the Wall Street Journal that found the sudsing agent sodium lauryl sulfate in its products despite claims to the contrary. Honest Co. has denied it has SLS. Seventh Generation long has used and disclosed SLS, which it doesn't consider to be at odds with its products' natural positioning. Seventh Generation last year appointed 72 and Sunny as its agency of record and launched a new campaign from the agency, much like Unilever's Axe, which also added the agency last year and tapped it to help launch a new global campaign.

According to Randall Rothenberg, the president and CEO of the IAB: Advertising funds the diversity of information, entertainment, and services on the free Internet, but that doesn’t give business a license to abuse the good will of consumers. It is essential that industry create standards to assure that consumers get safe, fast, secure delivery of the sites and services they love. The IAB has already launched an initiative, LEAN, that aims to promote digital ads that light, encrypted, ad choice supported, and non-invasive, and a set of DEAL recommendations that publishers can follow to address ad blocking. The Coalition for Better Ads looks to bring together a broader consortium of ad industry players to identify new standards that can improve the digital ad experience, implement the technologies needed for these standards, and promote the standards so that they’re put into use. The Coalition will work with the IAB’s Tech Lab, which is already involved in implementing technical standards for the online ad industry, so it appears possible that some of the early work of The Coalition for Better Ads will build off of the IAB’s existing work, such as the LEAN initiative, which includes plans for ad scoring technology that can be used to determine whether ads meet the target user experience standards. Is the industry too late? While research shows that most consumers are not opposed to online advertising on principle, the continued growth of ad blockers reflects the fact that large numbers of consumers are simply fed up with the bad apples and would rather block all ads by default. Absent broad change that can protect consumers from the bad apples, it seems unlikely that ad blockers are going away. And now that one of the most popular ad blockers is getting into the ad business with the launch of an RTB platform, the situation is becoming more complex, which could make it more difficult for organizations like the IAB and The Coalition for Better Ads to effect broad change. The good news is that the industry isn’t helpless. Consumers are willing to disable their ad blockers when asked under the right circumstances, so while they wait for the industry-wide solutions The Coalition for Better Ads aims to deliver, publishers can fight back by producing high-value content and taking responsibility for the ads that they serve.

Unilever agreed to acquire Seventh Generation Inc., a Vermont-based company known for natural and eco-conscious cleaning products. Seventh Generation posted sales of more than $200 million last year, with compound annual growth in the double digits over the past decade, Unilever said in a statement Monday. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. The transaction is part of a push by Unilever to claim more of the natural section of supermarket aisles. Millennials have increasingly sought out upstart brands that are seen as being environmentally friendly, putting pressure on some traditional wares. Unilever considers Seventh Generation a “purpose-driven brand,” akin to its Ben & Jerry’s and Dove products. “This addition to Unilever’s product portfolio will help us meet rising demand for high-quality products with a purpose,” Nitin Paranjpe, president of Unilever’s home-care division, said in the statement. Seventh Generation—promoted by comedian Maya Rudolph in ads—sells detergents, dish cleaners and other products that are free of artificial fragrances and dyes. The lineup may help Unilever mount a bigger challenge to market leader Procter & Gamble Co., said Ali Dibadj, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. ‘More pressure’ “We have for a long time been very impressed by Seventh Generation in terms of its management, its innovation and bringing to the consumer what it is they want,” he said. “It puts a little more pressure on companies such as Procter & Gamble to offer what the consumer wants in terms of environmentally friendly products.” Unilever previously has expressed interest in buying Honest Co., a person familiar with the situation said last week. That company—co-founded by actress Jessica Alba—also has a natural focus, though it concentrates more on baby care and personal-hygiene products. That raises the question of whether the Seventh Generation deal will affect those deliberations, Dibadj said. “On one hand, it does suggest they’re interested in this sort of business,” he said. “On the other hand, it feels like they’ve now already made a bet in that space.” Retail & ApparelSmall Business Get Crain's Daily Alert Sign up for our FREE daily email newsletter.

Skip to content Beet.TV Search for: IAB Tech Lab Helping To Fix ‘Annoying Ads’, Promote Video Globally   By Steve Ellwanger on September 19, 2016September 19, 2016 @steveellwanger COLOGNE-The Internet Advertising Bureau Tech Lab is participating in two new coalitions, whose mandates are to improve the digital advertising experience for consumers and establish standards for video ads in conjunction with the television industry. Announced at the DMEXCO conference and exposition, the Coalition for Better Ads is in large part a response to the rise of ad blocking technology for digital devices, according to Alanna Gombert, General Manager of the IAB Tech Lab, which is independent of the IAB. “We’re seeing a lot of chatter around consumers being angry about digital advertising,” Gombert says in an interview with Beet.TV while attending DMEXCO. “They are annoyed by ads that cover content, they’re annoyed by clinky, shaky, flashy ads and I think it’s time for us as an industry to figure out how do we fix that for the consumer.” The Coalition for Better Ads is a who’s who of the advertising and media world. Members include brand marketers Procter & Gamble and Unilever, publishers like The Washington Post, the Association of National Advertisers, the 4A’s, media investment network GroupM and digital behemoths Facebook and Google. In the fourth quarter of this year, the IAB Tech Lab will release an algorithm based on its own work and that of the Coalition for Better Ads. The algorithm will score publisher inventory based on the Tech Lab’s LEAN Ads Program (Light, Encrypted, Ad choice supported, Non-invasive ads.) “We will publish an actual script that will score publisher inventory first,” says Gombert. Next year will see the release of scores related to creative assets. According to Gombert, the Coalition’s efforts are not intended to point fingers at individual entities. “It’s more about scoring the experience overall. There’s no blame, but it helps both sides of the fence understand what their assets are doing,” she says. The second coalition with which the IAB Tech Lab is working will create new global guidelines for simplifying the distribution of digital video ads throughout the ad production sector. It’s a mix of trade groups that includes the ANA, 4A’s, North American Broadcasters Association and the Society of Cable Telecommunications Engineers. “We’re going to build a new network that takes learnings from cable engineers and television engineers to make a larger play for digital video,” Gombert says. This interview was taped at DMEXCO ’16. It is part of a video series of industry leaders. The series is sponsored by Videology. For more Beet.TV coverage of DMEXCO, please visit this page.

Those that are able to implement the most agile real-time marketing strategies will be the brands able to capture market share and, ultimately, sales and loyalty long-term. An agile marketing campaign is one in which marketers develop branded content in response to real-time events. During the 2016 Summer Olympic Games, for example, brands like Visa and Procter & Gamble ran ads about the events in Rio de Janeiro, cleverly combining their messaging with the Olympic spirit to resonate with fans around the world. These campaigns captured consumer attention and positively impacted brand reputation. The best agile marketing strategies are relevant and respond quickly to timely news, leveraging tools like social media and email that allow for fast communication and ultimately engagement. However, because larger brands often have many hoops to jump through internally, small businesses are often more agile and typically have an easier time navigating these campaigns. Despite the more complex processes, bigger companies can mirror small business’s real-time efforts by: Responding to events in a timely fashion: The average consumer or business decision maker today has a shorter attention span than a goldfish–or approximately eight seconds. This means that the window of time brands have to effectively engage with a consumer or a business is smaller than ever. For these larger brands, reaching their audience during this small window is of course easier said than done. It will require a change of company culture and investment in technology that will enable marketing teams to respond to events in a timely manner. More specifically, big brands must make social media–and the technology to analyze it–a priority. Social media experts are no longer “nice to have.” Brands need to employ teams dedicated to monitoring social media and developing relevant content in response to events in real time. Ultimately, they must be equipped with the tools they need to get the job done quickly. Using the right data to create layered audiences: It’s difficult to respond to every single piece of news or event quickly in a way that resonates with all audiences. The media landscape is too broad to assume that everyone in your database cares about everything that’s happening. Here is where companies must develop different personas or audiences using data and pinpoint the top segments that would be most effective to target with a certain message. Instead of wasting time and resources trying to target all groups of customers, you’re casting a wider data-driven net that is more likely to produce a response. Here is where brands can take advantage of the data resources available to them. For instance, first-party data, which is the brand’s own data, gives the opportunity to identify best customers. A brand can also look at its transactional data and get insights into the segments that are responsible for the most revenue. For example, an office-supply company might know, based on sales data, that its primary customers are small and midsized businesses in the U.S. But this is not enough. Brands should also turn to second- and third-party data to construct a more holistic profile of these segments. For instance, that same office-supply company can see that SMB segment’s larger digital footprint to determine that tech companies with fewer than 10 employees within it are most likely to respond to real-time content. Whatever approach the brand decides to take with its messaging, it must look for datasets that have a strong validation process in place when it comes to second- or third-party data to make sure the insights it does gain are accurate. Keeping messaging in line with the brand’s core mission: Big brands might try to do too much. It’s important to keep it simple and make sure messaging is consistent with the brand’s core mission. A brand can be agile and respond quickly, but if it’s off message, why bother? Keep in mind that you’re a brand with an agile marketing strategy, not a news outlet. You do not need to respond to every current event. Focus on those that really can be easily incorporated into your key messaging. If you’re the office-supply company, it might not make sense to incorporate real-time messaging about the Super Bowl. A catering company, however, could promote its services to companies within its target audience about hosting Super Bowl-themed events. Stick to what you know and what will relate back to your key messaging best. Today’s device-driven world calls for brands to be more spontaneous in their marketing endeavors. Sure, the basics of your marketing strategy can be planned out well in advance, but businesses today must equip themselves with the ability to respond to real-time B2B or B2C events to reach their audience during the small window of time they give you. Larger companies may face challenges operating in real time, but those that follow in these fundamental steps of smaller businesses will certainly see the benefits.

In a country where the economy is skyrocketing in multiple folds every minute, hygiene is often kept at the bay- leaving a vulnerable society. Amidst such a dispute, an MIT graduate Amrita Saigal along with her colleague Kristin Kagetsu came up with a sanitary pad made out of waste banana tree fibre. In this move, Amrita and Kristin are not only facilitating hygienic measures to rural women, but they’re also offering huge help to those who can’t afford the “elite” way. homegrown Amrita has been working on this model since 2012, while she was working with P&G. The product went through numerous trials and failures, but both the engineers worked until “Saathi” reached its final stage. This product is worthy of revolutionising Indian markets, where as much as 70% of women can’t afford sanitary napkins. A study also stated that ‘over 88% of women resort to shocking alternatives like unhygienic cloth, ashes and husk sand. The process of making Banana tree waste into a sanitary napkin It’s nearly revolting to know that as much as 23% of young women drop out of school when they start mensurating. Kristin, who has worked closely on the project says that she always wanted more women to stay in education and let mensuration not be an obstacle. Saathi's founding team along with Amrita and Kristin includes Grace Kane, who are all MIT graduates. homegrown Amrita is also an MBA from Harvard and she’s won an award for “Saathi” in a competition conducted by the university in the year 2014.  “Saathi has also won laurels such as the MIT DLab Scale-Ups Fellows for 2015 and the 3M-CII Young Innovators Challenge Social Track winner title,” stated a website. The pad is 100% eco-friendly and provides income generating opportunities to both the women as well as banana farmers based in Ahmedabad, says Kagetsu.  Saathi is launching their product with a #onemillionpad initiative in Jharkhand. They will distribute 1,000,000 pads to rural women in partnership with India's largest educational NGO, Ekal Vidyalaya. Starting in 2017, Saathi pads will be distributed nationwide.   2.6k facebook twitter reddit Comment Here ADVERTISEMENT Follow @indiatimes Next on Indiatimes Health: 12 Indian Instagrammers Who'll Give You Major Workout Goals Spotlight PARTNER These Horrifying Statistics Will Make You Join The Movement For A Diabetes Free India Kareena Thinks That Both Deepika Or Katrina, Weren't Good For Brother Ranbir Kapoor Rajinikanth Shared 2.0 Poster Featuring Akshay & Looks Like It's Going To Be One Hell Of A Film Trending Few Small Steps That Can Make Your Heart Healthier 6.4k Shares Husband In UAE Divorces Newly-Wed Wife After Seeing Her Without Makeup For The First Time! 10.2k Shares Drinking 8 Glasses Of Water Everyday?

I just kept telling myself to keep bowling the way I had been bowling in the first two games. Downing a couple of beers didn’t hurt either.” By Vicki PrevostPin Tales Last month, Gunner Sinagra, 22, of New Bedford, started the night in the Columbia 300 Summer Classic League at Wonder Bowl with back-to-back 289 games. As he began the final game, his mind was on the possibility of surpassing 800 for the first time in his career. “I was nervous, though,” he said. “I needed a 220-something to make it. I just kept telling myself to keep bowling the way I had been bowling in the first two games. Downing a couple of beers didn’t hurt either.” They certainly didn’t, as he ended the night with a 234 game and an 812 series. His teammates in that summer league were Alan Fisher and Steve Millette. “We have bowled together every summer for a few years,” he said. “They make bowling easier for me by giving me plenty of their age-old wisdom. I can use it, since I’m the young one on the team.” In the last game, while going for the 800 series, Millette gave him some great advice, which he heeded. “He told me to remember,” said Sinagra, “that the most important shot is the next shot. That advice took me all the way to the end of the night.” The right-handed bowler formerly had a 792 high series that he bowled last year. “I was close then,” he said. “It was only a matter of time, I figured, before I went over 800. I didn’t expect it to be this soon, though.” He has one 300 game that he bowled in the first game of the season last year in the Twilight League at Wonder Bowl. “I almost had another 300 game the first game this year, too,” he said. “A couple of weeks ago I bowled a 289 game. I seem to get a lot of those (he has had one 299, a 298 and a 290 also). My streak ended after the first game and I only bowled a 666 series that night.” His bowling career started at 6 years old in the Junior Program at Wonder Bowl. He stayed until he was 15, transferring to the adult leagues a lot sooner than most junior bowlers do. “I wasn’t enjoying the junior league,” Sinagra said. “I found the competition I needed in the adult leagues.” Since joining the adults, he has done much better, takes bowling more seriously and improving his average each year. He finished the winter season last year with a then-high 215 average and carried a 220 for the entire 13-week summer season. His goal for the 2016-17 season is to carry the 220 average and possibly higher for the 36-week season. “That might be difficult,” he said, “because for the first time, I’m only going to bowl one league (Twilight at Wonder Bowl) instead of the two or three that I usually bowl.” He is cutting back because of work, plus he figures his focus is better if he only bowls once a week. “If I bowl more than one league,” said Sinagra, “I’ll be sick of bowling by January.” In the meantime, he wants to bowl New England Bowling Association (NEBA) events each month and stay consistent. “Since I have both a 300 game and 800 series under my belt,” he said, “my next achievement would be to qualify for a NEBA final and eventually win a title.” Upcoming events The first monthly tournament in the P&G Bowling Tour is today at East Providence Lanes. Registration is at 9 a.m., competition begins at 10 a.m. Entry fee is $60. Today’s event will be bowled on the house shot. The Southeastern Mass. USBC Bowling Association’s Annual Awards Banquet is Oct. 15 at Holiday Lanes in Westport with cocktails at 6 p.m. Dinner is served at 7. Awards will be presented following dinner. After the awards presentation, there will be a tournament with a $10 fee. Banquet tickets are $25 per person and may be obtained from Stephanie Millward at 508-730-7715. Tickets are limited, please order early. Hall of Fame inductees will be honored, along with four Bowlers of the Year. If you bowled a 300 game and/or 800 series, you will be getting an award from the association, so you are invited to attend, as well as, women who bowled over 700 during the 2015-16 season. Highlights Del Picard Jr., in the Westport Trios League at Holiday Lanes in Westport, bowled a 300 game on September 6. In the same league, on the same night, Matt Rayner bowled an 800 series that included 279, 263 and 258 games. On a sad note: Irene Couto, who bowled in the Jolly Seniors (duckpin) League at Bowlmor Lanes in Mattapoisett, passed away during the summer hiatus (July 24). The league is saddened by her passing and she will be sorely missed.

cosmetic serum is usually a water-based, non-greasy, and intensive formula that contains a high concentration of active substances. Serums can also be oil-based but have an oil-free texture (owing to less concentration of oil in the formulation). The oil-free texture can help them to penetrate deeper. Serums get rapidly absorbed and have the ability to penetrate into deeper layers, together with its active ingredients, to moisturize and deliver added nutrients. Serums contain high concentrations of active ingredients, so are usually made to contain just a few active ingredients. Due to high concentrations of active ingredients, serums produce the desired results faster than other creams or similar products.

    Home | About | Archives | Sponsorship | Contact Us | Submit / Suggest            CHEP & IFCO Named By Kroger As Key Component Of 2020 Zero Waste Strategy by CHEP and IFCO Posted: Tuesday, September 20, 2016 at 3:13PM EDT Atlanta, GA –  CHEP and IFCO, member companies of the Brambles Group, announced the companies’ shared pallets and bulk containers and Reusable Plastic Containers (RPCs) have been identified by Kroger[1] as critical to reducing waste in the company’s supply chain. The nation’s second largest retailer highlighted CHEP and IFCO in its 2016 Sustainability Report. By replacing more single-use packaging and platforms with reusables, Kroger aims to meet or exceed the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s zero waste threshold of 90% diversion from landfill in its facilities by 2020. “Kroger is committed to being a positive force for change when it comes to sustainable business practices, and CHEP and IFCO play an important role in our effort to meet our zero waste goals and continuously improve the sustainability of our supply chain,” said Suzanne Walker-Lindsay, Kroger Director of Sustainability. Kroger’s sustainability report states, “Kroger partners with CHEP and IFCO, which both contribute to global sustainability through their ‘shared’ business models of pooled pallets, bulk containers and reusable plastic containers (RPCs). These packaging solutions bring both operational efficiencies and environmental benefits. Compared with one-way packaging, reusable platforms and containers offer a lower carbon footprint, reduced water consumption and less waste.” In addition, Kroger notes its use of RPCs for fresh produce improved product quality and reduced waste by eliminating the use of more than 73,000 tons of waxed and corrugated boxes. “We are committed to providing our customers with sustainable solutions that help them make their supply chains more efficient and environmentally friendly,” said Juan Jose Freijo, Global Head of Sustainability for Brambles. “Kroger is a valuable partner and we are pleased to contribute to their zero waste vision. Those companies working together on common goals will be the ones with the greatest impact on environmental sustainability.” CHEP and IFCO supply chain solutions provide clear environmental benefits versus alternatives. For example, Kroger’s commitment to CHEP pallets avoided more than one million pounds of solid waste and eliminated 430 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2e), the equivalent of growing more than 41,000 trees for 10 years.[2]  Separately, production of IFCO RPCs requires 65% less water and 34% less energy than one-way packaging. In addition, the use of IFCO RPCs results in a 31% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and an 85% reduction in solid waste versus single-use cardboard boxes.[3] Kroger, CHEP and IFCO are also members of the Consumer Goods Forum, whose members have committed to reducing food waste by half within retail and manufacturing operations by 2025, while also contributing to the United Nation’s 2030 food waste reduction goals. Mr. Freijo concluded, “We look forward to continuing our partnership with Kroger and other retailers and manufacturers to reduce the environmental impact of the fast-moving consumer goods supply chain and to help preserve our natural resources for future generations.” [1] National Retail Federation, 2015. 2 CHEP Sustainability Calculator. 3 Comparative Life Cycle Assessment of Reusable Plastic Containers and Display- and Non-Display-Ready Corrugated Containers Used for Fresh Produce Applications, Franklin Associates, March 2016  ### About CHEP and IFCO: CHEP is a global provider of supply chain solutions serving the consumer goods, fresh food, beverage, manufacturing and retail sectors in more than 60 countries.

Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock Is Screeching to a Halt The 7 Best Tech Stocks in the World View All Posts Whenever Mark Cuban gives an interview, you’ll always be entertained. He’ll inevitably say something controversial — yet insightful. But then again, Cuban is a true American super entrepreneur. During the dot-com heyday, he sold Broadcast.com to Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) for a cool $5.7 billion. From there, he invested in other ventures — and, of course, bought the 2010-11 NBA champion Dallas Mavericks. As of now, Cuban now has a net worth of about $2.5 billion. In a recent talk with The Wall Street Journal, he — as expected — did not pull any punches. First of all, he took shots at the concept “buy and hold.” According to Cuban, it’s a good way to waste your hard-earned money. In an era of high-frequency trading, investing looks more like a casino, right? Cuban also thinks the more sophisticated idea of “asset allocation” is another big loser. This is a fancy way to divide your assets across stocks, bonds, commodities and other categories — with the goal of getting diversification. But in a global marketplace, securities prices actually have become more correlated, making it tougher to reduce the overall risk in a portfolio. So what does Cuban recommend? In a sense, it is about going back to the principles of legendary investor Peter Lynch. That is, you should invest in companies you really understand. Often this means avoiding high-fliers like LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) and Pandora (NYSE:P) and instead focusing on stalwarts like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Proctor & Gamble (NYSE:PG). However, Cuban always wants to get things at dirt-cheap prices. To this end, he still is waiting for the market to dip even more. As should be expected, Cuban’s words have stirred up some crumbling from Wall Street power players. Just take a look at John Bogle, founder of The Vanguard Group. Basically, he thinks Cuban’s investment ideas are, well, dangerous. Bogle is a firm believer in the idea that investing is about looking to the long haul. And yes, this means divvying up assets across different categories. Let’s face it, can the regular investor effectively time the market? Is it possible to take on the world’s top hedge fund managers? Probably not. So while asset allocation is far from perfect, it still is a pretty good strategy. Despite all this, Cuban’s views still are worth noting. That is, there still are great opportunities to buy stocks that ultimately might become the next Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) or Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). But again, it means truly understanding the company’s products and competitive advantages — as well as the long-term growth potential. Tom Taulli is the author of “All About Short Selling” and “All About Commodities.” You can also find him at Twitter account @ttaulli. He does not own a position in any of the stocks named here.

When pseudo-logic is everywhere, emotion is what breaks through Sep 20, 2016 Bruce Philp   (Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty) Baseless provocation has become big business in politics lately—take Brexit and the improbable candidacy of Donald Trump for two particularly vivid examples—and, if they have any sense, marketers are taking notes. The Donald has proven to have a particularly sick genius for whipping up a crowd, with his trademark mix of belligerent non sequitur and naked pandering. Its appeal doesn’t seem broad enough to get him elected, but it’s certainly enough to make people pay attention, and that’s a hot commodity these days. Donald Trump's anti-trade rhetoric exposes deep rifts in the global economy Pundits now anguish over our “post-factual democracy,” in which people’s politics aren’t rooted in principle anymore. If voters aren’t being even slightly cerebral about the destinies of nations, will they be any more so when it comes to toothpaste and canned soup? That may seem like a leap, but brands have fed on the zeitgeist since forever. Ad people like to believe that they create the public’s tastes and moods (when they’re not “disrupting” them), but it’s usually more a matter of paddling around on their intellectual surf boards, searching for a cultural wave they can profitably ride to the beach. These days, though, maybe for the first time ever, they’re plying the wrong ocean. While keynote speakers bluster about awesome products, and smug digerati busily codify consumer behaviour, those very consumers are developing an antagonistic distrust of objectivity, or what passes for it. We’re competing in emotional times, now, and reason has become obsolete. Though the debate over emotional versus rational advertising is as old as the martini, rationality’s days have been numbered for some time. Its origins are found in the industrial age, when the whole of corporate might was thrown at finding new consumer problems to solve. But socks can only get so white, and cabs only so easy to hail. It’s inevitable that consumers would turn their attention to more profound themes when it came to choosing brands. Marketers should have been ready for that, but nobody was ready for today’s seething frustration. This isn’t evolution, it’s insurrection. Finding it increasingly difficult to distinguish between nuance and prevarication, people are raging against even having to try. Nobler minds can ponder what this means for democracy—but marketers should still be paying attention. If there’s no distinction between claims and lies anymore, then the only truth people will trust is the one they feel. And they’ll soon bring that bias to the mall, not just the voting booth. Consider: 20 years ago, the ad campaign judged most effective in America was about the perils of switching dog food. This year, it was moms advocating for gun control. Canada’s effectiveness champ two decades ago was a new flavour of mouthwash; this year, that same gun control–campaign shared top honours with P&G, which turned buying feminine hygiene products into an act of political defiance. When pseudo-logic is everywhere, feelings are what break through. How a crisis of morality is slowly killing marketing Turning a brand into a social cause is risky business. Most corporations are already short on moral authority, even before you add in the profit motive. But this is a good moment to look up from our spreadsheets and remember that consumers are human. It’s easy to criticize people for abandoning reason and making choices from the heart, especially if those choices seem bonkers. They’re not fools, though; they’ve simply fallen back on ancient instinct to cope with an over-marketed, amoral world. Which means that, if we’re not careful, claims-based advertising (30% more peanuts in every bite!) can inadvertently make things worse instead of winning people over. Ads are supposed to provoke. Even if your snack food is never going to save the world, it’s no longer an option to ignore how consumers feel about where it fits in their lives, or how they want it to. It’s no longer an option to be indifferent to their vanities, their insecurities, or their aspirations, because those things may be the last, best way to earn their attention. To coin a phrase, if we want to make advertising great again, we need to get more empathetic, not more clever.

At 14:15 IST, the barometer index, the S&P BSE Sensex was down 127.68 points or 0.45% at 28,506.82. The Nifty 50 index was currently down 46.40 points or 0.53% at 8,762. Weakness in global stocks weighed on sentiment on the domestic bourses. The Sensex lost 153.97 points or 0.53% at the day's low of 28,480.53 in mid-afternoon trade, its lowest level since 15 September 2016. The barometer index rose 64.31 points or 0.22% at the day's high of 28,698.81 at the onset of trading session.

The index rose 8.05 points or 0.09% at the day's high of 8,816.45 at the onset of trading session. In overseas stock markets, European and Asian stocks edged lower as investors awaited the outcomes of separate policy meetings of the US Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan (BOJ). The BOJ begins a two-day monetary policy meeting today, 20 September 2016. The central bank will conduct a comprehensive review of its stimulus programme after failing to reach its 2% inflation target. Investors are divided on what steps the central bank will take. Some expect that the BOJ will push back additional easing steps, while making its government bond buying more flexible to steepen the yield curve. Others expect the BOJ to launch fresh stimulus through a further push into negative territory and increased asset purchases. The central bank had kept its pledge to increase the monetary base at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen and left the interest rate unchanged at minus 0.1% at its July 2016 meeting. Policymakers also decided to increase the annual exchange-traded equity funds purchase target to 6 trillion yen from the previous 3.3 trillion yen. US stocks registered tiny losses yesterday, 19 September 2016, after a choppy session, with telecommunications shares lagging. The US Federal Reserve policy makers begin their two-day policy meeting today, 20 September 2016. The Fed is expected to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged in the wake of recent downbeat US economic indicators. The Fed left the target range for its federal funds rate unchanged at 0.25% to 0.5% for the fifth time during its July 2016 meeting.

Being married to an ex-banker, however, meant considerable travel and breaks in her career (Ms Shah happens to be the spouse of Manish Shah, co-founder and CEO of BigDecisions.com, a company owned by News Corp, which is also the owner of the publisher of VCCircle.com). In her experiences as a mother living abroad, the baby centre she went to did not cater to the needs of Indian mothers. That’s where the idea for First Moms Club (FMC) came about. The idea behind setting up the community was to enable Indian mothers to connect back to their roots. “I found a lot of small town moms, and moms abroad who wanted to connect with being Indian,” explained Shah. While the small town mothers wanted to know what was happening in the metros, the NRI moms wanted to go back to their roots. “It grew organically. When the community grew very large, I realised there was a lot of potential,” she added. Established in 2010, FMC started out as a community on Facebook with 20 members and has till date added 50,000 users on the platform. FMC launched the beta version of its app on the Google Play Store and the App Store in April this year, which has garnered 5,000 downloads, so far. The app’s open market release is set for early October. “FMC stands out from the other communities. It is not a parenting website or a blog, where it’s a one way traffic, like a panel of experts or blogger telling users what to do. It’s a platform for women to come together and (share their experiences),” said the former Mudra Communications executive. Besides an online community, FMC engages with mothers offline by organising events. It had its first event in 2014 called Momentum on International Women’s Day, and has also organised a children’s literature festival. Besides such gatherings, it also organises bazaars where women entrepreneurs can sell their wares. One of the platform’s main features is a corner where women can share any problems they are facing, anonymously. Here, they speak about medical issues, problems with mothers-in-law, career decisions, how to deal with family situations and even serious issues on domestic violence and child sexual abuse. Ruchita Dar Shah developed First Moms Club from just a Facebook community in 2010 to a full-fledged networking site for mothers FMC, operated by Ruchita Rambles Services Pvt. Ltd, relies on brand partnerships as it main source of monetisation. The platform has done promotional campaigns for brands such as Huggies and Pampers, “Sometimes the promo is for the launch of a new product or for mompreneurs and small businesses. Conventional advertising is expensive. Communities become a cheaper way to reach the mother,” explained Shah. The venture is set to receive its first round of funding and will focus on partnering more with brands. FMC will also become a platform for brands to conduct their research. “We did this thing with Huggies where they came out with a product and we sent it out to 20 mothers on our community and then got feedback. There was a GPS tracker for kids and we did a contest. The mothers tried it out for three weeks and gave feedback,” explained Shah. Such initiatives have been successful for brands because they get real feedback from their consumer base. Besides brands, FMC is exploring monetisation streams through user-generated video, a loyalty programme for mothers, where they will receive benefits and discounts, and also launch e-books. Four years ago, FMC tied up with an NGO AngelXpress for a toy donation drive for the children. The firm is now in the process of tying up with Mattel to provide a toy for each child. Other players in the space include mycity4kids, Tiny Step and Baby Chakra to name a few. Mycity4kids is a content platform that helps mothers discover resources and events for their children and also connects users with mommy bloggers and parenting experts. Its main revenue stream is that of brand tie-ups through sponsored content on its website. Baby Chakra, founded in 2014 provides listings around baby activities such as events, playschools, day care centres, wellness activities and education in various packages. It monetises through commissions from online marketplaces such as Amazon and Flipkart for transactions carried out through the Baby Chakra portal. Like this report?

At the entrance, there’s a display of small cardboard bins filled with $1 playthings that look messy, and even worse -- cheap. “It kind of reminds me of a garage sale,” says Brandon, who became chief executive officer of the world’s biggest toy chain 14 months ago. “We’re not the dollar shop. We’re a toy store.” In the Star Wars section nearby, a Chewbacca chair has tumbled over into the aisle. The 64-year-old CEO grabs it and turns it right-side up. Dressed in black pants and a blue long-sleeve shirt -- a deliberate attempt to connect with store workers by wearing their uniform -- Brandon then walks through a display of Pokemon toys, snapping pictures of empty shelves with his iPhone that he’ll send to one of his executives. It’s Friday afternoon before the crucial weekend rush. “This doesn’t make me happy,” says Brandon, who estimates that he’s been to 200 stores since taking the reins in July 2015. There hasn’t been much to smile about at Toys “R” Us Inc. More than a decade after a $7.5 billion leveraged buyout by Bain Capital, KKR & Co. and Vornado Realty Trust, the retailer remains saddled with annual interest payments approaching $500 million and no clear path for its owners to exit the investment. The company registered for an initial public offering in 2010, only to withdraw it a few years later. Since the buyout, Amazon.com, which once ran the Toys “R” Us website, has become a powerful competitor. And shoppers are abandoning the suburban malls that helped make the big-box pioneer one of the most dominant retailers of the 1980s and 1990s. Brandon, who oversaw a turnaround at Domino’s Pizza last decade, knows he has no easy task. For years, the Wayne, New Jersey-based toy chain has bought time by refinancing its debt, which now totals about $5 billion. It did so again last month with a swap that pushed out maturities on notes due in 2017 and 2018 by five years. While Brandon’s first year has brought signs of progress, with holiday sales gaining for the first time in four years, the  deal wasn’t necessarily a full vote of confidence because many investors had bought the bonds at distressed levels and made a profit. But it did buy Brandon more time -- probably the next two Christmas seasons -- to turn the company around. Empty Shelves Back in the Secaucus store, Brandon is looking over several empty shelves. He ticks off a list of retail basics, such as improved inventory management, that are sorely needed. Then he boils down the company’s woes to one fundamental problem: The experience needs to be more fun. The big-box advantages of selection and price that made the format so successful have been obliterated by the web. There needs to be more reasons for people to go to a store. “The biggest change you are going to see over the next year is that we want to bring our toy stores to life,” Brandon says. “I want kids to be dragging their parents to our stores because they want to see what’s going on at Toys ‘R’ Us this weekend.” How well Brandon’s strategy works may say a lot about the future of specialty retailing. If any big-box chain can transform itself into an experiential destination, it’s Toys “R” Us. The retailer has a huge inherent advantage -- kids already love the place. It will be a massive undertaking. The company has almost 600 stores in the U.S. and 700 more overseas. It still racks up almost $12 billion in annual sales -- about 10 percent from the internet -- and employs 62,000 workers. The retailer generates more revenue than Under Armour Inc., Lululemon Athletica Inc. and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. combined. Drone Flying Brandon’s plan is already under way in the run-up to the holiday season, when the retailer generates 40 percent of its revenue and all its operating income. Whether it’s letting shoppers fly  drones or take target practice with a Nerf blaster, all the changes Toys “R” Us is implementing or considering recall an era when retail was more theater than science. Apple is doing it well today, and Brandon says Toys “R” Us can do the same. The company is also testing video screens, sound effects and colorful motion-sensor lights, and unboxing more toys in play areas. It’s also hosting more events, such as Pokemon trading and birthday celebrations. “I want kids to come in here and not know where to go next because there are so many things going on,” says Brandon, who has seven young grandchildren. Toys “R” Us is also doing more to highlight major brands. Mattel Inc.’s American Girl will have its own department with dedicated staff. The chain is revamping how it treats Barbie, Mattel’s biggest line, by putting everything it sells for the brand -- from clothing to toys to electronics -- in one place. The retailer used a similar strategy last Christmas for Star Wars. Cash has been a concern since the 2005 buyout, making it harder for Toys “R” Us to invest in its stores. Brandon says the retailer has the resources it needs and will keep capital expenditures where they’ve been, at about $250 million a year. In addition to the swap, Toys “R” Us is working with lenders on refinancing $725 million in real estate-backed debt due in December 2017. The company has bought itself about 20 months before it needs to have a plan in place for $1.2 billion in loans due in 2019, according to Noel Hebert, a senior U.S. credit analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Familiar Scenario Brandon has been in a similar spot before. In 1999, he became CEO of debt-laden Domino’s, which had recently been acquired by Bain for about $900 million. In an 11-year reign, he took the company public after boosting sales and profit, and led a bold and successful marketing campaign in 2009 that admitted that Domino’s pizza tasted awful. The company, where Brandon remains chairman, currently has a market value of $7 billion. Now Bain Capital has turned to Brandon once again. Joining Toys “R” Us returns the executive to running a large company and gives him a chance at redemption after a rocky tenure in his most-recent stint. In the early 1970s, Brandon played on the defensive line for the University of Michigan football team under legendary football coach Bo Schembechler. It was Schembechler who then served as a reference for Brandon when he landed a job after graduation at Procter & Gamble Co. After Domino’s, he returned to his alma mater as athletic director in 2010. In one of the few setbacks of his career, Brandon resigned less than four years later amid a string of bad publicity, including raising student ticket prices. At one point, students rallied for Brandon’s firing. At Toys “R” Us, Brandon’s growth plan includes obvious strategies like boosting online sales, which hit $1.3 billion last year. He also wants to open more stores. And not just in a fast-growing economy like China, but also in the U.S. with smaller locations -- some about a quarter the size of a typical 40,000-square-foot unit -- designed for New York and other cities that it abandoned because of high rent. “When it comes to all those millennials who want to live in those urban centers, we’re nowhere,” Brandon says. So far, the chain’s suppliers are on board, says Isaac Larian, the CEO and founder of toymaker MGA Entertainment Inc. Early on, Brandon made the rounds visiting manufacturers and impressed Larian with a willingness to hear the unvarnished truth about the retailer. “He’s not a B.S. type of guy,” said Larian, whose company is best known for its Bratz dolls. “He doesn’t have a big ego.” Toymakers, of course, have every reason to be rooting for him. The nightmare scenario is that if Toys “R” Us fails, MGA and larger competitors like Mattel and Hasbro would be left at the mercy of mass merchants like Wal-Mart and Amazon, which drive down prices. “The toy business needs to have an anchor in the mind of the consumer,” Larian said. “If no Toys ‘R’ Us, no toy business.” --With assistance from Jodi Xu Klein.

Benett/Getty Images for Charlotte Tilbury Makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury taught Kim Kardashian to sleep in her makeup. It’s a trick she’s picked up herself, as “she has never let her husband see her without makeup on,” which Kardashian said of Tilbury, calling her “my hero.” The creator of a beauty line loved by celebrity makeup artists and celebrities (she did the wedding-day makeup for Kate Moss and Amal Clooney), Tilbury is also making her foray into fragrance with her first perfume, Scent of a Dream. To celebrate the fragrance, Tilbury recently released a 360 degree film starring Kate Moss, her children’s godmother. Here, she talked to the Cut about how she really does sleep in her makeup and her unapologetic belief that makeup is happiness. Makeup artists always tell you not to sleep in your makeup, but you’ve talked about how you do sleep in your makeup. Is it really true? It’s true. I always have a bedroom eye. I clean my skin, put my Magic Night Rescue Cream on, my Magic Eye Rescue, and then Wonderglow — it softens everything. But I take off all my eye makeup, and then I reapply it. I put on my eyeliner in Audrey, and then I put a little bit of mascara on my top lashes, and then that’s it. I always say it’s my bedroom eye because it just makes me feel sexy. Have you always done that? Always. Always. Always. Forever. At 13, I understood the power of makeup and the way it changed my life. I understood how you could feel so empowered, confident, and amazing when you looked in the mirror and felt great about loving the way you look. I feel really great, and I don’t look tired, and I don’t look exhausted, and my eyes don’t look small, they look big. Makeup is happiness. There was a recent study where they took some scruffier counterparts, then made them over with hair and their makeup. With that, they found they earned 70 percent — seven-zero percent — more. It was a 15-year study [Editor’s Note: Tilbury might be referring to this study, although it doesn’t cite a 70 percent increase]. There is another study by Procter and Gamble that I saw that cited a 30 percent increase. In the social-media age, what are your tips for looking photogenic? Makeup. The reason that, on photo shoots, people wear makeup is because they need it. Your features can become more washed-out. They can disappear, so you need that to enhance. Some of the top things all the celebrities use is the Filmstar Bronze & Glow and the Magic Foundation. Filmstar Bronze and Glow is a key, key product. It plays with the light on top of the cheekbones, and then you can contour your face because sometimes you can look quite flat and wide on camera. Magic foundation is the most incredible HD foundation. It fills in your pores. It smooths out your pores. It shrinks your pores. And then, there’s Supermodel Body — which is literally “supermodel body.” That was created for the Victoria’s Secret fashion shows, and celebrities send me pictures all the time being like, Look at my legs with Supermodel Body. It’s key on the red carpet because often, you have these gorgeous glowing faces and then when you put moisturizer onto the skin, it quite often sinks in. Alicia Keys wore no makeup to the VMAs and while there was some praise, there was also some backlash. What are your thoughts on people who say that makeup is a mask? Makeup is not a mask. There’s not a human being in the world that doesn’t look better with makeup. It might be a little bit of makeup or it might be a lot of makeup. It depends. It depends on the individual, their features, and how much they can take. Anyone, even Gisele Bündchen, who is the kind of girl who wakes up looking good, even she looks great with just a little bit of makeup. I totally disagree. They just haven’t discovered how makeup can enhance your assets and make you look like the most beautiful version of you. In a perfect world, we would all wake up looking like we had perfectly filled in lashes, perfectly skin, but that’s just not reality. This interview has been condensed and edited.

At the entrance, there’s a display of small cardboard bins filled with $1 playthings that look messy, and even worse—cheap. “It kind of reminds me of a garage sale,” says Brandon, who became chief executive of the world’s biggest toy chain 14 months ago. “We’re not the dollar shop. We’re a toy store.” In the Star Wars section nearby, a Chewbacca chair has tumbled over into the aisle. The 64-year-old CEO grabs it and turns it right-side up. Dressed in black pants and a blue long-sleeve shirt—a deliberate attempt to connect with store workers by wearing their uniform—Brandon then walks through a display of Pokemon toys, snapping pictures of empty shelves with his iPhone that he’ll send to one of his executives. It’s Friday afternoon before the crucial weekend rush. “This doesn’t make me happy,” says Brandon, who estimates that he’s been to 200 stores since taking the reins in July 2015. There hasn’t been much to smile about at Toys “R” Us Inc. More than a decade after a $7.5 billion leveraged buyout by Bain Capital, KKR & Co. and Vornado Realty Trust, the retailer remains saddled with annual interest payments of more than $400 million and no clear path for its owners to exit the investment. The company has about 600 stores in the United States, including three Toys R Us stores and three Babies R Us stores in Indianapolis. The company registered for an initial public offering in 2010, only to withdraw it a few years later. Since the buyout, Amazon.com, which once ran the Toys “R” Us website, has become a powerful competitor. And shoppers are abandoning the suburban malls that helped make the big-box pioneer one of the most dominant retailers of the 1980s and 1990s. Brandon, who oversaw a turnaround at Domino’s Pizza last decade, knows he has no easy task. For years, the Wayne, New Jersey-based toy chain has bought time by refinancing its debt, which now totals about $5 billion. It did so again last month with a swap that pushed out maturities on notes due in 2017 and 2018 by five years. While Brandon’s first year has brought signs of progress, with holiday sales gaining for the first time in four years, the  deal wasn’t necessarily a full vote of confidence because many investors had bought the bonds at distressed levels and made a profit. But it did buy Brandon more time — probably the next two Christmas seasons—to turn the company around. Empty shelves Back in the Secaucus store, Brandon is looking over several empty shelves. He ticks off a list of retail basics, such as improved inventory management, that are sorely needed. Then he boils down the company’s woes to one fundamental problem: The experience needs to be more fun. The big-box advantages of selection and price that made the format so successful have been obliterated by the web. There needs to be more reasons for people to go to a store. “The biggest change you are going to see over the next year is that we want to bring our toy stores to life,” Brandon says. “I want kids to be dragging their parents to our stores because they want to see what’s going on at Toys ‘R’ Us this weekend.” How well Brandon’s strategy works may say a lot about the future of specialty retailing.

Apple is doing it well today, and Brandon says Toys “R” Us can do the same. The company is also testing video screens, sound effects and colorful motion-sensor lights, and unboxing more toys in play areas.

MARKETING 3 Tricks to Getting Your Social Video to go Viral A few hundred views isn't worth any company's time or money. Here's how to have the best chance at getting millions upon millions of views.

But a few hundred views isn't worth any company's time or money. Rather, you want millions upon millions of views and if done right, any brand should be able to pull it off. That's according to Jim Rudden, CMO of Spredfast, a an enterprise social media marketing platform helping companies including Airbnb, Best Buy, Hyundai and Target manage audience experiences and monitor brand engagement on social. Here are the things he says you need to remember if you want your social videos to go viral. 1. Think about what your competitors are not doing. With so many companies using social networks as a marketing channel, repetition is everywhere. Considering what your audience is seeing in its news feed every day, the question you should ask is, "What would be a different approach?" If you don't surprise people, you won't get the views and shares you're after. 2. Understand the three things people like to share. First, if your followers believe in something you stand for, create content around that topic. Second, share interesting information such as a unique point of view or surprising data from research. Third, post content that people will connect with emotionally. Not sure what that looks like? Check out Procter & Gamble's "Thank you, Mom" series. 3. Understand the quirks of the channel you're using. You need to know, for example, that any video on Facebook will launch with the sound off. If your compelling message depends on sound, you'll need to employ some kind of textual cue to get viewers to turn on the volume. On Snapchat, it's the opposite and until a viewer turns off the sound at least the first couple of seconds of voice or music will be heard. "You [can't] produce video once and reuse it everywhere," he says. "If you want success or virality on social in general and specifically across platforms, then you really have to be mindful of platform nuances."

Political Reporter For Dailymail.com In New York, Ny Published: 17:36 EST, 20 September 2016 | Updated: 19:02 EST, 20 September 2016 e-mail 200 shares 154 View comments He hailed it as 'transparent' and spoke about how the Clinton Global Initiative was simply misunderstood. But Bill Clinton’s attempts to make his controversial get-together in New York seem like an exercise in openness suffered a blow as details of how reporters are restricted from asking questions were revealed on Tuesday. DailyMail.com, which is among the organizations attending the event, was told that its most controversial dinner was off-limits to the press. Scroll down for video   NO QUESTIONS: Neither Bill Clinton nor Chelsea Clinton have hosted a press conference, nor did they walk a red carpet, where journalists had limited access to special guests  One of the basement rooms where reporters are being kept is ready for a press conference, but neither Bill nor Chelsea Clinton have hosted one  That is only one of the draconian restrictions on reporters at the event, which is not holding a press conference. Bill Clinton has answered questions only in specially-arranged interviews, and Chelsea Clinton has answered none at all.  On Tuesday the ex-president used one of two television interviews he has given, with CNBC's Becky Quick, to boast of his charity that it 'put it all out there'. But in reality, neither Clinton has taken a single question from a journalist during or between the CGI's sessions. They did not even walk the red carpet, where reporters could ask a limited number of questions Monday night. Reporters are kept in a basement room between 'plenary sessions' and can only go upstairs if they're chaperoned by a press handler, who put them in roped off areas away from the delegates.   Journalists are barred from entering the confab's specialty lounges, with a staff member standing guard at the door making sure no yellow press badges enter.  The press area includes a press conference room, but no press conferences had been scheduled as of the conclusion of day No. 2.  In years past, celebrities and Bill Clinton himself have come downstairs, answered questions and greeted press.  Rocker Jon Bon Jovi, pictured walking the Clinton Global Initiative's 'blue' carpet, refused to address the criticism being lobbed at the Clinton Foundation or talk about the election. Bill and Chelsea refused to go near the red carpet. Last night, guests were treated to an open bar, while reporters were herded between the press area and an awards ceremony  Clinton Global Initiative attendees had the option to sip red or white wine from sippy cups as they watched an awards program, where press was corralled  When DailyMail.com tried to ask one of the biggest stars at the event, the aging rocker Jon Bon Jovi, about Donald Trump and Republicans' criticism of the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative his handler, and then the singer himself, shut it down.  'We'll move on to the next question,' Bon Jovi's handler told Dailymail.com.  'I'm not here for that,' the rock star said. 'Good try though.' When a foreign reporter asked a follow-up, Bon Jovi also refused to respond.   Of the four dinners taking place in New York City on Tuesday night as part of CGI, the press are banned from three. One of the dinners became news on Tuesday when Donald Trump's campaign and Republicans took issue with one of the speakers, Palestinian teacher Hanan al-Hroub, whose husband was convicted of a terror attack that killed six Israelis in 1980.  Trump's campaign called it 'deeply disturbing,' which was was echoed by the Republican National Committee's Raj Shah. Don't ask, she won't tell: Chelsea Clinton has answered precisely zero questions from journalists despite her father claiming the organization is 'transparent' RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next It's Bill's Party!

Share this article Share 200 shares 'In the wake of this weekend's attacks, granting a platform to the spouse of a terrorist bomb-maker just miles away from where explosives were detonated days ago is an insult to the victims and makes a mockery of the Clinton Foundation,' Shah said in a statement to the Wall Street Journal.  Dailymail.com was told that the dinner was closed to the press - and the Clinton Global Initiative blamed the dinner's sponsor for the secrecy.  'Topic Dinners are hosted by CGI sponsors; they are not usually open to press, except at the discretion of the host organization,' explained a staffer for CGI.  The sponsor in this case is the Varkey Foundation, which is a charity run by Sunny Varkey, who founded and is the owner of GEMS, a chain of private schools around the world. GEMS paid Bill Clinton $5.6 million, which started after he was named honorary chairman of the Varkey Foundation, then known as the Varkey GEMS Foundaiton. DailyMail.com asked about press access at CGI overall and is still waiting for a response. Journalists are also banned from covering a Procter & Gamble-sponsored dinner featuring Chelsea Clinton and former Talk magazine editor Tina Brown entitled, 'Tackling Gender Bias in the Media Through the Power of Advertising.' Procter & Gamble has yet to respond to a request for comment.   The restrictions make an apparent mockery of Bill Clinton’s claim that his charity is as transparent as possible.  But they're not a new part of covering the Clinton Global Initiative. Two years ago, the New York Times' Amy Chozick memorably recalled being escorted to the ladies' room by a 20-something press aide.  'She waited outside the stall in the ladies’ room at the Sheraton Hotel, where the conference is held each year,' Chozick wrote of the flack.  This year reporters can find the bathroom on their own - but only if they go solely to the bathroom and do not dare to try to access other areas. 'Lounges' for other guests are off-limits and DailyMail.com was refused entry to one. Read more: www.nytimes.com/...

WIRE How Airbnb Is Helping the Clinton Foundation Break the Glass Ceiling The foundation plans to invest more than $70 million in women, and Airbnb is pitching in with free lodgings. By Tess Townsend Tess Townsend reports on tech and startups for the San Francisco bureau of Inc. She previously reported for The Day, an independent regional paper in Connecticut. Her work has appeared in The New York Times, Politico, and the now-defunct Bay Citizen. @Tess_Townsend Staff reporter, Inc.com@Tess_Townsend WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Women are healthier and better educated than they used to be, but somehow that hasn't translated into the expected surge of economic progress. That's according to a recent report by the Clinton Foundation, as cited by Fortune. The magazine reports the foundation is partnering with 20 businesses and nonprofits and investing $70 million in women in a bid to close that gap. The foundation anticipates efforts will impact more than 900,000 people in 60 countries, according to Fortune. One of the businesses involved in the initiative is Airbnb, which is offering free accommodations through the platform to 160 small business owners and activists who are women. The idea is that covering these accommodation costs will make it easier for these women to attend conferences and networking events that can help them advance their careers. It's about the hosts, too. Female hosts in some parts of the world are disproportionately entrepreneurial. "Airbnb execs have found that women hosts tend to re-invest the money they earn from hosting guests to start small businesses, schools, and training programs for other entrepreneurs," states Fortune. Other companies involved in the initiative with the Clinton Foundation include P&G and Unilever. Also part of the project: nonprofit Catalyst plans to start an annual list of women deemed prime to serve as directors of boards of U.S. corporations. Published on: Sep 20, 2016 Advertisement

L'Oreal USA's Matrix Oil Wonders folding carton   Spread the Word: News By Tag: * Folding Cartons * Packaging * Awards By Industry: * ManufacturingROCHESTER, N.Y. - Sept. 20, 2016 - PRLog -- Printing Impressions magazine announced that Diamond Packaging won three awards in the 29th annual Gold Ink Awards competition, the industry's most prestigious print competition. Winners were chosen from nearly 1,000 entries submitted within 50 different categories. Entries were judged on print quality, technical difficulty, and overall visual effect. Diamond won a Pewter Award in the "Calendars" category for its 2016 calendar, which marks the 25th anniversary of a long-standing company tradition. The grandfather clock theme, with its inner mechanisms perfectly balanced, represents the collaborative and precise nature of Diamond's work. The calendar was converted utilizing Clearwater Paper Candesce® SBS paperboard and offset printed with four color process inks, UV matte coating, and UV gloss spot coating. The dimensional header features a multi-level embossed and debossed woodgrain pattern, and a striking clock face insert enhanced with UV gloss spot coating, cold foil, and multi-level embossing, creating a dramatic sense of texture and depth. It also incorporates an opening APET rigid window panel and foil embossed chimes that artfully simulate a real grandfather clock. The middle backers also feature a multi-level embossed woodgrain pattern, and three unique sets of foil embossed gears enhanced with UV gloss spot coating. Metal Magic provided all of the embossing dies. The tightly-registered foil accents, which lend authenticity to the piece, were achieved using state-of-the-art, in-line cold foiling technology. They also showcase the type of decorative effects that can cost-effectively elevate customers' brands. Diamond won a Pewter Award in the "Folding Cartons" category for Elizabeth Arden's 5th Avenue Only NYC carton. The carton was converted utilizing metallized polyester board and printed with UV flexo fuchsia purple, dense black, and opaque white offset inks, in-line with DiamondTouch soft touch coating, UV matte, and UV gloss spot coating. High gloss embossed accents on the front panel provide a stunning contrast to the interlaced matte and spot UV gloss pattern surrounding it. The combination of color and textures reinforces 5th Avenue as a prestige brand, and beautifully complements the primary container – a glass bottle with tall clean lines, purple color palette, and gold infused cap. Diamond won a Pewter Award in the "Folding Cartons" category for L'Oreal USA's Matrix Oil Wonders promotional packaging. The carton was converted utilizing KapStone Kraftpak® high-yield, low density paperboard and printed with UV flexo white, opaque white, four color process, and dense black inks, in-line with UV varnish. Printed opaque white dots provide a perfect counterpoint to the brilliant gold foil stamped dots, creating dimension and visual interest. Gold foil surrounds the die cut windows, framing the hair care products within and drawing attention to the free product sample inside. The interplay between the unbleached paperboard and foil accents create shimmering metallic effects that are very unusual for a kraft-type folding carton. All of Diamond's winning entries were manufactured using 100% clean, renewable wind energy and produced in a Zero Manufacturing Waste to Landfill (ZMWL) facility.

The event in New York, for years considered a prime forum for movie stars, captains of industry and global leaders to put their good names to good works, is ending its run with a formidable list of accomplishments but burdened by the political complications of Hillary Clinton’s candidacy for president and the attendant scrutiny of the family’s ties to wealthy interests. Some well-known supporters of CGI, notably President Barack Obama, are missing from the guest list for this year’s meeting, when the door will close on an institution that’s won praise for reshaping philanthropy but also drawn derision for an atmosphere of pay-for-access. "If Breitbart and Fox are going on and on and on about how laced with controversy this organization is, that’s going to sound alarms to companies that are very risk averse," said Susan McPherson, a CGI member and CEO of McPherson Strategies, which advises corporate clients on philanthropic giving. "When you couple that with the presidential race, it makes it even riskier for them. They don’t want to be seen as pay-to-play if Hillary Clinton becomes president, and that has certainly had an effect this year." Some of the biggest corporate sponsors of years past are sitting out the finale: Exxon Mobil Corp. and Deutsche Bank AG already skipped last year, too. Other longtime sponsors Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Barclays PLC, and Blackstone Group LP are taking a pass as well. CGI will also be missing some of its main draws. Like Obama, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, will instead be at the United Nations General Assembly opening. Since Bill Clinton launched CGI as an arm of the Clinton Foundation in 2005, its members made more than 3,550 commitments and pledged to raise $125 billion to meet them, according to a Bloomberg News calculation based on annual reports. The group says its work has affected 430 million people in 180 countries. In philanthropy circles, CGI is widely credited with creating a new framework for giving and action, convening powerful figures from government, business and charities to address global problems. Members would pay for the privilege to meet and brainstorm solutions, then make financial commitments, often multi-year plans costing tens of millions of dollars. "When we started this in 2005 it was a great gamble," Clinton said Monday in opening remarks at the CGI meeting. "The way to end this is not on a nostalgia trip" but to "keep working to push the ball forward." Inaugural Meeting The annual event has been a showcase for Bill Clinton’s philanthropic aspirations in his post-presidency. At CGI’s inaugural meeting in September 2005, timed to coincide with the annual opening of UN session, Clinton showed his ambitions to keep his hand in world affairs beyond philanthropic commitments.  One panel featured a discussion about Mideast peace with King Abdullah II of Jordan, Condoleezza Rice, then secretary of state to President George W. Bush, and British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Rice praised CGI as a “wonderful initiative,” saying from the stage that “it mobilizes people to think what they can do about poverty and despair, and also hope and opportunity in the world.” The meeting resulted in 300 commitments worth more than $2.5 billion, the group said, and Clinton later said it had “succeeded beyond my expectations.” The following year’s lineup put on display the political and corporate star power Clinton could command, including Warren Buffett, Richard Branson, Bill Gates, Rupert Murdoch, first lady Laura Bush and French President Jacques Chirac. By 2009, CGI was ranked the No. 1 conference attracting CEOs from top companies, according to public relations firm Weber Shandwick “Five-Star Conference” study; in 2010, it took the No. 2 spot, behind the World Economic Forum in Davos. The bipartisan and non-political nature of the event persisted even after Hillary Clinton ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008 and then went on to serve as Obama’s first secretary of state. In September 2012, in the midst of the presidential race, then-Republican nominee Mitt Romney made an appearance. Clinton Impersonation Glamour was always a part of the CGI. In 2013, Bill Clinton was running late for a panel with the International Monetary Fund’s Christine LaGarde, Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg and Bono, when the U2 frontman grabbed the microphone and performed a spot-on impersonation of the former president, complete with accent and mannerisms. The CGI’s star power may have peaked in 2014, when 10 current or former heads of state were in attendance, including Obama. Although anticipation of her presidential run in 2016 was already building, Hillary Clinton emerged on the ballroom stage, bejeweled and swathed in royal blue, to announced, “Live from New York, it’s CGI!” Once her decision to run was set, the non-political air of CGI quickly faded. With rising populist anger at elites one of the defining features of the 2016 election season, Clinton’s relationship to wealthy donors, particularly those outside the U.S. who have contributed to the family foundation and attended the CGI meetings, became an unrelenting line of criticism of her both in the primary and general campaign.  Three days before the start of this year’s CGI, Donald Trump said he will press Hillary Clinton to release an audit of her family’s foundation work in Haiti, a country where both the foundation has done work and where CGI members have made millions of dollars worth of commitments. In a Slate podcast last month, one former CGI panel moderator, Adam Davidson, a contributor to the New Yorker and co-founder of NPR’s “Planet Money” program said that while he intends to support Hillary Clinton in November, CGI had given him a “creepy vibe” and that “it just feels like the worst version of an elite selling access to the aspirational” and creating a “theater” of doing good, while “it’s all about something else.” Zack Rosenburg, chief executive officer of SBP, a New Orleans-based disaster rebuilding and recovery firm that has looked to CGI for networking and sharing best pratices, called such criticism of CGI “a canard” and said, “there’s no doubt that the country and frankly the globe is better and healthier because of the commitments that have come out of the global initiative.” Most of the company’s taking a pass on this year’s gathering declined to comment beyond confirming they won’t participate.  Allen Jeffers, a spokesman for Exxon Mobil, said the company’s focus “has been on opportunities the CGI gave us to forge new partnerships with several nonprofit organizations working to combat malaria and provide economic opportunities for women in the developing world." Different Model From the outset, CGI had a different model for philanthropy. In fact, some of the commitments the group helped nail down weren’t philanthropy at all, like the one from private equity firm Leapfrog Investments. The firm launched a $135 million fund to invest in businesses serving lower income individuals in 10 developing nations to create 50,000 jobs. Two years later, it reported that revenue in its CGI portfolio increased 40.6 percent. Stephen Bowey, a partner at Leapfrog, said the group has created more than 102,000 jobs within four years. Venture capital firm Ignia made a commitment to CGI in 2011 to become the largest "impact investing fund" in Latin America. It raised and invested $200 million to meet that goal. That same year, Inerjys Ventures committed to setting up a $1 billion fund to invest in clean energy startups with the goal of turning them into profitable companies. The fund has since been scaled back to $300 million, according to a progress report. "We’re demonstrating the model we had initially talked about when we started engaging with CGI, bringing about real world examples of investing in tech companies and investing in projects to bring down the cost of clean energy," said Stephan Ouaknine, managing partner of Inerjys and a speaker at this year’s conference. Bob Harrison, president of CGI, said "if someone’s able to make money and also to do something positive from a social or environmental perspective it’s likely to be sustainable." Not all commitments have led to success. In 2005, Hollywood producer Stephen Bing, ex-World Bank President James Wolfensohn, venture capitalists Vinod Khosla and Ron Burkle made a $1 billion commitment to invest in renewable energy. The four made a few investments, but didn’t start a fund, according to Frank Quintero, a principal in Burkle’s Yucaipa Companies.  Others were difficult to assess. Greentech Automotive, the electric car company started by longtime Clinton confidante and Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, pledged in 2010 to sell Americans 100,000 electric cars at a price under $10,000. The company has yet to sell any cars in the U.S. In June, the Clinton Foundation released a study showing that 17 percent of its commitments were either unfulfilled or hadn’t provided progress reports for more than two years. There have been notable achievements. CGI helped broker a partnership between the AFL-CIO, the American Federation of Teachers and the National Building Trades Union to invest $14.5 billion in infrastructure investments since 2011, an effort they say has created at least 100,000 jobs. The group also put together the Energy and Resources Institute with more than 80 partner organizations to provide solar-powered electric lamps and charging stations to 900,000 people in Africa and Asia. Loyal Supporters Even though it’s lost some shine, plenty of longtime sponsors will still be at the final CGI meeting, including Procter & Gamble, which has made 14 CGI commitments since 2006, and furniture maker West Elm. West Elm President Jim Brett said that even though the criticism of CGI and the Clinton Foundation is unfounded, the negative coverage has cast enough of a shadow to give corporate public relations teams pause. “I’m very proud of our commitment, of our association with a foundation that does good in the world," Brett said. CGI’s end comes as the Clintons wind down philanthropic activities that could pose conflicts of interests if the former first lady, senator and secretary of state becomes president. Bill Clinton said he intends to continue a smaller, CGI university program that can be maintained with support from independent foundations and individuals. "In much of their work, they were aligned in their efforts with other funders, foundations, major nonprofits and NGOs," said Phil Buchanan, president of the Center for Effective Philanthropy, which evaluates charities. "I’m sure a lot of those funders are thinking, ’How can we step in?’" Bill Clinton had written in a 2007 book, “Giving,” that he wanted the annual meetings to continue for at least a decade to build a global network of citizen activists. In an August statement announcing this year’s would be the last, Clinton wrote, “That is exactly what CGI, its members and its dedicated staff have done.” In an interview with Charlie Rose for CBS and PBS released on Sept. 13, Bill Clinton said CGI had a bipartisan legacy and has been transparent. “I bent over backwards to try to make sure there was no conflict of interest, or appearance of conflict of interest,” the former president said. CGI “can’t run without the support of corporate sponsors and international contributors,” Clinton said. “That’s how we’ve gotten 3,500 commitments that have helped 430 million people in 180 countries. So, we can’t do that.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE Hillary Clinton Video Stories Philanthropy Family Terms of Service Trademarks Privacy Policy ©2016 Bloomberg L.P.

PHOTO BY: ENOS TECHE Facebook Twitter Google+ WhatsApp Email Exactly two years after the closure of Eveready’s Nakuru dry cell plant, the Kenyan market is suffering unstable supply of batteries, leading to shortage in most outlets across the country. This has been blamed on a six-month delay in the supply chain which has hurt the local market which now relies on imports. Most shops and retail stores in the country are currently short of the commodity, mostly used to power household equipment such as torches, remote controls, some radios and cameras among others. Common brands with shortages include Energizer products which Naivas chief commercial officer Willy Kimani yesterday said has had unstable supply for the last five months. Other common brands are Duracell and Eveready. Duracell has been in short of supply for the last four months, Kimani said. “The supply chain has been weak,” Kimani told the Star on phone affirming that the closure of Eveready East Africa's Nakuru plant in September 2014 “has a bit to play” in the shortage. A spot check by the Star over the last few weeks has established that major outlets such as Uchumi and Naivas have been experiencing a biting battery shortage. Uchumi’s Sarit Centre branch had no batteries at all, while the only battery brand available at some Naivas stores were a handful set of Varta and Energizer. All the household battery types D-size, dry cell AA and AAA have been affected. “The lack of D-size batteries has affected the ordering of some appliances such as torches that require this size of batteries. People aren’t quick to buy items that they can’t power. Eveready brought in supply about three months ago and it didn't last,” an attendant at Naivas, Westlands branch told the Star. Eveready closed down after grappling with unrelenting competition from cheap imports and counterfeits, that left the plant operating at about 25 per cent of its capacity. It resorted to importing batteries from its affiliate Energizer Egypt to sell locally. Eveready diversified into car batteries, shavers and light bulbs. The shortage of Duracell batteries has been attributed to the February 29, sell of the brand by Procter & Gamble to American multinational -Berkshire Hathaway. “Since P&G sold Duracell the products have not been in the market. We have however been assured that the products will be back in one or two weeks time,” Kimani said. Thank you for participating in discussions on The Star, Kenya.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File) Obama set for national security interview on CNN By Susan Crabtree (@susancrabtree) • 9/19/16 5:51 PM Susan Crabtree White House Correspondent The Washington Examiner http://s3.amazonaws.com/content.washingtonexaminer.biz/images/static/authors/Crabtree-3.jpg Share Tweet Mail Print SMS More President Obama will participate in a CNN town hall-style interview on the military, veterans and national security issues Sept. 28, two days after Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump face off in their first debate. CNN anchor and chief Washington correspondent Jake Tapper will sit down with the president for a meeting titled, "America's military and the commander in chief," which will air live at 9 p.m. The president's national security legacy is a divisive topic, and opinions about its success or failure largely breaks down along partisan lines. Obama fulfilled his promise of ending the war in Iraq and bringing all troops home, and has reduced the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan. But the rise of the Islamic State and its ability to recruit and carry out attacks in western countries has thwarted his attempt to shift attention away from the Middle East.

His decision not to enforce his own red line in Syria and ongoing violence there, along with the Islamic State's use of the war-torn country as a safe haven, will also impact his foreign policy legacy. Obama has also overseen what might have been the biggest scandal to hit the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the failure of that agency to keep up with the health demands of veterans has marred his record. Obama in 2014 was forced to oust VA Secretary Eric Shinseki amid a ballooning scandal that the agency was cooking its books to cover-up long appointment wait-times. Obama appointed former Procter & Gamble CEO Robert McDonald to replace him. Despite some improvements in wait times, stories about lax VA service and oversight have continued to plague the agency.
