The 2016 Summer Olympics are officially over. The games provided some unforgettable performances and iconic moments that will live in the pantheon of sporting highlights forever. Michael Phelps ended his illustrious career with 28 Olympic medals, including 23 golds. Usain Bolt completed a triple-triple, by winning gold medals in three events in the past three summer Olympics. Simone Biles became what many are considering the “greatest gymnast of all time,” by winning five medals, four golds. These athletes and many like them were broadcast to an average of 27.9 million Americans each night, according to Nielsen ratings. It is time for marketers to take their positions in a race to nab the best faces for their best brands. Companies must consider popularity, looks, athleticism, personality and overall likeability when it comes to choosing the right athlete to market their products. DMN has taken these all into consideration and selected the ten best choices for companies. Marketers, on your mark, get set, go! Simone Biles USA 4 Gold, 1 Bronze When Mary Lou Retton called the four-foot, nine-inch Simone Biles the “greatest gymnast of all time,” it was an certified affirmation of what all who watched her knew. The 19-year old gymnast, whose face has become one of the more recognizable since the games began, currently has an endorsement deal with P&G. Sample Tagline: Success comes in all sizes Neymar Brazil Soccer Gold Who else but the savior of Brazilian soccer? The men's soccer Olympic gold medal game, between the home nation of Brazil and Germany, ended in a 1-1 tie, forcing the decision to be decided by a penalty shootout. After four successful takes each Germany's Nils Petersen missed, allowing Neymar to score the winning goal. A company couldn't ask for a better moment to market! The Barcelona FC player has endorsement deals with Nike, Red Bull, Panasonic, Konami and Gillette. Sample Tagline: Worth the wait Ashton Eaton USA Decathlon Gold The Greatest Athlete in the World. The nickname is bestowed upon those who win gold in the decathlon. And in Ashton Eaton's case, he's the greatest athlete for the second straight summer Olympics. The 28-year old has endorsement deals with P&G, Gillette and Visa. Sample Tagline: The master of all trades Claressa Shields USA 75-kilogram Gold The 21 year old boxer has “money in the making” written all over her brand. At the 2016 Summer Olympics, Shields made history by capturing a second gold medal by defeating the Netherland's Nouchka Fontijin in the women's middleweight (75-kilogram) division in a unanimous decision. Currently, Shields lacks any major endorsements deals. However, with the right company and right product, Shield can become a household name. Sample Tagline: Twice as nice Helen Maroulis USA 53-kilogram Gold The 24-year old American freestyle wrestler was a dark horse in the 2016 Summer Olympics 53-kilogram tournament and a dark horse for our marketing list. However, just like in the finals against wrestling legend Saori Yoshida, we expect Maroulis to be a major success in the marketing world. Sample Tagline: Driven by doubt Abbey D'Agostino & Nikki Hamblin USA and New Zealand 5000M No medals The U.S. and New Zealand started the 2016 Summer Olympics as competitors in the 5000m race. After the two collided and fell with 2,000m to go in the race, they became each other's motivators and the world's inspirators. The two runners have been honored with the Fair Play awards in the Olympic park in Rio. Sample Tagline: Never too competitive to be compassionate Pita Taufatofua Tonga Taekwondo No medal The Tongan flagbearer may have entered into the Olympics conversation because of his striking looks, but his excellent demeanor and good humor at being turned into a meme - not to mention his tolerance of some handsy NBC broadcasters -- could turn him into a great pitchman.   Tagline: Always be ready for the spotlight Katie Ledecky USA Swimming Four golds, one silver, two World Records Her  dominance dominated the International competition. She won X medals, but none were more impressive than her victory in the 800 meters. She bested the runner up  by 11.38 seconds,  driving sports publications to compare that victory to other great moments in sports. Tafline: What will you do with your 11 seconds? Mónica Puig Puerto Rico Women's Tennis Gold Medal Not only did Puig (mid-30s WTA ranking before the tournament began), upset the #2 player in the world for gold, it was Puerto Rico's only medal in the Rio games and Puerto Rico's first-ever gold medal.

Back to BERNAMA.com  | 24 November 2016 SMA Kajang Tops Pahlawan Planet Challenge By Farina Ashrin Ariffin KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 22 (Bernama) -- SMA Persekutuan Kajang has emerged as the top school in the first month recycling challenge for Pahlawan Planet, a green campaign by Treat Every Environment Special (TrEES) and Procter & Gamble Malaysia (P&G). Based on the highest average tonnage collected per student, SMA Persekutuan Kajang topped 34 other schools from across Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Putrajaya and Negeri Sembilan with a total of 3,600 kg of recyclables, said the organisers in a statement. The 35 schools implemented their submitted proposals on innovative home-to-school recycling and advocacy campaigns, and collected a combined weight of 40,000 kg of recyclables in the first month. "The Pahlawan Planet campaign has brought together our teachers, students and families to take a personal and shared responsibility for the environment in school and at home," said SMAPK Principal, Mohd Abd Aziz Bin Mahmud. "This has been an outstanding opportunity for our students to understand how their individual and collective behaviour affects the environment and I encourage other schools to organise or participate in similar programmes in the future," he added in a statement. COMMITTED IN SUSTAINABILITY "We are committed to making sure sustainability is part of all we do. We want our brands to help consumers make more sustainable choices," said Communications & Government Relations Leader, P&G Malaysia, Singapore & Brunei, Nadiah Syed Nahar. "Students participating in the Pahlawan Planet campaign are learning the importance of not just caring for the environment but skills beyond the classroom. I look forward to seeing the positive impact of the overall campaign," she added. For their top contribution, SMAPK received 500 sets of exclusive recycling starter kits to further help students recycle and separate solid waste at home more effectively. Supported by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Urban Wellbeing, Housing and Local Government, Pahlawan Planet campaign is designed by TrEES and P&G, for secondary school students to educate, cultivate and reinforce a culture of caring for the environment by embracing the 4Rs (Rethink, Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) at home and in school. --BERNAMA Tweet   Tweets by @lifestyle_youth © 2016 BERNAMA.

Gerald Winters, 44, is preparing to open Gerald Winters & Son on Main Street in the storefront that was formerly home to Bottles & Cans in downtown Bangor’s Standard Shoe Building. He hopes to open as soon as possible next month. “I’ve been selling privately for probably 18 years, but never publicly, never like this,” Winters said during a recent interview inside his shop. Winters — a former computer programmer who has worked for Procter and Gamble, the stock exchange, and the U.S. government — bought his first rare book at a Sotheby’s auction in New York City in 1998. He was hooked. Now, buying and selling rare books, manuscripts and letters is his career. Story continues below advertisement. He was raised in Australia, went to school in New York City, and has lived in Japan, Ireland and Thailand, among other places. In each place he’s lived, he’s acquired books. His collection, which he estimates exceed 5,000 books and other materials, has been in storage in locations across the globe, and he’s working to get the collection to Bangor. Winters will be displaying rare books, letters, proofs and manuscripts from a range of authors — Stephen King, J.R.R. Tolkien, George R.R. Martin, J.D. Salinger, James Joyce and others. He’ll also have affordable items, such as used paperbacks, movies and other memorabilia for sale. He’s also planning to start a weekend Tolkien reading group to get children interested in the “Lord of the Rings” author’s work. He ran a similar program for underprivileged children while he was a graduate student in New York City, he said. “At least if they’re here, people can come in and see them,” Winters said. The storefront also will serve as a base of operations and out-of-home office for his selling and buying of items, Winters said. Winters, his wife, and their 2-year-old son recently left Bangkok, where his wife’s family runs a business that sells pharmaceuticals and seafood, and set down roots in Bangor. Winters said the family decided to move back to the states because they didn’t want to raise their son in Thailand, and settled on Bangor after seeing it mentioned on a “top places to raise your family” listing. Winters, who has no Maine ties, recognized it as the home of one of his favorite authors — horror novelist Stephen King. That clinched it. The Winters started settling in Bangor in April. Winters had visited Bangor about a dozen times over the years to buy or sell rare King items from Bangor residents and the former Betts Bookstore, formerly owned by Stu Tinker who today runs King-themed tours around town. Winters struggled with reading as a young man, but when he was 26, he picked up a copy of “The Stand,” a post-apocalyptic fantasy novel published in 1978. “I devoured it,” Winters said. “I read it in a week.” He started reading more, collecting more. “He’s been a big influence in my life,” Winters said of King. “Probably of my favorite living writers, he’s the biggest in the world.” Follow Nick McCrea on Twitter at @nmccrea213.   Recommend this article SEE COMMENTS → Previous story:« This Maine family is baking its way to college savings with granola Next story:If you have to borrow, here’s how to do it smartly » News Blogs Living Sports Opinion Bath-built destroyer breaks down, towed out of Panama Canal Bangor police explain why woman not charged in possible hate crime assault St. Clair: $40M in private funds ‘go away’ if monument abolished Texas man summoned in Smyrna hit and run crash State police search for suspect in Smyrna hit-and-run ‘Hamilton’ and the implosion of the American left Where are the voices of indigenous people in the Thanksgiving story?

Focus should be on advancing this group of workers’ skills to improve service delivery. PHOTO | FILE  By Queen Munguti Posted  Sunday, August 21   2016 at  17:38 In Summary Marketing strategy could see firm broaden consumer database for its products. Global product manufacturer, Procter and Gamble (P&G), has announced a partnership with the Midwives Association of Kenya (MAK) to address gaps in maternal healthcare services, a marketing strategy that could see the company broaden its consumer database for its products. SHARE THIS STORY Tweet “Midwives are often ignored in the majority of health systems, yet they play a critical role in the provision of quality and safe maternal healthcare,” said Anthony Nganga, P&G’s Commercial Director. “Partnering with Midwives Association of Kenya will place more emphasis on the childbearing cycle. We will focus on advancing their skills so as to improve service delivery to expectant mothers,” he said. The initiative comes as part of a long-term global programme: “We are proud to announce that P&G’s mother and baby healthcare programme has reached approximately 10 million mothers since its inception,” said Nganga. In line with this programme globally, P&G will now open a direct marketing channel to deliver product information and free product samples to new mothers, by partnering with MAK. “The partnership is a part of the P&G’s mother and baby healthcare programme, an educative programme where we visit different healthcare facilities around the country and talk to mothers who have just delivered and at the same time give free samples of our diaper brand, Pampers,” said George Owour the Government Relations Manager for P&G. “As we conduct the educative programme, we also collect the mothers’ contact information so that we can do follow ups .” Throughout this kind of database marketing, brands can create a long lasting relationship with consumers, which fosters brand loyalty. “Such a marketing strategy creates brand visibility and once a consumer has a free sample of product there is a high chance they will continue using the same product afterwards, leading to brand loyalty,” said Jael Amara, the director of Consumer Options. “And again, interacting with the consumers is an indication that the brand cares, thus creates a brand-consumer relationship that may be long term.” For P&G, the strategy could see increased sales in their products while at the same time provide a competitive advantage in the market place. According to an article on the impact of database marketing by Valient Market Research, a corporate strategy, market research and advisory firm, the effective use of database marketing can help a brand generate personal communication to its customers and differentiate its brand among competitors. “It presents distinct advantages for certain brands that are willing to use its data to improve its marketing efforts.” Another example of this is Road Runner Sports, a store that specialises in selling athletics gear in the US In 2006, it partnered with Experian Marketing Services, an information service company, in order to create and develop a database marketing solution to communicate with, integrate and understand their customers better, according to an article on the partnership by PRNewswire. “The key to growing our business is to create a compelling shopping experience with every customer interaction,” said Peter Taylor, general manager for Road Runner Sports. “To do this with the highest degree of effectiveness, we quickly realised that we needed a database marketing solution that would integrate our customer data across our entire enterprise to provide the foundation of analysing customer information.” 1 | 2 Next Page » Latest from Daily Nation: Business LeapFrog buys Goodlife Pharmacy for Sh2bn Family Bank staff cut costs push lender to issue profit warning State bets on new pest-proof storage bags to reduce maize wastage Fraudsters give Kenyans importing vehicles from Japan sleepless nights Airtel loses 16-year battle against KRA’s Sh531m claim NSE top gainers & losers n-soko About us Contact us Digital Editions Syndication Help Privacy Policy Terms RSS

One of the youngest U.S. Olympians this year in Rio, Hernandez has also been one of the most high-profile, winning the gold with the team in the all-around competition, and scoring an individual silver medal for the balance beam. Exuberant and talkative, Hernandez’s big smile and cheerful demeanor have earned her legions of tween fans – and given her the nickname “the human emoji.” She has even earned a partnership deal with Crest toothpaste – which makes complete sense once you see her smile. With the competition behind her, a carefree Hernandez sat down with PEOPLE at the P&> Family Home in Rio to talk about the games, her fans, and her future. GettyYou’ve had an amazing time here at the Olympics. What has been the best part of being part of the Final Five? It was great to really experience it with these other girls. We were all from different backgrounds, but we came together for a reason. I loved that about it. You have spoken before about your heritage, and how important it was for you to represent Hispanics. What did you mean by that? We’re a very diverse group this year with gymnastics, and I think that’s amazing. I think that it’s such a great thing for me to represent Hispanics. When I was a little kid, I don’t remember looking up and seeing so many Hispanic athletes out there. But look at this Olympics. There was Monica Puig, who I think is just awesome!” So what’s the message of the Final Five? The message is don’t stop at anything. Don’t let people tell you that you can’t do something. It doesn’t matter whether you’re black, white, Hispanic. If you want something, just go out and do it. I hope that little girls – black, white, Hispanic, whatever – can look at our team and find someone to inspire them. Do you think of yourself fas a role model? I don’t know. Gosh, I want to be a role model. I want to be able to know that I inspired girls to work hard and go for their dreams, and to never give up. I hope that is the message that people get when they see me. I hope the Final Five has shown that everyone is capable of success if they work hard. I wasn’t just representing Hispanics; I was representing Team U.S.A. I hope people understand that. What’s something that would surprise people gymnastics? I think people don’t know how much work goes into it sometimes. I wish people could watch the hard days that we all go through. I wish they could see the days when it’s just really rough, and that we have to push through it, and still come out with a smile. Then they’d understand. Getty You’re going on a nationwide tour where you’ll get to see a lot of fans up close. Looking forward to it? Absolutely! It’s a 36-city tour. I’m just so excited. We’ll go out there and enjoy ourselves while we’re out there. You’ll really see this happiness radiate through all of us! So how do you handle school while training and touring? I’ve actually been homeschooled since the third grade. I’ve learned how to fit my schooling in – weekends, evenings. I’m good with the time management. I’m keeping up with my studies. You’ve got a huge fanbase of tweens. Is that funny to you? I think it’s hilarious and great! I think it’s because I’m almost in the same age level as them, and I’m doing something that they dreamed of doing. As a little kid, I watched the gymnasts and said, “Wow, mom. I want to go to the Olympics.” So the fact that I’m actually here is mind-blowing to me.

Peltz Los Angeles Times Twitter Facebook Email Reddit When the Summer Olympics end Sunday, the clock starts ticking for medal winners hoping to cash in on their glory. Other than established multimillionaire stars such as U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps and Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, the Olympians have a brief window of opportunity – most likely a few weeks – to sign potentially lucrative endorsement deals once the Games are over. A handful might profit handsomely, notably gymnast Simone Biles, who arrived in Rio de Janeiro with endorsements already in hand and then captured the nation’s attention by winning four gold medals and one bronze. But most medalists won’t get rich from their efforts because corporations looking for celebrity endorsers know that the athletes – and their Olympic sports held only once every four years – don’t maintain the attention paid to traditional sports such as football and baseball, experts said. “Very few of them” will attain significant wealth from the Rio Games, said Ben Sturner, chief executive of Leverage Agency, a sports and entertainment marketing firm. “The news media will not be covering you three or four weeks from now.” That’s especially true with the Summer Olympics, said Matt Delzell, managing director at the Marketing Arm, a sports marketing agency. “The shelf life is so short for Summer Olympians because the timing is so bad,” he said. “We’re two weeks away from college football and the NFL, and the Major League Baseball playoffs are soon, so it’s a terrible time for the Olympic athletes to make hay in the spotlight. ”Most marketers know that Katie Ledecky’s name, come January, sadly is going to be a whole lot lesser known than it is now,“ even though the swimmer captured four gold medals in Brazil, Delzell said. It’s a moot point at the moment for Ledecky, who has opted to attend college and maintain her amateur status. But Biles – a three-time world champion – and others chose to turn professional, with Biles dropping plans to attend UCLA. Biles, 19, had inked endorsement deals before the Olympics began, including a television commercial for Procter & Gamble Co.’s Tide detergent that ran during the games, and her net worth already tops $2 million, according to MoneyNation.com. Biles and four other athletes also have been on the front and back covers of various Kellogg Co. cereal boxes since mid-June, extending the decades-old tradition of Olympic athletes being featured on cereal boxes. But for most Olympians, ”it’s just tough“ to land sponsorship deals, not only because they’re no longer on television but also because they’re less likely to maintain the buzz on social media that advertisers now crave, said Matt Balvanz, vice president for analytics at Navigate Research. ”What are the social-media conversations about these athletes and how soon do they fall off? Two weeks out, no one will be talking about them,“ Balvanz said. None of the medal winners in Rio returns home empty handed, however. The United States Olympic Committee pays bonuses – $25,000 for each gold medal, $15,000 for silver and $10,000 for bronze – that can be accepted by amateur students such as Ledecky under NCAA rules. Certain sports federations also pay bonuses to American medal winners. The USA Wrestling Foundation, for instance, is handing out a sizable $250,000 for gold medalists in Rio, along with $50,000 for silver and $25,000 for bronze. The Olympic gold medals themselves, which are 85 millimeters in diameter and weigh 500 grams, are valued at about $564 apiece, based on the recent price of gold, according to Forbes. That’s well below the record price of $708 for the 2012 Olympics in London, when gold and silver prices were higher. Each gold medal, produced by the Mint of Brazil, actually is mostly made of silver and plated with six grams of gold. If the entire medal was made of gold, it would be valued at nearly $22,000. That’s still small change compared with a multimillion-dollar shoe or apparel contract that a select few, such as Phelps, have been able to command. But this year, ”is anybody going to make seven-figure endorsements from these Olympics? I doubt it,“ Delzell said. Phelps reportedly has a net worth of $55 million, and Bolt’s reportedly tops $60 million, in good part because they’ve had long, superlative careers spanning more than one Olympics. That’s kept them relevant with consumers, analysts said. Yet even if other athletes don’t hit the endorsement jackpot immediately after these Olympics, they can still build a career from their momentary brilliance at the Games, said Rob Prazmark, chief executive of 21 Sports & Entertainment Market Group. Some Olympic athletes find ways to stay in the public’s eye – and thus relevant for endorsements from corporations – by appearing on TV shows, making public appearances or joining the broadcasting field. ”Dancing with the Stars,“ for instance, has become a destination for former Olympians such as soccer player Hope Solo, figure skater Kristi Yamaguchi and speed skater Apolo Anton Ohno. ”Don’t measure it by how much money they make this year,“ Prazmark said. “Their value as an Olympian doesn’t end after they win gold, it’s how they work their Olympic achievements. You don’t have to be Michael Phelps to make a career out of being an Olympian.” Published: Aug. 21, 2016, midnight  Tags: business, olympics Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Unlimited Digital Access Print edition home delivery Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

Red Cross Aug 22, 2016, 16:53 ET Share this article WASHINGTON, Aug. 22, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The American Red Cross remains on the ground, with volunteers across nearly half of the state of Louisiana helping the thousands of people who have lost everything they own in the devastating flooding last week. But the relief organization reports a significant gap in funds raised. To date, the Red Cross has received approximately $7.8 million in donations and pledges designated to support Louisiana – not nearly enough to cover the estimate of at least $30 million in costs.

Technavio defines an emerging trend as a factor that has the potential to significantly impact the market and contribute to its growth or decline. In 2015, 34% of total sales were made through specialty retailers, making it the largest retail channel by the value of sales for personal appliances at the global level. "It is important to note that the fastest growing retail channel for personal care appliances is the online retail format. The recent launch of Gillette Shave Club in mid-2015 is enabling Gillette to regain online share and compete with rivals such as Dollar Shave Club. More players are seen entering the online space through independent online clubs, apart from selling their products through third-party pure-play online retailers like Amazon," says Poonam Saini, a lead analyst at Technavio for research on retail goods and services The top three emerging trends driving the global personal care appliances market according to Technavio consumer and retail research analysts are: Frequent travelers fuel demand for travel-size appliances Trend of smart personal appliances Focus on specific target customers to increase presence Frequent travelers fuel demand for travel-size appliances With the increased frequency of traveling nowadays, the demand for travel-size appliances is on the rise. Individuals generally prefer using their own personal appliances during traveling, be it a trimmer, epilator, or a hair care appliance such as a dryer or a styler. Carrying a small electric tool such as a trimmer or an epilator is beneficial on-the-go. Heating elements like hair dryers and curling irons are also commonly carried by consumers while traveling. To address this need for travel-size appliances, vendors are increasingly focusing on launching different travel kits. Braun launched its Braun M90 shaver, named aptly as the mobile shaver as it looks like a mobile handset. Philips Norelco PQ208/40 is another efficient travel shaver. The electric razor weighs 5.6 ounces and is just one inch in length, and operates via two AA batteries. This light weight makes it an easy appliance to carry while on the go. Panasonic Men's Razor for Travel ES-RS10-S is another shaver built exclusively for travelers. Trend of smart personal appliances Vendors are capitalizing on the trend of consumers switching to technologically advanced products. For instance, the French company Kolibree launched a smart power toothbrush that can connect to smartphones via Bluetooth. The toothbrush has 3D motion sensors and was designed with the help of qualified dental professionals. Its handle comes equipped with an accelerometer, magnetometer, and a gyro meter to keep the user informed about the position and orientation of the brush. This ensures that the brush reaches all sections of the mouth to thoroughly clean it. "The toothbrush also uses game mechanics to motivate people, especially children, to brush for the right duration. Also, the manufacturer has provided an open application program interface for the creation of more mobile apps, which can be synced to the brush for a better brushing experience," adds Poonam. P&G's Oral-B also launched a power toothbrush with Bluetooth 4.0 capabilities. The brush provides its users with the real-time information on brushing patterns. The introduction of smart toothbrushes shows how the Internet of Things (IoT) trend is impacting manufacturers to come up with smart appliances. Focus on specific target customers to increase presence Vendors are now launching products keeping in mind the specific target audience a strategy that will help them enhance their presence in both developed and developing markets. For instance, in India, where over 40% of the population is young, hair care products and grooming kits have registered an increase in demand in recent times. In 2015, Philips India launched two new products in its male grooming and beauty range segments keeping in mind the Indian target audience. Designed especially for the youth in the emerging markets that lie outside the metro areas, Philips Pro Skin Trimmer-BT1000 and Philips Selfie Straightener HP8302 offer consumers the freedom to style at their convenience. These gadgets are designed to give the youth the best styling technology at an affordable price. Philips Pro Skin Trimmer-BT1000 and Philips Selfie Straightener HP8302 are designed specially to meet the evolving needs of casual and DIY styling for young men and women across all emerging towns and cities.

Speedo tweeted the following statement on Monday: Speedo USA today announces the decision to end its sponsorship of Ryan Lochte. As part of this decision, Speedo USA will donate a $50,000 portion of Lochte’s fee to Save the Children, a global charity partner of Speedo USA’s parent company, for children in Brazil. While we have enjoyed a winning relationship with Ryan for over a decade and he has been an important member of the Speedo team, we cannot condone behavior that is counter to the values this brand has long stood for. We appreciate his many achievements and hope he moves forward and learns from this experience. The 32-year-old sparked an international controversy over a robbery that turned out to be a made-up story. Lochte issued a statement on Friday where he apologized for his “behavior,” citing language barriers and being out late in a foreign country as contributing factors to the international incident. Even without the scandal, Lochte went to Rio with fewer sponsors than he had in London, when he was endorsed by companies like Gatorade, Nissan, Mutual of Omaha and P&G. Ralph Lauren also announced Monday it would not renew its sponsorship contract with the 12-time Olympic medalist. Even without the incident, Lochte’s endorsement deals may have been hurt by the fact that his teammate Michael Phelps stole some of his thunder when he came out of retirement to go to Rio and hinted that this could be his last Olympics. For Lochte, picking up endorsements isn’t just about prestige — sponsor funding will be key if he wants to compete at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. His teammate Phelps was in a similar spot when a photo of him smoking a bong surfaced and he was then charged with DUI. He initially lost sponsors, but he won new ones after going to rehab and appearing sorry for his actions.

As the scandal centered on swimmer Ryan Lochte’s false claims of being robbed at gunpoint in Rio illustrates,  matching Olympic champions with Fortune 500 brands can be a crap shoot putting companies in an uncomfortable spot when the relationship comes apart. Both Ralph Lauren (RL) and Speedo, the swimwear company,  announced that they were ending their sponsorship agreements with Lochte.  Airweave mattresses founder and CEO Motokuni Takaoka, who previously told Bloomberg News, that Lochte “will remain the U.S. ambassador for Airweave as long as our partnership agreement remains effective” had a change of heart.  “After careful consideration, we have made the decision to end our partnership with Ryan Lochte,” a spokeswoman for the Japanese company said in an email.  Even though Lochte has since publicly apologized for what he called his “intoxicated”  and “immature” behavior,   corporate America probably won’t be interested in doing business with him in the future, according to sports marketing experts.  The Olympian also faces possible sanctions from U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Swimming. Play Video CBS Evening News Ryan Lochte issues apology for Rio robbery story Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte apologized for a gas station incident in Rio that earned him embarrassing headlines in tabloids across America. Ben T... “Lochte has damaged his brand irreparably, created an international incident and proven how stupid he is,” said sports marketing expert Bob Dorfman, executive creative director at Baker Street Advertising. “No sponsor wants to attach their name to an athlete like that. What’s more, at 32 his Olympic career was already over after Rio. Would’ve been hard for him to stay top of mind, even if hadn’t instigated LochteGate.” For the current crop of elite Olympic athletes seeking to cash in on their athletic success, the most challenging race begins after the hoopla from the Rio games dies down. According to sports marketing expert Joe Favorito, about 100 to 150 Olympians are associated with brands, a huge increase from the 15 to 20 with endorsements in the recent past.   “Brands are focused on what the return is compared with what they’re spending,” said Favorito, who also teaches at Columbia University. “Are there going to be opportunities in the millions for some? Maybe. I would say more it’s in the hundreds of thousands or thousands.” Indeed,  Michael Phelps reportedly earned $12 million in endorsement income last year, thanks to deals with Under Armour (UA),  Procter & Gamble (PG),  Hilton (HLT​) and Louis Vuitton among others. The 31-year-old, who has won more Olympic medals than anyone in history, is known to 64 percent of the public, according to Q Scores, which measures how celebrities resonate with the public. Play Video CBSN Michael Phelps' game face becomes viral meme Does Michael Phelps' game face look more like a death stare? CBSN's Vladimir Duthiers has more. In addition, he has a positive Q Score of 19, indicating the percentage of the general public considering him to be one of their favorite athletes. His money-making potential seems boundless when public appearance fees are considered. “I would think his deal with Under Armour might be similar to what Nike (NKE​) has with Michael Jordan,” Dorfman said. “Does Under Armour come out with a line of Michael Phelps swimwear?’ What about seemingly superhuman sprinter Usain Bolt? According to Q Score, fewer Americans had heard of the Jamaican before the Olympics, finding that just 38 percent knew of Bolt, but 20 percent considered him to be among their favorite athletes. Forbes Magazine estimates that Bolt, who has captured gold medals in the last three Olympics in both the 100 and 200 meters, earns $32.5 million in winnings and endorsements. And he’s certainly is well known internationally, which makes him attractive to sponsors. “He seems to have staying power, personality,” Dorfman said. U.S. multigold-medal gymnast Simone Biles appears to be another Olympic star who’s a good match for Corporate America. Biles, who captured four gold medals in Rio and carried the American flag during the closing ceremony, wasn’t well known to the public before the games. According to Q Scores, she had a 21 level of public awareness, but her Q Score of 30 indicates that the people who know her like her. 47 Photos U.S. women gymnasts go for gold Simone Biles came out on top and and Aly Raisman claimed silver in the individual all-around competition after the U.S. "Final Five" dominated to... Adding to the 19-year-old’s appeal, she has also overcome obstacles in her personal life. He mother was unable to care for Biles and her siblings, who were subsequently taken in by her grandparents, who later adopted them.    Biles also is young enough that she’ll likely compete in another Olympics, which makes her an even more attractive partner for companies looking to hitch on to a star. U.S. swimmer Katie Ledecky also won four gold medals, is also 19 and likely hasn’t swum in her last Olympic competition. Phelps, however, said he has taken his final Olympic lap in Rio, and Bolt also has indicated that he’s done chasing Olympic glory. Each of these athletes is racing against the public’s ever-shortening attention span. “Obviously the challenge for Olympic athletes is that nobody cares about these events for four years,” said Dorfman, “and we move onto the next big thing.” © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc..

By Roger Baird , Dan Cancian , Video by Jonathan Lowe August 22, 2016 07:46 BST Close Embed Feed Going for gold: Which Team GB athletes could get the best brand deals? IBTimes UK <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/20118" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> As Great Britain's talented Olympic athletes are celebrating their best medal haul in more than a century at Rio 2016, executives from the world's biggest companies are scrambling to land their signatures to endorse their brands. British athletes are not paid to bring home Olympic medals, but a number of UK stars at the Rio games will become multi-millionaires. A few will see a see several inspired minutes, backed by a lifetime of hard work, turn them into household names. Great Britain's Olympic team finished the games with 67 medals in total, including 27 gold, beating China to come second in the tally behind the USA. The result was the team's best medal haul since the first time London held the games in 1908. Liz Nicholl, the chief executive of UK Sport which funds Olympic athletes from lottery cash, said that the UK had now become a "sporting superpower". Favourites are being lined up for post-Olympic stardom such as Laura Trott and Jason Kenny who got engaged while watching EastEnders on their sofa, and who now have amassed ten gold medals between them. Two-time Olympic champion gymnast Max Whitlock, also captured the public imagination as a 10.4 million TV audience watched him pick up his second gong on the pommel horse in the middle of the night, after becoming men's floor champion earlier. Sports sponsorship agents say the country's first gold of the games won in the pool by Adam Peaty who set a world record in his heat for the 100m breaststroke, and another in the final, could become a surprise hit of the games. Ad executives say he has a compelling back-story, because he was afraid of the water as a child. Cycling gold medalists Laura Trott and Jason Kenny during the medal ceremony after the men's Keirin race.Bryn Lennon/ Getty Images Others say Charlotte Dujardin could also become a left-field hit. The country's most successful British dressage rider added a gold and a silver to the pair of golds she won in London 2012, and front-page newspaper pictures of her and her horse Valegro held the imagination. The rewards are tempting for an athlete who captures the public mood. A top athletic star earns up to £700,000 a year for TV commercials for a major corporation, says chief executive of sports marketing agency CSM Zak Brown. A sports star will be able to hold three or four of these deal across various markets. A top star will also be able to charge up to £40,000 for speaking engagement and will able to fit in 50 to 100 of these a year. "Audiences love to hear their triumphs over tough times, they find it inspiring," said Brown. A TV audience of 10.4m saw Max Whitlock pick up his second gymnastic gold in the middle of the nightGetty Images Great success is not enough, the feel good factor is extremely important for an athlete, as is personality. - Victoria Cook, business planning partner at media agency Mindshare These are the kind of incomes heptathlete Jessica Ennis-Hill and long-distance runner Mo Farah have earned since they won golds and became the face of the London games in 2012. Farah added two more golds to his tally to make him a four-time Olympic champion. Ennis-Hill, who has a flawless public image, has deals with Omega, BP, Santander, Adidas and Vitality. The multi-event athlete, who became a mother two years ago, recently signed a deal to promote nappy brand Pampers made by US household goods giant P&G. Ad executives say Ennis-Hill is still highly marketable, and her image is likely to mature, rather than fade, over time. Steve Madincea, founder and chief executive sports marketing firm, Prism says: "We can also expect Ennis-Hill's media presence to move from the likes of GQ to parenting titles." But it takes a curious combination of character traits to win the public over. Sportspeople are by their nature, competitive and determined. However, in public they have to appear easy-going and affable. Three athletes in Rio all took a knock to their public images when their naturally competitive streaks came under scrutiny. Cyclist Mark Cavendish attracted criticism for crash he caused during an omnium race, gymnast Louis Smith was labelled a poor loser to GB rival Max Whitlock, and heptathlete Katrina Johnson Thompson was accused of being defensive in an interview after finishing fifth in the multi-event competition she had been tipped to push Ennis-Hill hard in. Victoria Cook, business planning partner in media agency Mindshare says: "Great success is not enough, the feel good factor is extremely important for an athlete, as is personality." Laura Trott and Jason Kenny will come under a lot of pressure to play the David and Victoria Beckham of British cycling. But as Anthony Scammell, a sports director at public relations firm Hill & Knowlton, says: "The only problem is they don't want to take up that role. They are both very down to earth, and Jason in particular likes to keep a very low profile away from the track." And even when an athlete has the X factor that makes them a favourite with the public, they may prefer to devote all their time to trying to win more medals. Cyclist Bradley Wiggins achieved iconic status at the London games four years ago by winning the time trial gold, just weeks after becoming the first Briton in history to triumph at the Tour de France. The charismatic cyclist won gold again in Rio as part of the men's team pursuit, bringing his total of Olympic golds to five. The sponsors of the 2012 BBC Sports Personality of the Year include Samsung and Hyundai, but Wiggins could upgrade those to more heavyweight endorsements if he wished. Hill & Knowlton's Scammell says: "He has the combination of all the things the public likes in a male sports star. He is laidback and likes a joke, but he does not seem that interested in commercial deals. He is more focused on the goals in the sport he has set for himself." However, the race is on to find Great Britain's face of the Rio Olympics.

Skip to content News Watch PEN Photos Style Royals Food Premium Shop Sports Gabby Douglas: Despite Backlash, I Had a 'Fantastic' Time in Rio By Steve Helling•@stevehelling Posted on August 21, 2016 at 7:40pm EST Share Tweet Email With the exception of certain members of the U.S. Swimming team, no gold medalist in the 2016 games got quite as much backlash as Gabby Douglas. First she wasn’t clapping hard enough for her teammates. Then she wasn’t bubbly enough. Then she didn’t put her hand over her heart during the medal ceremony. The backlash was nonstop. Few people seemed to remember that, despite her veteran Olympic status, Douglas is just 20 years old and living in a world where every smile – or lack thereof – can spark intense social media hate. So after all the social media backlash, it would be unsurprising if Douglas were bitter or unhappy about her experience. But Douglas insists that she still had a “fantastic” time in Rio. “I had fun,” she tells PEOPLE. “Maybe people weren’t being fair on social media, but that’s social media for you.” “I just found things to be positive about,” she says. “And there’s a lot to be happy about. We won the gold medal as a team, and it was just such an amazing experience. I came to the Olympics and won a gold medal! That’s still really awesome. I can only do what I can do, and if people want to say their stuff on social media, I can’t stop them.” Soon, however, the backlash had its own backlash, and people began tweeting the hashtag #LOVE4GABBYUSA. “That was just awesome,” she says. “It felt really good to have people support me. It was a good reminder that where there is hate, love is more.” Courtesy Proctor and Gamble Heading Home A relaxed Douglas talked with PEOPLE inside the P&> Family Home, the lounge that supported athletes and their families throughout the game. (In true post-Olympic fashion, she was eating a plate of fries.) For more of PEOPLE’s Olympic coverage, pick up our collector’s edition, The Best of the Games, on sale now. “I’m really looking forward to going home,” she says. “Just to have some family time. I can’t wait to relax and play with my two dogs.” (She has a corgi and a black lab/Rottweiler mix.) “And then the Final Five will go out on tour,” she adds. “That will be a lot of fun. It will be fun to hang out with no pressure on us!” And what’s next for Douglas? “I have a lot of opportunities,” she says. (For one: she’s the new spokesperson for Venus razors, which she makes sure to say “move like no other.”) “It was a different experience than the last Olympics, but I’m happy with it,” she says. “I can’t wait to see what’s next.” Show Full Article See Also More People Logo Homeless, Track-Running Brooklyn Sisters are Sport's Illustrated Kids' SportsKids of the Year Steph Curry Trades Autographed Jerseys with 7-Year-Old with Leukemia: ‘This Is His Wish’ Gabby Douglas Reflects On Her Rio Critics: ‘It Didn’t Ruin My Experience, But It Made It Harder’ Cubs Slugger Anthony Rizzo Sends Signed Jersey to Family Who Adopted ‘Rizzo the Dog’ Kate Upton Gets Salty on Twitter After Fiancé Justin Verlander Loses Cy Young Award Load More Stories Most Popular 1 Khloé Kardashian Joins Boyfriend Tristan Thompson for Hometown Turkey Drive Ahead of Thanksgiving 2 Homeless, Track-Running Brooklyn Sisters are Sport's Illustrated Kids' SportsKids of the Year 3 Nicole Johnson Phelps Wants Another Baby with Husband Michael: 'Of Course We Have Plans!' 4 Dennis Rodman Charged with Hit-and-Run After Freeway Incident 5 Steph Curry Trades Autographed Jerseys with 7-Year-Old with Leukemia: ‘This Is His Wish’ See Also People Facebook Tumblr Instagram Pinterest YouTube Google+ Copyright © 2016 Time Inc.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Aug 21, 2016 at 7:04PM Image source: Getty Images. When stocks break away from the broader market to surge higher, there's usually a good reason behind the move. Investors are often responding to a positive change in the company's prospects -- or at least evidence that their worst fears aren't about to come true. With that in mind, below I'll take a look at a few stocks that are beating the S&P 500 by at least 10 percentage points so far in 2016, yet could still make solid long-term investments at today's prices. Stocks on the rise Stock YTD return Forward P/E Ratio Yum! Brands 24% 25 Johnson & Johnson(NYSE:JNJ) 19% 18 Facebook 18% 31 Data source: Yahoo! Finance. YTD = year to date. P/E = price-to-earnings ratio. Facebook Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) stratospheric rise since its IPO makes more sense in context with what CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his team have accomplished lately. In just the last six months, revenue is up 60%, operating income has doubled, and net profit has nearly tripled to $3.6 billion. Image source: Facebook. The social networking giant is winning where it matters most: user engagement. The monthly active user base rose 15% last quarter, compared to Twitter's 3% uptick, even as monetization soared. Facebook's average revenue per user (ARPU) spiked 40% higher in Q2, demonstrating that executives are finding plenty of ways to deliver strong returns to advertising clients without harming the user experience. Numbers like those suggest Facebook is just scratching the surface with enhancements like video streaming, which Zuckerberg said will be "at the heart" of all of the company's services in the future. That transition should continue boosting both user engagement and ARPU over time. Yum! Brands Like most of its peers, Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM), which owns the KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell chains, is seeing a growth slowdown right now. Comparable-store sales were flat in the second quarter, compared to a 2% rise in Q1. McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) comps were cut in half over that same period, falling from 6% to 3%, and Chipotle's (NYSE:CMG) pace -- hurt by last year's food safety scare -- remained sharply negative. Image source: Getty Images. Yum!'s profits are holding up far better than rivals', though. Restaurant-level operating margins are up by more than 2 percentage points to 19% of sales. The increased earnings power has translated into 22% higher net income so far this year, compared to a 10% boost for McDonald's and a large decline for Chipotle. Even with shopper traffic weakening, Yum!'s management in July raised their full-year profit outlook. Investors can also look forward to the chain's spinoff of its China business that's scheduled for the end of October. The break should raise plenty of cash, much of which the company plans to return to shareholders over the coming months. Johnson & Johnson It's hard to blame investors for bidding up shares of medical and consumer product titan Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) this year. Sales growth is outpacing comparable companies, with Q2 results up 4%, while Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) could only manage a 2% uptick. Each of J&J's core divisions contributed to the latest gains. Consumer sales and medical device sales were up 4% last quarter, while pharmaceutical revenue spiked higher by 13%. "We continue to see good momentum," CEO Alex Gorsky told shareholders in the most recent quarterly report. The growth is part of an ultra-long-term trend that's lifted by increased spending in the $6 trillion healthcare market. J&J's strong product pipeline, which is backed by an incredible $9 billion annual budget for research and development, suggests there's no reason to expect that momentum to stall. That commitment to constant innovation helps explain why the company's profitability beats peer so soundly: Gross margin is 27% of sales, compared to 3M's 23% and P&G's 21%. JNJ Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts. Each of these stocks has grown more expensive this year -- both on an absolute basis and in terms of projected future earnings -- raising the risk that shares will drop if the companies fall short of investors' expectations. However, the spike is also a signal that the companies are succeeding in their strategies and could simply carry that positive momentum forward.

Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Visa and the rest of the corporate sponsors of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro won't be paying any taxes on the money they earn there due to a tax exemption law that's set to cost Brazil hundreds of millions of dollars. RELATED: Olympic Chefs Feeding Rio's Poor The exemption, which lasts until Dec. 31, 2017, excludes from taxes revenue generated by advertising, product sales, imports and any other activity related to the organization of the games. "It is yet another manifestation of the privileges that multinationals worldwide have today," said Antonio Martins, director of the alternative Brazilian news outlet Outras Palavras. "And it's not an isolated event, which is limited to a sports mega event," he told the BBC. Brazil has 37 million people living in extreme poverty, its economy is currently in recession and the interim government of Senate-imposed President Michel Temer has approved a fiscal austerity program. Meanwhile, the country is expected to lose about a billion dollars in tax revenue thanks to the exemption, according to BBC. RELATED: Booed at Olympics, Temer Still Thinks Govt Is 'Extraordinary' According to Naomi Fowler of the Tax Justice Network, the tax exemption on corporations is a precondition forced on any candidate to host a world sport event. “Every country must accept that they will become a tax haven for these companies during a period of time,” Fowler told the BBC. Among the main sponsor companies of Rio 2016 are Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Visa, Bridgestone, Samsung, Panasonic, Omega, Procter & Gamble, General Electric, Nissan, Globo, Nike, Microsoft and Airbnb. According to organizers, the Olympic Games are an opportunity for the host country to bring in tourists, invest in infrastructure and promote a healthy lifestyle among its citizens, but it’s also true that most countries are in debt after the games and have to undertake severe austerity measures.

In a lengthy brief filed before the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit this month, US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara said Gupta’s conduct of repeatedly tipping his business partner Raj Rajaratnam with material non-public information in “ways that furthered Gupta and Rajaratnam’s shared financial interests” remains “criminal” and he is “not actually innocent”. Bharara said Gupta’s appeals from an order denying his motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence should be rejected and he is not entitled to the relief he seeks. In May, Gupta, 66, had filed an exhaustive brief in the appeals court, arguing that the judgement of the Manhattan district court finding him guilty of insider trading “should be reversed” and his “conviction should be vacated”. Gupta’s appeal came on the back of a landmark ruling by the Manhattan appeals court that for an insider trading conviction prosecutors must show that a defendant received a personal benefit for passing illegal tips. Gupta’s lawyers have cited the ruling that led to the reversal of insider convictions of hedge-fund managers Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson in December 2014. Asserting that there is no legal basis to overturn Gupta’s verdict, Bharara said Gupta was convicted by a jury in a “fair trial” for “repeatedly and brazenly” disclosing material non-public information to Rajaratnam in violation of the fiduciary duties Gupta owed to Goldman Sachs and Procter and Gamble, companies on whose boards of directors he served. “This conduct, which was motivated by Gupta’s substantial financial entanglements with Rajaratnam and his multi-billion dollar hedge fund, is as criminal today as it was before Newman,” Bharara said. “Gupta received a fair trial before a properly instructed jury; that jury simply agreed with the government’s evidence of guilt, rejected Gupta’s proffered defences and convicted Gupta for the conduct he committed. There is no legal basis to disturb that verdict,” he said. The top federal prosecutor in Manhattan noted that at no point did the District Court instruct the jury to convict Gupta based on a Newman-invalidated “mere friendship” theory of benefit. “Indeed, the ‘friendship’ does not appear in the jury instructions at all. The District Court instead instructed the jury that tipping in furtherance of Gupta’s good and frequent business relationship with Rajaratnam would suffice under the law. Newman says nothing to the contrary,” he said. Gupta is a free man now, having completing his two-year prison term on insider trading charges in March this year. Gupta was convicted in 2012 of passing confidential boardroom information to now jailed hedge fund founder Rajaratnam. He is currently subject to a term of supervised release. Gupta’s lawyers are arguing that in the wake of the Newman ruling, the “looser standard” that Gupta would have shared confidential company information with Rajaratnam because of a “friendship or good relationship” is no longer valid. “The government tried this case and the district court instructed the jury on that prior basis. Rajat Gupta was convicted on that prior basis — and served the entirety of his prison sentence for conduct that is not criminal. Accordingly, the judgement of the district court should be reversed, and Gupta’s conviction should be vacated,” they have said.

Brian Sozzi Aug 22, 2016 4:10 PM EDT Apparently KFC is in need of some marketing during the dog days of summer. The fried chicken chain owned by Yum! Brands (YUM) , which has about 4,500 locations in the U.S., began distributing 3,000 bottles of SPF 30 sunscreen for a limited time on Monday. The kicker? The sunscreen is meant to smell like fried chicken and keep one from getting too crispy in the sun. TheStreet took several samples of the sunscreen down to people on Wall Street to gauge their reaction (video below and on our Facebook page). Some thought it smelled like chicken, others were unsure why a fried chicken joint was trying to hawk sunscreen.  It marks the second marketing stunt by KFC this year in which it has used its fast-food to infuse some fun into a common consumer product. Earlier in the year, the company debuted edible nail polish in Hong Kong that was meant to be "finger lickin' good," per the company's well-known tagline. In 2015, the company released an edible coffee cup in the U.K. that was made from a cookie and chocolate.  One could make the argument that KFC doesn't need such gimmicks to drum up business. The chain has been a solid performer for Yum! Brands this year, fueled by demand for $5 containers of fried chicken and new products such as an extra spicy blend. Same-store sales for KFC rose 2% in the first quarter, and by 1% in the second quarter.  Prev 0 of 2 Next If you liked this article you might like Closing Bell: Yum!

 A CEO says forgoing the Ivy League after high school taught him a lesson he uses to run a $3.6 billion company today Jacquelyn Smith Aug. 22, 2016, 10:17 AM 12,201 facebook linkedin twitter email print Bracken Darrell. Lift Conference videos/YouTube So many ambitious high schoolers dream of attending an Ivy League college. In fact, nearly 250,000 students in total applied to the eight Ivy schools last year, according to IvyCoach.com. In the early 1980s, Bracken Darrell found himself at a crossroads. He "really wanted to go to an Ivy League school," he told  Adam Bryant of The New York Times, but thought he'd never be able to pay for it. So instead, he went to a smaller liberal arts college — Hendrix College — in Conway, Arkansas, where he majored in English, but "took enough accounting and economics courses to move in the path I wanted, which was leadership through business." Attending a non-Ivy school as an undergraduate student ended up being a smart move for Darrell, who is now the CEO of Logitech, a technology accessories company with a market capitalization of $3.6 billion. He recently told Bryant: "Hendrix was great for me. It was very small. It was even smaller than my high school, but it was a place where I could be a big fish in a small pond. One of my lines within the company is that we want to play where we can be a big fish in a small pond. That strategy is a lot better than being a small fish in a big ocean." Later, Darrell ended up attending Harvard Business School for his MBA from 1989 through 1991. He went on to work at big companies like Procter & Gamble, General Electric, Whirlpool, and Logitech, where he joined as president of the company in 2012, and took over the CEO role in early 2013.

Jump to content Home Index Newsletter Subscriptions Back issues About me Contact me Pronunciation guide Support this site Random page Spick and span Q From Kevin Wilson: What are the origins of the expression spick and span? A It’s a strange expression, isn’t it? People have been playing about with it for several hundred years, and the words on which it was based have long since gone out of the language. The oldest form seems to have been spann-nyr, which is Old Norse for a fresh chip of wood, one just carved from timber by the woodman’s axe, so the very epitome of something new. (Nyr is our modern new, while spann is a chip, the source of our spoon, an implement that was originally always made from wood, so that wooden spoon is a retronym.) By about 1300 the Old Norse phrase had started to appear in English in the form span-new, a form that lasted into the nineteenth century. This evolved by the sixteenth century into an elaborated form similar to the modern one: spick and span new, still with the old sense of something so new as to be pristine and unused. Spick here is a nail or spike. This form seems to have been inspired by a Dutch expression, spiksplinternieuw, which referred to a ship that was freshly built, so with all-new nails and timber. It is first found in Sir Thomas North’s translation of Plutarch’s Lives in 1579, “They were all in goodly gilt armours, and brave purple cassocks apon [upon] them, spicke, and spanne newe.” By the middle of the following century, it had been shortened to our modern spick and span. It had also shifted sense to our current one, for something so neat and clean that it looks new and unused. Samuel Pepys is the first recorded user, in his diary for 15 November 1665: “My Lady Batten walking through the dirty lane with new spicke and span white shoes.” In modern times, it was borrowed in the United States by Procter and Gamble as a trademark for a household cleaning product, Spic and Span, whose spelling has led some people to wonder whether it might be a disguised racial slur, from the derogatory term Spic for a Hispanic person. That’s certainly not true, but the trademark (and the slang term) have together encouraged an alternative spelling of spic in the phrase.
