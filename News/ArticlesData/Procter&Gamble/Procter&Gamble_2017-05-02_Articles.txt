Email share share tweet email EMBED </>More News Videos <iframe width="476" height="267" src="http://abc13.com/video/embed/?pid=1942089" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> A five-gallon bucket of Tide detergent, with Vietnamese text, sells for $24 while a standard box is $13 for just one-third the size. (KFSN) KFSN By Corin Hoggard Tuesday, May 02, 2017 05:32PM FRESNO, Calif. -- The deal is hard to beat. Smart & Final's five-gallon bucket of Tide laundry detergent sells for $24. Walmart's biggest box is about one-third the size for $13, so the bucket is quite a bargain - about a 40 percent discount. But a closer look suggests it may not be exactly what you think. "I thought about buying it, and then I did my research," shopper Alex Pike said. Pike found the bucket a couple months ago and thought it was a great deal, but she decided something looked unusual, so she gave it a closer look. Some of the writing is in Vietnamese. When we peeled back a sticker, we found out it's only supposed to be sold in Vietnam. Procter & Gamble produces Tide. And when people started asking about the big buckets on social media, the company said its products don't come in five-gallon buckets for retail sale. "Being a cloth diapering mother who goes through detergent like crazy, having a five-gallon bucket for real cheap was a good deal," Pike said. A spokeswoman told ABC13's sister station Action News they have two issues with the big buckets - one is the possibility of counterfeit sales. Police in LA arrested several people last year for buying and selling fake Tide in orange five-gallon buckets. The other is a Procter & Gamble product intended for professional use in Vietnam, but it's hitting store shelves here in the United States. The spokeswoman says "P&G does not sell or authorize anyone else to sell products in five-gallon buckets to the general public." A Smart & Final spokeswoman said the company can assure customers the product is genuine. They say it "is legally imported for distribution in the United States and is safe to use." FoodMaxx sells the same buckets, and they also say they import the buckets from Vietnam. But Tide's makers say the product is meant to be used in Vietnam where the washing conditions are different than in the US, so the product may not be what American consumers are used to buying. So, we wanted to see how it compared to this typical Tide detergent. We asked the chemists at BSK Associates to find out whether the products are the same on a molecular level. We checked for phosphates, a powerful cleaning agent companies stopped using in the U.S. because of environmental concerns. EMBED More News Videos <iframe width="476" height="267" src="http://abc13.com/video/embed/?pid=1942479" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> Action News bought Tide in the five-gallon bucket and Tide in a smaller container and asked chemists to examine them down to a molecular level and see what they found. "This one also claims there's no Orthophosphate 38, so we're actually going to test the levels," Ian Huh with the lab said. And they checked for other possible differences as well. Procter & Gamble said they don't control the supply chain for the Vietnamese product, so the formula may be different and consumers like Pike may not get the results they usually get from Tide. Action News Anchor Corin Hoggard went to Smart & Final and bought Tide in the five-gallon bucket and Tide in a smaller container and asked the chemists to examine them down to a molecular level and see what they found. They started with a couple assumptions. "I wasn't sure if it was counterfeit or not, but if it was counterfeit I was anticipating there would be some kind of phosphate in it," Huh said. Manufacturers eliminated phosphates in American detergents more than 20 years ago because of environmental concerns, but the chemical compounds are not illegal in California, and they're considered a strong cleaning agent. But the spectrophotometer showed no phosphates in either product. In fact, it showed the bucket and the box both contained the same elements and compounds but in different amounts. "There was six times more surfactin in the five-gallon bucket," Huh explained. Surfactins are cleaning agents. In this case, the analysis showed a high amount of sulfates in the Vietnamese Tide. The chemists say the higher levels mean Tide from the bucket might have a different effect on your clothes than the domestic Tide. "It can result in potentially taking color out from your clothes," Huh said. The American Tide had more aluminum in it, which chemists say is often used as a water softener. So, with those results in mind, is the bucket a bargain to Alexandria Pike? "I would not go back and buy that bucket, knowing that it could dull your clothes because, in the long run, I'm not just washing my clothes," she said. "I'm washing clothes for three or four other people." The chemists, on the other hand, wanted what was left in the big bucket - but just for their whites.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman The Arbor Day Foundation Partners with General Motors, Procter & Gamble and Sustainable Brands on Tree Planting to Beautify Detroit Park Groups Participate in The Greening of Detroit Park Project SOURCE: Arbor Day Foundation DESCRIPTION: DETROIT, MI, May 2, 2017 /3BL Media/ – The Arbor Day Foundation in partnership with General Motors, Procter & Gamble and Sustainable Brands are planting 40 trees at the Greening of Detroit Park in honor of Elizabeth Gordon Sachs at 1463 East Jefferson Street on May 22. The tree planting will be done by volunteers attending the 2017 Sustainable Brands Conference — SB’17 Detroit — which is being held in Downtown Detroit May 22-25, 2017. The new trees are part of the City of Detroit’s efforts to reforest city parks and restore the tree canopy throughout Detroit. To sign up for this event please click here. “We are excited to partner with the attendees of Sustainable Brands 2017 to get these trees planted in Detroit,” said Dan Lambe, president of the Arbor Day Foundation.  “This planting project will be done completely by volunteers not from Detroit and illustrates the importance and value people place on trees and the benefits they bring to the area they are being planted.” The Greening of Detroit Park in Honor of Elizabeth Gordon Sachs was developed by The Greening of Detroit and volunteers over the past 26 years.  The redevelopment of the Detroit’s riverfront and new housing development that is planned, puts the park directly in the center for gathering space for the surrounding community. It also serves as a gateway to the adjacent Lafayette Park. “Our attendees have often told us that they wanted to be able to make a difference in the city that hosts our annual conference, and we listened,” said David Fiss, Executive Producer of Sustainable Brands.  “In collaboration with the Arbor Day Foundation, we were able to offer this unique hands-on tree planting experience.” The trees planted will not only beautify the area, but also extend the tree canopy of the park and will provide benefits such as cleaner air and water. The investment in the tree canopy will also tangentially help the park to add value to the surround real estate in the area. Over the years The Greening of Detroit Park has been home to The Greening’s Green Corps summer youth employment program. Each summer 200 high school students gather at the park before heading out to maintain over 5,000 trees, providing the critical maintenance needed. Additionally, nearby residents utilize the park to gather and host events such as yoga, jazz concerts and art displays. “Procter & Gamble is proud to partner with the Arbor Day Foundation to lead change in this community and to have a long-term impact on the environment,” said Tonia Elrod, Director, P&G Sustainability Communications. “We are pleased to help re-green the city of Detroit though this planting initiative.” About the Arbor Day Foundation The Arbor Day Foundation is a million-member nonprofit conservation and education organization with a mission to inspire people to plant, nurture, and celebrate trees.

(KFSN) KFSN By Corin Hoggard Monday, May 01, 2017 06:32PM FRESNO, Calif. (KFSN) -- The deal is hard to beat. Smart & Final's five-gallon bucket of Tide laundry detergent sells for $24. Walmart's biggest box is about one-third the size for $13, so the bucket is quite a bargain - about a 40 percent discount. But a closer look suggests it may not be exactly what you think. "I thought about buying it, and then I did my research," shopper Alex Pike said. Pike found the bucket a couple months ago and thought it was a great deal, but she decided something looked unusual, so she gave it a closer look. Some of the writing is in Vietnamese. When we peeled back a sticker, we found out it's only supposed to be sold in Vietnam. Procter & Gamble produces Tide. And when people started asking about the big buckets on social media, the company said its products don't come in five-gallon buckets for retail sale. "Being a cloth diapering mother who goes through detergent like crazy, having a five-gallon bucket for real cheap was a good deal," Pike said. A spokeswoman told Action News they have two issues with the big buckets - one is the possibility of counterfeit sales. Police in LA arrested several people last year for buying and selling fake Tide in orange five-gallon buckets. The other is a Procter & Gamble product intended for professional use in Vietnam, but it's hitting store shelves here in the United States. The spokeswoman says "P&G does not sell or authorize anyone else to sell products in five-gallon buckets to the general public." A Smart & Final spokeswoman told us the company can assure customers the product is genuine. They say it "is legally imported for distribution in the United States and is safe to use." FoodMaxx sells the same buckets, and they also say they import the buckets from Vietnam. But Tide's makers say the product is meant to be used in Vietnam where the washing conditions are different than in the US, so the product may not be what American consumers are used to buying. So, we wanted to see how it compared to this typical Tide detergent. We asked the chemists at BSK Associates to find out whether the products are the same on a molecular level. We checked for phosphates, a powerful cleaning agent companies stopped using in the U.S. because of environmental concerns. EMBED More News Videos <iframe width="476" height="267" src="http://abc30.com/video/embed/?pid=1942479" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> Action News bought Tide in the five-gallon bucket and Tide in a smaller container and asked chemists to examine them down to a molecular level and see what they found. "This one also claims there's no Orthophosphate 38, so we're actually going to test the levels," Ian Huh with the lab said. And they checked for other possible differences as well. Procter & Gamble said they don't control the supply chain for the Vietnamese product, so the formula may be different and consumers like Pike may not get the results they usually get from Tide. Action News Anchor Corin Hoggard went to Smart & Final and bought Tide in the five-gallon bucket and Tide in a smaller container and asked the chemists to examine them down to a molecular level and see what they found. They started with a couple assumptions. "I wasn't sure if it was counterfeit or not, but if it was counterfeit I was anticipating there would be some kind of phosphate in it," Huh said. Manufacturers eliminated phosphates in American detergents more than 20 years ago because of environmental concerns, but the chemical compounds are not illegal in California, and they're considered a strong cleaning agent. But the spectrophotometer showed no phosphates in either product. In fact, it showed the bucket and the box both contained the same elements and compounds but in different amounts. "There was six times more surfactin in the five-gallon bucket," Huh explained. Surfactins are cleaning agents. In this case, the analysis showed a high amount of sulfates in the Vietnamese Tide. The chemists say the higher levels mean Tide from the bucket might have a different effect on your clothes than the domestic Tide. "It can result in potentially taking color out from your clothes," Huh said. The American Tide had more aluminum in it, which chemists say is often used as a water softener. So, with those results in mind, is the bucket a bargain to Alexandria Pike? "I would not go back and buy that bucket, knowing that it could dull your clothes because, in the long run, I'm not just washing my clothes," she said. "I'm washing clothes for three or four other people." The chemists, on the other hand, wanted what was left in the big bucket - but just for their whites.

Photos Videos Topics Live WI 40/1 (14) - PAK 393/10 (140) Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Narendra Modi Donald Trump Bahubali 2 Exam results 2017 IPL 2017 News Business News Vicks touches right chord with its transgender mom ad Shares1 Collin Furtado | Wed, 3 May 2017-07:50am , DNA What makes this ad special is that it goes beyond just bringing out the issue of transgender rights in India, but manages to do it in the most heartfelt way It is very common today to see brands taking up social causes and giving social messages regarding things affecting various segments of society. However, very few brands are successful in creating a campaign or an ad film that gets a tear jerking response from people. An ad that managed to that recently was the P&G's Vicks through its new "Touch of Care" campaign. What makes this ad special is that it goes beyond just bringing out the issue of transgender rights in India, but manages to do it in the most heartfelt way. By taking up a real-life story of Indian transgender activist Gauri Sawant and her adopted daughter Gayatri, the story brilliantly brings to light how an orphan child gets more than just a mother when she is adopted by Gauri. With mother's care at the heart of the ad, it brings out the message that the care giving mother can also be a transgender. The ad agency, Publics Singapore, and P&G have done a good job by not revealing Gauri's face until the end. This brings about a normalcy of a mother caring for her child. It highlights how normal it is for a transgender person to give the touch of care of a mother. Sadly, normalcy or to be treated equally is something that transgenders have to fight for even today in a society despite the Supreme Court ruling in 2014 granting transgender citizens recognition as third gender under the law. We all know how brands use social messaging in order to get on the good graces of consumers, but this ad gives other brands a demo as to how to do. Brands are used to pushing their product or branding somewhere into the ad which more often than not ruins it, even though it may have something good to say. What truly makes this ad stand out is that it does not revolve around the 'Vicks' product or brand at all and nor does it in any way prominently push the product in the ad. Only in one scene does it subtly feature a blurred Vicks bottle in the corner of the frame. Brands and marketers definitely can learn a thing or two about content marketing and reaching out to consumers through this ad. Brands need to understand that it is not about them but the consumer that matters and making that connect with them does not always involve pushing a product down a consumers throat.

Naturally, PG shares remained muted post earnings. Let’s delve a little deeper into the results and assess what could be done with P&G shares in the coming days. Procter & Gamble’s 3Q17 Earnings in Focus The consumer staple giant’s 3Q17 adjusted earnings of 96 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.94 by 2.1%. The bottom line also increased 12% from the prior-year quarter. Currency-neutral core EPS improved 15%. P&G’s reported net sales of $15.61 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.71 billion by 0.7%. The top line also declined 1% year over year. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of 2% on sales. Organically (excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange), revenues grew 1% on the back of a 1% increase in organic volumes. Core gross margin decreased 40 bps to 50.5% as productivity cost was more than offset by headwinds like an unfavorable geographic and product mix. Management maintained its organic sales growth projection in the range of 2–3% for fiscal 2017. However, the company expects the combined foreign exchange headwind and minor brand divestitures to hurt sales by 2–3%. Hence, P&G expects all-in sales growth to remain down 1% to flat (earlier flat) for fiscal 2017. The company has beefed up its guidance for adjusted free cash flow productivity from 90% to approximately 95% for the fiscal year. 7 Blue-Chip Stocks Every Investor Should Own Thanks to mixed results, shares of PG dropped about 2.6% in the last two trading sessions (as of April 27, 2017). The loss also reflected in the ETF world, with consumer staples funds being slightly hurt. Many of the key funds in this segment have a double-digit allocation to the consumer product giant, suggesting that the performance of the fund is highly dependent on P&G’s performance. Let’s take a look at the following three ETFs with a solid allocation to Procter & Gamble (read: Consumer Staples ETF Investing 101): Next Page   1 2 View All View All   Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, http://investorplace.com/2017/05/should-you-buy-the-dip-in-procter-gamble-via-etfs/. ©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC More on InvestorPlace 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Market’s Next Big Rally 4 Popular Stocks Hitting New Lows Why Tesla Stock Should Keep Rising for Years to Come 3 Energy ETFs to Buy Today for Better Gains Tomorrow 3 Financial Stocks to Short Now 15 Things to Buy With Your Sell in May Profits ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Editor's Picks 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Market’s Next Big Rally 3 Energy ETFs to Buy Today for Better Gains Tomorrow 4 Popular Stocks Hitting New Lows 15 Things to Buy With Your Sell in May Profits 3 Financial Stocks to Short Now Most Popular 10 Simply Safe Dividend Stocks to Buy for Retirement 4 High-Yield Stocks to Buy for 6%-Plus Dividends 10 Dividend Stocks That Will Deliver Double-Digit Returns Every Year Why Apple Inc.

(GuruFocus) Investors across the world are going to be paying particularly close attention to OPEC's May 25 meeting for further signs members and non-members will expand an agreement to cut supplies through the bottom half of 2017. But investors should perhaps not stress themselves looking for the latest updates as the writing is already on the wall. According to Gadfly's Liam Denning, Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS)'s movies are more suspenseful than the upcoming OPEC meeting since OPEC has no choice but to maintain its agreement to lower oil supply for several obvious reasons. First, the U.S. Energy Information Administration released last week its updated estimates for oil supply and demand in February. The number showed that supply of oil rose 193,000 barrels a day, up from the initial estimate of 180,000 barrels a day of supply. Adding fuel to the fire, Baker Hughes weekly rig-count data showed that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States rose for the 15th consecutive weeks. In other words, production of oil in the United States is clearly rising. But while this is happening, demand for oil is falling, as evidence by a reduction of 218,000 barrels of gasoline a day consumed throughout February compared to the same month a year ago. Bottom line, OPEC has little choice but to expand its agreement, but at the same time, the effects are uncertain since Libya, an OPEC member that is exempt from the agreement, is now producing more than 700,000 barrels a day of oil. In fact, Libya could be on track to match its 1.6 million barrels a day output prior to the civil war starting.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman ChineseInvestors.com, Inc. Appoints Summer Yun as CEO of CBD Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Wholly-owned Foreign Entity SAN GABRIEL, California, May 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — ChineseInvestors.com, Inc. (OTCQB: CIIX) („CIIX” or the „Company”), the premier financial information website for Chinese-speaking investors, today announces that it has appointed Summer (XiangYang) Yun as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of its wholly-owned foreign entity, CBD Biotechnology Co., Ltd. („XiBiDi Biotech”). XiBiDi Biotech’s primary focus is online, retail and direct sales of hemp-based health products in China. Yun’s initial focus will be the launch of ‚CBD Magic Hemp Series’ cosmetics line. He will also spearhead the Company’s plan to import natural dietary supplements created using advanced extracting and purifying technologies into China. Yun is a marketing and branding executive with over 25 years of experience. Yun will report directly to CIIX’s CEO Warren Wang. „I am honored to be named as CEO of CBD Biotech,” says Yun. „For over 5,000 years, hemp has been cultivated and used in over 25,000 products worldwide. CIIX has a unique opportunity to become one of the first companies to offer CBD-based skin care products in China online and through established retail and direct selling channels. Through the introduction of Magic CBD Series cosmetics to China, I hope to educate consumers regarding hemp’s many benefits.” The CBD Magic Hemp Series line will include cleansers, moisturizing lotions and anti-aging products created using supercritical CO2 extraction technology. CBD Biotech also plans to launch a series of oral spray vitamins and supplements that can be used for relaxation, pain relief and sleep, among others things. Yun will oversee marketing and sales of these products in China, and utilizing his branding and marketing expertise, he will work to grow the CBD Biotech brand. „I believe Yun is the perfect candidate to oversee CBD Biotech’s operations. I am confident in his ability to introduce this revolutionary CBD-based skin care line to China and create and generate substantial revenue for CIIX,” says Wang. Yun served as a marketing executive for the cosmetics branch company of TianJing Department Store to introduce both Procter & Gamble and Ponds to the Chinese market. As a brand agent, Yun experienced how Procter & Gamble cooperated with GuangZhou Soap Factory to enter the Chinese market, where he introduced the Head & Shoulders and Olay brands to the Chinese market. In 1996, Yun founded Sino-US Trade Development Co., Ltd. in TianJing Development Zone, and at the same time introduced the French L’anfu Cosmetics brand and Shanghai L’anfu Cosmetics brand to the Chinese market.

(Thinkstock) Shares2 Collin Furtado | Wed, 3 May 2017-07:20am , Mumbai , DNA Here's why brands are increasingly choosing digital only video ad campaigns for marketing purpose While we have heard brands as well as ad agencies state several times the importance of the digital medium in the advertising world. However, barring a few exceptions, we have instead majorly seen TV ads which are retrofitted to digital platforms. It is not until recently that we have seen brands increasingly creating ads exclusively for the digital medium, weaving content marketing into them. These long 3 minute to even 5 minute ads are specifically created and suited to digital media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, among others. Many of these brands refrain from a shorter version of these ads on TV as common sense tells that you cannot cram a 3 minute ad into 30 seconds without losing the intended effect of the ad film. Some e digital ad campaigns which have worked well recently include P&G's Vicks 'Touch of Care' ad campaign on the depiction of the story behind Indian transgender activist Gauri Sawant and her adopted daughter Gayatri, Paperboat's 'My first train ride' which takes us to railway journey's to our grandparents place during summer vacations, Nissan India's 'An Unexpected Vistor on the Pitch', Samsung's India Service ad, Google's 'Code it Possible' ad and Red Lable's 'Taste of Togetherness' campaign. Why digital video ad campaigns It is not only these brands that have come out with only digital ad campaigns, but there are many others too that have taken this step. Brands no longer seemed to be wanting to work under the time constraint that comes with the TV medium. Parvesh Debuka, Marketing Head, Hector Beverages said, "Digital is something where we have always been building content around. Our previous films are also exclusively for digital. TV has its set of advantages and ease of access. And digital has its advantages and ease of access. This long story format which we use, where we are allowed to use 3-4 minutes of storytelling time I think digital allows you to do more stories like that." Ahmed Naqvi, CEO & Co-founder of digital agency Gozoop said that the flexibility and the no time constraints of the platform is the reason that brands are creating digital first video ad campaigns. "Most brands are now realizing that their audience is now there on digital platforms. It enable to them to target their audience accurately and gives them the RoI they look for. Digital first campaigns allow them to understand what is working and not working immediately. This allows them to correct their marketing campaign and make any course corrections, which is not possible in any other medium. We have a lot of clients that come to us for digital first video campaigns. If it works on digital then some of them even think about taking it to TV." Besides the time constants are the higher costs of the TV medium in comparison to digital. As TV ads are priced as per 10 seconds and could cost Rs 80,000 to Rs 1 lakh on some of the highest rated channels and shows, it is one of the most expensive mediums. So are the costs something to factor in? Naqvi said that this is not the primary motive why brands are turning to creating digital video ads. "Some of the brands we work with spend the same money on digital as they would on a TV ad campaign. In terms of production values too digital video ads are the same level as mainline TV ads. Even promotion ad rates on digital platforms have increased significantly over the last few years. The reason brands are choosing digital as it gives them flexibility in time and course correction. Brands get reactions from people and comments which enable them to make changes in the campaign immediately. Digital video ad campaigns are also a series of ads which run for a longer period, over weeks at times." More digital video ads using content marketing Keeping the format and the costs aside, most importantly brands and marketers in India seem to be understanding what is content marketing and how the digital medium truly works. Content marketing by definition is creating and sharing content that does not explicitly promote a brand but is intended to stimulate interest in its product or services. The magic words here are 'content that does not explicitly promote a brand'. And content marketing, if done right, works wonderfully on an interactive medium such as digital. Yet you will find many brand managers or marketers brag at advertising conferences that they "engage" their customers through content marketing on digital, when essentially what they do is create content to push their brand or product heavily down the throats of consumers. After the campaign is out they sprinkle it with a little irrelevant numbers and stats, which they get from their social media agencies, and 'voila' the marketer gets started on a PPT presentation on their successful digital media campaign. Naqvi says the use of content marketing by brands is nothing new but more widespread now. "Brand's now understand that they need to give what a consumer needs. Only when it is useful to consumers then there will be a virality of the ad. Content marketing is used by brands to push their values and create value for the consumer. In the end, it is all about getting closer to a consumer so that they recall the brand at the time of purchase," he said. DIGITAL EDGE While TV ads are retrofitted to digital platforms, digital ads are specifically created for them Digital gives brands flexibility to produce content and comes without any time constraints Firms can make any course corrections during campaigns, which is otherwise not possible Collin Furtado Info Collin Furtado brings with him over 4 years of experience in the financial reporting team.

Also, the Federal Open Market Committee began a two-day meeting during which it is not expected to raise interest rates. Investors will eye Wednesday’s post-gathering statement for any clues about the odds of a hike at their June meeting. “The Fed’s outlook is really based on economic fundamentals, and if growth and the labor market trend does not hold up, that could cause the Fed to go slower,’’ Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest-rate strategist at TD Securities in New York, told Bloomberg. “If it heats up, that could cause the Fed to roll off the balance sheet earlier.” In 2.35pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 percent. The Nasdaq Composite Index inched 0.01 percent lower. In 2.20pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.1 percent. Earlier in the day the Nasdaq touched a record high 6,102.72. The Dow rose, as gains in shares of Intel and those of Visa, recently up 1.4 percent and 1.2 percent respectively, outweighed declines of Procter & Gamble and those of JPMorgan Chase, down 1 percent and 0.8 percent respectively. Shares of Apple, which reports its latest quarterly earnings after the market close, traded 0.4 percent stronger as of 2.23pm in New York. The stock touched a record high US$148.09 earlier in the day. And the stock might continue its gains. Active stock fund managers around the world are holding the lowest percentage of Apple shares in their portfolios when compared to the iPhone maker’s overall weighting in indexes, Reuters reported, citing a research note by investment bank UBS. “Active fund managers as a whole continue to underperform their benchmarks and are not going to want to leave a lot of performance on the table if they continue to see this company rally,” Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA, an independent research firm in New York, told Reuters. While the latest round of US earnings has generally exceeded expectations so far, some disappointed. Archer Daniels Midland, the US agricultural trader, warned that massive global grain stocks are making it difficult to turn a profit trading grain internationally, Reuters reported. ADM shares sank, trading 8.4 percent weaker as of 1.19pm in New York. “We’re working very hard in ag services to continue to improve our operations. We have been or facing a couple of years of very strong headwinds into that business,” ADM Chief Executive Juan Luciano said on a conference call with analysts, according to Reuters. “With ample stocks around the world, there is a very subdued environment for us to make profitable international trades,” Luciano noted. Net profit attributable to ADM rose to US$339 million, or 59 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, up from US$230 million, or 39 cents a share, in the same quarter a year earlier, the Chicago-based company said in a statement. Shares of Mosaic also dropped, trading 7.6 percent weaker as of 1.46pm, after the US maker of fertiliser posted quarterly earnings that missed expectations amid lower phosphate and potash prices. Mosaic swung to a net loss attributable to the company of US$900,000 for the quarter ended March 31, compared with a profit of US$256.8 million, a year earlier, it said in a statement. Even so, the company is upbeat about the outlook. “We are seeing positive developments in the phosphates industry following a challenging 2016,” Joc O’Rourke, chief executive officer, said in the statement. “Realised product prices are rising, demand continues to be strong and we believe China is in the process of restructuring its industry.” “For the remainder of 2017, we expect improved margins in our phosphate business as we begin to realise the benefits of improving market conditions and completed plant maintenance,” he noted. In Europe the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a 0.8 percent gain from the previous close. Germany’s DAX Index rose 0.6 percent, as did the UK’s FTSE 100 Index, while France’s CAC40 Index added 0.7 percent.

While you were sleeping: UPDATED Wall Street rises as Apple climbs to record Margreet Dietz Wednesday May 3, 2017 Share ADM Chief Executive Juan Luciano says the agbusiness is facing strong headwinds. Play NBR radio on All three major benchmarks rose as Wall Street absorbed new corporate earnings reports. Also, the Federal Open Market Committee began a two-day meeting during which it is not expected to raise interest rates. Investors will eye Wednesday's post-gathering statement for any clues about the odds of a hike at their June meeting. "The Fed's outlook is really based on economic fundamentals, and if growth and the labour market trend does not hold up, that could cause the Fed to go slower,'' Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest-rate strategist at TD Securities in New York, told Bloomberg. "If it heats up, that could cause the Fed to roll off the balance sheet earlier." At the close of trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 36.43 points, or 0.2%, to 20,949.89. The Nasdaq Composite Index edged 0.06% higher to 6095.37, again touching a record high 6102.72, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index advanced 0.1% to 2391.17. The Dow rose, as gains in shares of Intel and those of Visa, up 1.4% and 1.2% respectively, outweighed declines of Procter & Gamble and those of JPMorgan Chase, down 1.0% and 0.8% respectively. Apple hits new high Shares of Apple, which reports its latest quarterly earnings after the market close, traded 0.4% stronger and touched a record high $US148.09 earlier in the day. And the stock might continue its gains. Active stock fund managers around the world are holding the lowest percentage of Apple shares in their portfolios when compared to the iPhone maker's overall weighting in indexes, Reuters reported, citing a research note by investment bank UBS. "Active fund managers as a whole continue to underperform their benchmarks and are not going to want to leave a lot of performance on the table if they continue to see this company rally," Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA, an independent research firm in New York, told Reuters. Energy stocks, the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 so far this year, fell 0.5% as a slide in crude prices pressured oil companies. US crude for June delivery lost 2.4% to $US47.66 a barrel, posting its second lowest settlement for the year. While the latest round of US earnings has generally exceeded expectations so far, some disappointed. Grain gluts sinks ADM Archer Daniels Midland, the US agricultural trader, warned that massive global grain stocks are making it difficult to turn a profit trading grain internationally, Reuters reported. ADM shares sank 8.4%. "We're working very hard in ag services to continue to improve our operations. We have been or facing a couple of years of very strong headwinds into that business," ADM chief executive Juan Luciano said on a conference call with analysts, according to Reuters. "With ample stocks around the world, there is a very subdued environment for us to make profitable international trades." Net profit attributable to ADM rose to $US339 million, or 59USc per share, in the quarter ended March 31, up from $US230 million, or 39USc a share, in the same quarter a year earlier, the Chicago-based company said in a statement. Mosaic books loss Shares of Mosaic dropped 7.6% after the US maker of fertiliser posted quarterly earnings that missed expectations amid lower phosphate and potash prices. Mosaic swung to a net loss attributable to the company of $US900,000 for the quarter ended March 31, compared with a profit of $US256.8 million, a year earlier, it said in a statement. Even so, the company is upbeat about the outlook. "We are seeing positive developments in the phosphates industry following a challenging 2016," Joc O'Rourke, chief executive officer, said in the statement. "Realised product prices are rising, demand continues to be strong and we believe China is in the process of restructuring its industry. For the remainder of 2017, we expect improved margins in our phosphate business as we begin to realise the benefits of improving market conditions and completed plant maintenance." Government bonds strengthened, with the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note falling to 2.296% from 2.327% on Monday.  In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a 0.8% gain from the previous close. Germany's DAX Index rose 0.6%, as did the UK's FTSE 100 Index, while France's CAC40 Index added 0.7%.

That's more than the market value of either Walmart or Procter & Gamble, according to the Wall Street Journal. Unfortunately for Apple, over 90% of this stockpile is overseas and is difficult for the company to bring home without being heavily taxed. However, the Trump administration has proposed a repatriation tax holiday to encourage companies like Apple to bring their cash back to the U.S. The stock is trading up about 27% year-to-date and closed at an all-time high of $146.58 on Monday as investors are anticipating a possible super cycle when Apple releases its 10th-anniversary edition of the iPhone this fall. The new phone is expected to feature a complete redesign, including edge-to-edge OLED display with a virtual home button. While Apple may decide to use its cash to increase its dividend to shareholders, it could also get into some M&A activity, although it typically only makes relatively smaller deals, such as when it paid $3 billion in 2014 for Beats Electronics, a maker of headphones, speakers and audio software, and Beats Music, a subscription steaming music service. However, to put into perspective just how much cash Apple has to work with, here are six crazy things it could buy with $250 billion. Click through the slideshow above to see them. Apple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio.  2/7 SLIDES © TheStreet 1. Finland - With $17.6 Billion to Spare Apple is moving employees into a brand new futuristic campus known as Apple Park this month. But if it wanted to make its offices an actual country, it could just buy Finland. The country's GDP is at about $232.4 billion, according to worldbank.org. Other counties that Apple could easily afford include New Zealand ($173.8 billion GDP), Bolivia ($33 billion GDP), Bulgaria ($50.2 billion GDP), Costa Rica ($54.1 billion GDP), Cuba ($87.1 billion GDP) and Hungary ($121.7 billion GDP). 3/7 SLIDES © TheStreet 2. Buy Every Team From the Four U.S. Major Sports Leagues - With $72.89 Billion Left Over In 2016, all 30 of the National Basketball Association's teams combined were worth about $40.6 billion, according to data from Forbes. That means Apple could buy all of the teams and have about $210 billion left over to buy up some other sports teams. Buying all 30 MLB teams would cost an additional $46.1 billion, according to data from Forbes. That still leaves over $160 billion. The 32 NFL teams would cost Apple about $74.9 billion. That still leaves $88.4 billion. Finally, the 30 NHL teams cost a combined $15.51 billion. That means Apple would still have $72.89 billion left over after buying all 122 teams in the four U.S. Major Sports Leagues. 4/7 SLIDES © TheStreet 3. Preorder 192,307 Flying Cars From AeroMobil Flying cars have been all the rage in the past few weeks ever since Kitty Hawk released footage of its flying car in action. Like many of its competitors, AeroMobil is a car that can function on the road or by air, transitioning from one to the other in less than three minutes. The exterior for the flying car was inspired by a "perfectly aerodynamic teardrop shape." As of now, AeroMobil's version of the flying car has the most expensive preorder price tag at $1.3 million, but Apple could still order 192,307 of them before they ship out in 2020. 5/7 SLIDES © TheStreet 4. Give Everyone in the U.S. $777.84 If Apple decided to be a Good Samaritan and splits its cash pile with all 321.4 million people in the U.S., then everyone would get about $777.84. That means Apple could gift everyone in the U.S. the special edition red iPhone 7 that came out in March and starts at $750 and then give them an extra $17.84 to buy themselves a case. 6/7 SLIDES © TheStreet 5. Buy Tesla, Netflix or Disney Some capital managers told the Wall Street Journal that Apple could use its money to buy Tesla, which is valued at $51 billion, to help its out with its secretive autonomous vehicle efforts. But if Apple wants to concentrate on original content, then it may want to buy Netflix, valued at $65 billion, they said. Or if Apple is feeling adventurous, it could buy Walt Disney for $180 billion. While a number of investors have been pushing for Apple to buy Netflix, the company is less thrilled about such a deal. At ReCode's Code Media conference in February, Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue said, "We might be better buying somebody or doing that, but that's not what we're trying to do. We are trying to do something that's unique. . . " In addition, Apple Music head Jimmy Iovine told Variety earlier that month that Apple Music's venture into both audio and video has "nothing to do with what Netflix is doing." 7/7 SLIDES © TheStreet 6. Buy 2,500 of Trump's private Boeing 747 Before Donald Trump was elected president of the U.S., he was a billionaire who jetted across the world on a private Boeing 757-200 airliner that cost a stunning $100 million to make, according to CNBC. Trump calls the plane the "T-Bird." He bought it in 2011 but added on features. Apple could buy 2,500 of these customized $100 million "T-Birds." Of course, Trump will eventually fly in a new Air Force One jet, whose price is currently under review from the Pentagon after Trump complained that the original $4 billion price tag was too high. But even at that price tag, Apple could buy 62.5 Air Force One jets.  7/7 SLIDES AdChoices More From The Street You're Fired: The Top 10 Most Ridiculous Reasons People Lose Their Job The Street 10 Best Places to See the Northern Lights The Street 10 Mexican Beers Targeted by the Trump Tariff The Street The Street View the full site Feedback © 2017 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter Found the story interesting?

Also new to the agency's creative team are creative director Jen Stocksmith, who joins from New York's Vayner Media, creative David Hahn, who comes from Barkley in Kansas City, and director of Periscope Creative Studio Erik Jacobs, who has previously worked at Duffy Design, Fallon and Olson.

Published on May 02, 2017. Credit: Forrester Most Popular Moves by big advertisers to pause spending on Google, audit media buying and demand greater accountability will at least dent the rise of digital ad spending and hasten what Forrester is calling "The End of Advertising As We Know It" in a report to be released today. Google's recent street-beating revenue results, despite those spending pauses that began in mid-March, may make digital ad spending growth look inevitable. But Forrester isn't buying it, projecting big advertisers will pull around $2.9 billion out of digital advertising over the next year. James McQuivey Credit: Forrester "Display advertising never worked like we pretended," Forrester's report says. "CMOs know this already, but nobody wants to talk about it." Forrester cites the familiar problems of poor-quality ad placements, barely existent clickthrough rates, non-viewable impressions and rising ad blocking. The biggest spenders, such as Procter & Gamble Co., feel those issues most, said James McQuivey, lead analyst on the report, so it's no wonder they're taking the lead in pushing back. Related Stories Alphabet Rides Mobile Ad Binge, YouTube Boycott Leaves No Mark P&G Tells Digital to Clean Up, Lays Down New Rules for Agencies and Ad Tech to Get Paid Meet the Man Behind YouTube's Sudden Ad Crisis. He Has a Patented Fix Video: James McQuivey of Forrester Research on Why CRM Is Far From Boring McQuivey likens P&G Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard's calls this year for increased transparency and accountability to "pulling on a thread" at a time when the fabric of the digital ad economy is prone to fraying. "Calling them out is step one," McQuivey said. "Pulling dollars away follows thereafter." P&G's projection last week that it will cut ad spending by $2 billion over five years, including $1 billion in media at least partly through a streamlined digital supply chain, is a clear move in that direction. So is its threat to stop spending by year end on digital properties that don't have audience verification from third parties accredited by the Media Rating Council. But in an interview, McQuivey said advertisers, rather than simply trying to reform digital advertising, should and will re-invest some of that money in emerging alternatives. He doesn't mean the TV upfront, though Forrester cites projections of a healthy 4.5% bump this year by Media Dynamics. Instead, he's talking "persistent personal assistants." Consumers already are gravitating toward "options for getting what they want without interruptions," McQuivey said, pointing to the likes of Apple's Siri, Amazon Echo, Google Home, Google Assistant and Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp chatbots . "Interruption only works if consumers spend time doing interruptible things on interruption-friendly devices," according to the report. "Once they can get what they want without leaving themselves open to interruptions – whether through voice interfaces or AI-driven background services – they will feel even more hostile to ad interruptions than they claim to be today." The same big digital players may well dominate personal assistants as dominate digital advertising, he said. And consumers will have a limited number of commercial relationships they can handle. So most brands will still need to work through hubs developed by others. But that doesn't mean everyone will have the exact same relationships or brands can't develop their own, McQuivey said. He cited Under Armour's investment in MyFitnessPal, MapMyRun and MapMyRide. A brand such as P&G's Tide could answer consumer laundry questions directly either through its own properties, something developed with one of the major digital players, or programs through appliance manufacturers like Whirlpool. "Consumers are ready for deeper relationships with the companies that matter to them," McQuivey said. "There are clear steps to take today, including embedding personality in your brand's current conversation." All this doesn't mean advertisers are "going to turn away totally" from digital advertising, McQuivey said. But they could see a pause that refreshes strategy – or depresses spending growth long term. In this article: A.I.

(CIIX: OTCQB) | ChineseInvestors.com, Inc. Appoints Summer Yun as CEO of CBD Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Wholly-owned Foreign Entity SAN GABRIEL, California, May 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — ChineseInvestors.com, Inc. (OTCQB: CIIX) („CIIX” or the „Company”), the premier financial information website for Chinese-speaking investors, today announces that it has appointed Summer (XiangYang) Yun as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of its wholly-owned foreign entity, CBD Biotechnology Co., Ltd. („XiBiDi Biotech”). XiBiDi Biotech’s primary focus is online, retail and direct sales of hemp-based health products in China. Yun’s initial focus will be the launch of ‚CBD Magic Hemp Series’ cosmetics line. He will also spearhead the Company’s plan to import natural dietary supplements created using advanced extracting and purifying technologies into China. Yun is a marketing and branding executive with over 25 years of experience. Yun will report directly to CIIX’s CEO Warren Wang. „I am honored to be named as CEO of CBD Biotech,” says Yun. „For over 5,000 years, hemp has been cultivated and used in over 25,000 products worldwide. CIIX has a unique opportunity to become one of the first companies to offer CBD-based skin care products in China online and through established retail and direct selling channels. Through the introduction of Magic CBD Series cosmetics to China, I hope to educate consumers regarding hemp’s many benefits.” The CBD Magic Hemp Series line will include cleansers, moisturizing lotions and anti-aging products created using supercritical CO2 extraction technology. CBD Biotech also plans to launch a series of oral spray vitamins and supplements that can be used for relaxation, pain relief and sleep, among others things. Yun will oversee marketing and sales of these products in China, and utilizing his branding and marketing expertise, he will work to grow the CBD Biotech brand. „I believe Yun is the perfect candidate to oversee CBD Biotech’s operations. I am confident in his ability to introduce this revolutionary CBD-based skin care line to China and create and generate substantial revenue for CIIX,” says Wang. Yun served as a marketing executive for the cosmetics branch company of TianJing Department Store to introduce both Procter & Gamble and Ponds to the Chinese market. As a brand agent, Yun experienced how Procter & Gamble cooperated with GuangZhou Soap Factory to enter the Chinese market, where he introduced the Head & Shoulders and Olay brands to the Chinese market. In 1996, Yun founded Sino-US Trade Development Co., Ltd. in TianJing Development Zone, and at the same time introduced the French L’anfu Cosmetics brand and Shanghai L’anfu Cosmetics brand to the Chinese market. Over the past 28 years, Yun has served as Chinese brand agent to many major skin and health care brands.

Trump. Photo Credit: White House. 1 Opinion  Three Months Of Donald Trump: More Of The Same – OpEd May 2, 2017 IDN 0 Comment Donald Trump, Foreign Policy, Politics, United States By IDN By Marcelo Colussi* More than three months have passed since the inauguration of Donald Trump as president of the world’s leading capitalist power: the United States of America. Nothing has changed. If someone had thought that something could change with his arrival at the White House, they were mistaken from beginning to end. Why should anything change? The rhetoric used by the tycoon during his presidential campaign could certainly have led one to imagine – mistakenly – some change of scenario. Given the current crisis experienced by the US economy, his programme appeared to be – at least in words – a promise to revive a downcast national industry. But here comes the mirage. What is downcast is the purchasing power of America’s working class, while its companies remain prosperous, very healthy, managing the outlook with prospects for the future. While it is true that, in technical accounting terms, China’s gross output has surpassed that of the United States, the latter still remains the world leader in economic, political, technological and military terms. Of the largest corporations in the world, the eleven largest have their headquarters in the United States, and 54 are the most capitalised among the first 100 on the planet. They continue to manage all domains: oil (ExxonMobil Corporation, Chevron-Texaco), communication technologies (Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Hollywood), banking (Wells Fargo & Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Berkshire Hathaway), chemicals (Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, Pfizer Inc.) and, of course, the military industry (Lockheed Martin, Boeing Company, BAE Systems Inc., Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Company, General Dynamics, Honeywell Aerospace, Halliburton. All these corporations of the industrial-military complex recorded sales of almost one trillion dollars in 2016, having also seen increases of 60% since 2010, a clear sign that the economic crisis does not count for them). There is decadence and, as has happened with every empire in history, it seems to have reached the peak of its expansion and begun its slow decline. But it is far from being a defeated empire: it continues to set the pace in many aspects. Immediately after the end of World War II, America was the great capitalist power dominating the scene. The only nation with nuclear power at the time, it accounted for 52 percent of the world’s gross product. At this point in time, it no longer holds a monopoly of the atomic bomb (at least Russia and China are its rivals in parity), and its contribution to global production has dropped to 18%. Undoubtedly, it is not continuing to expand, as it did from the middle of the 19th century and throughout the entire 20th century. Furthermore, although it is beginning to be called into question, its currency – the dollar – remains largely the universal currency, and English is still the obligatory lingua franca. Hollywood, no matter what, is the cultural referent of the planet, as much as Coca-Cola or McDonald’s. The process of neoliberal globalisation, begun in the 1970s, reconfigured the world and obviously also the capitalist system. Production and marketing became absolutely planetary: the same merchandise can be produced anywhere in the world with the same technology and distributed throughout an expanded world market. Private capital thus takes advantage of the advantages offered by the poorer countries where wages are lower and where it enjoys certain privileges, such as tax exemption, weakness or lack of environmental regulations and little or no trade union organisation of workers. In this way, a company from a rich and developed country leaves its facilities there to settle in some so-called “free zone” of the Third World, lowering production costs but not the final price of the finished product. And this product is no longer marketed only within the frontiers of the producing country, but on a world market. Under this scheme, the loser is the working class of the country from which capital originates. Capital does not lose – on the contrary, it profits even more. Considering this to be the mechanism at play, the United States began to impoverish relatively: its workers became impoverished because, in many cases, they became unemployed. Meanwhile, companies continued to profit monumentally. We have already seen the data of the military industry: more and more wars, therefore, more weapons. And the United States provides the global half of them. So there is no crisis for these mega-corporations. Let’s take as an example what was once the mecca of the automobile – the city of Detroit in the state of Michigan. By 1960, Detroit had three million inhabitants, most of them employed in automotive production. With the arrival of the process of relocation, the large US companies moved to countless locations on five continents around the globe. Detroit’s industrial working class was ruined (today, Detroit is a ghost town, with only 300,000 inhabitants), but the country’s automotive mega-corporations (General Motors, Ford, Chrysler) continued their business. Who became impoverished? The working class. Against this backdrop of impoverishment of the working masses (the voters), Donald Trump’s theatrical discourse during his campaign raised expectations. He spoke – as does every campaign candidate who sells dreams and verbal pyrotechnics – of changing that situation, of bringing the industry that had abandoned American soil back to the homeland. Undoubtedly, those fiery promises achieved their purpose: contrary to all odds, Trump won the election. But the companies did not return … nor will they return! In very good measure, his “hobby horse” for the campaign was fierce xenophobia, with promises of the expulsion of the many “Hispanics who come to steal jobs”. Construction of a wall (of which one-quarter is missing because, in fact, a fence has already been built on the border with Mexico) and the deportation of thousands of Latin Americans without documents had basically a propagandistic effect. The US economy remains very prosperous for capital, but is hardly improving for its workers. The fact is that it cannot improve, because the cycle of capitalist growth of the United States has come and gone. Its consumption far exceeds its production, so the country as a whole (population and State) is living on credit. It is Chinese and Japanese currencies that are keeping Washington’s federal budget afloat, and it is credit cards (with an average debt of 5,000 dollars per citizen) that are maintaining household economies. Who benefits from this? Obviously not the cardholders, the workers, but the banks. As with any theatrical speech by a presidential campaign candidate who sells “beads and baubles”, Donald Trump also said he would not engage in war with Syria, and that he would dampen the ever-burning conflict with Russia, the alleged preamble to a new world war (this time a nuclear war, therefore possibly the last). But, just months after taking office, we see how the industrial-military complex is continuing to decide things. The 59 cruise missiles fired on a military base in Syria or the “mother of all bombs” dropped recently in Afghanistan are proof. No president of the United States – like no president in any capitalist country anywhere on the planet – is the one who finally decides things. Strong powers whisper (or shout) in his ear what he should do. These powers have a specific name: they are those mega-corporations mentioned above. Since the middle of the last century, these mega-corporations have constituted what has been called the industrial-military complex, the main current economic activity of the United States (25 percent of its gross product). In 1997, George Kennan, a key Washington political scientist during the Cold War, said: “Were the Soviet Union to sink tomorrow under the waters of the ocean, the American military-industrial establishment would have to go on, substantially unchanged, until some other adversary could be invented. Anything else would be an unacceptable shock to the American economy”. The day a president – John F. Kennedy – dared to want to stop the war in Vietnam War, like all responses of these “big bosses”, he received a precise shot in the head. And, of course, the war in Vietnam went ahead. The 60,000 fallen US soldiers do not compare with the profits made by this military-industrial complex. That adversary which must be invented, by the way, does not fail to appear continuously: “Islamic terrorism”, “drug trafficking” or any new demon that may occur in the future (rogue states, maras (gangs), dengue transmitting mosquitoes, as in the Guaraní Aquifer on the triple Argentine-Paraguayan-Brazilian border, the” Castro-Communist dictatorship of Venezuela”, and so on). The military industry, which directly or indirectly employs one in four American workers, will not stop. Trump’s fanciful declarations prior to occupying the White House spoke of “reassurance” in the current undeclared – but real and effective – new Cold War (35,000 dollars a second spent on armaments worldwide). Recent military operations in Syria and Afghanistan show the reality. It is to be hoped that we will never arrive at a new world war with nuclear weapons. In that case, only the cockroaches could tell what follows (if any survive). The capital that leads the world is voracious, but not crazy. It will surely continue to manipulate public opinion, terrorising populations and showing apocalyptic images of a probable atomic confrontation, even if it never reaches the point of pressing the fateful buttons of pandemonium. But the need to “be ready for the hecatomb”, according to the well-oiled capitalist communication industry, means that the Roman maxim “If you want peace, prepare for war” remains valid. And the industrial-military complex continues to make millions. Why would Donald Trump be any different? Perhaps he has a different style, different from the political correctness of his predecessors, but it is already clear how things are after just three months: more of the same! It’s that simple … or pathetic. * Born in Argentina, Marcelo Colussi studied psychology and philosophy and now lives in Guatemala, where he is a university professor and social researcher.

News Money Apple has a quarter-trillion dollars in cash 5 years ago, Apple had 'just' $110.2 billion By PAUL R.

Apple had more than a quarter of $1 trillion in cash and investments on its balance sheet for the first time ever. To be precise (and remember all of this is in billions with a B): Apple had $256.8 billion in its cash stockpile at the end of its the most recent quarter, up from $233 billion at the same time last year. Apple's stack of Franklins, Grants and Jacksons has steadily grown over the past few years. Five years ago, Apple had "just" $110.2 billion in cash. And Apple has increasingly stashed away most of its cash overseas for tax purposes. Apple CFO Luca Maestri said in February that $230 billion of its cash was held abroad. But there are growing hopes that Apple might soon be able to bring back, or repatriate, this cash to the United States at a one-time lower tax rate if President Trump is able to get his tax plan through Congress. Apple could use the cash to hire more workers, build more plants, make acquisitions, repurchase stock and boost its dividend. Some argue that if Apple and other tech giants were allowed to bring back cash to the U.S., it could stimulate the entire economy. To put into context just how much money a quarter trillion really is, consider the following. Apple's cash, if it were its own company, would be the 11th largest firm in the S&P 500. Besides Apple, Google owner Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and General Electric have market valuations higher than $250 billion. And Apple's cash is worth only slightly less than all of GE. It's also worth more than well-known blue chips AT&T, Walmart, Home Depot, Coca-Cola and Disney. (AT&T is in the process of acquiring CNNMoney owner Time Warner. By the way, Apple's cash is worth more than three times Time Warner's market value.) Apple's pot of gold, so to speak, is also worth more than Bank of America, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, Visa, Verizon and Comcast. Want more mind-boggling comparisons? $250 billion in cash is about 10 times the market value of Snapchat parent Snap. It is 3.5 times the valuation of Uber, and 20 times that of Twitter. It's also nearly 50 times the market cap of BlackBerry, the former king of mobile phones that is now focusing more on software.

The Apple headquarters at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California. The Apple headquarters at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California. The Apple headquarters at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California. Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple and serves on its Board of Directors. Before being named CEO in August 2011, Tim was Apple's Chief Operating Officer and was responsible for all of the company's worldwide sales and operations. By Paul R. La Monica and Seth Fiegerman NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- The bank of Apple just hit a major milestone. Apple had more than a quarter of $1 trillion in cash and investments on its balance sheet for the first time ever. To be precise (and remember all of this is in billions with a B): Apple had $256.8 billion in its cash stockpile at the end of its the most recent quarter, up from $233 billion at the same time last year. Apple's stack of Franklins, Grants and Jacksons has steadily grown over the past few years. Five years ago, Apple had "just" $110.2 billion in cash. And Apple has increasingly stashed away most of its cash overseas for tax purposes. Apple CFO Luca Maestri said in February that $230 billion of its cash was held abroad. But there are growing hopes that Apple might soon be able to bring back, or repatriate, this cash to the United States at a one-time lower tax rate if President Trump is able to get his tax plan through Congress. Apple could use the cash to hire more workers, build more plants, make acquisitions, repurchase stock and boost its dividend. Some argue that if Apple and other tech giants were allowed to bring back cash to the U.S., it could stimulate the entire economy. To put into context just how much money a quarter trillion really is, consider the following. Apple's cash, if it were its own company, would be the 11th largest firm in the S&P 500. Besides Apple, Google owner Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and General Electric have market valuations higher than $250 billion. And Apple's cash is worth only slightly less than all of GE. It's also worth more than well-known blue chips AT&T, Walmart, Home Depot, Coca-Cola and Disney. (AT&T is in the process of acquiring CNNMoney owner Time Warner. By the way, Apple's cash is worth more than three times Time Warner's market value.) Apple's pot of gold, so to speak, is also worth more than Bank of America, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, Visa, Verizon and Comcast. Want more mind-boggling comparisons? $250 billion in cash is about 10 times the market value of Snapchat parent Snap. It is 3.5 times the valuation of Uber, and 20 times that of Twitter. It's also nearly 50 times the market cap of BlackBerry, the former king of mobile phones that is now focusing more on software.

Vanity Fair hive Sign In/Up business technology politics the players hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Magazine Search Business Politics Technology The Players Sign In/Up Warren Report The Shocking Reality of America’s Human Rights “Hell” Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Warren Report The Shocking Reality of America’s Human Rights “Hell” The Marshall Project details the daily barbarity that often goes unseen. (A version of this column originally appeared on Poynter.org.) by James Warren, Chief Media Writer, Poynter.orgMay 2, 2017 10:30 am Email Facebook Twitter John Moore/Getty Images. Covering Donald Trump is not hell. Nor is an inability to procure sufficient access to reclusive Trump Cabinet members. Those are trifling, first-world travails. It’s being screwed and stuck, unnoticed, in most local jails, as The Marshall Project reminds in Just another week in hell by Ken Armstrong, a Pulitzer Prize-winner who’s been an investigative reporter at the Chicago Tribune and The Seattle Times. The Marshall Project is a wonderful, if often melancholy, chronicle of criminal justice by an evolving, high-quality nonprofit. Armstrong’s latest effort opens with a succinct description of the pedestrian daily barbarity around us: “In San Jose, California, three jail guards stood trial this week, charged with beating an inmate to death, ripping his spleen nearly in half. In northeast Arkansas, two supervisors at a juvenile lockup pleaded guilty to conspiring to pepper-spray kids without cause. And in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, an inquest revealed that jail guards cut off water to an inmate’s cell seven days before he died of dehydration.” “At The Marshall Project, we regularly check in with newspapers around the country, collecting stories and links for Opening Statement, our daily email, and for The Record, our ‘searchable encyclopedia for criminal justice journalism.’ This week we couldn’t help but be taken aback by the litany of horrors in county jails and juvenile detention centers, most of them inflicted on the mentally ill and minors.” The dehumanizing reality in lockups, including suicides, has received a fair bit of attention, this concedes. But it wraps up its own litany of a mere five days of “stunning misconduct by keepers and contempt for the kept.” And this focuses just on local lockups, not state prisons. If it had, “this week’s coverage would include a story in St. Louis, in which a mentally ill inmate hanged himself while one guard surfed Twitter, Amazon, Facebook and LinkedIn, and another guard streamed the movie ‘Blue Streak’ on Netflix, and a story in Sacramento, Calif., in which officers pepper-sprayed a mentally [ill] inmate and strapped him, naked, to a gurney for 72 hours.” No, it just focuses on local lockups. Do you even know where any are in your community? For most, they might as well be in Lithuania. Armstrong knows the locations of many, having long reported on the criminal justice system. It’s not an easy task, in part since it can easily inspire rank cynicism amid intractable ills and the inattention of readers (and, sometimes, editors). Bill Keller, Marshall Project’s editor in chief and former executive editor of The New York Times, said Monday that “one of the dangers of covering dark places is that you get jaded.” But, he notes, “Ken Armstrong will never be jaded. He’s seen it all before, but he still pays attention.” Bidding farewell to Shine So now longtime Rogers Ailes lieutenant Bill Shine is gone, too. So “Why did the Murdochs finally throw Shine under the bus, if well-wrapped in dollar bills?” (TheStreet) “Here, the playbook is clear as it was in the wake of O’Reilly’s ouster. They have a history of overextended loyalty to those who have built the empire; a good quality in moderate doses. So they delay, delay, delay and often times, the ill winds die down. When they don’t, they do what needs to be done. Empire first.” Fox’s own online story was predictably discreet. A limited range of opinions Daniel McCarthy, a writer at large for the American Conservative who tweets at @ToryAnarchist, responded to the kerfuffle over the first effort by New York Times op-ed columnist Bret Stephens by tweeting, “Problem with columnists at NYT, WaPo, etc. is their ideological range somehow omits both Trump & Sanders views — every day is Clinton vs. Bush.” (@ToryAnarchist) There’s a bit of truth embedded there. A bit. But what would a Trump point of view consist of, given his mish-mash of declarations? A very fluid, twice-a-week defense of contradictory positions promoted as some new pragmatism. Good luck with that. Will Fox buy Tribune? Chicago-based Tribune Media owns 42 TV stations, including 14 Fox affiliates, as well as WGN America and Tribune Studios. Reports indicate the Murdochs’ interest in grabbing Tribune, with the reports pushing up Tribune’s stock. There’s a bigger-is-better logic to a deal but also a case to be made against it that reflects an economic determinist portrait of Rupert Murdoch that is not especially new. (TheStreet) A big get Cheddar, the business news service for millennials, scored an interview with David Solomon, the president and co-COO of finance giant Goldman Sachs on why culture matters in business and how it’s been a culture of innovation, teamwork and innovation. How does that translate to business with Silicon Valley? (Cheddar) He explains that, noting the company’s tradition of innovation in finance and the technology of finance. He also notes how it’s focusing on a loan platform (called Marcus) that’s partly for millennials, and how disruption has come to the giant and how it tries to use technology to be better, faster and smarter for its clients. Fake news et al. Last night at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, journalists Susan Glasser of Politico, Brian Stelter of CNN and Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post engaged in a thoughtful and understated discussion of the state of the press, impact of technology, Donald Trump setting the media agenda, among other issues, in an inartfully titled “Defining truth in modern politics” session. (YouTube) Stelter spoke of “prison bubbles” and the outright hatred that many Americans have of the press (in part after hearing **Sean Hannity’**s radio show on his way to the event). He brought up the role of TV ratings in a smart way; admirably cited the B.S. (my term, not his) of cable news’ bare bones and misleading identifications of many guests and pundits; and conceded he was a millennial who doesn’t know how to use Instagram Stories. Glasser evoked a bygone era in which there were actual arbiters of facts, compared to one where “chaos and anarchy of the media moment” rein, and the unintended consequences of a world in which there’s more good information (and political reporting) than ever. She was good, too, on the success and future of niche, high-end media, if not more general interest journalism. Kessler, a former White House reporter and now the Post’s chief fact-checker, underscored how Americans are not exploiting technological change, and the access to lots of information, to read opposing views. He talked about the shift from laptop to mobile and the frustration of not necessarily impacting with facts those of differing views. There was no grand finale consensus on anything. But it was well-paced and, amid so much of the crap around us, old-fashioned smart. The take from Storm Lake Shortly before they started in Philadelphia, I’d just called Art Cullen, editor of the Storm Lake, Iowa Times, who just won the Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing. He’s a man of the left in a small town in Northwest Iowa, and I just wanted to shoot the breeze. He agreed that many journalists in big towns may underestimate the deep level of mistrust toward them. It’s a resentment of most institutions but the media is right up there. And, as he read tweets from journalists at the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner Saturday night, he rolled his eyes over “how gratuitous it was.” “They don’t get it,” he said. “They shouldn’t be there. If they’re serious about journalism, and they are, don’t show up in a party gown. Especially now, it gives me the wrong taste in my mouth right now. I’d start there and say, ‘We shouldn’t be here.’” Headline of the day “Comcast under fire for using bullshit fees to covertly raise rates” (TechDirt) Apple’s mountain of cash “Apple Inc. is expected to report Tuesday that its stockpile of cash has topped a quarter of a trillion dollars, an unrivaled hoard that is greater than the market value of either Wal-Mart Stores Inc. or Procter & Gamble Co. and exceeds the foreign-currency reserves held by the U.K. and Canada combined.” (The Wall Street Journal) The greatest heavyweight fights The heavyweight boxing champ was once the most famous athlete in the world. No longer. Can you even name the champ? Well, as 90,000 people who packed London’s Wembley Stadium can now attest, it’s Brit Anthony Joshua, who took the title from Ukrainian Wladimir Klitschko in a bloody and exciting bout that prompted Sports on Earth to give its debatable list of the 10 greatest fights ever, starting with the fabulous “Thrilla in Manilla” between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier and, then, well, it’s a debatable list, with its No. 2 a 1909 fight for which there’s no video. Privacy in Silicon Valley Silicon Valley, the comedy about the tech industry, is in its fourth season and just took on the “heated privacy debate” Sunday. (The Verge) “On the show, newly minted CEO Dinesh takes the reins of PiperChat, the video chat app that emerged from the smoldering remains of Richard’s failed idea for a platform. Little did Dinesh know that the terms of service he failed to import into his new chat app contained a very important legal protection.” He’s violated the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, which aims to protect those under the age of 13 from using services that could collect information on them and be sold to third parties. He could be liable for $25 billion in fines. And “while the show plays up the idea that PiperChat is becoming a haven for child predators, the real connection to the tech industry is around the ethics of data collection.” Imagine if the North Korea guy apes Trump Is a bump in Twitter activity attribute to Trump? That’s unclear, but “we’d love it if every world leader used Twitter as their primary mechanism to talk to their constituencies,” Twitter Chief Operating Officer Anthony Noto said. “The more that happens, the better we are going to be at showing what’s going on in the world.” (Bloomberg) A quick 180-degree turn “Hours after CNN reported on an internal Peace Corps email that announced a plan to stop supporting the former first lady’s ‘Let Girls Learn’ program, a White House spokesman said there had been no changes to the initiative.” (The Washington Post) The morning babble Flush with Trump saying its “ratings have gone through the roof,” Fox & Friends pushed the “liberal apocalypse” control room tape and went heavy with “violent” (liberals and “self-proclaimed anarchists”) May Day tumult in Portland, Oregon, Los Angeles, Chicago and New York City. I jammed a kitchen table against my front door. CNN New Day went more wonkish, on Trump’s risky healthcare initiative, with some raising the possibility of a deal by week’s end if pre-existing condition issues can be resolved. But Bloomberg’s Jennifer Jacobs, who interviewed Trump Monday, said “it was hard to tell” what Trump meant on some rather key matters. MSNBC’s Morning Joe rolled tape of Trump’s latest odd, contradictory and historically errant comments, as well as his dismissive finale to a weekend CBS interview with John Dickerson. Its pre-breakfast post-mortem was undisguised: The guy’s got a screw loose, with Mika Brzezinski exhibiting the seemingly worried, patronizing concern of a license-less psychologist: “I’m not sure he’s OK,” she said, with mournful mien, especially as Trump reaches out to North Korea’s nutbag dictator.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 May 2017 by Persistence Market Research Throat Lozenges Market Estimated to Experience a Hike in Growth by 2021 Throat lozenges, commonly known as cough sweet, cough drop, cachou or troche, are small sized medicated tablets. Lozenge word is used for diamonds that are rhombus in size. Throat lozenges are diamond shaped and these tablets get easily dissolved in the mouth and help relieve temporarily from coughs and other throat problems. It helps soothe and lubricate tissues of throat that are affected from influenza or common cold. Throat lozenges are utilized since ages (1000 BC) for treating throat infection. The first throat lozenges were made in Egypt with the utilization of various ingredients such as honey, herbs, citrus and spices. These tablets were further modified by Smith Brothers in 1852 as cough drops and in 1879 by Luden. The modification included the addition of heroin and morphine in small quantity to enhance the efficiency of the actions of throat lozenge. A sample of this report is available upon request @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/5726  In current scenario of the market throat lozenges are composed of an anesthetic, benzocaine and eucalyptus oil.  Pectin or zinc gluconate glycine is utilized while manufacturing non-menthol throat lozenges. Most of the throat lozenges also contain dextromethorphan. Various brands are available in the market for throat lozenges that include CÄ“pacol, Butter-Menthol, Chloraseptic, Gorpils, Fisherman’s Friend, Halls, Lockets, Läkerol, Pastilles Juanola, Luden’s, Ricola, Robitussin, Strepsils and Smith Brothers. Some other brands are Tunes, Vigroids, Vicks, Victory V, Sucrets and CVS Throat Drops. Throat lozenges are advised to patients suffering from pharyngitis (sour throat). Pharyngitis may be caused due to either virus or bacterial infection (streptococcus infection). It is opined by the medical professionals that approximately 50% of sore throat is caused by viral infections and 15% to 20% occurs due to bacterial infections. Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia pneumonia are some of the bacteria that cause sore throat. Symptoms that occur in a patient suffering from sore throat include redness of throat, swollen throat and difficulty in swallowing. The growth of the market for throat lozenges will be driven by aging population since elderly people often suffer from throat infection that increase the uptake of throat lozenges. It has been projected by the World Health Organization (WHO) that by 2050 nearly 2 billion populations will belong to geriatric population and it also estimated that global elderly population was 524 million in 2010. Similarly, increasing number of HIV patients across the globe also propels the growth of throat lozenges market since HIV patients usually suffer with throat infection. Similarly, rising incidences cold and coughs will also augment the growth of throat lozenges market. In addition, changing lifestyle will further support the growth of throat lozenges market since new lifestyle is responsible for reducing immunity of the body. North America in 2012, accounted for the largest share of global throat lozenges market due to presence of large number of throat lozenges manufacturers. Also, due to cold temperature in the nations such as U.S. and Canada, accentuate the incidences of cold and cough in population and in turn boost the growth of throat lozenges market in the region. Europe accounted for the second largest share of the global throat lozenges market owing to the presence of large geriatric population. Asia-Pacific and Rest of the World accounted for the smallest share of global throat lozenges market To view TOC of this report is available upon request @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/toc/5726 .The major players operating in the throat lozenges market include GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited, SSL International, Thornton & Ross, Pfizer, Inc. and Procter & Gamble (P&G) amongst other significant players worldwide.

Here's our morning roundup of all the media news you need to know. Want to get this briefing in your inbox every morning? Subscribe here. Covering Donald Trump is not hell. Nor is an inability to procure sufficient access to reclusive Trump Cabinet members. Those are trifling, first-world travails. It's being screwed and stuck, unnoticed, in most local jails, as The Marshall Project reminds in "Just another week in hell" by Ken Armstrong, a Pulitzer Prize-winner who's been an investigative reporter at the Chicago Tribune and The Seattle Times. The Marshall Project is a wonderful, if often melancholy, chronicle of criminal justice by an evolving, high-quality nonprofit. Armstrong's latest effort opens with a succinct description of the pedestrian daily barbarity around us: "In San Jose, California, three jail guards stood trial this week, charged with beating an inmate to death, ripping his spleen nearly in half. In northeast Arkansas, two supervisors at a juvenile lockup pleaded guilty to conspiring to pepper-spray kids without cause. And in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, an inquest revealed that jail guards cut off water to an inmate’s cell seven days before he died of dehydration." "At The Marshall Project, we regularly check in with newspapers around the country, collecting stories and links for Opening Statement, our daily email, and for The Record, our 'searchable encyclopedia for criminal justice journalism.' This week we couldn’t help but be taken aback by the litany of horrors in county jails and juvenile detention centers, most of them inflicted on the mentally ill and minors." The dehumanizing reality in lockups, including suicides, has received a fair bit of attention, this concedes. But it wraps up its own litany of a mere five days of "stunning misconduct by keepers and contempt for the kept." And this focuses just on local lockups, not state prisons. If it had, "this week’s coverage would include a story in St. Louis, in which a mentally ill inmate hanged himself while one guard surfed Twitter, Amazon, Facebook and LinkedIn, and another guard streamed the movie 'Blue Streak' on Netflix, and a story in Sacramento, Calif., in which officers pepper-sprayed a mentally inmate and strapped him, naked, to a gurney for 72 hours." No, it just focuses on local lockups. Do you even know where any are in your community? For most, they might as well be in Lithuania. Armstrong knows the locations of many, having long reported on the criminal justice system. It's not an easy task, in part since it can easily inspire rank cynicism amid intractable ills and the inattention of readers (and, sometimes, editors). Bill Keller, Marshall Project's editor in chief and former executive editor of The New York Times, said Monday that "one of the dangers of covering dark places is that you get jaded." But, he notes, "Ken Armstrong will never be jaded. He's seen it all before, but he still pays attention." Bidding farewell to Shine So now longtime Rogers Ailes lieutenant Bill Shine is gone, too. So "Why did the Murdochs finally throw Shine under the bus, if well-wrapped in dollar bills?" (TheStreet) "Here, the playbook is clear as it was in the wake of O'Reilly's ouster. They have a history of overextended loyalty to those who have built the empire; a good quality in moderate doses. So they delay, delay, delay and often times, the ill winds die down. When they don't, they do what needs to be done. Empire first." Fox's own online story was predictably discreet. A limited range of opinions Daniel McCarthy, a writer at large for the American Conservative who tweets at @ToryAnarchist, responded to the kerfuffle over the first effort by New York Times op-ed columnist Bret Stephens by tweeting, "Problem with columnists at NYT, WaPo, etc. is their ideological range somehow omits both Trump & Sanders views — every day is Clinton vs. Bush." (@ToryAnarchist) There's a bit of truth embedded there. A bit. But what would a Trump point of view consist of, given his mish-mash of declarations? A very fluid, twice-a-week defense of contradictory positions promoted as some new pragmatism. Good luck with that. Will Fox buy Tribune? Chicago-based Tribune Media owns 42 TV stations, including 14 Fox affiliates, as well as WGN America and Tribune Studios. Reports indicate the Murdochs' interest in grabbing Tribune, with the reports pushing up Tribune's stock. There's a bigger-is-better logic to a deal but also a case to be made against it that reflects an economic determinist portrait of Rupert Murdoch that is not especially new. (TheStreet) A big get Cheddar, the business news service for millennials, scored an interview with David Solomon, the president and co-COO of finance giant Goldman Sachs on why culture matters in business and how it's been a culture of innovation, teamwork and innovation. How does that translate to business with Silicon Valley? (Cheddar) He explains that, noting the company's tradition of innovation in finance and the technology of finance. He also notes how it's focusing on a loan platform (called Marcus) that's partly for millennials, and how disruption has come to the giant and how it tries to use technology to be better, faster and smarter for its clients.

Published on May 02, 2017. Most Popular Credit: istock A marketer with a large portfolio of household and health brands recently voiced concerns to an industry executive about whether Accenture could objectively audit its media and determine its agencies' current digital approach. The worry for the marketer: Since the consultancy plays in that space itself, can its recommendations be trusted? "Accenture has its fingers in several different pies, which is cause for concern," this person said under condition of anonymity. As Accenture, Deloitte and other consultancies wade deeper in Madison Avenue's client pool and pick up advertising work, another of their business practices—media audits—is coming too close for comfort for ad agencies. Though major consulting companies say they have firewalls to separate their businesses, agencies are griping that doing media audits of agencies for marketers gives Deloitte and Accenture an unfair advantage. If their auditors are privy to agencies' data and economics, the advertising and media side of their businesses can use that information to beat agencies at their own game. Open Question >> "Whereas the auditor or agency adviser in the past was valued for their independence, with some of these lines having become blurred it is calling their impartiality in question," said Maarten Albarda, CEO of the marketing consultancy Flock Associates USA. MediaLink Chairman-CEO Michael Kassan put it more bluntly: "You can't have a fox in the henhouse," he said. "This is potentially the most egregious example of someone grading their own homework." As mistrust grows, a number of agencies have shown increased desire to approve who audits them, adding language to contracts that say the auditor must not be in competition with them, according to a consultant with knowledge of the matter who declined to name any. When asked to respond, Accenture said it "recognizes that it has a unique model whereby it offers media auditing services and is also a digital ad agency. In both cases we are responding to the business challenges and issues brought to us by our digitally thinking clients." While Accenture's media auditing practice is led out of its Media Management unit, which is separate from its agency business, Ad Age has learned that agencies have been trying to sway marketers away from working with the company on media audits as it has moved more into programmatic service offerings. In March, Accenture Interactive announced that it plans on working with clients to help them bring digital media buying in-house, further threatening the place of media agencies in the ecosystem. "Accenture Media Management, which conducts media audits on behalf of marketer clients, and Accenture Interactive, the digital agency, are separate arms of the company—offering very separate services and solutions to clients," Accenture said. "Media audits are conducted by a dedicated team and confidential data protections are in place to ensure that information is not shared across other parts of Accenture's business." Deloitte houses a separate agency business under the name Deloitte Digital and conducts media spending audits out of Deloitte Risk & Financial Advisory, which is part of a different legal entity. "As a multi-disciplinary organization, we have formal governance structures and strict policies regarding the handling of confidential client information," said a Deloitte spokesman. "Consistent with our deep commitment to our clients, adherence to these policies is at the core of our culture." The consulting giant also audits agencies from a financial perspective, including serving as WPP's external auditor since 2002. Procter & Gamble Co. Chief Brand Officer and Association of National Advertisers Chairman Marc Pritchard said he has heard of media auditors who are part of organizations that also provide agency services, and he has his doubts about the practice. "It's really up to the parties involved," Pritchard said. But asked whether P&G would hire an auditor in those circumstances, he said, "That's a little shaky to me. If that was necessary, I would need to make sure there were enough controls, and they had independence. Certainly in the U.S., there's plenty of competition in the audit space, so you don't need to work with someone who's conflicted." Consultants aren't the only players doing media audits and raising eyebrows at agencies. Specialist agencies in media auditing also tend to do agency-relationship consulting, and that's led some agencies to resist letting them get into the books too, said Manuel Reyes, CEO of Miami-based audit and consulting firm Cortex Media and a former agency executive himself. But Reyes said that while he does consult with clients on compensation for their media agencies in addition to doing audits, he doesn't get into financial details outside of the media transactions in the audits or areas like agency employee compensation. While the audits by necessity mean understanding agency-client compensation arrangements, they don't have to include details such as what agencies are paying their staff. And agency-client compensation data can be gleaned other ways, such as benchmarking exercises with clients. As far as letting an audit firm that's also associated with providing media-buying services look into their media transactions, Reyes said, "I can't see why an agency in their right mind would let them through the door." But Reyes has also found that some agencies, particularly WPP, prefer or require having media auditors from the Big Four accounting firms do the audits rather than media consultants. Ostensibly, Reyes said, that's over concerns about firms doing agency-pitch and compensation consulting getting internal data on agency costs. But he said he believes the real reason is: "Why let some specialist come in and go through your books when you can have a 23-year-old with an accounting degree come in and do the same who doesn't know a rat's ass about media?" "Across both media auditing and financial auditing, it is important to have appropriately qualified professionals doing the work," WPP's GroupM said in a statement. "The merits of having only appropriately credentialed financial auditors doing financial auditing is self-evident. Use of companies other than the Big Four for financial auditing happens in some circumstances as a matter of agreement between GroupM and its clients. It's important that partners share confidence in the integrity of any sort of auditing work and that is always our goal." There are other signs that auditors are facing growing scrutiny themselves: The Media Rating Council, which accredits a variety of third-party media measurements, has begun looking into the media auditing space. "As of now, in the project stage, we're not looking to accredit media auditors," said MRC CEO George Ivie. "All we're trying to do is set the ground rules. We are talking about having a governance process, where maybe they have peer review, or maybe the [Association of National Advertisers] gets involved in some kind of oversight." MRC members include 25 to 30 agencies that themselves might be subject to media audits, so getting involved in auditing the auditors would "create kind of a weird dynamic," Ivie said. ANA CEO Bob Liodice said in an email that governance discussions regarding media auditors are so preliminary that it's "way too early to get excited about any option at this point." "We have certainly heard from some of our clients directly that they are questioning the wisdom of sharing their client data, media or agency pricing and other proprietary content with consultancies who are now themselves at the same time digital media management companies, data companies or creative agencies," said Flock's Albarda. The upshot: Some think consultancies will have to eventually shut down their media audit arms, which would allow them to solve their conflict-of-interest issues and focus on more lucrative parts of their business. In fact, R3 Principal Greg Paull said Accenture's media auditing is becoming a lower margin business for the company. "We doubt they would make a decision to invest in it with the same energy and spirit as other digital areas," he said. Open QUESTION Accenture was recently tapped to build and audit a new platform developed by Turner, Fox Networks Group and Viacom to standardize audience buying on TV. Dubbed OpenAP, the platform is designed to make it easier for agencies to buy more specific audiences than traditional Nielsen age and sex demographics allow. "We are going to be that credible, independent third party that provides the transparency, the consistency, the scalability and the security required to make this a success," Accenture's managing director, Farshad Family, said at an OpenAP event last month. But media buyers are concerned about Accenture's role in OpenAP—particularly how much access to data the company will have. "Accenture has a lot of different parts to their business, and while they will say it is all disconnected, it is all part of the same company," one agency executive said. "Accenture Interactive is a full-service digital agency going out and pitching business. Today, it is not a big threat to us or our holding company, but we have found ourselves pitching against Accenture." With Accenture acting as an agency, there is some concern that it could get its hands on the data that passes through OpenAP and use it for itself. "Certainly, an agency would give pause to send data Accenture's way," the executive said. "It is still unclear to me what exactly Accenture is doing as it relates to the data." Accenture said there is no crossover. "The team that will build and run OpenAP Platform is independent and separate from Accenture Interactive—just as our media audit business is run separately from Accenture Interactive," the company said. OpenAP founding members wrote in a statement to Ad Age: "Accenture and OpenAP will have no access to data other than from Nielsen and ComScore." —Jeanine Poggi Back to top In this article: Adages Agencies Regulation Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2017 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Dr. Alan J. Bauman Named One of America’s “Top Five Transformative CEOs” in Forbes Dr. Alan J. Bauman It has been such an honor to help lead the way in educating consumers, the beauty industry, as well as my fellow medical colleagues on hair transplant technology and artistry, which are continually changing and evolving. Past News Releases RSS Boca Raton, Florida (PRWEB) May 02, 2017 Dr. Alan J. Bauman, founder and CEO of Bauman Medical in Boca Raton, has been named one of the country’s most transformative CEOs in Forbes.com by contributor and nationally syndicated radio host, Robert Reiss. Dr. Bauman was recognized for his role in reinventing the hair restoration industry over the past 20 years. Dr. Bauman has become internationally-known for both his pioneering work with new technology, including minimally-invasive no-linear-scar “F.U.E.” or Follicular Unit Extraction and other microsurgical hair transplants, low level laser therapy, „PRP” or platelet-rich plasma therapy, prostaglandin analogs, trichology for hair and scalp health, 3D-printed hair and scalp „CNC” cranial prosthetics and most recently, robotic-assisted ARTAS FUE hair transplantation. This pioneering work, in addition to his practice’s Core Values and Patient-First approach to hair restoration and hair loss prevention, have helped to distinguish Dr. Bauman’s medical practice over the decades. “Everyone at Bauman Medical is so excited by this amazing recognition,” commented Dr. Bauman. “It has been such an honor to help lead the way in educating consumers, the beauty industry, as well as my fellow medical colleagues on hair transplant technology and artistry, which are continually changing and evolving. Our favorite reward however is seeing how our patients lives are forever transformed by the work we perform.” “When identifying transformative CEOs, we look for business leaders who are reinvigorating a company, reinventing an industry or rebooting society,” explained Robert Reiss, Forbes contributor and author of The Transformative CEO. “Through his tireless innovation and dedication to his patients’ results, Dr. Bauman has proven himself transformative because he’s consistently moved the hair restoration field forward into the mainstream, which has in turn helped tens of millions of Americans „reboot” or enhance their appearance, confidence and self-esteem through hair transplantation and the medical specialty of hair restoration.” Dr. Bauman opened Bauman Medical in 1997, at a time when he says, “great technology was coming of age.” Continued technological advances, coupled with Dr. Bauman’s successful adoption and implementation of them, have been at the forefront of his success. He has long been a pioneer of new hair transplant procedures; after performing his first FUE-style hair transplant in 2001, Dr. Bauman was the first surgeon to present a Poster Abstract on FUE at the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery’s Annual Meeting in 2003 and was also the first to perform FUE at the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery’s Orlando Live Surgery Workshop a few months later in 2004. In 2008, he became the first ABHRS-certified hair restoration physician to routinely use NeoGraft FUE for hair transplant procedures. Dr. Bauman attended the launch of the ARTAS robotic hair transplant system in Anchorage, Alaska in 2011, and later his clinic became one of the first full-time ABHRS-certified FUE-only practices to offer robotic-assisted ARTAS FUE transplants in the US. The ARTAS system offers consistent micron-level precision for hair follicle harvesting, protection of existing hair during site-making as well as sophisticated 3D preview imaging for realistic patient expectations. Over the years, he and his team transplanted over two million FUE grafts, making him among one of the most experienced and sought after surgeons performing artistic FUE hair transplant procedures in the world. Today, the Bauman Medical Hair Transplant and Hair loss Treatment Center in Boca Raton, Florida is the world’s largest and most comprehensive stand-alone treatment facility dedicated exclusively to hair restoration for men and women. Dr. Bauman’s distinction as a world-class hair restoration physician is not only due to his continued investment in the latest technology, but also his foresight and ability to leverage those technologies and digital tools to benefit and connect with patients around the world. “Thanks to social media and other digital communications, we’ve seen today’s effective hair loss treatments move to center stage,” explained Dr. Bauman. “Which has been a huge step forward in helping men and women win the battle against hair loss, by connecting them with the help they need, wherever they are.” Dr. Bauman’s commitment to his patients through education, continued training and innovation, are the cornerstone of his success, as well as his partnerships with other industry experts. “Dr. Bauman exemplifies the type of surgeons NeoGraft seeks for a partner,” commented Glenn Normoyle, CEO of NeoGraft. “The industry as a whole has benefited from mirroring his patient first approach to generate consistently excellent outcomes.” Spencer Kobren, best-selling author, host of the syndicated talk radio show, The Bald Truth, and founder of the American Hair Loss Association, echoed this by adding, “Over the last 20 years, Dr. Bauman has distinguished himself as a true innovator in the field of hair restoration. An exemplary IAHRS-accepted member, he has consistently been one of the earliest adopters of the best, most effective technology and treatments and has always been passionate about sharing this valuable information.” Kobren added, “I’m confident he will continue to positively transform the industry as well as the lives of his many patients.” To learn more about Dr. Bauman and Bauman Medical visit http://www.baumanmedical.com or call 1-877-BAUMAN-9 or 561-394-0024.

What it did was to hold in “abeyance” its ruling so that the Trump administration could determine its approach. To that end, the White House could withdraw its support altogether, it could significantly weaken the Obama rule or it could slightly modify the one the Obama administration put forth. “This is obviously important but not terribly surprising. I don’t think the DC Circuit has ever gone ahead and decided on the legality of a rule when a new administration says it plans to rescind or revise it,” says Jeff Holmstead, a partner in the Bracewell law firm in Washington. “If the Court had upheld the rule, it wouldn’t have prevented the new (Trump) Administration from revoking it, but it might have made this effort harder.”  Some background: In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that carbon dioxide is a pollutant that could be regulated under the Clean Air Act—something that EPA made official in 2009, saying it was a danger to public health and welfare. And in 2014, the high court upheld that so-called endangerment finding. That ruling is the foundation behind President Obama’s Clean Power Plan and the one that the Trump administration is honor-bound to enforce. But in February 2016, the Supreme Court issued a “stay” to address some concerns of several states before sending the case back to the DC Court of Appeals, where a decision to either uphold the law or remand it back to Trump’s EPA will come in due time. No matter how it rules, it will head back to the high court, which is now has a ninth Justice in Neil Gorsuch who could be the deciding vote. When it comes to the legal merits of the Clean Power Plan, those who say it is unconstitutional and it should be tossed aside argue that it usurps the rights of states and forces the retirement of at least 49,000 megawatts of coal-fired capacity. But other legal experts say that EPA’s rule gives states several alternative options to comply, such as replacing their coal-fired generation with plants that run on cleaner natural gas, or with green energies. States with a lot of coal, for instance, have less stringent requirements. The appeals court’s “decision doesn’t change the fact that any attempted replacement of the last regulation must articulate how the EPA is meeting its obligations to protect public health under the Clean Air Act, including a public process of notice and comment,” says Jonathan Levy, formerly the Deputy Chief of Staff to Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz under Obama. So what is big business to do? Nearly half of the Fortune 500, for example, is taking steps to track and reduce their carbon emissions. Those companies are also trying to improve energy efficiencies and to increase their consumption of renewable energy, according to the just-released Power Forward 3.0 report. And as the cost of the technologies and the fuels drop, companies are striving to do more and more. So, it would stand to reason that the businesses listed in that report support efforts to bring states into compliance. Practically speaking, their customers are demanding a greener presence and they are meeting that market demand. Some of the companies included are: Bank of America, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, IBM, Proctor & Gamble, General Mills, Kellogg Company and WalMart. “Companies are not waiting for policymakers to catch up with the realities of climate change,” said Anne Kelly, director of public policy at Ceres, a nonprofit sustainability advocacy group. “States with unstable climate and energy policy environments will discourage corporate investments and miss out on jobs and economic growth.” Along with Ceres, the World Wildlife Fund, Calvert Investments and David Gardiner and Associates contributed to the report. It is not accurate to equate the court’s allowance for a delay with its ultimate decision. Some insiders think it implies the case will get sent back to Trump’s EPA so that it can water it down. If that were the case, the appeals court would have given EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt the unlimited time he had requested to review the ruling; the justices gave his agency just 60 days. “At the very least, (the) ruling means that it will not take as long for the (Trump) Administration to undo the Clean Power Plan,” insists Bracewell’s Holmstead. Lots of disagreement there, however: No matter how the courts ultimately decide the Clean Power Plan, a lot of experts think that market pressures will continue to force both utilities and industry to step up and to provide cleaner solutions.

Quotient Signs Definitive Agreement to Acquire Crisp Mobile Combined company expands Quotient’s capabilities in shopper marketing Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail ???pagination.previous??? ???pagination.next??? Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail May 02, 2017 04:05 PM Eastern Daylight Time MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Quotient Technology Inc. (NYSE:QUOT), a leading digital promotions, media and analytics company that connects brands, retailers and shoppers, today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Crisp Media, Inc., which does business as Crisp Mobile. A mobile marketing and advertising company, Crisp has a proven track record of delivering successful shopper marketing campaigns for consumer packaged goods brands (CPGs) and retailers. Crisp’s deep mobile media expertise, coupled with its advanced technology platform, complements Quotient’s existing promotions and media offerings and is expected to position Quotient to better take advantage of what’s predicted to become a nearly $19.0 billion market1 in the next few years. “Crisp is a natural fit for Quotient as we expand our efforts in shopper marketing,” said Mir Aamir, President and Chief Operating Officer of Quotient. “We believe the power of our retail network and proprietary shopper data, combined with Crisp’s ability to create and deliver premium and effective mobile ads for CPG brands, puts us in a strong position as the industry rapidly shifts to digital. Additionally, Crisp expands and strengthens our ability to attribute media campaigns to in-store sales.” Already, Crisp has strong relationships with leading ad agencies and CPGs in the US, working with them to drive in-store sales at specific retailers through interactive mobile advertising. Crisp’s platform seamlessly links data, personalized creative messages and analytics to reach the right shoppers at the right moment on their path to purchase. Shopper marketing, long the realm of end-of-aisle promotions and point-of-purchase signage, has rapidly transformed as shopper marketing teams turn to mobile to reach shoppers with key product offers and messages before they shop, in store, and after they shop. That is exactly what Crisp has become so skilled at doing. “We’re thrilled to join Mir, Steven and the Quotient family,” said Jason Young, CEO of Crisp. “There is tremendous opportunity within shopper marketing to reach millions more shoppers digitally than traditional tactics can provide, and we believe Quotient’s scale, solutions and data will make a great combination with the mobile shopper activation business we’ve built at Crisp over the last several years.” While Crisp will operate as its own brand, Quotient will take advantage of the natural synergies. Young, who comes with 20 years of media experience at Ziff Davis Inc., where he ran the digital media business and eventually served as CEO, will continue to run the team. He will report to Mr. Aamir. Crisp is headquartered in New York City, with field representatives at key locations, including Bentonville, Arkansas; Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas and Atlanta. Crisp is backed by Meritage Funds, Intel Capital and EDB Investments. Acquisition Details The Company will pay approximately $33.0 million in upfront consideration, comprising cash and stock of $20.0 million and $13.0 million respectively (approximately 1.2 million shares valued based on a 90-day volume weighted average trading price) subject to certain adjustments at closing. Additionally, contingent consideration of up to $24.5 million in cash may become payable upon the achievement of certain financial metrics over a period of one year after closing. The deal is expected to close by the end of Q2 2017. Conference Call Information Management will host a conference call and live webcast to further discuss the acquisition during its Q1 2017 earnings call today at 4:30 p.m. EDT/ 1:30 p.m. PDT.

Follow @pinknews News News Home UK US World Trans Politics Education Law Religion Business Entertainment Trans Opinion Travel Life Life Home Health Sport About Advertise Contact Privacy RSS Search Home UK US World Current Affairs Entertainment Opinion Travel Features Trans Current Affairs 240 members of Congress co-sponsor bill to outlaw anti-LGBT discrimination Nick Duffy, PinkNews 2nd May 2017, 5:04 PM Democrats at the previous Equality Act launch 240 members of Congress have put their weight behind a bill to outlaw anti-LGBT discrimination in the United States. There are currently no federal-level protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in the US. This means that it is legal to fire people or deny them services for being gay in more than 30 states due to patchy state-level protections. The Democrats have repeatedly tried to add LGBT rights protections to existing anti-discrimination civil rights laws, but Republicans in Congress have blocked both the Equality Act and its predecessor, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA). The Democrats today staged a high profile relaunch for the Equality Act legislation, though hopes are not high that the legislation will pass given the Republican majorities in both houses. Senator Cory Booker is one of the bill’s sponsors The Human Rights Campaign describes the bill as “bipartisan legislation”, but in the previous session it was backed by just three Republican lawmakers. HRC says the law would “provide clear and equal protections under federal law for all Americans in vital areas of life, like employment, access to public spaces, housing, credit, education, jury service, and federally-funded programs.” Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said: “No person’s fundamental rights should be determined by which side of a state line they live on. “The Equality Act will once and for all end the unacceptable patchwork of non-discrimination laws across this country that leaves LGBTQ people at risk. “Every American should have a fair chance to earn a living, provide for their families, and live their lives without fear of discrimination. And at its core, that’s what the Equality Act is all about.” HRC points to polling that shows the overwhelming majority of Americans still support anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people. Polling released last year by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) found that support for a bill like the Equality Act topped 70 percent nationally, including a majority of Democrats, Republicans and Independents. The survey found majority support for the Equality Act in all 50 states. However, on a state level, opponents of LGBT rights have had some success derailing debates around discrimination protections by using scaremongering tactics around transgender people in bathrooms. A horrific ad in support of Republicans in Texas and North Carolina depicted the rape of a little girl in an attack on LGBT rights protections. LGBT activists will be keen to avoid a similar tactic being employed on a national scale, and will emphasise the broad base of corporate support for the law. 90 of America’s most influential corporations have backed the law, including Unilever, Coca-Cola and Google. They are Abercrombie & Fitch Co.; Accenture; Adobe Systems Inc.; Advanced Micro Devices Inc.; Airbnb Inc.; Alcoa Inc.; Amazon.com Inc.; American Airlines; American Eagle Outfitters; American Express Global Business Travel; Apple Inc.; Arconic; Automatic Data Processing Inc.; Bank of America; Best Buy Co., Inc.; Biogen; Boehringer Ingelheim USA Corp.; Booz Allen Hamilton Inc.; Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc.; Brown-Forman Corp.; CA Technologies Inc.; Caesars Entertainment Corp.; Capital One Financial Corp.; Cardinal Health Inc.; Cargill Inc.; Chevron Corp.; Choice Hotels International Inc.; Cisco Systems Inc.; The Coca-Cola Co.; Corning Inc.; Cox Enterprises; CVS Health Corp.; Darden Restaurants Inc.; Delhaize America Inc.; Diageo North America; The Dow Chemical Co.; Dropbox Inc.; E.

Democrat Hillary Clinton had promised to prioritise passing the Equality Act if elected President. Democrats promised the LGBT anti-discrimination bill would be a “top priority,” suggesting it could be discussed in the House within the first 100 days of a Clinton presidency. 1 reader comment Share on Facebook Share on Twitter More like this One of the only pro-LGBT Republicans is retiring from Congress Theresa May has been asked if she thinks gay sex is a sin President Hillary Clinton celebrates 100 days in office Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley: As a Christian, I know gay sex is not a sin Watch: Republican Congressman cries as he begs God to ‘forgive’ America for gay marriage Joe Kennedy leads opposition to Trump’s anti-LGBT Army Secretary Theresa May will not dump vital LGBT rights protection, reports indicate ‘Death to gays’ pastor jailed for 35 years for child molestation More: Gay LGBT US Republican democrat Republicans Congress Equality Act Democrats Members of Congress Trending Trending Now JK Rowling shuts down Trump fan Will Young: I've sent my d**k pic to so many men I'm amazed it isn't famous White House to have anti-LGBT religious freedom order signed this week Eight arrested for having 'gay party' Trending JK Rowling shuts down Trump fan on anniversary of Voldemort’s defeat Ex-Strictly star Will Young: I’ve sent my d**k pic to so many men I’m amazed it isn’t famous White House set to have anti-LGBT ‘religious freedom’ order signed this week Eight men arrested for having a ‘gay party’ Latest stories Stephen Colbert accused of homophobia over joke aimed at Trump Teen bravely vows to ‘live his truth’ after being rejected by his mother Police in Bangladesh arrest boss of militant group that killed gay activists Federal court rules gay couple can sue Kim Davis for damages White House set to have anti-LGBT ‘religious freedom’ order signed this week John McCain is not happy about Donald Trump’s anti-LGBT Army Secretary nominee © 2017 PinkNews Terms Contact Advertise
Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Skin Lighteners Market Report Analysis and Forecast 2017 – 2025 Global Skin Lighteners Market: Overview Skin lighteners are chemicals that lighten the skin tone by bringing down the concentration of melanin. Also referred to as skin whiteners or skin bleaching agents, skin lighteners are typically used in specific areas of the skin where melanin concentration is abnormally high. Such areas include birth marks and moles. They function by preventing tyrosinases that brings downs melanin production. Skin lighteners come in the form of lotions, cream, powder, or gels and is comprised of retinoid, melanin-inhibiting ingredient, and sunscreen. Based on product type, skin lighteners can be segmented into topical creams, cryosurgery, and laser resurfacing The global skin lighteners market is characterized by stiff competition, wherein the prominent vendors try to outdo each other on the basis of product differentiation, quality, and pricing. The entry barrier to the market, however, is stiff on account of the stronghold of the existing leading players and high cost of research and development. Request a Brochure of the Report @ www.tmrresearch.com/sample/sample?flag=B&rep_id=515 Global Skin Lighteners Market: Trends and Opportunities The global market for skin lighteners is expected to grow at a healthy clip on account of a growing desire among people to have radiant and flawless skin. Their usefulness in tackling skin-related concerns such as scars, pigmentation, discoloration, acne marks, and age spots has been positively impacting their market. Skin lighteners also aid in the treatment of medical conditions such as vitiligo, hyperpigmentation, melasma, and rosacea. This has further stoked their demand. Strong competition among leading vendors in the market has led to frequent unveiling of innovative products. Another noticeable trend in the market is the use of plant extracts such as aloe vera, green tea extracts, marine algae extract, grape seed extract, mulberry extract, flavonoids, etc. in formulating products because of the rising ranks of discerning consumers preferring natural ingredients. Such plant extract-based skin lighteners aid in lowering melanin production and increase collagen production, thereby making the skin healthy and spot-free. Request for TOC of the Report @ www.tmrresearch.com/sample/sample?flag=T&rep_id=515 One factor discouraging the growth in the market is the presence of certain active ingredients, namely skin lighteners and hydroquinone in skin lighteners which can cause harm to the skin. In fact, hydroquinone is already banned in some countries or can be had only if prescribed by a dermatologist. Global Skin Lighteners Market: Regional Outlook North America leads the global skin lighteners market with maximum share and Europe follows next. This is mainly because of the strong spending capacity of the people, awareness about skin whiteners, an advanced healthcare infrastructure, and a proper regulatory framework in place. Asia Pacific is also considered a lucrative market for skin lighteners because of a strong desire among people in the region for a lighter skin tone, increasing disposable income, and a fast developing healthcare infrastructure. India and China are frontrunners in the market in Asia Pacific by dint of their huge population and growing awareness among them about the various skin lighteners in the market. Japan too is a key market in the region because of its improving healthcare infrastructure.
