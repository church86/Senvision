At the Reds' inaugural "Signing Day" news conference inside Great American Ball Park, the 14 athletes -- all of which were from the P&G Cincinnati Urban Youth Academy -- signed their letters of intent to play at the collegiate level. Full Game Coverage "The Urban Uouth Academy represents the heart and soul of what Reds baseball is," said longtime Reds broadcaster George Grande. "The RBI program, as represented here, gives you an idea of where the heart of Reds baseball is. It's in the community." The P&G Cincinnati Urban Youth Academy was the sixth facility to join the MLB's Urban Youth Academy program, back in the fall of 2009, and is a part of the league's Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities (RBI) program. All Major League teams have supported RBI programs, and RBI annually provides 260,000 boys and girls the opportunity to play baseball at the high school level. "It's just taught me a lot ..." Olivia Berger, a member of the academy who will attend Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati, said of the program. "They gave me so much and I felt like I had to provide back. And if it wasn't for them, I would never be here right now signing." Among the speakers at the news conference were Reds general manager Dick Williams and chief operating officer Phil Castellini. Both had high praise for what the athletes had accomplished. "One of these girls might wind up on a World Series college team or an Olympic team," Castellini said. "One of these gentlemen might indeed play in the Major Leagues, and hopefully for the Cincinnati Reds. That story would be amazing. But this story we're telling today is already amazing." The athletes also heard from Reds reliever Michael Lorenzen, one of the team's most active players in the community. He used his time at the podium to offer advice on ways to keep their journey alive as they move on to the next level. "It's going to be hard. It's going to take a lot of dedication," he said. "But my firm belief is you're going to get out of it what you put into it. So the more you put into it, the more dedicated you are, you're going to be all right."  Jeremy Vernon is a reporter for MLB.com based in Cincinnati.

By BenjaminParkin Facing overstuffed silos and forecasts for another huge harvest this year, U.S. farmers are trying to find new uses for their corn and soybeans. Robust demand for processed foods, animal feed and biofuels isn’t keeping up with a record glut of crops in the U.S. and around the world, after several years of bumper harvests and largely benevolent weather. To sell the surplus, farmers and trade groups are wooing new customers, from car makers to toy companies. In recent years, corn and soybeans have been added to the recipes for Ford Motor Co. F, -0.79% seat cushions, IKEA mattresses, Danone SA’s DANOY, -0.53% yogurt cups and Procter & Gamble Co.’s PG, -0.34% Olay moisturizers. Adidas AG’s Reebok brand recently unveiled sneakers made with corn. Lego A/S earlier this year said it was toying with using grain-based materials to mold its famous bricks. Industry groups also are calling for more research into new ways that the crops could replace petroleum as a raw material in industrial and construction applications. “We’re sitting on a pretty good surplus,” says Paul Bertels, vice president of the National Corn Growers Association, which recently called for more research to put corn in more products. “We stepped back and said, ‘We need to find new uses.’ ” Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say U.S. corn and soybean stockpiles swelled to a combined 10.35 billion bushels in the first quarter of 2017, a record. Soybean futures have fallen more than 10% at the Chicago Board of Trade since mid-January. Corn prices are also under pressure. Analysts expect big harvests in South America to increase the global glut, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in March that U.S. farmers also are expecting record acreage of soybeans this year. Getty Images A 3D drawing pen uses PLA, a corn-based plastic material. The PLA gets pushed through the tip of the pen so that it comes out melted and then cools so the user can draw 3D objects with no computer or software. The hunt for alternative uses for grains and oilseeds isn’t new. NatureWorks LLC, the world’s first and largest maker of a bioplastic called PLA, started in 1989 as a Cargill research project. But the multiyear glut, which has pushed many farmers deeper into debt and some out of business, is adding urgency to that work. Argo Genesis Chemical LLC of Illinois recently developed its own highly flexible, soy-made plastics for use in products like road-paving materials, cardboard and diapers adhesives. The company says such compounds can help shield manufacturers from volatile oil prices. “Long term, we see this being the way the plastics industry moves,” says Steve Davies, spokesman for NatureWorks. “There’s tremendous potential to grow.” Ford Several Ford models use seat cushions made from soybeans. For consumers of these new products, the use of corn and soybeans could be a positive. Many consumers are willing to pay a premium for sustainability. Switching to raw materials that can be grown year after year allows companies to tout their “green” credentials, though researchers are divided over the overall environmental impact. Still, these new uses account for only a fraction of the output in an industry geared toward cranking out billions of bushels a year for animal feed, alcohol and food. Some 96% of global agricultural land is used to produce food, feed and pastures, according to trade association European Bioplastics. Crops for bioplastics took up just 0.01% in 2014; rubber and cotton plants along with crops for biofuel made up much of the remainder. “Those fringe uses of corn are so specialized that they’re interesting, but really people are looking for uses that develop 5 billion bushels of demand,” said Tomm Pfitzenmaier, a founding partner at Summit Commodity Brokerage in Des Moines, Iowa. “That’s where the big swing could come.” But boosters see room for rapid growth, and point to ethanol’s trajectory in the U.S. as an example. Less than 1% of U.S. corn was used as ethanol in the 1980-81 crop year, according to the Agriculture Department. In 2015-16, 5.2 billion bushels, or 38%, of the U.S. crop became biofuel. Some food-security groups say redirecting grain and soybeans toward factories takes away land that will be needed to feed a growing global population. Others say the added value from such alternative uses won’t trickle down to the farmers themselves, since they aren’t the ones processing the grains into these higher-priced products. “A lot of these folks are going to continue to be caught in the system where they’re getting a tiny fraction of what the final product brings to the processors,” says Greg Fogel, policy director at the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition. “That’s not going to solve the problems that currently exist with the rural farm economy.” John Motter, an Ohio farmer and chairman of the United Soybean Board, says that for now U.S. farmers need all the buyers they can find. “Farmers are businessmen. We all take a longer view,” he says, proudly pointing out that the seats in his 2013 Ford F-250 pickup truck are made from oilseed foam. That’s the kind of business opportunity farmers want U.S. companies to see in their fields. “Ford isn’t running soy in their seats because they think it’s a neat thing to do,” says Keith Cockerline, director of industrial uses at the United Soybean Board. “It’s because they’re making money at it.” Benjamin Parkin is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in Chicago.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: How Berkshire Hathaway Makes Most of Its Money Here's how Berkshire Hathaway earns its money, and where it generates the most of its profit. Jordan Wathen (TMFValueMagnet) Jun 7, 2017 at 8:40AM From a humble start as a Massachusetts-based textile mill, Warren Buffett built Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) into one of the world's largest conglomerates. The company now owns an empire of brands that spans from the second-largest U.S. railroad to smaller businesses like Benjamin Moore paints. Some businesses are real needle-movers, while others are mere afterthoughts that came along for the ride as part of a larger acquisition. Outside its investment profits, only four broad business lines venture into the double-digits as a percentage of its profits. Understanding Berkshire's income statement Unlike most companies, Berkshire Hathaway has a substantial investment portfolio that holds stakes in publicly traded companies. Due to the way accounting works, its investment profits are mostly a function of timing, as they flow into the income statement when investments are sold at a gain. Berkshire Hathaway's operating businesses generate the majority of its profit in any given year. Image source: Getty Images. Last year was a particularly active year for Berkshire's investment portfolio. The company realized gains in Wrigley, Kraft Heinz, Dow, and Procter & Gamble. Naturally, these gains had an outsize impact on its income statement, but it would be folly to assume that they are repeatable, or that investment gains can be predicted for any given year. For this reason, Berkshire's operating businesses are perhaps more important for understanding how the company makes its money. The four segments below are its most important to its profit and loss in any given year. The grab bag: $5.6 billion Last year the manufacturing, service, and retailing businesses took the top spot from Berkshire's insurance units as the leading generator of non-investment profit. This group includes large businesses and familiar names like Lubrizol, Precision Castparts, Fruit of the Loom, Duracell, NetJets, Pampered Chef, and Dairy Queen. I could go on and on...this segment is truly massive! Collectively, these businesses generated revenue of $120 billion just last year. About 40% of this category's revenue comes from McLane, a distributor that sells goods to grocery stores and the general food service industry, but profit margins are minuscule, making it a considerably smaller source of profit than sales. Precision Castparts, a manufacturer of complex metal components used primarily in airplanes and power industries, is a leading driver of its profits in the category. It was acquired in 2015, setting the record for the largest acquisition in Berkshire's history.  Unfortunately, Berkshire shares very little about the individual companies in this group. In the 2016 annual letter to shareholders, Buffett explained that it only discloses the required minimum, for various reasons: We have far too many companies in this group to comment on them individually. Moreover, their competitors -- both current and potential -- read this report. In a few of our businesses, we might be disadvantaged if outsiders knew our numbers. Therefore, in certain of our operations that are not of a size material to an evaluation of Berkshire, we only disclose what is required. Buffett is more than pleased with this group as a whole, noting that the underlying businesses are rather profitable. The group collectively earned 24% after taxes on their net tangible capital, "despite their holding large quantities of excess cash and carrying very little debt," Buffett wrote in his 2016 letter to shareholders.  The risk business: $5 billion When Buffett took control of Berkshire Hathaway, he immediately began to redirect the cash generated by its textile mills into new industries with better long-term prospects. Insurance rapidly became a core Berkshire Hathaway business, and to this day, it remains a key source of both revenue and profits. Insurance profits are generated in two ways: From underwriting profits (earned when premiums exceed losses and expenses) and investment income (earned by investing the float generated by its insurance businesses). Investment income from a vast stock and bond portfolio generates roughly 73% of its insurers' post-tax income, while underwriting profits make up the other 27%. It is incredibly rare for insurers to be as profitable as Berkshire's, as the industry generally loses money on its underwriting with the hope of making up for underwriting losses with investment gains. GEICO, for example, has been profitable in every year since 2000 on an underwriting basis. In contrast, its largest competitor, State Farm, has consistently generated billion-dollar underwriting losses. I'd argue that Berkshire's insurance companies are the crown jewels of its operating companies given their robust profitability and the fact they generate more than $105 billion of float that Buffett and his portfolio managers can invest as they please. Berkshire's insurance units have industry-leading profitability. Image source: Getty Images. The train set: $3.6 billion Acquired by Berkshire in 2009, BNSF is the second-largest railroad by volume and revenue. It's also a very important driver of profits for Berkshire Hathaway, generating $3.6 billion of profit in 2016, despite a downswing in commodity prices that negatively affected railroad earnings industrywide. Keep in mind that the railroad's profits are somewhat overstated compared to their actual cash profitability. In the last three years, total free cash flow has tallied to $7.6 billion compared to net income of $13.6 billion. Railroads require consistent billion-dollar investments to maintain their rails. Thus, less than 60% of its earnings have come out in the form of cash in the last three years. That's neither good nor bad; it's just the reality of the railroad business, and something to keep in mind when comparing its profits in railroads to its capital-light insurance profits, for example. Berkshire's power plants: $2.3 billion Berkshire Hathaway Energy is a reliable generator of profit, earning $2.3 billion in 2016 primarily from regulated utilities. Buffett likes the utility industry for the simple fact that it allows Berkshire to deploy billions of dollars in capital expenditures and collect an almost royalty-like stream of income from the power they produce over time. Most local power markets allow for the existence of a monopoly to produce and sell power to all consumers and businesses in the area. Profits are therefore almost guaranteed. And when you're as cash-rich as Berkshire is -- the company had more than $96 billion of cash last quarter -- having a reliable place to invest billions of dollars at a reasonable rate of return is a very valuable asset.

Scott Hagedorn predicts Hearts & Science will open in Australia within four months Global CEO Scott Hagedorn told Mumbrella the agency was now fast tracking its expansion into the local market as it sought a foundation client to help with the launch. After starting up in April last year, Hearts & Science has scaled quickly to open 13 offices with 800 employees and more than $5b in spending. The agency launched on the back of wins of the Procter & Gamble and AT&T business in the US and Hagedorn said Australia was a natural opportunity for the agency. “We launched in Japan with P&G and we are actually looking for the right client,” Hagedorn said. “We are looking for the right clients. We have pitched a few times in New Zealand and I’d say we will be here in three to four months.” He said the launch of the agency in the region would replicate what it had done elsewhere and that there was already scoping for staff underway. “We will probably do very similar to how we have set it up in other markets where we have had Annalect’s leadership assume responsibility for it which is how we set it up in the US,” he said. Annalect is Omnicom’s data and analytics business The agency has been built on the twin proposition of “hearts” where it is working to create more reciprocal relationships with clients while developing “science” through the use of sophisticated data platforms. Hagedorn said the move into Australia was being supported by Omnicom Media Group CEO Peter Horgan. Simon Canning Simon is Mumbrella's marketing and advertising editor.

Events Other Industry Events Jobs More About Mumbrella Freelance Directory Business Directory Advertise Subscribe to newsletter News The ad industry has ‘poisoned’ programmatic and it needs fixing fast, Scott Hagedorn warns June 7, 2017 11:23 by Simon Canning 0 Adland has poisoned programmatic, destroying its potential to be a huge force in the future of advertising, thanks to a lack of transparency that has left clients with little trust in the industry, the CEO of Hearts & Science has warned. Programmatic has been poisoned by the ad industry, Scott Hagedorn warned. Delivering the opening keynote at Mumbrella360 today, Scott Hagedorn, global CEO of Hearts & Science – which was founded little more than a year ago and immediately captured headlines winning Procter & Gamble and AT&T – warned that the damage had been so great the industry may not get the chance to repair it. “We as an industry have poisoned programmatic,” Hagedorn said. “We told clients oftentimes that it was about real-time trading and there was all these people with hands on keyboards that were doing bidding and going after inventory when in reality it was more of a set it and forget it. We would go in and program a clients’ KPIs into a DSP and we would focus on the buying side of it and then it became increasingly non-transparent. “We actually poisoned probably the best-part about programmatic.” He said advertising technology was becoming the backbone of the industry and and needed to be trusted – “Yet it has still a really big stigma in the industry.” He called on the industry to refocus on “the core of the apple, which is how you create new digital audience currencies”. “How ultimately are we going to get another bite of the apple of programmatic and think about how we re-frame what it really means,” he said. “How do you liberate data and use it in new ways to activate on it? And then the next layer out is how you write business rules to make the internet and marketing behave the way you want it to behave,” he said. “We forgot probably the most important thing, and this is the most unfortunate effect that programmatic has, was we started to divorce advertising from context. Programmatic cut the context off of media.” He also noted that with a lack of transparency there “were entire communities of buyers that had no idea where their ads were being placed”. Hagedorn also warned that the currencies that were being used by agencies and their clients to measure the effectiveness of their strategies were failing and the way forward needed to be built on the application of new measures that captured how people were actually behaving. Hagedorn said that one of the drivers in setting up Hearts & Science was the desire to reset the discussion and regain the trust of clients. “There is a client knee-jerk reaction right now with everything that’s happening in digital to try and go back to the way it was, let’s go back to television – that is a very dangerous line of thinking,” he said. He also warned that current industry measures are missing massive chunks of digital audiences on mobile, with an urgent rethink of metrics needed. As part of its business model Hearts & Science partnered with Newstar and Integral Ad Science to offer its clients new audience currencies that better reflected the real world. The agency’s own research, he said, had found a disturbing gap in what was being measured – what he has dubbed “The Unreachables”. “What we have found is that 40% of all the impressions right now are not measured by syndicated research sources.” As part of the study the agency is undertaking into The Unreachables, Hearts & Science is considering digital efficacy and the need to consider the environment in which ads were appearing. The gap was discovered by an agency strategist who highlighted that all the syndicated research failed to capture the media behaviour of her and her friends at all. “So 40%-50% of the time we think the data on how people are actually consuming content does not live in the syndicated data sets that we give our teams to use to plan,” Hagedorn said. “Why that’s dangerous is those syndicated data sets will lead you right back into television again because they can’t accurately right now measure mobile.” He said currently agencies had to use gut feel to re-calibrate mobile recommendations for clients because the data did not exist as they tried to capture The Unreachables.   “At a broader level right now what I’m considering is ‘What’s the real effect of digital? Do we need different types of metrics? Do we need to look at it maybe a little bit differently?’ “Some of the platforms – I don’t want to blast all of the platforms – but some of the areas we need to consider what role it really plays in the overall purchase cycle. “Please don’t coin negative brand equity as something that I said, but I worry in some instances on digital platforms that that could actually be true.” With brand safety now paramount in the minds of advertisers he said that clients needed to consider where they wanted their brands to reside, not agencies, saying it was like putting a sign in someone’s front yard, but ignoring what might be happening in the house. “You can’t put that sign in their yard saying buy your products if you’re not comfortable with what happens inside their house,” he said.

Owens-Illinois is the highest ranked company in metropolitan Toledo in this year’s edition of the Fortune 500. Company revenues grew 9 percent last year, and O-I comes in at No. 401 on the list. THE BLADE Buy This Image Maumee-based Dana Inc. is listed at No. 447 in the Fortune 500 list. THE BLADE Buy This Image Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print Owens-Illinois Inc., which saw net revenues jump 9 percent last year, is the highest ranked company in metropolitan Toledo in this year’s edition of the Fortune 500. In all, northwest Ohio had four companies on the list, plus three more on the Fortune 1,000 list, based on annual revenues. The list, in its 63rd year and released Wednesday by Fortune magazine, is widely seen as one of the benchmarks for top-tier corporate success. “There definitely is a prestige, a credibility and a reputation that comes with being on that list,” said Wendy Gramza, president at the Toledo Regional Chamber of Commerce. Having those companies in your city also boosts the region’s credibility and reputation, she said. “Having Fortune 500 companies and specifically world headquarters in our region is extremely important,” she said. “It puts us on the global stage. It helps us to diversify our economy. We love our manufacturing jobs, but we also love the white-collar jobs that can bring in recent college grads and can bring our millennials back home.” O-I, a Perrysburg firm which makes bottles and other glass containers, moved up 17 spots on this year’s list to No. 401. Its revenues were $6.7 billion in 2016. Two other metro Toledo firms also made the 2017 Fortune 500 list. Dana Inc., with revenues of $5.8 billion, came in at No. 447, and Owens Corning, with revenues of $5.7 billion, was No. 458. Dana is based in Maumee. Owens Corning is based in downtown Toledo. Compared to the 2016 list, Dana slipped 19 spots and OC moved up 22 spots. Looking more broadly across the region, Marathon Petroleum Corp. slipped nine spots, but the Findlay oil refining and marketing firm retained the top spot in northwest Ohio at No. 51. The rankings are based on 2016 revenue calculations from Fortune, though the figures don’t always match what the companies report in their annual reports. For example, Marathon reported 2016 revenues of $63.4 billion, though Fortune pegged its revenue at $55.9 billion. In years past, Marathon officials have said the difference appeared to be because of how Fortune treats excise taxes. Marathon was Ohio’s fourth largest company by revenue. The top spot in the state went to Dublin-based Cardinal Health, whose $121.5 billion in revenue put it at No. 15 overall. Kroger (at No. 18 overall) and Procter & Gamble (No. 36 overall) rounded out Ohio’s top three. Michigan’s top ranked firms were General Motors at No. 8, Ford at No. 10, and Dow Chemical, at No. 62. Nationally, Wal-Mart held onto the top spot, with revenues of nearly $486 billion. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway was No. 2, with revenues of $224 billion. Apple Inc. rounded out the top three with revenues of $216 billion. Forbes said 20 newcomers are on this year’s list, including electric carmaker Tesla, which came in at No. 383 with revenues of $7 billion. The Toledo region had another three companies in the larger Fortune 1000 — Welltower Inc. at No. 564 with revenues of $4.3 billion, The Andersons Inc. at No. 595 with revenues of $3.9 billion, and Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. at 743 with revenues of $2.9 billion. Welltower made the biggest move of any Toledo-area company, gaining 45 spots. Contact Tyrel Linkhorn at tlinkhorn@theblade.com or 419-724-6134.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 7 June 2017 by Abhishek Budholiya Benzoyl Alcohol Market Explores New Growth Opportunities By 2017 – 2027 Benzoyl alcohol is an aromatic type of alcohol with colourless and pleasant odour characteristics. The benzoyl alcohol has low toxicity, low vapour pressure and polar properties owing to which it is highly used as a solvent in the industrial applications. For instance, in the paints and coatings industry benzoyl alcohol acts as a general solvent and also as a viscosity reducing agent for lacquers, paints, coatings, inks etc. In cosmetic industry, benzoyl alcohol is a precursor for the manufacture of esters used in perfume, soap and flavour industries. Naturally, benzoyl alcohol is found in the essential oils such as jasmine, styrax, almonds, etc. Benzoyl alcohol also acts as an antiseptic and preservative agent in healthcare applications. For instance, in the preservation of ointment and as anaesthesia, benzyl alcohol is used. Other applications include, benzoyl alcohol as a desiccant for plastic films and fibres, as a stabiliser for PVC products, photographic developer etc. The global benzoyl alcohol market is expected to grow at moderate CAGR, as benzoyl alcohol is one of the starting material for other chemical manufacture. For instance, in the manufacture of polypeptides, esters benzoyl alcohol is widely used as a starting or intermediate material. Global Benzoyl Alcohol Market: Drivers and Restraints Benzoyl alcohol is a versatile solvent used in wide range of applications. For instance, in paint industry benzoyl alcohol is an important substitute for methylene chloride. The eco-friendly nature is one of the prime factor driving the global benzoyl alcohol market. The growth in the end-use industries such as pharmaceutical, food and personal care which requires benzoyl alcohol as a solvent and co-solvent further drives the global benzoyl alcohol market. The increasing demand for perfumes and fragrances propels the global benzoyl alcohol market. For instance, benzoyl alcohol is high in demand for benzyl acetate preparation which is used as jasmine perfume ingredient. Request For Report Sample: http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-3944 However, the fluctuations in the raw material prices, macro-economic factors impacts the growth of global benzoyl alcohol market. Global Benzoyl Alcohol Market:  Segmentation Benzoyl Alcohol Market Segmentation By Basis Type – Natural, Synthetic; By Application – Flavours & Fragrances, Coatings, Agrochemicals; By End Use – Pharmaceutical, Cosmetic, Personal Care, Paints & Coatings, Lubrication, Chemical, Others Global Benzoyl Alcohol Market:  Region wise Outlook The global benzoyl alcohol market is divided into seven regions, namely North America, Latin America, Asia Pacific excluding Japan (APEJ), Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Japan and the Middle East and Africa (MEA). The benzoyl alcohol market in North America is driven by the pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturing companies. The presence of prominent cosmetic and personal care companies such as Procter & Gamble Company, Johnson & Johnson, etc. in the U.S are the major ones for benzoyl alcohol consumption.

Published on June 07, 2017. From left to right: Jeremy Rainbird, Kira Carstensen, Sharon Horgan, Clelia Mountford, Siobhan Murphy and Dan Dickenson Credit: Merman Most Popular Production company Merman, co-founded by Sharon Horgan, the co-creator and star of comedy series "Catastrophe," and Sarah Jessica Parker's "Divorce" on HBO, and her producer partner Clelia Mountford, has opened a branded entertainment division. Merman has also opened offices in Los Angeles, London and New York. The division is led by Kira Carstensen, U.S,-based global managing partner and former Pulse executive, along with production and advertising veteran Jeremy Rainbird. The new unit will work with Merman's narrative film and television division, which is run by Mountford. The company's directing talent includes Lucy Walker, Mariana Youssef, MJ Delaney and Peter Lydon. In the U.K., Merman is led by Executive Producer and Partner Dan Dickenson, formerly of Partizan, and Business Development Director Siobhan Murphy, who moved over from Moxie. Horgan said in a statement: "It's not a romantic thing, like I watched 'Mad Men' and thought I wanted to be them. It's more about the people I've met in advertising, the directors and creatives, and the work they do. That you have 30 seconds worth of time to create something, and that something could make you laugh, was a surprise to me. We are also in an environment where there is a lot of crossover in making content." James Britton Credit: Stink Studios Stink has promoted James Britton, managing director of Stink Studios Europe, to global managing director and CEO Mark Pytlik has resigned to pursue other opportunities. Reporting to Stink Group Global CEO James Morris, Britton will work closely with the current leadership across Stink Studios. He joined Stink Studios, then Stinkdigital, six years ago from AKQA, where he helped develop the Nike Football business and became managing director in 2014. Pytlik, who will remain a company shareholder and board advisor, said: "I'm very proud of what we've achieved in my ten years at Stink, but now it's time for me to try something different. I wish James Britton all the best and have no doubt that he'll do a fantastic job in the new role." Geremy Jasper and Georgie Greville Credit: Prettybird Prettybird has signed writing and directing duo Geremy Jasper and Georgie Greville for global representation for branded entertainment and music videos. The longtime filmmaking team, known largely for their music videos, film and commercial work, will be rostered as separate directors. They co- founded Legs, the multimedia studio behind projects such as Target's Gold Cannes Lion winner "Kaleidoscopic Fashion Spectacular." Jasper's first feature film, "Patti Cake$", appeared at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival and will be released theatrically by Fox Searchlight this summer. Saul Dibb Credit: Hungry Man Hungry Man has added director Saul Dibb to its roster. He is known for writing and directing for both cinema and TV films such as "Bullet Boy" (2004), "The Line of Beauty" (2006), "The Duchess" (2008), "Suite Française" (2014) and "NW" (2016) and is currently awaiting the release of his most recent feature, "Journey's End" (2017). His commercial work includes projects for the U.K.'s Home Office and Morrisons. Samir Mallal Credit: Independent Films Independent Films has added director Samir Mallal to its roster for exclusive representation in the U.K. and Amsterdam. Mallal first found prominence with his film "Artic Sun" for Tropicana, which earned him a spot on the Saatchi & Saatchi New Directors Showcase at the Cannes Lions festival, and won him Saatchi's 2010 Best Young Director award, as well as a Gold Lion. He has since directed commercials for Google, GE, Starbucks and Coca-Cola. Kevin Bray Credit: Hound Content Los Angeles content studio Hound has signed director Kevin Bray for U.S. representation. He has directed music videos for artists including Jennifer Lopez, Whitney Houston, Christina Aguilera, Gloria Estefan and Celine Dion, and has helmed spots for brands such as Nike, Puma, Verizon, Macy's, USA Network and the Florida Lottery. He has also directed for TV shows such as "Suits," "The Killing" and "Heroes." Production company 1stAveMachine is linking with VR community and platform Kaleidoscope to form a new partnership focused on branded VR content. 1stAveMachine's roster of directors will team up with Kaleidoscope's 150 artists and directors to craft VR-centric films, art, games and other experiences. Ezra Xenos Credit: Halal Amsterdam production company Halal has recruited Ezra Xenos, former head of production at Anomaly and Sid Lee, as executive producer. Xenos has worked on campaigns for the likes of Nike, Adidas, Absolut Vodka, and ESPN. His appointment follows that of Christel Hofstee as head of production earlier this year. Poo Sukumalanand Credit: We Fly Coach Production company We Fly Coach has appointed Poo Sukumalanand as its first executive producer out of its Bangkok office. Sukumalanand joins We Fly Coach following a long stint at Big Blue Productions. She has over 15 years of experience in the advertising space, spanning production, marketing and sales roles working with brands including Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Sony, Booking.com, Coca-Cola, Toyota, Marriott, Mitsubishi, Canon, Ford and KLM. Graham Chisholm Credit: Arcade Arcade has added creative editor Graham Chisholm to its team. Chisholm began his career in Montreal, Canada before moving to Toronto and has worked on projects for brands including Gatorade, Land Rover, Budweiser, Ford, Chevrolet and The Toronto Raptors.

Request to view Table of Content @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/botanical-supplements-market/toc Interest in healthy eating is influencing consumers to shift their dietary preferences in favour of food and food ingredients with potential health benefits. For consumers looking for a healthy lifestyle and seeking to reduce the risk of illness, herbal and botanical supplements (popularly known as herbal medicinal products) are among the best options. Botanical supplements include fresh or dried products in different forms, such as tablets, capsules, powders, and tea bags. Globally, garlic, ginger, santalum, plantago, ginseng, rhodiola extract, red clover extract, and soy extract are some of the most widely used botanical supplements. Increasing elderly population and little or no side effects of botanical supplements are expected to drive the global botanical supplements market. According to the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN-DESA), there were 841 million people aged 60 and above in 2013 compared to 205 million in 1950. The number is projected to reach over 2 billion by 2050. In the last few years, Europe has emerged as the largest market for botanical supplements, followed by Asia Pacific. In Asia Pacific, the long-standing tradition of using botanical medicine, the current economic development, and increasing urbanization are some factors driving the increasing demand for botanical supplements. Owing to these factors, Asia Pacific is expected to surpass Europe as the leading market for botanical supplements. The botanical supplements market is bifurcated into application (food and beverages, pharmaceutical, and personal care) and end user (adult women, adult men, baby boomers, and others). The global market for botanical supplements in value term grew from USD 45.1 billion in 2010 to USD 54.6 billion in 2013, and is expected to grow to USD 90.2 billion in 2020 growing at a CAGR of 7.5%. Also, Usage of botanical supplements by adult women (largest end user in 2013) is projected to increase to USD 32.9 billion in 2020 at a CAGR of 7.5%. Sample of this report is available upon request @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/2797 The botanical supplements market is fragmented with several players operating at global or regional levels. The global botanical supplements market is highly fragmented, with top eight companies holding only 38.4% market share. Ricola leads the market with 6.4% global share in 2013, followed by Dabur with 5.5% market share. Ricola and Procter & Gamble are some of the major companies with global operations. Dabur operates mostly in India; however, the company started selling its products in the North American and European countries, such as the U.S., France, Germany and the U.K., recently.

New submitter mirandakatz writes: Steve Ballmer has worn many hats -- as the CEO of Microsoft and the owner of the LA Clippers, to start -- and his latest endeavor, launched earlier this year, is a comprehensive trove of government statistics called USA Facts. Ballmer recently sat down with Backchannel's Steven Levy to discuss publishing government information, owning the Clippers, why he bought stock in Twitter, and what tech can learn from the world of professional sports: "There's no hiding in sports. How well you're doing is all entirely transparent, and there's no way to talk yourself out of a jam, or confuse yourself. It's hardcore -- you either win or you lose. Your season's over, or it's not over. It's just binary. It's the highest accountability thing in the world. In basketball, every human on the planet can evaluate your performance. All the analytics are available. Everybody can watch all your games or write about it -- the columnist knows absolutely everything that the general manager knows. Everything. Your individual human performance can get reviewed in a way that never happens in business. And every 24 seconds, I can tell you how good our teamwork is. That's high accountability." In response to a question asking if a tech company should publish everyone's salary and be transparent to the press, Ballmer replied: "I only worked at one tech company, but I would say, the opportunity to improve accountability in the tech industry is not insubstantial. It's different than Procter & Gamble, which got to show good soap sales every quarter. Some companies making money right now say they're investing for the future. Where's the accountability? You can say, 'Well, the ultimate accountability's the stock price.' It sort of is, but it sort of isn't. You can talk your stock price up. But you can't talk up wins and losses." business microsoft technology ← You may like to read: → Malware Uses Router LEDs To Steal Data From Secure Networks Silicon Valley Investors Call For California To Secede From the US After Trump Win Twitters Says It Will Ban Trump If He Breaks Hate-Speech Rules Twitter Suspends American Far-Right Activists' Accounts Former Engineer Says Uber Is a Nightmare of Sexism; CEO Orders Urgent Investigation When Their Shifts End, Uber Drivers Set Up Camp in Parking Lots Across the US Submission: Steve Ballmer Says Tech Firms Should Be as Accountable as NBA Teams Hyperloop One Reveals Its Plans For Connecting Europe Steve Ballmer Says Tech Firms Should Be As Accountable As NBA Teams More | Reply Login Steve Ballmer Says Tech Firms Should Be As Accountable As NBA Teams Post Load All Comments  Full  Abbreviated  Hidden /Sea Score: 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 More | Reply Login   Nickname: Password: Public Terminal Forgot your password?

That's something along the lines of how a company is doing in market share. How the NBA team is doing as a BUSINESS is quite different. And that's equivalent to how a tech company is doing overall.

He wants things to be as clear as "wins and losses", but that's not how the world operates. When you have a well defined game with contrived endpoints and rules that are agreed upon, it's easy to find clarity. One team wins because we all agreed to an arbitrary set of rules that say the game ends after a set period of time, and whoever has the most points wins. So with a tech company, when does the game end? What constitutes "winning"? Obviously, if you're stupid, you might say, "Whoever has the most net profit at the end of the year wins!" But that doesn't deal with the question of which company achieved more growth, or which company is better positioned for future years. It might be that a company didn't make much money this year, but they work they did this year will get them more money 5 or 10 years from now. That's not like a game. In basketball, you can't say, "I didn't win this game, but the play I pulled off this game will get me 100 points next game!" He points out that, in basketball, either you make the playoffs or you don't. You won or you didn't. Achievement is binary. In tech, and in the rest of life, that's not the case at all. It's not win or lose. Honestly, coming in second is often basically as good as coming in first. Or really, more to the point, most of us will come in 300th, which is about as good as coming in 299th. Plus, a lot of people start businesses and run businesses because they like what they do, and achieving high metrics just isn't the chief concern. It's kind of disturbing to me, when he says: In business, you can say, “Well, I didn’t get it right, but we’re gonna keep working. Okay, we’ll improve that.” In tech, employees like to yak: “My review score—what is it? How much is this? How much is that? Did I do a good job? Let me talk to you.” So he's complaining that, in business, you might not get things right, and then continue to work on it? He's complaining that people want to know if they did a good job? And if your employees were focusing on their review score, maybe you should consider that it's because you, as the head of the company, instituted review scores. If you set up a system of metrics and then base employee success on meeting those metrics, you shouldn't be surprised or put off when those employees want to know how well they're meeting those metrics. Finally, the whole way of talking about it shows that he doesn't understand the nature of professional basketball either. Owning a basketball team is also a business. He talks as though his success as an owner can be determined easily with the binary metric of a win or a loss, but sports teams have a lot more to contend with than that. What about ticket sales? Merchandise sales? Brand association, licensing, fan satisfaction? What about maintaining good relationships within the league? Getting good players and coaches so you can build a better team for future years? I mean, is he really so dumb that he's measuring his success as an owner based on whether his team won the last game, or whether his team makes it to the playoffs? Really, people should not listen to this man.
