Although Facebook continues to grow users, revenue, and profit, there may be headwinds up ahead. Jamal Carnette (TMFJCar) Aug 14, 2016 at 11:36AM Facebook shares have increased more than 200% since its 2012 IPO. Image Source: Facebook. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has been on a tremendous run. Shares of the company are up 33% over the last year versus 6% for the greater Nasdaq-100 index. It's not as if Facebook's run is undeserved; the company has continued to grow revenue, users, and profit at rates higher than Wall Street expectations. As a result, analysts have a one-year target price for Facebook at $154, approximately 24% above its current price. While price targets are often wrong, there are industry-wide tailwinds that bolster the bullish case. Advertising spending continues to shift from television to digital outlets. In particular, mobile spending has exploded and will continue to do so according to eMarketer. And with 1.57 billion mobile monthly active users, or MAUs, Facebook is the largest beneficiary of mobile ad spending. More recently, however, there's been a few threats to the company's business model. When viewed individually, it's easy to dismiss these concerns as inconsequential. When viewed together, however, it points to a company that may have more risks than Wall Street currently realizes. Procter and Gamble finds Facebook's hyped targeting prowess may be overstated In the marketing realm, there's no company more influential than Procter & Gamble. The multinational consumer-goods conglomerate boasts 22 individual brands that gross over $1 billion in sales annually. Many of which are in the fast-moving consumer goods, or FMCG, market characterized by frequent purchases and intense competition. In the FMCG industry branding and marketing matter a great deal, so it's no surprise P&G is the biggest advertising spender in the entire world with a significant portion of that going to Facebook. Facebook has been so successful in digital marketing because of the vast amount of data it has on each user. Presumably, this data can be used for targeted ads, which are generally more effective. However, The Wall Street Journal (subscription required) reported P&G announced this month it would stop its practice of targeting, finding the process has "limited effectiveness." Whether or not targeting effectiveness is the issue -- or if P&G's advertising strategy is lacking -- is of little consequence, as marketing is one of those fields where it's hard to gauge effectiveness and perception is reality. But it has been these targeted ads that have allowed Facebook to charge above-average rates for ads and kept ad-load low while expanding revenue. A shift away from targeted ads to broad, cheaper ads could present headwinds to top-line growth. An ad-blocking arms race Additionally, Facebook is locked in a cat-and-mouse game with ad-blocking software. This month the company announced it would incorporate ad-blocking-blocking technology on its desktop site. Essentially, the company would make it harder for plug-ins like AdblockPlus to filter out its ads. Within a few days the open-source community had found a workaround, or an ad-blocking-blocker-blocker, which allows you to browse the site without ads even after Facebook's update. It's important to note this alone is not a major concern. My thoughts are Facebook and the ad-blocking community will continue to play this whack-a-mole game to the point the average user will no longer care. Additionally, ad-blocking technology does not work on Facebook's mobile app, which is how the vast majority of its MAUs access the site. What this signifies is the growing resistance of users to advertising, which could affect Facebook in the event it has to increase ad load to make up for falling ad rates if there is a shift from targeted ads. Growing apprehension from content providers The last risk is important. First, it's important to note that while Facebook is the largest outlet by mobile ad-spend, it doesn't really create its own content. Instead, it uses the content from unpaid contributors (aka users) and attaches advertising. This description is not to dismiss its business model, but to describe the risk of disputes with its user base. Image Source: Facebook Until recently, the digital publishing community, a major source of content, had looked at the relationship with Facebook as a win-win. A simple look at the fact both entities are competing for the same advertising dollars, essentially eating from the same trough, would have told you this was fiction. Publishers appeared to have gotten the memo. A few changes Facebook has instituted -- limited advertising in exchange for inclusion on the company's Instant Article feature, then changing rules to the detriment of publishers' native-advertising businesses, and Facebook limiting publishers' reach -- have given publishers reason to pause. Television, at this point, is very apprehensive about negotiating with Facebook on displaying their video content. The Wall Street Journal (subscription required) notes the NFL, Walt Disney Company, and Comcast's NBCUniversal are not looking to deal with Facebook as the dual concerns over ceding control of content (see paragraph above) and a shift to digital ad spend may present more risks than the incremental revenue they'd receive. These issues show how important the company has become It's important to restate none of these situations are incredibly important to the company's stock performance on their own. When taken together, however, it shows a company that has transitioned from prey to predator. But as the company continues to transition from just another marketing outlet to the most important force in marketing, concerns like these will most likely increase in both scope and severity. It would behoove investors, myself included, to note these new risks to Facebook's business model. Jamal Carnette owns shares of Facebook.

(Getty) Allyson Felix clocked 49.67 seconds, the fastest time in Sunday’s 400-meter semifinals, to win the heat and advance to Monday’s final. The 30-year-old U.S. sprinter, who is the 2015 400-meter world champion, is running the individual 400-meter for the first time at the Rio Olympics. “I’m just a competitor. I love to win. I love a challenge,” Felix told Yahoo Sports. “I have had success before but I think your goals just kind of shift. For me, that’s really what this year is about. I’m excited to get outside of my comfort zone to take on this new event in the 400 and see where it takes me.” As Felix aims for another gold medal, here’s everything you need to know about her growing wealth. 1. She Has a Net Worth Estimated at $8.5 Million Allyson Felix celebrates after winning the women’s 200-meter dash final at the U.S. Olympic track and field trials in 2012. (Getty) Felix is one of the most accomplished sprinters in U.S. track and field history. Her success has led to lucrative endorsements, and appearances. Felix currently has a net worth estimated at $8.5 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. If she captures gold Monday night, that figure will likely increase with more sponsorship deals.

She Turned Pro After High School & Signed With Adidas As a senior, Felix broke Marion Jones’ national high-school record in the 200-meter. She went on to qualify for the world championships at the U.S. Nationals meet– held just a day after her graduation. Days before beginning her college career at University of Southern California, Felix forfeited her scholarship and NCAA eligibility by turning pro. At the time, she signed a reported six-year, $1-million-plus contract with Adidas in 2004. Adidas would later pick up the cost of her college tuition. Felix graduated from USC with a degree in elementary education in 2008. 3. She Signed an Endorsement Deal With Nike in 2010 Allyson Felix tests out Nike’s new new basketball and training technology at Basketball City, Pier 36 in 2012. (Getty) After six years with Adidas, Felix signed with their top competitor. In 2010, Felix entered into an agreement with Nike, which helped fund her training for the London Games. She has been a part of their 2011 ‘Make Yourself Proud’ campaign and endorsed the Nike “Free” shoe system. The three-time Olympian also fronted Nike’s Spring/Summer Women’s Lookbook in 2013. Felix was featured in their ‘Find Your Fast’ campaign last July to “inspire athletes to run or train for their fastest time.” Felix has additional sponsorships from Acuvue, Procter & Gamble, AT&T and Gatorade.

She Has Earned $130,000 From Olympic Medals Allyson Felix has won four Olympic gold medals. (Getty) Felix will race a talented field in the 400 meters on on Monday night in Rio as she aims for her second individual gold medal and fifth gold medal overall. She also has won two silver medals. American athletes winning medals at the Olympic games receive a cash prize from the U.S. Olympic Committee. The awards vary based on the medal won. Those awards are on top of the actual value of a “gold” medal – which is around $366 for the Rio games. The gold medal is a mixture of a small amount of 24-karat gold, some copper and a lot of sterling silver, according to Time. With four gold and two silver, Felix has earned $130,000 in cash payouts. That total is based on $25,000 for each of the four Olympic gold medals Felix has won, plus $15,000 for each of her two silvers. Felix, who is arguably one of the most impressive athletes of the decade, has won more world championship gold medals than any other U.S. track and field athlete. In addition to her Olympic medals, she holds 19 medals from international competition. Aside from a high medal count, the California native was recognized as one of Glamour’s Women of The Year in 2012. She was also awarded the 2012 Female Athlete of the Year from the IAAF where she posed alongside Usain Bolt and Prince Albert of Monaco at the prestigious ceremony. Felix serves as a member of Barack Obama’s Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition alongside fellow athletes including Saints quarterback Drew Brees, and figure skating legend Michelle Kwan. “The Council will play an important role in our effort to help combat childhood obesity in this country, and I am grateful to the athletes, chefs, doctors and nutrition experts who are volunteering their time on the Council to help make a difference,” First Lady Michelle Obama said following the council appointment in 2010.

Her Brother Is Her Agent How @allysonfelix's brother Wes helped her win Olympic gold. http://t.co/Rez0pT5NCo pic.twitter.com/pkV9hKjZqq — The Players' Tribune (@PlayersTribune) September 24, 2015 In an article Felix wrote for The Players’ Tribune last fall, she opened up about her biggest inspiration: her older brother Wes. Felix revealed she was always in awe of his athletic ability, and was inspired to follow in his footsteps. Like his sister, he grew up in pursuit of an athletic career in track and field. In 2002, Wes was the USA Junior Champion in the 200-meter in 2002 and the Pac 10 champion in the 200-meter in both 2003 and 2004 while running for USC. Felix wrote that her brother has offered unwavering support throughout her career. After Felix’s crushing second-place finishes at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics, Wes was there to encourage her. Not long after the Beijing Games, however, he was diagnosed with a liver virus which immediately ended his own athletic career. Wes turned his attention to another aspect of the sport: serving as his sister’s agent. Since then, he’s helped her gain several new sponsorship deals, and has been her mentor. “My recovery from the injury in 2013 and redemption at the 2015 World Championships would not be possible without the encouragement and advice he’s provided over the years,” Felix wrote. “As I build on this success, I do it with the utmost confidence that one of the essential constants in my life -my brother — is here to help me along the way. Thank you, Wes.” Allyson Felix’s Family: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know U.S. sprinter Allyson Felix aims for her fifth gold medal tonight in the individual 400-meter.

He also noted that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's lead in the polls over her GOP counterpart, Donald Trump, may be a contributing factor to the recent rally. "Not to make a statement on which candidate is better, but usually markets prefer for the incumbent party to retain the White House." The three indexes also posted new intraday highs, as benchmark S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite broke above previous intraday highs of 2,188.45 and 5,238.54, respectively, shortly after the open.  The Dow Jones industrial average also posted a record high, rising past its previous high of 18,638.34. These previous records were all set last week, despite the indexes posting just slight weekly gains. "It's a major vacation time between now and Labor day," said Ernie Cecilia, CIO at Bryn Mawr Trust. "The market right now is floating up on not a lot of news." "There's a lack of alternatives into other instruments," he said, noting that trading volume has been low recently. The S&P gained 0.28 percent, with materials leading. Twenty-nine S&P components hit new 52-week highs, including Sysco — which reported quarterly results before the bell, Ross Stores and Procter & Gamble. "The market is being driven by the same theme," said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird, referring to low interest rates around the world and the "hunt for yield." "Until we get some optimism, the path of least resistance is higher. Nobody likes this market." The Dow rose 59 points, with Boeing and Goldman Sachs contributing the most gains. The Nasdaq added 0.56 percent. "The market should continue to go higher on the no-alternative factor," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. "The market is feeding on itself." "In order to get a big move down, ... you need to see some news the market perceives as bad," said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. "We don't have that right now." Despite posting several milestones last week, stocks traded in a relatively narrow range. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded near multi-year lows last week. On Monday, it traded about 1.5 percent higher, around 11.75. Investors, meanwhile, were watching oil prices as U.S. crude settled 2.81 percent higher at $45.74 a barrel in choppy trade. On Monday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak bolstered hopes that oil producing nations could take action to stabilize prices, telling a Saudi newspaper that his country was consulting with Saudi Arabia and other producers to achieve market stability. "Good luck with that, if investors believe this. The move which we are seeing in the market is the real example how speculations can drive the price action. If you look at the demand equation, we had GDP data from the third biggest economy in the world and it is not something which is praising the demand for oil," said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets. On the data front, the Empire State Manufacturing survey index fell five points to -4.2. "The lack of even a whiff of volatility, however, prevents me from shifting my outlook from neutral to something more far more negative. The intraday range for the blue chip index has consistently fallen to 0.25-0.50% of the underlying index level. When this statistic falls into this tight band, the blue chips have secured a positive daily return 67.7% of the time since October 2001 compared to 54.5% for all sessions over the same period," Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities, said in a Monday note to clients. Other data released Monday included the NAHB housing index, which showed homebuilder sentiment rose 2 points. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) rose about 1 percent, led higher by Toll Brothers, which was up about 3 percent. Investors will also await for the Fed to release the minutes from its July meeting, although Schwab's Frederick said that he doesn't expect any big surprises from them. On the earnings front, several firms, including Home Depot, Lowe's and Cisco Systems, are scheduled to report results this week. "Through Friday's close, 459 companies, or 92%, of S&P 500 have reported 2Q 2016 results," said Nick Raich, CEO at The Earnings Scout, in a Monday note. "While 71% of those companies are exceeding their 2Q 2016 EPS estimates, 60% have had their 3Q 2016 EPS estimate go lower, on average by -1.79%, after releasing results." Last week, retail giant Macy's posted better-than-expected results. U.S. Treasurys fell on Monday, with the two-year note yield holding near 0.72 percent and the benchmark 10-year yields trading at 1.55 percent. The dollar traded lower against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.119 and the yen around 101.2. The pound also hit a one-month low against the greenback. Overseas, European stocks traded mostly flat. Asian equities traded mixed, as Japan's Nikkei 225 fell after its GDP data disappointed, while China's Shanghai composite rose more than 2 percent on stimulus hopes. About two stocks advanced for every decliner at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 422 million and a composite volume of 2.096 billion. Gold futures for December delivery settled $4.30 to $1,347.50 per ounce.

But then after that it’s just kind of like go, go, go again,” said Simone Biles, who won Team USA’s first-ever Olympic vault gold medal on Sunday in Rio. Simone Biles Reveals Her Celebrity Crush, Favorite Food Take Olympic Trivia Quiz to See How Much You Know About the Games Her fellow team member Madison Kocian took the silver medal in the uneven bars event, while teammate Gabby Douglas placed 7th. Kocian, Douglas, Biles and teammates Aly Raisman and Laurie Hernandez sat down with ABC News' Amy Robach in Rio, where they discussed the pressure to excel. “We all have nerves, but at this point it’s kind of autopilot,” Biles said. “We’ve done these routines so many times that once we go out there ... it’s just one more.” Hernandez agreed. “We’re just going to go to training, do what we’ve been doing, not change a thing because that’s working really well,” she said. The “Final Five” have already won gold in the team all-around event, and Biles took a separate gold in the individual all-around competition. “We were very confident once we went out there,” Biles said of her team’s win. “If we had done the same thing in training then we were very confident of the outcome.” The team members had an emotional reunion with their parents at the P&G Family Home -- where Olympic families come to relax and watch the games, have a meal, drop off their laundry and even get pampered with free salon services for women and hot shaves for men. It was the women's first chance to show off their new hardware, hug their families and regroup. The gymnasts say it’s their incredible sisterhood that keeps them laughing as they enter the home stretch of the games. “We’ve been together so long,” Kocian said. Their time together – and their bond – helps their performance. “We’re just so ready that’s it’s fun when we go out there. We don’t need to think about anything. And so that’s how we have fun,” Biles said. Robach also asked the team members a lightning round of questions: Q: Celebrity you most want to meet now that you’re famous? Hernandez: Tori Kelly Kocian: Carrie Underwood. Biles: Zac Efron Raisman: Blake Lively. (Raisman and Hernandez both want to go shopping with Lively.) Q: First food you’re going to eat when you get back. Biles, Douglas, Raisman and Hernandez: Pizza. Hernandez and Kocian: Ice cream. Q: What shows will you binge watch when you get home? Raisman: “Modern Family.” Q: Who's the prankster? Raisman: Laurie's the goofiest one. Douglas: Yeah, she is. Hernandez: Maybe Q: Who's the party animal? Biles: (Points at herself) Douglas and Kocian: Simone. Raisman: Yeah, Simone. Q: Who sleeps the most? Biles and Douglas: Aly. Kocian: For sure, Aly. Raisman: Everyone knew that. Q: If you had to compete in another Olympics event, what would it be? Raisman: Soccer, hockey, figure skating. Hernandez: Track. Biles: Track. Kocian: I don't know, swimming seems cool. Douglas: Javelin. Q: Who has a hidden talent? Biles: (Looking at Hernandez) she can do like crazy things with her mouth. Kocian: Her face just works in so many ways. 0 Shares Email Star Comments " Olympics 2016: ‘Final Five’ Talk ‘Nerves,’ ‘Fun’ of Competition " 'Allied' Review: Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard's Thriller Is 'Nearly Perfect' " Erykah Badu on Music, Family and the Soul Train Music Awards " Corey Feldman Marries Girlfriend Courtney Anne " Video Shows Justin Bieber Allegedly Punching Fan in the Face " Tommy Hilfiger: 'Any Designer Should Be Proud' to Dress Melania Trump " Billy Bob Thornton Opens Up About Humble Childhood " Mariah Carey Breaks Silence on Reported Split With James Packer " Shannen Doherty Teases Photo From 'Heathers' Reboot " Laurie Hernandez Had 'Same Joy' Winning Mirror Ball as She Did Olympic Medals " Spend Thanksgiving Night With OneRepublic, Kelly Clarkson and More " Trump Walks Fine Ethical Line to White House, Experts Say " Wayne State Police Officer in 'Very Grave' Condition After Shooting " Facebook Built 'Censorship Tool' as Part of Chinese Expansion Effort: Report " Thanksgiving Travel Rush: What to Expect Today " Man Injured in Philly Explosion Thought Package Contained Meds: Authorities " Trump's 100-Day Agenda: Experts Examine if It Can Be Done " What Trump Said During Wide-Ranging Interview " Trump 'Seriously Considering' Ben Carson for HUD " Trump 'Leaning' Against Renewed Probe of Clinton, Sources Say " House Republican Criticizes Trump Over Business Conflicts of Interest " Jared Kushner Defends Steve Bannon in Interview, Calls Him an 'Incredible Zionist' " A Look at Gen.

The Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in April withdrew IOI's 'sustainability certification' after allegations the company had illegally chopped down rainforests in Indonesia and planted palm crops on peatland. But earlier this month, it said IOI, one of the world's leading palm producers and traders, had satisfied conditions for the suspension to be lifted, a move that has sparked sharp criticism from environmental groups. Palm oil, used in everything from chocolate to cosmetics, has become one of the world's fastest expanding crops, but the industry has been facing intense pressure over deforestation and methods used to clear land. That has driven many buyers to demand certification of environmentally sound behaviour. Food companies Nestle, Kellogg, Mars Inc and Hersheys, along with healthcare product makers Johnson & Johnson and Reckitt Benckiser told Reuters they had no immediate plans to return to business with IOI despite the latest step by RSPO. Procter and Gamble told Reuters it had ended its relationship with IOI, while Unilever said it was looking into the watchdog's decision. "(We will not change our approach until) we see IOI's upgraded policies enacted, with improvements verified on the ground by an independent group of experts," Nestle said in an emailed statement. IOI officials in Kuala Lumpur said the company remained committed to "engagement with all its stakeholders" and would be "working hard to re-engage with them in the coming weeks and months". "Our focus will now be on the implementation of our commitments, and progress reports detailing delivery against them will be made public on a quarterly basis," said Surina Ismail, its group head of sustainability. Meanwhile, major palm oil trader Cargill Ltd said it was sticking to its decision to suspend business with IOI. Rita Aspen, regional director of corporate affairs for Asia Pacific, said the company would "review IOI's sustainability policy ... before taking further action". Environmental groups such as Greenpeace called RSPO's decision to lift IOI's suspension premature and counter-productive, and urged companies to put on hold buying from IOI. RSPO, a body of consumers, green groups and plantation firms, said its decision to lift the suspension was recommended by its independent complaints panel, and that it stood by "the integrity of the panel" and its conclusions. IOI is one of the RSPO's founding members. "It sends the message that the RSPO is more concerned about helping a founding member regain its customers than ensuring its standards are upheld," said Greenpeace Indonesia forest campaigner Annisa Rahmawati. Around 90 percent of the world's palm oil crop grows in Malaysia and Indonesia. RSPO previously said the suspension would be reinstated if IOI fails to follow through on an action plan to correct environmental shortfalls.

Procter and Gamble told Reuters it had ended its relationship with IOI, while Unilever said it was looking into the watchdog's decision. "(We will not change our approach until) we see IOI's upgraded policies enacted, with improvements verified on the ground by an independent group of experts," Nestle said in an emailed statement. IOI officials in Kuala Lumpur said the company remained committed to "engagement with all its stakeholders" and would be "working hard to re-engage with them in the coming weeks and months". "Our focus will now be on the implementation of our commitments, and progress reports detailing delivery against them will be made public on a quarterly basis," said Surina Ismail, its group head of sustainability. Meanwhile, major palm oil trader Cargill Ltd said it was sticking to its decision to suspend business with IOI. Rita Aspen, regional director of corporate affairs for Asia Pacific, said the company would "review IOI's sustainability policy ... before taking further action". Environmental groups such as Greenpeace called RSPO's decision to lift IOI's suspension premature and counter-productive, and urged companies to put on hold buying from IOI. RSPO, a body of consumers, green groups and plantation firms, said its decision to lift the suspension was recommended by its independent complaints panel, and that it stood by "the integrity of the panel" and its conclusions. IOI is one of the RSPO's founding members. "It sends the message that the RSPO is more concerned about helping a founding member regain its customers than ensuring its standards are upheld," said Greenpeace Indonesia forest campaigner Annisa Rahmawati. Around 90 percent of the world's palm oil crop grows in Malaysia and Indonesia. RSPO previously said the suspension would be reinstated if IOI fails to follow through on an action plan to correct environmental shortfalls. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Corporate News , Plantations , Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil Related Stories Panel to help Malaysia's palm oil products access French market You May Be Interested PPB Group’s Q3 earnings boosted by Wilmar’s contribution Yew Sin-Ee Yi continue fine run in Hong Kong Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Fraud in Felda Global Ventures Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Others Also Read Trump chooses Governor Nikki Haley for U.N. ambassador - news reports M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Japan enlists Sailor Moon to promote safe sex Property Related advertisement Latest News Brexit fallout to cost UK extra £122bil over five years Industrials lift Dow to record, techs drag S&P and Nasdaq (Update 1) Iraq willing to cut oil output in Opec’s plan to boost prices - PM FGV confirms probe is on Felda Iffco’s subsidiary Healthcare stocks drag Wall Street lower Most Viewed in Business Fraud in Felda Global Ventures M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Malakoff seeks RM785mil compensation from EPCC contractors of Tg Bin plant Petronas able to reduce costs with Blue Ocean Strategy Brexit fallout to cost UK extra £122bil over five years FGV confirms probe is on Felda Iffco’s subsidiary Iraq willing to cut oil output in Opec’s plan to boost prices - PM Ringgit opens easier on weak sentiment With US$3b port, Malacca eyes slice of shipping giant Singapore's pie Bank Negara keeps OPR unchanged at 3% advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

They have always seemed to represent and encourage the worst things in the world around us. Before I get too “tired and emotional” I should emphasise that it is not just marketing people who make me feel this way. Lawyers come a close second. And if I see – as I have over the past week – evidence of pain among them, it is hard to hide a quiet pleasure. Part of my distaste for marketing folks is well founded, I believe. But I confess too that part is sheer envy. This began when I was a young journalist in the Financial Times, when I was literally sweating 13-hour days to hit 8pm or 9pm news deadlines. At that time, everyone on the marketing and advertising side of the paper (all males of course) took Friday off on the golf course, arguing that contracts could not be secured without entertaining clients on the fairways. The brazen audacity took my breath away. The fact they succeeded outraged me, and made me deeply jealous. The fact that my venerable employer gave them a four-day week, paid their golf club memberships, covered their green fees and then paid for them to entertain their golf-playing clients, struck me as a scandalous con. But putting this unalloyed envy on one side, I have good reasons for my spite. It is marketing people that take all of our “wants” and on behalf of mainly big-brand companies spin those wants into indispensable “needs”. It is this spinning process, transforming wants into needs that sit at the heart of the consumer obsession that makes “malling” one of the world’s leading pastimes. By creatively and often brilliantly fuelling this consumer obsession (I may hate these people, but I cannot deny the brilliance they sometimes display), they are at the heart of the mindless accumulation of “stuff” that litters our homes and our lives, and puts such pressure on landfills around the world. If I could blame the global environmental crisis and climate change wholly on them, I would, but I suspect that would be a tad too extreme – there are others to blame alongside them. ...it puzzles me so many executives are willing to spend awesome billions of dollars on advertisements on TV or in newspapers and magazines in the profound conviction that the future of their businesses depends on it Because I am an avid and life-long advertisement avoider, it also puzzles me that so many executives are willing to spend awesome billions of dollars on advertisements on TV or in newspapers and magazines in the profound conviction that the future of their businesses depends on it. For example, Procter & Gamble, the world’s biggest advertiser, spends 11 per cent of its total annual revenues – approximately US$7.24bn – on advertising its washing powder, dypers and so on. If everyone else were like me, studiously avoiding adverts wherever and whenever they appear, then this would be money that is wholly wasted and could almost certainly be put to much better use. But of course I have to bite my tongue. It seems not everyone else is like me despite the massive popularity of “ad-blocking” apps that over 400 million internet users download to keep advertisers at bay. There are some people out there who really do read the adverts, seek them out even, happy to be persuaded that the latest fad (Pokemon Go?) is actually a need rather than a self-indulgent want, and are happy to buy the latest Gucci handbag so it can sit unused alongside the many other unused handbags that eventually end up being resold at extraordinary prices through “Milan Station”. So I was pleased this week to discover that the advertising industry is an industry in distress, as the digital giants hoover up an increasing share of global “ad spend” and cast aside those thousands of ad salesmen (most were men) who for so many decades indispensably plied the world’s golf courses securing ad deals from their golf-addicted clients. Company results over the past week from Facebook and Google signalled massive growth in advertising revenues, and prompted predictions that digital advertising will in the next two years pass US$200 billion, for the first time overtaking overall ad spending on TV. Facebook alone reported advertising revenues of US$6.24bn in the second quarter this year, up 63 per cent from the second quarter last year. Growth at Google was lower at around 20 per cent, but its massive scale meant advertising revenue was 50 per cent higher than Facebook. Of course, my pleasure was short-lived, because it was quickly clear that worldwide, the enthusiasm of the likes of Procter & Gamble to spend dizzying billions on advertising is as rampant as ever. Industry stress comes from the astonishing pace of shift to digital advertising, from the rising oligopoly of Facebook and Google, who today account for 72 per cent of the world’s online advertising outside China, and from alarming stories of digital “fraud” in the online advertising industry. This last alarum is fascinating. Out of an estimated US$159 billion spent on digital advertising in 2015, experts say around a third is lost to “botnet”-wielding fraudsters – a cool US$50 billion. A study last year of 10 billion online ads found that for worst-hit companies, almost 40 per cent of visits to ad sites are from computer hackers rather than potential buyers In short, computer hacking networks called botnets infect and capture literally millions of computers and then drive further millions of visits to adverts on key websites. Since most advertisers like Procter & Gamble pay websites on the basis of how many hits their adverts get, the potential to bloat hits by using hacker-generated bots posing as human eyes is immense. A study last year of 10 billion online ads found that for worst-hit companies, almost 40 per cent of visits to ad sites are from computer hackers rather than potential buyers. All the more worrying then that Facebook is introducing technology to make it harder for people to use “ad-blockers” that shield them from the relentless onslaught of advertisers. Industry experts say around 420 million smartphone users currently use one or more ad-blocking app, with a further 200 million on laptop or desktop computers. These are comforting numbers to me, showing I am not alone in my efforts to keep advertising out of my life, but I think all of us know that we are ultimately fighting a losing battle as digital technology allows advertisers to probe deeper and deeper into our lives, redefining what should be regarded as private, and what’s public. Hate them as I may, I think I am doomed to continue envying those marketing and advertising guys in perpetuity.

GE execs are settling into temporary digs in Fort Point, gearing up for an Aug. 22 opening, and planning for a future complex on the Fort Point Channel. The setting is a stark contrast to suburban Connecticut and key to Immelt’s goal of changing the corporate culture. Welcome to Boston, GE. You’re not in Fairfield anymore. A look at GE’s current campus, and how it stacks up with plans for its Boston headquarters. Bob Child/Associated Press/File The basics Fairfield, Conn. (pictured): Two office buildings totaling 495,000 square feet, located on 67 acres of the bucolic Connecticut countryside Boston: Three office buildings totaling 390,000 square feet, located on just 2 acres on the Fort Point Channel and overlooking the Boston skyline Number of employees Fairfield: 800 (at least half were considered corporate employees) Boston: 800 (only about 200 will be corporate types) Typical workspace Fairfield: Think 1970s-era corporate offices, with carpeting and white walls Boston: Think modern collaborative spaces and standing desks John Blanding/Globe Staff/File Site’s history Fairfield: The headquarters facility was built on the site of a former quarry Boston: On the site now stands two old brick warehouses, a surface parking lot, and the site of the former nightclub the Channel (pictured), where big Boston groups such as ’Til Tuesday, the Cars, and the Neighborhoods once played David L. Ryan/Globe Staff/File Parking spaces Fairfield: 800 spaces, some of them enclosed Boston: 30 underground spaces on site; expect the rates to go up in the Necco Street garage (pictured) and the Procter & Gamble-owned lot next door Globe Staff/File Public transit Fairfield: A bus arrives twice every morning; Bridgeport and Fairfield train stations are about 5 miles away Boston: Where to begin? South Station (pictured) is right across the channel, and the Green and Orange lines aren’t far. South Boston residents can squeeze onto the No. 7 bus or the No. 11 Globe Photo/File Commuting nightmare Fairfield: Traffic jams on the Merritt Parkway (pictured), made much worse when there’s an accident or breakdown Boston: That infamous entrance to Interstate 93 North, off Atlantic Avenue, where the backups tend to grind all cars in a half-mile radius to a complete stop Helipad Fairfield: Yes, of course Boston: Somewhere, someday Potential weather threats Fairfield: Flooding on the Merritt; nor’easters Boston: Climate change; sea level rise Globe Staff/File Wildlife Fairfield: Wayward deer, aggressive turkeys Boston: Wayward rats (pictured), aggressive seagulls Globe Staff/File Nearby hotels Fairfield: The city has a few hotels, but only one, the Hi-Ho, is close. There is a 28-room “guest house” on site Boston: A long list within a short walk; the old-school Boston Harbor Hotel (pictured) and the newer Residence Inn and Envoy, to name a few GENERAL ELECTRIC/GENSLER Biggest quirks Fairfield: A 28-room hotel and conference center, aka the “guest house,” that’s free to guests and employees; a 20-foot metal fan-like sculpture, “Turbo”; walking trails; and, as GE’s real estate broker puts it, numerous other features “attractive to discerning corporations” Boston (rendering): The giant “solar veil” rising 65 feet above the roof, one that’s been described as a James Bond villain super weapon; a GE logo of a similar scale, visible from parts of downtown; a GE museum open to the public; a still-undetermined tribute to that rock club the Channel, which closed in the early 1990s Globe Staff/File Nightlife options Fairfield: Nothing in walking distance. But there’s always Barcelona, popular among GE suburbanites, 2 miles away at the Hi-Ho hotel Boston: Lucky’s is one of the area’s longest-lasting denizens, but now it has plenty of company: Barlow’s, Bastille, Blue Dragon, Drink, Menton, Papagayo, Pastoral, Sportello (pictured), and Tavern Road — and that’s just within a couple blocks Jon Chesto can be reached at jon.chesto@globe.com. Follow him on Twitter @jonchesto.

By Evan Clark on August 15, 2016 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway trimmed its stake in Wal-Mart by 15 million shares. REX/Shutterstock The Oracle of Omaha seems to be leaning away from Bentonville and toward Cupertino. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. sold off 15 million shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in the second quarter, cutting its stake by 27 percent to 40.2 million shares worth $2.94 billion, according to regulatory filings late Monday. Over the same three months ended June 30, Berkshire boosted its stake in Apple Inc., buying 5.4 million shares, bringing its stake in the iPhone maker to 15.2 million shares worth $1.46 billion. The quirky billionaire is famous for buying and holding onto companies based on a simple premise like Wal-Mart, which buys at scale and drives down prices to sell goods to lower-income consumers. Buffett started accumulating his investment in the discount giant in late 2005 and since the end of that year, the retailer’s stock has gained 56.7 percent (the issue dipped 0.4 percent on Monday). While it’s difficult to draw direct conclusions from the portfolio shifts at Berkshire, in part because Buffett has brought on board other managers to handle some of the investing, the move from a seller of general merchandise to a seller of ultrapopular smartphones would seem to indicate broader general trends, from the rise of mobile to the increasing competition retailers of all stripes from Amazon. Buffett has dipped in and out of the retail and fashion sectors over the years. The investment house holds a 315,400 shares of Procter & Gamble Co., worth about $26.7 million. The company’s also bought and sold stakes in companies such as Nike Inc. and Seritage Growth Properties Inc., a real estate spin-off from Sears Holdings Corp. arranged by Buffett-admirer Edward S. Lampert. Berkshire also bought underwear maker Fruit of the Loom out of bankruptcy in 2002 and continues to run the company. Buffett, who has backed Hillary Clinton for president, has generally been bullish on the economy. Late last year, he noted: “The interesting thing about the economy is you can give almost the same report ever since the fall of 2009. It really has been growing, is growing, at a couple percent a year, which is not bad. People have gotten more optimistic at times. They thought about a double-dip at times, then they thought it was accelerating.” You're missing something! Activate your FREE PREVIEW now.

The FDA Doesn’t Actually Have The Power To Recall Cosmetics That Harm People Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share The FDA Doesn’t Actually Have The Power To Recall Cosmetics That Harm People Image courtesy of Chris Rief August 15, 2016 4:57 pm EST By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup skin deep WEN by Chaz Dean wen beauty products cosmetics fda food and drug administration Last month, the Food and Drug Administration announced that it would be investigating claims from consumers that the “cleansing conditioner” Wen, purportedly developed by celebrity hairstylist Chaz Dean, had caused scalp irritation and even made some users’ hair fall out. The FDA looked into the situation after receiving 127 complaints about the product, but didn’t know that the marketer, Proactiv maker Guthy-Renker, had received more than 21,000 complaints about the product that it wasn’t obligated to report to the FDA. The manufacturers of medicines and medical products must send any adverse event reports they receive on to the FDA, but cosmetics aren’t as tightly regulated. The New York Times explains that a customer could report a serious injury or even a death that may be linked to a cosmetic product, and companies are under no obligation to report it to the government. The FDA does have the power to recall products that are found to either be mislabeled or contaminated. If the product as labeled and intended causes problems for some users, there isn’t anything that the government can do. There have been efforts to change this law in the past, and different types of cosmetic companies have separate lobbying organizations and favor different levels of regulation. Big companies like Estée Lauder, Procter & Gamble, and Johnson & Johnson favor a version that would require companies to pass adverse event reports on to the FDA, and would also give the FDA the power to recall products that are harmful. Smaller companies, led by Mary Kay, prefer a version that includes the adverse event reporting, but does not empower the FDA to recall products that have been proven to harm consumers. It happens that the less strict bill’s sponsor is Rep. Pete Sessions, whose district in Texas is near the headquarters of Mary Kay, and who has received campaign contributions from Mary Kay employees and other industry executives.

"William Shakespeare has 99% positive global recognition, and by creating The International Shakespeare Project, we are providing brand partners – large and small - a cultural, entertainment and educational icon without equal," said Citron. The Shakespeare "brand" includes a collection of iconic characters and plays that have entertained millions of people all over the world. This is an incredible legacy that will inspire a generation of new productions, including a Broadway musical based on the true life story of Shakespeare and his family, already in development. Shakespeare continues to draw the attention of the largest advertisers in the world. Just this week, P&G launched a major Shakespeare campaign as part of their Olympic sponsorship. The International Shakespeare Project has already selected Think Shakespeare as its first educational program reaching students from 8 to 18. The Shakespeare Channel, launching later this year, will be the first mobile network streaming content in Augmented Reality reaching 14 countries About The Actors Hall of Fame The Actors Hall of Fame Foundation is a nonprofit 501 (c) 3 organization based in Culver City which honors lifetime achievement by actors in Film, Television and Theater.

But then after that it’s just kind of like go, go, go again,” said Simone Biles, who won Team USA’s first-ever Olympic vault gold medal on Sunday in Rio. Her fellow team member Madison Kocian took the silver medal in the uneven bars event, while teammate Gabby Douglas placed seventh. Kocian, Douglas, Biles and teammates Aly Raisman and Laurie Hernandez sat down with ABC News’ Amy Robach in Rio, where they discussed the pressure to excel. “We all have nerves, but at this point it’s kind of autopilot,” Biles said. “We’ve done these routines so many times that once we go out there … it’s just one more.” Hernandez agreed. “We’re just going to go to training, do what we’ve been doing, not change a thing because that’s working really well,” she said. The “Final Five” have already won gold in the team all-around event, and Biles took a separate gold in the individual all-around competition. “We were very confident once we went out there,” Biles said of her team’s win. “If we had done the same thing in training then we were very confident of the outcome.” The team members had an emotional reunion with their parents at the P&G Family Home — where Olympic families come to relax and watch the games, have a meal, drop off their laundry and even get pampered with free salon services for women and hot shaves for men. It was the women’s first chance to show off their new hardware, hug their families and regroup. The gymnasts say it’s their incredible sisterhood that keeps them laughing as they enter the home stretch of the games. “We’ve been together so long,” Kocian said. Their time together — and their bond — helps their performance. “We’re just so ready that’s it’s fun when we go out there. We don’t need to think about anything. And so that’s how we have fun,” Biles said. Copyright © 2016, ABC Radio. All rights reserved.

Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Will Be a Holiday 2016 Gold Mine Facebook Inc Warning: Slower Growth Means Lower FB Target Price Recent Posts: Facebook Inc Insider Stock Sales Pile Up (FB) Muni Bonds Are a Key to Making America Great Again Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) Stock Is a Long-Term Crowd Pleaser View All Posts Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) collects less than 5% of the $500 billion spent on advertising annually. The social media giant must dominate emotional ads, a segment that made television the world’s dominant marketing force, and the precision type of ads that built Alphabet Inc (GOOG, GOOGL) to achieve the dreams of founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, according to The Seattle Times. Good at One So far, FB stock has cracked the second half of the equation by following in the footsteps of Google and locking down “direct response” advertising. For instance, if someone has a store in California that sells books, then he/she would want to find people who are in the market for purchasing books. If someone types “books California” into Google, the the store can then pay to show its link. 9 Stocks to Buy That Will Sprint Past Everything Else Direct response ads make up a large portion of online advertising as they make it easy for companies to find people who are looking for exactly what they are selling. Facebook is good at this type of advertising as well because people tell the social networking site who they are and what they like. But is dominating direct response ads (along with Google) enough for the social networking giant? No. FB Stock Needs to Dominate This Lucrative Segment Also On TV commercials, around $200 billion is spent annually, mostly on branded advertising. Brand ads, for instance, include commercials of smiling families traveling by an Audi through a mountain range, the report says. Brand ads make up a large part of advertising apart from the internet. Also they are lucrative. According to analysis from Bloomberg Intelligence, the average price to reach 1,000 people with a prime-time TV ad in 2015 was $50. In comparison, the ad price on Facebook was $5, the report says. FB stock wants these brand ads desperately. The social media giant is like the Super Bowl every night for advertisers and their $500 billion in annual spending, said Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s Chief Operating Officer. This could be wrong though, the report says, adding that more than 1.1 billion people use the social network daily, and around 110 million users watch the Super Bowl telecast. Home Depot Inc: Earnings Will Make HD Stock a Market-Beater Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG), the world’s biggest advertiser, told The Wall Street Journal that it found targeting niches like teenage shavers on Facebook generated too narrow an audience for P&G brands, which needs to sell millions of Gillette razors and bottles of Tide. P&G said it would not spend less money on the social media giant, but it and some other big advertisers appear to be falling back towards TV.

Ogg August 15, 2016 9:05 am EST Print Email Tweet Stocks managed to hit a new high in the week of August 12, and the markets were indicated up on Monday morning. Despite the S&P 500 being valued at 18.1 times forward earnings, low interest rates and a lack of choices for return keep driving investors toward stocks. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each morning of the week. The goal is to find new investing and trading ideas. Some of these analyst reports cover stocks to buy. Other reports feature stocks to sell or avoid. One interesting issue to consider now is that it would really only require the upside from seven of the 30 Dow stocks to get to DJIA 20,000 in 2017. These are the top analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations seen on Monday morning: Best Buy Co. Inc. (NYSE: BBY) was downgraded to Hold from Buy and the price target was cut to $36 from $39 (versus a $34.87 prior close) at Jefferies. The stock has a 52-week trading range of $25.31 to $39.10 and a consensus analyst price target of $33.14. Dollar General Corp. (NYSE: DG) was downgraded to Hold from Buy and the price target was cut to $96 from $101 (versus a $92.91 close) at Jefferies. The 52-week range is $59.75 to $96.88, and the consensus price target is $99.80. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ: INTU) was maintained as Sector Perform but the price target was raised to $113 from $93 at RBC Capital Markets. The stock has a 52-week range of $79.63 to $116.97 and a consensus price target of $110.47. McDonald’s Corp. (NYSE: MCD) was downgraded to Hold from Buy at Argus. The shares have a 52-week range of $87.50 to $131.96 and a consensus price target of $130.29. Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) was raised to Buy from Neutral with a $105 price target (versus an $87.04 close) at B. Riley. The 52-week range is $65.02 to $87.45. The consensus price target is $90.56. Symantec Corp. (NASDAQ: SYMC) was started with a Buy rating and was given a $26 price target (versus a $22.54 close) at Goldman Sachs. The consensus price target is $23.28, and the 52-week range is $16.14 to $22.58. Merrill Lynch is out with Buy ratings on the three major Chinese wireless and telecom stocks. China Telecom Corp. Ltd. (NYSE: CHA), China Mobile Ltd. (NYSE: CHL) and China Unicom (NYSE: CHU) were all reinstated with Buy ratings. China Telecom is actually the firm’s top pick of the three, as its free cash flow yield will double to 9% with an attractive valuation with 32% implied upside. The firm believes that China Unicom’s sharp free cash flow yield turnaround will drive a rerating.  China Mobile was given 24% implied upside with rapid 4G migration and a mobile data traffic boost.

The ones that learn by readin’. The few who learn by observation. The rest of them have to pee on the electric fence for themselves.” "A fool and his money are soon elected." "An economist's guess is liable to be as good as anybody else's." "Try to live your life so that you wouldn't be afraid to sell the family parrot to the town gossip." "If all politicians fished instead of spoke publicly, we would be at peace with the world." And one that---Zounds!---appears to be much more applicable to the other team this year than ours: "I belong to no organized party. I am a Democrat." Happy Monday.  Cheers and Jeers starts below the fold... [Swoosh!!] RIGHTNOW!

Black, Jr.  All you have to do is guess whether he's talking about Donald Trump or a child being potty-trained: “He has three or four good days and then makes another gaffe.  Hopefully, he can have some more good days.” If you said Mr. Black was referring to Donald Trump, you win.  Although we understand if you thought it was the kid---it’s been ages since Trump has been able to go ”one” day without a gaffe.

Winning the Ingredient of the Year Award in the Healthy Aging category at a trade show in Geneva, has provided Cork seaweed minerals company Marigot with very welcome international recognition. The win, according to Marigot Commercial Manager David O’Leary, is another strong indication that seaweed is now achieving global recognition as a superfood. Marigot, which is based at Carrigaline and has harvesting and production facilities in Castletownbere, has been in existence since the early 1990s, when it was set up by Les Auchincloss, a previous owner of Biocon. READ NEXT Firms lose Luas court appeal A pioneer in the study of the nutritional value of seaweed minerals, the company created two product ranges for use as an ingredient in foodstuffs, one for human consumption and one for animal feeds. The product range for the agri-feed sector, which improves digestion and rumen conditioning in cows, is called Acidbuf, while the food ingredients and supplement industry range is called Aquamin. With these two brands, Marigot now has sales in 40 countries globally and a turnover of in excess of €20m. The biggest success until now has been in selling to agri-feed sector which accounts for 70% of turnover, but Mr O’Leary believes that the growing recognition of the benefits of seaweed will help the company to significantly increase sales of Aquamin in the future. Produced from seaweed harvested in Iceland, Aquamin is used in food products and supplements. Engaged in continuous research and new product development since it was set up, the company has, over the last 10 years, devoted significant resources to conducting scientific research to demonstrate the efficacy of its products. “We have undertaken extensive scientific programmes covering multiple areas of bone, joint and digestive health which are of particular strengths for our products,’’ says Mr O’Leary, adding that Aquamin is proving effective when used in food supplements by people suffering from osteoarthritis and osteopaenia. “We now have proven scientific evidence from multiple trials while Aquamin has been named ingredient of the year in the healthy aging category at the Vitafoods Exhibition in Geneva – a significant European event in the food supplements industry.” The largest markets for Aquamin products include the US and Europe and customers include the likes of Frito Lay (Pepsico), Del Monte and Procter & Gamble. Australia, Europe and South Africa are the largest markets for the animal feed product range. Mr O’Leary says that over the last six to seven years, the company has achieved growth of in excess of 10% per annum. Selling 95% of its products abroad, Marigot won the High Growth Markets Exporters Award for 2015 from the Irish Exporters Association. Sales have been boosted by the launch in recent years of Margot’s first consumer products which are sold directly on a new company website, www.osean74.com. Mr O’Leary says that sales have been going well and that Marigot is working on developing further products which can be sold directly to consumers. The company, which now employs a staff of 30, is anticipating continued growth of in excess of 10% this year. “We expect continued growth in existing markets and also plan to develop new markets. The focus will be on increasing sales in South America, Asia Pacific and the Middle East and North Africa where we see scope for growth”. In 2017 the company will also continue working on product development. It plans to add to the five product lines for the agri-food sector and develop products in new areas in addition to ones for digestive and bone health. In the food and food supplement area, Mr O’Leary says Marigot will aim to take advantage of the increasing recognition of the benefits of seaweed minerals and the fact that there has been a 147% increase in the launch of seaweed flavoured products in the last five years.

It’s only been done once before, in the Winter Games. Although not necessarily one of the high-visibility glamour events perhaps, Rhode won a bronze in yesterday’s skeet shooting competition at the Rio Olympics. She won her first medal, a gold, in the 1996 Games in Atlanta. Rhode captured the bronze after an intense shoot-off with China’s Meng Wei at the Olympic Shooting Center. “It’s a stunning accomplishment from Rhode, who becomes the first female Olympian to medal in six consecutive games, and the first summer Olympian as well. Only Italian luger Armin Zoeggeler has done it on the men’s side,” USA TODAY explained. “Rhode’s Olympic history has been nothing short of dominant. She won gold in the 1996 Games in double trap at the age of 17, then followed up with bronze in Sydney, gold in Athens, silver in Beijing, and then gold in London.” Southern California resident Rhode, 37, plans to compete at the Tokyo Olympic Games for Team USA in the year 2020 and even has her eye on 2024 if Los Angeles winds up as the host city. “The act of shooting requires fewer physical attributes, extending Olympic lifespans,” NBC Olympics observed. Congrats to @KimRhode, the 1st female Olympian to medal in 6 consecutive games! @USAShooting Photo by @kevinjairaj pic.twitter.com/38cZBz14sT — USATODAYSportsImages (@usatsimg) August 12, 2016 In recent years, she has had overcome some serious personal health challenges such as a difficult pregnancy and gall bladder surgery, as well as illnesses among her family and close friends. “As the younger shooters on the U.S. team traveled the world, sharpening their skills, winning competitions she used to dominate, Rhode struggled to walk around the block. Back on the range, her strength returned slowly,” the Los Angeles Times recalled. Upon winning the bronze medal in Rio, Rhode told Fox Sports that “It doesn’t matter if it’s the gold, silver or the bronze. It’s the journey and my journey this time was very, very challenging and as you can tell, very emotional. I’m still emotional.” Prior to her Olympic medal win in Rio, Kim Rhode weighed in on gun control and gun rights in an interview with Time. “The Second Amendment was put in there not just so we can go shoot skeet or go shoot trap. It was put in so we could defend our First Amendment, the freedom of speech, and also to defend ourselves against our own government.” She also suggested in the Time exchange that the media seems to attach a stigma to competitive shooting as it relates or doesn’t relate to the ongoing gun control debate. “When you are talking to a NASCAR driver, they’re not asked to comment on an incident that occurred with a vehicle.” Rhode described the San Bernardino terrorist attack as heartbreaking tragedy but one that apparently provides further justification for law-abiding citizens to carry firearms. American Kim Rhode becomes first woman to individually medal in 6 straight Olympics. #TeamUSA #Rio2016 https://t.co/j815U1M8pF — FOX Sports (@FOXSports) August 13, 2016 That stigma apparently prevents Olympic shooters like Kim Rhode from receiving lucrative corporate sponsorships (apart from a few gun manufacturers) from which other medalists benefit. “Will we see Rhode on a box of Wheaties? Most likely not. The shooting sports are no different than any other sport and the qualities of shooting champions are the same qualities we value from other great athletes: dedication, determination and hard work,” PJ Media insisted. “The big mystery is how someone like Kim isn’t part of the Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, and the Olympics sponsor push. It would be nice to have an Olympic sponsor recognize the magnitude of her accomplishment,” Kim Rhode’s agent commented on the situation according to Bloomberg News. Kim Rhode also chided the new, stricter California gun control regulations enacted after San Bernardino. “I shoot 500 to 1,000 rounds a day, so having to do a background check every time I purchase ammo, or every time I want to bring ammo in or out of a competition or a match, those are very challenging for me. Also, I’ve had guns in my family for generations that have been passed down, and now I’m going to register them as assault weapons… It definitely does effect me and gives me a reason to speak out more.” <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DwMg7CYi7kA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> She revealed to the Guardian that she supports Donald Trump for president, in part because of his strong support for the Second Amendment, the right enshrined in the U.S. Constitution to keep and bear arms. She acknowledged that electing a female president “would be incredible, just not Hillary.” “She also startled a French reporter when she told him that she has her three-year-old son in youth programs with the National Rifle Association,” the Guardian added about Olympic medalist Kim Rhode.

"This is an extremely chaotic situation right now, with life-threatening flood waters, power outages and road closures complicating relief efforts – as many local volunteers have also been directly affected by the flooding," said Brad Kieserman, vice president, Disaster Services Operations and Logistics for the Red Cross. "This is by far our largest sheltering effort in Louisiana since Hurricane Isaac, and the bulk of this staggering devastation is in areas that typically don't experience flooding. The Red Cross is mobilizing a massive relief effort which could be our largest since Hurricane Sandy." Thousands of people have been forced from their homes with little but the clothes on their backs. Red Cross disaster volunteers are opening shelters, providing meals and comfort. Additional volunteers, relief supplies and emergency response vehicles are moving toward Louisiana now to bolster response efforts. "Our work is just beginning, and we will be on the ground for weeks helping people in Louisiana pick up the pieces," continued Kieserman. "Entire families have lost their homes and everything they own, please join the Red Cross in supporting Louisiana by making a much needed financial donation today." Flooding is expected to continue for several days, and once waters recede it will take some time to fully uncover the extent of the devastation. The Red Cross will be working closely with partners in the days ahead to ensure people receive the help they need as quickly as possible. Flooding is also threatening communities in Mississippi, where Red Cross volunteers provided safe refuge to nearly 70 people Saturday night. HOW TO HELP  To help people affected by the Louisiana Floods, visit redcross.org, call 1-800-RED CROSS or text the word LAFLOODS to 90999 to make a $10 donation. Donations enable the Red Cross to prepare for, respond to and help people recover from these disasters. FLOODING SAFETY INFORMATION  The Red Cross has steps people should follow to remain safe: 1.     Be prepared to evacuate at a moment's notice and heed evacuation orders when given. When a flood or flash flood warning is issued for your area, head for higher ground and stay there. 2.     Stay away from floodwaters. 3.     If you come upon a flooded road while driving, turn around and go another way. If you are caught on a flooded road and waters are rising rapidly around you, get out of the car quickly and move to higher ground. Most cars can be swept away by less than two feet of moving water. 4.     Keep children out of the water. 5.     Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize flood dangers. DOWNLOAD EMERGENCY APP Download the free Red Cross Emergency App to receive emergency alerts and information about what to do in case of flooding and other disasters, as well as locations of shelters.

Patanjali Ayurved will invest Rs 500 crore in four mega shelters for cows across the country. The four ‘gaushalas’ or cow shelters will work on improving productivity of Indian cows up to 10 times. “We are setting up four scientific cow shelters. The first one will come up at Uttarakhand,” Ramdev said. Baba goes bullish Rs 500 crore investment on 4 mega shelters for cows across India 5 food parks in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Assam Nagpur food park to focus on dairy products and protection of cows 10,000 tonnes capacity addition for food products To invest Rs 750 crore in research on ayurveda Meanwhile, Patanjali said it will file defamation case against Advertising Standards Council of India Apart from investing in research on cows, Patanjali has spent Rs 250 crore for research on usage of ayurveda in modern life. It will spend another Rs 500 crore (Rs 5 billion) on research, Ramdev told reporters on Saturday. To ramp up its production capacity, Patanjali is setting up five mega food parks. Land parcels have already been identified and work will start within this year. “We have bought 230 acres of land in Nagpur and 200 acres in Andhra Pradesh. We will set up three food parks in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Assam,” he said. Ramdev said his dream it make Patanjali the largest player in fast-moving consumer goods segment with annual revenue of Rs 50,000 crore (Rs 500 billion). The food park at Nagpur, which is expected to become operational in next couple of months, will focus on dairy business and cow protection. While Patanjali already sells dairy products such as ghee, Ramdev wants to expand both the portfolio and reach. Taking a dig at the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) - the self-regulatory body in the field of advertisement - Ramdev alleged it is targeting Patanjali because it is run and controlled by multinationals. He said Patanjali will soon file defamation case against ASCI. Patanjali has received 27 show-cause notices in recent months from the advertising body. “Its governing members constitute firms like the Hindustan Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive and PepsiCo, among others. ASCI is deliberately targeting us as we have become a major concern for multination firms. When we decided to take legal action against ASCI, it offered us a membership. We are writing a letter highlighting all their wrong-doings to the government of India,” Ramdev said.
