How P&G's latest minor sales uptick could strengthen into solid long-term gains. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Oct 6, 2016 at 1:15PM Image source: Getty Images. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) recently gave investors a big reason to feel bullish about its growth outlook. After a long period of flat or declining sales volumes, the company managed upticks across each of its five product divisions last quarter. That improvement led to a sequential increase in organic revenue growth for just the second time in over two years. And if you believe management, P&G is just at the start of what could become a long streak of above-average growth numbers. Let's take a closer look at the consumer goods giant's prospects for a sustained rebound. Recent wins The best news from P&G's most recent quarter was its improving organic growth metric. Sales rose at 2% pace, compared to 1% in the prior quarter. Look deeper and there's even more cause for celebration: The growth was powered by volume gains and not just higher prices. That's important because it suggests robust demand trends that P&G can build on in future quarters.  On the other hand, the company is still having trouble defending its market share from a wide range of competitors. Kimberly-Clark managed 4% higher volume last quarter on its way to a 3% boost in overall organic sales. A 2% volume gain for Unilever, meanwhile, helped it outperform P&G in broad growth, too.  The pessimistic way to read that result would be to knock P&G for losing ground to rivals even during its modest rebound. Yet investors could also see this as good news in that it shows that stronger growth is possible even if the weak global selling environment doesn't improve over the short term. Bright possibilities CEO David Taylor and his executive team believe they can achieve "balanced" growth soon, which they define as strong sales gains paired with healthy improvements in both profits and cash flow.  Investors have a good idea what that would look like. Now that the company's portfolio transformation is complete, P&G is aiming for organic growth that's a full percentage point higher than before -- in addition to a 2-percentage-point improvement in operating margin.  The latest quarter's approach shows how P&G might achieve this aggressively optimistic result. Executives directed cash raised from its massive cost-cutting initiative toward marketing and innovation. The marketing payoff was significant thanks to initiatives like getting trial runs of the latest Gillette razor into the hands of millions of young men, or introducing 70% of new moms to Pampers diapers.  Prepare for a slow rebound Even if this strategy continues to work, investors shouldn't expect a quick return to market-thumping growth. P&G projects that the next 12 months will bring organic gains of 2%. Sure, that's a solid improvement over last year's 1% uptick, but it still implies flat or shrinking market share across much of the portfolio.  With shares  near all-time highs, investors are betting that Procter & Gamble is on the cusp of a prolonged growth rebound. In any case, it's very likely that the company will produce higher profits and a significant boost in cash flow. Those wins at least will power surging cash returns to shareholders over the next few years. But for a new growth trajectory to take hold, P&G will need to show several consecutive quarters of positive sales volumes -- ideally leading to overall organic growth that matches or exceeds that of its global rivals. A change of that magnitude isn't easy for a $240 billion business like P&G's. However, with the help of a revamped portfolio and major investments in the operations, the company has its best chance in years at speeding up its sales gains.

Opera's 2017 festival mixes old favorites, new wave Janelle Gelfand , jgelfand@enquirer.com 2:40 p.m. EDT October 6, 2016 In this production of "The Magic Flute" for Los Angeles Opera, Papagena (Amanda Woodbury) and Papageno (Rodion Pogossov) finally find one another. (Photo: Provided/Robert Millard/LA Opera) Cincinnati Opera’s 2017 Summer Festival will include two grand operas: “La Boheme” conducted by Louis Langrée in his company debut, and a whimsical production of “The Magic Flute” on the Procter & Gamble stage at the Aronoff Center. Also on tap will be the company premiere of “Frida,” an opera about Mexican artist Frida Kahlo by Robert Xavier Rodriguez, in the smaller Jarson-Kaplan Theater at the Aronoff Center. And there is a unique collaboration planned with the Cincinnati ensemble concert:nova of “Song from the Uproar,” by the fast-rising American composer Missy Mazzoli. It will be separately ticketed as a special event. The 2017 Summer Festival will be Cincinnati Opera's second season at the Aronoff Center, while its home, Music Hall, undergoes an extensive renovation. The three-production series (including one in the smaller theater) is a reduction from the 2016 season’s three grand operas and the world premiere of "Fellow Travelers" in the Jarson-Kaplan Theater. The company explained that it has offered a three-opera series – as opposed to its longtime tradition of four – on occasions such as the 2010 season, when it had the extensive production demands of Wagner’s “Die Meistersinger.” Next year, Mozart’s “The Magic Flute” will be the blockbuster production, coming from Komische Oper Berlin. Cincinnati Opera is also expanding its single-ticket offerings with four performances each of “La Boheme” and “The Magic Flute.” Puccini’s “La Boheme” will open the season (June 15, 17, 22 and 24) in Procter & Gamble Hall. A co-production with English National Opera, it is set in the 1930s and was last seen at Cincinnati Opera in 2010. Nicole Cabell, who recently starred as Rosalinde in “Die Fledermaus,” will sing the role of Mimi. Soprano Jessica Rivera will perform the role of Musetta. Sean Panikkar will make his company debut as Rodolfo. The other bohemians include Edward Nelson as Schaunard, Rodion Pogossov as Marcello and Nathan Stark as Colline. Langrée, music director of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, will make his company debut leading his own orchestra in the pit. Natascha Metherell is stage director. And the company will continue its partnership with Cincinnati Boychoir, which will provide the boys' chorus in "La Boheme." “Frida,” a 1991 opera in Spanish about the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo by Robert Xavier Rodriguez, will be presented in seven performances June 23-July 8 in Jarson-Kaplan Theater. Kahlo's short, painful life and tempestuous marriage to the muralist Diego Rivera (to be sung by Ricardo Herrera) became well-known after the 2002 movie, “Frida.” The production, created for Michigan Opera Theatre in 2015, will star Catalina Cuervo as the portrait artist. Jose Maria Condemi will return to stage the opera. Andrés Cladera conducts. The season concludes with Mozart’s “The Magic Flute,” July 15, 20, 22 and 23 in Procter & Gamble Hall. Created for The Komische Oper Berlin, the production was described by Berliner Morgenpost as “a deliciously absurd mixture of silent film and cartoon." Besides Germany, the production has appeared in Los Angeles and Minneapolis. The unique concept is by Barrie Kosky and “1927,” a London-based company that specializes in combining performance and live music with animation and film. It will be sung in German.

Matthew/LA Opera) The large cast includes Aaron Blake as Tamino, Kim-Lillian Strebel as Pamina, Jeni Houser as Queen of the Night, Tom McNichols as Sarastro, Rodion Pogossov as Papageno and Alexandra Schoeny as the First Lady. (Other cast members will be announced.) Daniel Ellis directs and Christopher Allen, Cincinnati Opera’s resident conductor, will conduct. In a special presentation, Mazzoli’s “Song from the Uproar” will be mounted in collaboration with concert:nova July 17, 19 and 21 in the Aronoff Center's Fifth Third Bank Theater. The libretto is by Royce Vavrek. Cincinnati Opera will kick off its 2017 season with a free, Spanish-themed program on June 11 in Washington Park, featuring stars from the mainstage season. The company is also planning its signature programs such as Back to the Zoo, Opera Goes to Church and Temple and other events. The Summer Festival will return to Music Hall and its “Opera Campus” surrounding Washington Park in 2018. Subscription renewals will go on sale this month, with new subscriptions available in November. Single tickets will go on sale in Spring, 2017.

SUBSCRIBE PPC + SEO = match made in marketing heaven Are your SEO and PPC teams working in silos? Columnist Julian Connors discusses several ways SEO and PPC can combine efforts to improve their strategies and drive more conversions. Julian Connors on October 6, 2016 at 10:23 am More It has been quite a year for the Search Engine Results Page (SERP). We’ve seen numerous algorithm updates, including a final Penguin update and the introduction of Possum. We also saw major changes to the way ads are displayed on desktop SERPs. Google continues to tweak how online consumers receive content through organic and paid listings. In order to meet the demands of today’s search landscape and connect with more qualified consumers, strategists need to create campaigns that treat SEO and PPC as a unified silo, as opposed to separate disciplines. Google’s never-ending quest for SERP perfection The ongoing adjustments to the SERP layout are meant to help Google better align with consumer objectives by improving the content quality and relevance of listings. While this certainly allows Google to become a better service provider for online consumers, it also presents new challenges for SEO strategists. Each adjustment requires strategists to develop new methods for ranking within prime search listings. Integrating SEO with PPC Developing digital marketing campaigns that combine SEO with PPC is not only necessary for achieving prime listing positions, it’s now the only way to maximize traffic and conversion opportunities. As the former Organic Search Manager for a Fortune 500 brand that specializes in home care, I was responsible for developing comprehensive, complex digital campaigns that focused on consumer behavior alignment and conversion optimization. When our team made the effort to combine both SEO and PPC strategies/data, we were able to identify a multitude of critical data points dedicated to consumer behavior, intentions and location/geography. This level of precision allowed us to: modify our organic keyword strategy so that we could create and optimize new content to rank within specific geographic locations, applying exact phrases used by our target audience to align with their intentions; adjust our PPC budgets so that we were only running ads within the most popular markets and effective time frames; and align our PPC ads with their offline marketing schedule to maximize awareness and conversions. Overall, these actions resulted in: 30-percent increase in organic traffic 25-percent increase in paid clicks 35-percent savings in ad spend 20-percent increase in quarterly profits Sharing information to create one rockstar team Most digital marketing agencies are built with SEO and PPC sitting on opposite sides of the building. Both teams work tirelessly, developing keyword strategies, creating unique content and employing a number of tactics that focus on attracting online consumers. Even though each team uses different systems and tactics to drive conversions, there is a tremendous amount of critical data that can be used to create a synergistic and harmonious relationship, bolstering results for everyone. Check out the following ways that SEO and PPC can combine efforts to improve their strategies, as well as to drive conversions like never before. Share keyword data to increase the intelligence of your campaigns Keywords are the foundation for any successful SEO or PPC campaign. For PPC strategists, keywords are used to facilitate creative relationships with consumers who are located further down the conversion funnel. In the world of SEO, keywords are used to dictate the information architecture of a website, as well as its content strategy. Both teams conduct keyword research in order to identify terms that align with their target audience’s online behavior, project traffic growth and drive qualified conversions. Because more consumers are using long-tail phrases and complete sentences when searching than ever before, keyword data must be shared across both teams in order to offer coordinated messages that keep brands top-of-mind and solicit qualified conversions. Set shared goals and combine metrics Using the information both teams collect doesn’t just offer more accuracy around consumer behavior; it can also be used to support your brand’s inbound marketing campaigns. Teams that combine their PPC data with organic user engagement metrics (e.g., average session duration, bounce rate, pages per session) are able to gain unique insight around how consumers are interacting with certain digital properties, as well as how they behave once they leave your site. The metrics your SEO and PPC teams review in order to establish their key performance indicators (KPIs) should be almost identical. When this happens, you are able to apply this information to other marketing channels like PR, social media or email marketing. Remove silos to improve production Approaching SEO and PPC as two separate silos isolates critical information and diminishes the productivity level of even the most well-executed online campaigns. It almost never makes sense to keep these two disciplines apart, as the teams can offer each other particular points of information that are vital for identifying and fulfilling conversion opportunities. Use data that informs cross-channel decisions and justifies action When it comes to gathering enough actionable data to develop robust, intelligent strategies, extracting information from one specific field, like SEO or PPC, is not enough. Although the quality of your organic data may provide insight on how to create functional plans, the amount of verified information organic search can capture may not be sufficient to justify real action. Conversely, information that’s gathered from the search engines themselves as a result of paid search activity is both valuable and based on a substantial sample size that allows you to move forward confidently. If your organization treats SEO and PPC as two distinct entities, try to make sure that your efforts are aligned through shared: reporting; objectives; and communication portals. The goal of merging both disciplines together is not to have the same people performing the same type of work. Instead, it is meant to increase internal awareness of key conversion opportunities. Action & impact: how to maximize SERP visibility Now that we have covered the principles that allow your SEO and PPC teams to work together efficiently, use the following tactics to own as much real estate within Google SERPs as possible. Landing page optimization Optimizing your landing pages to drive qualified traffic and conversions is a fundamental component of any digital marketing campaign. SEO strategists can provide their PPC counterparts with critical information around consumer intentions, objectives and demands to reduce bounce rate and increase click-through-rates (CTR). PPC strategists can then use their insights around consumer online activity to perpetuate paid ads that only appear in front of the most qualified consumers possible. By doing this, both teams are able to support each other in ways that improve user experience, maximize relevant traffic and reduce wasted ad spend. Approach SEO & PPC holistically Running paid ad campaigns that 1) offer precise messages and 2) are located next to your organic listings on Google can increase overall CTR and lead to a higher return on your investment. While managing the online campaign of Sonos in 2015, our team ran paid ads alongside keywords that the electronics company already ranked for organically. This type of positioning was extremely effective for creating the sense that we were more prominent than our competitors and thus, more credible. Because of this, total revenue through organic and paid channels increased by 37 percent year over year. Understand seasonality Share seasonal data and information relating to other offline variables to learn how to approach and optimize for specific times throughout the year when consumer activity peaks. Use this information to create a calendar of events that guides you on how to: create organic content that aligns with specific consumers within specific locations; run paid ads that contain unique messaging based on location and intention; maximize brand awareness during peak activity points like the holiday shopping season; and increase consumer reaction and conversions during seasonal low points. Get in front of the competition SEO and PPC strategists should work together as a cohesive unit to share key points of information that highlight how and what the competition is doing from a digital perspective. Create monitoring systems that identify your competitors in terms of: positioning within SERPs; pricing; key message points/branding initiatives; and primary and secondary keyword terms. Use this information to adjust your ad spend, to improve CTR and to outrank your opponents by taking up more real estate within SERPs.

Photo: Abhishek B.A./Mint Bengaluru: In 1999, British entrepreneur Kevin Ashton coined the term ‘Internet of Things’ while he was working at Procter & Gamble. Around that time, he made a presentation on putting sensors in everyday objects that would be powered by the Internet. Shortly afterwards, he co-founded a research centre in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology called the Auto-ID Centre. Since then, Ashton founded three more companies in IoT. In an interview on the sidelines of the Nasscom Engineering Summit on Wednesday on IoT’s evolution and challenges. On a lighter note, when asked about the US presidential elections, Ashton said emphatically, “Trump won’t win. He doesn’t stand a chance.” Edited excerpts: It’s been 17 years since you coined the term ‘Internet of Things.’ However, overall results in terms of scaling up have been mixed. Is IoT facing a mid-life crisis of sorts? I think I am! (laughs) No—the very interesting thing that you see about the Internet of Things is…when it works, it’s kind of invisible. Like all good technology. Just as a simple example, if you look at the rise of the smartphone, one of the funny things about smartphone is that it’s got the word ‘phone’ in it today — because it’s not what it is. It’s not a phone. Phone is an app that sometimes you use — so, what is a smartphone? Some say it’s a pocket-sized computer. But that’s not really it either. At least not how I look at it because a typical smartphone today has as many as 10 network sensors. That’s twice as many as a human being. So it’s a very sentient platform—and the obvious sensors are for example, cameras, microphones, etc. But your smartphone knows where it is even when you don’t. It measures things like barometric pressure—many of them can detect your heartbeat or fingerprint or your moving. The vision of the Internet of Things is network sensors. Also Read: Indian IoT market to touch $15 billion by 2020: Nasscom And the smartphone is just a visible example of a network sensor platform—the irony is that just because it’s called a phone nobody seems to realise it. My view is that we’re 15 years into a 100-year roll-out. So, I think if there’s any sort of crisis to IoT, it’ll be a teenage sort of crisis… we’re still in a very early growth phase—I don’t think we’ve grown up yet. IoT deployments are moving at a much slower pace than was originally hoped. In many organisations, it’s still at a proof of concept stage. Why is the IoT facing challenges in scaling up? It’s a software challenge that you have right now. We got very good at gathering sensor data. Sensors have become very cheap, networking has become very cheap—the new challenge is how to automatically process that data. In the 20th century, you got some data and you put it on a spreadsheet and everybody looked at the spreadsheet. In the 21st century, the machine looks at the data and figures out what’s important and what to do with the data. There’s some complexity there—technological machine learning is getting better all the time, but that’s the limit right now. What are the futuristic applications of IoT that seem like science fiction now? The technology points to what you call autonomous automation. So, we think of automation right now, we think of giving machine a task, it executes a task, it stops. What will happen in the Internet of Things age is that’s the back-loop that’ll keep turning. The machine will change something in the world somehow, they will then sense that change and then figure out what to do next with that change. Any examples that you can think of? The easy one is self-driving cars. That’s coming very quickly everywhere... So this sort of continuous autonomous automation which will start with self-driving cars, I think that technology will start applying itself in the home where you’ll see things like more sophisticated vacuum cleaners, things like laundering which today is barely automatic—that’s the kind of stuff that you’re going to see. Continuous autonomous automation. How does India compare with the tech boom that you saw in the US? The first time I came to India I came as a student and I got a tourist railway pass. I was in Bombay and then I travelled around the country kind of in a clockwise direction. I always told my Indian friends that I’ve seen more of India than they have. Because of the direction of travel, Bangalore was one of the last places I came to and the contrast between Bangalore and what was Calcutta back then and Delhi and Bombay was very striking. And so, it’s always amazing to come back here and remember what it was like. And that’s representative of the changes around the world. Which is the age of United States as a world technology leader is really over—which is very surprising to Americans because they talk about Facebook or Google. But if you look at what’s been going on in the market, US tech exports is sort of flat to declining and then you have Asian nations particularly China, Korea, Singapore and India that are on the rise. And what’s fuelling that is very interesting to think about when you’re in Bangalore — which is what drove America to technological excellence in the 20th century was the establishment of some major technology universities between 1900 and 1950 and then significant government investment in science and research and development between 1950 and 1970. And those investments laid the foundation for, take for example, all the tech companies of the dotcom boom, and we’re seeing the end of that tail now with Google and Facebook. Now if you look at what’s happened in Asia, you basically see the same path only a little later. There’s an investment in education in technology, followed by government investment in pure science and R&D which is inevitably followed by an expansive technology sector that is supposed to be disruptive to more mature tech economies. If you think of India with that pattern in mind, you have IITs everywhere, which in the 20th century exported its undergraduates to places like MIT but now they are coming back….What you see in India is also an amazing space program right here in Bangalore, increasing investment in defence and development. And what that is inevitably leading to is India becoming not just an offshore-outsource subsidiary centre of technology, but also a leading exporter of high technology and leading user of high technology. I expect that we really are at the beginning of the Indian technology revolution…They’re going to form amazing technology companies and they’ll do it in areas like the Internet of Things which is new and disruptive…It’s great to come here and talk about the Internet of Things because my expectation is that 5-10 years from now, India will be one of the top three IoT tech exporters in the world. You’ll be competing with China and possibly South Korea.

The Mom Project matches employers with women seeking challenging but flexible assignments that keep them in the game. Zara Kessler ZaraKessler October 5, 2016 — 11:07 AM EDT Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Allison Robinson looks young for a mom, let alone a chief executive officer. But, days from turning 30, she’s both—the mother of a 14-month-old son and an even younger company, the Mom Project, which matches women who want flexible work with employers who want them. Robinson had been at Procter & Gamble since college, most recently working on the Pampers brand as a senior account executive for the North America baby-care market and strategy team. While on maternity leave, she read about the many highly qualified mothers who leave their jobs. Returning to work after a leave can be difficult, and women’s earning power can take a hit. “I felt like the decision of being a full-time career mom or a stay-at-home mom was too binary, and I wanted to create a solution in between, that allowed moms to stay professionally engaged through rewarding, challenging work to keep their skill sets current,” said Robinson, who lives in Chicago with her husband, Gregory, a business operator at a private equity firm, and their son, Asher. Allison Robinson Source: The Mom Project Robinson never went back to P&G. In early April, she launched her “digital talent marketplace.” The service, for which more than 6,500 people have signed up, is mainly for women but will help connect anyone with work ranging from project-based, its focus, to permanent.1 For employers, it can provide skilled female candidates eager to work in flexible roles. The Mom Project, free to job hunters, collects information on their backgrounds and aims and on companies' needs. In candidates, it looks for an undergraduate degree, at least, and five years of work and verifies education and employment histories before someone gets an offer. Employers pay Robinson a service fee of 20 percent of what they pay their new hire. The business has signed up more than 150 employers, including Hyatt Hotels and Penn Mutual Life Insurance Co., and more than 50 have made a match or are close to making one. Resources such as iRelaunch are for women who want to return to work. Après has a job market, while the nonprofit Path Forward focuses on midcareer internships at companies for people following a caregiving stint.2 Robinson said she’s looking to keep millennial women in the workforce, by letting them scale back when they need to. The brand new network currently has some older members. It took Kate Thomson, 37, to the marketing department at Penn Mutual, in Horsham, Pa. She’s on site Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. for an initial six months and has Penn Mutual’s permission to maintain her clients in a consultancy she started in the summer of 2015. The setup allows her to get her five-year-old on the school bus for kindergarten and drop her two-year-old at preschool before work, then reverse the process on the way back. “So it’s almost like they won’t even know I’m gone,” she said. “Which is sort of incredible.” Before she began consulting, Thomson had spent 15 years in marketing and advertising, telecommuting the last several years but with a lot of travel. She came across the Mom Project on Facebook. “I want to wear clothes and talk to grownups,” she said. “But I don’t want to sacrifice my children’s babyhoods for that, and I did that for a long time.” Ten days into her new schedule, Thomson wrote by e-mail that things were going well. She was treasuring spending time with her kids, “soaking them in,” she wrote, but “there's a special joy to be found in commuting BY MYSELF,” when “nobody is touching me or needing things.” Still, untraditional work arrangements may not come with benefits, and years of project-based work could leave a woman ill-prepared to ratchet her salary back up for full-time work. And not every job pans out.  Catherine Siris, 34, a millennial mother of two, had already left her career. The Hershey, Pa., resident has an MBA from George Washington University and completed Johnson & Johnson’s human resources leadership development program. She hasn’t been employed since she had her first child, who is three. “I feel like I’ve lost a piece of my identity, because [career] was such a big part of my life,” she said. The Mom Project submitted her as a candidate for a four-month, full-time, remote position in recruiting, which she thought would be a good test of whether she was ready to return to work full time. Siris, who has also signed up for Après, recently learned from the Mom Project that the company is holding off on the role until early next year.  Robinson doesn’t have a monopoly on flexible work. The Second Shift helps find projects for experienced women; it takes a 5 percent cut when processing a member's payment from an employer and charges the employer 15 percent. MomSource Network charges users a one-time $50 fee and focuses on finding people flexible, long-term positions.3 FlexJobs, at $14.95 a month, with quarterly and yearly options, boasts tens of thousands of job listings. Prokanga offers a network of “vetted flexible talent” and charges that talent 20 percent of their payments.4  If Robinson’s venture expands over time, it will be harder to maintain an intimate environment. Both Thomson and Siris had introductory calls after signing up. Now that isn’t feasible, Robinson said, and the service is trying to engage women digitally.  And scale requires money. So far, Robinson and her husband have been financing the business themselves. The company is working toward closing a round of funding. Robinson took Thomson to a brick-and-mortar office. She may one day return Siris to work. Courtney Hyde, 40, found a job at the Mom Project itself. Hyde, who has a three-year-old daughter, was working as an account executive for LinkedIn Talent Solutions when she saw a Facebook ad for the Mom Project. She signed up in March, before the official launch, looking for project-based or part-time work, wanting a sense of what was out there. Instead, she got a phone call from Robinson and, in June, joined the company full time as vice president of sales, responsible for building and maintaining the base of its employer partners. A big company might want to support working parents, gain employment flexibility through peaks and valleys, or bring in an expert for a project without paying a consultant’s fee, Hyde said.  Employers also come to the Mom Project, signing up on the digital platform. Interface, an Atlanta-based maker of modular flooring with a focus on sustainability, became a partner after Global HR Director Jillian Adams saw an article about it on LinkedIn and was drawn its similar focus on purpose. In the traditional staffing model, Adams said, you deal either with headhunters (or recruiting agencies) who find full-time professionals or with staffing agencies that fill temporary and permanent positions with less-specialized workers. To find highly trained experts to work as consultants, it usually takes a formal consulting or specialized vendor, she noted. A mom Interface hired through the network will soon start a job in communications on a project basis.  In the grand scheme of things, it isn't clear whether millennials or Gen X-ers or anybody will find it easier to navigate flexible work, keeping a baby toe in the workforce while caring for babies. On a smaller scale, there’s Asher, who started walking several weeks ago, with both Mom and Dad in attendance. It was late afternoon, in their basement, where Robinson and her toddler hang out because it’s carpeted. “I feel like I’m making sacrifices to make this model work,” she said. “Being there was a taste of what I want to solve for.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 5 October 2016 | MYT 9:00 AM Advertising on mobile: it's all about 'stopping the thumb' Mobile addiction: Estimates suggest that the average person looks at his or her smartphone as much as 150 times a day. — AFP Relaxnews NEW YORK: Almost 80 years old, the deodorant Old Spice is learning new tricks for finding customers in the era of smartphones and social media.  The Procter & Gamble product, having spoofed itself for years with advice on how to become more "mantastic," posts to its 2.6 million Facebook followers a steady stream of videogames, prize entries, and advertisements as short as two seconds.  Creating "thumb-stopping" content is the goal, and marketers are doing everything they can to achieve it. That includes using neuroscience to study which visual and audio cues offer the best bet to grabbing and keeping an impatient smartphone user's attention.  Estimates show that the average person looks at his or her smartphone as much as 150 times a day. The attention is there, but it's just not long-lived.  "You get the three-second audition," said Frank Amorese, media director at Heineken USA. "If you are relying on the 14th or 15th second to do the heavy lifting of the ad, it's not going to work."  Ever-changing mobile landscape  Advertisers are in a dizzying race to connect with customers as new mobile-borne social media platforms emerge and evolve.  "The landscape changes every six months," Amorese said. "It's changing at an increasingly fast rate."  Digital ad spending is projected to reach US$72.1bil (RM297.57bil) in 2016, growing at a rate of 21% and now comprising almost 37% of the overall market, according to eMarketer. Social media accounts for US$15.4bil (RM63.55bil) of this.  Heineken has doubled its spending on digital ads to 30% over the last five years.  The dominance of smaller mobile devices has heightened the challenge of capturing the attention of potential shoppers.  Ads must be tailored depending on whether they are being seen on a widescreen television, a tablet or a smartphone and must not demand too much time if a consumer is merely glancing at a feed and not planning on a lengthy stay.  "We have to really identify how do consumers engage with every single platform and then what is the creative experience we need to give them," said P&G chief brand officer Marc Pritchard at the four-day Advertising Week conference in New York this week.  "But it also has to look like one brand because people have 5,000 ads coming at them every day and that's 10 times what it was just 10 years ago."  Measuring 'sharing velocity'  Anna Fieler, chief marketing officer at PopSugar, a women's shopping and content site, said marketers are devising benchmarks like "sharing velocity" to monitor resonance.  "Shareability is the gold standard of how engaged people are," she said. "People like it so much that they want to share it with someone else."  Not all Ads place the brand front and centre. Frito-Lay, which spends about 40% of its advertising budget on digital media, offers tips on its Facebook feed on professional mentoring and networking, in addition to the usual fare of ads that aim to excite and amuse.  "People are using social media to build their (personal) brand," said Jeff Klein, vice president of brands and portfolio marketing. Sometimes Frito-Lay just "takes a little bit of a back seat."  'Upload videos like crazy'  Much of the buzz at the Advertising Week conference was the wildfire growth of video streaming and broadcast of live events.  Facebook vice president Will Platt-Higgins predicted video could comprise 80% of all smartphone content by 2020.  "You've got the perfect marriage of basically a supercomputer, which is in your pocket, plus super powerful wifi, plus a video composer and a high-definition camera," he said.  "All of that together creates the perfect storm for all of us to upload videos like crazy and that's what's happening."  The growth of video also opens up new opportunity for rivals like Twitter, which has lagged Facebook in terms of building profits from ads.  Twitter posted 18% growth in advertising revenue last quarter spurred by video. It is betting that marketers will see more upside in plans for live events in pro football and other sports.  Video "is the number one ad format for us now and it barely existed a year ago," said Matt Derella, vice president of global revenue and operations at Twitter. "It's risen extremely fast and it's driven by consumer behaviour." — AFP You May Be Interested Russia begins process to block Linkedin website Huawei eyes Africa with Nova Toms launches Apple Watch wrist bands Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official China badminton star Lin Dan apologises for affair with model while wife was pregnant Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Fundraising walk sets new record Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot The Star's executive editor Soo Ewe Jin passes away advertisement Latest News US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins Toyota sharpens focus on electric cars through new in-house unit Most Viewed in Tech Hotlink Fast: Get 17GB of data with the new Internet pass Sign your name digitally in iOS Mail Toyota sharpens focus on electric cars through new in-house unit Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead White supremacist ad allowed on Twitter, CEO apologises Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Oct 4, 2016 at 7:44PM Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) stock recently touched $90 per share -- just a few percentage points below an all-time high. The consumer goods titan is up 20% in the last 12 months, making it one of the best-performing members of the Dow. That share-price gain seems to clash with P&G's sinking business trends. Organic growth slowed to just 1% in 2016 from 2% the prior year and 3% in fiscal 2014. However, the company is managing important financial and operating wins that help explain why investors are so optimistic about its stock right now. 1. Cost cuts Every blue chip business is looking for ways to cut costs, but few have had as much success as P&G. It has sliced down its expenses on cost of goods sold to the point where it is saving nearly $1.5 billion per year -- beating the $1.2 billion goal management set in 2012. PG Cost of Goods Sold (TTM) data by YCharts. Since 2012, costs in just that category have dropped by $7 billion. P&G plans to achieve even better results ahead, targeting $10 billion of cumulative productivity savings through fiscal 2021. These improvements promise to send profitability higher.  2. Cash flow One of P&G's core long-term financial targets is to achieve cash flow productivity, or the ratio of free cash flow to adjusted earnings, of at least 90%. The company has trounced that target lately. In fact, P&G generated $12.1 billion of free cash in the past 12 months on earnings of $10.5 billion, yielding a ratio of 115% of earnings. This increase has helped keep cash returns to shareholders rising even as earnings decline due to to a weak selling environment, brand divestments, and foreign-currency moves. 3. Marketing P&G is a skilled marketer -- and that success goes far beyond simply putting out effective TV advertisements at global events like the Olympics. While any company with a large budget can make an international splash like that, P&G's marketing reaches an entirely different level. Image source: P&G. For example, its relationships with hospitals across the country helps it get trial samples of Pampers diapers to 70% of new moms. And when it launched a new Gillette razor recently, its marketing department succeeded in getting a trial product into the hands of 80% of young men. 4. Cutting its losses The company has proven itself ruthless when it comes to walking away from market segments that don't offer the right mix of sales and profit growth. This month's $11 billion sale of its beauty business to Coty is just the single biggest example, but there are over 100 more including P&G's exiting of the value-priced Mexican tissue paper niche. Overall the company has whittled its portfolio down by 105 brands representing 15% of its 2013 sales but just 6% of earnings. Going forward, that shift should produce a leaner, faster-growing, and more profitable company. 5. Cash returns P&G's cash returns have always played a key role in the total returns that shareholders can expect from this stock. In the five years ended in fiscal 2015, the company delivered $60 billion to investors at a pace of about $12 billion per year. Smaller rival Kimberly-Clark, in contrast, has returned about $2 billion per year to shareholders over the last decade. FY = Fiscal year. BN = Billion. Image source: P&G investor presentation. While Kimberly-Clark's return outlook is stable at just below $2 billion, P&G's is soaring. The company expects to deliver $22 billion to shareholders this year on its way to $70 billion in the three years ending in fiscal 2019. These significant wins have helped power solid gains for P&G shareholders lately, but the successes won't mean much if the company can't begin clawing back lost market share. The projected uptick to 2% organic growth this year is encouraging, but it would represent only a small step toward that goal. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos has no position in any stocks mentioned.

And not just any soccer fan, of course. MLS Commissioner Don Garber is paying a visit to the Queen City on Nov 29 when FC Cincinnati's highly-aspirational owners will aim to show him that their club - and indeed their city - deserve a Major League Soccer team. Garber recently announced that MLS plans to expand to 28 teams and, assuming Miami will gain the 24th spot (though this is far from a given), FC Cincinnati have quickly become one of the favourites to land one of the remaining four places. Competition is tough, however, with Garber making recent visits to Sacramento and Detroit, and St Louis also in the reckoning. That possibly leaves just one place to fight for - and even with expansion fees potentially rising to $200 million - FC Cincinnati, with their amazing attendances, want to show Garber why they stand out from the crowd. Tonight's attendance for #CINvCHS is a new #FCCincy AND @USL record... pic.twitter.com/0R52v5cmX5— FC Cincinnati (@fccincinnati) October 2, 2016 "Soccer is the most popular sport in the world and it's catching up in the United States. It's a sport on the rise and, guess what, Cincinnati is a city on the rise," FC Cincinnati general manager Jeff Berding told The Telegraph.  "We're a very hot city right now - for jobs, businesses, arts and entertainment, the population is growing. We're one of the top cities for new graduates, we're growing our international presence both in companies and people from other parts of the world coming to Cincinnati.  "FC Cincinnati is riding the wave of a city on the rise and a sport on the rise - our timing was perfect and I think we're really demonstrating how soccer is experiencing tremendous growth in the United States and the future is only going to be greater." He added: "[Commissioner Garber] is coming for a full day. Everyone who is familiar with soccer knows that if FC Cincinnati is drawing 20-30,000 paid spectators there must be something going in Cincinnati. So we're going to show him the city.  "We're going to show him first-hand a lot of the development that is growing in the urban core that coincides with an appeal for soccer.  "We're going to see the facilities at Nippert Stadium that meet high standards and will continue to be enhanced and improved.  "There is an opportunity to have a Town Hall meeting with our supporters, similar to what the Commissioner has done in other cities.  "And there will be a chance for some of the business leaders in town - Procter & Gamble and some the Fortune 500 companies that are based here in Cincinnati - to hear about their thoughts on Cincinnati being possibly some day a MLS city." FC Cincinnati have shattered all kinds of attendance records in their first season in the third tier United Soccer League. An incredible 35,000 people came to Nippert Stadium in July  to see their friendly against Crystal Palace and last weekend they drew 30,187 for their play-off match with Charleston Battery, which was nearly 10,000 more than the previous best - 20,886 set by Orlando City in the 2013 USL Cup Final. Best of luck in your first ever play off match, @fccincinnati! 🔴🔵 #RiseTogether pic.twitter.com/AZz7bOJihM— Crystal Palace F.C. (@CPFC) October 2, 2016 As impressive as these attendances are, Berding knows that FC Cincinnati still need to improve the club's entire infrastructure to help make the case to Garber. Much of what he intends to do came from meetings with MLS officials at the All-Star Game this summer and principally include developing their youth programme and training facilities. The club also plan to  make soccer-specific renovations to Nippert, notably widening the pitch. "I said on Sunday that  the loss in the play-offs was not the end of the FC Cincinnati but the beginning, it was just the end of chapter one," Berding added. "We showed up bright and early on Monday to start chapter two. We're not going to stop until we're lifting trophies and playing at the highest level available to us here. "We have to be better at everything we do. We won 16 games, we came in third, but we weren't good enough and we didn't get through the play-offs and have a chance of winning the cup.  "John [Harkes, the head coach] and I are meeting with the players and we will go through an evaluation process on everything we do - from the front office, the medical staff, the coaching staff and the players so that we can have an even better club next year.  "We'll have an advantage in that we'll not be building from scratch. Our core is very strong, I think we showed from what we do our standards are very high. "We're going to grow more season ticket holders. We're renewing at a 99% per cent renewal rate. We're looking at 8,000 tickets and the off-season is only three days old. I think 10,000 season tickets will be attainable and that will show a sustainability about what we're trying to get done.  "We averaged a 17,000 attendance this year - let's average 20,000 next year. We're going to do better with sponsorships, we're going to do better with broadcasts - this year we put all our home games on TV, next year we're going to look at putting all our games on TV, including road games." The Bailey is here in force for the #WhiteOut! pic.twitter.com/2UXqO6J8Ho— FC Cincinnati (@fccincinnati) October 2, 2016 FC Cincinnati are also making waves internationally, too, and following the hugely popular friendly with Palace, Berding is coming to England in late October to try to set up another. "I have some folks setting up some meetings for me, some clubs have expressed an interest in us in doing some things. We'll see if there's any opportunities to do things in December-March or coming up to the new season in May or in July as we did with Palace. "We'll consider taking the team on the road. We've been an enormous story in the soccer world. We epitomise the growth of soccer in the United States. We're a city with no real soccer history of any magnitude and out of the blue achieving what we've achieved shows the growth of the sport in the US." It is possible that all the improvements - and costly ones, too - FC Cincinnati are making will be for little if it does not lead to a MLS invitation. But Berding does not see it that way, his intention is simply to make FC Cincinnati "the best professional franchise we can be". "Cincinnati is a major league sports town," he adds. "We're in a league that is very aspirational, a lot of USL teams moved to MLS and we look to follow in their footsteps. Having said that, we're respectful that  MLS will have their own process and timeline and we know we will have to earn their confidence and the opportunity to be invited. .@fccincinnati GM and former Councilmember Jeff Berding says soccer, Cincinnati are "on the rise." #FCCincy #fccday pic.twitter.com/TjPWnuGkX1— City of Cincinnati (@CityOfCincy) October 5, 2016 "We're very happy in the USL. You had a team like Orlando City, it took them five years to move up and other teams it took longer. We're not impatient by any means but having said that there's a lot to like about Cincinnati.  "We have an ownership that has the resources to make the jump, a professional venue with 35,000 seats with suites and premium seats. I think the management of our team has shown to be of high standards and the support from the market is I think second to none when you look at other expansion contenders.  "We're very bullish on Cincinnati. It's a great market. We've proven it this year and we're going to improve on it next year. Ultimately, the MLS will have its own process and we're going to give it our best shot." Wednesday marked FC Cincinnati Day in the Queen City to mark the team's achievements on and off the field in their inaugural season.  City officials will need to come up with an even grander celebration should FC Cincinnati gain that coveted MLS place.

The German company spent $3.6 billion in June to acquire Sun Products, which was created in 2008 via a private-equity-backed spinoff from Unilever operations in Trumbull. Henkel has its North American headquarters in Rocky Hill, where it had about 420 jobs, according to the most recent records on file with the state of Connecticut. With Sun already employing about 200 people in Wilton, Henkel will create an additional 266 jobs in the state, according to the office of Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, giving the governor another significant economic development win after an announcement last month about an agreement to keep the headquarters of Lockheed Martin subsidiary Sikorsky Aircraft in Stratford. Henkel’s consumer goods headquarters has been located in Scottsdale, Ariz., but with the recent acquisition of Sun Products, the company has decided to combine those operations in Stamfordt. Some 375 Arizona employees will be offered the option of relocating to Connecticut, according to the Phoenix Business Journal. Stamford has several office buildings with available space to accommodate the number of people Henkel is bringing together there, including downtown offices formerly occupied by UBS and General Reinsurance, and the sprawling former headquarters of Pitney Bowes in the city’s South End. With brands like All, Snuggle and Wisk, Sun Products is the second-largest seller of laundry products in North America; the market is dominated by Procter & Gamble. In the Henkel move from Arizona, Stamford will assume status as the head office for Dial soaps, one of many Henkel personal care and beauty products sold on store shelves coast to coast, as well as a broad portfolio of adhesives, sealants and surface treatments for consumer and industrial use. “The decision to relocate is a result of our evolving business needs and we are thankful to Arizona and its leaders for many years of partnership and support in the community,” said Jens-Martin Schwaerzler, president of Henkel’s North American consumer goods division, in a written statement. “We are looking forward to the future, building on our more than 20-year partnership with the leaders and communities of Connecticut.” To fund the move, the company will participate in the state’s First Five Plus program, which is operated under the state Department of Economic and Community Development. Under the program, the company will receive a 10-year, $20 million low-interest loan toward the relocation. It may also be eligible for up to $5 million in tax credits through the Urban and Industrial Sites Reinvestment Tax Credit program, which allows for a corporate tax credit of up to 100 percent of capital investment. “When an international company of Henkel’s stature decides to relocate to our state, expand its operations, and create hundreds of new jobs, it sends a message to the rest of the world that Connecticut is serious about working with companies to grow, generate capital investment, and strengthen our economy for the residents of our state,” Malloy stated. “Henkel is a valued member of the business community. We are proud of their decision to relocate and expand in Connecticut and we welcome the company to our state.” Henkel expects the relocation of its operations will start in the second quarter of 2017, with the process completed by the first quarter of 2018. It has yet to pick a specific site in Stamford. “This is just another example of the positive business environment found here in the state of Connecticut and is reflective of Henkel’s confidence in Connecticut’s workforce talent,” Stamford Mayor David Martin said in a statement. “The city of Stamford has taken steps over the last few years to create a business climate that attracts companies like Henkel. I look forward to working with them as a corporate citizen for years to come.” State Sen. Carlo Leone, D-Stamford, said Henkel’s decision to move is just the latest company to bet on Connecticut and it shows the state is on the right path. “Just last week I voted for an agreement that will keep Sikorsky in Connecticut where they will grow and create new jobs,” he said in a statement. “Pratt and Whitney and Electric Boat have also announced their intention to each create thousands of new jobs in Connecticut. Henkel is just the latest piece of good news showing that Connecticut’s economy is moving toward a much stronger future.” Today's Deals Powered by SHOP NOW Air Hogs Helix Sentinel 720p Video Drone for $128 + free shipping WalmartPosted 22 hr 21 min ago SHOP NOW Play-Doh 60th Anniversary Celebration 60-Pack for $15 + pickup...

This year the board of directors voted to move it to the fall hoping to have a better turnout. They figured the summer was not a good time since there are family vacations. In the fall, everyone has returned to bowling and beginning the new season. Reasoning had it that award winners were more available then. The night for the long-awaited annual awards banquet is almost here. It will be held October 15 at Holiday Lanes in Westport, catered by New Bedford’s Riccardi’s Italian Restaurant. Hopefully, the fall will be the perfect time to celebrate and say farewell to the preceding season. Ticket sales so far have been lackluster, though, and there is still time to purchase tickets. The banquet will begin at 6:30 p.m. with cocktails, followed by the buffet. After the meal, the awards will be presented. For the first time in the history of the banquet, the association and Holiday Lanes in Westport will offer a fun bowling tournament following the awards presentation. The tournament will be a nine-pin no-tap format featuring a red pin that will turn up somewhere in the pin setup. If the red pin appears as the head pin and the bowler gets a strike, a (small) prize will be given. Children will be allowed to bowl for free, but will not be eligible for prizes. The awards portion of the banquet will feature presentation of handsome plaques engraved by Chadwick’s Trophies in New Bedford to the bowlers who bowled 300 games, 800 series and women’s 700 series during the 2015-16 season. Also, winners of each event in the association tournament that was held last March at AMF Somerset Lanes will also receive a plaque. Bowlers of the Year in four separate categories will be honored. The first one is Bowler of the Year which is the Jim Rusin Memorial Bowler of the Year award sponsored by the Rusin family. This year’s Bowler of the Year happens to be Jim’s twin brother, John Rusin. The female Bowler of the Year is Amy Robinson. Her award is sponsored by P&G Corporation, owners of Wonder Bowl, Holiday Lanes in Westport and E. Providence Lanes. The Senior Bowler of the Year is Charlie McConnell. His award is the Dave “The Bear” Senior Bowler of the Year which is sponsored by the Charette family in memory of their brother who was an avid bowler and passed too early at a young age. The final Bowler of the Year award is the Super Senior award. Paul Moser earned the honor which is sponsored by the (Brett) O’Connor family. The highlight of each year’s awards banquet is the induction of bowlers into the SMUSBC Hall of Fame and this season is no different. The 2016 Hall of Fame Class includes three talented and well-deserving bowlers - Alex Aguiar, Jonathan Van Hees and Joey Nereu - all inducted for bowling ability. Tickets to the event are $25 and for the optional bowling tournament, there’s a $10 entry fee. For tickets, contact Stephanie Millward, banquet chairman, at 508-730-7715, as soon as possible. Bowling tournament tickets will be available for purchase at the banquet. The SMUSBC Board of Directors looks forward to seeing you there and helping to make this year’s banquet a memorable occasion. UPCOMING EVENTS The Massachusetts State USBC Youth Association 34th annual Singles Tournament is November 6 at Westgate Lanes in Brockton. Entry fee is $25 per bowler and entries close on October 16. Entry forms may be downloaded from www.mausbcya.org. The Massachusetts Women’s Bowling Association 36th annual State Senior Tournament is November 5-6 at Town Line Luxury Lanes in Malden. Entry fee is $40 per bowler and entries close on October 21. Entry forms are available at all area tenpin centers. HIGHLIGHTS Correction to an item in last Sunday’s (Sept. 25) column: It was incorrectly reported that Evan Thro was fourth in the Junior Bowling Sport Challenge in Auburn in the under 15 division. He was actually in fifth place and Sam Blanchette was fourth. Jeff Palmer, in the Westport Trios League at Holiday Lanes in Westport, bowled an 805 series that included a 299 and a 289 game. Jamie Travassos, in the Junior Program at Holiday Lanes in Westport, bowled a career-high 299 game that was 104 pins over his average on Sept. 24.

different user groups, disposable diapers can be divided into baby diapers and adult incontinence products 1. Baby Diapers In 2015, the size of global baby diaper market reached around USD54.3 billion; the main consumption areas including Asia, North America and Western Europe accounted for more than 70% of consumption. Baby diapers have seen wide application and a market penetration rate of 90% or so in North America, Western Europe, Japan and other developed countries, in contrast to less than 60% in the Chinese market, which shows the huge potential for development. In 2015, the Chinese baby diaper market reported consumption of 27.4 billion pieces and size of about RMB29.5 billion. In the next five years, with the improvement of China's urbanization rate and per capita disposable income as well as the opening of "two-child policy", the size of baby diaper market is expected to maintain an over 10% growth rate to hit roughly RMB51 billion by 2020. In China, imported diapers have occupied about 50% of baby diaper market share, even an absolutely advantageous share of 80% in high-end baby diaper market. In 2015, key players in the Chinese baby diaper market were P&G, Unicharm, Kimberly-Clark, Hengan International and Kao, which had a combined market share of 70%.

The Lowdown is Ad Age's weekly look at news nuggets from across the world of marketing, including trends, campaign tidbits, executive comings and goings and more. Bud Light's New Design Credit: Bud Light Anheuser-Busch InBev is close to overtaking PepsiCo as the nation's top sponsorship spender, according to a new ranking. The two NFL sponsors opened up a sizeable gap on third-place spender Coca-Cola Co., according to the annual ranking by sponsorship consultancy IEG, which calculates sponsorship fees in the U.S. and the portion of international spending dedicated to the U.S. PepsiCo spent between $365 million-$370 million and $375 million, according to IEG estimates. A-B InBev is not far behind as its spending jumped from $300 million-$305 million in 2014 to $360 million to $365 million last year. Coke, which ended its "American Idol" sponsorship in 2014, retained the No. 3 spot, but its spending fell from $290 million-$295 million in 2014 to $275 million-$280 million last year. General Motors, which dropped its NFL sponsorship in 2014, fell from fifth to ninth and is now behind Ford. Here is the top 20, courtesy of IEG: U.S. Top 20 Sponsors chart Credit: IEG Here is more proof that Nike won the Olympics: Three of the marketer's ads made Ace Metrix's list of the top 10 breakthrough ads from the third quarter. Placing first was Nike's 145-second digital spot about Paralympian runner Scout Bassett. The ad (below) is part of the "Unlimited" campaign that got heavy airplay during the Olympics. The fifth and 10th-place ads also belonged to Nike. Frosted Flakes took the second spot with its "Let Your Gr-r-reat Out'" ad that features an 11-year-old girl in a wheelchair at a skate park. Tying for No. 2 was a long-form ad from Olive Garden, while BMW took third place with an ad featuring a Paralympian. "Nike, Frosted Flakes and BMW all delivered humbling and inspiring messages, making that strong emotional connection that engages viewers," said Peter Daboll, CEO of Ace Metrix. Pampers' 'Pooface' Credit: Pampers What brand delivers the world's best customer experience? Surprisingly, Pampers, according to WPP's brand experience agency Group XP, which found the Procter & Gamble Co. brand edged Disney and Paypal. Pampers' end users are notoriously hard to survey, but the algorithm behind the ranking is really based on such factors as branding, store design, content, online presence and user experience, based on data drawn over a 10-year period by WPP sibling Millward Brown's Brand Z. Amazon actually scored first in the U.S. on customer experience, followed by Pampers, with the two flipping the top two spots in the U.K. Rival Kimberly-Clark Corp.'s Huggies also did well, coming in 12th globally and fourth in the U.S. With so many babies having such great diaper experiences, the world's future is undoubtedly bright. Clorox Co. is better known for bleach and cleaners than snack foods, but that may be about to change. The company, which also markets Hidden Valley Ranch and KC Masterpiece, is rolling out a social media campaign to back an extension of its Soy Vay line of Asian sauces and marinades into Asian-flavored snacks. A #SnackHour hub on Tumblr, launching Thursday, is backed by social media influencers who include Matt Bellasai, formerly of BuzzFeed and a People's Choice "Social Media Star of the Year." Soy Vay also will get paid advertising on Tumblr and Facebook, public relations and sampling programs. AKQA, Current and the in-house Clorox Digital Labs are handling the effort. For years – at least since Fusion launched in 2005 – people have wondered what fully new system P&G's Gillette would come up with next. Some speculation has focused on a razor with heated blades. Well, now that system is here, but it's not from Gillette. SmartRazor is hitting the market, kind of, with a Kickstarter campaign that launched yesterday. The backers are not just scruffy bootstrappers who know nothing about bending metal. They also sell ShaveMate razors with shaving cream dispensed from the handle and backed via direct-response ads featuring prolific pitchman Anthony Sullivan. SmartRazor CEO Lou Tomassetti said he's gotten keen interest in the heavily patented SmartRazor since a 2015 teaser showing at CES, and most recently from big retailers. Now, he's just looking for the capital to make it. Another formerly scruffy startup, Dollar Shave Club, recently sold to Unilever for $1 billion, is poking a bit of fun at its parent-to-be in the yet-to-close deal in a new in-house campaign for its latest line extension – Wanderer body wash and bath products. The ads lampoon muscle-bound imagery from P&G's Old Spice or hormone-infused ads akin to Unilever's Axe of old (though the body-wash bottle in question looks more like Suave), with a voiceover from Dollar Shave Club CEO Michael Dubin asking: "How about a shower product that's more you?" Chobani is eager to post more videos with BuzzFeed's Tasty after a successful Olympic-themed run. Tasty, which has been around for a little more than a year with its food-focused videos, said Chobani was one of the first brands it partnered with back in December. This summer, Tasty aired three Chobani videos produced by BuzzFeed with a bit of a different look and feel from Tasty's regular content. The videos included shots of athletes Morgan Brian and Marlen Esparza instead of focusing just on the top-down recipe preparation shots Tasty is known for. The most popular video showed soccer player Ms. Brian preparing a chicken, quinoa and avocado salad. In all, the three videos reached nearly 154 million people, with more than 83 million views, 1 million likes, and about half a million shares, BuzzFeed said. Those figures were exponentially higher than results from other Chobani videos Tasty posted in late 2015 and early 2016. Both sides said they learned throughout the process, noting for example that videos were shared more often when they included the word healthy when discussing a recipe. Chobani, which pays for views, not engagement, said the 1.2 million likes/shares and comments across the videos topped its engagement expectations. Chobani and Tasty are working on projects for the upcoming holiday season that may include experimenting with Tasty's Nifty or other franchise brands. Tasty has also worked with food brands including Mondelez and Diageo. It may still feel like summer in parts of the country but the fall and winter soup season is heating up. Progresso's new batch of spots tout that it is the first large U.S. grocery store brand using only antibiotic- and hormone-free chicken breasts in all of its chicken soup. The spots mark the General Mills' brand's first work from the Joan Agency and feature voiceover by actor John Lithgow. The Progresso spots show off the brand's new packaging featuring a redesign worked on by Hornall Anderson that marks Progresso's first big packaging makeover in more than 10 years. Advertising Age Player The next spot set to air after one that launched the campaign in late September is "Opus" (above), which should run from Oct. 10 through mid December. Another one of four new spots set to run later in soup season is "Contained," which focuses on the brand's broth (below). Advertising Age Player Cincinnati-based Nehemiah Manufacturing, which gives second chances to orphan brands, ex-convicts and people recovering from addictions, is branching out with a new brand – Saline Soothers. The saline-infused wipes, aimed at preventing irritation for people wiping runny noses, are something of an adult-positioned extension of the Boogie Wipes brand the company sells for kids (and their parents). With this launch, Nehemiah is also for the first time incorporating its social mission into its consumer marketing, said VP-Marketing Eric Wellinghoff. Packages of Saline Soothers include a new "2C" logo and message "Every purchase helps provide jobs for Second Chance Employees." About half of Nehemiah's 100-plus employees have done time on felony convictions or are recovering from drug and alcohol problems. Saline Soothers are backed by a video, directing people to buy the product at Walgreens and Rite Aid stores, from Molio, the Salt Lake City, Utah, agency founded by Jeff Davis, who launched Orabrush, acquired last year by DenTek. Other Nehemiah brands include P&G castoffs Downy Wrinkle Releaser, Dreft and Kandoo. We end with a holiday note: Kids and adults alike might want to sink their teeth into the North Pole Santa displays at a handful of shopping centers this Christmas. Mall operator General Growth Properties has tapped candy seller It's Sugar to outfit the sections, branded as It'Sugar Winter Escape. The 10-year-old candy brand will fill 2,000 square feet with a host of confectionary delights, like a tree made of candy, 100,000 jelly beans, and a marshmallow snowman. The experience will be limited to five malls in Friendswood, Texas; San Antonio, Texas; Tucson, Ariz.; Newark, Del.; and Pembroke Pines, Fla. The kiosks are meant to provide another reason to draw visitors to brick-and-mortar shopping as malls face foot traffic declines. Contributing: Jack Neff, Jessica Wohl, Adrianne Pasquarelli, E.J.

The next level: UAE graduates' expectations of their first job 05 October, 2016 05 October 2016 It is a tough time to be a fresh university graduate no matter where you live at the moment amid concern about global economic growth and political uncertainty. In the Middle East, the sharp drop in oil prices has led governments and companies to tighten their belts and reconsider hiring plans. Online recruitment firm GulfTalent surveyed 303 recent graduates and final-year students from the American University of Sharjah for insight into how a future generation is feeling and thinking. Carried out in June this year and across a range of academic backgrounds and nationalities, the findings raised a number of interesting conclusions and showed how diverse graduates' expectations are. Read the full report here. Dubai-based airline Emirates Group was deemed the most popular company for fresh university graduates in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), followed by international consumer goods company Unilever, local fashion firm the Chalhoub Group, GE, Nestle, ADNOC, Petrofac, Pwc, Procter & Gamble and Etihad Airways. There was a big difference along gender grounds, with male graduates more attracted by multinationals and technical firms, while female graduates focused more on government organisations and consumer goods firms. Three quarters of UAE nationals were attracted to government entities or companies majority-owned by the government, while 91 percent of their expat rivals preferred multinational companies, such as Unilever, GE or Nestle. Locally owned private firms appear to be less attractive, favoured by only 3 percent of expatriates and 12 percent of Emiratis. So what attracted graduates to specific employers? The survey found the dominant factors cited by the majority of graduates when it came to their preferred employers were finding interesting work, training opportunities and how reputable the company's brand is. While pay scales were not stated as a high criteria by graduates, their expectations on starting salaries varied dramatically. Expatriate graduates on average expect a starting salary of 9,000 dirhams ($2,450) per month. By contrast, the average starting salary expected by an Emirati graduates was 27,000 dirhams, or three times their expatriate rivals. Finally, at the end of the day, despite the differences in perception, a third of Emirati graduates said they had a job lined up, while only one in five of expats said they had a contract signed when they finished their studies. © Copyright Zawya.

If you are a subscriber, simply log in or Subscribe now! This week I want to give you some pointers about saving money in all kinds of ways. There are several kinds of coupons, discounts depending on your age and what you do and other discounts you can buy to help save. You also can combine some coupons, gift cards and discounts to save even more. Coupons It is easy to accumulate manufacturer coupons when you receive the Sunday Herald and News. Red Plum and Smart Source have coupons in the paper weekly — except over major holiday weekends — and Proctor and Gamble provides coupons in the paper once a month. If you need an extra set of coupons, you can stop by the Herald and News and pick up a Sunday paper during the week for a reduced cost. Simply cut out the coupons you will use — or think you might want to try — and sort them by expiration date. Story continues below video × They will all have an expiration date stores strictly adhere to. Match your clipped coupons to store ads and be sure to take them with you when you shop. Also check with the stores you shop at to make sure they accept manufacturer coupons as some of the local discount stores do not. Some manufacturer coupons also are available online and can be loaded to the rewards cards of specific stores, instead of printing and cutting out coupons. Watch advertisements in the paper for store coupons – they are different from manufacturer coupons in that they can only be used at the specific store that the ad is for. Some, but not all, store coupons can be combined with manufacturer coupons, especially for food items. Most store coupons are for extra percentages off certain departments or items in the store. Be sure to read the coupon for details on what the store coupon applies to and the dates it is effective. Rewards Some box stores, or national chain stores, have reward cards where you earn points based on how much or what you buy that can then be used as store credit or cents off your next gasoline purchase. As mentioned above, you can pre-load manufacturer coupons to some stores’ rewards cards as well as free items that are offered and any other specials that may apply to that store at that time. There’s even a rewards card for our local cinemas, and you can earn a free popcorn or even a free movie pass. So be sure to have your rewards card scanned when you make a purchase to get the best bang for your buck. Special discounts At some entertainment places — such as at the movies or bowling — there are discounts for children and seniors, as well as the military. But you will need to ask when or if those discounts apply. Also, check with stores to see if and when they offer senior or military discounts, for either a percentage off, or special pricing. You would be amazed how many of our local stores offer military and senior discounts as well as our restaurants and fast food eateries. Most of them do not publicize the discounts, so you will need to ask. Also check the Herald and News and the Nickel for coupons for certain restaurants that are good for dollars off or percentage off – be sure to check the expiration dates. Smart Source in the Sunday Herald and News sometimes offers restaurant coupons for both in and out of town. Other discounts There are other ways to save even more with coupon books or cards sold locally, generally by students in the schools. The books or cards mostly offer single use two-for-one meals or entertainment. Fundraising groups that have silent or oral auctions have items you can possibly buy at a good deal and the money goes to a good cause. Gift cards are another way to save money either by buying them at a reduced cost on some online sites or buying them at a local store that will then double (or quadruple their value) toward gas purchases saving you more at the pump. So it might be worth it to invest some time in understanding and using coupons to help you stretch your money. And remember, it doesn’t hurt to ask for discounts at the store or restaurant to save even more.

Malco used to be a major aluminium producer, encompassing mining, refining and smelting. Currently, it is only into power generation, reports stated. Separately, media reports suggested that Vedanta expects that Goa will export around 20 million tonnes of iron ore in the current fiscal. Goa produces low grade iron ore which is exported to China.

(© Mark Blinch / Reuters) The close: TSX falls as gold miners, banks weigh Add to ... Reuters Published Monday, Oct. 03, 2016 4:20PM EDT Last updated Monday, Oct. 03, 2016 5:18PM EDT Comments AA Canada’s main stock index fell on Monday, as major gold miners lost ground and heavyweight banks also pulled back as the federal government tightened mortgage and tax rules in a bid to cool the housing market. The most influential stocks weighing on the index included Goldcorp Inc which fell 4.5 per cent to C$20.68 after it temporarily shut down its Peñasquito gold mine in Mexico due to a week-long blockade by a trucking contractor. Barrick Gold Corp, which is dealing with its own forced shutdown of operations at a mine in Argentina, lost 1.9 per cent to C$22.78. The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 1.8 per cent. “Apart from the trials and tribulations of the giant gold companies which are mostly Canadian, the mining companies are experiencing a growing arrival of free cash flows,” said Michael Smedley, chief portfolio manager at Morgan Meighen & Associates. The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index closed down 36.82 points, or 0.25 per cent, at 14,689.04. Seven of the index’s 10 main groups ended in negative territory. The financials group slipped 0.2 per cent, as Ottawa said it will close a tax loophole and introduce a stress test to insured mortgage lending. Investors were also more cautious as Britain set a March deadline to start its withdrawal from the European Union and worries over Deutsche Bank continued to swirl. Royal Bank of Canada fell 0.4 per cent to C$80.95 and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce lost 0.7 per cent to C$101.01. Shares in fashion retailer Aritzia Inc settled at C$17.71 in their market debut, after they were priced at C$16 last week. The energy sector gained 0.6 per cent as Brent settled above $50 a barrel for the first time since August and U.S. crude hit three-month highs, after Iran exhorted the need for other oil producers to join OPEC in supporting the market. Shares in Spectral Medical Inc slumped 85 per cent to 24 Canadian cents after it said its experimental treatment for sepsis – a common, often deadly complication of infection – failed a late-stage study, stymieing the company’s plans to bring to market the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved device for the condition. Wall St dips in slow start to fourth quarter The fourth quarter got off to a weak start for U.S. stock investors on Monday, with financials, consumer staples and utilities pulling the S&P 500 lower. Major indexes have bounced between gains and losses in the past few days, with investors nervous about the outcome of a tight race for the White House ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Big banks extended recent declines as investors worried about the stability of Deutsche Bank and also Wells Fargo & Co’s handling of sales abuses. U.S-listed shares of Deutsche slipped 0.85 per cent as hopes faded of a swift deal with U.S. authorities over a multi-billion dollar penalty for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities. “The feeling is there will be a negotiation lowering that penalty but it’s certainly a bit of an overhang on the overall market,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. The S&P 500 financial index declined 0.43 per cent as Wells Fargo slid 1.02 per cent to its lowest since December 2013. Also weighing on investor sentiment was a plan announced by Britain on Sunday to start its separation from the European Union by March. With yields on U.S. Treasury bonds up following stronger-than-expected U.S. manufacturing data for September, the interest-rate sensitive utility sector fell 1.35 per cent. The consumer staples index declined 0.6 per cent, with Procter & Gamble falling 1.21 per cent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3 per cent to end the session at 18,253.85 points and the S&P 500 lost 0.33 per cent to 2,161.2. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.21 per cent to 5,300.87 points. About 5.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, well below the 7.1 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. S&P 500 companies on average are expected to posts a 0.5 per cent dip in third-quarter earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data. That would mark a fifth straight quarter of year-over-year earnings declines, in large part due to weak oil prices. Tesla Motors jumped 4.74 per cent after the electric carmaker said third-quarter deliveries rose by 70 per cent to 24,500 cars. Cabela’s surged 15.02 per cent after the retailer said it would be acquired by Bass Pro Shops in a deal valued at about $5.5-billion. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.40-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.40-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 77 new highs and 32 new lows.

The group of government, business and academic leaders visited USAP facilities as part of a process to develop a long-term vision to support research in the future. Blue Ribbon Panel Group think tank visits Antarctica to recommend long-term vision for USAP By Peter Rejcek, Antarctic Sun Editor Posted December 30, 2011 Norman Augustine has an idea about how the United States can retain its leadership in an era of increasing global economic competitiveness and budgetary turmoil. It’s a one-two punch philosophy advocated by many in the current administration, including President Barack Obama . “One is to fix our education system and two is greater investment in research,” said Augustine, former chairman and CEO of Lockheed Martin Corp. who has held a slew of government posts over his career, many with a bent toward research and technological development, including chairman of the National Academy of Engineering . It’s that passion for science and technology that has drawn him once again to Antarctica, where he and other government, business and academic leaders spent the first week of December visiting the research facilities and field camps maintained by the National Science Foundation (NSF) , which manages the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) . Augustine gave an interview to The Antarctic Sun during the recent visit to U.S. Antarctic facilities. In 2010, the NSF initiated a comprehensive review of the nation’s research operations on the southernmost continent in collaboration with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) . OSTP advises the White House, while the OMB is the part of the executive branch that implements presidential policy. Photo Credit: Peter Rejcek Members of the Blue Ribbon Panel and NSF officials talk with McMurdo Supply Operations manager Mel Moore, right, about warehousing issues at McMurdo Station. The process started when a committee under the National Research Council was tasked with examining future Antarctic research priorities, which led to a report called Future Science Opportunities in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean . The NRC is part of the National Academies , along with the National Academy of Sciences , National Academy of Engineering and Institute of Medicine . Together the Academies help shape national policies in their respective fields. The NRC committee identified long-term research goals that should guide the USAP in the coming decades, calling for a balance between understanding Antarctica’s role in global climate processes and ensuring an emphasis on discovery and basic research. [See previous article Eye on the future: NRC panel recommends implementing Antarctic observation network.) Now it’s the job of the USAP Blue Ribbon Panel , chaired by Augustine, to wed the future demands of science with a robust and flexible logistics infrastructure. Augustine led a similar review of the USAP in the mid-1990s that helped pave the way for a new $150-million research station at the bottom of the world. “We realize that predicting science is a hazardous business … It often proves to be wrong. The facilities here will long outlast the next generation of science,” noted Augustine while at McMurdo Station where he and a half-dozen members of the panel had spent the previous day visiting buildings, workshops and warehouses. Construction of McMurdo Station began in 1955 during a “golden age” of scientific discovery known as the International Geophysical Year . McMurdo was not originally intended to be a major scientific base in its own right, but to serve as an airfield for planes that would fly to the South Pole to establish a research station there the following year. More than 50 years and dozens of structures later, McMurdo has grown into the largest research station in Antarctica, home to more than 1,100 people during the sun-filled summer months of October through February. At least one building in McMurdo dates back to the late 1950s. Most of the research projects funded by the NSF and other federal science agencies flow through McMurdo, which is the gateway to field camps across the continent and still the launching pad to its more modernized, sister station at the South Pole. Augustine and the rest of the panel had an opportunity to visit the South Pole Station for a day trip. He said it was satisfying to see what had only been a concept 15 years ago turn into reality. “It’s such an improvement over the old station. … What a step forward,” said Augustine, making his fourth trip to the Ice.

They were escorted by National Science Foundation officials Brian Stone and Karl Erb. From left: Stone, Craig Dorman, Bart Gordon, Keith Harrison, Jerry Miller, Gerard Jugie, Duncan McNabb, Erb, Don Hartill and Norm Augustine. But Augustine noted that the panel’s job is to take a holistic approach in analyzing the different pieces of the USAP, which costs about $265 million a year to operate, not including direct research dollars, which accounted for about $70 million in fiscal year 2011. The USAP comprises McMurdo and South Pole, and a third research facility, Palmer Station off the Antarctic Peninsula, focuses on marine and biological research. The Program also operates two research vessels and engages the U.S. military to provide logistical support in the air and on the sea, as well as private companies to operate helicopters and aircraft specifically designed to fly in the polar environment. “They all impact each other; maybe there’s a saving here that will produce a big benefit somewhere else. I think it’s the big picture where there may be a lot of leverage,” Augustine said. The panel got an opportunity to learn about the bits and pieces not just from touring facilities, field camps and airfields, but also directly from the support personnel and science community at McMurdo during an open meeting. A few themes emerged from the comments made by USAP participants : consolidation of warehouses, a centralized recreation center, and an emphasis on alternative energy. “We have an incredible opportunity to do something very different in the way we generate power at this facility,” noted Blue Ribbon Panel member Keith Harrison, a former executive for more than 40 years at Procter & Gamble , a Cincinnati-based, Fortune 500 company, during the meeting. “We’re united in believing that this could be — and should be — a place that could lead the way and be a demonstration site for a totally different way of thinking about power generation,” he added. Photo Credit: Peter Rejcek People ski away from the new South Pole Station, which was built after the last Blue Ribbon Panel review in the 1990s. Augustine repeatedly lauded the workforce charged with managing the warehouses, driving the machinery, cooking the meals, and doing all the other tasks required to run what is basically a small town. “We’ve been impressed with their competence and their ‘can-do’ attitude, particularly with their friendliness and hospitality,” Augustine said. “Everyone we’ve run into has been so helpful.” The panel expects to make its report to the White House and NSF in 2012 after further visits at stateside USAP facilities and Palmer Station. Augustine conceded that the austere budget climate hanging over Washington makes it challenging to expect another project as ambitious as the South Pole Station to emerge in its recommendations. However, he said even difficult economic times don’t necessarily require cuts across the board. An aeronautical engineer, Augustine likened the current economic climate to developing a new airplane that at first is too heavy to fly. Engineers may be forced to redesign or eliminate certain features, but there’s one thing they’ll never cut: “Never did we solve the problem by taking an engine off,” Augustine said. “That’s the message here. … There are ways to reduce weight … but you don’t take the engine off. This place is one of the engines.” Accompanying the panel were Karl Erb, director of the NSF’s Office of Polar Programs ; Brian Stone, director of OPP’s Antarctic Infrastructure and Logistics Division ; and Jerry Miller, assistant director, Ocean Sciences, in OSTP’s  Environment & Energy Division.

While the southern edge of the storm is still in Haiti, affecting the northern part of the country, the 200-strong in-country American Red Cross staff and its Haitian partners are conducting initial damage assessments today to begin emergency response efforts and distributions. IT/Telecommunications equipment is being mobilized to further support overall communication and coordination in country, and emergency relief supplies, including hygiene kits, kitchen kits, and cholera kits are being delivered to vulnerable locations in the north and south. In the United States, the American Red Cross is preparing a large multi-state response to help people in the path of Hurricane Matthew as the storm heads toward the southeast coast. The Red Cross has shelters, more than 500 disaster workers and 90 response vehicles standing by in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. In Florida, the Red Cross is prepared to open or support as many as 100 evacuation shelters and has more than 30 emergency response vehicles standing by. In South Carolina, the Red Cross plans to open or support 19 evacuation shelters today, and dozens of additional shelters are ready to open in Georgia and North Carolina, as needed. The Red Cross has also prepositioned 30 trailer loads of sheltering supplies, ready-to-eat meals as well as clean-up kits and comfort kits containing personal hygiene items. "We're preparing for a large response across several states, opening dozens of shelters to make sure people have a safe place to stay and food to eat as Hurricane Matthew marches northward," said Brad Kieserman, vice president, Disaster Operations and Logistics for the Red Cross. "This is a dangerous storm, the most powerful Atlantic hurricane since Felix in 2007. As the Red Cross gets ready, we urge people who may live in the path of this storm to make their own preparations now. It's critical that coastal residents pay close attention to the forecast and listen to their local authorities, as even a small shift in the storm could have a significant impact." The Red Cross is also working in close collaboration with government officials and community partners to coordinate preparedness activities and potential response efforts. DOWNLOAD EMERGENCY APP  Everyone should download the Red Cross Emergency App to have safety information available on their mobile device, including emergency weather alerts, safety information and shelter locations. Red Cross apps are available in smartphone app stores by searching for the American Red Cross or going to redcross.org/apps. HAVE A DISASTER KIT  Include a gallon of water per person - enough for three days, a three-day supply of non-perishable food, family and emergency contact information, copies of important papers and a map of the area. More details on what to include are available here. HURRICANE SAFETY  People living in the path of the hurricane should listen to local officials and obey any evacuation orders. Other safety steps include: Know your evacuation route. Bring in anything that can be picked up by the wind. Close doors, windows and hurricane shutters. If someone doesn't have shutters, close and board up all windows and doors with plywood. Fill the car's gas tank. Avoid flooded roads and bridges. Turn around, don't drown. PLEASE GIVE BLOOD Hurricane Matthew has already forced the cancellation of about a dozen Red Cross blood drives in South Carolina resulting in approximately 570 donations going uncollected. Dozens more blood drive cancellations are possible along the East Coast depending on the path and impact of the storm. In addition to blood drive cancellations, the Red Cross is also at risk of being unable to collect more than 100 platelet donations if donation centers are forced to close over the next few days. Platelets, a key clotting component of blood often needed by cancer patients, must be transfused within five days of donation and, therefore, are always in demand. The Red Cross has sent additional blood products to areas likely to be impacted by the storm and will send more as needed to ensure patient needs continue to be met. The Red Cross encourages eligible donors in parts of the country unaffected by the storm to please give blood or platelets to help ensure we have a readily available blood supply for patients in need. Even before the threat of Hurricane Matthew, there was an urgent need for donors of all blood types, especially type O. Appointments can be made by using the Red Cross Blood Donor App, visiting redcrossblood.org or calling 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767). MAKE A DONATION The work of the American Red Cross starts long before a hurricane makes landfall in the United States. For example, we have warehouses stocked with disaster relief supplies, thousands of trained workers, and more than 320 mobile response vehicles on standby year-round to be ready to help people in need. If we didn't maintain these resources 24/7, we couldn't get help to people in a timely fashion—but we depend on donations from the American public to be ready. Help people affected by disasters like hurricanes, floods and countless other crises by making a donation to Red Cross Disaster Relief. Your gift enables the Red Cross to prepare for, respond to and help people recover from disasters big and small across the United States. Visit redcross.org, call 1-800-RED CROSS or text the word REDCROSS to 90999 to make a $10 donation. CORPORATIONS HELP   The generous donations from members of the Red Cross Annual Disaster Giving Program (ADGP) and the Disaster Responder Program enable the American Red Cross to prepare communities for disasters big and small, respond whenever and wherever disasters occur and help families during the recovery process.

Glasgow marked the Senator’s second stop on a 650 mile long tour that will undertake in three days. After flying into Malta on Oct. 4 to begin his tour, Glasgow was the second stop out of the 15 planned destinations. The Senator took time to address a crowd of 20 local leaders, business owners, ranchers and members of the press at the event hosted by Farm Equipment Sales. The Senator addressed local concerns on issues as well as national ones. The Senator met with city officials and county commissioners to discuss how he will work with them to solve the sticky situation that has become of our levy south of town. Citing that there were some survey errors made, he aims to work with our local government to help forge a plan to move forward and hold the federal government accountable for their mistakes. Daines went further to state that he wants to make sure we are protected, particularly as far as private property rights and that our concerns over flood insurance rate will be addressed as well. He spoke about a bill he is working on that would give local governments more control over land usage. The common sense bill deals with issues and concerns over such things as our veterans monument, and prevent federal land grabs. Daines spoke about the US beef ban in China, and how the 13-year long ban is looking like it will be finally lifted. The Senator recently went to China with two other members of the senate and two members of congress. Daines cited he has experience with how the Chinese market works, as he had spent five years there while employed by Proctor and Gamble. With the ban lifted he expects to see US beef shipped to China sometime next year. He also took time to address other concerns ranging from free roaming bison, the Affordable Health Care, and water concerns. The Senator will continue his tour with his next stop being in Scobey, followed by Westby, Plentywood and Culbertson on Tuesday. Wednesday tour stops include Sidney, Glendive, Wibaux, Baker. Ekalaka, Broads, and Ashland will be the final three stops on Thursday.

The stunning Saturdays star was a runner up in the final of the BBC One dancing show in 2014. WENN 5 Frankie Bridge would love Len Goodman’s job Speaking exclusively to The Sun Online about who she’d like to get the Strictly judging job, Frankie says: “I think it should be me! “Imagine me sitting there, ‘Oh, you’ve turned your toe in there.’ I don’t know what I’m talking about.” The mum-of-two does know that whoever takes Len’s job when he retires at the end of this series has a big job ahead of them. Frankie says: “I’m devastated Len’s leaving. Getty Images 5 Len revealed he wouldn’t be coming back when this series of Strictly Come Dancing ends “I think whoever fills Len’s boots will have a hard job, they’ll be given a hard time. He’s going to be missed but I don’t blame him. He goes backwards and forwards to America to do the US version and stuff.” Frankie’s former partner, Kevin Clifton, is paired with her friend Louise and she’s been watching the couple avidly since the launch show. BBC 5 Frankie is cheering on her friend Louise and her former Strictly partner Kevin She explains: “Obviously I’m rooting for Kevin and I know Louise as well. “I was part of the ‘you have to do it, you have to do it’ crowd and then they got paired together – it’s perfect me for I still get to cling on.

Peter Andre, Frankie Bridge and Alex Jones support the Do Your Thing campaign for Children In Need “Louise is so good but she’s always really nervous. She’s not overly confident so it’s going to be amazing for her and she’s got the best partner. “Kevin is amazing, even when you think you can’t do something he’ll make it fun. He’s not like a taskmaster but you always get there in the end.” Doug Peters 5 Frankie Bridge opens the salon to celebrate Superdrug’s #FeelSuper campaign, which aims to raise money for the Marie Curie charity Frankie was speaking to The Sun Online at the #FeelSuper Salon Launch to celebrate Superdrug and P&G’s campaign supporting Marie Curie. Until 18 October, at Superdrug each time you buy from selected P&G products including brands such as Olay, Gillette, Oral-B and Max Factor, you’ll trigger a donation to Marie Curie. The cause is something close to Frankie’s heart. She explains: “In the past with the Saturdays we did lot with Marie Curie, I’ve been around the hospitals and met a lot of the nurses and I can see where the money goes. “I’ve known people with terminal illnesses and I’ve known people Marie Curie have helped, it’s the little things that they do. Doug Peters 5 Frankie spent the day with some of the Marie Curie nurses as they launched the pop-up “It’s a hard job, going into someone’s home at that time in people’s lives must be really difficult – I don’t think many people could do what these nurses do. They stay so upbeat and so lovely and they work throughout the night. “Last time we went out to raise £100,000 and we made over £200,000 – that’s the equivalent of 10 nurses for a year. “This year we want to do even better than that!” Harry Redknapp jokes about the Strictly Come Dancing 'curse' with son Got a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk or call us direct on 02077824220 Topics Frankie Bridge Len Goodman Louise Redknapp Strictly Come Dancing Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments Comments Most Read in TV & Showbiz back on Nick Knowles moves back in with estranged wife Jessica Moor TV & Showbiz Pictured no BLURRED tan LINES Emily Ratajkowski goes topless as she pulls her swimsuit down to her waist TV & Showbiz Video EXTREMELY DISTASTEFUL I'm a Celebrity viewers blast hosts Ant and Dec over Stephen Hawking sketch TV & Showbiz Exclusive don't old back, joel Joel Dommett's ex girlfriend backs his I'm A Celebrity flirting with Carol Vorderman - despite their 25… TV & Showbiz Pictured SNOWDON GETS A SOAK Lisa Snowdon strips to bikini and flashes cleavage in I'm A Celebrity shower TV & Showbiz 'we're still in love!'

Sharonville residents honored by Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur 12:18 p.m. EDT October 5, 2016 The Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur presented Sharonville residents Patti and Keith Hanley with their Hearts as Wide as the World Award at their September Friends Appreciation Dinner. (Photo: Provided) The Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur presented Sharonville residents Patti and Keith Hanley with their Hearts as Wide as the World Award at their September Friends Appreciation Dinner. Both Hanleys participate in the Associates Program of the sisters, which is comprised of lay community members who work to further the sisters’ mission of education and service to people who are marginalized. Of particular interest to the Hanleys has been the sisters’ Photovoltaic Learning Lab at their Reading convent. The Learning Lab serves as a prototype for photovoltaic systems in Africa that provide electricity and clean water to the hospitals, clinics and schools where the sisters work. The Lab is staffed by area high school students who test the hardware, generate electricity to purify water, determine cost/benefit ratios for various equipment, etc..., all while simulating African climate conditions. The Hanleys were instrumental in establishing the Learning Lab and continue to serve as advisors for the teachers, students and Sisters of Notre Dame using it. Keith Hanley is a retired engineer from Procter & Gamble. Patti Hanley also works with the Sisters in their efforts to raise awareness in local schools regarding clean water, particularly as it relates to the lives of people in the developing world. Two of the Hanleys four children attended Mount Notre Dame High School, a school established by the sisters. “We honor Keith and Patti because they are truly our friends,” says Sister Mary Ann Barnhorn, the sisters’ director of development. “They are our friends personally and they are our friends, our partners, in the work we do in Cincinnati and around the world.” The Hearts as Wide as the World Award is so named because of the instruction given to the sisters by their foundress more than 200 years ago. “Our charity must not be limited by the love we have for one another,” St. Julie Billiart said. “It must make our hearts as wide as the world.” Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2e2iTSm TOP VIDEOS Joe Deters: "I didn't believe the tears for a second" 2:47 Are deals better on Black Friday or Cyber Monday? 1:00 Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 Predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 Student at UC Tensing forum: 'It's time for war' 0:45 Sam DuBose sister: 'This, to me, is murder' 1:30 Protests in Cincinnati after Ray Tensing mistrial 1:09 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Mistrial declared in Ray Tensing case 3:46 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 Use-of-force expert: 'The actions of Ray Tensing were justified' 0:50

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Oct 5, 2016 at 8:25AM In this segment of the Sept. 22 MarketFoolery podcast, Chris Hill and Bill Barker of Motley Fool Funds discuss whether the market is being too negative about the parent of chains Ann Taylor, Justice, Dress Barn, and Lane Bryant, among others. The whole industry is suffering from macro headwinds, but where do they go from here?   A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Sept. 22, 2016. Chris Hill: Ascena Retail is having a bad week, shares down around 30 percent. This is the parent company of Lane Bryant, Dress Barn, Justice, Catherines, and Maurices. With the exception of Lane Bryant, I believe that all of those retail outlets are showing declining sales, and yet, 30 percent? That seems like a hell of a haircut for this stock. Bill Barker: Yeah. This stock has seen a lot of trouble over the years. It's really not delivered much to shareholders. I guess prior to coming into that -- look retail has been challenging, clothing retail has been challenging. This store has never really delivered to shareholders and so more people found the exit again because of it. The declines were 4 percent at Justice -- this is the same-store sales declines for the quarter -- 4 percent at Justice, 9 percent at Maurice's, 7 percent at Dress Barn, 5 percent at Catherine's. Ann Taylor was going to be around 5 percent, 6 percent. That's pretty thorough, that's pretty across the board. You can say that there are macroeconomic factors, you can say the company is obviously not getting it right when there are declines everywhere to that degree. I would say that- So Maurice's was down the most, 9 percent. That's really not too much of a surprise because it's a sort of a small-town-oriented, Midwest, middle-of-the-country brand. That is where more of the economic problems in the country are right now. Chris: If you're Ascena, do you need to think about, I don't know, getting rid of one of these brands? I don't know. Maybe that's too simplistic, but it seems like they've got a bunch ... We've seen this with other businesses. We've seen this with large conglomerates like Procter & Gamble, Colgate, Palmolive. In those cases you're talking about a business that has 75 to 100 different brands and business lines underneath it and they look to shed some here and there. We've also seen it with a company like Darden Restaurants, which owns Olive Garden and The Capital Grille and that sort of thing, and then got rid of Red Lobster because they just thought, you know what we got to focus here. I'm wondering if at least part of the solution for Ascena Retail Group is to take one or possibly more of these brands and say, you know what, we're going to be a better operator if we're more focused on fewer brands. Bill: I think they probably should consider that. I'm not going to answer as to whether that would definitely be the right thing to do because I don't know. Frankly when you and I discuss women's retail, we're definitionally way over our heads. Chris: Yes. Bill: For us to tackle men's fashion is probably not a fair fight there. Women's is just ... Chris: Right. Bill: Who are these clowns? Chris: Exactly. Bill: That said, they're going the opposite way of what you suggest might be something to think about. They just acquired Ann Taylor. The Ann Taylor numbers, because it hasn't been part of the company for a full year yet, aren't baked into that full company comp decline. They're acquiring, that's what this company historically has done. They have grown by getting more brands, they haven't grown shareholder rewards so maybe it is time to look at hey if you're empire building, great for you. If you're CEO and now your compensation is based on more sales, more employees, whatever, maybe that's only working out for you. Maybe that's not how the CEO's compensation works out, I don't know, but the shareholders are entitled to look at the business plan and say, maybe you're not executing on our behalf.

The Shots app grew to a peak of almost 8 million users, but ultimately it was too difficult to compete with Instagram and Snapchat. Despite a shift to comedy and acquisitions like lo-fi video capture app Camcorder and music video maker Mindie, the Shots team decided they were better off as a content creator. Social media stars from Vine, Instagram and Snapchat befriended the startup. The Bieber affiliation gave it credibility, and co-founder John Shahidi’s “I’m on the creator’s side” stance fostered trust with multi-million view video makers like Lele Pons and Rudy Mancuso. Shahidi discovered that as long as these web celebs kept pumping out funny skits, their fans would follow them from one social media platform to the next. So over the past few months, Shots has rebranded as Shots Studios, and turned its focus from apps to the content people share on them. It’s taken stars who built their fame in still Instagrams, 6-second Vines and off-the-cuff Snapchat clips, and helped them shoot high-production four-minute YouTube videos. The result? Millions of views per video, strong ad revenue and, according to a source close to the company, sudden partnership interest from Facebook, Netflix and Verizon that could potentially spill into acquisition talks. With the help of Shots Studios, former Vine star Lele Pons racks up millions of views on her YouTube videosShots has now signed deals with social stars Lele Pons, Rudy Mancuso and his show Awkward Puppets and Anwar Jabawi. They have exclusive deals with Shots which takes a revenue cut of their earnings that John Shahidi wouldn’t specify but that he called “creator friendly”. In exchange, creators get access to a production team including a film crew, writers, and editors; brand management; sales help; and access to Shots’ data and growth teams. While the startup declined to comment on specific discussions, Shots Studios insists that they are not focused on selling the company right now. Their new business model has been building momentum and the company is a few months away from profitability, due to ads and partnerships with Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola and American Express. Shots will still run its app, but the team is concentrating on video production and distribution.

Advertisers are looking to reach these viewers, particularly in the young demographic that Shots caters to, and video ads pay much more than their annoying banner cousins. If executed correctly, Shots’ plan could ultimately lead to a big exit for the company. Maker Studios was acquired by Disney for more than $500 million. Fullscreen also found a lucrative outcome.  Anything at or above that original $150 million price Twitter dangled would be a big win for Shots’ investors. It has raised $15 million in funding; investors include 500 Startups, Floyd Mayweather and Major League Baseball. And Shots’ most famous investor, Justin Bieber, is more involved than ever. The star got his own start on YouTube and we’re told that he’s very enthusiastic about helping the next generation of artists. And that concept of creating as a team could be Shots’ greatest strength. Each of its affiliated stars do cameos in each others’ videos and cross-promote them to their own fans. That strategy let the Shots family of stars become the oligarchy ruling Vine’s Popular page. Now the startup will give them the spotlight for a lot longer than six seconds. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Shots Studios Founded 2013 Overview Shots Studios is a data-driven entertainment company that creates comedy sketches and music for Millennials.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Oct 5, 2016 at 8:25AM In this segment of the Sept. 22 MarketFoolery podcast, Chris Hill and Bill Barker of Motley Fool Funds discuss whether the market is being too negative about the parent of chains Ann Taylor, Justice, Dress Barn, and Lane Bryant, among others. The whole industry is suffering from macro headwinds, but where do they go from here?   A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Sept. 22, 2016. Chris Hill: Ascena Retail is having a bad week, shares down around 30 percent. This is the parent company of Lane Bryant, Dress Barn, Justice, Catherines, and Maurices. With the exception of Lane Bryant, I believe that all of those retail outlets are showing declining sales, and yet, 30 percent? That seems like a hell of a haircut for this stock. Bill Barker: Yeah. This stock has seen a lot of trouble over the years. It's really not delivered much to shareholders. I guess prior to coming into that -- look retail has been challenging, clothing retail has been challenging. This store has never really delivered to shareholders and so more people found the exit again because of it. The declines were 4 percent at Justice -- this is the same-store sales declines for the quarter -- 4 percent at Justice, 9 percent at Maurice's, 7 percent at Dress Barn, 5 percent at Catherine's. Ann Taylor was going to be around 5 percent, 6 percent. That's pretty thorough, that's pretty across the board. You can say that there are macroeconomic factors, you can say the company is obviously not getting it right when there are declines everywhere to that degree. I would say that- So Maurice's was down the most, 9 percent. That's really not too much of a surprise because it's a sort of a small-town-oriented, Midwest, middle-of-the-country brand. That is where more of the economic problems in the country are right now. Chris: If you're Ascena, do you need to think about, I don't know, getting rid of one of these brands? I don't know. Maybe that's too simplistic, but it seems like they've got a bunch ... We've seen this with other businesses. We've seen this with large conglomerates like Procter & Gamble, Colgate, Palmolive. In those cases you're talking about a business that has 75 to 100 different brands and business lines underneath it and they look to shed some here and there. We've also seen it with a company like Darden Restaurants, which owns Olive Garden and The Capital Grille and that sort of thing, and then got rid of Red Lobster because they just thought, you know what we got to focus here. I'm wondering if at least part of the solution for Ascena Retail Group is to take one or possibly more of these brands and say, you know what, we're going to be a better operator if we're more focused on fewer brands. Bill: I think they probably should consider that. I'm not going to answer as to whether that would definitely be the right thing to do because I don't know. Frankly when you and I discuss women's retail, we're definitionally way over our heads. Chris: Yes. Bill: For us to tackle men's fashion is probably not a fair fight there. Women's is just ... Chris: Right. Bill: Who are these clowns? Chris: Exactly. Bill: That said, they're going the opposite way of what you suggest might be something to think about. They just acquired Ann Taylor. The Ann Taylor numbers, because it hasn't been part of the company for a full year yet, aren't baked into that full company comp decline. They're acquiring, that's what this company historically has done. They have grown by getting more brands, they haven't grown shareholder rewards so maybe it is time to look at hey if you're empire building, great for you. If you're CEO and now your compensation is based on more sales, more employees, whatever, maybe that's only working out for you. Maybe that's not how the CEO's compensation works out, I don't know, but the shareholders are entitled to look at the business plan and say, maybe you're not executing on our behalf.

Nonetheless, the latest above-50 reading was the fifteenth in as many months, highlighting ongoing growth in the country. The headline seasonally adjusted Nikkei India Services Business Activity Index registered 52 in September down from August's 43-month high of 54.7, thus the latest reading pointing to a slower rate of expansion that was moderate overall.

Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised India's growth forecast a tad, citing the resilience of its economy and robust growth momentum. The IMF now expects the economy to expand 7.6% in 2016-17, up from its earlier projection of 7.4%.

The National Memo Smart. Sharp. Funny. Fearless. Friday, November 18, 2016 Submit Tips & Stories Campaign 2016 Politics National World Opinion Money Lifestyle Books Entertainment Health Travel Video   Joe Conason Goodbye, CGI: A Moral Victory For Bill Clinton — And Many Others September 23, 2016 9:24 pm / 83 Comments / Campaign 2016, Editor's Blog, Featured Post, Middle East, Politics, Weekend Reader, White House Tags Bill Clinton Clinton Foundation Clinton Global Initiative Hillary Clinton Joe Conason Judicial Watch Palantir Procter & Gamble Republish Reprint Late on the afternoon of September 21 — almost exactly eleven years after Bill Clinton inaugurated the annual Clinton Global Initiative conferences in New York City — the former president offered closing remarks there for the very last time. Having watched this innovative organization grow from a casual idea into a formidable entity credited for delivering quality health care, clean water, modern education, disaster relief, and other essential benefits to millions of people around the world, he told its members and supporters gathered in a midtown hotel ballroom that âCGI has worked out better than I ever dreamed.â It was understandable and probably wise for Clinton to declare victory this year, after profoundly changing the mindset and practice of modern philanthropy. But even as John Lennonâs âImagineâ filled the room, it was impossible to ignore another aspect of CGIâs conclusion — the angry, exaggerated, and almost entirely inaccurate attacks on CGI from political adversaries of Bill and Hillary Clinton, bristling with accusations of âcorruptionâ and favoritism.â Such shrill assaults were never heard until Hillary Clinton became the favored candidate to succeed Barack Obama in the White House. Over the years since CGI began, in fact, its membership and operations were resolutely non-partisan, with the participation of many Republicans and independents who shared the desire to do some good in the world. Republican businessmen like John Chambers of Cisco Systems joined CGI, provided financial support, and undertook the âcommitments to actionâ that were at the heart of its mission. Republican politicians like John McCain, Mitt Romney, and even Carly Fiorina came to the annual conference and offered high praise for its work. But that was then — and now, with Hillary Clinton as the historic nominee of the Democratic Party, what Republicans once lauded as a font of good works is denounced as a sewer of venality. While scarcely a word of the criticism is true, that doesnât matter as much as the opportunity to smear the Clintons for political advantage. The most illuminating example was a widely-publicized press release that falsely depicted a 2005 CGI âcommitmentâ by Bahrainâs crown prince as a bribe to sway the Secretary of State in 2010. Like so many other slanders surrounding the Clintonsâ philanthropy, that âexposÃ©â from the right-wing claque called Judicial Watch was a clumsy fraud, yet damaged reputations anyway. Both Bill and Hillary Clinton are accustomed to such attacks after a quarter-century under the national spotlight. He has occasionally observed that âpolitics ainât beanbag.â But the vicious attacks on the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative donât only injure those two battle-hardened politicians. The collateral damage includes many decent, hardworking people who have toiled for years on foundation and CGI projects, including thousands of volunteers, whose pride in helping humanity has been turned to ashes by this sustained propaganda campaign. Pouring abuse on people who do hard work to save lives is vile — and as James Carville said recently, âSomebody is going to hell for this.” If there is a just God, Carville is surely right. While the liars and slanderers contemplate eternal damnation, the rest of the American people — and indeed, people around the world — ought to learn something about what the Clinton Foundation and in particular the Clinton Global Initiative have actually achieved during the past decade or so. Much of the story is told, from the beginning, in my new book Man of the World: The Further Endeavors of Bill Clinton, in which I try to apportion credit to at least a few of the many people who have worked with him over the years. Two years ago, on CGIâs tenth anniversary, the data-processing giant Palantir released a study of its commitments that reached some startling conclusions — and that report is very much worth reading on the foundation website. That website provides detailed information on many of the individual commitments undertaken by the nonprofits, corporations, trade unions, and universities that have joined with CGI — such as Procter & Gambleâs massive project that has delivered billions of gallons of potable water to families in the developing world. Not everything tried by CGI members has succeeded, as Clinton and his staff are quick to acknowledge. But as he said at the end, at least they got caught trying to improve the world. They deserve to be thanked and congratulated rather than shamed. That is much more than anyone can say for their mean-spirited and mendacious critics. For those with shorter attention spans, this brief video that preceded Clintonâs final CGI address is uplifting and instructive, if frankly promotional Â — and showcases a few of the individuals who nobly assisted in that organizationâs work.     IMAGE: Former U.S. President Bill Clinton speaks during the Clinton Global Initiative’s annual meeting in New York, September 29, 2015.

QNetNews.ca QNetNews TV 91X FM News The Pioneer QNetNews Interactive QNetNews Trent QNetNews Entertainment Twitter Vimeo Facebook Community Hundreds attend Quinte Career Fair October 6, 2016 at 3:10 pm The Quinte Career Fair was held Thursday at the Quinte Sports and Wellness Centre. Photo by Lindsey Harren, QNet News By Lindsey Harren BELLEVILLE – The Quinte Career Fair attracted a lot of resumés and employers at the Quinte Sports and Wellness Centre Thursday. Roughly 50 employers and employer services were accepting resumés and promoting their companies. Shorelines Casino was one of the busiest employer booths, attracting a steady lineup of people. Karen Poste, manager of economic and strategic initiatives for the City of Belleville, said that the career fair has been going on for over 10 years. Poste said that the fairs coincide with when employers are hiring. “We’ve had a great turnout. We have had about 200 people through the door and we’ve been open for just about two hours,” Poste told QNet News Thursday morning. The career fair is funded by sponsorships along with the cities of Belleville and Quinte West. Rob Frick, employment counsellor with Career Edge in Trenton, said his organization has attended every Quinte Career Fair. “We’re actually one of the three who help host it … along with Community Employment Services and Meta Employment Services,” he said. The career fair is a great way to get employers and job seekers connected in the community, Fricke said. “So far it’s been a fantastic response. There is a lot of great employers here. Helps that the casino is here.” Morgan Foran from Meta Employment Services said: “A lot of people are finding jobs right now.” Dusty Timbbs, also of Meta Employment Services, said the jobs created by Shorelines Casino are something they are helping their clients work towards. Brian Alexander was among the many people looking at the jobs available. He said he was looking for a change after spending a decade drywalling. He hadn’t been to a career fair since he was 16 but was pleased with the turnout Thursday, he said. Louise Hyatt, a human-resources technician with Proctor and Gamble, said she too was pleased with the turnout. “It’s been really busy here today. There was a lineup at the door when we opened here this morning,” said Hyatt. Hers was one of many companies that were encouraging people to submit their resumés online.

Soap and detergent maker Henkel tests products at this facility in Scottsdale. (Photo: John Samora/The Republic) Story Highlights Arizona will lose roughly 375 jobs as soap/detergent maker Henkel moves an operation from Scottsdale The German firm will combine the operation with Sun Products, which it acquired this year The move severs a connection with one of Arizona's hallmark companies, the Dial Corp. The German parent of an Arizona company that makes soaps and detergents plans to consolidate the unit's operations in Connecticut, closing its operations in Scottsdale over the next year and a half. The move will end Arizona's historic connection to Dial soaps. Roughly 375 people work in the Scottsdale office of Henkel AG. Those employees will be offered the chance to relocate, the company said. The German company makes Dial soaps, Persil and Purex laundry detergents, Right Guard antiperspirants, beauty products, adhesives and other items. The Scottsdale office tests products, conducts market research and performs other tasks but doesn't manufacture. Henkel, which employs about 50,000 people worldwide, bought the operation when it acquired Dial Corp. in 2004. An article last year in The Arizona Republic examined the Scottsdale facility and its people in more detail.

The move will start in either the second or third quarters of 2017 and conclude in early 2018. Henkel said the move "represents the next step toward fully integrating Henkel and Sun operations." Sun makes products include Sun and Snuggle. The combination makes Henkel the No. 2 company behind Procter & Gamble in the U.S. laundry business. Relocating to Connecticut brings Henkel's consumer  businesses closer to other company operations in the eastern U.S. and to its North American headquarters in Rocky Hill, Conn. Henkel, headquartered in Dusseldorf, was founded in 1876, and its flagship Persil detergent dates to 1907. Dial soap products evolved in the 1940s in Chicago under meatpacker Armour & Co., as tallow used in soap was a byproduct of meatpacking. A separate entity, bus company Greyhound Corp., bought Armour in 1970 and moved to Phoenix the following year. After the company exited the transportation business in the 1980s, it changed its name to the Dial Corp., in 1991. Five years after that, the company split in two, with Dial and its consumer products going one way and a new corporation, Viad, going another. Viad, which offers marketing/events services and those geared to travel/recreation, remains an independent company still headquartered in Phoenix.

A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Here's a look at longtime Arizona businesses that have closed recently.  The Republic Fullscreen ED DEBEVIC'S: Ed Debevic's was another family favorite, near 20th Street and Highland Avenue. Sassy waitresses served burgers and meatloaf at the retro-style diner through the '80s and '90s. The jukebox, photos and snarky neon signs went to auction when the diner closed in the early 2000s.  Jack Kurtz/The Republic Fullscreen CHOCOLATES BY BERNARD CALLEBAUT: Master chocolatier Bernard Callebaut first brought his exquisite confections to Arizona in 1996, when he opened a store in Scottsdale's Hilton Village. More Valley stores followed. The Chandler store closed in 2004, and the rest of the chocolates began to disappear from Arizona.  Emmanuel Lozano/The Republic Fullscreen SCOTTSDALE 6 DRIVE-IN: This drive-in was demolished in 2014, years after it shut down. It was the latest in a string of drive-in movie theatres to close, the result of changing habits and tastes among movie-goers. The Phoenix area used to be dotted with the outdoor screens. A partial list of names: Big Sky, Pioneer, Nu View and the Thunderbird. One drive-in theater still exists: The WestWind Glendale 9 on 55th Avenue, south of Bethany Home Road.  David Kadlubowski/The Republic Fullscreen VIDEO PARADISE: Video Paradise, at Alma School and Warner roads in Chandler, is from a bygone era, when video stores were a hot weekend stop for people of all ages and the wait for a new release created some buzz. It closed at the end of January 2016 after 25 years, according to the owner.  Chris Coppola Fullscreen MY FLORIST: This bakery, sandwich shop and wine bar was one of the first of the new wave of restaurants in the central Phoenix area when it opened in 1996. It offered a pricey, but delicious, peanut butter sandwich and offered a white wine with which to pair it. The piano performances by Nicole Pesce would delight crowds. It closed suddenly in 2010. More eateries had filed into downtown by then. The iconic sign was left over from when the building did house a florist beginning in 1947. Below it now is a chain hamburger restaurant.  The Republic Fullscreen DOWNTOWN DELI : A longtime fixture in downtown Phoenix, the Downtown Deli shuttered its doors on May 22, 2015. The deli was known for its Skyscraper sandwich with corned beef piled high with pastrami and Swiss cheese. Glenn Schultz, who owned the deli with wife Trish, said the landlord raised the rent, forcing the business to close. But, there's hope. Schultz said they're hoping to relocate the business somewhere else downtown.  Downtown Deli Fullscreen BIG APPLE: Bill Johnson's Big Apple, a 59-year icon at 3757 E. Van Buren St., closed May 24, 2015. The Phoenix restaurant was the last remaining in a chain that once had seven locations. The eatery was known for its Western decor and sawdust on the floor. The waitresses wore cowboy hats on their heads and toy six-shooters on their hips.  Michael Chow/The Republic Fullscreen HARKINS CAMELVIEW 5: After a 42-year run as one of the Valley's preeminent movie theaters, Harkins Camelview 5 in Scottsdale closed in December 2015, replaced by a new 14-screen cinema next door at Scottsdale Fashion Square mall. Harkins announced plans in 2013 to close Camelview, which long ago carved a niche in the Phoenix area as a destination for independent, foreign and artistic films.  The Republic Fullscreen GUEDO'S CANTINA GRILLE: A popular taco shop that operated in downtown Chandler for 30 years closed in December 2015 after being acquired by a firm that plans to bring a new residential and retail development to the site. Guedo's Cantina Grille's longtime owner, William "Guedo'' Samora III, confirmed the property had been acquired by COR Arizona Avenue Company LLC. The developer has been working for several years to bring the new mixed-use development to the corner, which is mostly vacant and includes a parcel of city-owned property that Chandler officials have sought to have developed.  Weldon B. Johnson/The Republic Fullscreen LEGEND CITY: The memories of this amusement park are better than the reality. Envisioned as an Old West theme park, it quickly devolved into a carnival on an asphalt lot. The economic reality was it was too hot for an amusement parks during Phoenix summers and winter evenings didn’t generate enough business.  The Republic Fullscreen A-1 BEER: There was a time when every city had its own breweries, and A-1 was the major player in Phoenix. It was later bought by a larger national brewery and the quality slipped a bit. If you remembered the brand from the 50s, when it was the “Western way to say welcome,” you thought of a crisp pilsner. Those who remember the canned beer from the 70s, have less fond memories.  David Wallace/The Republic Fullscreen BLAKELY'S: Blakely's was a string of service stations through the Phoenix area. Attendants in white uniforms would pump gas, fill up tires and check oil. Patrons were either given a free glass, or a receipt slip that could be saved and redeemed for dinnerware. The glasses, which were painted with cactuses, have become collectibles. The chain started in 1937. It was bought by Gulf Oil in 1963.  The Republic Fullscreen KARSH'S BAKERY: This venerable kosher bakery fell victim to the times. It could not compete with high volume bakeries and increasing rents. It closed in March 2014, ending nearly 50 years in business. On its last day, there were lines around the block. Owners said at the time they hoped to find a smaller, more affordable location and re-open.  Stacie Scott/The Republic Fullscreen HANNY'S: Back when Phoenix residents went downtown to buy clothes, this was one of the department stores of choice. Shopping districts moved to malls and power centers in farther-flung areas. Hanny’s sturdy concrete structure stood vacant for years. The fire department would set it on fire for structure practice. But it has been reinvented and occupied as a wine bar and restaurant since 2008. Patrons can stand over the old elevator shaft. Names of clothing brands still decorate the walls.  Markow Photography Fullscreen CINE CAPRI: Blakely's was a string of service stations through the Phoenix area. Attendants in white uniforms would pump gas, fill up tires and check oil. Patrons were either given a free glass, or a receipt slip that could be saved and redeemed for dinnerware. The glasses, which were painted with cactuses, have become collectibles. The chain started in 1937. It was bought by Gulf Oil in 1963.  The Republic Fullscreen MONTI'S LA CASA VIEJA: Tempe's iconic Monti's La Casa Vieja, among the longest-lasting restaurants in the city and which was housed in the historic Hayden House on Mill Avenue, closed on Nov. 17, 2014, after nearly 60 years in business.  Michael Monti Fullscreen BAKER NURSERY: Baker Nursery opened in 1968. Employees helped landscape countless Phoenix-area homes. And provided a bit of free gardening advice or whimsey with rotating series of signs along 40th Street. In 2006, the namesake signed the business over to his daughters, who closed it in late 2014.  The Republic Fullscreen DOWNTOWN DELI : A longtime fixture in downtown Phoenix, the Downtown Deli shuttered its doors on May 22, 2015. The deli was known for its Skyscraper sandwich with corned beef piled high with pastrami and Swiss cheese. Glenn Schultz, who owned the deli with wife Trish, said the landlord raised the rent, forcing the business to close. But, there's hope. Schultz said they're hoping to relocate the business somewhere else downtown.  Downtown Deli Fullscreen PINNACLE PEAK PATIO: Pinnacle Peak Patio in Scottsdale closed on June 28, 2015. Generations of visitors, hankering for an Old West experience, set foot in the dusty wooden establishment, known for its 2-pound porterhouse steaks and of neckties hanging from the ceiling.  Michael Schennum/The Republic Fullscreen HENKEL AG: Henkel, parent company of the Dial Corp., announced in October 2016 that it was shuttering its Scottsdale, Arizona, offices. The company said it would combine the operation with Sun Products Corp., which Henkel acquired in June 2016. Both companies were planned to move to a facility in Stamford, Conn. Arizona lost roughly 375 jobs. Henkel acquired the Dial Corp., formally one of Arizona's largest corporations, in December 2004 for $2.9 billion.  John Samora/The Republic Fullscreen Like this topic?
