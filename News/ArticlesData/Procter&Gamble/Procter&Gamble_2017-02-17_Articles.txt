Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website one  ×  4  =  Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter The Dow Jones news today focuses on another triple-digit gain after new economic data helped propel stocks higher. Financial stocks led the way on increasing optimism about President Donald Trump's economic agenda and increased expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will proceed with interest rate hikes in the year ahead. Technology giant Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) hit a new high on news that Warren Buffett's investment firm almost quadrupled its stake in the iPhone manufacturer. According to a regulatory filing, Buffett's firm increased its total stake to 57.4 million shares last quarter. Let's look at the numbers from Wednesday for the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq: Dow Jones: 20,611.86; +107.45; +0.52% S&P 500: 2,349.25; +11.67; +0.50% Nasdaq: 5,819.44; +36.87; +0.64% Now, here's a look at today's most important market events and stocks, plus a preview of Thursday's economic calendar. DJIA Today: Dow Rallies as Fed Projects Additional Rate Hikes in 2017 The Dow Jones posted a 107-point gain Wednesday. Shares of Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) offered the biggest boost to the Dow after activist investor Nelson Peltz announced a $3.5 billion stake in the firm. This is the third-largest stake that Peltz's Trian Fund Management has ever taken in a company. Wall Street expects that Peltz will take an active role in helping the company divest its unprofitable brands and attempt to bolster its sales. Don't Miss: Know Exactly What to Buy, What to Sell, and How to Protect Your Money in 2017 Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen appeared before the House and defended the central bank's role in helping the economy recover in the wake of the Great Recession. The Janet Yellen speech today was important because Yellen acknowledged that the U.S. economy remains weak. However, she defended the Federal Reserve's policies and said that they have done more to help the U.S. economy than hinder it. "The economy has recovered more quickly, for example, than … European Union economies have in the aftermath of the crisis," Yellen said during her statement before Congress. "The Federal Reserve has put in place highly accommodative monetary policies meant to spur spending in the economy and restore low unemployment or to achieve the goal of maximizing employment and price stability as assigned to us by Congress." It wasn't just Apple that received a Buffett bump Wednesday. Airline stocks were on the rise on word that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK.A) had boosted its stake in the industry. President Donald Trump welcomed the chief executives of Target Corp. (NYSE: TGT), Best Buy Co. (NYSE: BBY), and six other major domestic retailers. During the meeting at the White House, Trump and the executives discussed corporate tax reform, infrastructure spending, and Trump's plan for a cross-border tax on foreign-made products. According to CNBC, retail executives were highly critical of the border tax proposal and said that such a fiscal policy plan was both "risky and unproven." Related: These Five Steps Can Fix America's Markets in 2017 Crude oil prices were falling in afternoon trading after the Energy Information Administration announced a record build in U.S. crude inventories last week. The government agency reported that domestic crude stocks increased by 9.5 million barrels last week. That figure far outpaced analyst expectations by nearly three times the consensus forecast. The news was enough to offset increased optimism that OPEC members and Russia are on pace to reach their production cut targets in the months ahead. The WTI crude oil price today fell 0.2%. Brent crude dipped nearly 0.4%. While everyone seemed to focus on Janet Yellen's testimony, another big story that was sliding under the radar was happening in Congress. During a House Ways and Means Committee meeting Tuesday, Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-NJ) pushed on with his pressure to have President Trump's tax returns released. In fact, it appears that a war is set to take place on Capitol Hill as Pascrell is demanding at least 10 years of Donald Trump's tax returns. Here's more on the story that could rock Washington in the months to come. Stock Market News and Top Stocks to Watch Today: Feb. 15, 2017 Shares of Groupon Inc. (Nasdaq: GRPN) rallied more than 21% after the company easily topped Wall Street expectations for the fourth quarter. But there's another big reason why Groupon stock is rallying. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE: BABA) announced it has taken a 5.7% stake in the online discount retailer. GRPN stock now up 38.7% year to date. In deal news, shares of Yahoo Inc. (Nasdaq: YHOO) added another 1.5% and touched an intraday 52-week high on news that the company is approaching a revised deal to sell its core assets to Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ). Bloomberg reports the new deal is expected to cut roughly $250 million to $300 million from the original agreement. After the bell, look for additional earnings reports from Cisco Systems Inc.

It was another upbeat day on Wall Street The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 11.67 points, or 0.5%, to 2,349.25. It is the seventh straight gain for the index and its longest winning streak in three and a half years. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 107.45 points, or 0.5%, to 20,611.86. The Nasdaq composite rose 36.87, or 0.6%, to 5,819.44. Seven stocks rose on the New York Stock Exchange for every five that fell. It i s a striking reversal for the market from a year ago, when stocks around the world were tumbling on worries that another recession was on the way. Since then, the economy and job market have continued to improve, along with corporate profits. And the market got a jolt of adrenaline in November, when Donald Trump's surprise White House victory raised hopes for tax cuts and other business-friendly policies from Washington. The S&P 500 is up nearly 26% over the last 12 months, with more than half of the gain coming since Election Day. Such a performance would rank among the best calendar years the index has had in the last three decades. On Wednesday, reports showed that retailers had stronger sales in January than economists expected, and inflation at the consumer level was the highest in years. Consumer prices rose 2.5% in January from a year earlier, the highest rate since March 2012. The data give the Federal Reserve more encouragement to raise interest rates, and economists said the possibility is increasing that it may happen at the central bank's next meeting in March. Fed chair Janet Yellen indicated in evidence before a Congressional committee that the central bank will likely accelerate its pace of increases if the job market remains healthy and inflation keeps climbing. The Fed has raised rates just twice in the last two years, after holding rates at nearly zero from late 2008 to help lift the economy out of the Great Recession. "What really stuck out to me in Yellen's testimony was her adding emphasis to the idea that as things currently stand, even without fiscal stimulus, it would be prudent to hike sooner rather than later," said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management. "So if we do see tax cuts or infrastructure spending, they may need to quicken the pace of rate hikes. The bond market has clearly gotten the message." Treasury yields jumped as investors sold off bonds. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 2.50% from 2.47% late on Tuesday. The 30-year yield rose to 3.08% from 3.06%. When bonds pay more in interest, it can mean less demand from income investors for stocks that pay big dividends. Utility stocks in the S&P 500, which are some of the biggest dividend payers, fell 0.4%. Airline stocks cruised higher after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it added to its investments in several of them. Southwest Airlines rose 1.98 US dollars, or 3.6%, to 57.29 US dollars, United Continental rose 2.01 dollars, or 2.7%, to 75.75 dollars, Delta Air Lines rose 1.31 dollars, or 2.6%, to 51.17 dollars and American Airlines rose 97 cents, or 2.1%, to 47.54 dollars. Procter & Gamble rose 3.26 dollars, or 3.7%, to 91.12 dollars after activist investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management disclosed in a regulatory filing that it owns a stake in the company. American International Group sank to the biggest loss in the S&P 500 after reporting a larger operating loss for the fourth quarter than analysts expected. It fell 6.04 dollars, or 9%, to 60.85 dollars. Fossil Group plunged 3.39 dollars, or 14.8%, to 19.48 dollars. The watch and accessories company gave a profit forecast for 2017 that fell well short of analysts' predictions, and it said it may lose money. In Europe, the German Dax index rose 0.2%, while the French CAC 40 rose 0.6% and the UK's FTSE 100 added 0.5%. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 1%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.2% and the Kospi in South Korea gained 0.4%. The dollar ticked up to 114.26 Japanese yen from 114.22 yen late Tuesday. The euro rose to 1.0591 from 1.0572 dollars, and the British pound dipped to 1.2445 from 1.2465 dollars. Benchmark US crude fell nine cents to settle at 53.11 dollars a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 22 cents to 55.75 dollars a barrel in London. Natural gas rose two cents to 2.93 dollars per 1,000 cubic feet, heating oil fell a fraction of a penny to 1.63 dollars per gallon and wholesale gasoline was virtually flat at 1.55 dollars per gallon. Gold rose 7.70 dollars to 1,233.10 dollars per ounce, silver rose seven cents to 17.96 dollars per ounce and copper was virtually flat at 2.74 dollars per pound.

The “Bubbles and Bathrobes” themed party was attended by actress, singer and producer Ashley Tisdale and featured world-famous DJ A-Trak. Held at the entertainment landmark Hollywood & Highland Center in Los Angeles, the party welcomed attendees at 6 A.M. with a yoga session attended by Ashley Tisdale, an interactive pop-up shower with performance artists, and a two-hour dance party featuring A-Trak. Attendees were inspired to change-up their morning routine; from enthusiastically greeting the sun (rather than sleeping in) to embracing a new way to shower. Brand ambassadors were onsite to give guests a #ShowerDUOver through product demos and samples of the Olay, Old Spice and Ivory DUOs. “Beauty has always been a passion of mine. I had the chance to check out Olay DUO before it hit shelves, and it totally changed my shower routine, for the better, so I’m excited I can finally tell my fans about it! And what a better way than at an event that challenges the way people think about their morning?” said Ashley Tisdale, adding, “I’ve been focusing a lot on reinvention, especially when it comes to health and wellness all of which start first thing in the morning for me.” “DUO is on a mission to reinvent the morning and we love that — that’s what Daybreaker and our community is all about,” said Daybreaker co-founder and CEO Radha Agrawal. “We looked to create unexpected moments that would highlight the uniqueness of DUO while staying true to the Daybreaker experience. With the “Bubbles and Bathrobes” theme, we told a reimagined story that had people walking away feeling their morning was totally reinvented.” About DUO Consumers can go to cleansingduos.com for more information on the DUO.
