The Kingdom is the tenth largest country in the world by GDP per capita and it has become, according to the World Bank, the ‘strongest Arab economy’ in the world. Today there is a main focus that looks beyond what brought our main source of economic growth, namely oil and gas, to promote a more diversified economy. The government’s strategic vision is to create an economy that supports and fosters private sector entrepreneurial spirit, one that encourages innovation and provides employment for hundreds of thousands of Saudi youths. There has been a lot of talk about economic diversification, as well as transforming Saudi Arabia into a hub for businesses across the globe. I wanted to share a different story, that of my own company. Through our partnership with the Abu Dawood family, Procter & Gamble has been present in Saudi Arabia for over sixty years. During that time, we have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in establishing two state-of-the-art manufacturing plants. Where we have hired thousands of men and women, the majority of them Saudi nationals. The Kingdom has long been a manufacturing hub for Procter & Gamble; we export brands such as Always, Ariel, Downy, Fairy, Head & Shoulders, Pampers, Pantene and Tide to over twenty countries in two continents. Our operations in Dammam, Jeddah and Riyadh are key to our growth across a wider region. The question I am often asked is, ‘Why Saudi?’ My response is always the same. Saudi Arabia has offered and continues to offer Procter & Gamble the foremost location in the region for manufacturing. There is ample space to build manufacturing facilities, which is supported by the Saudi Industrial Property Authority’s integrated infrastructure and services. Our two production facilities are cutting-edge; we have hosted visits from our colleagues in countries as far off as Japan who have sought to learn how we manufacturer in Saudi at such high levels of efficiency. There is the cost of production; energy and water rates are amongst the most competitive in the world. This will change as subsidies are removed and we are doing our part to conserve resources, leverage renewable energy to power our facilities, and ensure that we have no waste going to landfill. On top of that, the Kingdom has a world-class, diversified transportation infrastructure which means that our supply chain operates efficiently, both inbound and outbound. Furthermore, I would like to share the most important differentiator to Procter & Gamble when it comes to our operations in Saudi, which is the people. I am proud of the remarkable talent that we have in this country, especially among the youth. We employ approximately 900 people directly at our sites in the country, of whom 70% are Saudi nationals. We have employed tens of thousands more during the company’s history. Many of P&G’s Saudi employees work outside of the country, in locations as near as Dubai and as far as our HQ in Cincinnati and Geneva. They have proved time and time again that there is no obstacle or challenge that they cannot overcome. When I look at Saudi Arabia, I see potential. I know that my company feels the same. For these reasons and many more, Saudi will remain P&G’s manufacturing location of choice. I have many hopes for the future of my country and welcome other multinationals to learn from our experience as they grow their presence in the region.   TAGS Gas Oil P&G Saudi national SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleCampaign to collect used textbooks launched Next articleMaharaj bowls S.

He knew he wanted to build a well-known Canadian brand that turned a profit. Moreover, he wanted the freedom to shift direction as he pleased, to let his instincts guide his evolving pursuits. One may wonder, then, what Couture saw in a little-known two-person trinket shop called Artika. But he definitely saw something. And his hunch—that Artika could be both a profitable commercial success and a personally fulfilling entrepreneurial venture—proved correct. The business has transformed immensely since Couture and his partner (in business and in life), Isabelle Laforce, bought it in 2007. Since then, the couple has taken Artika from a modest-sized manufacturer of trendy desk lamps and candles to a tech company that sells consumer-friendly smart-home devices around the world. Its Smartika line, currently comprising predominantly indoor and outdoor lighting fixtures, are connected to the Internet and can be programmed and controlled using smartphones or voice commands. This nascent Internet of Things (IoT) portfolio represents Artika’s shift from a commoditized business to an innovation factory: the firm grew its sales by more than 1,000% from 2010 to 2015, and now sells more than 1.4 million products annually. In fact, the company’s hunger for boundary-pushing growth is what helped it earn a spot on this year’s list of Canada’s Best Managed Companies. “We always had big goals,” says Couture. “I don’t think we envisioned [growth] would take this form, but we certainly wanted to do better.” Artika for Living electronic component. (Richmond Lam) Artika’s evolution is the result of an ongoing cycle of contemplation, revelation and adjustment. In the beginning, Couture’s growth strategy for the business involved a type of reverse engineering. Instead of creating products and then finding customers willing to buy them, he approached large distributors—leveraging connections he’d made at P&G—and simply asked what they were looking for. This approach produced a plan to design household appliances and fixtures, like lighting, floor tiles and plumbing parts—all devised at Artika’s Dorval, Que., headquarters and manufactured overseas. A year after Couture and Laforce bought the business, Artika’s products were being offered across Canada and the U.S. at such retailers as Costco, Home Depot and Lowe’s. Within a few years, Artika was selling more than one million products per year to buyers in 13 countries. The company was growing and prospering, but Couture wanted more for it. By 2013, he started to think the opportunity might be in the IoT. It’s now clear smart-home devices are having a moment. Nearly every gadget or appliance—from refrigerators to door locks to shower heads—can be connected to the Internet and controlled by a hand gesture or vocal cue. Companies have been disparately working toward a Jetsons-style home for years, and their efforts are starting to take hold in the mainstream. Technology research firm Gartner predicts that by 2022, a typical family home will contain at least 500 smart devices, with overall adoption increasing 30-fold from 2009 to 2020. “There are no other markets I can see that are growing that fast,” says Couture. That was less clear four years ago, but Couture had faith in his hunch. To start, he needed both people and funds—futuristic home doodads don’t invent themselves—so he secured $12.5 million in subordinated debt financing from the Business Development Bank of Canada and Quebec’s Fonds de solidarité FTQ, with flexible five-year payment terms (the latter a reward for years of solid financial management). “This allowed us to invest heavily in R&D without worrying too much about the short-term reimbursement,” says Couture. With no tech background himself, Couture hired an outside firm to help staff a new skunkworks, which took the name Smartika. Couture’s self-described “fanatical” approach to hiring means he will leave a position vacant for months if he can’t find someone who fits, both culturally and professionally. It is an exhaustive process that often goes beyond Canada’s borders (one-third of recruits come from abroad), but it results in a highly engaged staff with an oversized output. Couture reports that each one of his 85 employees does work that contributes to a million dollars in annual sales. If Artika’s people are the business’s foundation, the systematic way in which the company conceives and follows through on new ideas is the scaffolding that guides its progress. Artika’s formalized five-step innovation process, dubbed Stage Gate, is meant to transform notions on napkins to products on store shelves. The process is ongoing, kicking off every two weeks with a pitch meeting. If the an idea appears promising to the team, its creator drafts a business proposal outlining a budget and timeline. From there, a team is assembled and resources gathered to pursue the idea. The company ponies up for the equipment needed to make it a reality, and then, finally, mass production begins. “I think this [structure] makes innovation a lot easier and limits risk in a streamlined way,” says Couture. It also helps nurture a culture in which taking risks is encouraged and rewarded (folks who deliver on bold ideas get generous bonuses). As a tech outsider, Couture plays a key role in the R&D process, too. “Even though I don’t understand all the technical aspects of what we build, I try to focus on the user experience,” he says. Not long ago, Couture took home an in-development Smartika outdoor light to install himself. He found the two-part assembly process was needlessly complex, as was the system for connecting the device to his smartphone. He brought his notes back to the Smartika team, who then simplified both procedures. That’s not just meddling on Couture’s part: He believes creating a seamless user experience is a crucial competitive differentiator. “[Couture’s] vision is to democratize this space,” says Anne-Marie Sicard, a partner with Deloitte’s audit and advisory services who coached Artika in its pursuit of the Best Managed designation. “He wants his grandma to be able to buy and connect the device.” As Artika achieves that aim, Sicard says the challenge will be keeping momentum going, noting that until now, efforts to claim its share of an emerging market have meant executing ideas quickly often trumped big-picture planning. But as Artika grows, Couture’s vision is crystallizing. In the next five years, the company aims to integrate the entire 300-product Artika line into the Smartika catalogue. It’s an ambitious goal, but he believes Artika’s early-adopter positioning and finely calibrated culture of innovation will allow it to lead in a white-hot sector. “We already have a product line and large distribution channels,” says Couture. “I think we’ll be able to grow this IoT thing faster than anyone else.” Like Us Follow @cdnbiz Subscribe with Texture Get our daily briefing on innovation, leadership, technology & the economy.

Maybe only for business but employees are nothing for them. Poor leadership, high turnover. Each employee is afraid about when is the their turn to be fired.

Read more about the partnership here. Answer from Aaron Yip, software engineer: With the turn of the 1900s, Germany was perfectly poised to become the greatest superpower in written history, one of the most industrialized nations at the time (next to UK and Argentina) paired with the biggest military for the following 50 years. Trending: Pep Guardiola’s Bizarre Claim After Liverpool Draw The German empire and territories would soon give birth to an overwhelming portion of future Nobel Laureates and many of the greatest minds of the 20th century including Max Born, Hans Bethe, Alexander Grothendieck, Bernard Katz, Henry Kissinger, Madeleine Albright, Walter Kohn, Hans Adolf Krebs, Charles Proteus Steinmetz, and Albert Einstein. All of these people would be forced to flee the German empire. Where did they go? Well… The United States is universally renowned for its universities and industry giants today like Apple, Google, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, Dropbox and Uber; as well as Sun Microsystems, Intel, Yahoo!, IBM all the way to Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, AT&T, Goldman Sachs, eBay, United States Steel, Ford, and General Electric. Albert Einstein, fleeing Germany, would find refuge at Princeton and change the world forever in many ways. On the eve of World War II, he penned a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt which would establish the Manhattan Project. There, future Nobel Laureates Hans Bethe and Enrico Fermi, refugees from Italy, ran the labs that invented the atomic bomb to end WW2 for the United States.

Reuters Nobel Laureates With Immigrant Roots Abdul Fattah Jandali is a political migrant from Homs, a city now destroyed by the Syrian civil war. Jandali started university at the American University of Beirut, but protests ultimately forced him to flee Lebanon. He finished his degree at Colombia University in the U.S. and continued with an economics PhD at Wisconsin University. There he met and dated Joanne Carol Schieble, a German-Swiss Catholic. She became pregnant, and they placed their child for adoption in San Francisco. The couple that adopted their baby named him Steve Jobs. In the late 1960s, Michael and Eugenia Brin left the USSR to escape anti-Semitism with their son. Michael Brin became a professor at the University of Maryland, and Eugenia Brin became a research scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Their son, Sergey Brin, received a NSF fellowship that took him to Stanford University. He met Larry Page; the duo became fast friends and transformed information technology. Google was born with an investment of $100,000 by Stanford alum and Sun Microsystems co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim, a German immigrant. Don't miss: The Divide at the Heart of the White House Spells Disaster Steve Chen, born in Taiwan, founded YouTube. Jan Koum from Ukraine founded WhatsApp. Brazilian Mike Krieger founded Instagram. Arash Ferdowsi, Dropbox founder, is an Iranian-American. Travis Kalanick, Uber founder, was born to Polish and Russian Jewish immigrants. Andrew Grove, born in Hungary, founded Intel. Jerry Yang from Taiwan founded Yahoo, Herman Hollerith from Germany founded IBM and Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart from Germany founded Pfizer. AT&T? Alexander Graham Bell from Scotland; P&G? William Procter from England and James Gamble from Ireland; Goldman Sachs? Marcus Goldman from Germany. Pierre Omidyar, France, founded eBay. Scottish American Andrew Carnegie founded US Steel as well as Carnegie Mellon University. Irishman William Ford and Mary Ford, daughter to Belgian immigrants, raised Henry Ford who in turn founded the Industrial Revolution, automobiles, and the Ford Motor Company. General Electric's Thomas Edison was born to a Canadian father. Walt Disney, Amazon, Boeing, Citigroup, Kroger, Costco, Home Depot, Walgreen, State Farm Insurance, Lockheed Martin, Oracle, McDonalds — the list goes on and on and on. Read More Fortune 500 Companies With Immigrant Roots These companies employ more than 19 million people globally with combined revenues of $4.8 trillion (2014) for the United States. This figure exceeds the GDP of every country in the world except the U.S., China, and Japan. Immigrants are twice as likely to start a new business than non-immigrants. Seven of the 10 most valuable brands in the world come from American companies founded by immigrants or children of immigrants. A Luo boy was born on the shores of Lake Victoria outside Kendu Bay, British Kenya in 1936. As he grew up, he traveled widely — visiting Europe, India and Zanzibar — and became a cook for missionaries and a local herbalist in Nairobi. In 1960, he attended the University of Hawaii where he met and dated Stanley Ann Dunham, an American woman. Their son, Barack Obama, would become the seventh US president with immigrant parents—a lineage that includes Thomas Jefferson. Stanford Professor Maryam Mirzakhani was born in Iran in 1977. Twenty-two years later, she started her PhD at Harvard University.

Reuters Most popular: Poll: Half of Canadians Want Asylum Seekers Who Illegally Cross U.S. Border Deported South African Elon Musk builds on the Martian dream with his work at SpaceX. In his biography, answering why he choose to move to the U.S., Musk says, "The United States is definitely ahead in culture of innovation. If someone wants to accomplish great things, there is no better place than the U.S.” This is absolutely correct. But let us imagine a slightly different world. A world where Maryam Mirzakhani and Pardis Sabeti are Canadian Professors; where Apple and Google are Canadian companies; where Carnegie Mellon University and the Industrial Revolution were founded in Canada; and so were YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, Dropbox, Uber, Sun Microsystems, Intel, Yahoo!, IBM, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, AT&T, Goldman Sachs, eBay, Boeing, Citigroup, Kroger, Costco, Home Depot, Walgreen, State Farm Insurance, Lockheed Martin, Walt Disney, Oracle, Amazon, McDonalds, and innumerable other companies. Imagine Satya Nadella, Sundar Pichai, and Vinod Khosla running Canadian internet giants. For our entire history, our country has been defined by welcoming when other nations oppressed. The most American thing is unconditional love — love that ended wars; love that helped build everything from YouTube and Instagram to McDonalds and Disney; love that uncovered new laws of physics, advanced the frontiers of space, and saved countless millions of lives on earth. The most American thing ever is exclaiming boldly and unyieldingly, "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free; the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me.” Those were the greatest minds of the last century who came and helped transform America into the global center of innovation from technology and politics to sciences and the arts.

Read more about the partnership here. Answer from Aaron Yip, software engineer: With the turn of the 1900s, Germany was perfectly poised to become the greatest superpower in written history, one of the most industrialized nations at the time (next to UK and Argentina) paired with the biggest military for the following 50 years. The German empire and territories would soon give birth to an overwhelming portion of future Nobel Laureates and many of the greatest minds of the 20th century including Max Born, Hans Bethe, Alexander Grothendieck, Bernard Katz, Henry Kissinger, Madeleine Albright, Walter Kohn, Hans Adolf Krebs, Charles Proteus Steinmetz, and Albert Einstein. All of these people would be forced to flee the German empire. Where did they go? Well… The United States is universally renowned for its universities and industry giants today like Apple, Google, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, Dropbox and Uber; as well as Sun Microsystems, Intel, Yahoo!, IBM all the way to Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, AT&T, Goldman Sachs, eBay, United States Steel, Ford, and General Electric. Albert Einstein, fleeing Germany, would find refuge at Princeton and change the world forever in many ways. On the eve of World War II, he penned a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt which would establish the Manhattan Project. There, future Nobel Laureates Hans Bethe and Enrico Fermi, refugees from Italy, ran the labs that invented the atomic bomb to end WW2 for the United States. Picture shows a German 55 euro cents special edition stamp commemorating the the 100th anniversary of the publication of late German-born physicist Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity in Berlin June 15, 2005. Reuters Nobel Laureates With Immigrant Roots Abdul Fattah Jandali is a political migrant from Homs, a city now destroyed by the Syrian civil war. Jandali started university at the American University of Beirut, but protests ultimately forced him to flee Lebanon. He finished his degree at Colombia University in the U.S. and continued with an economics PhD at Wisconsin University. There he met and dated Joanne Carol Schieble, a German-Swiss Catholic. She became pregnant, and they placed their child for adoption in San Francisco. The couple that adopted their baby named him Steve Jobs. In the late 1960s, Michael and Eugenia Brin left the USSR to escape anti-Semitism with their son. Michael Brin became a professor at the University of Maryland, and Eugenia Brin became a research scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Their son, Sergey Brin, received a NSF fellowship that took him to Stanford University. He met Larry Page; the duo became fast friends and transformed information technology. Google was born with an investment of $100,000 by Stanford alum and Sun Microsystems co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim, a German immigrant. Steve Chen, born in Taiwan, founded YouTube. Jan Koum from Ukraine founded WhatsApp. Brazilian Mike Krieger founded Instagram. Arash Ferdowsi, Dropbox founder, is an Iranian-American. Travis Kalanick, Uber founder, was born to Polish and Russian Jewish immigrants. Andrew Grove, born in Hungary, founded Intel. Jerry Yang from Taiwan founded Yahoo, Herman Hollerith from Germany founded IBM and Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart from Germany founded Pfizer. AT&T? Alexander Graham Bell from Scotland; P&G? William Procter from England and James Gamble from Ireland; Goldman Sachs? Marcus Goldman from Germany. Pierre Omidyar, France, founded eBay. Scottish American Andrew Carnegie founded US Steel as well as Carnegie Mellon University. Irishman William Ford and Mary Ford, daughter to Belgian immigrants, raised Henry Ford who in turn founded the Industrial Revolution, automobiles, and the Ford Motor Company. General Electric's Thomas Edison was born to a Canadian father. Walt Disney, Amazon, Boeing, Citigroup, Kroger, Costco, Home Depot, Walgreen, State Farm Insurance, Lockheed Martin, Oracle, McDonalds — the list goes on and on and on. Fortune 500 Companies With Immigrant Roots These companies employ more than 19 million people globally with combined revenues of $4.8 trillion (2014) for the United States. This figure exceeds the GDP of every country in the world except the U.S., China, and Japan. Immigrants are twice as likely to start a new business than non-immigrants. Seven of the 10 most valuable brands in the world come from American companies founded by immigrants or children of immigrants. A Luo boy was born on the shores of Lake Victoria outside Kendu Bay, British Kenya in 1936. As he grew up, he traveled widely — visiting Europe, India and Zanzibar — and became a cook for missionaries and a local herbalist in Nairobi. In 1960, he attended the University of Hawaii where he met and dated Stanley Ann Dunham, an American woman. Their son, Barack Obama, would become the seventh US president with immigrant parents—a lineage that includes Thomas Jefferson. Stanford Professor Maryam Mirzakhani was born in Iran in 1977. Twenty-two years later, she started her PhD at Harvard University. At 37, she became the first woman to win the Fields Medal—the highest honor in mathematics—putting her in a very small circle that includes Terence Tao, an Australian-American mathematician. Harvard Professor Pardis Sabeti was born in Iran in 1975 and left before the Iranian Revolution.

A survey of 102 companies, including Nestle SA and Procter & Gamble Co., found that 180,000 products were reformulated in 2016, according to a report from the Consumer Goods Forum. That was about double the previous year. “The big consumer companies are responding to competitive pressures,” Peter Freedman, managing director of the industry body, said by phone. “The growth in the industry is coming from small startups with product portfolios that have a healthier angle.” The biggest producers are losing share to smaller, localized brands that are capitalizing on shoppers’ growing preference for healthier and more sustainable products. Organic growth for global consumer companies has fallen to less than 3 percent for the last three years, according to Credit Suisse analysts. Adding to changing consumer tastes, governments are clamping down on unhealthy products. In March, the U.K. followed Mexico in imposing a tax on sugary drinks in an effort to cut obesity. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last year announced companies would be required to label products with more detailed information about their sugar content. After failing to meet internal goals, Nestle says it has found a way to reduce sugar in chocolate by as much as 40 percent and will cut the amount of sugar in the chocolate and confectionery it sells in the U.K. and Ireland by 10 percent by next year. Mars said 99 percent of its products now contain less than 250 calories per serving. “The forces of the market are pushing things in the right direction, and there will be more to come,” Freedman said. “Products will have less salt, less sugar and fewer calories.” Tags Consumer Goods Commerce Economics Salt Shopper Product Sugar Maker Consumer Portfolio Recommended for you Race photos Click here for photos Follow Live Well Nebraska More events Health and fitness events Mar 22 Adult Alcohol & Drug Evaluations Wed, Mar 22, 2017 @ 9:00 am Serenity Matters Counseling Mar 23 Breathe and Brew Spring Yoga Series Thu, Mar 23, 2017 @ 6:30 pm Lucky Bucket Brewery Mar 28 Simple Fix Freezer Meal Preparation Workshop Tue, Mar 28, 2017 @ 5:30 pm Hy-Vee Mar 29 Adult Alcohol & Drug Evaluations Wed, Mar 29, 2017 @ 9:00 am Serenity Matters Counseling Mar 30 Who Leads, Who Follows: Feeding and Physical Activity Division of Responsibility in Childcare Thu, Mar 30, 2017 @ 6:30 pm ISU Extension and Outreach, West Pottawattamie Live Well Nebraska Magazine 'It's never too late to get started': Omaha woman becomes professional bodybuilder at 46 “I wouldn’t say I’m obsessive about anything.

(Brett Le Blanc/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @bleblancphoto BIRD-WATCHING TOOLS Binoculars or camera Binoculars are the go-to tool of most bird watchers, including nearly all those on Saturday's early-morning walk. Some use cameras with long-range lenses. Spotting scope Doug Chang, the guide for the Wetland Park walk, uses a Swarovski spotting scope to focus in on birds out in the field. Traditionally used for hunting, the spotting scope sits on a tripod and has a powerful lens allowing viewers to see birds in greater detail than by using binoculars. Bird-watching guide or app Chang uses the "Sibley Birds West: Field Guide to Birds of Western North America," but he recommends any guide published by the Audobon Society or National Geographic. He also uses the book's auxiliary smartphone app, which allows him to hear the bird's call. By BROOKE WANSER LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL Just after sunrise Saturday, bird enthusiasts gathered to celebrate International Migratory Bird Day by wandering through Clark County Wetlands Park, hoping to catch a glimpse of birds passing through. Crystal Alura Jackson, a program specialist at the park, said around 600 schools, parks, zoos and museums in the Americas create events to celebrate the day, which is the main program of Environment for the Americas. This year’s theme was “Stopover Sites: Helping Birds Along the Way.” “For Southern Nevada that’s quite important,” Jackson said.“Water is scarce here, so it’s important to have a habitat for migratory birds that keep going and for those that rest here and nest.” Wetlands Park is a major stopover site for hundreds of species of birds traveling the north-south Pacific Flyway that extends from Alaska to Patagonia, organizers said. Jackson said the approximately 30 people participating in the morning’s two-hour walk through the nature preserve were likely to be “die-hard enthusiasts.” Birds trilled in the cool morning air as David Walker shot a photo of a black phoebe. Walker, whose wife Jody works at the Wetlands Park, became interested in bird watching through her work about two years ago. “For me, it’s more about photography,” said Walker, who posts wildlife photos on his blog, naturallyvegas.com. The hobby began when his wife gave him a book, which is a bucket list of birds. “My goal is to take a good picture of a male and a female,” Walker said. The group’s largest bird sighting was just above the preserve’s Big Bridge as guide Doug Chang pointed out cinnamon teal and blue-winged teal ducks and a great-tailed grackle. Chang, who is president of the Red Rock Audubon Society, said he became involved in wildlife after retiring from Proctor & Gamble and moving to Las Vegas five years ago. “Bird-watching is just something that requires some studying, and for people to get out in nature,” Chang said. “Both of those are things that I like to do.” He’s taken many trips and read many books and articles about birds, but he said the bulk of his knowledge has come from being wrong. “You go out and say, ‘Oh, that’s a duck!’ And it’s really not a duck, and somebody corrects you,” Chang said, laughing.
