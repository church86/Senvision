Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Sep 9, 2016 at 3:48PM With dozens of billion-dollar consumer brands between them, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) engage in their most fierce rivalry on the baby care aisle. The Pampers brand, which is P&G's biggest franchise, fights year after year against Kimberly-Clark's Huggies for the global market share lead. Procter & Gamble is on the winning side of that battle lately, yet the company as a whole is growing at a much slower pace than its key competitor. But which stock would make a better buy for investors right now? Let's take a closer look. Comparison metrics Metric P&G Kimberly-Clark Market cap $232 billion $45 billion Sales growth 1% 5% Profit margin 16% 11% Dividend yield 3% 2.9% Forward P/E 21 19 Sales growth excludes acquisitions and divestments and is on a constant currency basis for the past complete fiscal year. Data sources: Company financial filings and S&P Global Market Intelligence. Operating trends  Kimberly-Clark has its larger rival beat in the key operating metric of organic growth. Since it strips out the effects of foreign currency swings and brand divestments, this one figure best captures overall demand. The matchup isn't even close. P&G's organic growth fell for the second straight year to just 1%. Kimberly-Clark's expansion pace is down, too, but has been a much healthier 5% lately. Look beyond that headline number and the picture tilts even further in Kimberly-Clark's direction: Sales volume has been steadily positive for the company even as Procter & Gamble's volumes have declined. P&G managed a slight turnaround on this front last quarter, but has yet to produce the string of volume gains that would suggest a broad growth rebound. On the other hand, P&G is proving more adept at wringing efficiency gains out of its business. Costs are down sharply over the last two years, and management has identified billions of additional cuts that it aims to employ through fiscal 2018. PG Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts. As a result, it enjoys consistently higher profitability. That gap is likely to increase in the coming years, given that P&G has sold off many of its slower growing, less profitable brands. Cash returns Direct cash returns make up a large part of a shareholder's total return with stocks like these, since companies that produce consumer staples tend to generate predictable profit streams in good times and bad. Here, the matchup is a bit mixed. Kimberly-Clark has shown a stronger penchant for dividend hikes, while P&G prefers to focus on stock buybacks. P&G's recent dividend news has been disappointing for income investors. The payout improved by just 1% last year and by 3% the year before, which in each case was the lowest raise in well over a decade. P&G's annual dividend raise since 2003. Data source: P&G financial filings. Buoyed by its faster growth pace, Kimberly-Clark delivered 5% dividend raises in each of the last two fiscal years. On the other hand, P&G is spending a mountain of cash on buying back its own stock. The company is on pace to send $70 billion back to shareholders -- mostly through buybacks -- over the next few years. That represents an incredible 30% of its current market capitalization, and is only possible because the company is selling off big chunks of itself, including through divesting its Duracell battery business and its Coty beauty line. Kimberly-Clark's clearer path However, cost cuts and brand divestments can't offset sluggish growth forever. Thus, a P&G investment only makes sense if you believe the company will engineer a pivot back to market-beating growth after over two years of underperforming. The payoff would be significant in this case, as sales growth and profit gains would likely leap past rivals. A successful Kimberly-Clark investment, in contrast, requires less guesswork. It offers the same healthy mix of sales growth and above-average dividends that shareholders have enjoyed for years. In my view, that reliability makes Kimberly-Clark the more attractive bet right now, given how cloudy the operating picture is at P&G.

vator vatorX vatornews Register Log in Newsroom Innovation series Interviews Lessons learned Trends & news Will Procter & Gamble buy The Honest Company? Commerce M&A is on the rise, is the eco-friendly consumer company next? Financial trends and news by Steven Loeb September 9, 2016 | Comments Short URL: http://vator.tv/n/471f "'Why not? Why can't that be us? Why can't we build a foundation to become that [P&G] over the course of the next 100 years?'" said Brian Lee, co-Founder and CEO of The Honest Company, on stage with Bambi Francisco at Vator Splash La in 2014. Lee was responding to a question about Lee's vocal aspirations to become the next P&G. Well -- why not? Startups need to think big, after all. But a lot has changed since then - namely a rocky economy that's started a lot of M&A, and big ones in the commerce industry. There was Unilever buying Dollar Shave Club for $1 billion, and Walmart buying Jet for $3 billion. Now The Honest Company, the subscription service for eco-friendly baby and family products, could be the next commerce to be snapped up. The Santa Monica company, which was founded by former ShoeDazzle CEO Lee, along with actress Jessica Alba, is currently in talks to sell to what is described as "a big consumer product company," most likely either Procter & Gamble or Unilever, according to report from ReCode on Friday.  It's not a surprise. As Lee talked about at Vator Splash LA in 2014, P&G could use a little bit of The Honest Company's fresher and theoretically more eco-friendly brand.  "We are trying to build a foundation for a modern day family brand. You look at these large CPG companies that exist, they all start at some point. I mean P&G, it was either Mr. Procter or Mr. Gamble that was selling ivory soap out of the back of his truck, and they grew from there. And, so, we kind of look at these large companies out there and say, 'Why not? Why can't that be us?" said Lee.  If this deal goes go through, whoever winds up buying Honest will be putting down a good chunk of change. The company has raised $222 million in funding, most recently a $100 million round in August of last year, which valued it at $1.7 billion. Founded in 2011, the company designs and manufactures all of its own products, such as diapers, wipes and bath/skin care. The Honest Company also formulates and manufactures household cleaning products, such as laundry detergent, surface cleaners and dish soap. In late 2015, Honest launched its own line of beauty products as well.  The company sells "bundles" of items at set costs, including the Diapers & Wipes Bundle; The Essentials Bundle, which allows users to pick five cleaning items to ship every month; and The Health & Wellness Bundle, in which users pay for two vitamin/supplement items. In addition to selling directly to customer, The Honest Company makes money by selling products wholesale to various retail partners, such as Target, WholeFoods, Nordstroms, and Costco, among others. ReCode reports that the company saw revenue of around $300 million in 2015, up from $170 million in 2014, and $60 million in 2013. Even as revenue is rising, not everything has been going well, though, as Honest has been facing accusations and lawsuits over some of its products.  In 2015, the company saw hit with multiple lawsuits from consumers claiming that its sunscreen was "ineffective." Honest was also accused, earlier this year, of selling detergent with a chemical it had said it would avoid.  Alba dismissed these allegations in an interview with the Today Show earlier this month.  “If an organization wants to bring awareness to their cause, I’m an easy target and our brand is an easy target obviously, because I get a different kind of attention than other brands would,” she said. “We stand by our ingredients, the effectiveness of the products and we’re pretty optimistic that we’re going to win every case.” On the more positive side of things, The Honest Company has also been a frequent target of IPO speculation, with reports earlier this year that it was working with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to prepare to go public. By this summer, however, those plans had been put on hold.  During his Splash LA interview, Lee also spoke about his thoughts on a potential IPO for Honest , stating that he had no intentions to ever sell the company.  "We never started this company with the intent of selling it. We started this company really with the idea that we could make a difference in this world and really create safer and healthier environments for everybody," he said. "I think that, to achieve that, you have to reach a certain scale. You're not changing the world, you're not saying that many people, if you're doing $20 million in revenue. Even $100, $200, $500 million. You get there by being dramatically large and I think the only way we can achieve that by is taking the company public." Spokespeople for Unilever and The Honest Company would not comment on the report. VatorNews reached out Procter & Gamble for comment on any ongoing talks. We will update this story if we learn more.

P&G forecasts the strong dollar will hurt full-year earnings. Fred Katayama reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript The strong dollar slammed profit at P&G, the world's largest household products company, The maker of Tide detergent and CoverGirl makeup, which sells goods in 180 countries, said profit slid 31 percent in the latest quarter. Earnings would've risen if it weren't for currency translations. Procter & Gamble cut costs, but that wasn't enough to overcome the mighty dollar. Net sales shrank across its lineup from beauty and hair products to health care and baby care. P&G has been trying to boost profit by drastically shrinking the number of products it makes. It recently sold its Duracell battery business and Camay and Zest soap brands. But its margin shrank again. Look for foreign exchange to continue to pummel earnings. P&G called the outlook for this year "challenging," predicting that the currency impact will cut profit by 12 percent. It said it would try to offset that by further cutting costs. P&G has lots of company. DuPont, United Technologies and Pfizer also blamed the dollar for their weak full-year forecasts. P&G's shares, which have outperformed rivals Kimberly Clark and Unilever over the past 12 months, fell in early trading.

Slate Sign In Sign Up Jessica Alba’s Startup Might Be for Sale Jessica Alba’s Startup Might Be for Sale Slate Sign In Sign Up Slate Moneybox A blog about business and economics. Sept. 9 2016 4:08 PM Jessica Alba’s Startup Might Be for Sale By Zoe Henry   Jessica Alba arrives on the red carpet in Hainan, China, on Oct. 23, 2014. Aitor Alcalde/AFP/Getty Images This post originally appeared on Inc. The Honest Co., the startup co-founded by actress Jessica Alba in 2011, is in talks to become acquired by another firm, according to Recode. That firm could be a larger consumer products company, such as Procter & Gamble or Unilever, sources said. Advertisement The fast-growing consumer goods company is estimated to bring in some $250 million in revenue this year through sales of its nontoxic, personal care products, including diapers, sunscreen, and baby formula. It was previously said to be considering an IPO this spring, though later scrapped those plans for fear of an unreceptive public market, according to Recode. The Honest Co. had set itself apart from the competition by promising not to use health-compromising chemicals in its products. Still, the startup has come under fire as of late, with several lawsuits claiming that some of the products contain chemicals it promised not to use, such as sodium lauryl sulfate. The Honest Co. has called these suits "baseless." Get Slate in your inbox. So far, the 5-year-old company has raised $222 million, and is valued at an impressive $1.7 billion. It wouldn't be the first consumer products firm to sell to a larger company, as traditional retailers recognize the growing importance of e-commerce. Earlier this summer, Dollar Shave Club, the subscription-based retailer of men's grooming products, was sold to Unilever for $1 billion. A majority of the Honest Co.'s sales come through its own websites, which would be attractive to a potential acquirer. And similar to Dollar Shave Club, its customers can subscribe for monthly deliveries of bundled products, which makes up some 80 percent of its e-commerce sales, according to co-founder and CEO Brian Lee. "The bundles work really well for us, and subscriptions represent a pretty large portion of our revenues," Lee told Inc.'s Lindsay Blakely in an on-stage interview last year. "It's extremely helpful for predictability and forecasting of inventory."

Jessica Alba’s Honest Company, a venture-backed start-up that sells eco-friendly diapers and other premium personal-care products, may be be looking for a buyer. Recode reports that Alba’s company, which has raised $222 million in funding and was recently valued at $1.7 billion, has been in talks to sell itself to a consumer packaged-goods company like Unilever or Procter & Gamble. If the company sells for anything near its current valuation, it could mean a massive payday for Alba, who reportedly owns between 15 and 20 percent of the company—a stake worth as much as $340 million. The health-conscious motivation behind Alba’s decision to start the Honest Company turned out to be remarkably prescient. As is now tech-industry lore, Alba was terrified when she broke out in hives after washing her unborn baby’s onesie with laundry detergent. “I was thinking, what if my baby has a reaction and I don’t know? What if her throat is closing?” she told Vanity Fair in a recent profile. In 2011, she decided to get serious about finding products she could safely use on her own kids, launching the Honest Company with C.E.O. Brian Lee, President Sean Kane, and Chief Product Officer Christopher Gavigan. And fellow health-conscious consumers responded. What began as a small company selling just 17 items took in $300 million in revenue in 2015, according to Recode. The Honest Company has not escaped criticism or controversy. Last year, its S.P.F.-30 sunblock came under fire after consumers claimed it wasn’t actually effective at blocking the sun, leading to a $5 million class-action lawsuit. The company’s liquid laundry detergent has also faced scrutiny for allegedly containing sodium lauryl sulfate, a chemical compound the Honest Company had said it would “never consider for use in anything. Period.” (The Honest Company has responded that sodium coco sulfate, which it uses, is not the same as sodium lauryl sulfate, and has said that its sunscreen was found to be safe and effective after testing by a third party.) Alba’s company, which was reportedly preparing for an initial public offering, chose not to move forward its plans earlier this year, according to Recode. But the timing may be improving for a sale. Larger, more established consumer-product companies seem to be gravitating toward acquiring start-ups with successful online operations. In July, Unilever purchased the direct-to-consumer razor company Dollar Shave Club in a $1 billion, all-cash deal. (Like Dollar Shave Club, the Honest Company makes the bulk of its online sales through monthly subscription fees.) A month later, Jet, a year-old Amazon competitor, was said to be in talks to be acquired by Walmart to the tune of $3.3 billion.

Unilever: A Leading Consumer Goods Company Is Now On Sale (Seeking Alpha) Actress Jessica Alba is in talks to sell the diaper and personal care product company she co-founded. Alba co-founded The Honest Company, which places a heavy emphasis on selling non-toxic household products. She launched the company in 2011 with Brian Lee, an entrepreneur who co-founded Legalzoom.com and ShoeDazzle.com. According to a Recode report, Alba is now in talks to sell the company, and the likely buyer could be a large consumer product company, such as Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG) or Unilever plc (ADR) (NYSE: UL). Recode added that Alba's company was recently valued at $1.7 billion last year when it raised $100 million. Related Link: FDA Orders Stores To Cleanse Their Shelves Of Ineffective Hand Soaps Alba may have also picked an opportunistic time in discussing a potential sale. Consumer-packaged goods companies are now "grappling with the increasing importance of e-commerce to their future" but have also "become intrigued by startups" that boast large followings. Forty (40) percent of Honest Company's business comes from selling through the traditional retail landscape and the remainder comes from online sales. Finally, Honest Company was preparing itself for an initial public offering in February of this year but those plans were put on hold. Sources familiar with the situation told Recode that the company did not feel that the public market was going to be receptive to its offering at the time.

The class of 2015 on the advanced management programme at Barcelona’s IESE Business School went further than most by setting themselves up as a business angel network. The decision to form PDG Invest, named after the Spanish initials for the IESE management course, is all the more remarkable because none of the 40 members had any significant experience as angel investors. Ramón Faus Ramón Faus, who came to study at IESE after working for several years as a senior corporate lawyer, exudes excitement about being part of a link to Barcelona’s fast growing start-up community. “When I was a lawyer in the Spanish division of Procter & Gamble I was an employee,” he says. “When you are launching a project like this, you feel it is yours.” A fundamental question was whether another angel network was needed in a city like Barcelona, whose success as an entrepreneurial hotspot is, in large part, thanks to a plentiful supply of rich individuals looking to back local early stage ventures. Faus argues that the city does and stresses that PDG Invest distinguishes itself from its peers in that its members have years of experience from the senior executive level. “Our way to compete is the know-how of the 40,” he says. PDG Invest has a €1m investment fund to put into new ventures in Barcelona, created by each of its members committing to put in €8,000 per annum over 10 years. This makes the investment for each individual affordable, according to Faus. The goal is to invest in 10 early stage start-ups with the potential, not yet realised, of achieving a period of rapid growth that could provide substantial returns for the investors’ original stake. Not all 40 PDG Invest members have to commit their money to every investment. Only 13 agreed to back PDG Invest’s first two companies, a cosmetics business called Cocunat and a smartphone app for classified advertisements called 500 Markets, both of which received €100,000. The risk of encouraging management students with little or no experience of investing to become business angels is reduced by the shared experience of individual PDG Invest members, according to Faus. The size of the group means that there is usually at least one person who understands the sector an investment opportunity operates in, he notes. “We have no hurry,” he says, adding that PDG Invest received 50 funding proposals in its first three months of operation, thanks partly to entrepreneurs attending IESE’s start-up events. “There are many projects, but not many good ones and you have to choose well,” Faus notes. “We know that out of 10 investments, five or six will go wrong. For us it is going to be a great learning experience.” Another PDG Invest member is Agustín Andujar, who before coming to study at IESE was a manager at Dow Chemical Spain. “In my opinion we are going a little bit fast,” he says about the speed with which former classmates have signed up to the first two investments. “But hopefully in a good way.” Trust in his fellow students’ judgment is critical, according to Andujar. Although PDG Invest has a process for assessing funding bids, the final call tends to come down to each member’s instinct, Andujar admits. “It is the stomach,” he says. “What is the impression we are getting of these companies from our stomach.” Whether the group can make any money from its chosen investments is uncertain. But according to Andujar this is not critical. The biggest selling point for him, apart from remaining in regular contact with his former classmates, is the feeling that he is helping hard-working people develop their businesses. Barcelona has gained a reputation as an entrepreneur-friendly city in recent years, helped by the high quality of life, low cost of living and positive global image the city has fostered in recent decades. “We are helping with this entrepreneurial society,” Andujar says. “We are the good guys.” Luisa García-Valdecasas This is echoed by Luisa García-Valdecasas, another PDG Invest member, who also works in the fundraising team at IESE. She stresses that it is critical to support job creation among young people in a country where their employment prospects are limited. “It is very important to have these people adding value to the economy,” she says. A short walk from the IESE campus, at Barcelona’s other business school, Esade, there is another, more established, angel investor programme for former students. Esade Business Angel Network (Ban), which recently won the award for Europe’s best private network of business angels, comprises more than 200 private investors. Out of the 600 projects it analyses a year, it has invested a total of more than €15m in 94 companies over the past four years. Channelling more than €4m into 43 entrepreneurial projects last year. The team hopes to invest a similar amount in 2016. The catalyst for forming Esade Ban in 2008 was the school’s 17,000-strong alumni organisation of former students, according to Fernando Zallo, Esade Ban’s director. The biggest selling point is the feeling of helping hard-working people develop their businesses One of the main goals of Esade Ban is to add discipline to those looking to become angel investors. “We want to professionalise the network,” he says. Esade Ban operates alongside other initiatives created by the school to boost new businesses, Zallo notes, including EGarage and EWorks, incubator programmes designed respectively to advance start-ups. “We as a business school thought it would be good to give a service to local entrepreneurs, but on the other side alumni were keen to invest,” he says. Business schools are good breeding grounds for angel networks because they can pool a critical mass of people with the brains and resources to invest, reducing the risks for any one individual taking part, according to Zallo. “We have created a school for business angels,” he says. “We try to teach students that this is a very risky investment class so you need to invest with others.”  Sample the FT’s top stories for a week You select the topic, we deliver the news.

Now it is specifying “social media” as its main source of news, with that niche overtaking television for the first time. The information comes from a study done by The Oxford University Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. It looked at consumers of news and information around the world for its “Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2016.” This is the fifth year it has issued such a report. It’s a fascinating report. Twenty-eight percent of 18-24 year-olds say social media is their main source of news, compared to 24 percent who cite television. Since 2013, the number of people in the US who say they get their news from social media has doubled – 46 percent now use social media for news. A lot of news sites are ramping up their development of video, betting on it as a growth strategy. Ad revenue is better on video. But the study finds the news audience isn’t so keen on seeing video. More than three-quarters still rely on text. Many find video inconvenient, with 35 percent citing pre-roll advertisements as an annoyance. News tends to be consumed at work—and the person in the cubicle next to you isn’t always thrilled to hear the full-blast volume of a Geico ad. When it comes to social media, Facebook rules the roost for sharing news. 44 percent of the survey respondents say they use Facebook for news, compared to just 10 percent from Twitter. 19 percent use YouTube for news. Snapchat, which is new to the news game, only registered one percent. We love to share news. A quarter of us share news via social media at least once a week. An interesting note: people in the US generally share stories they approve of, but people in the UK are more likely to share stories about things they don’t like. Read into national character what you will. What do social media news users want most? Breaking news. And this year, for the first time, the study tracked users of smart watches. They, too, want breaking news most on their device. The study is comprehensive and well worth a read. The audience keeps shifting, and the only thing that’s predictable is that it gets more social and more fragmented in a digital world in motion! Brands pitch in on Louisiana flood relief Following historic floods in Louisiana, numerous brands pitching-in on relief efforts. Target, Walmart, Starbucks and Tide all contributed in the wake of the epic rainfall that flooded the area with more than 6.9 trillion gallons of water in August. Target, which has six stores and over 1,000 staffers in the Baton Rouge area and other affected areas, has pitched in with volunteers and distribution of water and gift cards to local nonprofits. The retailer has also donated $100,000 each to the Salvation Army and American Red Cross. Similarly, Walmart announced that its foundation will give $1 million to various nonprofits including the Greater Baton Rouge Food Bank in support. In total, the retail chain is committing $1.5 million for food and supplies. “We have been working closely with nonprofit partners, first responders, elected officials and governmental organizations to learn how we can use our strengths to help,” said Kathleen McLaughlin, president of the Walmart Foundation, in a statement. In late August, Tide, which is owned by Procter & Gamble, sent its Loads of Hope truck to Baton Rouge in order to collect, wash and dry laundry free of charge for victims affected by the floods. P&G also handed out cleaning products including Mr. Clean and Swiffer. Duracell also sent its truck with batteries and a charging station. Starbucks donated $100,000 to the American Red Cross, and the brand encouraged customers and employees to text “LAFLOODS” to 90999 in order to donate $10 to the relief fund. Some brands have taken their efforts in an untraditional direction. Pizza Hut started a GoFundMe page asking for contributions to help staffers affected by the tragedy. In addition, the Ad Council and GSD&M recently unveiled a black-and-white ad, “Our Turn,” in response to the disaster, which is the country’s worst since 2012’s Hurricane Katrina. The film, which includes a voiceover from Matthew McConaughey, directs viewers to OurTurntoHelp.org. Candy brands honor Gene Wilder, Willy Wonka News of actor Gene Wilder’s death took the internet by storm, and opened a flood of candy-inspired, tributes to the “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” from colleagues, fans and – Inevitably – candy brands. During his long career, Wilder was known for many films including the Oscar-nominated “Young Frankenstein” and “Blazing Saddles.” But sweet-toothed brands have been chiming in on Twitter to thank the star for his contributions to, you guessed it, the world of chocolate for his turn as Willy Wonka. The 90-year-old chocolatier Godiva Chocolates shared a tribute with its 17,200 followers: “Thank you Gene Wilder for making chocolate truly magical, the original Willy Wonka.” Also, the Twitter account for U.K. candy brand New Berry Fruits chose “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” as its film of the day. Smaller brands like candy retailer McMillers Sweets have also chimed in. It RIP’d the actor as the “original Candyman.” While the tweets have attracted only positive remarks – and reminiscent smiles – so far, brands that choose to grieve celebrities publicly enter murky territory. There are big risks when it comes to summoning personal tragedy – particularly when your tribute mentions your product in the same breath. Case in point: Crocs deleted its tribute to the late David Bowie (a shoe overlaid with the singer’s iconic lightning bolt) after Twitter users criticized it as opportunistic. Equally, Cheerios irked Prince fans with an RIP tweet that dotted the “I” with a single Cheerio. Other messages for Wilder were more personal. DeBrand Fine Chocolates simply wrote that the actor was a childhood inspiration. While Dandelion Chocolate, a bean-to-bar factory in San Francisco, added that it showed Wilder’s 1971 classic every year. Sweet memories, indeed, for one of our world’s greatest actors. Melted Mic | Samsung’s Galactic Image Goes Up In Flames! Samsung’s brand has melted into a tech nightmare! The South Korean electronics giant was forced to suspend sales of its new flagship smartphone, the Galaxy Note 7, last Friday because dozens of the handsets have exploded. The phone, which has been extremely well reviewed, is now also being recalled worldwide, in a move that is likely to cost Samsung millions. And compounding matters, the colossal disaster came on the eve of the launch of a new iPhone from Samsung’s archrival Apple – which launched new versions of its iPhone and watch on Wednesday. It’s a hard to overstate this Galactic brand blunder! When Samsung launched the Note 7, it had the stage to itself. It had the momentum. It had a very real shot at being the phone of 2016. But it’s reputation exploded instead. And replacing 2.5 million devices will cost Samsung hundreds of millions of dollars, and could certainly melt its sterling reputation for quality, at least for the foreseeable future. Each week, The Spin Cycle will bestow a Golden Mic Award to the person, group or company in the court of public opinion that best exemplifies the tenets of solid PR, marketing and advertising – and those who don’t.

At the board meeting of The Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) held today, Srinivasan K. Swamy, chairman and managing director, R K SWAMY BBDO, was unanimously elected chairman of the board of ASCI. He has over forty years of advertising experience to his credit, and has also been a member of the board of governors of ASCI for close to ten years. Abanti Sankaranarayanan, vice chairperson, Confederation of Indian Alcohol Beverage Companies (CIABC), was elected vice-chairman, while Shashidhar Sinha, CEO, Media Brands was re-appointed the honorary treasurer. Other members of the board of governors include Al Rajwani (managing director and chief executive, Procter & Gamble Hygiene and Healthcare), Benoy Roychowdhury (executive director, HT Media), Dev Bajpai (executive director legal and corporate affairs and company secretary, Hindustan Unilever), D Shivakumar (chairman and CEO, PepsiCo India Holdings), Gurmit Singh (vice president and MD, Yahoo India), N.S. Rajan (global partner and MD, Ketchum Sampark ), Narendra Ambwani (director, Agro Tech Foods), Prashant Singh (MD, Neilsen India Region), Raj Jain (CEO, Bennett Coleman & Co.), Rohit Gupta (president - network sales and international business, Sony Pictures Networks India), S.K. Palekar (adjunct professor and advisor - executive education, Institute of Management Technology), Subhash Kamath (managing partner, BBH Comms India) and Sunil Lulla (chairman and managing director, Grey Worldwide India). Commenting on the development, Benoy Roychowdhury, the outgoing chairman of ASCI says, "It has been quite an exhilarating year for ASCI. We entered into the second year of collaboration with the Department of Consumer Affairs (DoCA), and processed more than 1000 complaints against misleading advertisements received through their portal: Grievances Against Misleading Advertisements (GAMA - gama.gov.in). Encouraged by the success of the mobile app, we launched a WhatsApp Number +91 77100 12345 for consumers to send in complaints conveniently. ASCI continues to grow from strength to strength, and as the Chairman for 2015-16, I am very happy to have been an enabler for this journey." The incoming Chairman, Srinivasan K. Swamy, states, "It is indeed an honour to be elected as Chairman of ASCI which has progressively contributed to effective self-regulation in advertising content. We are confident that the marketing and advertising sectors, industry bodies, regulators, consumer activists and the general public will actively seek ASCI's services and make self-regulation more relevant in the increasing competitive environment. ASCI will continue to engage with stakeholders such as Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), Ministry of AYUSH, Ministry of Road, Transport and Highways (MORTH) to propagate self-regulation, in addition to DoCA. It is heartening to note that the Parliamentary Standing Committee has recognized the role played by ASCI and has recommended that it be given some legal teeth. I am therefore quite excited to take over the mantle as ASCI Chairman at this time when so many important things are on the anvil to further strengthen the principles of self-regulation. I hope to make 2016-17, yet another landmark year." During the year 2015-16, the Consumer Complaints Council (CCC) constituted by ASCI as an independent body (which has majority of its members drawn from civil society members including consumer activists, lawyers, doctors and educationists) met 49 times and deliberated on complaints against a total of 1389 advertisements. Of these, complaints against 891 advertisements were upheld, while 497 were not upheld, and a complaint against one advertisement was considered to be 'Non-issue'. As is the normal practice, all advertisers who do not follow recommendations to modify or withdraw the offending advertisement, will be referred to the concerned regulator for further action if they consider necessary. The Advertising Standards Council of India is a self-regulatory organisation for the advertising industry. Established in 1985, ASCI's role has been acclaimed by various government agencies. It is recognised under 'The Cable Television Network Rules, 1994' which states that 'No advertisement which violates the code for self-regulation in advertising, as adopted by the Advertising Standard Council of India (ASCI), Mumbai, for public exhibition in India, from time to time, shall be carried in the cable service'. ASCI is the executive arm of the Department of Consumer Affairs handling all complaints pertaining to misleading advertisements. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India has also partnered with it to address misleading advertisements in the food and beverages sector. The Role and Functioning of the ASCI and its Consumer Complaints Council (CCC) is in dealing with complaints received from consumers and Industry, against advertisements which are considered as false, misleading, indecent, illegal, leading to unsafe practices, or unfair to competition, and consequently in contravention of the ASCI Code for Self-Regulation in Advertising. 18SHARES Follow afaqs!

In fact, the city is quickly becoming one of the greenest, most innovative cities in the country. No longer known for just chili, baseball and the second largest Octoberfest in the world (outside of Munich), Cincinnati is evolving into a hub for technology, sustainability and social innovation. Startup Cincy Many people think of the U.S. tech industry as a bi-coastal phenomenon, but between Silicon Valley and New York City lies 3,000 miles of countryside dotted with booming business hubs. In fact, within the next five years, the Midwest will have more startups than Silicon Valley.  One of the fastest growing centers for tech innovation is Cincinnati. The city has seen the biggest startup growth in the nation as one of five metros jumping drastically in rank over the past year, according to the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurship. Home to the headquarters of 10 Fortune 500 companies, including Macy’s and Procter & Gamble, the metropolitan area also supports a growing community of tech startups through accelerator programs, low business taxes and connecting entrepreneurs with established companies and funding. “There’s a community of entrepreneurship [here] that you wouldn’t necessarily expect in a flyover city,” Mike Bott,  the co-founder of popular Cincinnati-based startup accelerator, The Brandery – told Entrepreneur. Recognized as one of the top accelerator programs in the U.S., The Brandery pushes startups through a four-month program, providing each with $20,000 in seed money and mentorship. And they’re not alone. Millions of dollars are invested in Cincinnati based startups each year through a variety of incubators, accelerators and innovative funding strategies. It’s not that Cincinnati has more money than other Midwestern cities, it’s just that those with the money are more deeply connected to the ecosystem of people and young companies with innovative ideas. Sustainable Cincy Cincinnati has about 60 sustainability initiatives outlined in the Green Cincinnati Plan which covers everything from renewable energy, to transportation, to food waste. The City’s ambitious sustainability efforts are focused on opportunities to meet multiple objectives at the same time. “In addition to benefiting the environment, our initiatives must make economic sense (save money, create jobs) and improve quality of life for residents (improve public health, mobility, connectedness)” explained Ollie Kroner, the Sustainability Coordinator for the City of Cincinnati. As a newly appointed, passionate Millennial, Kroner brings a fresh, visionary perspective to the position. “Our office takes on some of the world’s biggest, most challenging problems and we develop strategies that aim to improve quality of life for Cincinnatians as global citizens. It’s an opportunity to think big and be innovative. Honestly, it’s a big, difficult dream job” Kroner told TriplePundit. And the city has already come a long way. It was one of the first major cities to move to 100 percent green energy for its residents and businesses through the city’s Green Electricity Aggregation program. Not only did this reduce city emissions by approximately 247,000 tons of carbon dioxide each year, but also saves nearly $7 million dollars for the city annually. “There are several big picture issues we are looking at right now” said Kroner. “How can we accelerate the adoption of energy efficiency upgrades and solar energy? How can we divert our organic waste stream from the landfill? How can we prepare our city for electric vehicles? How can we embrace Smart City technologies to improve our environment, economy, and quality of life?” The City of Cincinnati has several exciting projects on the horizon. “We are currently working to roll out curbside textile and housewares recycling for residents. Anything you would have taken to Goodwill will be accepted for curbside pickup. We estimate these items to constitute 11 percent of our current waste stream, so this is an opportunity to put a big dent in our landfilled waste.” Solarize Cincinnati has installed solar panels on 20 homes in just the past two months and that pace is expected to accelerate. The Metropolitan Sewer District of Greater Cincinnati is pursuing anaerobic digestion to turn sewage sludge into an asset. This technology would replace incineration with a process similar to composting. Rather than burning the “waste,” sewage sludge can be a source of renewable energy and a fertilizer product. These are just a few of the many ideas the city is cooking up. Innovative Cincy When it comes to the intersection of sustainability and innovation, Cincinnati is certainly thinking outside the box. The city is exploring issues like how sustainability can be used to combat poverty, crime prevention through environmental design and how we can leverage the power of big data to drive change. Last year the City of Cincinnati completed building a LEED Platinum Net-Zero district police headquarters. The new solar and geothermal powered building consumes less than 50 percent of the energy used by traditionally designed facilities of the same size, making it a strong contender for the greenest building in Ohio. The Net-Zero Police Headquarters has green features that double as security features – like high-performance windows that insulate, but are also bulletproof; daylighting that reduces the need for artificial light, but also provides high visibility around the site and storm water collection that allows the rain to infiltrate into the soil, but also provides a physical barrier that would prevent a vehicle from crashing into the building. The city is currently evaluating the building’s performance to see if it can serve as a model for future city buildings. One day in the not so distant future, cities all over the globe will be tapping into big data to assess and drive change amongst their constituents. They will be able to access clear and concise data from every department that they oversee. For the City of Cincinnati, the dream is already a reality. “The City’s leadership has prioritized the use of data to drive good government decision-making.” explained Kroner. “We are currently working to build a dashboard of sustainability indicators to help us track the impact and progress of our sustainability initiatives. For example, by using smart sensors on our recycling bins, Cincinnati now has the largest publicly-owned body of recycling behavior data in the country. We use this data to target our outreach efforts to improve recycling participation rates.” “Many aspects of sustainability require behavioral changes – drive less, eat healthier, drop empty cans in the recycling instead of the trash” said Kroner. “Generally speaking, people don’t like change. Old habits die hard. Designing a program that provides multiple benefits and minimizes harms is hurdle number one. Communicating the benefits of a proposed change can be even harder.” However challenging the journey may be, it’s clear that Cincinnati is on the right track. It’s definitely one of the cities to watch in the coming years.

Statistics from Fortune Magazine says that 9 out of 10 Start-ups fail and the U.S. Census Bureau reports that 400,000 new businesses are started every year in the USA, however, 470,000 struggle to stay afloat at the same rate. Though the numbers are scary, it gives insight to the fierceness of the modern market place. The good news is that innovative businesses are surging ahead in spite of tougher competition, segmented markets and evolving consumer preferences. Multinationals like Cadbury, Coca-Cola, Nestle, Procter & Gamble and a few other companies have gained prominence in Africa over the years – thanks to their dynamism, innovation, experience and people. Surprisingly, new market entrants such as: Google, Facebook, Uber and the Telecoms multinational TECNO in a short time of business operations, have been able to consolidate market presence in their various markets. Speaking of market leadership, the rise of the TECNO brand from the low segment of the mobile market to a highly competitive high-end smartphone leader has been nothing short of a marketing brilliance. The Rise of Africa’s leading mobile brand; a case study on tech innovation success Back track to 2006 when TECNO entered the African markets with its revolutionary dual SIM technology. Nonetheless, the mobile maker struggled with negative consumer sentiments in its interest markets, particularly Nigeria where mobile users considered TECNO products to be substandard. Fast-forward to 2016 and TECNO brand has completely evolved—a leader in smartphone; the brand rolls out smartphone products year on year with good product reviews. In the Nigerian mobile space, an estimated 6 out of 10 persons use a TECNO mobile product, if the figure is anything to go by then, this means that TECNO smartphones are now the consumers’ preferred mobile. The brand’s different product lines namely: TECNO Boom, CAMON and the Phantom series have become very popular with mobile consumers, tech analysts and enthusiasts. Presently, TECNO smartphone products can stand head-to-head with top smartphone competitions in Africa. Interestingly, reports on mobile phone sales volume released by a Nigerian based research agency for November 2014 to May 2015 put TECNO on top in most African markets. The report also revealed that TECNO sold more mobile phones in Nigeria and Tanzania than any other OEM company in the period of the review. TECNO comes in second position in the Ghana, Cameroon and Ethiopia markets. In the Kenyan market, it maintains the third position behind Nokia and Samsung. The main markets of TECNO Mobile Overall, the research revealed that TECNO controlled 25.1% market share in six markets. While the report didn’t account for sales performance in other markets, it hinted TECNO popularity in African markets and places the brand’s smartphone products amongst markets sort-after in Africa, Middle East and Southern Asia regions. A community-centred business module, TECNO CSRs touch host communities Corporate Social Responsibilities, a success template that several leading global companies have adopted proves to be a good business case for brand marketing and TECNO has imbued the CSR culture in its business module across markets. Through life-touching projects, they are empowering people and communities. Worthy of mention of such project is the Light Up Ikeja initiative; a CSR project executed in the first quarter of 2016. Eighty plus (80+) solar-powered streetlights were installed in Ikeja’s electronic market (Popularly called Computer village) and environs to help with the security challenges faced in the area. Other Corporate Social Responsibility projects executed by TECNO include: scholarships for pupils in public primary schools in Nigeria (Lagos), support of the Michael Essien Foundation in Ghana, amongst others. TECNO light up Ikeja project TECNO’s ‘Give Children A Future’ scholarship program Clearly, dogged, innovative and visionary brands have a way of weathering the storm while consolidating market share. TECNO on its part has proven to be the smartphone constantly evolving to give consumers more value. The international launch of TECNO’s next flagship, the TECNO Phantom Series in Dubai this September could open a new global chapter for a mobile brand that has proven the African markets to be the best training ground for globally competitive multinationals.

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ Fred Hochberg has been chairman of ExportImport Bank of the United States for the past seven years, supporting US jobs and financing exporters from the world's largest economy.Hochberg was in India as part of the US delegation led by Secretary of State John Kerry. In an interview with ET's Joel Rebello and Gayatri Nayak, he spoke on a variety of issues ranging from India's economic potential, Indo-US trade, and the future of Exim banks in a free market.Edited excerpts: Bilateral trade between India and the US is more than $100 billion now. How do you assess the future potential? It is a big focus of the bank because there is so much opportunity here. After the election of the PM, I have seen growing optimism from Indian business people in terms of the economy moving and with reforms like GST, bankruptcy code which were hard to push through. There's lot of enthusiasm on opportunities in power, renewables, transportation and infrastructure. There are ambitious goals on renewable and nuclear energy and also on transportation. We met with the managing director of Air India which has been making dramatic improvements. SpiceJet is expanding, so is Jet Airways. Over the next decade, India will become more and more part of the global supply chain. We try not to have a target at Exim Bank but let's remember that 80 per cent of global growth is from India, the US and China. We have to get the rest of the world to start growing because three countries cannot pull the entire global economy. How is Make in India helping US business? What is the opportunity for Indian companies to grow in your market? It is in the interest of the US and the world that India becomes a stronger economy. A part of making India a strong economy is like making India an export powerhouse so that it is part of the trade between nations, and Make in India is part of that.I met with people from Procter & Gamble and other companies in Delhi. A lot of the manufacturing is done locally. The biggest potential is renewable energy. I don't know any other country that has as ambitious plans as India in terms of renewable and solar energy. As India solves shortage of power, it could grow by one to two points faster -from a high of 7 per cent to close to 10 per cent. In the past few years, there were big trade pacts being worked like TPP. Your views... TPP is still being negotiated in the US. It still has to come to vote in the US Congress. The less barriers there are to trade, the less friction there is; and as goods and services flow freely, they benefit both economies. When we did our first major deal in the mid-nineties, there were a dozen free trade agreements, today there are 600. How would you manage to push exports when global demand is subdued? Global growth rates are clearly down. It means that everybody has to work a little bit harder, sharpen your pencils because it is more competitive to win those sales, whether it is aircraft or nuclear power or power equipment or medical equipment. I think US companies are fine tuning.They have to fight harder, dig deeper and be more innovative to win those sales. India is a perfect of case where cost of solar power has fallen faster than anybody would have imagined in my time at Exim Bank. Air India flies energy-efficient aircraft. innovation is going to be the clear winner in terms of product sales and increasing economic activity. There are challenges. But the next five years are still promising. Should Exim Banks continue in a free market economy? There are 85 export credit agencies around the world. Partly, the private sector does a very good job. But very good does not mean perfect. So, when it comes to small businesses and SMEs, the private sector sometimes falls short. We step in and make sure that small businesses can export and take advantage of the global markets. The other role is where we have large capital equipment that needs 12-18 years' financing, like solar power. Particularly after the financial crisis, the Basel III reforms make it more difficult for a commercial bank to make a commercial loan for long periods. So, we step in such unique circumstances -small businesses which always find it difficult to find credit, large capital equipment projects that need 12, 15, 18 years loans. When the private sector steps in, we step back, and when the private sector steps back, we step in just to make sure trade flows and keep people working.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / More than 40 Top Grocers and CPG Brands Come Together to Discuss the Future of Online Grocery More than 40 Top Grocers and CPG Brands Come Together to Discuss the Future of Online Grocery Posted on September 8, 2016 by Benzinga Full Feed in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer MyWebGrocer’s annual Customer Days event convenes key industry players to discuss latest trends and opportunities shaping the future of grocery, including greater in-industry collaboration and innovative approaches to customer engagement. WINOOSKI, VT (PRWEB) September 08, 2016 MyWebGrocer, the leading provider of eCommerce and digital marketing solutions to the grocery and consumer packaged goods (CPG) industries, held their annual Customer Days event August 1-3 in Winooski, VT. The conference focused on understanding consumer shopping trends and discussing the future of online grocery, and resulted in insightful thought-sharing by the industry’s big-name, digital pioneers. In attendance were some of North America’s largest grocery retailers, including Albertsons, Giant Eagle and Wakefern, as well as representatives from top CPG brands including Pepsico, P&G, The Hershey Company and General Mills. Conversations revolved around untapped opportunities for grocers and CPG brands to come together to develop a sustainable eCommerce presence for the industry. Throughout the event, common threads in dialogue focused on the evolving ways to engage with consumers, best practices for leveraging emerging digital channels and the importance of collaboration within the industry. The featured keynote speaker, Saj-nicole Joni, an acclaimed CEO advisor and author, presented a session discussing how leaders can effectively implement new strategies during times of digital transformation. The keynote showcased new ways for attendees to collaborate with industry partners to ultimately engage shoppers through new and unique approaches. Representatives from Pinterest and Google also presented on the evolution of consumer journeys and behaviors. Attendees gained key insights into the modern consumer journey, and learned how to best leverage customer data to inform targeted interactions. MyWebGrocer executive, Barry Clogan, also shared his thoughts on what would increase profitability in the online grocery space — organizational culture changes. “Two main themes that emerged throughout the event were innovation and discovery,” said Kimberly Aylward of Giant Eagle. “We’re seeing a rapid change in the grocery industry, and translating what has worked in stores to online has been a challenge. The insights shared at MyWebGrocer’s Customer Days event included serious and inspiring considerations, and provided me with the tools to continually strengthen our digital presence.” Key takeaways from additional presentations included emphasis on the value of achieving alignment in eCommerce priorities between grocers and brands, and of investing quality time and resources to build positive online shopper experiences. Discussions also focused on how grocers and brands can ensure an eCommerce channel is built to scale; and, how the two groups should work together to craft innovative omnichannel experiences for their customers. “It was thrilling for MyWebGrocer to have top industry leaders participate in groundbreaking thought-sharing regarding the future success of the online grocery industry,” said Eric Healy, President of MyWebGrocer. “Our team enjoyed spending time with our customers in person, and listening to their ambitions for the marketplace.

Cincinnati, OH (PRWEB) September 08, 2016 When Pam Brisley feeds her dogs, she wants to make sure Carmela and Rosco are getting kibble that’s nutritious and fresh. That’s why she switched her pups to Pet Wants. Now Brisley is excited to announce that she has opened her own Pet Wants business to deliver that quality food to pet families in the eastern Cincinnati region. Pet Wants’ carefully developed proprietary pet food is slow-cooked with fresh, all-natural ingredients. The company has their distributor make the dog and cat food in small batches once per month so every kibble is guaranteed to be fresh and packed with nutrition. Pet Wants East Cincinnati is a franchise of the Pet Wants Franchising Systems and the mobile service delivers to Blue Ash, Camp Dennison, Evendale, Landen, Loveland, Maineville, Milford, Montgomery, Morrow, Newtown, and Terrace Park. “I’ve been drawn to animals since I was a young child. My maternal grandparents were farmers, and my paternal grandparents were huge dog lovers. So, on both sides, I was always surrounded by animals. That experience taught me about proper care and, when I met with the Pet Wants team, I was impressed by the mission to offer fresh, natural, locally-sourced dog and cat food, and their goal to educate consumers on how critical good nutrition is to drive superior pet health,” Brisley said. I thought I knew a fair amount about pet nutrition until I, myself, was educated by the Pet Wants team. I’ve learned a great deal about what pets need to thrive, and can’t wait to share that information with my customers.     “I had never imagined myself owning a business – let alone it being something with animals – and I’m thrilled to bring this service to the East side of Cincinnati. I’m proud to share what makes Pet Wants the unique, stand-out brand it is in the market today,” she added. Prior to opening Pet Wants East Cincinnati, Brisley spent her career in the corporate arena, most recently at Procter & Gamble where she spent 17 years working across Consumer & Market Knowledge, Communications and Quality Assurance. She’s also an active volunteer with the Cincinnati Pet Food Pantry, which provides supplemental pet food to lower income families once per month, and drives for local dog rescue transports every week. Brisley lives in Walnut Hills with her dog, Carmela Soprano, a 5.5 YO Olde English Bulldog, and new rescue, Rosco P. Coltrane, a young Basset/German Shorthaired Pointer mix. “When most people buy pet food, they are just grabbing a bag off the shelf based on packaging or a TV commercial they saw. Pet Wants offers a more personal touch. I want to be a resource for pet families. I want them to know that, whether they end up going with Pet Wants or not, I am here to talk about our food, pet nutrition and health and any other pet-related concerns on their minds. That, combined with our quality food and convenient free delivery service, is what really sets us apart,” Brisley said. In addition to being made fresh monthly, Pet Wants only sources the best salmon, chicken, lamb, brown rice and other ingredients available. There’s no sugar added, no fillers and no animal by-products. And, since Pet Wants never uses corn, wheat, soy or dyes, the food is a great fit for pets with allergies. Pet Wants originally launched in Cincinnati in 2010. Owned by Michele Hobbs, the business was built to provide proprietary crafted, fresh, slow-cooked, all-natural pet food delivered to customers through a retail store and a convenient home-delivery service. Hobbs, now the company founder, turned the business into a franchise in 2015 with the help of Franchise Funding Group, an investment and franchise-development company designed to help entrepreneurs scale their companies nationally as franchise systems. To order Pet Wants food for your favorite companion or to learn about the company, call (513)751-PETS(7387), email PBrisley@PetWants.com, visit http://www.PetWantsCincyEast.com and like Pet Wants Cincy East on Facebook. Also keep an eye out for future Pet Wants “Pup Up” events in the East Cincinnati area! About Pet Wants: Pet Wants was started by Michele Hobbs out of love for her pets and frustration. Veterinarians were unable to help relieve her dog’s painful skin allergies. After doing much research, Michele discovered the national dog food brand she trusted was not fresh, not all natural, and lacked sufficient nutrition…and when pet food sits in warehouses and store shelves for months and months… it loses even more nutritional value. She was committed to developing a better solution for all dogs and cats. Their food is exclusively crafted… fresh, healthy, slow-cooked and all natural with no sugar added, no fillers and no animal by-products. They source only the best salmon, chicken, lamb, brown rice, and other ingredients. Fresh ingredients make for better food… and better health for pets. And since they never use corn, wheat, soy or dyes, the common pet health problems associated with these ingredients are no longer worries. Their fresh food is conveniently delivered to the customer within weeks of production, not months. Roughly half of Pet Wants products are sold through their store and half through their convenient, home-delivery program. You can learn more at http://www.PetWants.com.

In this episode of Marketing Nerds, Boz Boschen, Digital Media Director for ndp, joined me to talk about how far social advertising has come over the last several years. We also chatted about where it’s going, and how those in the advertising sphere are adapting. Here are a few transcribed excerpts from our discussion, but make sure to listen to the podcast to hear everything! How Social Media Advertising has Evolved Within digital media, it’s always interesting to see how consumer habits change over time. Looking at the pace of change, it always seems like the thing that pops up this weekend becomes popular where it’s completely unexpected. Of course, it’s very hard to look into that crystal ball and see where things will be in five or seven years. I think where we are today is really the age of platforms, as everyone is saying. It’s really becoming more about adjusting the ad experience to match that environment in social media. We know that users are spending vast amounts of time on Facebook. Noteworthy in the last week that Facebook weighed in on the ad blocking discussion and has said that they have a point of view on that. Of course, in a very Facebook way, it’s very tech-focused and tech solution rather than the overall philosophy of there’s a value exchange here. In order to get your social media fix, there needs to be some ads to help support it. It’s been really interesting to see what’s happened. Again, I think where we are is less transactional, more relational. Distinguishing Good Content Facebook, as a publicly traded company, looks at it and says “Here’s our short-term goal. We’ve got some things that we need to achieve with our revenue.” Also, measuring that against at what point are we going to turn off users? Do we see their time spent start to drop because we’re forcing more ads into the experience at the detriment of their overall use of Facebook? I think that they’re looking at all of that and trying to decide what’s the right role with this and those sorts of headlines or what’s getting people to engage. They’re experimenting as well with the ad types and the units that they’re employing. I think that they’re trying to test what’s the right environment in the role of the advertising. Smartphones being ubiquitous, what’s the right ad experience on mobile? It’s not going to be that kind of display banner from desktops shrunk down into a smaller space. How do we build something that’s immersive and full-screen and engaging and get somebody to raise their hand while they’re looking for that dopamine fix and scrolling through Facebook? Let’s give them a good experience here and let them go further on their own. I think it’s an interesting way to look at it. We’ve seen success with that for some of our clients and not repurposing creative, but really building something that’s native to the platform. It even plays into digital video. When you look at digital video and you’re going to run it in the Facebook environment, I think everybody now realizes it’s auto-play, it’s silent, it’s subtitled. What’s the right approach for that? How do we load our branding front end? Finding the Most Accessible Platform for Your Content There was Kodak. Now there’s really no longer Kodak, but there’s Instagram. We’re still interested in photography and photos and sharing things and creating memories and preserving them. I think that’s the overall point that there’s some innate human things that are going to continue. It’s just what is the platform. It may be fluid and it might be Facebook. It might be a little bit different. It might be something new that’s still in development. The tricky thing with digital is really overall tracking. That’s a question that comes up from clients all the time is what is the overall spend. What percentage of our budget should be in digital? How do we decide that for social media? Social can be very hard to track and digital as well. Transformation in Media Usage I guess in the overall industry trend over the last five years there’s was sort of a race in marketing tech and ad tech to add more tracking, to go deeper and understand these discreet segments and hyper-targeting populations and looking at everything at the most granular level. Now we’re hearing Procter & Gamble’s pulling back in a sense. Some of this could be a negotiating power as they’re looking at their overall budget with Facebook. I think the point can also be true that as they’re looking at Facebook overall and saying here is two hundred data points against each of these people, how do we then want to divide up our brand spend for direct response? Everything is infinitely measurable, but is that really the way to invest in the platform and the way to approach the audience in that transactional manner? Whatever happens, we’re still going to be looking at a sales funnel to some degree. Is Social Media Worth Investing Your Time and Money? I think it’s really talking to the client about their own goals, their target, understanding within that full target analysis, who are these people, what are their typical media behaviors, weighing social media against everything else that they’re doing in their daily lives and then the budget. How much budget is there and how far can we stretch it? If we look at those priorities, the audience might be fifty-five and older. They’re primarily broadcast, primetime viewers with a little bit of light online. Maybe they’re checking their bank statements and the weather or Facebook to follow-up with the grandkids, whatever it is. Again, it’s unique to each budget, each brand, each target. Making Your Brand Constantly Top of Mind Everybody has been talking about Olympics for the last week since it wrapped [a few weeks ago]. I think NBC is learning some hard lessons about trying to force fit content into the traditional broadcast primetime model and looking at an opportunity that was served up for a multitude of sports where people can go as deep as they want and follow everything as it’s happening. We do live in that world now where everybody gets breaking updates in their smartphones. If you’ve downloaded the app, you’ve opted in for the notifications; you’re going to see the notifications throughout the day. This broadcast partner has decided that they’re going to repackage the content and air it in primetime. I think there’s a limitation there in what they were expecting to happen with the TV viewership that didn’t really match what they were doing online. I think that just allowing the user to be free to engage where they want to and on their own terms and to go as deep as they want. What are you going to lose by having them go further in digital? You’re giving them the content they want. It’s going to trend on social regardless. Don’t fight it. Go with it.

So why not enlist in their help? After connecting at M2Moms® two years ago, Robyn and I began creating a pipeline of mom-focused innovation. After being immersed in everything mom, from their aspirations and challenges to their favorite products and purchasing motivations, we identified a significant opportunity to help moms feed their kids well, but also to shape them to have a healthy relationship with food throughout their lives. Today, you can find a whole freezer door full of new, mom-focused snacks in Target stores nationwide."

Referred to as the maximum earning potential (MEP), the highest international package offered this year stood at $153,568 against $110,284 a year ago. The highest domestic package, however, fell 10 per cent, according to the audited placement report released by IIM-A on Wednesday. The final placements at IIM-A, held in February this year, saw 383 PGP students along with 46 PGP-ABM (postgraduate programme in agribusiness management) and 67 PGPX (postgraduate programme for management executives) students seeking placements. MEP is the sum total guaranteed cash component, maximum possible-linked variable pay and all other components of salary that are a part of the offer. This can include long-term compensation such as provident fund and other perks as well. Since IIM-A began getting its placement reports audited by a third party like CRISIL and now Brickwork Ratings under the Indian Placement Reporting Standards (IPRS), which looks at standardising placement data, including salary and non-salary information. According to the latest IPRS report, domestic MEP at IIM-A fell from Rs 53 lakh (Rs 5.3 million) during final placements last year to Rs 48 lakh in 2016. Average domestic and international MEP, however, saw reversal of trends where the former rose eight per cent over the previous year while the latter fell 7.7 per cent. During the 2016 final placements held in February at IIM-A, the average domestic MEP stood at Rs 22 lakh against Rs 20 lakh (Rs 2 million) last year, while international average MEP was $73,580 compared to $79,738 in the previous year. Around 110 firms had participated in the final placements for the 2016 batch at IIM-A. In terms of sector-wise recruitments, consulting continued to lead the pack, followed by banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), online services and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), among others. The consulting sector, led by recruiters such as Accenture Strategy, Alvarez & Marsal, A T Kearney, Bain & Co, McKinsey & Co and The Boston Consulting Group recruited 108 students this year against 97 last year. Recruiters in the BFSI, FMCG and e-commerce sectors included the likes of Axis Bank, Bharti AXA, YES Bank, Hindustan Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Amazon, and Flipkart, among others. After making offers, Flipkart had later deferred the joining dates of candidates to as late as December. This triggered a scathing response by IIM-A, which however later softened its stance. Before the final placements, 108 pre-placement offers were also accepted by PGP students at IIM-A. IIM-A’s one-year programme for executives (PGPX) saw the highest and average international MEP fall by 38.26 per cent and 16.33 per cent, respectively. While international MEP fell from last year's $207,581 to $128,160 this year, the average fell from $147,119 to $120,80 for the same period. Domestic MEP for PGPX, too, fell 10.8 per cent, down from Rs 54.6 lakh last year to Rs 43.7 lakh (Rs 4.37 million) this year while the average domestic MEP rose negligibly by 1.18 per cent from Rs 28.8 lakh (Rs 2.9 million) last year to Rs 29.1 lakh this year.

Lee Murphy SHARE × Facebook Twitter Text / SMS LinkedIn Google + Email Photo by Manuel Martinez Dave Dalesandro, left, and Sam Youssef, co-owners of Jet Brite Car Wash in Carol Stream About all those new car washes in your neighborhood Can anybody turn a profit washing cars for $3, or even $4? Entrepreneurs seem to think so, as they rush to build big discount auto cleaning facilities in and around Chicago. Jet Brite Car Wash, which started in 2000 with a single shop in Addison, opened its fifth car wash, in Carol Stream, last year and is opening another in Bolingbrook by December. After that, co-owners Dave Dalesandro and Sam Youssef plan to add a location every year. The cost is imposing—the Bolingbrook outpost, complete with conveyors, is budgeted at $5 million— considering that Jet Brite charges a scant $3 for each exterior wash. "We were the first guys to drive prices down to $3 around Chicago, and we have no plans to increase that price," Dalesandro says. "Some new investors are coming into the industry with the idea of charging $5 or $6 as a base price. If so, they'll have to deal with us as competitors." Few car wash operators seem to be shrinking from that challenge. Most are bulking up by establishing more low-price, high-volume locations, with the prospect of what was once a mom-and-pop industry dominated by single wash owners morphing into chain formats. Hinsdale-based Fuller's Carwash & Car Care, which has been around since shortly after World War II, now has 16 washes, including new ones in New Lenox and Chicago's Little Village. Three more are under construction, with locations in Elgin and Montgomery due to open before Christmas. "Things have gotten crazy in this business," says Robert Fuller, a senior family member who manages the Geneva wash. "Everybody and his brother seems to want to build a car wash these days. Our goal is to beat the others to the best locations." The Fullers will have to hustle. Phillip Degeratto, owner of Buddy Bear Car Wash, opened his sixth facility, near Beverly on the South Side, in early August after opening a location in Bellwood a year ago. He's looking for more sites and so far isn't worried about the prospect of overbuilding in the sector. "If anything, the West and South sides of Chicago and nearby suburbs, where I concentrate, are underserved," says Degeratto, who charges $3.99 for a basic wash and counts on 140 cars an hour and 1,500 a day moving through his 140-foot tunnels to drive his profit. There are roughly 15,000 car washes grossing $7 billion altogether annually in the U.S., according to First Research. Eric Wulf, CEO of the International Carwash Association, based in Chicago, estimates that 600 washes have opened in each of the past two years, amounting to more new development than the industry has seen in over a decade. Attendance at his association's annual convention soared to 8,000 in May from 5,500 in 2010. The industry, Wulf says, hit a low point in the recession of 2008, when many people decided they would no longer pay the standard $10 and more for a wash, setting in motion a discounting wave. Car wash owners laid off workers, investing instead in more automated washing and drying equipment, and dropped their prices by 60 percent and more. YEP, MILLENNIALS Today it helps that millennials seem disinclined to spend their weekends washing and waxing their cars, Wulf adds. "We did a national survey in 1994 that found 48 percent of Americans went to car washes. In our latest survey that was 72 percent," he says. "As a result, this is the best period for growth this industry has ever seen." It's been a good period for suppliers, too, like AVW Equipment in Maywood, which produces everything from conveyors to chemicals and brushes. Velimir "Willie" Vidakovich, a co-owner, reports that revenue has jumped 10 percent annually for each of the past five years after falling more than 20 percent during the recession. "When we started this company in 1973, most Americans still washed their cars at home," he says. "Now we see people going not once but twice a week to get their cars washed." Nevertheless, some experts warn that supply will soon overwhelm demand. Bob Roman, a car wash consultant in Clearwater, Fla., estimates that the best facilities wash 100,000 cars a year or more and gross $1 million. From that, they might net $150,000 a year in profit. But in many cities, he says, operators are no longer meeting those benchmarks. "Atlanta is already oversaturated with car washes, and the business is ruined there. The same will be coming to California," he says. "So far in Chicago, there seems to be opportunities for guys to build more washes and still make money." That hasn't escaped the attention of outsiders. The nation's biggest chain, Mister Car Wash in Tucson, Ariz., with 188 locations, has acquired three facilities in the western suburbs. Waterway Carwash of St. Louis, which has 20 locations spread between Ohio and Colorado, opened its first local wash, in Northbrook, a year ago. "We hope to have another wash open somewhere on the North Shore by next year," says CEO Robert Dubinsky. There have already been some missteps by big companies hoping to expand regionally or even nationally. Procter & Gamble opened washes around Chicago with the Mr. Clean brand more than five years ago but now has pulled back and operates in a narrow swath of Georgia. Turtle Wax, based in Willowbrook, made a big splash in opening washes featuring its products two decades ago but has ended up closing nearly all of them. Still, Jet Brite's Dalesandro expects more big money to enter the industry. "Every attempt to build a national car wash chain in the past has failed," he says. "Now the business is becoming so automated that eventually we'll see a Wall Street group figure out how to do it, and they'll build the first publicly traded car wash company. The industry will only get bigger from here on." Economy and Economic Development Small Business Transportation Automobiles News Today's Crain's Get our daily roundup of important business news.

Guest TML: There's a lot to love about area sports DJ Hodge, Guest Hemingway 8:30 a.m. EDT September 9, 2016 Elder High School’s The Pit. (Photo: Provided/JP Owens) I love this Region.  I’m a life-long Northern Kentuckian / Greater Cincinnatian, and as such, have developed a deeply rooted pride in our fantastic community.  I’m blessed to have moved here when I was two from Paducah, KY, I love raising my kids here, and I truly love this Region. I love the Bengals. Since I can remember, I have loved everything about the Bengals.  Riverfront Stadium, Kenny Anderson, Ken Riley, and the rest of my late 70’s memories, I was a fan early on.  I’m not one of the 1.4 million people to claim to have been to the Freezer Bowl, but as an 11-year-old, I remember watching that game like it was yesterday.  The 80’s were awesome…book-ended by two Super Bowl losses to the 49ers.  Boomer, James Brooks, Pete Johnson, and of course, Sam Wyche’s infamous “ you don’t live in Cleveland” speech.  I feel bad for a generation of Bengals’ fans that grew up with the 90’s Bengals and didn’t know the beauty of the 80’s version.  That said, I still loved the 90’s version, Jeff Blake, Carl Pickens, and of course, the Corey Dillon era.  They may have been the “Bungles” for a better part of the decade, but they were still my team.  The Marvin Lewis era, while obviously known a great deal for the lack of a post-season win, still has been mostly very good.  To put it in perspective, my 11-year-old son said to me during the Jacksonville Sunday Night game, “…Dad, isn’t it cool how the Bengals are always good…”.  Can you imagine?  Like many, I’m super excited about this year’s team, in spite of having no Burfict and no Eifert to start the year, along with a brutally tough first six games.  I can’t wait for Sunday vs. the Jets.  I’m oscillating between 9-7 and 10-6, but we’ll obviously have a much better idea when we get to week 7.  Who Dey! I love the Reds. The Big Red Machine!  That was my introduction to professional baseball.  I, like tens of thousands of others, grew up in the 70’s playing knothole baseball, selling Kids’ Glove tickets to see a practice game with the Tigers, and idolizing one or all of the Big Red Machine.  For me, while I loved them all, Davey Concepcion was my guy.  I was a shortstop, as much as you’re anything when you’re 10, and #13 was my hero.  I, as a Catholic, made the sign of the cross before every AB just like my guy.  I remember the 1979 NLCS like it was played this weekend.  My grandfather (Pop) and I attended the first two games of the series against the “We Are Family” version of the Pittsburgh Pirates.  I didn’t hate the Pirates; how could you with Omar Moreno, Dave Parker, and Willie Stargell playing for them.  I cried both nights in the car on the way home after the Reds lost.  I remember holding my ticket from the game after Game #2 in the car (remember when the tickets at Riverfront were the same color as the seats?) and thinking that my life was over because the Reds lost a 2nd straight playoff game.  Man, the problems you have to face when you’re 9.   The Reds, from then until now, have held a very special place in my heart – and they always will.  I was at the ballpark yesterday afternoon, the sun shining, and even with a less-than-capacity crowd in the yard, it was still majestic.  Wins and losses have MUCH less impact on me now, obviously, but the trip to the park is just as powerful.  Go Redlegs! I love College Basketball. If you told me I was going to have to live on a deserted island, and I could only watch one sport the rest of my life, it would be College Hoops.  I don’t think this region gets nearly enough credit for being the Mecca of College Hoops that it is.  I realize Tobacco Road has two storied and Top 5 programs a few miles apart, but it can’t compare to what we have in this region.  Not only are we blessed with Xavier, Cincinnati, Miami, and NKU in our back-yard, but we are a very short drive away from Dayton, Wright State, Indiana, Ohio State, Ohio University, The University of Louisville, and the University of Kentucky.  It is incredible to think about.  Not only the teams, but think of the Conferences that are included in that bunch:  the SEC, the Big 10, the Big East, the AAC (and hopefully, the Big 12), the MAC, the Horizon League, the Atlantic 10, and the ACC.  You can potentially be at Villanova at Xavier one night, Florida at Kentucky the next, Duke at Louisville the following, and then UCONN at UC the next.  Huge national games, all played within a distance you can head down and back for on a school night.  I love the Skyline Crosstown Shootout, ugly brawl and all, and love how a city so unified in so many things (Reds, Bengals, chili, high schools, regional pride, etc.), becomes so passionately divided for a couple of days.  I love the NCAA Tournament, my favorite few weeks of the year from a sports-perspective, and I love when our Regional Teams (and their rabid fan-bases) get to hang around for a couple of weeks.  I love the personalities that are and have been part of the college basketball landscape for our market:  Kenny Shields, Bob Huggins, Mick Cronin, the late Skip Prosser, Thad Matta, Sean Miller, Chris Mack, and the late Charlie Coles.  Regardless of fan affiliation, I could sit and listen to those guys talk hoops and life until the sun comes up.  We are about two months away from the squeaks of sneakers at our local arenas and I can’t wait! I love College Football. Late-summer and fall Saturdays are some of the best days of the year….that goes without saying.  The pageantry and passion around college football is unmatched.  While we don’t have the same cradle of success in this region surrounding our college football programs (Ohio State notwithstanding), it is such a national sport that it doesn’t really matter.  Like many / most of you, when the schedule allows, I start my Saturday with Herbie and the ESPN guys on Gameday, then some game at Noon from the Big 10, a 3:30 monster tilt from the SEC, a prime-time game from any of the Power 5 Conferences, and a late night Pac 12 game that I both care nothing about, and yet can’t quite pull myself away from to go to bed.  I don’t root for a single SEC team, but yet, identify with that as my most-watched league due to the tradition, the excellence (primarily of Alabama, but certainly others have taken their turn being fantastic), the passion amongst their fan-bases, the tail-gating (I’ve been to 8 SEC stadiums and each are spectacular in many ways two to three hours before kick-off…well, except you Vandy), the coaches, the personalities, and the style of play.   I can watch about any SEC game, with no dog in the fight, and be thoroughly entertained.  I love the BIG games in the Big 10.  Nebraska vs Michigan State, Penn State vs Iowa, and of course, the greatest rivalry in College Football,  Michigan vs Ohio State, and any other mixture of those teams.  The wide-open nature of the Big 12 and the Pac 12, the traditions of Clemson and Florida State, the Petrino era, take II, at Louisville…I find it all incredibly compelling.  A sold-out Nippert for a big night game…man…there is little as cool as that.  College Football doesn’t get the attention in this region, by and large, that College Hoops does, but I’m a huge fan and I know I’m not alone. Yes, I love High School Sports. I can’t claim to be from here if I don’t acknowledge just how much I enjoy high school sports, even though I don’t currently have any skin-in-the-game, as they say.  I’m a proud Graduate of Covington Catholic, and as often as you’ll find my son and I (and my daughter if I can bribe her effectively) at a CovCath football, basketball, or soccer game, you’ll also likely find us at other big games around the area.  I’m a sucker for the rivalries that exist in our area, and how otherwise normal business people will get so crazy talking about an “Elder Friday” or the glory days of their H.S. careers.  I love the passion, on the field and in the stands, of a good high school football or basketball game.  I love the intensity around a St. Xavier vs Colerain game, or Moeller and Elder at the Pit, or Elder and LaSalle, or Mason and Lakota West, or Anderson and Turpin.   While the best rivalry in Northern KY is unquestionably Highlands and CovCath (yes, it is still a rivalry despite one team dominating the other in recent memory), there are other great ones like Beechwood and NewCath, Cooper and Ryle, Boone Co. and Conner, and Simon Kenton and Ryle.  Beyond football, this area is blessed with  great High School basketball, including the recent run under Scott Ruthsatz at my Alma Mater (with much credit given to his outstanding staff the last few years with Tony Bacigalupo, Matt Otte (congrats Matt on getting the head job at Conner; good luck!), Brandon Elliott, and Cincinnati H.S. hoops legend Joe Fredrick), but also what Carl Kremer has done at Moeller, Coach Fleming at LaSalle, and the iconic Mike Price at Oak Hills; it is all fun to watch.  I know there are thousands of transplants reading this at P&G, Kroger, and the like that are rolling their eyes and muttering, “…these folks from here, so weird about their high school stuff…”, but sorry (not sorry).  One of the great things about a community where so many choose to stay and raise their kids where they grew up is we all know each other, we have commonalities, and it helps us understand each other.  Friday nights in this town, be it in Fort Thomas, Anderson, West Chester, Hamilton, Colerain, or the West Side, will always be filled with cheers, burgers on a grill, cheerleaders, proud parents, and young men playing their guts out on the field.  And I love that. I love this Region. I’ve known my friend Paul Daugherty for a long-time, and I’ve both wanted and feared being a guest TML’er for several years, but when I recently saw Paul at a Mack Family Foundation event at the home of Chris and Christi Mack, we finally settled on a date.  Sometime after that, it dawned on me what I had committed to.  I’m not Mo Egger or Lance McAllister, two brilliant guys, and good friends, who do this for a living and are incredible at what they do.  I’m no Dan Hoard, one of the finest humans you’ll ever meet who can make every game he calls sound like the best place in the world to be.  However, with all the things I’m not, I hope this at least brought back a few memories, made you smile a time or two, and reminded you just how blessed you are to either be from here, or to live here; or in my case, both.  I can be found on Twitter at @XSP4 if you’re interested in such things.  Have a great weekend – WHO DEY!
