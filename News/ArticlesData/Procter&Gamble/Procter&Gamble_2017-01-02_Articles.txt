The Yoga Guru's company has clocked 146 percent growth in the current fiscal and is today the biggest disruptive force in India's market, according to a major industry body. "Patanjali Ayurved has turned out to be the most disruptive force in the Indian FMCG market… it witnessed a whopping annual growth of 146 percent in fiscal 2016 grossing a turnover of $ 769 million. Its established peers including ITC, Dabur, Hindustan Unilever, Colgate–Palmolive and Procter & Gamble have struggled to post double-digit growth," noted a Assocham–TechSci research report quoted by the Press Trust of India. Since its inception as a traditional Indian medicine company, Patanjali Ayurved has diversified into food items and cosmetics. These were till then dominated by products of western companies such as Proctor & Gamble, Unilever and Nestle. The increasing demand for Patanjali products has resulted in smaller outlets opening at almost everywhere. "Initially, the company focused only on the development of Ayurvedic medicines, but gradually started manufacturing food items and cosmetics… With around 500 products, many of them in the FMCG category, the company has significantly increased its market share. Many of its product launches have impacted share of other FMCG companies in that product category." Patanjali Ayurved's toothpaste has eaten into the market share of established brands such as Colgate, Close-up, Pepsodent etc. In fact, the US-based Colgate-Palmolive, which still controls 55 per cent of the oral care market in India has reportedly lost nearly 1.5 percent of its market share to Dant Kanti in recent months. To counter Patanjali's inroads, the American brand has launched a herbal ayurvedic toothpaste. © AFP 2016/ Antara Foto/Nova Wahyudi Palm Oil Stains: Child Labor Used in Supply Chains by Big Glossy BrandsThe company's vice-president Bina Thompson had in August 2016 defended the move during an investor meeting. She was quoted as saying, "In India, the consumer believes strongly in natural ingredients. The positioning is a toothpaste packed with the goodness of natural ingredients to help keep dental problems away." Not only that, Patanjali Ayurved's product offering in noodles segment is giving tough competition to Switzerland-based Nestle's Maggi, which in November had a market share of 57 percent. Before June 2015 when Maggi was handed a five-month ban, it enjoyed a whopping 75 percent market share in the noodles segment. Patanjali Ayurved is aiming to become a $2.9 billion brand by 2020.And most market watchers are optimistic on that. So what makes the brand tick? "The biggest appeal for Patanjali users is its association with Baba Ramdev who has become the biggest brand ambassador of promoting health through yoga and traditional Indian ayurvedic herbs and medicines. In addition, the product offerings are decent in standard backed by competitive prices," said Satish Kumar, a franchise owner of a Patanjali Ayurved store in Dwarka, an upscale area of southwest Delhi. The rise of Patanjali Ayurved has come along with intense regulatory scrutiny and interest by rivals. Last month, the company was fined INR 1.1 million for misbranding and putting up misleading advertisements of its products. The brand has also been criticized for producing advertisements "unfairly denigrating" products manufactured by its competitors. ...

In 2013, she had a rough start in her senior level where she faltered far too many times at the U.S. Secret Classic which determines who will move on to the P&G Championships formerly known as simply the Nationals. She fell on her head on floor exercise, touched the beam along with many major mistakes throughout the routine and fell off uneven bars on a very common release move called the Tkatchev. After the disastrous meet and receiving close attention from coordinator Martha Karolyi, she would go on to win virtually everything in sight and led the 2016 U.S. Women's Gymnastics team to a third team gold medal, second consecutive, with astronomical numbers. Simone Biles went into 2016 as the female gymnast to beat. Over the previous three years, she won three consecutive World Championship titles along with many individual events. In all, Biles had won 14 World Championship medals, ten of them gold. That made her the most decorated World's female gymnast and put her in the position to sweep events held in 2016. In June, Biles began her trek to being one step closer to the 2016 Olympic Games. During the P&G Championships, she went into day 2 of competition with a 2.45 lead over the next competitor. By the end of the meet, she made U.S. history becoming the only female gymnast to have won four consecutive national titles. Joan Moore Gnat achieved a similar feat between 1971 and 1974 but two of those were shared titles. She left the competition as the winner with a 62.900, 3.9 points ahead of second place winner Aly Raisman. The one-two positions would carry on into the Games. Next up was the Olympic Trials. Since Martha Karolyi had taken over the U.S. program, the rules changed as to how gymnasts are selected to go to the worldwide stage. No longer has it been a combination of nationals and trials scores, but athletes were strategically chosen by the selection committee to fill the few spots on each event for team competition--who would be the strongest on each event. Though she took a fall on balance beam, a full point deduction, she secured the only guaranteed spot on the team earning 123.25 over two days of competition. First year senior Laurie Hernandez made her statement coming in second with 121.15. The committee took their time lasting roughly 30 minutes choosing Biles, Aly Raisman, Madison Kocian, Gabby Douglas and Laurie Hernandez. Finally, the Rio Games had arrived. Biles was of course the one to beat. During the qualifications round, Team USA left the competition with 185.238 points having a 10 point lead over the People's Republic of China. Qualifications determines the rest of the competition in all events. Biles and Aly Raisman would move on to the All-Around, Raisman having missed out on a medal in 2012. Biles would also move on to vault, balance beam and floor exercise, the latter being her most explosive with a move named after her (a double layout with a half twist out). During team finals, Biles' routines with high difficulty and start values helped the team win its third gold medal. The U.S. women scored 184.897 and had an 8.209 lead over the Russians. They dubbed themselves "The Final Five" and will go down in gymnastics history as the best female team. It was then the All-Around finals where Biles was more than expected to win. She and teammate Aly Raisman fought hard and Raisman accepted that if she came in second it would be like winning gold because Biles is in a league of her own. Routine after routine, when floor exercise came it was all but certain Biles and Raisman would take a one-two position. Raisman's FX is perhaps one of the most difficult in the world and she nailed pass after pass, crying coming off the floor knowing she would medal this Olympiad. It came down to Biles, the final performance of the night on FX where she smiled knowing she had it in the bag. At the end, her 15.933 score secured her victory and a rare moment of Biles in tears lit up the heart's of gymnastics lovers around the world. She finished with 62.198 while Raisman scored 60.098. Ending with individual events, Biles took home gold on vault while making a mistake that cost her the gold on balance beam. Biles touched the beam on a punch front and she finished with a bronze medal. Moving to her best event, Biles and Raisman took another one-two on floor exercise. By the end of the Olympic Games, Biles took home four gold and one bronze. If she and Raisman continue to the 2020 Tokyo Games, each would need just one medal to be the most decorated Olympic female gymnasts of all time. They each tie with 1992 and 1996 gold medalist Shannon Miller. Following the Olympic Games, Simone Biles had many appearances before going on the Kellogg's Tour, an exhibition after each Olympiad. She appeared in Jake Miller's music video as her love interest and released the book "Courage to Soar: A Body in Motion, A Life in Balance" with the forward by 1984 champ Mary Lou Retton. On December 26, Biles was named the AP Female Athlete of the Year becoming only the fifth gymnast to receive the honor. Voted by U.S. editors and news directors, Biles took the year-end honor with swimmer Katie Ledecky and tennis great Serena Williams following.

We've seen that simply getting into the market can be the most important investment decision you'll ever make. So today I want to show you an investment tactic that's going to get you into "primo" stocks… without having to pay primo prices. And even better, you'll never have to deal with a single broker (who'll charge you primo prices). And best of all, these stocks, and the plan I'm going to show you to use with them, are going to boost your income like nothing else in this market will… The Most Powerful Wealth Builders Available I'm talking about DRIPs – or dividend reinvestment plans. Now, that might sound like a leaky faucet, but they're actually a great way to turn a small amount of money into the sort of retirement-boosting savings you've always longed for. You see, one of the lessons I've learned about this business over the years is that there's no better way to grow real wealth than to systematically invest in high-quality stocks – and hold on for the long haul. That's why DRIPs are such powerful wealth-builders. Don't let the name fool you – DRIPs go way beyond the average dividend-paying stock purchase. The real beauty comes from the added perks. By plowing your dividends back into more shares, DRIPs make it easy to harness the power of "compounding" – taking a smidgeon of capital and putting it to work. So I've put together a list of five DRIP stocks that will kick-start your long-term wealth for pennies on the dollar. But before I show you how DRIP investing can turbocharge your wealth down the road, let's take a look at how this wealth-building strategy works. It's extremely simple… DRIPs 101: Building Wealth One Share at a Time DRIP investing is an easy way for investors to get started buying shares in one company at a time by allowing them to invest directly in that company instead of through a traditional or online broker. For first-time investors who may be timid about getting into the market, DRIP stocks can be a great learning tool. The best DRIP programs are often offered by companies with strong dividend payout histories – the ones that cater to long-term investors who tend to stick with stocks. Most DRIPs let investors reinvest all dividends into more shares of a company, at little or no cost. This is crucial. Let's say you're able to invest $5,000 per year. Although that doesn't seem like much, thanks to the magic of compounded dividends, that $5,000 annual investment could turn to nearly $5 million over time. Assuming a $100 share price in a given company, if you started out Year One with an investment of 50 shares, by the end of a 30-year period, you'd have a nice nest egg of 49,736 shares worth nearly $5 million. Even better, at Year 31, those shares would be throwing off more than $910,000 in cash dividends every year. For investors without much "seed money," keeping costs to a minimum is crucial. So it's nice to know that when it comes to keeping broker fees and commissions low, it doesn't get much better than DRIPs. DRIP plans provide investors a compelling way to invest amounts as small as $50 to $100 per month free of charge and build positions in high-quality stocks for the long haul. And being in for the long haul is important – these plans are not for quick-draw traders who want to make quick cash in the market. So how do you know if a company offers a DRIP plan? More than 1,100 companies offer DRIPs. To find out if a company offers a DRIP program, all you have to do is check out their website or, if you want a more comprehensive list, go to Computershare. There you'll find A-list names like American Express Co. (NYSE: AXP), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), The Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO), and Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT), just to name a few. It's important to remember, especially in volatile times like we've seen in 2016, DRIPs can be a nice way to smooth out purchases. You see, DRIPs take the guessing game out of investing. Here's what I mean… An Easy Way to Do Dollar-Cost Averaging One of the key benefits of DRIPs is that they take emotion out of the equation. Instead of dropping a large sum into a stock all at once and hoping you got a great price, you keep buying the stock on the same date each month, regardless of the price. If the market continues to fall, your average price goes lower. If the market climbs, you started with a nice little discount, and regardless of what the price is today, you'll be coming out ahead down the road. If the price of the stock you're reinvesting in is high, your dividends automatically buy fewer shares. If the price of the stock you're reinvesting in is low, your dividends automatically buy more shares. So you see, by investing in DRIPs, investors can be more aggressive when prices are low and more conservative when they are high. In the long run, your average price will balance itself out. Most companies that offer DRIPs will allow you to buy extra shares directly, again cutting out the broker middleman. If this all sounds familiar, that's because it's not a new idea. Think of your 401(k): a little bit of money gets whisked away to buy shares of different funds each month. Do you miss that money? Probably not. Does it add up over time? You bet it does. The only difference with DRIPs is that you're buying shares and building positions in individual companies. Now that you know a little more about how DRIPs work, let's take a look at five blue-chip companies that every investor should use in their DRIP strategy. DRIP Investment No. 1: Abbott Laboratories As one of the world's largest producers of prescription drugs, diagnostic tests, nutrition and vision care products, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) is a pharmaceutical titan. With a market cap of $55 billion, Abbott has consistently raised its dividend for 44 years and serves customers in more than 150 countries. Recently, this 125-year-old firm made headlines when it solidified its bid to acquire device maker St. Jude Medical Inc. in a cash and stock deal valued at $25 billion. Abbott CEO Miles White said on a conference call that St. Jude's "highly competitive" portfolio of devices will help the combined company reduce healthcare costs and improve outcomes for patients. "Together we will compete in nearly every area of the cardiovascular device market," he said. The deal is expected to propel Abbott's cardiovascular device unit to nearly $8.7 billion annually – a market that Abbott estimates will top $30 billion by 2017. Abbott has been in business for more than a century – a testament to its nose for marketing and brand building. DRIP Investment No. 2: Exxon Mobil Corp. Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM), the largest publicly traded oil company on Earth, is also one of the very best DRIP stocks. Despite crude oil's wild ride in 2016, Exxon's stock has held up much better than the rest oil's "Seven Sisters" superpowers. In fact, while Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX), BP Plc. (NYSE ADR: BP) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (NYSE ADR: RDS.A) have all come under fire from analysts scrutinizing the safety of their dividend, Exxon has gained nearly 23% since the start of the year. That's because this juggernaut has steady refinery and chemicals manufacturing profits that have covered many of the losses from its upstream business. If you want to add Exxon to your DRIP plan today, you can pick this crude oil powerhouse up for 1.5 times sales, allowing you to increasingly claim your stake for a bargain price. The added bonus: The stock is yielding a 3.4% dividend, which Exxon will happily plow back into your DRIP account in the form of brand-new stock purchases, for free every quarter. DRIP Investment No. 3: Proctor & Gamble Co. Founded in 1837, Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) is a historic company with more than 178 years of phenomenal sales. With no fewer than 21 brands and sales of over $70 billion annually, products in over 180 countries, and 59 consecutive years of dividend increases, this is a firm all investors should take a look at. Consumers currently buy this home-goods giant's products more than 40 billion times a year. The company's unique growth story stems from its focus on low-tech disposable products – laundry detergent, shampoo, razor blades, toilet paper, toothpaste, and paper towels. In other words, stuff we can't do without. Procter & Gamble supports its portfolio of brands with huge amounts of spending on advertising. Its product lines include Febreze, Crest, Gillette, Head & Shoulders, Downy, Tide, and Pampers. The company spends $8 billion to $9 billion a year on advertising. That buys it tremendous product awareness that smaller competitors simply can't match. The stock currently yields an impressive 3.24% dividend. DRIP Investment No. 4: Becton, Dickinson & Co. In 1897, traveling salesmen Maxwell Becton and Fairleigh Dickinson founded this company. With nearly 30,000 employees and a market cap of $35 billion, Becton, Dickinson & Co. (NYSE: BDX) develops diagnostic and analytic systems (such as blood tests) and cutting-edge bioscience solutions (such as kits for cell analysis). In 1906, Becton Dickinson built its first manufacturing facility in the United States specifically designed for thermometers, hypodermic needles, and syringes. Today, Becton Dickinson is a global company, with about 60% of its more than $10 billion in annual sales coming from outside the United States. The company's competitive advantage lies in its global reach, strong supply lines, and well-established relationships with customers and governments. Becton Dickinson has a long history of innovation. The company's ability to generate revenue from new products and market them through its established distribution network fuels nonstop growth. Becton Dickinson's sales and profits have continued to rise every year, and the firm has increased its dividend payments for 43 consecutive years and now yields 1.72%. DRIP Investment No. 5: Chubb Ltd. Chubb Ltd. (NYSE: CB), one of the oldest insurance companies in North America, is the fifth-largest publicly traded property and casualty insurer in the United States. Founded in 1882, this firm has grown its dividend payments for 33 consecutive years. Chubb sells home, car, business, and supplemental health insurance policies through its network of independent agents and brokers located in North and South America, Australia, Europe, and Asia. The core concept of insurance has not changed much in the last 400 years, and it's not about to change anytime soon. Technology like Big Data only make calculating insurance risks easier. Chubb merged with ACE Ltd. in July 2015, and the two companies agreed to operate under the Chubb name. Combined, the companies, now based in Switzerland, have shareholder equity of nearly $46 billion and cash, investments, and other assets of $150 billion. Chubb distributes its products through 8,000 independent agents and brokers in 120 offices across the United States and in more than 25 countries. Turn on the Faucet and Let It DRIP The bottom line here is that while all investments are subject to risk, investing in a solid DRIP program has historically been a recipe for success. And it's one more "getting started" investing tactic you can add to the ones I've been sharing with you since March. Don't forget that a DRIP account requires a little legwork on your part. Make sure you research every company that you want to invest in before you buy. But for those who are willing to play the long game, DRIPs could be your ticket to lifelong wealth.

(AP) — The total value of the Tampa Bay area's housing stock soared 10.3 percent in 2016, nearly twice as much than the nation as a whole, according to a new report from Zillow. The Tampa Bay Times reports (http://bit.ly/2hKnsmB) that dollar-wise, bay-area homes collectively exceed the market value of such giants as Bank of America, Procter & Gamble, Disney and Coca-Cola. If they all sold tomorrow, they'd bring in more money than the annual revenues of every Fortune 500 company except Walmart. On the downside, Tampa Bay housing values still haven't returned to pre-crash levels. And in another sign of the lingering effects of the foreclosure crisis, the large number of bay area residents who lease rather than own is spurring a hefty increase in rental rates. ___ Information from: Tampa Bay Times (St. Petersburg, Fla.), http://www.tampabay.com.

Nevertheless, many private companies and government agencies have been working on research and development to make plan-based plastics packaging more established. Plant-based plastic are made from agricultural waste, sugar cane, switch grass or grasses and corn. Moreover, manufacturers are using plant-based oil in plant-based plastic packaging for processing plastic instead of using petrochemicals in order to make it more environmental friendly. Get Sample Report Copy: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… Plant-based plastic packaging helps to reduce greenhouse gases by up to 35% and takes up to 36% less energy to make as compared to conventional plastic packages. Several products are being launched in the global plant-based plastic packaging market. For instance, in April 2011, P&G (currently acquired by Coty Inc.) introduced its range of shampoos under the brand name Pantene rapped with plant-based plastic packaging. Coca Cola Company is another example of switching to plant-based plastic packing from traditional packaging. The company is focused to convert all the Coca Cola packaging made of plant-based by 2020 as per its green initiative plan. Nevertheless, AT&T uses packaging that contains 30% plant-based materials sourced from sugarcane ethanol. Also, partnerships ramp up in the global plant-based plastic packaging market to meet the increasing demand for plant-based plastics packaging from the end user industries. For instance, in August 2016, Canada-based Solegear Bioplastic Technologies Inc. and r-pac International, a leading global supplier of retail packaging introduced plant-based packaging for leading smartphone case. Plant-based plastic packaging costs six to seven times more than conventional plastics.

North American plant-based plastic regulations for the North American manufactures and increasing adoption of plant-based plastic packaging in the U.S. are the key factors responsible for the growth of plant-based plastic packaging industry in North America. North America is expected to be the fastest growing market and is expected to grow at double digit CAGR during the forecast period 2016-2024 attributable to the increasing size and high market share investments made by the global giants in the region.

Also, huge demand generated from giant end user companies including Coca-Cola Co., Ford Motor Co., H.J. Heinz Co. and Nike Inc. is another driving factor for the global plant-based plastic packaging market to increase the revenue.

After a gap of over 20 years, Re 1 note has been released in the country. Let's get to know our currency better. Here are some of the most amazing, lesser-known facts about the Indian rupee: 2/25 SLIDES © REUTERS/Anindito Mukherjee 1) First paper currency The process of issuing paper currency started in the 18th century. Private banks like Bank of Hindustan, Bank of Bengal, the Bank of Bombay, and the Bank of Madras were among the first to print paper money.  It was only after the Paper Currency Act of 1861 that the government of India was given the monopoly to print currency. (Image: One of the first Indian bank one rupee note printed in 1917) 3/25 SLIDES © RBI site 2) The highest denomination note ever printed by the RBI was the Rs 10,000 note in 1938 and again in 1954. These notes were demonetized in 1946 and again in 1978. 4/25 SLIDES © RBI 3) The RBI can issue banknotes in the denominations of 5000 and 10,000, or any other denomination that the Central Government may specify. But, there can't be banknotes in denominations higher than 10,000 as per the current provisions of the RBI Act, 1934. 5/25 SLIDES © REX Features 4) What's the rupee made of? Not paper! Your currency is composed of cotton and cotton rag. 6/25 SLIDES © Samuel Bourne/Spencer Arnold/Hulton Archive/Getty Images 5) Commemorative coins in India have been issued on various occasions. The first 75 rupee coin was issued in 2010 to celebrate 75 years of Reserve Bank of India. In 2011, 150 rupee coins were issued to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore.   The first 1000 rupee coin was announced in 2012, issued to commemorate the 1000 years of Brihadeeswarar temple in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu. 7/25 SLIDES © AP Photo/Bikas Das 6) Coins can be issued up to the denomination of Rs. 1000 as per Coinage Act, 2011. 8/25 SLIDES © AP Photo/Ajit Solanki 7) 15 languages appear in the language panel of banknotes in addition to Hindi prominently displayed in the centre of the note and English on the reverse of the banknote. 9/25 SLIDES © AP Photo 8) Rupee symbol In 2010, rupee got a new symbol ₹, designed by D.Udaya Kumar. The symbol was derived from Devanagari letter "र" (ra) and is a combination of the Latin letter 'R' and Devanagari letter 'र'. The parallel line in the symbol is drawn to make it look like the tricolor of the Indian national flag. 10/25 SLIDES   9) For the visually impaired There is an identification mark (different geometrical shapes) on the left hand side of each note in the form of raised print (intaglio) - a diamond for Rs 1000, circle for Rs 500, triangle for Rs 100, square for Rs 50, rectangle for Rs 20 and none for Rs 10 - to help the visually impaired identify the denomination.  11/25 SLIDES © AP Photo/Bikas Das 10) Mystery of the vanishing rupee In 2007, an acute shortage of coins gripped the eastern Indian city of Calcutta, which saw shopkeepers begging change from beggars and buying coins at prices above their face value. (Image: A woman selling stacks of 100 rupee coins (USD$ 2.5) for 120 rupees (UDS$ 3), counts notes at a bus stand in Calcutta, India Friday, June 15, 2007) 12/25 SLIDES   11) When Re 1 coin was worth Rs 5 One reason cited for this acute shortage in Calcutta was: coins being melted down and smuggled to Bangladesh where they were turned into razor blades, ornaments, fountain pen nibs, metal idols. The one rupee coin was actually worth Rs 35, for every single rupee coin was being melted into 5-7 blades, as per new reports. 13/25 SLIDES © Sanjit Das/Bloomberg 12) Cardboard tokens as coins To counter the coin shortage in the East, workers in tea gardens in states bordering Bangladesh, were encouraged by the owners to accept brown-coloured cardboard tokens instead of the metallic coins. The cardboard tokens were made of the same size as the coins they meant to represent, with similar values marked on them.  14/25 SLIDES © AP Photo 13) Rupee vs dollar in 1947 The 'fact' that had been floating around that the rupee was equal to a US dollar in 1947 is but a myth. At the time of independence (and till 1966), India’s currency was pegged to British pound, (and the exchange rate was Rs 13.33 to the pound). The pound itself was pegged to $4.03. That means, the $ to INR rate would be somewhere around Rs 4. 15/25 SLIDES © Adeel Halim/Bloomberg 14) Notes are printed at four printing presses located at Nashik, Dewas, Mysore and Salboni. Coins are minted at the four mints at Mumbai, Noida, Kolkata and Hyderabad. 16/25 SLIDES © Adeel Halim/Bloomberg 15) Each mint carries its unique identifier shape/sign at the bottom of the coin (beneath the year). Delhi mint - dot Mumbai mint - diamond Hyderabad mint - star Kolkata mint - No mint mark 17/25 SLIDES © RBI 16) A rare 5-rupee note, dated January 5, 1916, issued by the Government of India in Karachi was sold for £3,100 ($5,297 U.S.) in a London auction conducted by Spink last year. (Source: Spink) Karachi was then part of India, until 1947. 18/25 SLIDES © ANINDITO MUKHERJEE/epa/Corbi 17) During the British rule, and the first decade of independence, the rupee was divided into 16 annas. Each anna was subdivided into 4 paisas. In 1957, decimalisation occurred and the rupee was divided into 100 naye paise (Hindi/Urdu for new paisas). After a few years, the initial "naye" was dropped. 19/25 SLIDES © RBI 18) The Rs 5-note was the first paper currency issued by RBI in January 1938. It had the portrait of King George VI. 20/25 SLIDES © REUTERS/Anindito Mukherjee 19) Initially, Pakistan used British Indian coins and notes simply over-stamped with "Pakistan". New coins and banknotes were issued in 1948. 21/25 SLIDES © AP Photo/Biswaranjan Rout 20) The 500 rupee note was introduced in 1987 and 1000 rupee note in 2000. 22/25 SLIDES © Thom Lang/Corbis 21) A one-rupee coin and above can be used to pay/settle any amount or sum. However, a 50 paise coin cannot be used to pay/settle any amount above Rs 10. 23/25 SLIDES © SANJEEV GUPTA/epa/Corbis 22) Ever wondered how the old notes are destroyed? According to the data obtained by RTI activist Manoranjan Roy, 11,661 crore notes lost their usable value (between 2001 and now) and were shredded to bits, to be later balled or gummed together, and be reborn as coasters, paper-weights, pen stands, key chains. In 2010-11 alone, 1,385 crore notes worth Rs 1,78,830 crore were destroyed. 24/25 SLIDES © AP Photo/Rafiq Maqbool 23) In 2013, a Mumbai-based jewelry chain launched Sachin Tendulkar gold and silver coins on the occasion of 'Akshay Tritya.' The cost of a 10-gm was Rs 34,000 (US$620) (Image above) In 2014, Britain’s premium luxury goods brand East India Company issued an exclusive legal tender gold coin worth 12,000 pound sterling (about Rs 12 lakh) in honour of Sachin Tendulkar. 25/25 SLIDES © REX/Courtesy Everett Collection 24) The tooled one rupee coin (with the portrait of King George VI, i.e., the Head on both the sides) in the 1975-cult classic 'Sholay', was bought by a Bollywood fan for Rs 26000 at an auction last year.  25/25 SLIDES The paper said India is also emerging as a strong regional export hub for the domestic and multinational FMCG players leveraging the countrys cost competitivenes. In 2015, the total Indian FMCG market was USD 43 billion of which 60 per cent is concentrated in urban areas while the rest is in the rural areas.  ALSO ON MSN: Patanjali denim?

LUIS SANTANA | Times Happy New Year, Tampa Bay — you're worth more than you used to be. Related News/Archive Which Tampa Bay neighborhood home values will rise most this year? The answer may surprise you. 1 Week Ago Michigan man offers a cautionary tale about renting Tampa Bay properties on Craigslist 3 Weeks Ago Health Insurance Innovations and WellCare are among the top Tampa Bay stocks of 2016 2 Weeks Ago In the year just ended, the total value of the bay area's housing stock soared 10.3 percent, nearly twice as much than the nation as a whole, according to a new report from Zillow. Dollar-wise, bay-area homes collectively exceed the market value of such giants as Bank of America, Procter & Gamble, Disney and Coca-Cola. If they all sold tomorrow, they'd bring in more money than the annual revenues of every Fortune 500 company except Walmart. On the downside, Tampa Bay housing values still haven't returned to pre-crash levels. And in another sign of the lingering effects of the foreclosure crisis, the large number of bay area residents who lease rather than own is spurring a hefty increase in rental rates. Zillow based its home value and rent report on an analysis of 536 U.S. metro areas. Overall, 2016 was a very good year for home ownership as the value of the nation's housing stock rose 5.3 percent to a record $29.6 trillion. That's more than the gross domestic product of the United States and China combined. "Housing is incredibly important to us personally and to the economy as a whole,'' said Svenja Gudell, Zillow's chief economist. "The U.S. housing stock is worth more than ever, which is a sign of the ongoing housing recovery. As buying a home gets more expensive, affordability remains a concern for many, and these numbers highlight just how much people are spending on housing.'' Related: How long can the good times roll for Tampa Bay's housing market for the bubble pops? Florida Realtors reported last month that the median price of single-family homes in the four-county Tampa Bay area soared nearly 15 percent in November to $204,900. For the area's two largest counties, Hillsborough and Pinellas, the figures were right around the $220,000 statewide median. Of the nation's total housing value, Los Angeles and New York account for the largest shares, at 8.6 percent and 8 percent, respectively, Zillow says. The next most valuable metro area is San Francisco, worth 4.2 percent of overall housing value. At the bottom end of the scale, the Raymondville metro area of south Texas was worth just slightly more than the $325 million contract awarded to Miami Marlins outfielder Giancarlo Stanton, to date the largest individual contract in sports history. While several U.S. markets are now more valuable than they were at the height of the housing bubble, about 60 percent including Tampa Bay are still below their peaks, Zillow found. Chicago, for example, remains about $134 billion shy of its all-time high. Zillow didn't give pre-crash figures for the Tampa Bay area. Its housing stock currently is worth more than that in Charlotte, San Antonio, Orlando and Austin but only about a third of that in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area. Meanwhile, Tampa Bay renters spent far more than renters in several other major metro areas. Total bay area rents rose to $5 billion last year, an 11 percent increase compared to less than 4 percent nationally. While 2017 is forecast as the year when more millennials and first-time buyers enter Florida's housing market, the high rents they now pay can make it hard to come up with down payments and closing costs. One new apartment complex in downtown St. Petersburg charges as much as $2,885 for a one-bedroom unit.

The lists were derived through scientific calculation based on the frequency of emotive words and phrases used in viewer comments. Out of nearly 8,000 video ads analyzed last year, these ads distinguished themselves by achieving the highest level of emotional impact with viewers. “One of the ground truths proven by our data again and again is that emotionally evocative ads, whether heartwarming or inspirational or humorous, are the best at grabbing viewer attention, being persuasive, and influencing in-market behavior,” said Peter Daboll, CEO of Ace Metrix. He added, “Last year was marked by intensely emotional events, and video advertising was in some ways a reflection of this. The Olympics brought many uplifting pieces of creative from brands like Hershey’s and P&G, while brands like Zappos and Microsoft tackled social issues like homelessness and female empowerment. The presidential election opened the door for brands to deliver messages of inclusion and unity. As usual, the Super Bowl brought us some of the year’s funniest ads, including Doritos final installment of Crash the Super Bowl.” “We also saw brands such as Johnsonville, Avocados from Mexico, and Kohler surprise us using innovative approaches to creating memorable ads. Operating on a highly creative plane, these brands kept viewer interest though clever dialogue and mesmerizing visuals,” said Daboll. The lists below provide a look back at the ads that moved us last year. They were ranked using multiple NLP techniques to determine emotional reaction uncovered in viewer comments. The example words and phrases below were the highest matches related to each specific emotional sentiment. The Most Inspirational Ads of 2016 – frequently occurring words and phrases include “very inspiring”, “motivating”, “empowering”, and “uplifting”: Rank   Brand   Ad Title   Ad Length 1   Nike   Unlimited Scout Bassett   2:17 2   Frosted Flakes   Making of “Let Your Gr-r-reat Out”   1:00 3   Always   #LikeAGirl Keep Playing   1:00 4   Fitbit   Love Fit: Team Hoyt   :30 5   Microsoft   What are you going to make?   1:39       The Most Heartwarming Ads of 2016 - frequently occurring words include “heartwarming”, “touching”, “emotional”, and “sentimental”: Rank   Brand   Ad Title   Ad Length 1   Hershey’s   Hello From Home: U.S. Olympic Wrestler Jordan Burroughs   2:00 2   Hallmark   Extraordinary   :30 3   Zappos   Box Home   1:49 4   Toyota   Welcome Home   :30 5   Procter & Gamble   Thank You, Mom   2:00       The Funniest Ads of 2016 - frequently occurring words and phrases include “funny”, “very funny”, “laugh out loud”, and “humorous”: Rank   Brand   Ad Title   Ad Length 1   Cheetos   The Lie Detector   :30 2   Doritos   Ultrasound   :30 3   Slim Jim   Grandma   :30 4   Slim Jim   Jim Skywriting   :30 5   Hyundai   First Date   1:00       The Most Creative Ads of 2016 - frequently occurring words include “clever”, “creative”, “witty”, and “unique”: Rank   Brand   Ad Title   Ad Length 1   Johnsonville   "Regular Speed Chase" by Brett   1:11 2   Avocados from Mexico   #AvosInSpace   1:00 3   Kohler   Never Too Next   :30 4   Audi   Duel   1:30 5   Adidas   Basketball Needs Creators, feat.

Subscribe Now Harry's, the Shaving Brand, Tells Its Whole Unlikely Story in This Fun Long-Form Ad Company tries TV for the first time By T.L. Stanley January 3, 2017, 9:45 AM EST To tell the origin story of Harry's, the shaving subscription service, co-founders Jeff Raider and Andy Katz-Mayfield will show you their baby pictures and their boxer shorts. It's their way of explaining how a couple of self-professed regular guys went through puberty, sprouted their first facial hair, felt ripped off by the cost of grooming products, launched a company and angered Big Razor in the process (as in, fielded threats to have their pants sued off). New York-based Harry's, which has used only digital and social media marketing since its founding in 2013, kicks off its first national TV campaign next week. The move follows the debut this summer of a next-generation razor and its first retail deal with Target. The documentary-style ad, from agency Partners & Spade and directors Supermarche, launches this week across YouTube, Hulu and various digital media. It stars Harry's workers, including the baritone-voiced employee No. 2 (Jon Goldmann, director of brand engagement) who serves as its narrator, and its clean-shaven co-CEOs. The mini-movie, with a dash of animation and a charming Skype call from Katz-Mayfield's proud parents, runs about two and a half minutes, with shorter versions planned for cable TV. Here's the long-form: The campaign traces Raider and Katz-Mayfield's journey from disgruntled shavers to startup mavens, complete with their purchase of a 100-year-old razor factory outside Frankfurt, Germany. "Getting people to buy into the brand based on product and technology is clearly important, but the brand is more than that," Katz-Mayfield says. "It's a set of human beings. We want to showcase our community." Harry's competes directly with Dollar Shave Club (which also has fresh ads rolling out for the new year) and the category's traditional giants, Schick and Gillette, with the latter filing and later abandoning the aforementioned lawsuit. "Our biggest challenge is letting people know we exist," says Raider, who was one of the co-founders of Warby Parker. "We're at a point in our growth where we want to invest in that. The logical place for us to start is by talking about how we got to where we are today." That involved buying a $100 million razor manufacturing plant in Eisfeld, Germany, where much of the ad was shot, and working with its vice chairman, Heinz Becker, seen in the campaign embracing his new colleagues. (The deal was considered a bit of a head-scratcher in the beginning, say Harry's execs, who were nicknamed "the American internet cowboys" by the German media.) The campaign follows the trend of humanizing a brand by using C-suite mavens, not actors or pro athletes, as spokespeople. It's a tactic that worked incredibly well for online category leader Dollar Shave Club (now owned by Unilever) and its hugely popular viral videos starring founder Michael Dubin. Harry's, headquartered in SoHo, has amassed some 3 million customers, growing twice as fast as the e-commerce shaving category overall, with estimated revenue of $200 million in 2016. It was dubbed "the Warby Parker of shaving" by Inc magazine, an obvious nod to Raider's role in that disruptive, hugely successful eyewear seller. The Harry's campaign will air on national prime-time TV, mostly during male-targeted programming. It will also run in theaters and across social media with the tagline, "Meet the shaving company that's fixing shaving." Procter & Gamble's Gillette, though no longer suing Harry's, isn't taking the competition sitting down. It recently debuted a digital campaign of its own that hits its bargain-priced rival head-on, using social media comments from consumers who tried Harry's but abandoned the service. Gillette "Welcome Back" campaign, using the theme song from '70s sitcom Welcome Back, Kotter, is doling out free razors as part of an accompanying promotion. Though it's not the focus of the ads, Gillette now has its own shaving subscription service, launched in mid-2015 as a response to its e-commerce rivals. Men's grooming is huge business, with the overall category estimated at $3.3 billion in the U.S. alone, with online shaving clubs becoming the fastest-growing segment, according to Slice Intelligence. With so many brands duking it out in the space, Harry's execs said they believe in their "self-deprecating, hopefully relatable approach" to their first TV ads. "There's all this noise in the industry, and brands are shouting really loudly," Raider says. "If people get a peek into Harry's, they'll see our attention to detail. And we'll use this as a platform for more compelling creative down the line."

Procter & Gamble's Gillette, though no longer suing Harry's, isn't taking the competition sitting down. It recently debuted a digital campaign of its own that hits its bargain-priced rival head-on, using social media comments from consumers who tried Harry's but abandoned the service. Gillette "Welcome Back" campaign, using the theme song from '70s sitcom Welcome Back, Kotter, is doling out free razors as part of an accompanying promotion. Though it's not the focus of the ads, Gillette now has its own shaving subscription service, launched in mid-2015 as a response to its e-commerce rivals. Men's grooming is huge business, with the overall category estimated at $3.3 billion in the U.S. alone, with online shaving clubs becoming the fastest-growing segment, according to Slice Intelligence. With so many brands duking it out in the space, Harry's execs said they believe in their "self-deprecating, hopefully relatable approach" to their first TV ads. "There's all this noise in the industry, and brands are shouting really loudly," Raider says. "If people get a peek into Harry's, they'll see our attention to detail. And we'll use this as a platform for more compelling creative down the line."

Application in Water Treatment to Remain Primary Driver  Applications in several end-use industries will continue to fuel the market for fatty amines globally. By 2016 end, the global fatty amines market is estimated at US$ 1,855.3 Mn. Developing countries in Asia-Pacific will remain the key markets for fatty amines, whereas applications in water treatment and agro-chemical industries will continue to generate significant demand for fatty amines.      (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161114/438683LOGO ) Browse Full Market Overview and Research Methodology@ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/fatty-amines-market.asp Corrosion inhibition, fabric softening, lubricant additive, organ claying, and sanitization are some of the most popular applications, which are expected to sustain the demand for fatty acids in a market. A few other prominent applications, including mining, water treatment, personal care, anti-caking, oilfield chemicals, paints and coatings, and agro-chemicals, are also likely to register significant consumption. Rising global population resulting in increasing demand for food products is eventually driving the market for asphalt-additives and agro-chemicals. Similarly, growing need for water treatment will be a major factor propelling the market for water treatment chemicals, and in turn escalating the sales of fatty amines. The advent of technology and new application development will be a vital factor favoring the market growth. Mining, paints and coatings, fabric conditioning, and detergents, are foreseen to be the major verticals recording notable consumption of fatty acids. Industries associated with the paints and coatings vertical, such as automotive and construction, are foreseen to be among the prominent consumers of fatty amines. The volatility of the prices of raw materials and uncertainty of the fatty amines availability may, however, continue to create unfavorable conditions for the global fatty amines market growth. A sample of this report is available upon request@ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/12913 By product type, the global fatty amines market will witness continued dominance by the tertiary fatty amines segment. With the largest market value share of over 47% by 2016 end, this segment may experience a slight decline in its market share post-2016. Primary fatty amines segment, with over 29% revenue share in 2016, is likely to witness a Y-o-Y of 4.9% in 2017 over 2016. Based on application, water treatment segment is anticipated to lead the global fatty amines market. Agro-chemicals will also be another key segment, followed by asphalt-additives. Oilfield chemicals segment will also remain a notable application segment. Other application segments include anti-caking and others i.e. mining, personal care, and fabric softener. "View Report Table of Contents, Figures, and Tables" By region, APAC is likely to remain dominant with nearly 30% market value share in 2016. In 2017, this region will witness moderate Y-o-Y growth of 4.2% over 2016.  The next key market is North America that is expected to exhibit a higher Y-o-Y of 6.3% in 2017 over 2016. DuPont, Kao Corporation, AkzoNobel N.V., Clariant AG, Evonik Industries AG, Procter & Gamble Chemicals Company, Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, CECA Arkema Group, Lonza, and Volant-Chem Group are some of the leading companies participating in the global fatty amines market.

Published on January 03, 2017. Most Popular YouTube video bloggers and other independent producers have been a growing part of marketing content creation for brands, sometimes in deals brokered by third parties. Now Google itself is getting in on the action, linking YouTube video production talent with brands and their agencies to produce video ads for the site. Through an initiative called YouTube Labs, Google, working with influencer network AwesomenessTV, recently linked L'Oreal brands Maybelline, Essie and Dark & Lovely with YouTube creators, who also worked with agencies Code & Theory and Tag Creative. The result is a series of videos for each brand. L'Oreal USA had exclusive U.S. use of YouTube Labs for 2016 in what Kirk Perry, Google president-client and agency relations, describes as an alpha test, though the model will be open to other companies this year. In Europe, BMW, Johnson & Johnson and Mondelez have tested the approach. The effort moves Google into a sort of talent brokerage, linking content creators on YouTube with brands. And in the case of the L'Oreal brands, that didn't mean hooking them up with beauty bloggers with which they're already familiar in many cases through content or promotional deals. Rather it meant bringing creative talent from others areas, such as travel blogger Raya Encheva, together with brands. Google doesn't make any commission or fee from the arrangement, Mr. Perry said, though the content creators do, and Google benefits from paid advertising revenue for placement of the videos on its site. There's no restriction on brands using the videos elsewhere, such as Facebook, other publishers or their own sites. The effort came out of brainstorming sessions earlier last year on "the next generation of content," said L'Oreal USA Chief Marketing Officer Marie Gulin-Merle. "The idea was to put in one room in a beauty hackathon the YouTube creators, our marketing teams and our agencies. We would behave as publishers and invent the web series." Howard Collinge, group creative director at Code and Theory, which worked on the videos for Essie and Maybelline with the YouTube creators, said he doesn't see the outside help as a threat. "This was a really great collaboration," he said. "From the creative side, I think it gave us a lot of freedom." The emphasis was on speed, with the agency going straight to production once the scripts were approved, guided by insights from YouTube creators and what they knew about the market," he said. "But we essentially wrote scripts and went and shot them. So we used them as a springboard. We had a lot of creative freedom to do what we thought was the right thing." The brief was simple, Mr. Collinge said: "Be entertaining and really get their attention and be relevant. That's a great brief for any agency. It was a very experimental lab approach that felt a lot freer and more fun, nothing like a typical ad agency where you get briefed and have six weeks to work and then research and go shoot a commercial." Ms. Gulin-Merle also describes the process as "less linear than before," replacing the usual process involving copy testing. "It was a fast and furious way of working with one motto: Better done than perfect. It's OK if you don't take another week to polish the content. You put it online and optimize from there and listen to the conversations and feedback from the consumer." Among the ideas in the series was to tap into the stories behind the names of Essie nail polishes, she said. One video tells a story behind "Jamaica Me Crazy," named after an annoying vacation-intensive coworker and her trip to the island. It's less clear if Google getting involved as a conduit between YouTube creators and brands helps companies like Gen.Video, which has done the same thing albeit with somewhat different projects for such players as Procter & Gamble's Olay. "This is a logical and inevitable evolution of Google's facilitation role in the YouTube marketplace," said Jessica Thorpe, president of Gen.Video, in a statement. "It will put added pressure on companies (platforms and agencies) to provide more services than simply matching to support and amplify the impact of influencer video." Gen. Video is already doing that, she said, in part by facilitating distribution of videos created by the producers it represents on e-commerce sites. "The players that only provide exchange-based matching will quickly die out, and those that can differentiate will thrive as leveraging influencers becomes more universal," she said. But she said Google's involvement will "be another catalyst for growth for the video generation." "I don't think we compete in any way, shape or form with the Gen.Videos of the world or the Tongals of the world," said Google's Mr. Perry. "We obviously have a little insight on the YouTube business and the creator ecosystem. We also have access to a lot of data and analytics about where consumers are and what they're watching. So we have that unique insight others wouldn't have." While Google gets no money directly from making the introductions, the idea, he said, is an investment to make brands more comfortable so they'll want to reach consumers on Google media. ~ ~ ~ CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article did not note that Google had worked with influencer network AwesomenessTV to link L'Oreal brands with YouTube creators.

However, high pricing coupled with less availability of professional hair care products across the designed distribution channels are restricting the market growth. Although, the professional hair care products market has attained a maturity level in developed countries, introduction of highly specialized products in shampoo and hair colorant category is anticipated to enhance the market growth. Also, in developing countries introduction of products addressing issues of consumers related to grey hair, dandruff and hair loss are expected to fuel the market growth.

New Year's Levee 2017 Stephen Petrick Bay of Quinte MP Neil Ellis dances with Belleville city councillor Jackie Denyes at the New Year’s levee. next play/pause pre Belleville News By Stephen Petrick Belleville – The year 2016 was a busy one for Belleville, but 2017 could be even more interesting. Because many city projects came into fruition over the past 12 months – such as the deal to land the Belleville Senators and the deal to land Shorelines Casino Belleville – there will likely be quite few ribbon-cutting events over the next 12 months to mark the official completion of those projects. “Fasten your seat belts, 2017 is going to be a very busy year,” said Mayor Taso Christopher at the city’s New Year levee on Sunday, Jan. 1. Hundreds of city supporters packed the gym at the Quinte Sports & Wellness Centre, to hear Christopher’s speech. The levee has become a Belleville tradition, as it allows the mayor and city councillors to bring New Year’s greeting to city residents. It also allows the mayor to deliver a speech highlighting city accomplishments from the previous year and what to expect in the new year. Christopher started by pointing out that 2016 was a record year for Belleville in terms of construction, as the city granted permits to projects worth a total value of more than $100 million, between the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. Meanwhile, a long list of capital projects were completed or got underway, including renovations to Sidney Street, Coleman Street and the Corby Rose Garden. The Bay Bridge/Dundas Street West project is 95 per cent complete, Christopher said and other important infrastructure projects moved forward, including the installation of new lighting at Jane Forrester Park; work the mayor called “breathtaking.” He also reminded residents of many newsworthy events that took place 2016; the city’s hosting of the World Under-19 Women’s Floorball Championships, the visit from delegates in Belleville’s South Korean sister city of Gunpo and, of course, the agreement to bring the Senators to the city. Renovations to the Yardmen Arena, to make room for the Senators for the start of the 2017-18 American Hockey League season are underway. “This is an exceptionally exciting time as we welcome professional hockey to Belleville,” said Christopher, setting off a heartfelt applause from the audience. He thanked the team of city officials, led by recreation director Mark Fluhrer, for the work they put in to make the deal happen. He also thanked Ottawa Senators owner Eugene Melnyk for investing in Belleville. “It was a pleasure working with him and I have a big note here. It says ‘Go Sens Go.’” He noted that the Senators, along with the new casino, currently under construction on Bell Boulevard, are primed to make Belleville a great tourist destination. He also hinted that the casino will open earlier than expected. “My spidey senses tell me it’s nine days away, ten days away.” he said. Those developments, however, are just a few examples of private business growth in Belleville. Christopher also spoke about the recent expansion of east-end business Triangle Fluid and how Procter & Gamble is planning a 160,000-square foot expansion of its College Street East facility. These developments, and others, are contributing to a healthy economy, Christopher said. He said the latest federal government statistics on the unemployment rate for Belleville’s region show a rate of 4.9 per cent. “That is a record,” he said. The warm speech was preceded by nearly an hour of cheery small talk outside the gymnasium. Citizens walked in and greeted Christopher and council members who formed a wedding-like reception line. At 12:20 p.m., the Air Force Pipe and City Pipe and Drum band, led the group into the gymnasium, to the sound of bagpipes. Towards the end of the speech, a video was played to commemorate Belleville’s 200th anniversary, which will be celebrated throughout 2017. The video is called My Belleville 200 and it quotes several residents talking about what they love about the city. The video served as a reminder that 2017 will be a festive year for the city, as Canada will also be celebrating its 150th birthday. “2017 is going to be another big year for the City of Belleville,” Christopher said.

Skip to content » « Covestor.com Learn More » Search The latest investment news from Covestor by Covestor Menu ProcessHow we’re investing now Profilesof smart investors OutlookMarket opportunities Strategiesand how they’re applied 2017: Where to invest January 2, 2017 by Charles Sizemore The year 2016 was, for lack of better description, a strange one. It started with one of the worst Januarys in history for stocks and an oil price bust. Then came a run of populist election surprises in Europe and the United States, and wrapped up with the Trump Rally. So after a year like that, what will 2017 bring? Here are some investing ideas that may help shape your thinking.     REITS I really believe real estate investment trusts (REITs) are the single most attractive American asset class right now. REITs have gotten utterly obliterated by the recent surge in bond yields. As a sector, they are down about 14% from their summer highs, and many of the more “bond-like” conservative REITs are down by closer to 30% as of December 19. That’s ugly. REITs are sensitive to bond yields for two reasons. First, they borrow a lot of money to buy their properties, so higher market interest rates cut directly into profits. Secondly, as income-focused investments, they are priced relative to bonds. So as bond yields rise (and bond prices fall), REIT yields rise (and prices fall). Inflation Hedge Remember: REITs, unlike bonds, actually enjoy a rising payout over time. REITs tend to raise their dividend by at least a couple percent per year, more than keeping pace with inflation. And should the inflation that everyone seems to fear from a Trump presidency come to fruition, real estate should perform at least moderately well, in my opinion, as real estate is a natural inflation hedge. That makes the Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ) — which holds REITs such as Simon Property Group Inc (SPG) and Public Storage (PSA) — a natural play here in my opinion.   ENERGY The past two years have been rough for investors in energy stocks. If low oil and gas prices weren’t bad enough, there has also been constant political opposition to domestic infrastructure projects, such as the Keystone Pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline, both of which became cause célèbres for environmental activists. Well, it remains to be seen what direction oil and gas prices go from here. The OPEC meeting late last year seemed to show that the major crude exporters are serious about keeping prices stable.   Pipeline Politics But virtually every member of the cartel is also known to cheat on their quotas, so we’ll see how this agreement sticks. But regardless of what direction oil and gas prices go, I think it is all but certain that energy infrastructure does well. President-Elect Trump has already said that he intends to give the green light to the two contentious pipelines, and I expect that this is only the beginning. Meanwhile, in my opinion, midstream pipeline stocks are cheap after the thrashing they took in 2015. So, in my opinion, adding MLPs such as Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI) to your portfolio makes sense.Or you could add Energy Transfer Equity LP (ETE).   BONDS Hear me out. I’m actually not going to recommend that you back up the truck and load up on bonds. Even after the massive surge in yields in 2016, in my opinion, bonds still don’t yield enough to be worth a major speculative allocation right now. But let’s say that you’re in or near retirement and that you’re investing along the lines of a traditional 60/40 portfolio. The bonds aren’t going to be a major source of return at current yields, but they could definitely still be valuable as volatility reducers. And this would seem like a sensible time to rebalance. Stocks have been flying ever since the election, but bonds are down sharply. Overheated Stocks I expect stocks to cool down, at least for a few months, and I expect bonds to recoup a fair bit of their losses. We may not see bond yields back at July levels again, but I do expect them to be lower than they are today. In my view, the market is spooked that republican control of Congress and the presidency will lead to large deficits and resurgent inflation. But if large deficits were all that it took to stoke inflation, then Japan would have the highest inflation in the world right now. It doesn’t. So, if you’re due for a portfolio rebalance, I believe this would be a sensible time to do it, when stocks risen a little too far too fast, and bonds have fallen a little too far too fast. One suggestion is the iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF (IEF), which holds intermediate-term bonds.   CONSUMER STAPLES While the broad market is expensive right now, not all sectors are equally overpriced. Some, like automakers, are actually pretty cheap. But consumer staples stocks are just about prohibitively expensive. Investors have been wary of this bull market for year and have responded by staying invested, but doing so by overweighting the sectors that are traditionally considered the most conservative, such as consumer staples. The result has been an overpricing of these “safe” sectors to the point that they are no longer safe.   Rich Valuations Even the most stable and predictable business can be a lousy buy at a price that is too high. Procter & Gamble Co (PG) and Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL) sport price-to-earnings ratios north of 20. Not worth it, in my view. My advice is to stick with cheap consumer cyclicals via the Consumer Discretionary SPDR ETF (XLY). As I mentioned, automakers are particularly cheap, and the market seems to be pricing in steep declines in sales. So if anything other than the worst-case scenario happens, I believe cheap consumer discretionary stocks should do just fine.   Photo Credit: Nigel Howe via Flickr Creative Commons The following is an excerpt from an article originally published on InvestorPlace. Charles Sizemore Charles Sizemore Dividend Growth The Dividend Growth portfolio selects dividend-paying stocks that I believe will provide an attractive income over the next decade and beyond. I believe a fundamental shift in investor preferences is occurring that favors income over growth. This is due, in part, to the aging of America’s Baby Boomers. At the same time, I see traditional income investments such as bonds and certificates of deposit currently offering unattractive yields that are quite low. Manager Benchmark S&P 500 Strategic Growth Allocation The Strategic Growth Allocation portfolio is Sizemore Capital’s answer to traditional asset allocation. It invests primarily using ETFs. The portfolio is appropriate for risk-averse investors that prefer a more passive "buy and hold" strategy that is consistent with their risk and return goals.   My goal is to achieve returns comparable to the S&P 500 Index while potentially taking on less risk.

The major players offering a wide variety of shampoos in the market include Procter & Gamble Co., L’Oréal S.A., and Unilever plc. Hair styling products form a highly attractive segment in the hair care market and is projected to expand at a 4.4% CAGR. Hair styling products include mousse, holding sprays, heat-resistant sprays, sprays for curly hair, serums, and gels. The growing demand for hair styling products due to the changing purchasing behavior and patterns of consumers is likely to boost this product segment. A key trend noted in this segment is the fact that local manufacturers in Africa and APAC have been focusing on new product development and innovation catering to consumer preferences so as to establish a loyal customer base over the years. Hair colors are gradually witnessing increased demand across the globe. This can be attributed to the ever-rising influence of the fashion industry and a rise in the global aging population. A recent trend noted in this segment is an increase in male consumers. Men’s grooming products have gained much popularity in recent years and this global trend is reflected in the hair color market as well.

(WMT) and the Terrible Trump Tariff Trump promises a 5% import tariff, and Amazon continues to steal foot traffic. WMT stock is in trouble. By Joseph Hargett, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Dec 29, 2016, 9:40 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: Monday’s Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) and AT&T Inc. (T) 2 Trades for the General Electric Company (GE) Stock Comeback Under Armour Inc (UA) Stock Is Headed to $30 Recent Posts: 2 Trades for the General Electric Company (GE) Stock Comeback Friday’s Vital Data: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCAU) 2 Trades to Play the Exxon Mobil (XOM) Stock Breakout (or Breakdown) View All Posts The new year could be a rough one for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and other brick-and-mortar retailers. Not only are they seeing their worst foot traffic since 1972 as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) flexes its online muscles, but President-elect Donald Trump has said that he is considering an executive action to impose a 5% tariff on imports — news that sent WMT stock plunging last week. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr And we haven’t even touched on Trump’s increasingly rocky relationship with China, which threatens to kick off a trade war with one of the largest suppliers of cheaply manufactured U.S. imports — and one of the largest holders of U.S. debt. The wealth of pressure facing Walmart stock has already sent analysts running for the sidelines. According to data from Thomson/First Call, 21 of the 30 analysts following WMT stock rate the shares a hold or worse. Meanwhile, the 12-month price target rests at $74.59, representing a premium of about 7.91% to yesterday’s close. Should Trump impose his tariff, or Amazon continue to take market share, we could see more analysts revise their outlooks downward. That would pile additional pressure on Walmart stock. Elsewhere, Walmart short sellers smell blood in the water. During the most recent reporting period, WMT edged out Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) as the 12th most shorted stock on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Some 28 million shares of WMT stock are now sold short, representing about 2% of Walmart’s total float. Look for shorting activity to pick up sharply if Trump gets his way. As a clear sign that short sellers are not worried in the least about a potential WMT rally, options activity has grown increasingly put-heavy. Currently, the January/February put/call open interest ratio stands at 1.26, with puts easily outnumbering calls among short-term options. Typically, short sellers will buy up calls as a hedge against potential rallies in the underlying stock, but this is far from the case with WMT. Click to Enlarge Looking out to the February series to judge the potential impact of an incoming Trump presidency, implieds are pricing in a potential move of about 3.6% for WMT stock. This is more inline with implieds surrounding an earnings report than the stock’s historically lower volatility readings. As a result, the upper bound lies at $71.24, while the lower bound lies at $66.26. Technically, the upper bound lies well short of recent resistance near $72, while the lower bound rests well below key short-term support levels and WMT stock’s October lows. What does this mean for those looking to trade?
