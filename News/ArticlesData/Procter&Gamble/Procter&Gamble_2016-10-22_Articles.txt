Each rubber-stamped image was allocated SR20 by the three Saudi firms, and the proceeds, totaling SR50,000 were then donated to Al Ehsan Human Care Charity Association. “We’ve been overwhelmed by the reaction of our consumers and how they’ve taken to this Guinness World Record attempt. We’d like to thank everyone who took part and who made it possible for us to say thank you to our public employees on today’s Saudi National Day,” said Hossam Chehab, National Sales Director. He added: “Saudi National Day is a special occasion for us all to remember our country’s development with pride and joy. For our consumers, it’s an important date in the calendar, and we wanted to design an activity that would engage our shoppers and which would give them an opportunity to get involved.” The new Guinness World Record was set by Saudi shoppers using rubber stamps to create a mosaic image of the Kingdom. The campaign, which was live for a period of three days in the run up the then 86th Saudi National Day celebration, was a tribute to the Kingdom’s public employees and their service in support of the country and its people. Talal Omar, MENA country manager at Guinness World Records, said: “Breaking a Guinness World Record is no mean feat; an attempt must fulfill key criteria before it will even be considered – it must be measurable, breakable, verifiable and standardizable, among others. These criteria were met, and Saudi consumers created the image with the highest number of individually-stamped contributions globally. We would like to extend our congratulations to them.” — SG TAGS Panda Retail Company SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleTo fight deadly stigma, Kenya turns to albino beauty pageant Next articleNatcom stuns Nestle Milo Sadiq Hussain RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Panda unveils digital action to promote healthy lifestyle Panda distributes free shopping vouchers to hospitalized children Panda holds employee Iftar NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply November 2016 S M T W T F S « Oct       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30   STAY CONNECTED 1,489,252FansLike 41,132FollowersFollow Ads Recent Posts SR16b dirty money: 15 under probe Nov 20, 2016 48-hour coalition truce in Yemen takes effect Nov 20, 2016 Traffic disrupted as pedestrian bridge collapses in Jeddah Nov 20, 2016 Some public buildings found violating law on hoisting national flag Nov 20, 2016 Ministry comes to the rescue of abused woman Nov 20, 2016 Archives November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 © Saudi Gazette 2015 All rights reserved.

The Director for Policy in Africa at the United States Chamber of Commerce, Dr. Leila Ndiaye, in this interview with Obinna Chima, spoke about the objectives of the initiative as well as its capacity to enhance bilateral trade between African countries and the U.S. Excerpts: What is the objective of the U.S-Africa Business Center ? The objective is to increase bilateral trade between the U.S. and Africa. The other objective is to make that American companies are being understood and take part in the emerging Africa. That is because everywhere you go today, they talk about emerging Nigeria and emerging Africa. So, we want to be part of this emerging trend. But most importantly, we want African companies and business leaders to sit down on the same table with American companies and tell them how to do business with Africa as well as how they can together, partner to do business. It is either we help them do business in America or together they do business as partners. We have realised a long time ago that Africa is an untapped market. We know that Africa is not just one country, it is made up of 54 countries, compared with a lot of people who think Africa is one country. We know that Nigeria is the biggest market, etc. But, how is it that we can help? It is a win-win situation because we want to make money, and you (African businesses) also want to make money. But it comes with very favourable investment climate, it comes with the know-how of the market. But only you can tell me how to do business in your country , just as I am the only one that can tell you how to do business in my country. So, that is a win-win. But why did the Chamber come up with this initiative when we had the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), or has AGOA failed? AGOA didn’t fail. But one can say that it didn’t reach its full potential. And both sides did not benefit from it. You have to understand that AGOA has more than 6,000 products that can enter the U.S. free of taxes, back and forth. But people are not aware of that. Only a handful of companies in Nigeria and everywhere in Africa, really benefitted. We have extended AGOA for another 10 years. So, we must focus on what is beyond AGOA. We established this center because we are proactive. We launched it last December. We advocated strongly for AGOA, we did the same for the American-EXIM Bank and as you can recall, last July, it was history. Some people had to fight so that the Congress would re-authorise what the U.S. Chamber can do. So, what we did was to make sure that we can do business in a very sane environment between both regions. Does the Chamber have specific criteria for organisations or even individuals  that intend to join the center? You know, we never had any African company as a member of the U.S Chamber. But we have opened the door for African companies. The first thing we are concerned about is the Foreign Practice  Act. So, you can be as wealthy as you want, but you have to pass some criteria. If you never worked in your life, and because your father was a Governor, and he stole money and gave you a company, you can be the wealthiest person on earth, but you can never be a member of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. We promote entrepreneurship, but entrepreneurship comes with a spirit. So, it is something that you need to have within your system, to build and create jobs. I don’t have anything about people’s inheritance, that is not what I am talking about. I am talking about money coming from the government, money laundering. You have to be a real entrepreneur. And any company with government funding cannot be part of the U.S. Chamber. What about a company that got its seed capital through government funding and after some years it developed capacity and has been sustaining itself, is such a firm not qualified to be a member of the Chamber? If you are a company, and you participated in a bid and for example, the government gives you licence to import rice, we won’t say know to such a company. But if you create your company and its revenues come from government, we cannot accept such a company. We have to make sure that everything is clean. Then, you have to understand the philosophy. The philosophy is the triple ‘A’ solution, which is – we advocate on your behalf, we advice you and we give you access. But the access tag we give you is unthinkable. At the government level, the private sector level, we host approximately 130 delegations in a year at the Chamber. There is no Head of State in this world that comes into Washington to meet the Department of States, President Obama or any U.S. government official, without stopping at the U.S. Chamber. This is because that is where the economy of America resides. That is where the dollars really reside. Does the center offer grants to members? We don’t offer grants. We give access to our members. We have more than three million companies whichmake us the largest business federation in the world. Consider the U.S. Chamber to be like the federal Chamber. Beneath us, you have 2,800 Chambers, both local and regional. Then, we have Chambers all over the world totaling 117. So, that is the network. We don’t give grant to anybody because we are not a bank. We are a policy shop. But we give access to where the resources can be, because we advice you and we open the door for you. Now, if your product is bankable, of course, we would look for who is interested within our members and it would be your responsibility to do your business pitch. However, I will make sure that you get to the right person or partner. I can give you an example of a success story of a company. We talked about AGOA, now we are talking about funding and how you do things. There is a company from Senegal that is in agro-business. It was the only company in the country that was really doing huge volumes in terms of refines,  jams, juices in America, coming from the West Coast. She is a member of the U.S. Chamber and actually the second African companies that joined the Chamber. Exactly five months ago, we invited the President of Afreximbank. He came, they sat down and discussed. She is already in five states and our plan was for her to go to Walmart. Walmart is my member. I want her to be in Whole Foods, which is also my member. Walmart has 700 stores in Africa, but not with the name Walmart and I want her to be in at least 20 of those stores. We sat down, we looked at the products. She was exporting to the U.S via AGOA, a member of the Chamber. Ninety per cent of her employees are women, 10 per cent are deaf people and so she is like socially responsible. And the Afreximbank promised to take the business to the next level. It took him just two hours to instruct his people to invest $15 million into this company for the lady to double her capacity of production. That is what we do. So, when a Head of State comes and if you are our member, you have the opportunity for one-on-meetings. There, you can address your priorities. Last year, we hosted President Muhammadu Buhari during his first official visit and we had more than 400 people in a room. That tells you how Nigeria is portrayed and how much the U.S. private sector is involved. So, we give you access, we advice you and we wish you goodluck. Not goodluck in a way that we want to get rid of you. That is because we would be there with you until we make sure you find a solution. But, I will never instruct a bank. So, what does it take to be a member? First of all, at the national level in the U.S, you just need to be registered in the U.S, no matter the size of your company. But if you are an international, then we have different programmes. There is the international division with all the different continents represented. I represent Africa as the Director. But there is a Know-Your-Customer (KYC) procedure that I do. KYC is very important. As someone with African origin, I want the best for my continent. I want to show America the best from my continent. So, I want the best entreprenuers who can roll their sleeves with Americans. For me, that is how I see emerging Africa. If you are the CEO of Dangote, Zenith Bank or any company from Africa, you should be able to sit down with the CEO of Procter and Gamble and agree on what they want to do together. Presently, how many Nigerian companies do you have as members? We cannot say, but we have considerable number. For Nigeria, what I like to do is to create a specific programme to be called the U.S-Nigeria CEO dialogue, which would be a specific Programme for Nigeria. It would take place in the first quarter of 2017 and by then I hope to have gotten more members from Nigeria, so that they can participate. It is also for us to have medium-sized and large sized American companies in the meeting. But at the first edition of the programme, I will just go with the top 10 Nigerian companies and top 20 or top 50 US companies. Top 10 in terms of what? In terms of the longevity of the company, turnover and as I said before, it has to be a company with a success story and a representative of the private sector. That is because any company that succeeds in Nigeria, should be able to spread or expand to Ivory Coast, Benin, Togo, Burkina Faso, etc, and we can help. The company I talked about in Senegal, today, her products are on the shelves in Ivory Coast, Gambia, Burkina Faso, and every where. But how did it start? It started with the meeting she had with us. But why did it take the U.S this long to integrate businesses in Africa? I think there have been a misrepresentation of the presence of  U.S. businesses in Africa. A company like Procter and Gamble or even General Electric. General Electric has been in Africa for over 100 years. The U.S private sector businesses have always been here. I always laugh because I tell people that there is no village where you don’t find gillete blade, which is made by Procter & Gamble. When you want to search for information on your phone, what do you use? Google. So, Africans consume America everyday. From Microsoft when you turn on your computer, from using using Google, you are creating jobs both sides (Africa and America), you use Facebook, you do the same. Procter & Gamble has more than 300 hundred products in Africa. These are American products. Where I agree with you is that we didn’t hear much about the U.S in areas such as infrastructure as much as lately, the Chinese. That is where I think the Chinese have made so much noise by building railroads, bridges, etc, across Africa. Maybe that is why some have the feeling that the U.S has not been present. But the U.S has always been present. But we want to do more infrastructure because there cannot be any development if there is lack of infrastructure. We have started with the programme, Power Africa. We need electricity in Africa and the U.S. has taken the step. So, we want to be more present in things that people see and feel. So, we want to be more involved in all sectors and we want to help Africa move from raw materials to develop the value chain processes in Africa. Why is it that Africa will always sell its coffee or cocoa as a raw material to the West? Why can’t they be processed into finished products, using our technology and sell in the African market? These are the things we want to be involved in. Currency is a major part of trade and we have FX controls in some countries in Africa. How does the Chamber assist its members in areas such as FX, Customs as well as the issue of multiple taxation faced by businesses in Africa? We do and I will give you some examples. Firstly, you know that you have the Common External Tarriff (CET) in ECOWAS. One morning I recieved an e-mail from one of our members about that. Secondly, there was a specific product that the tax was supposed to be 10 per cent, we sent our material to this country, and suddenly they said it was 35 per cent. That souldn’t have been because they have a common tarriff. So, I looked at it and said that wasn’t right because it is the same law that should be applied and implemented. So, that was how we engaged ECOWAS and we had an MoU with ECOWAS, which took care of the problem. So, that was why I said we are a policy shop. So, if the law is not favourable to any private sector person, we would make that that the law becomes a reality. The second question was about FX controls. This year, we signed an MoU also with the West Africa Bankers Association (WABA) and we were very concerned about the naira and the implication of the FX issue for foreign companies. We also invited the President of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede, to address our members in Washington on the FX issues in Nigeria. We chose Aig-Imoukhuede because of his experience as a former bank CEO and he understands the issues. Our members asked him questions and he was able to advice them better. Those who wanted to withdraw did not after the session. So, that is the kind of platform that we offer so as we come out solution and to enable each person to prosper. The U.S-Africa Business Center is going to turn a year by December and the Africa Department of the U.S. Chamber is just nine years old. But it doesn’t mean that the U.S. was not interested in Africa. The U.S. has always done business in Africa. But, it is the will of the private sector that made the U.S. Chamber to create the Africa Department. Does the Chamber also support startups? We do have a programme at the national level because you have to start somewhere. Of course, we support startups. Recently, we met with young entrepreneurs from 30 nations in Africa, startups only. We gave them the opportunity to present their projects. They went into a competition and we selected those that had the best business plan, etc. So, we do once in a while, engage with startups to make sure that we coach them. But our priority today is at the macro level. Our second priority is to make sure we have a strong programme for SMEs. Our third priority is to have a programme for women and make sure that we give them all the tools to prosper, especially in three sectors where we don’t see a lot of women – energy, agriculture and ICT.

Pritchard, who both heads up marketing at P&G and has just been appointed as Chairman of the Association of National Advertisers (ANA), drilled down into this topic during the trade body's 2016 Masters of Marketing Conference. And he suggested that turning the craft of advertising into a "force for growth" would require boosting creative standards, an area that can be neglected as marketers struggle to keep pace with the increasing number of channels at their disposal. "So, job one is to be the absolute best at our craft," Pritchard said. (For more, including further tips for brands, read Warc's exclusive report: Pritchard's three priorities for the future of advertising.) "Things like ad blocking may be a problem, but we actually have a much bigger opportunity to focus on, and that is growth. "Each and every one of us can make a difference by stepping up and elevating the skills and the craft to deliver better advertising that's of higher quality." Elaborating on this theme, he argued that advertising can be a "force for good" in much broader terms if it seeks to "help make the world better" in ways large and small. "What I'm really talking about here is everyday advertising that builds in points of view on things that matter to people, and where your brand matters," he said. "Our voice can be used to step up on important matters such as gender equality, racial bias, diversity and inclusion, and environmental sustainability." In order to give these issues the attention they deserve, though, marketers must first address problems of measurement, where current shortcomings limit the impact of their work and take time away from more valuable tasks. "We're spending way too much of our time, and wasted investment, on non-standard and faulty measurement – and a media supply chain that is murky at best, and, in some cases, even fraudulent," Pritchard said. "Surely, if we can invent driverless cars and virtual-reality experiences, we can find a way to track and verify media accurately. It's time that we come together, though, to solve these problems. And this is not any one piece of the industry; this is the entire industry."

A favorite of Sinatra and Lemmy, you can actually buy this 150-year old adult beverage by the barrel if you want. Rich Duprey (TMFCop) Oct 23, 2016 at 9:21AM Editor's note: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Brown-Forman's Jack Daniel's brand had not made the Interbrand list of top 2016 brands. The author and the Fool regret the error. Image source: Getty Images. Now that Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) has completed its acquisition of SABMiller, the $104 billion deal has created a beer-brewing behemoth that straddles just about every continent and has operations, sales, or employees in just about every country. The maker of Budweiser, Bud Light, and Corona beer is truly a global powerhouse that accounts for more than a quarter of the world's beer production, 45% of the industry's profits, and owns the first and/or second top-selling beers in more than a handful of markets, including the U.S., where it will continue to have a 45% share of the market. The merged company is also the fifth largest consumer products company in the world, behind such giants as Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo, but ahead of Coca-Cola and Mondelez International. Together, A-B InBev and Miller will have $55 billion in annual revenues and around $21 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, more than any other consumer products company. A beer by any other name According to brand consultancy company Interbrand, Budweiser by itself was already the biggest global alcohol brand valued at $15.1 billion, up 8% from last year's ranking and one position higher. Interbrand puts a lot into determining a brand's value. The ISO-certified methodology looks at how a business delivers on customer expectations to what it does to drive economic value, with the rankings based on a brand's cumulative value in three key areas: The financial performance of the branded products and services. The role the brand plays in influencing customer choice. The strength the brand has to command a premium price or secure earnings for the company. From that assessment, it organizes the list of top 100 companies. In the 2016 survey, the Budweiser brand came in 30th; last year it was 31st. That it was the biggest adult beverage brand probably surprises no one, but like me, you might have wondered which alcohol brands followed after. Can you guess who's on top? I examined Interbrand's list of the best global companies and sifted out only those that made adult beverages. On more than one occasion, I raised an eyebrow at which company was there and which wasn't, but the following list identifies the most valuable brands, their Interbrand rank, and their brand value: Budweiser (30) $15.099 billion Jack Daniel's (85) $5.193 billion Heineken (87) $5.123 billion Corona (93) $4.059 billion Johnny Walker (95) $4.317 billion Smirnoff (96) $4.252 billion Moet & Chandon (97) $4.118 billion One trend that stands out is the even split between beer and spirits, indicating there is no real difference between highbrow and lowbrow tastes. The absence of any of Miller's beer brands is also notable. That's particularly interesting because A-B InBev just acquired Miller on the strength of its global brand portfolio, particularly its leading position in countries such as Africa and Latin America (albeit for brands not under the Miller label). Also, aside from Anheuser-Busch having two brands on the list (Bud and Corona), the only other company to earn that distinction is distiller Diageo (NYSE:DEO), which owns the Johnny Walker brand of Scotch whisky and Smirnoff vodka. Everything tastes better with Jack The Jack Daniel's family of whiskey accounts for 55% of Brown-Forman's (NYSE: BF-A) (NYSE: BF-B) depletions, or shipments sent directly to retail or from distributors to wholesale and retail customers, a metric that is commonly regarded as a proxy for consumer demand. Its original black label Old No. 7 accounts for 55% of all the distiller's brand depletions and 30% of its total portfolio. Image source: David Pacey via Flickr. Moreover, Jack Daniel's has the distinction of being the fourth largest premium spirits brand and the biggest selling brand of American whiskey in the world. Yet having such a powerhouse brand also runs the risk of Brown-Forman being a one-trick pony that needs to always come up with variations on a theme. And that it has, and it's done so quite well, thank you. Tennessee Honey, a honey-flavored whiskey as its name suggests, is already the world's 15th largest premium brand, and its cinnamon-flavored Tennessee Fire is taking aim at Sazerac's leading Fireball brand. There's little question as to why people can walk into any bar a simply say they want a "Jack" and bartenders understand what they mean. Why Heineken is a top-shelf brewer As Heineken (NASDAQOTH: HEINY) calls itself, it is "is the world's most international brewer," led principally by its premium eponymous brand that is sold in more than 170 countries. It's also the second-biggest beer brand on the Interbrand global list. Image source: Felix Triller via Flickr. Heineken beer represents just 15% of the brewer's total volume, but it accounts for well over 30% of its profits. The company still sees another 10 to 20 years of growth ahead of it. When investors look to invest in alcoholic beverage companies, once having made the choice to put their money into beer, it's often a case of looking at the biggest, like Anheuser-Busch InBev, or in the niches, like craft beer. However, imports are certainly worth taking note of as the Brewers Association, which represents the craft beer industry, notes, import beer volumes grew 6% in 2015, accounting for a 22% share of the market -- almost double craft beer's share. Now, as sales of craft beer eases up, imports can shine through. As Heineken's Most Interesting Man in the World would say (yes, it also owns Dos Equis beer), "Stay thirsty, my friends." Rich Duprey has no position in any stocks mentioned.

A favorite of Sinatra and Lemmy, you can actually buy this 150-year old adult beverage by the barrel if you want. Rich Duprey (TMFCop) Oct 23, 2016 at 9:21AM Editor's note: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Brown-Forman's Jack Daniel's brand had not made the Interbrand list of top 2016 brands. The author and the Fool regret the error. Image source: Getty Images. Now that Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) has completed its acquisition of SABMiller, the $104 billion deal has created a beer-brewing behemoth that straddles just about every continent and has operations, sales, or employees in just about every country. The maker of Budweiser, Bud Light, and Corona beer is truly a global powerhouse that accounts for more than a quarter of the world's beer production, 45% of the industry's profits, and owns the first and/or second top-selling beers in more than a handful of markets, including the U.S., where it will continue to have a 45% share of the market. The merged company is also the fifth largest consumer products company in the world, behind such giants as Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo, but ahead of Coca-Cola and Mondelez International. Together, A-B InBev and Miller will have $55 billion in annual revenues and around $21 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, more than any other consumer products company. A beer by any other name According to brand consultancy company Interbrand, Budweiser by itself was already the biggest global alcohol brand valued at $15.1 billion, up 8% from last year's ranking and one position higher. Interbrand puts a lot into determining a brand's value. The ISO-certified methodology looks at how a business delivers on customer expectations to what it does to drive economic value, with the rankings based on a brand's cumulative value in three key areas: The financial performance of the branded products and services. The role the brand plays in influencing customer choice. The strength the brand has to command a premium price or secure earnings for the company. From that assessment, it organizes the list of top 100 companies. In the 2016 survey, the Budweiser brand came in 30th; last year it was 31st. That it was the biggest adult beverage brand probably surprises no one, but like me, you might have wondered which alcohol brands followed after. Can you guess who's on top? I examined Interbrand's list of the best global companies and sifted out only those that made adult beverages. On more than one occasion, I raised an eyebrow at which company was there and which wasn't, but the following list identifies the most valuable brands, their Interbrand rank, and their brand value: Budweiser (30) $15.099 billion Jack Daniel's (85) $5.193 billion Heineken (87) $5.123 billion Corona (93) $4.059 billion Johnny Walker (95) $4.317 billion Smirnoff (96) $4.252 billion Moet & Chandon (97) $4.118 billion One trend that stands out is the even split between beer and spirits, indicating there is no real difference between highbrow and lowbrow tastes. The absence of any of Miller's beer brands is also notable. That's particularly interesting because A-B InBev just acquired Miller on the strength of its global brand portfolio, particularly its leading position in countries such as Africa and Latin America (albeit for brands not under the Miller label). Also, aside from Anheuser-Busch having two brands on the list (Bud and Corona), the only other company to earn that distinction is distiller Diageo (NYSE:DEO), which owns the Johnny Walker brand of Scotch whisky and Smirnoff vodka. Everything tastes better with Jack The Jack Daniel's family of whiskey accounts for 55% of Brown-Forman's (NYSE: BF-A) (NYSE: BF-B) depletions, or shipments sent directly to retail or from distributors to wholesale and retail customers, a metric that is commonly regarded as a proxy for consumer demand. Its original black label Old No. 7 accounts for 55% of all the distiller's brand depletions and 30% of its total portfolio. Image source: David Pacey via Flickr. Moreover, Jack Daniel's has the distinction of being the fourth largest premium spirits brand and the biggest selling brand of American whiskey in the world. Yet having such a powerhouse brand also runs the risk of Brown-Forman being a one-trick pony that needs to always come up with variations on a theme. And that it has, and it's done so quite well, thank you. Tennessee Honey, a honey-flavored whiskey as its name suggests, is already the world's 15th largest premium brand, and its cinnamon-flavored Tennessee Fire is taking aim at Sazerac's leading Fireball brand.

However, another segment of the investing world is looking to avoid any election drama one way or the other. Instead of looking for stocks that could rise or fall depending on the outcome, these investors are looking for solid investments that will likely not be impacted regardless of which candidate wins. Related Link: What To Expect From Stocks Under A Clinton Presidency Here’s a look at five election-proof stocks to consider. 5 'Safe' Bets Come November 9 1. EOG Resources Inc (NYSE: EOG). In the second debate, both candidates discussed their energy plans, and both specifically mentioned natural gas as one of the centerpieces of the future U.S. energy industry. Barclays recently named EOG as its top natural gas stock pick. 2. Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG). Regardless of who wins the election and what it does to the country, people will still need deodorant, soap and toilet paper. Proctor & Gamble is one of the biggest blue chip consumer staples stocks in the market, and it also pays a generous 3.1 percent election-proof dividend. 3. Kroger Co (NYSE: KR). And where do people go to buy their deodorant, soap and toilet paper? The election outcome will likely have little impact on people’s grocery shopping, which is good news for Kroger investors. 4. Blue Buffalo Pet Products Inc (NASDAQ: BUFF) No matter how bad or good things get in Washington, most people’s furry friends still get the same serving of the same dog or cat food every single day. Blue Buffalo investors care about as much about the election outcome as your pets do. 5. Anheuser-Busch InBev SA NV (ADR) (NYSE: BUD). Depending on how things go down on November 8, the election outcome might make you want to have a few more drinks than usual. However, the fact is that people’s alcoholic beverage budgets tend to remain fairly constant no matter what else is going on in the world, making stocks like Anheuser Busch relatively unaffected by the outcome of the election.

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 23, 2016 12:29pm   Comments Share: Related D Mid-Morning Market Update: Markets Mostly Higher; General Electric, Baker Hughes To Create World-Leading Oilfield Tech Provider Earnings Scheduled For October 31, 2016 Related V Exclusive: CanPay CEO Presents New Debit Payment Solution For Marijuana Industry Jim Cramer Shares His Opinion On Teva, Visa, New York Mortgage Trust And Empire State Realty Trust Post-Election Layoffs In Aerospace, Autos, And More (Seeking Alpha) More than a third of the Dow Jones Industrials are on deck to report quarterly results this week. Wall Street expectations are perhaps highest for a chemicals giant and a leading credit services company. However, just one of these two is expected to show growth on the top line. The third-quarter earnings reporting season is in full swing, and more than a third of the Dow Jones Industrial Average components have shared their latest results so far. Most of the rest of the 30 Dow members are on tap to report this week, and the Wall Street expectations are perhaps highest for E I Du Pont De Nemours And Co (NYSE: D), better known as DuPont, and Visa Inc (NYSE: V). The Wall Street consensus forecasts call for earnings at both to have increased by double-digit percentages from the same period of last year. But analysts see top line growth from only one of them, for the period when DuPont moved forward on its merger with Dow Chemical and Visa provided the card of choice for Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST). When Delaware-based conglomerate DuPont shares its third-quarter results, the Wall Street forecast is that it will post a profit of $0.20 per share and $4.86 billion in revenue. That would compare with the earnings of $0.13 per share and revenue of $4.87 billion last year. It also would be the lowest revenue and second lowest profit results in the past eight quarters. The consensus of just eight Estimize respondents have pegged EPS at $0.23 and revenue at $5.35 billion for the three months that ended in September. In the previous two quarters, Estimize overestimated on the bottom line numbers, though the revenue number was just about on target for the second quarter. Related Link: This Week's Dow Earnings: Low Expectations For Exxon And Chevron Wall Street's consensus forecast for Visa is for earnings per share (EPS) to have risen by 11 cents from the same period of last year to $0.73. That estimate is unchanged in the past 60 days. The consensus of 137 Estimize respondents calls for $0.74 for the fiscal fourth quarter that ended in September. Note that Wall Street has underestimated EPS results in the past three quarters. Estimize predicts that the revenue of this San Francisco-based payments technology giant will total $4.20 billion for the quarter, up more than 16 percent from the year-ago period. Wall Street is a bit more optimistic, with its consensus forecast set at $4.23 billion. Back in the third quarter, Visa's revenue narrowly missed both forecasts. Visa is scheduled to report its results after the closing bell on Monday, while DuPont is expected to post its numbers first thing the following morning. Also this week, the consensus forecasts call for per-share earnings at Dow members Apple, Chevron, Coca-Cola and Exxon Mobil to be lower than a year ago. The EPS at Procter & Gamble are anticipated to be about the same as in the year-ago period. On the other hand, the consensus forecasts call for a gain in EPS at Boeing, Caterpillar, Merck, 3M and United Technologies, relative to a year ago. Only a handful of Dow components will be left to report after that, but watch for upcoming results from Cisco, Pfizer and Walt Disney. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

"Right now, they're scaring the daylights out of me," said Commissioner Wayne Guilfoyle. "It's going to be a tough budget year because we're hiring people with big salaries to sit and do nothing while other employees are out digging ditches. And next year it's going to be worse. The administrator's office is being redone, and Jackson has hired three or four people in addition to the deputy administrators, and one of them is a public information officer, Guilfoyle said. "How many public information officers does this government need?" he asked. "The fire department has one, but when something comes up Chief James comes to the podium. And they're talking about hiring a PIO for utilities." Guilfoyle said he wasn't consulted about the budget despite asking to be included in discussions. He also was not invited to a meeting where a decision was made to cut $700,000 from the Gold Cross ambulance contract. Neither was Mayor Hardie Davis, although he was supposed to be. "There was no discussion of cutting Gold Cross," he said. "They just went into a little meeting and took out a hatchet and started chopping. It's all under the administrator. I wasn't contacted about the budget even though I'm the finance committee chairman." ^ ...What It Is Ain't Exactly Clear: In a letter to commissioners accompanying a 200-page budget document Jackson states "the budget funds all essential services and programs despite revenue challenges." What revenue challenges could those be? "We was told the stormwater fee was going to be a cure-all," said Commissioner Marion Williams. "That was going to help us balance our budget, but I haven't seen it in the budget yet. I'm still looking. "Now we're talking about making cuts – 5 percent in fleet management. I don't see how we can make all those cuts." While some important things are being cut, the bureaucracy is growing. "We're building layers in our government," Guilfoyle said. "Even with this South Augusta Development Department, it was brought up that it should be under our government. People should pay attention to what's going on." But that's hard to do because Jackson and a favored group of commissioners make up a "very closed society" at the Marble Palace, Guilfoyle said. If you're not a part of it, you're out," he said. "The average citizens doesn't see it because they're not down there. The average person doesn't know what's going on." ^ Biting the Hands: Guilfoyle was also incensed that in Jackson's overview of the budget last week, she said traditional economic development and industrial recruitment have not enhanced property-tax collection significantly. Her examples included ADP, which was billed $69,330 in personal property and real estate taxes this year, but would have paid $346,585 without tax incentives. Starbucks was billed $211,245 in personal property and real estate taxes this year, but would have paid $1.37 million without incentives. "And for her to say on the commission floor that two large industries aren't paying enough taxes is unprofessional," Guilfoyle said. "Very unprofessional because the exemptions got approved by the commission. They provide jobs for people who live and shop in Richmond County and pay property taxes and sales taxes. ADP is doing an expansion right now. Millions and millions of dollars." ^ Section 4 – Expenditures by Department: The mayor wanted a $487,110 budget for his office next year, but the administrator recommended only $411,240, which is still a $102,290 increase. She also approved $38,750 for his "My Brothers Keeper" program, which is supposed to help young black males. President Barack Obama gets millions in donations from private corporations and businesses for his "My Brother's Keeper" initiative. I suppose the mayor could do that too, but Jackson took such a swipe at Starbucks, ADP, Keebler and Procter & Gamble about the city missing out on millions because of tax exemptions during her budget presentation, they might not be feeling so generous. Another city department that has ballooned like bureaucrats dining on government credit cards is the administrator's office. In 2014, when Jackson came on board, the office cost taxpayers $729,439, and next year the budget will be $1.04 million, which includes a $19,290 increase over this year's budget. And there was no such thing as a Compliance Department until last year when it absorbed the DBE and EEO offices whose combined budgets were $272,700.The Compliance Department's budget for next year, which includes the addition of an ADA office, is almost $600,000. And the Tax Commissioner's budget has grown from $2.83 million in 2014 to $3.42 million next year, a half-million dollar increase, or 23 times the amount Commissioner Steven Kendrick lost when he forgot to lock the safe. The Central Services Administration didn't exist in 2014 or 2015, and now it's costing $224,870. The Employee Incentive Awards program has gained a whopping $2,451 to $18,800 since 2014, which indicates incentivizing employees might not be a top incentive. ^ Section 5 – Program Enhancements, Now Personnel & Upgrades: The proposed budget will be discussed in coming weeks and final decisions on requests will be decided then. Among the many requests is the mayor's for $20,295 for employee upgrades. One would be upgraded to Executive Assistant to Communications/Policy Analyst. Another upgraded to Executive Assistant to Director of Community Outreach. They must stay up nights thinking up these titles. And what's wrong with the word "secretary"? The mayor's "My Brother's Keeper Program" would take care of one brother pretty good with a $16,793 paycheck for being a part-time executive assistant working 20 hours a week. The law department wants $176,316 for salaries for a new attorney and a paralegal who would be paid from the rain tax and the road tax, which Jackson stated the government is in a position to "accelerate." Remember that Compliance Office I mentioned earlier that didn't exist in 2014? It wants $52,621.65 for an Outreach Specialist. Human Resources wants to upgrade a Benefits Coordinator to a Benefits Supervisor for $20,732.93 and upgrade a Compensation & Benefits Manager to Assistant HR Director for $3,685.77. Maybe with these raises, they'd be able to figure out how to pay Linda Goodman, the widow of 30-year Richmond County law enforcement officer Bill Goodman, the pension they say they can't prove is due her because HR lost the paperwork. Central Services 311 wants two more people to take complaints. So maybe they'll be able to take your call the next time the garbage man skips your house. While the mayor got his Brother's Keeper Program, it appears he didn't get his $7,200 auto allowance. The tax commissioner didn't get his $3,600 auto allowance either. Traffic Engineering didn't get its $1 million for tree removal, which is pretty smart since recreation had asked for $110,000 to do a tree inventory, which they didn't get either. Only in Augusta would department heads ask to inventory trees and ask to cut them down in the same budget. At least it's not on the same page. ^ Section 8 - Commission Work Sessions, Presentations: Now doesn't that seem appropriate? Six of One. Half a Dozen of Another. Elections officials say early voting numbers being up presage high turnout in November, but not everyone thinks so. Dave Barbee, former Richmond County Republican Party chairman, said it just means fewer people will be voting on Election Day. "It will be like buying alcohol on Sunday," he said. "People used to buy it on Saturday. Now when they run out of beer Saturday night, they say, 'I'll get some more tomorrow.' They're not buying more alcohol. They're just buying it at different times."

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Advertise How to Build an Online Community Online Reputation Management October 22, 2016 Online Reputation Management Meg CabreraOctober 22, 2016 SEJ STAFF 670SHARES 684READS 670SHARES 684READS SEJ STAFFMeg Cabrera 670SHARES 684READS In the digital marketing world, more and more brands are now geared towards building a community. A community is a group of people engaging, sharing, and working toward a common goal. They are bound by similar interests, or thoughts. Brands like Disney and Red Bull have embraced this marketing initiative. Erica McGillivray, former senior community manager at Moz, talked about nurturing and growing a community in this recent Marketing Nerds episode. Listen to how she discussed the benefits of building a strong community around your brand, how they rolled out this strategy at Moz: Your browser does not support the audio element. Moz has successfully built its community through live events. At SEJ, we’ve also seen the importance of meeting our community through SEJ Summit, our conference series specifically designed for search marketers held year-round across the United States. The members of a brand’s community may not necessarily be product consumers. They may be a group of individuals who share a common belief, or who are followers of your brand.  These followers may become your biggest brand advocates, who can defend you in bad times, and empower your brand even more during good times. Here are a few tips on how to build your own community. Target Emotions One of the biggest advantages of building a community is allowing people to follow your brand, and they do this voluntarily. They weren’t forced, they deliberately decided to follow you. And once they do, they either love your brand or they’re upset. If they love your brand, then they’re your biggest brand ambassadors who will champion your causes. If they’re upset about your brand, welcome their insights, and hear them vent or rant about your brand. For sure, they’ll make it known in your community and will elicit good engagement between those who love you—and those who hate you. Good engagement will help your community grow. Educate Your Followers One good strategy to further build your community is to not talk about your brand. Instead, educate your followers about their need for your product, without even mentioning your brand. Procter & Gamble has a campaign called “Everyday” which offers insights and tips to the different members of their communities. The My Black is Beautiful community celebrates the collective beauty of black women. It provides fellowship amongst the members, plus it gives tips and provides education to its members. Hear Them Out Take advantage of the dialogue amongst the members of your community. Hear out their feedback, and make sure that you take action from their suggestions. Starbucks has successfully leveraged its community insights to come up with product ideas, experience ideas, merchandise materials, and community ideas in its My Starbucks Idea campaign. In Conclusion Build a dynamic community by welcoming your followers—both the good, and the not so good ones. Allow room for engagement and discussion, so you can learn from them. Educate them so they can also learn from you. Foster growth by helping them connect with others, so they can learn from each other as well.   Image Credits Featured Image: Rawpixel/DepositPhotos.com All screenshots by Meg Cabrera.

Busiest day for earnings, GDP and more coming in the next week CNBC 10/21/2016 Evelyn Cheng A flood of earnings, U.S. economic growth and some Fed speakers are set to hit markets in the coming week, and could help add confidence to a picture of moderate growth and an end to the earnings recession.  Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 110.06 +0.11 +0.10% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 760.16 +3.76 +0.50% Alphabet Inc GOOGL ▼ 775.97 -10.19 -1.30% About a third of S&P 500 (.SPX) companies are scheduled to report next week, including Apple (AAPL) on Tuesday. Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google's parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are set to post quarterly results on Thursday, the busiest day of the earnings season. "If nothing changes … we would say we came out of the earnings recession this quarter and that the second quarter was the final quarter of this earnings recession," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Financials, materials and technology are expected to show the most earnings per share growth this quarter, Stovall said, while energy industrials and telecom are forecast to be the laggards.  In the past week, financials were among the top performers after the major bank earnings topped expectations. The S&P 500 gained about 8 points for the week to end at 2,141 Friday. Next week, "I think really the big focus is going to be on earnings," said Casey Clark, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede. "I think we're in a situation where investors are focusing on earnings and traditional drivers of equity markets. Part of that is there's more comfort on global central bank policy." A UBS study in October showed that over the last five years, the S&P 500 moves more in sync with earnings per share than the level of interest rates. The correlation between stocks and earnings was very high, almost 90 percent, vs. less than 40 percent correlation between stocks and interest rates. The average year-end S&P 500 target is 2,198, according to CNBC's Market Strategist Survey conducted in October. But strategists are watching whether earnings growth will sustain further gains in the market.  "Next year's earnings look too high, and that might mean the market is a tad more expensive than it looks, but it's helpful that the third-quarter earnings [are beating so far]," said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at TIAA Global Asset Management, which has about $915 billion in assets under management. "We're still making our way out of this period where energy earnings look weak compared to where they were one year ago," Nick said. Most analysts expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates at its December meeting, but will watch data ahead of the central bank's meeting on Nov. 1 and 2. The Markit manufacturing and services PMI are scheduled for release next Monday and Wednesday, respectively. Three Fed speakers are set to speak Monday ahead of the blackout period heading into the Fed's meeting Nov. 1 and 2. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard speaks on the U.S. economy and monetary policy Monday morning, while Chicago Fed President Charles Evans is set to speak on current economic conditions and monetary policy in the afternoon. Fed Governor Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak later in the day on the future of Treasury market settlement. The first read on U.S. gross domestic product is due next Friday, and the consensus estimate from Reuters is 2.5 percent. The final read on second-quarter GDP showed an annual rate of 1.4 percent growth. A print between 1.5 percent and 3 percent is "probably a number consistent with the Fed passing in November but hiking in December," said John Canally, chief economic strategist at LPL Financial. Other data scheduled for release next week include the Markit manufacturing and services PMI, the employment cost index, consumer sentiment and pending home sales. Overseas, the preliminary estimate on third-quarter U.K. GDP is due for release Thursday, the first full-quarter GDP data since the surprise U.K. vote to leave the European Union. "Brexit negotiations [are] always on slow boil every week and next week is no different," Canally said. "A very weak number on the U.K.[GDP] may weaken Prime Minister May's hand temporarily." European Central Bank President Mario Draghi is scheduled to speak Tuesday in Berlin on "Stability, Equity and Monetary Policy."

Technical Alert: Exxon Mobil Higher How To Lower Your Risk With High Yielding Dividend Stocks (Seeking Alpha) More than a third of the Dow Jones Industrials are on deck to report quarterly results this week. Wall Street expectations are particularly low for two supermajor oil companies. Just one of these two companies beat earnings estimates in the previous quarter. The third-quarter earnings reporting season is in full swing, and more than a third of the Dow Jones Industrial Average components have shared their latest results so far. Most of the rest of the 30 Dow members are on tap to report this week, and the Wall Street expectations are lowest for Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) as the sector struggles with slowly recovering oil prices. The Wall Street consensus forecasts call for earnings at both supermajors to have dropped sharply year over year, in the period when OPEC agreed to a production freeze and Exxon caught the eye of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. When Chevron shares its third-quarter results, the Wall Street forecast is that its earnings per share (EPS) will have shrunk by more than 63 percent year over year to $0.45 per share, on $29.05 billion in revenue, which would be a more than 15 percent decline. Note that this integrated energy and chemicals company bested EPS estimates in the prior two quarters. But the estimate has dropped eight cents in the past 60 days. The forecast from 23 Estimize respondents sees EPS from the California-based company coming in at $0.44. Also, the consensus revenue estimate for the three months that ended in September is $30.71 billion. However, Estimize, like Wall Street, narrowly overestimated Chevron's revenue in the previous two quarters.

The 60 Estimize respondents are a bit less optimistic, with an estimate of $0.64 per share for the period that ended in September. Like Wall Street, Estimize narrowly overestimated Exxon's revenue back in the previous quarter, and this time the respondents are looking for $62.23 billion, which would be more than 8 percent lower than in the year-ago period. Wall Street is in the more pessimistic one here, with its consensus forecast of $61.34 billion. Wall Street does see top-line growth in the current quarter, but a decline for the full year. Both Chevron and Exxon are scheduled to report their latest results before the opening bell on Friday. Others This Week Also this week, the consensus forecasts call for per-share earnings at Dow members Apple and Coca-Cola to be lower than a year ago as well. The EPS at Procter & Gamble are anticipated to be about the same as in the year-ago period. On the other hand, the consensus forecasts call for EPS at Boeing, Caterpillar, DuPont, Merck, 3M, United Technologies and Visa to be larger than a year ago. Only a handful of Dow components will be left to report after that, but watch for upcoming results from Cisco, Pfizer and Walt Disney.
