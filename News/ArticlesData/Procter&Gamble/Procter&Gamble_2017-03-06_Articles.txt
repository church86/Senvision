Most Popular The Advertising Research Foundation has named Scott McDonald, a longtime researcher with Conde Nast and Time Inc., to fill its vacant CEO post as the industry's foremost research organization navigates growing conflicts over measurement and media deals. Scott McDonald, CEO, Advertising Research Foundation Credit: Advertising Research Foundation Mr. McDonald joins the ARF at what he acknowledges is a contentious time. The group's parents – the Association of National Advertisers and 4A's, which came together to establish the ARF in 1936 -- have been fighting for two years now over the issue of how transparent media agencies are in handling marketers' money. And the ARF's work is at the heart of another contentious industry issue – the demand by Procter & Gamble Co. that leading digital platforms such as Google and Facebook have their audience metrics verified by third-party research firms accredited by the Media Rating Council. "I think of the ARF as the Switzerland of the industry," or one of the few neutral places, Mr. McDonald said. Sources of information about media and marketing have become far more varied and complex in recent years, he said. "We've had a crisis of confidence because of that. It's the perfect time for research to be done to make our industry more fact based." To that end, he's considering taking some common pieces of digital video advertising inventory and having multiple third-party vendors analyze them, then analyzing their findings. "You look at how different they may be, and how that may be interpreted," he said, comparing the effort to a similar project the ARF launched last decade to validate work of vendors in neuromarketing. Mr. McDonald, who since 2014 has led media research consultancy Nomos Research, spent more than a decade heading research at Conde Nast, much of that time focused on digital audience metrics. "When it came down to it, it was an easy decision," despite several "great candidates," said Jed Meyer, chair of the ARF board and exec VP-corporate research at Univision Communications, who led the search effort. "It was a unanimous selection because of his experience and work." Gayle Fuguitt, a longtime General Mills researcher, left the ARF CEO post in October after four years, after leading completion of an extensive "How Advertising Works Today" look at how ad spending and practices deliver return on investment. In December, she became head of customer insights and innovation at Foursquare.

They help streamline the market research process. June Marshall & Behrad Mahdi, Repperio When you hear the phrase “market research” you think of Proctor and Gamble testing out different boxes on shelves at the supermarket.  Today’s interview has a focus on a different kind of market research, this helps federal acquisition professionals make sure they are getting competitive bids as well as assisting in federal contractors improving their teaming arrangements. Marshall has been active in the world of business development for decades.  She observes that there was no tool that allowed companies to gain a deeper understanding of the partnering process.  Rather than haphazardly find a company with experience in a specific area, there should be a clearinghouse of information for that company. The result was Repperio. Federal employee bill tracker: How pending legislation could affect your bottom line Mahdi brings his background in professional services to the game.  He views the Repperio platform as assisting federal acquisition specialists to do data driven market research as well as providing a dashboard to assist in comprehensive due diligence.

Highlights of the 2017 NAFE Top 60 Companies are: Female representation among CEOs at NAFE Top 60 Companies jumped 4 percentage points in the past year, with representation of women among CEOs outpacing the S&P 500.  Female representation among the top 10% of earners at the NAFE Top Companies increased 2 percentage points to 41%, the highest since 2013.  However, men still received the greatest number of promotions. The largest proportion of women promoted was to the manager level (46% of all promotions), but 61% of the promotions to senior manager and 65% of the promotions to corporate executive were awarded to men.  “NAFE emphasizes women with bottom-line and top-line responsibility — the positions that lead to the corner office — and we’re pleased to report an 8 percent increase in women running billion-dollar divisions at the NAFE Top Companies this year,” said Betty Spence, president of NAFE. “In addition, now nearly a third of these companies have five or more women on the board, with many simply increasing the number of board seats to add a woman.” The National Association for Female Executives is a division of Working Mother Media. The 2017 NAFE Top 60 Companies application includes more than 200 questions on topics including female representation at all levels, but especially the corporate officer and profit-and-loss leadership ranks. The application tracks and examines how many employees have access to programs and policies that promote advancement of women and how many employees take advantage of them, plus how companies train managers to help women advance. To be considered, companies must have minimum of two women on their board of directors as well as at least 1,000 U.S. employees.   The National Association for Female Executives (NAFE), founded in 1972, serves 20,000 members nationwide with networking, tools and solutions to strengthen and grow their careers and businesses.

But, especially given its highly consequential impact on United States interests around the world, the decision should be a no-brainer, even from the perspective of a climate skeptic.  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s confirmation hearing advice that we should stay in the regime and keep a seat at the table is clearly right. First, the U.S. team carefully negotiated the structure of the Paris Agreement so that it is up to each country to nationally determine its own climate program – no one can be forced to take action they’re not comfortable with.  Of course, the Agreement is built to encourage ambition – otherwise, there would be no point – but it does this in a non-intrusive way that allows countries to set their own path.  We advocated this approach because we knew it was crucial both to ensuring support at home and to securing the participation of countries around the world, including key emerging economies like China and India. Get daily updates from Brookings Enter Email Author Todd Stern Visiting Lecturer in Law - Yale Law School Former Special Envoy for Climate Change - U.S. Department of State, 2009-2016 Second, the range of support in our country for the Paris Agreement and for strong, sensible action to contain climate change is deep and wide, a far cry from the old days, 20 years ago, when the flawed Kyoto Protocol was at issue.  For example, the Senate’s leading foreign policy authority, Republican Chairman Bob Corker of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has counseled against withdrawal, recognizing the flexible nature of the Paris accord.  Large and influential swaths of American business, including companies like DuPont, United Technologies, ExxonMobil, General Mills, Hewlett Packard, Nike, Siemens, PG&E, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, and hundreds of others, have made clear their support for the Paris Agreement and climate action.  And institutions from Citibank to Goldman Sachs, Blackrock and Shell Oil, among others, have produced serious research on the actions that need to be taken and can be taken affordably to meet the Paris climate goals. Moreover, there is no logic in withdrawing from Paris even for the dwindling cadre of climate skeptics.  What skeptics assert, after all, is that the very widely accepted conclusion that climate change is real, is happening and is dangerous might be wrong. But even by this counter-factual view of science, facts and evidence, it is still obviously true that the widely-accepted conclusion about climate change and its dangers might well be right. And if it is, and we have elected to ignore it, not even bothering with an insurance policy, what then? We have never before ignored a risk of this magnitude to our well-being, our economy and our national security in any other context.  The Pentagon itself has powerfully articulated the imperative of addressing the climate threat: “The pressures caused by climate change…are threat multipliers that will aggravate stressors abroad such as poverty, environmental degradation, political instability, and social tensions – conditions that can enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence.” Related PlanetPolicy Can President Trump roll back the Obama emissions and fuel efficiency standards for light-duty vehicles?

Ebinger Wednesday, April 20, 2016 Finally, walking away from Paris would be an act of reckless disregard for United States standing in the world.  Should the White House take this step, countries around the world will feel betrayed, and will react with a mix of rage and deep disappointment.  The vast majority of them view climate change as a real, even existential threat. They are keenly aware that it took a monumental effort to reach the accord in Paris, where the rules of engagement require the consensus of more than 190 countries with a range of different needs and perspectives.  They know that 23 years after the original Framework Convention on Climate Change was agreed to in Rio, we finally established an ambitious, universal, flexible, nationally determined regime that makes it possible to meet the climate threat. And they will conclude that a U.S. rejection of Paris represents not just a national decision to pull back, but a deeply irresponsible effort to cripple the world’s capacity to contain climate change.  After all, an international regime to tackle climate cannot be effective without the world’s leading power, largest economy, second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and largest historic emitter. U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement would be taken by other countries as going far beyond the notion that the United States intends to recalibrate elements of its foreign policy, to urge NATO allies to contribute more to their own defense, to review the fairness of various trade arrangements, and so on. It would be taken as something between an incomprehensible punch in the face and the announcement of divorce proceedings. The strong national security team that President Trump has assembled, including not only Secretary Tillerson but also Secretary of Defense Mattis and General McMaster, the National Security Advisor, need to speak up and speak loudly in this internal debate. Their equities – all of our equities – are on the line.

The daffodils are fighting to make it to the surface, the crocuses are up and in some places the grass is starting to even give early indications that it might turn green. And everywhere you look the competition is getting heating up, too. Walmart is trying to win on price — and taking its suppliers along with them (whether said suppliers want to go along for the ride or not) — Amex is fighting to keep its affluent cardholders satisfied and bitcoin’s price is bubbling up — as buyers strive to catch hold of it before it goes mainstream (maybe) with the Winklevoss ETF. Ready to dive in? Walmart Gets Tough On Pricing Though Walmart’s slogan is no longer “Always Low Prices,” it seems they’ve taken a renewed interest in getting their prices well below the competition — as the world’s largest retailer by sales has kicked off a price-comparison test in about 1,200 of its U.S. retail locations. The test ranges across 11 states located in the Midwest and South and is squarely aimed at finding and setting new price points for a range of products it sells under its grocery banners, which post roughly 56 percent of Walmart’s sales. Reportedly Walmart is attempting to closing its pricing gap with rival grocery peddlers (like Kroger) and discounters (like Aldi). And we wonder if that technology comes by way of Jet.com, which was known for its super-duper pricing algorithms. The move is widely expected to put pressure on packaged good suppliers. A meeting in Arkansas with food and consumer products vendors reportedly came with Walmart more or less demanding that suppliers reduce their prices by 15 percent, according to unnamed sources. And these are big firms Walmart is putting the pricing pain on — Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Conagra Brands, Kraft/Heinz and Johnson & Johnson were all part of the meeting. As of yet, none of the involved brands have any official comment to offer. The expectation — according to reports — is that suppliers are going to help Walmart win a head-to-head pricing match-up 80 percent of the time. Walmart spokesman Lorenzo Lopez said the company is “not in a position to share our strategy for competitive reasons.” A pricing punch-out with Aldi and the other hordes of players in U.S. grocery sales could be costly for Walmart. According to Scott Mushkin, managing director of Wolfe Research and a leading pricing analyst, the retailer could be looking at spending as much as $6 billion to regain market share from all of its grocery rivals. Vendors, however, have confirmed that Walmart has told them it intends to maintain margins on average and lose money on some goods as part of its pricing plan and that it will absorb some of the losses so suppliers can adjust to the new pricing demand. One supplier noted that his company’s products had declined in price by as much as 30 percent in some stores over the past few months. “It helped them figure out the sweet spot that drives traffic,” the person said. Walmart also said it wants vendors to make logistics improvements that would help vendors get $1 billion more in sales and that it would work harder on shipping orders in full and on-time, which would trim delivery costs, reduce re-orders and decrease out-of-stock problems. “Walmart is trying to go back to where they were 10 years ago when they were absolutely the low price leader,” a large packaged food supplier told Reuters on condition of anonymity. “We understand they are willing to give up profits to a large extent in some cases, so they can invest in their own brand.” But Walmart isn’t alone in the move to cut prices. Target (in the wake of a punishing earnings report) has announced that it will be throwing as much of $1 billion of its own money into lowering prices for consumers — as it works to drive traffic back to their stores. Amex Plays Rewards Hardball The Chase Sapphire Reserve Card, with its fancy metal instead of plastic body and extremely generous points offering for new sign-ups, got a lot of buzz and attention earlier this year. In fact, the card was made so popular by YouTube unboxing videos that the manufacturer ran out of the metallic stock from which the card was made. And Amex clearly has had enough of Chase turning their affluent customer’s heads — and is now doubling down on how to keep them happier. Happier — and away from its emerging competitors at Chase and Citibank. So the Amex Platinum card is getting a makeover. It will be made of metal and will be a lot more rewarding. New perks include $200 a year in Uber rides, richer credits for spending, access to more airport lounges, special dining and entertainment options, and free use by family members of an American Express Gold card. But as membership has its advantages, it also has its costs. As of Mar. 30, the annual fee for cardholders will increase to $550 a year from $450 a year. American Express’ platinum customers tend to represent superior profit margins and a greater proclivity for more card-based spending — hence the push from Chase and Citibank to snap up that desirable customer set. Amex noted it had been working on changes to the Platinum card long before JP Morgan Chase rolled out the Sapphire Reserve card. “This is a response to listening to our customers,” an Amex official noted. “We are always looking at ways to bring value to our card members.” That it waited to roll out these long-planned upgrades until right after Chase drastically scaled back the sign-on bonus for the Sapphire Reserve card? Probably just a coincidence. Speaking of coincidences, good luck and things logic has a hard time explaining — the price of bitcoin is up again. The Bitcoin Bubble Bounces Back As of the writing of this story, the price of bitcoin was up to $1278.43 — putting its market cap is well over $20 billion and worth more than the world’s former favorite alternative asset — gold (currently worth $1,237 an ounce). The pricing hullabaloo (technical term) comes care of a pending decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission as to whether or not a bitcoin exchange–traded fund is in the world’s future. Yes, bitcoin, the official currency of the digital wild west, is trying to come to the capital markets, and the price surge seems to be based on the notion that a bitcoin-based ETF may work to tone down some of bitcoin’s more unpredictable tendencies. Unless, of course, it does the exact opposite. More on that in a second. “If approved, this would certainly give a dramatic condoning of bitcoin by the authorities and powers that be,” digital currency analytics firm Cryptocompare CEO Charles Hayter told Reuters. “Perhaps key would be the institutional money which would flow into bitcoin. This would bring a certain amount of stability eventually, but it could see short-term exuberance by retail traders.” Not everyone is so optimistic. Some are worried, for instance, about security risks surrounding a bitcoin-based ETF since hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin periodically go missing at the hands of hackers. (Remember Mt. Gox?) Others are pretty sure bitcoin just isn’t the right type of substance for an ETF. “Bitcoin is not a stock, it’s not a bond, it’s not a hard asset like precious metal, it’s not a commodity future. It’s a technology that’s very much in its infancy, and it’s not something that in my mind lends itself to being packaged as an ETF,” notes Ben Johnson, director of global ETF and passive strategies research at Morningstar Inc. Some are worried that it will just make bitcoin more prone to booms and busts that it already is. Bitcoin entrepreneur Vinny Lingham, for one, recently warned in a blog post that additional quick rises in bitcoin’s value will likely create another boom/bust cycle in the bitcoin ecosystem. A bubble that won’t hesitate to burst, if given the chance by, say, having the price peak over $3,000 too quickly. “Bitcoin is both scarce and valuable, which will lead to the price continuing to increase over time,” Lingham wrote. “But if that happens too quickly, we will enter another boom/bust cycle …. If it [bitcoin’s value] goes into the $3,000+ territory due to mania/short squeezes/media hype/FOMO and other triggers, then alarm bells will go off for me, and we’ll start approaching bubble territory.” The SEC has until Mar. 11 to decide the fate of the Winklevoss twins’ Bitcoin Trust, one of three proposed ETFs that could track the value of bitcoin. Whatever it decides will have little to do with bitcoin’s future as a global currency — as that fate has been decided a while ago (it’s dead). Sorry, Reddit fans. So what did we learn this week? Price talks. Rewards matter. Bitcoin doesn’t (much).

Cash usage fell in the early days of demonetisation due to note shortage, but as RBI’s presses cranked up, customers picked up their habits where they left them Subscribe to our newsletter. Sapna Agarwal The liquidity squeeze after demonetisation forced many people to report to digital payments, but RBI data shows people have not really embraced the new channels. Photo: Abhijit Bhatlekar/Mint Mumbai: Nearly four months after the crackdown on cash, the paper bills have bounced back. At Purushottam supermarket in Maharashtra’s Latur, cash transactions are back to previous levels. Cash usage fell in the early days of demonetisation amid a crippling currency shortage, admits its owner Ravindra Agarwal, but as the currency presses cranked up, customers picked up their habits where they left them.   “Customers prefer to pay cash for bills of Rs2,000-3,000,” says Agarwal, whose store accepts mobile, credit and debit card payments. Cash usage, which was close to 60-65% before demonetisation crashed in the first few weeks of cash shortage, before climbing back to the same level, says Agarwal. He also notes—like other shop owners—that customers are making fewer discretionary purchases. Five-hundred kilometre to the west, at India’s largest wholesale market in Mumbai’s Masjid Bunder, the story is the same. However, the cash preference here is from the trader’s end. “We started accepting Paytm wallets after the note ban, but have now stopped using it,” says Ravi Sangoi, 52, who has been running Bharat Bazaar mini wholesale and general store for 30 years. His reason: Paytm wallet transactions are free, but there is a 2% fee when the merchant transfers the wallet balance to his bank account. And shopkeepers want to avoid this. Like others Mint spoke to, Sangoi adds that sales remain depressed. “Consumers are not indulging. They buy as per need. Earlier, when a consumer entered the store, he didn’t hesitate to try something new, or an expensive soap or deodorant. Now he sticks to the bare minimum,” says Sangoi. Also read | Sectors which have been affected the most by demonetisation At Agarwal Enterprises, a large distributor of food flavours in the same market, owner Pawan Agarwal is more bitter: “Demonetisation was done the wrong way,” says Agarwal, who caters to makers of biscuits, ice creams and confectionaries. “The method and implementation were wrong. Also, the outcome was not achieved. There were no benefits. Smaller companies with local setup of one or two machines were unable to make a daily living following demonetisation.” The hit  In the December quarter, aggregate net sales of eight consumer goods companies across lifestyle, gems and jewellery, and value retail fell 2.9% from a year ago. In the same quarter, aggregate net profit of Shoppers Stop Ltd, Trent Ltd, Titan Co. Ltd, Gitanjali Gems Ltd, CESC Ltd that runs the Spencer’s retail chains, Bajaj Electricals Ltd, Videocon Industries Ltd and Bata India Ltd stood at Rs79.26 crore, down 84.1% from a year ago.  Consumer packaged goods makers were not spared either. Aggregate net profit for nine consumer staple companies fell 1.4%, while aggregate net sales grew marginally at 0.54%. The nine companies included Colgate-Palmolive (India) Ltd, Dabur India Ltd, Emami Ltd, Godrej Consumer Products Ltd, Hindustan Unilever Ltd, Marico Ltd, Nestlé India Ltd, Procter and Gamble Hygiene and Health Care Ltd, and Jyothy Laboratories Ltd. Clearly, consumers are not loosening their purse strings.  “People have cut back on their spends on electronics, apparel and household items. They are not indulging right now,” says Arvind Mediratta, managing director (MD) and chief executive officer (CEO) of organized wholesaler Metro Cash and Carry India Pvt. Ltd. The impact is worse in rural areas with a patchy banking coverage. “Two-wheeler sales are a good indicator of rural economy and they are yet to pick up,” says Mohan Ghatge, chairman and MD of Kolhapur-based Ghatge Patil Transports Ltd. He expects another six-eight months for the rural markets to pick up. “People in rural India are still not comfortable dealing with non-cash payment methods and also, the banking and formal sector has still not reached the last mile,” says Ghatge, a dealer for Hyundai Motor India Ltd, Daimler India Commercial Vehicles Pvt. Ltd and Mercedes-Benz India Pvt. Ltd.  Impact on SMEs “Demonetisation impacted consumers’ purchasing power,” says Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist and director at India Ratings and Research Pvt. Ltd. As bankers tackled demonetisation-related issues in the first two months, other banking operations stalled and some small and medium enterprises (SMEs) dependent on banking credit lines closed down in this period, says Sinha. The fallout, says Sinha is grave. As capacities remain underutilized, private sector investments have dried up. In December, India’s industrial production contracted by 0.4% on the back of demonetisation of high-value currencies. Capital goods, which is a proxy for investment demand in the economy, contracted 3% in December. The liquidity squeeze after the note ban forced many people to go digital. However, data from the Reserve Bank of India shows people have not really embraced the new channels. In fact, with cash taken away, they reined in spends.  Also read | Why a note in the hand is worth two in the account “You can’t force people to go cashless,” says Sinha. “You have to educate them and make them aware of the benefits. In the past too, the government assumed people would use toilets if it just built them under the Swachh Bharat programme. However, people continued to defecate in the open, forcing it to change its narrative to encourage people to use toilets.”  Parveen Dalal, head-sales (India business) and business (Saarc) at Godrej Consumer Products, says, “Demonetisation can’t work by itself but along with steps like the limit on cash transaction at Rs3 lakh and goods and services tax (GST), the evasion of taxes will reduce.” However, he says he is yet to see a significant shift in the way the trade works. India’s traditional trade accounts for 92% of the Rs2.6-trillion packaged goods industry and of this, nearly 40% is wholesale, which mostly transacts in cash at the lower level of the supply chain Amitabh Mall, partner and director at the Boston Consulting Group, India, points out, “There is a need for businesses to reinvent the traditional wholesale channel. This will require investments in training, hiring more people on distributors roles, and increasing the visits to B-class and C-class outlets.” In traditional supply chains, manufacturers appoint distributors who directly service retailers, apart from wholesalers who service retailers. However, wholesalers usually service smaller retailers not serviced by the large distributors or work in remote corners where the company-appointed distributor does not reach.  India’s traditional trade accounts for 92% of the Rs2.6-trillion packaged goods industry and of this, nearly 40% is wholesale, which mostly transacts in cash at the lower level of the supply chain. According to Mall, wholesalers operating on cash work on thin margins and their businesses could become unviable if they have to pay taxes or charges for use of digital payments.  Even in the Rs3.75 trillion apparel industry, the organized sector accounts for 35% of the overall trade. Here too, sales in the wholesale channel and smaller towns were more severely impacted than in urban India, Aditya Birla Fashion Retail Ltd, which owns brands like Van Heusen, Louis Philippe, Peter England and Allen Solly, said in a presentation on 3 February following its earnings announcement. Sales have recovered to about 90% of normal levels by end- December, said the company. ALSO READ | Are consumer goods firms prepared for GST regime? However, not all brand retailers have managed as well. “The recovery will depend on the individual strength of the brand. Some could be more impacted than others,” says Rahul Mehta, president of the Clothing Manufacturers Association of India, adding that in the long term, a lot of micro- level companies which were not a part of the official economy will have to shift to the official economy to survive. “The government’s demonetisation move had a pronounced impact on the unorganized retail sector,” says Rajat Wahi, partner and head (consumer markets) at KPMG India, as it is significantly cash-driven. However, even organized retailers in high-value items including luxury items and consumer durables witnessed contraction in revenues in the December quarter as they had a high dependency on cash. “Cash transactions in the luxury sector before demonetisation accounted for 60-70% of the total value,” says Wahi, adding that this is now changing as the consumers are using non-cash payment channels. Modern trade gains The unexpected beneficiaries though are the organized retailers, organized wholesale cash and carry, and even online marketplaces like Amazon and Flipkart. “This important step of demonetisation by the government together with introduction of GST in 2017 will be an inflexion point for the growth of modern retail and wholesale in the country,” says Krish Iyer, president and CEO of Walmart India, who feels that his company is well placed for growth for the next few years. “Modern trade is growing at a very fast rate for us at over 100%,” says Rodrigo Lima, MD at Danone India, who expects the channel’s contribution to grow from 10% of its overall sales to be close to 20% within a year. The modern trade channel made up for the slowdown in general trade and wholesale to some extent, says K.K. Chutani, executive director (consumer care business) at Dabur India. However, it is to be seen whether this is a temporary blip. “Demonetisation has led to a surge in the modern trade channels. But will this last,” wonders CEO of Jyothy Laboratories S. Raghunandan, who feels India’s traditional wholesalers are far more flexible, offer credit and doorstep delivery and order taking, and will be able to adapt to the changing environment to survive.

"All true histories contain instruction; though, in some, the treasure may be hard to find, and when found, so trivial in quantity that the dry, shrivelled kernel scarcely compensates for the trouble of cracking the nut." ― Anne Brontë in "Agnes Grey" "Today in Soap Opera History" is a collection of the most memorable, interesting and influential events in the history of scripted, serialized programs. From birthdays and anniversaries to scandals and controversies, every day this column celebrates the soap opera in American culture. On this date in... 1927: William J. Bell, iconic soap opera writer and producer who co-created The Young and the Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful, was born. He died on April 29, 2005 at age 78. To read some early articles on Bell and his wife Lee Phillip, click here and here. 1966: On Another World, Lee Randolph (Gaye Huston) informed Pat Matthews that she was taken with [Guiding Light's] Hope Bauer and enjoyed being with Hope's father, Mike Bauer, more than anyone she's ever known. 1979: On Ryan's Hope, Roger Coleridge (Ron Hale) tried to comfort this sister, Jillian (Nancy Addison), who begged to receive shots for her pain more often. Later, Jillian later bribed an orderly to bring her pain pills. Thanks to Jennifer for sending in the item above. 1979: On One Life to Live, Karen Wolek (Judith Light) admitted her past as a prostitute on the witness stand. Viki Buchanan (Erika Slezak) was on trial for murdering Marco Dane (Gerald Anthony). 1979: On Another World, John Randolph (Michael M. Ryan) died in a fire at Alice's cottage. 1980: On The Edge of Night, Draper (Tony Craig) was taken to state prison. 1984: On Guiding Light, Beth (Judi Evans) and Lillian (Tina Sloan) met with a girl who was being abused by a family member, and Mindy fretted about her pregnancy. 1986: On As the World Turns, Bob (Don Hastings) and Kim (Kathryn Hays) agreed to not keep anymore secrets from each other (Douglas Marland was head writer). 1986: On Knots Landing, Abby (Donna Mills) forced Olivia (Tonya Crowe) to tell her the truth after finding a joint in her purse. Meanwhile, Gary (Ted Shackelford) asked Abby for a divorce. 1991: On The Young and the Restless, Nina (Tricia Cast) took out her gun after she overheard David (Michael Corbett) say he was just using her. Douglas Marland 1993: Legendary soap opera scribe Douglas Marland died at age 58. He was head writer of As the World Turns at the time of his death, a position he had held for 8 years. He held previous jobs as the head writer at General Hospital, Guiding Light, The Doctors and Loving. He was also a co-creator of Loving and a writer for Another World. Just 7 weeks after his death, Soap Opera Digest published an article in the April 27, 1993 issue titled "How Not To Wreck A Show" in which Marland laid out the basic rules every soap writer should follow in order to be successful.. How Not To Wreck A Show * Watch the show. * Learn the history of the show. You would be surprised at the ideas that you can get from the back story of your characters. * Read the fan mail. The very characters that are not thrilling to you may be the audience's favorites. * Be objective. When I came in to ATWT, the first thing I said was, what is pleasing the audience? You have to put your own personal likes and dislikes aside and develop the characters that the audience wants to see. * Talk to everyone; writers and actors especially. There may be something in a character's history that will work beautifully for you, and who would know better than the actor who has been playing the role? * Don't change a core character. You can certainly give them edges they didn't have before, or give them a logical reason to change their behavior. But when the audience says, "He would never do that," then you have failed. * Build new characters slowly. Everyone knows that it takes six months to a year for an audience to care about a new character. Tie them in to existing characters. Don't shove them down the viewers' throats. * If you feel staff changes are in order, look within the organization first. P&G [Procter & Gamble] does a lot of promoting from within. Almost all of our producers worked their way up from staff positions, and that means they know the show. * Don't fire anyone for six months. I feel very deeply that you should look at the show's canvas before you do anything. * Good soap opera is good storytelling. It's very simple. 1995: On General Hospital, Felicia (Kristina Wagner) gave birth to Georgianna "Georgie" Jones at Luke's club in a room full of Port Charles residents. Thanks to Enrique for sending in the item above. 1997: Guiding Light began using a shortened 15-second version of the "Hold on to Love" opening sequence that debuted in 1992 Thanks to Na'Vell for sending in the item above. 2001: On The Bold and the Beautiful, Brooke (Katherine Kelly Lang) told Thorne (Winsor Harmon) she had to stop Rick and Amber's wedding, and get Amber out of Rick's life.

Many of the company’s products are now getting negative feedback from consumers and retailers (HT File Photo ) Many Patanjali products, promoted by yoga guru Ramdev, are reportedly getting “adverse feedback” from consumers and retailers, denting the company’s hope of doubling its revenue to Rs 10,000 crores in this fiscal. The Haridwar-based Patanjali Ayurved formed two internal committees at the behest of Ramdev to assuage the dissatisfaction of the retailers to address the problem. The idea is to keep retailers happy so that they “take care of the interest” of the company by retaining consumers. Established by Ramdev in 2006, Patanjali’s business journey so far has been impressive. From a humble beginning with Ayurveda products, the company now has array of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) on its portfolio. Of late questions were, however, being raised over the quality of some of its products. Patanjali ghee, noodles, honey are few that faced lab tests, giving enough fodder to the competitors and reason to consumers to doubt. The company also faced the ire of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) for ‘misbranding.’ The company refuted the charges. “Babaji’s (Ramdev) brand image is associated with the Patanjali products. There is no question of our products being inferior in quality,” claimed SK Tijarawala, spokesperson of the Patanjali. He, however, did not divulge details of the new arrangements being planned. “Not every Patanjali product is a huge success. Moreover, it lacked damage and expiry policy that causes loss to us,” said a Patanjali retailer.

But after Ramdev’s intervention two committees have been formed. One will look into the issues pertaining to the products that are nearing or have reached expiry dates. And the second committee will compensate retailers for those products that get damaged during the shipping. Besides, company is mulling to pass on certain amount of revenue to retailers across the country. Patanjali’s competitors like Dabur, Procter and Gamble, Nestle have strong distributor base. Off late the company realised this weakness. Despite the fact that Patanjali has got offers to expand business in Bangladesh, UAE, Iran, Azerbaijan etc – the company prefers to concentrate on domestic market. So far beyond India, Patanjali has entered only in Nepal, perhaps due to its managing director Balkrishna’s connection with the Himalayan state. “We are expanding fast in India and gradually will move overseas. We have zeroed in Suriname (a former Dutch colony) to expand base” Patanjali spokesperson Tijarawala added. tags Ramdev Patanjali FMCG products Patanjali ghee FSSAI more from dehradun Blamed for forest fires, pine needles to generate power Mar 06, 2017 20:37 IST Karnaprayag poll: Cong, BJP intensify campaign Mar 06, 2017 20:32 IST It’s time to be a sport, India Partnered feature Recommended for you India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Blogs Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Health & fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper HT Indepth Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

Joey Ochave, Nestor Tan, Gianna Montinola, and Maria Ressa are the awardees for this year's Aguhon Awards. MANILA, Philippines – Some men and women find themselves away from their homeland, but ultimately, choose to return and make a difference. The Aguhon Awards honors these men and women who have found their way home. An "aguhon" is an ancient mariner's compass, the world's oldest navigation instrument. "We wanted to honor those who are based in their home countries, creating an impact that ripples throughout Asia," said Maoi Arroyo, head organizer of the Aguhon Awards held Tuesday, February 28, at the Asian Institute of Management. This year's awardees are Filipinos who have made an economic, social, or cultural impact on the country and have all either worked or studied overseas. Read on for a glimpse of the journeys of Nestor Tan, Gianna Montinola, Joey Ochave, and Maria Ressa. Nestor Tan Nestor Tan, president and chief executive officer of BDO Unibank, told the audience that there was nothing heroic about his story. Tan stayed in the United States for 17 years, working for various banks there, and also stayed in Europe. It's been 20 years since he returned to the Philippines, not to change the country for the better, he said, but for "selfish reasons." "I wanted to be close to my parents. I want my children to grow up as Filipinos as well. And lastly, I got tired of ironing my own shirts," Tan said in his speech. But he did make a huge impact – especially for thousands of employees all over the country. Under Tan's leadership, BDO has grown to become the Philippines' largest bank. What's his recipe for success? Tan shared the following insights: Strive for excellence. "If you want to be a charity worker, be the best that is. If you want to be a banker, be the best that is. If you want to be a professor, be the best... If you do well in everything you do, the perks will come, they will follow." Have a good foundation. "I mean individually – in small things like work ethics, integrity, the ability to work well with people, and the lifelong learning that goes with it." Don't sweat the small stuff. "A lot of us do get hung up because we worry too much. We should only worry if we didn't do what should have been done." Follow your passion. "The hardest person to please is yourself," so stick to what you like. Success has many fathers and mothers. "Nobody's ever done it alone... and oftentimes we will get bypassed, sometimes ignored, but I believe that the truth catches out. So you may not get credit for a long time, then suddenly, it would all come because they will realize that you're a part of that success." Gianna Montinola Gianna Montinola has taken on many roles – lawyer, diplomat, business development manager, head of a non-governmental organization (NGO), and finally, an educator. "I had no grand plan. I just learned to seize the opportunities that came my way and to make the most of my choices," she said in her speech. Opportunities did keep coming for Montinola. After getting a college degree in the US, she came back to the Philippines to study law. She was a lawyer for a decade, focusing on intellectual property and commercial law. "My days were filled with trademark, patent, and copyright registrations, research, meetings with clients, and believe it or not, conducting raids on retail establishments selling fake goods," Montinola shared. Her legal career was interrupted only when she was sent to Lima, Peru as an honorary consul. "Almost overnight I had to learn how to issue visas, attend to the needs of Filipinos, and organize cultural events. I had to study the ways of protocol, and liaise with my supervising embassy in Brazil and Argentina, and with the Peruvian Department of Foreign Affairs." When her tour of duty ended, Montinola joined the business development and marketing team of Brockman Life Corporation. "It was here where I learned about product quality, to anticipate what a customer wants, and to provide excellent service." She then felt she had to give back. She co-founded Hands On Manila, an NGO which now has 30,280 volunteers. Hands On Manila's volunteers have helped 58,000 children, 2,000 senior citizens, 14 public schools, and 62 orphanages. In 2004, she joined Far Eastern University (FEU) as a consultant for marketing and communication. "Responsibility to deliver service that would help change lives close to 32,000 students from middle- and lower-income families was a serious one," she said. It was in 2007 when Montinola co-founded PeaceTech, an NGO dedicated to peacebuilding through the use of information communications technology. Almost a decade later, PeaceTech has touched the lives of almost 40,000 people through its Global Classroom Program. Montinola then returned to school and got her master's degree from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, which she said was a “daunting experience for someone in her 50s." After graduating, Montinola chose to return to FEU where she became the vice president for corporate affairs. "As a university, we are faced with the rapid, day-to-day changes of education. Resources like massive online courses… the internet… and the media which can instantly transport you to any part of the world. Many graduates will probably find employment in fields not related to the degree that they completed," she said. "These are the challenges we face today. There is still a lot of learning to be done." Joey Ochave Lawyer, chemical engineer, and Unilab senior vice president Joey Ochave said he had an unconventional path to leadership. His journey started in 1978, in high school, when he read about the country's history of resistance and joined the revolutionary movement. His early leadership days, he said, were during Martial Law when they fought the Marcos dictatorship. Everything he knows about marketing and management, he learned from his experiences then. "We knew deep in our hearts that we were fighting for what is right, and we started before Ninoy's assassination – before everyone wanted to be part of protest movements," he said. "What's a more difficult item to sell to people than a revolution – asking them to stake their lives for something that is as intangible as freedom, human rights, and self-determination?" After the EDSA People Power Revolution, Ochave made a move that he felt was "anathema to [his] comrades at the time" – he joined an American multinational company, Procter & Gamble (P&G). But then, it was where he also thought that he could do good. "Love of country and wanting to do good, it does not know any boundary. You can be in the government, you can be in the private sector, you can be anywhere and you can do good," he said. Ochave later left P&G to study law. He eventually joined Unilab, where he first handled legal affairs and is now SVP. Throughout his journey, Ochave was given many opportunities to travel the world. Yet ultimately, he chose to stay in the country and lead initiatives to deliver cheaper medicines to the public, such as RiteMed. "We wanted to change the discourse from 'bawal magkasakit kasi mahal ang gamot' (you're not allowed to get sick because medicine is expensive) to 'bawal ang mahal' (expensive is not allowed) because there is no reason for people not to afford medicine," he said. Ochave, like Tan, added there was nothing heroic about him. "We may look heroic in hindsight, but when we were anti-Martial Law activists, we were actually really scared. But it's okay to be scared, because that's the way to change the world." Maria Ressa Rappler CEO and executive editor Maria Ressa has witnessed different cycles of history as a journalist over the past 3 decades. She has also been through cycles of homecoming. Ressa was born in the Philippines and moved to the US shortly before martial law was declared. Her first homecoming happened in 1986, when she also lived through her first cycle of history: the democracy movement that started in the Philippines and rippled across the world. "While I was with CNN, it was an amazing and empowering time to be at the front seat and watch strongmen rulers give way to democracy. Such an amazing time," she said. Her second homecoming was in 2005, when Ressa finally chose to stay. "My family was in the States largely, but in 2005, what changed? I turned 40. I thought I needed a sense of home. I hated flying into the Philippines and being a foreigner watching," Ressa said. It was in her 40s that she wanted "help build something." At the time, Ressa said she felt like she was "young enough to believe she could make a difference and old enough to have real experience and actually make a difference." In 2006, Ressa said she could still feel the full gatekeeping powers of traditional journalism. At the time, journalists had control over all information distributed through available platforms. Ressa said it was in 2016 that technology changed countries, societies, governance, and democracies. "It began with Brexit, was followed by the election of Duterte in the Philippines, and of course, we ended it in November with the election of Trump in the United States," she said. And while social media has been used to get the wisdom of the crowd, it's also where lynch mobs have increasingly launched attacks. "The first targets were institutions that became weaker. The second targets were individuals," Ressa said. "We showed you how 26 fake accounts can actually influence and mislead up to 3 million Facebook pages. Only 26!" (READ: Propaganda war: Weaponizing the internet) "It's clear there is an effort to tear down institutions. We are trampling the rule of law. How can you say we're not when more than 7,000 people have been killed in 7 months?" she added. Where is the Philippines heading now? Ressa said it is time to recalculate. (READ: #InspireCourage: Our pledge) "What's clear is that information will again turn the world views. Question is, are we going to be satisfied with creating these echo chambers, or are we going to bridge? ... This country really can't move if it doesn't come together," she said. "We don't know where it's headed. What I do know is that this is a primeval moment to be Filipino. It is also an amazing time to be a journalist." – Rappler.com Filed under:Gianna Montinola•Joey Ochave•Maria Ressa•Nestor Tan•success stories•Aguhon Awards HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?
