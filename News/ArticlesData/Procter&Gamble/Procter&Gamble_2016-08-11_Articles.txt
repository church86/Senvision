Olympics sponsors want nothing to do with Team USA shooters (Bloomberg)—If Team USA's Kim Rhode wins a medal in skeet shooting Friday, she will claim a piece of Olympic history: the 37-year-old Californian will be the first woman to take the podium in six straight Olympics. Landing a big-name sponsor might be the bigger feat. In the year leading up to Rio 2016, Rhode's agent Patrick Quinn pitched her to around 20 companies that back the Olympics. None were convinced. “The big mystery is how someone like Kim isn't part of the Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, and the Olympics sponsor push,'' Quinn said by phone from Chicago.“It would be nice to have an Olympic sponsor recognize the magnitude of her accomplishment.'' Coca-Cola Co. and Procter & Gamble Co. didn't respond to a request for comment, but Rhode or other shooters on Team USA think the reason is obvious. The rise in gun violence and mass shootings in the US have attached a stigma to shooting as a sport, they say. So while companies like Winchester, Beretta and Otis Technology support Rhode, she doesn't have a single sponsor from outside the firearm industry. The same is true for USA Shooting, even though the sport has since 2000 been the fifth-highest medal producer for the US team at Summer Olympics. The very first gold medal for any sport awarded in Rio went to 19-year-old Ginny Thrasher, competing in her Olympics debut. The first Olympic Gold medalist of #rio2016 is USA's Air Rifle shooter Virginia Thrasher! #ShootingSport pic.twitter.com/dCv8611YCc— ISSF (@ISSF_Shooting) August 6, 2016 Politics may only tell part of the story. American television audiences don't tend to watchshooting – or, for that matter, a number of other sports. “The biggest challenge is limited exposure,” said Peter Carlisle, head of the Olympic Sports and Action division at Octagon Worldwide. “If the sport itself doesn't provide a consistent platform for the athletes to become recognizable and maintain relevance, there's limited value to a sponsor.” What's more, noted Scott Becher, the executive vice president of sports and entertainment at Zimmerman Advertising, a lot of Americans own firearms, so the potential affinity exists. A COSTLY SPORT The difference for shooters is the cost of training. Competition-level firearms price between $8,000-20,000. Between ammunition, clay pigeons and range fees, a day of training can run as high as $450. “It really adds up,'' said Vincent Hancock, one of Rhode's teammates. “I've only found two sports that are more expensive -- anything to do with a horse, and car racing.'' The US Olympic Committee helps foot the bill. Because of shooting's high potential to medal, USA Shooting received $2.5 million in 2015, third-most among summer sports behind swimming and track and field. Still, the ammunition provided by the federation doesn't always cover athlete's needs. The day before departing for Rio, for example, Rhode shot 450 targets, she said. SIMILAR CHALLENGES As for Hancock, on Saturday he will attempt to win a gold medal in his third consecutive Olympics for skeet shooting. Even as one of the sport's favorites, Hancock still struggles to prevail upon potential backers who aren't tied in some way to the firearm industry. “A lot of times they say, well, we really like you, you're great and your credentials speak for themselves, but we're not sure how we can really fit you in,'' Hancock said. “It seems like they want to, but don't want to get caught up in the media backlash that may arise if something were to come about with, say, one of the shootings.'' Shooters in other countries have faced similar challenges. Even in Italy, where the national shooting federation claims about 500,000 members – its US counterpart has about 5,250 – the team struggled to transcend sponsors' fears about firearms. “You talk about rifles and pistols and people are afraid, especially in Europe with the recent terrorism,'' said Luciano Rossi, an Italian senator who is also president of the country's shooting federation, and also vice-president of the international shooting federation. “We must offer a new image of our sport. If the spectators know our sport, they understand and love us, and if they love us, the sponsors come.''

A verba publicitária investida na ferramenta de segmentação de público será redirecionada para outras opções do Facebook. Segundo o diretor de marketing da P&G, Marc Pritchard, o investimento no recurso, um dos mais caros do Facebook, não estava garantindo resultados uma vez que acabava por deixar de mostrar resultados para outros públicos. O esquema de segmentação da audiência da rede social permite que o anunciante mire em consumidores específicos. No caso da Procter & Gamble, empesa dona de uma vasta gama e produtos domésticos, era possível anunciar fraldas para futuros pais ou purificador de ar para donos de animais, por exemplo. A marca usou a segmentação por dois anos, mas os resultados mostraram uma estagnação nas vendas, o que a levou a repensar a estratégia de anúncio digital. Para o Wall Street Journal, um porta-voz do Facebook afirmou que o movimento é natural. De acordo com ele, a relação entre as duas empresas sempre foi de aprendizado mútuo.

"Following" : "Follow"}} August 11, 2016 5:08pm   Comments Share: Related PG Benzinga's Top Initiations Wall Street's M&A Chatter From November 11-13 P&G caught in river rights feud (Seeking Alpha) Deutsche Bank's Bill Schmitz commented on Procter and Gamble's (NYSE: PG) new turnaround strategy, while taking back market share and re-strengthening its core brands. The analyst maintained his Buy rating and $95 price target. "After several years of organic growth disappointments and relative under performance, company is taking off the kid gloves and aggressively reinvesting across brands, categories, countries and channels to get things moving in the right direction," said Schmitz. The Deutsche Bank analyst cited category growth improvements, margin enhancements driven by volume growth and guidance for providing "plenty of cushion" making Proctor and Gamble "a relative winner, boosting earnings growth and multiple." After meeting with management, Schmitz thought Procter and Gamble was putting in significant effort to have a balance between growth and profitability. The Deutsche Bank analyst added, "Our take away, reading between the lines, is that this is the year company is going to make up for lost time, investing aggressively in advertising, innovation, channels and sales coverage to get the top line moving again, armed with $0.50 or more of earnings cushion relative to guidance to make the magic happen again." Throwback to 2001 Shmitz thought the strategy "smelled" a lot like 2001-2004 when Proctor and Gamble went on its "last innovation and marketing driven land grab which was also, not surprisingly, the last time the company grew well above peers and the stock relatively outperformed the group." Shmitz is among the best analyst's covering Proctor and Gamble with a 78 percent success rate and a +12.5 percent average return per recommendation. The analyst is ranked 63 out of 4110 analysts. Proctor and Gamble traded at $86.73, up 0.49 percent Thursday.

P&G moving 850 jobs Downtown Bowdeya Tweh , btweh@enquirer.com 8:37 a.m. EDT August 13, 2016 Buy Photo Procter & Gamble headquarters in downtown Cincinnati (Photo: Enquirer file/Cara Owsley)Buy Photo Procter & Gamble is relocating 850 workers to Downtown Cincinnati from its Winton Hills campus about 10 miles away. P&G officials told employees about the move previously, but the company confirmed the plans to media Friday. The move is expected to begin in fall 2017. Of the 850 employees, contractors and suppliers at the Winton Hill Business Center that will move, 750 are P&G employees and 100 are contract workers, the company said. The Cincinnati-based consumer products giant is locating people inside P&G's Central Building on Sixth Street between Sycamore Street and Broadway, which company officials said has been underused. The vacant third and fourth floors are being renovated for the relocated workers, P&G spokesman Jeff LeRoy said. Most of the people being relocated Downtown work in Procter & Gamble's product supply organization, which handles planning and logistics for the company's North American operations. "The Winton Hill campus will retain portions of our baby, family and feminine care businesses, some of which are in Cincinnati and some of which are in the Finneytown neighborhood of Springfield Township," according to a company statement. The move doesn't change P&G's total headcount in Cincinnati. P&G employs about 10,000 people in Greater Cincinnati. The Winton Hills campus has about 18 buildings and the relocated employees will be vacating two of them, LeRoy said. He said the company wants to sell those buildings, but it has about 18 months to consider its options.

SmartCommerce provides unique, brand-focused solutions that help build brand-customer connections in the rapidly changing CPG marketplace. Related Media Products, not experience, drive Millennials to online shopping Consumer expectations are driving rapid and exciting change in the retail environment. Omnichannel, always-on shopping behavior is increasingly becoming the norm, and technology solutions like buy online pick-up in store (BOPIS), Instacart and AmazonFresh are taking off because they are tailored to meet the needs of today’s "omnishoppers.” The key is that shopping behaviors including product discovery, selection and ordering are no longer discrete activities that only occur in stores; they are integrated into everyday life. Run out of mayonnaise while making a sandwich? Quickly drop that into your online shopping cart while you’re thinking about it. See an ad for new storage bags that would be perfect for sending your kids to camp? Click to buy them now. Discover a great mixer at a party? Don’t try to remember it the next time you go to the store — add it to your Instacart list on your smartphone. That’s “omnishopping,” and based on our research, it’s happening across all demographics and geographies. The old paradigm depended on brand target customers remembering the products they wanted during weekly shopping trips, but the omnishopper model rewards brands and retailers who bring the store to the shopper. This is achieved by keeping a cart close by at all times to “catch” impulse buys as they occur throughout the day. Delighting omnishoppers requires a new cooperation between brands and retailers, which may initially seem uncomfortable to both until they realize they’re leaving their old school competitors in the dust. Brands drive most of the out-of-store discovery of their product through marketing efforts like ads, social media, public relations and so on; each of these digital touchpoints should be cart-enabled, with direct connections to the retailers most relevant to each individual shopper. Retailers make up the fulfillment part of the process and should make this process as frictionless as possible. They can find ways to make it super easy for shoppers to collect products digitally, and receive them how/when it best fits their needs from numerous options like local delivery, curbside pickup or subscription box deliveries. Omnishopper nirvana is when shoppers feel almost like they just have to think about wanting a product and it’s dropped in a cart for them, and that products seem to magically appear in their lives at just the right time. With smartphones, new IoT tools and emerging B2B services, we have the technology to make this a reality. Expect to see the brands and retailers who drive this change get disproportionately rewarded.

Banco Popolare: precisazione su notizie stampa In primo piano P&G, meno pubblicità su Facebook –di Marco Valsania 11 agosto 2016 Facebook, il re della pubblicità digitale assieme a Google, subisce la defezione del leader mondiale assoluto nelle inserzioni, Procter & Gamble. Una defezione relativa: il big dei prodotti di largo consumo ha deciso che tirerà i remi in barca sugli “spot” dedicati a specifici consumatori, che le sue ricerche hanno dichiarato inefficaci, mantenendo però invariata la voce del budget destinata al social network. Ma è un ritiro che scotta ugualmente: mette in discussone uno dei principali pilastri dell’appeal di Facebook per i grandi marchi, i rivoluzionari strumenti sviluppati dal 2007 in avanti con l’obiettivo di raggiungere audience sempre più segmentate per abitudini, gusti, caratteristiche demografiche e quant’altro. Peccato, ha sentenziato ora P&G dall’alto di una spesa mondiale in pubblicità di oltre 7 miliardi l’anno, che questa articolata “piattaforma” non funzioni affatto così facilmente, nè per pannolini e sapone da bucato, nè per i rasoi o le necessità dei neoproprietari di case. «Troppo targeting e un focus troppo ristretto», ha commentato il responsabile del marketing di P&G al Wall Street Journal. Svelando, forse, segreti di Pulcinella gelosamente custoditi dai colossi della new economy: non è tutto automaticamente trasformabile in oro ciò che luccica sull’autostrada elettronica. Ed eccedere nei social media può far male anche a chi vuole coltivare con intelligenza i cittadini nei panni di consumatori. L’interrogativo, per Pritchard e P&G, riguarda così oggi la ricerca di un inedito ed elusivo equilibrio in strategie tuttora in evoluzione sui new media: «Come avere sia il maggior raggio d’azione possibile che la corretta precisione». Perchè, pur con tutti i dubbi e le necessarie correzioni di rotta, Fb alla stregua di Google con la sua espansione è ormai diventato un ineludibile canale pubblicitario per la Corporate America: con i suoi 1,7 miliardi di utenti al mondo genera una raccolta annuale di 17,04 miliardi di dollari (+49% in un anno). «La nostra partnership con P&G - precisa in una nota Facebook - cresce ogni anno nell'offerta di servizi di advertising efficienti ed efficaci. I nostri clienti ci dicono che questa strategia funziona perché siamo in grado di fornire al pubblico giusto la pubblicità giusta, in una scala senza precedenti». © Riproduzione riservata Argomenti: Pubblicità 0 commenti Partecipa alla discussione Annulla Disclaimer Pubblica 0 Commenti | Aggiorna Vedi tutti i commenti Carica altri commenti I più letti di Finanza & Mercati Ultime novità Dal catalogo del Sole 24 Ore Scopri altri prodotti Le gallery più viste Motori24 16 novembre 2016 Alfa Romeo Stelvio, tutte le foto del debutto a Los Angeles Motori24 19 novembre 2016 Jeep Compass, tutte le foto della seconda generazione Motori24 16 novembre 2016 Alfa Romeo Stelvio, ecco le foto del primo suv del biscione Motori24 7 novembre 2016 Eicma 2016, le foto delle moto al debutto Motori24 17 novembre 2016 L'improbabile megasuv con i gradini per entrare Foto 15 Luxury 23 novembre 2016 La Sicilia del buon gusto, 15 tappe con le Soste di Ulisse 32 Luxury 23 novembre 2016 Il grand opening di Palazzo Versace Hotel & Resort a Dubai 11 Arte 23 novembre 2016 Chris Ware: Il Palazzo della Memoria.

The Enquirer looks back on FC Cincinnati's humble beginnings. The Enquirer/Pat Brennan FC Cincinnati transitioned into its permanent home on the third floor of 14 E. Fourth St. in downtown Cincinnati in late September. (Photo: Provided/Jeff Berding) No office space. Speculative earnings models. A brand new lease to play soccer in the University of Cincinnati's football stadium, but no players to take the field. No coach to coach the imaginary squad. Forget Major League Soccer – this newly-founded United Soccer League project needed colors and a logo. That was Futbol Club Cincinnati as recently as spring 2015. Friday marks one year since FC Cincinnati went public, and most have come to appreciate the team within the context of raucous scenes at Nippert Stadium this spring and summer. In the short time some fans have been tuned in, the club's grabbed international attention for their skyrocketing attendance figures. They're the third division outfit that drew 35,061 for a friendly against a trendy English Premier League club. Most of all, FC Cincinnati's the startup franchise that's injected itself into the MLS expansion conversation. CINCINNATI.COM FC Cincinnati receives praise at MLS All-Star Game But FC Cincinnati's path to success was forged when almost no one here was looking, before almost anyone knew soccer was coming to the Queen City. It wasn't that long ago the club's future was being etched out in note pads by four men working out of East Side coffee shops. A fridge full of beer: FC Cincinnati’s first employee and the pre-launch days It was clear FC Cincinnati would be a "go" for 2016 as the team polished off its 15-year lease to play at Nippert Stadium in spring 2015. But there was work to do through the summer months leading up to the planned August launch, and President and General Manager Jeff Berding wasn't leaving his post with the Cincinnati Bengals' front office until Aug. 3. Enter Dan McNally, the club’s first-ever full-time employee. McNally was hired by Berding in May 2015. He carried the torch on a number of initiatives through the summer as Berding finished out his time with the Bengals. McNally studied the USL's best practices thoroughly, researched housing for FC Cincinnati players and helped birth concepts like The Bailey, the supporters section in Nippert's north end (originally, the section was slated to be called "The Legion." Nippert's horseshoe end would eventually receive that title). With no office space to call his own, McNally built a foundation for the club while working out of Cincinnati coffee shops. Bruegger's Bagels on Columbia Parkway in Mount Lookout was a favorite work space for him. Berding also hosted meetings at his home in the early mornings and evenings and, eventually, the crowd around Berding's kitchen table grew to four main players. McNally and Berding were joined by ticketing and Nippert guru Jeff Smith, formerly UC's associate athletic director, and Gary De Jesus, a brand building expert from Procter and Gamble. De Jesus worked on consumer studies for the club and was instrumental in crafting the team’s colors and logos. Combined, these four were the early, proverbial "boots on the ground" for FC Cincinnati. They kept a shared vision for club moving in the right direction, Berding said. “We would meet a couple of times a week, famously in Jeff’s kitchen,” McNally said. “For a guy like myself from the northwest of England where soccer is everything, the idea of building a professional franchise is inspiring because there was nothing we couldn’t discuss. Every thought that we had between ourselves was worth discussing.” Berding’s fridge was always filled with beer – “He never let us down there. Always happy with the beer,” McNally said – but the meetings were still structured and professional. “Literally, there were four of us around a kitchen table and, I think, that’s a pretty strong comparison of where we started off from with great ambition and potential,” McNally said. “It was an inspiring time. You don’t get many opportunities in your life to be part of a startup with such ambition. “Having a beer. Building a professional soccer franchise," McNally said, laughing. Launch day and beyond After almost two decades on the job, Berding walked out of Paul Brown Stadium for the final time as a Bengals employee Aug. 3, 2015 – a mere nine days before FC Cincinnati went public.  (Photo: Provided/Jeff Berding) “Up until the last day, I tried to give an honest effort,” Berding said. “When I left, I joked that, ‘well, I have one job now’ because I was trying to pull all this (FC Cincinnati) stuff together while maintaining my commitment to the Bengals organization.” With McNally's assistance, the short gap between Berding's jobs didn't inhibit FC Cincinnati's ability to throw a notable launch ceremony. The  U.S. soccer community sat up and took notice when Carl Lindner III and John Harkes were introduced as the principle owner and head coach, respectively. Rumors circulated in soccer circles about those involved in FC Cincinnati, but few learned of Lindner's and Harkes' involvement until the launch news conference. “We were shooting for the moon with the launch," Berding said of the impact of the launch, which featured USL higher-ups, Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley and others. "We were going to send a message that we were going to do something completely different than had ever been suggested before in Cincinnati." FC Cincinnati made its desired launch-day splash, but there was still much work to be done. FC Cincinnati remained less a sports franchise and more a concept at this point. With the USL season about seven months away, pressure ratcheted up and things began to take shape across the organization. • In late September, the club transitioned its business operation into its permanent home in the third floor of 14 E. Fourth St. in late September, and more staff was added to fill out the space. • With the brick and mortar in place, Berding started to gain ground as the club’s general manager and began signing players. • McNally broadened his scope as vice president of operations to include the team’s travel arrangements, and locker room and player lounge layouts, among other things. • Mario Cicchinelli, head of sponsorships and corporate partnerships, helped Berding land the club's first sponsorship deals. UC Health signed on as the presenting sponsor and Toyota partnered with the club as its jersey, or "kit," sponsor. Dozens of additional partnerships would follow. • The first crop of player signings was introduced in November (and went on to comprise the majority of FC Cincinnati's current starting lineup). The club also held its first-ever open tryout the week before Thanksgiving. Successes were snowballing and it would soon carry over to the field. 'Divine providence': The USL season begins Even in preseason, it felt to some like special things were happening with FC Cincinnati. Something was up with this team. For the team’s first-ever game, a Feb. 21 preseason match against KR Reykjavic of Iceland, locals packed bars on both sides of the Ohio River to watch a shoddy livestream of an essentially meaningless game. Midfielder Corben Bone scored a surreal goal that would go on to be featured on ESPN that night. Then FC Cincinnati won the IMG Academy Suncoast Pro Classic, which included a late victory against star-studded New York City FC of MLS – more reason for the soccer-viewing public to take notice. In interviews, Carl Lindner III used the phrase "divine providence" to encapsulate this kind of inexplicable energy, excitement and success around the team. More and more, the team seemed preordained to be successful and make an impact. FC Cincinnati's first USL game was forgettable. The team lost, weather delayed the start and most could only view it on YouTube. But then the April 9 home opener against Charlotte Independence arrived. On a cold night, 14,658 packed into Nippert. Forward Sean Okoli scored a stunning, highlight reel goal in the first half, but it was the game-winning goal by Cincinnati native Austin Berry in the second half that signaled to McNally the first-year club had already achieved something special. "With Austin's diving header, I just looked up in the stands and said, 'this is it.' This is what we wanted to achieve," McNally said. "Everything about that night - that was the new standard." Since then, FC Cincinnati's shattered single-game and season attendance records for USL. The team is also a top competitor entering the home stretch of the USL's regular season. Year Two: More youth programs and possible new training ground FC Cincinnati's front office is already beginning to plan for its offseason, although there's still the matter of the USL playoffs to contend with. At this point, FC Cincinnati is a virtual lock to qualify for the Eastern Conference's eight-team, knockout-style tournament format. But once they get to the offseason, this much is certain: FC Cincinnati will expand aspects of its operation in year two. It's a matter of how much can be accomplished between November and January, McNally said. Nippert's soccer-minded renovations are scheduled to begin after UC's football team completes its slate of home games. That should begin in November with the upgrades tentatively scheduled to be ready by around April 1, Berding said. Expanding youth programming and improving the Cincinnati’s first-team training facilities – both issues that were researched during FC Cincinnati’s recent fact-finding mission at MLS All-Star Game in San Jose – will be emphasized this coming winter. Berding told The Enquirer Wednesday that former Wake Forest men’s soccer coach Nate Kish was added to FC Cincinnati’s technical staff in July. He'll act as a member of the coaching staff and head of scouting. Kish will look to build on the club’s first-ever foray into youth programming, which took place in July and saw some of the top-recommended youth players in Greater Cincinnati train with FC Cincinnati’s first team. The hope is to have a more structured summer program by next summer, but not a year-round development academy quite yet, Berding said. Upgrading FC Cincinnati's practice environment for 2017 is also a priority. Berding said he’s been approached by multiple parties about possible off-site training grounds, but added he and McNally aren’t close to making a decision about practice facilities for next season. Training at Nippert, as the club has this season, is still on the table. Improvements in these areas, particularly at Nippert and in the area of youth programming, would advance FC Cincinnati's increasingly strong argument for MLS expansion. Berding also mentioned another potential addition for the near future, pending on-field results. "We’ll have a trophy case here before too long," he said. 284 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE TOP VIDEOS Dodgers great Ralph Branca dies at 90 1:15 Top five college football games to watch in Week 13 2:20 Achieving the Dream - Charles Woodson 3:40 Statistical oddities from the NBA's first month 1:52 Why the Los Angeles Clippers are rolling 1:36 Notre Dame to vacate football wins from 2012 and 2013 1:15 Bruce Arena replaces Jurgen Klinsmann as USMNT coach 1:07 Celeb Pick 'Em with Miles Teller 3:25 How the NFL playoff picture looks after Week 11 1:37 NBA weekend in review: Clippers continue to roll 1:40 Doug Baldwin speaks out on community policing 3:32 Jurgen Klinsmann fired as USMNT coach 0:48 Week 11 NFL hot reads: Redskins building solid foundation 2:36 Jimmie Johnson wins record-tying seventh Sprint Cup title 1:00 Week 12 Amway Coaches Poll 1:14 NFL players must battle altitude and pollution in Mexico City 2:41 Numbers to know for the Chase for the Sprint Cup 1:23 Who is the favorite to win the Sprint Cup title? 1:08 What to watch for in Sprint Cup race at Homestead 1:27 Lorenzo's Locks: Week 11 NFL picks 1:59 Punting tips and dance moves with Marquette King 1:00 Reflecting on Tony Stewart's legacy in NASCAR 2:52 A timeline of Johnny Manziel’s troubled history 2:02 Fighters square off at UFC Fight Night 100 faceoffs 1:14 Mets pitcher Jeurys Familia pleads not guilty to domestic violence charge 0:50

Earlier this week, Simone and Team USA won a second consecutive team gold medal. Biles grew up in gymnastics, competing as a level 8 gymnast at the age of 10. By age 14, she had made her mark as an elite junior gymnast, finishing third in the all-around American Classic. Raised by her grandmother and grandfather, she was encouraged not to allow anything or anyone to stop her from attaining success. The very next year, she topped the medal podium with gold medals at not only the American Classic, but the Alamo Classic, the Houston National Invitational and the Secret U.S. Classic. Photo credit: Instagram – @SimoneBiles In 2013, she shined bright with all-around gold at the U.S P&G Championship and became the first African American Woman to win the all-around gold medal at the World Championship. In 2014 she was a repeat success, taking home gold at the World Championship in all-around competition, as well as the Secret U.S. Classic. In 2015, Biles became the first woman to win three consecutive World Championships and she earned her 10th gold medal, making her one of the world’s top gymnasts. Photo credit: Instagram – @SimoneBiles Biles qualified for the all-around competition after receiving scores of 15.6 on beam, 15.7 on floor, 16.0 on vault and 15.0 on uneven bars in the qualifying rounds of the Rio Olympic Games. With her teammates cheering her on and everything on the line, she claimed the top spot on the Olympic podium. Over the years, Biles developed a signature move, which is the double flip with a half twist that is remarkable and helped guide her throughout her road to Rio. Her beautiful smile and powerful gymnastic routines lead her through this year’s Olympic Games giving people around the world something to be proud of. With so much passion and dedication, she is truly a pleasure to watch and inspiration for generations to come.

According to several former workers, roughly 70 employees were laid off at the end of July. The company, headquartered in Seattle, has eight locations in the United States, including New York, Denver and Atlanta. Its past clients include Procter & Gamble and Build-A-Bear. Possible was passed over for an $11 million contract with Smuckers, a company with which Possible has done business for at least 5 years. According to an April article in Ad Age, the J.M. Smucker Co. conducted a digital review of all 29 of its domestic brands, including the flagship Smucker's line. One former employee said the loss of the Smucker contract was "the last straw." Smucker did not respond to Enquirer requests for an interview. Management at Possible declined to be interviewed regarding the layoffs. "We have no comment on this subject," said Tony Desjardins, managing director of Possible Cincinnati. 73 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2bcChHF TOP VIDEOS Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 22 17:46 Joe Deters asks for retrial of Ray Tensing, seeks change of venue 3:07 Black Friday secrets the stores don't want you to know 1:01 Finding home: A 12-year-old boy's search in the midst of war 6:41 Bills-Bengals postgame wrap 3:10 Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 Use-of-force expert: 'The actions of Ray Tensing were justified' 0:50 Which stores are opening, closing Thanksgiving Day 0:34 \u0022I can't wait to see Tensing on the stand\u0022 0:55 Cincinnati Police Criminalist: Tensing 'seemed nervous or afraid' 2:59 Jobs Report FedEx is set to hire 500 workers in Greater Cincinnati for the holidays Fatima Hussein Ohio, Ky. and other states challenge US on OT rule Fatima Hussein Cincinnati region's jobless rate steady in August Fatima Hussein Ohio unemployment rate rises as state loses jobs Fatima Hussein Kentucky employment dips slightly in August Fatima Hussein Burger King, Popeyes franchisee hiring 500 workers Fatima Hussein This story is part of Jobs Report FedEx is set to hire 500 workers in Greater Cincinnati for the holidays Ohio, Ky. and other states challenge US on OT rule Cincinnati region's jobless rate steady in August

Spyros Lekkakos August 12, 2016 | CFO.com | US - Comments: 8 share Tweet Email Print - Print + Email this article To* Please enter your email address* Subject* Comments* Extending payment terms to 120 days or more frees up working capital for big companies. But it can also increase the financial stress on suppliers and ultimately lead to increased product costs. Although the tactic has attracted much criticism, research underway at the Zaragoza Logistics Center, Zaragoza, Spain, shows that delaying payments to creditors can actually benefit both buyers and suppliers. Spyros Lekkakos The number of large enterprises that have imposed less generous payment terms on suppliers has increased markedly over recent years. A recent article in the New York Times notes that European spirits company Diageo pays its bills in 90 days, and Mondelez, Mars, and Kellogg take 120 days to pay suppliers’ invoices. “The list of companies doing the same reads like a grocery store version of Who’s Who,” said the New York Times. By paying suppliers much later than previously, big companies can unlock cash in their supply chains. In 2013 Procter & Gamble introduced a 75-day payment period for suppliers, and added an estimated $1 billion to the company’s cash flow, reported the New York Times. But for many suppliers the tactic is a bitter pill to swallow, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). These companies are particularly vulnerable to market volatility, and are often unable to find cheap external financing owing to the continued fallout from the 2008 global financial crisis. It seems that SMEs have little choice but to make the best of an unfavorable situation, but there are better alternatives. In 2010 Unilever extended its payment terms from 30 days to 90 days. Even though industry was still reeling from the aftermath of the 2008 meltdown, Unilever achieved an increase in total turnover of 25%, as well as 50% and 60% increases in operating profit and investments in fixed assets within a three-year time frame. Moreover, while there were rumblings of discontent when the change was announced, supplier protests were relatively muted. The reason is that Unilever invested the funds freed up by its extended payment program in its supply chain. The efficiencies captured by Unilever were passed on to suppliers in the form of higher order volumes — in effect, a win-win. The availability of supply chain finance instruments such as reverse factoring (RF) also made it possible for Unilever to extend payment terms without punishing suppliers. RF is a vehicle for giving suppliers — especially SMEs — access to affordable financing. In a typical arrangement, a large company (the buyer) commits to paying invoices promptly to the factor (a bank) and the factor agrees to pay the supplier earlier than the due dates on its invoices to the buyer. The bank profits by charging fees for the service, the buyer benefits from the extended payment terms, and the supplier is able to get paid earlier and improve its cash-flow position. Most academic RF models show that when buyers associate their RF programs with terms extension, the value for their supply chain is lower than that achieved without the extension strategy. However, recent ZLC research shows that when the cost of raising funds — in the form of debt or equity — is high for buyers, extending payment terms can be economically efficient as long as the freed up cash is productively used. One such use: plant and equipment investment. There are many creative versions of RF financing. ZLC research shows that for SMEs, the instrument improves operational performance, mitigates the impact of market volatility on cash flow, and offers the potential to unlock more than 10% of an enterprise’s working capital. The RF route also has some significant downsides, however. It is effective when the credit spread is large. But when this is not the case, suppliers are advised to look for other sources of financing. And, of course, RF services come at a cost for both the buyer and the supplier. Therefore, when evaluating RF options, suppliers should keep in mind that the direct benefits gained from improved service levels and profitability are not the only factors they need to consider. They should also assess how the capital freed up by these programs can be put to work in other ways. The emergence of new variations on the RF theme, including open platforms that provide a wider choice of competing sources of finance, could change these tradeoffs. In addition, new fintech models such as blockchain have the potential to disrupt the RF market. There is a growing need for insights into better ways to manage working capital. The recently released annual working capital survey by REL, a division of The Hackett Group, which looks at the performance of 1,000 of the largest U.S. public companies during 2015, concludes: “Overall working capital performance continued to degrade, reaching poorest performance levels since the 2008 financial crisis.” Spyros Lekkakos, is a postdoctoral research fellow, at the Zaragoza Logistics Center, Zaragoza, Spain.

Sounds like the rich getting richer. You have the product, you have the money, so pay up. Stop using the little man’s money to make your money. Spin it the way you want, but to me this is BS. I guess paying bills properly has changed. Sounds like a Trump idea. Reply Tom Walsh said 08/17/16 20:18pm Obviously the author has not operated a business. We have many large customers pushing us out to 90 and 120 days before being paid, this makes it extremely hard on a business with 50 to 70 employees who are paid weekly, taxes that need to be paid weekly or face stiff government penalties. We have suppliers who also need to be paid. It only benefits the big multinationals who can afford to pay but do not. Cash flow is the lifeblood of a business, regardless of how well the financial statements look, if there is no cash on hand it spells the death of a business. Of course the banks may like this as well, as small businesses dig deep into their line of credit to finance day to day operations. Maybe the author can tell his employer he can wait 90 to 120 days for his paycheque? I would like to see how he feels about this after having to wait this long to get payment for services rendered. Reply Vince said 08/18/16 06:00am Absolute BS to make the big companies feel better. You are screwing your suppliers using antiquated means. Get your own financial house in order and stop taking it out on your supplierd Reply Deb said 08/22/16 09:51am We are a SME and a client, who is part of a rather large entity, “offered” to pay in terms that turned out to be reverse factoring. Unbeknownst to us, there is a UCC filing connected to this arrangement. Our lender objected to it and almost pulled our line of credit. Another example of a big company sticking it to the little guy. Reply Keith Hallam said 08/23/16 20:31pm It’s bullshit! Big fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite ’em. Little fleas have smaller fleas and so ad infinitum…. Just pay up and on time. Reply Spyros Lekkakos said 08/24/16 12:34pm Thank you all for your comments and for giving me the opportunity to resolve some misunderstandings. First, the article does not claim that extending payment terms to SME suppliers is something good. On the contrary, it clearly states that “when buyers associate their RF programs with terms extension, the value for their supply chain is lower than that achieved without the extension strategy” (actually, I have already published a paper that shows this: http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/IJPDLM-07-2014-0165). In other words, even if the credit spread between multinational buyers and their suppliers is large, the integrated supply chain is always better off when there is no terms extension. Then, a question that naturally follows is “why do large firms associate their RF programs with payment term extension if this is not economically efficient?” To answer this question we studied published data from some firms (among which, the Unilever) to get more insights. One of our models shows that when an –otherwise, creditworthy- firm is faced with increased cost of external financing (which may have been the case for Unilever’s long-term investments in the aftermath of the 2008 liquidity crisis), then it may hold back on its investments (thus, cause underinvestment for the entire supply chain). In this case (and only), getting funds from within the supply chain by extending payment terms may be beneficial for all parties involved. To be more specific, by taking a look at the example discussed in the article, notice that the suppliers in this example tradeoff a 60-day term extension with 25% increase in turnover during a period when the market was (and has been until very recently) stagnant. Reply Damien said 09/10/16 16:03pm Spyros, Your article, in theory, sounds real good… to the MNCs, that is! As someone from supply chain, l’d like to comment here: 1. When you push Net 60 to Net 90 or Net 120, suddenly you are no longer the Tier-1 customer for your supplier! They’ll grit their teeth and keep quiet: till they score a big league customer like Unilever (or-whoever-who-cares!). The moment that happens, you can kiss that outstanding service goodbye! Heck, they’ll do you one better: They’ll actually call you up going,”Hey you need product from us? Sure thing, but here’s how we are rolling: you either pay COD or by wire or by credit card. Anything else then please lose our number!” They have bills to pay, their suppliers to pay. So while the MNC is funding other projects using THEIR money and maximizing their profitability, you seriously expect suppliers to, what, grin and bear it because a big client has graced them with their business? I don’t think so! 2. I have an alternate proposal: how about the MNCs offer these suppliers dynamic discounting? With their cash reserves they can fund the entire operation and post tangible, quantifiable cost savings and the suppliers walk away happy too! 3. If we are having any suppliers here reading this who’s got clients mandating you to use their Ariba platform to do business with them then there’s something you should know: SAP doesn’t charge these big clients for doing business on their platform; they charge the suppliers!!! What you need to do: In your invoices, add a separate line item for the service fee that SAP would charge you and bill your customer! The way I figure, since it’s their grand idea to use Ariba, why should you be paying for the back-end charges? This is slightly out of context from the centent of this article, I know but it wouldn’t hurt to mention it here. I have nothing to lose but you guys have something to gain! 😉 Reply David Atkinson said 09/07/16 05:33am The suggestion that “efficiencies captured by Unilever were passed on to suppliers in the form of higher order volumes — in effect, a win-win.” and is therefore a blueprint for others aiming to extend payment terms is laughable, or worse, risible. This is nothing more than the abuse of commercial power (or leverage) to create a ‘win’ for the buying organisation. Anyone with an ounce of experience is getting the best value out of key supplier relationships knows that extending payment terms through coercion is counter-productive, erodes trust, and promotes cheating or guile from suppliers, who load up prices to compensate. I’m afraid to say that this is the sort of c**p procurement professionals have to deal with from some close to the CFO’s office.

We are the only company in the market to offer free online downloads so users can trial the software first because we’re confident once they see how easy it is to use they’ll choose it.” CHI UK has seen significant growth in the sector as more and more industrial companies out-source the management of their occupational health responsibilities to firms such as BUPA and Capita, as well as having an enviable client list including names such as Procter and Gamble, L’Oréal, Dupont and McCain as well as many universities. The second area of expertise for CHI UK is the development of police and fire-arm management software. The specialist armoury management software was re-launched as CHIPS in 2013 and is now used by police authorities all over the UK as well as gun clubs, the National Rifle Association and in places from Abu Dhabi to Mexico. Mr Connor said: “CHIPS safeguards an entire armoury, including firearms, ammunitions, servicing records, and other assets. The software is a vital security and safe-guarding tool to records registrations, gun entitlement and licenses right down to where every bullet is and has been fired.” The software is secure as all data held in CHIPS is protected by powerful encryption and access to the system is only available to authorised users and by PIN authentication. The training element is also very important to the police who use it to record all aspects of officer training including the extensive NPFTC records as well as other police courses, authorisations, and physical and fitness tests – and even all aspects of dog training and handlers’ qualifications. “The software we produce is for very specialist markets and used to promote occupational health, safety and security,” said Wallsend-born Mr Connor, who started working in IT at a computer unit for the NHS. “CHIPS is considered to be the UK’s gold standard in police and security software and is the most popular suite of professional police and security applications in the UK. Over the years we have supplied most UK police forces as well as the British Transport Police, the Royal Air Force, the Ministry of Defence, the UK Atomic Energy Authority, and the United Nations’ HQ Police. “Orchid Desktop has become a market leader because it is simple and quick to use and allows the recording and planning of every aspect of an Occupational Health departments work. Our new system, OrchidLive.com, continues the development of our software onto the Web. “We are delighted with our new base at Hoults Yard and relocated to Newcastle as it was the location of choice for our employees. Our developers are vital to the success of our business and they all love the place and that’s very important for us.” Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Business Newsletter Follow @EveningChron Subscribe to our Business newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On Ouseburn North Tyneside Newcastle upon Tyne business all Most Read Most Recent GatesheadStation pub in Gateshead to reopen after £350,000 makeover by Hadrian Border Brewery Hadrian Border Brewery said the Victorian pub will be the first in a new chain of independent pubs PoliticsAutumn Statement RECAP: North East reaction to Philip Hammond's first budget statement Follow live updates and reaction after Chancellor Philip Hammond made his inaugural economic statement Black FridayNearly half of shoppers turned off by Black Friday, Eldon Square owner says Shopping centre intu, which also owns the Gateshead Metrocentre, surveyed 2,000 shoppers on attitudes to the discount-fest NissanNissan to sell its stake in supplier Calsonic Kansei for £3.6bn Calsonic Kansei has four plants in Sunderland and employs more than 1,400 people in the North East JesmondRecently refurbished Jesmond pub The Brandling comes up to rent The Brandling in Jesmond has been refurbished and is already attracting a lot of interest from potential publicans North East Business AwardsFledgling firms set to shine at North East Business Awards 2017 Could your firm win the Newcomer of the Year Award?

Ben Sun, an early Jet investor, writes about his optimism for the e-commerce site's sale to Walmart by Ben Sun Aug 11, 2016, 8:00am EDT tweet share Linkedin Marc Lore, CEO of e-commerce site Jet.com, which was recently acquired by Walmart. We were thrilled to wake up to Monday’s headlines announcing Walmart’s $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com — the largest U.S. e-commerce transaction to date, but a small price to pay, given Walmart’s $230 billion market cap and drive to secure a toehold against its main rival, Amazon. Jet.com is an attractive buy for Walmart — the company has made a huge dent in the online retail market in just one year’s time, and it’s a great differentiator for Walmart. It’s no surprise that Jet.com is an attractive buy for Walmart; led by Marc Lore, co-founder of Quidsi (parent of Diapers.com), the company has made a huge dent in the online retail market in just one year’s time, and it’s a great differentiator for Walmart, which has been playing catch-up to Amazon’s e-commerce domination for years. As the only New York-based seed fund in Jet’s first round (we invested alongside New Enterprise Associates, Accel, Bain Capital Ventures and MentorTech), Primary Venture Partners has long believed in the company’s strategic vision. With Lore at the helm — he’s a repeat entrepreneur looking to make huge waves in a pool he knows so well — this investment decision was one that we immediately jumped at when we were given the chance two short years ago. The balance that’s hard to beat First, a bit about the titan that Jet has been challenging. Amazon has built a successful $240 billion business by leveraging its scale to find the right balance of price, selection and convenience. Finding that right balance enables consumers to buy anything they want, whenever they want, with just the few clicks of a button, and at prices that rival any brick-and-mortar store. It has shaped the way we think, the way we shop and the way we demand, and it’s largely responsible for our dwindling patience when it comes to waiting in lines. Amazon has come closest to finding that balance with Amazon Prime, which gives users free one- or two-day shipping on most items for just $99 per year (or $10.99 per month, for the commitment-phobic). The offering makes up the majority of Amazon’s gross merchandise volume, and Prime subscribers are increasing by leaps and bounds (the Prime customer base grew from 19 million to 63 million in the last year). Moreover, subscribers making twice as many purchases and spending more than double, on average, than non-Prime customers. With market share of 42 percent of the ecommerce market, and more than 7 percent of total retail sales occurring online, there’s no one who can beat Amazon at its own game in the foreseeable future. There’s one inherent weakness to the Prime offering and its encouragement of the single-unit purchase mentality — it is extremely expensive and logistically complex for the supplier Prime is a great deal for consumers, to be sure, enabling them to make impulse purchases with nary a thought to back-end shipping costs and logistics. But there’s one inherent weakness to the Prime offering and its encouragement of the single-unit purchase mentality. With Prime, Amazon has made itself an indispensable way of life for consumers who want to log on and quickly purchase any item they need, whenever they need it — be it a few sticks of deodorant or a flat-panel TV — without any consideration for shipping costs. This way of shopping, while attractive from the consumer side, is extremely expensive and logistically complex for the supplier. Amazon has attempted to streamline fulfillment through programs like Vendor Flex, which it launched in 2013 in an attempt to ship goods faster and cheaper by co-locating an Amazon fulfillment center within a manufacturer’s warehouse. The arrangement has eliminated many overhead and shipping costs, enabling Amazon to sell diapers and other items cheaper than its competitors. Amazon building a warehouse next to where P&G stores its Pampers allows the company to sell a pack of Pampers at the lowest price. However, if a customer wants to add to that purchase a small bottle of California Baby Lotion (which is not owned by P&G), that item will be shipped from a different warehouse, which means that the additional costs of shipping ultimately fall to the customer. However, if a supplier could combine the two items into one box, it could pass those shipping savings onto the customer and offer a better price. It was this notion that Marc Lore and the Jet team went after, knowing that they couldn’t compete with Amazon for single-unit orders. Fighting back with a price-first approach In his time at Quidsi, Lore had a front-row seat as Amazon snowballed and gained more and more traction. He realized that he could never beat Amazon at its own game, but he observed the structural weakness of the single-unit purchase consumer mentality, and found his angle of attack. He launched Jet as the anti-single-unit marketplace, and its value proposition lies in incentivizing consumers to purchase multiple items at once by discounting prices. So while Amazon tinkers with finding the perfect balance between price, selection and convenience, Jet prioritizes price, in hopes of being the go-to e-commerce platform for those that value price (which are a lot of people).. Marc Lore launched Jet as the anti-single-unit marketplace, and its value proposition lies in incentivizing consumers to purchase multiple items at once by discounting prices. From his years in ecommerce, Lore understands better than most that designing a site experience and back-end fulfillment infrastructure to support multiple-unit orders is very different than the processes involved in single-unit orders. He built Jet from the ground up with the specific customer experience, marketing, technology, supply chain, fulfillment logistics and infrastructure processes to encourage and support multi-unit purchases. Lore realized that if he got this right, it’s a model that Amazon wouldn’t be able to easily (if ever) replicate with its existing infrastructure that’s so squarely focused on single-unit purchases. We’ve seen this same price versus multi-unit purchase battle between Costco and Walmart. Seemingly after a similar customer, the discount retailers are vying for market share with two vastly different business models: Walmart via sheer scale and enormous selection of goods (it carries 120,000 SKUs and boasts a $230 market cap), and Costco via a warehouse model that makes most of its revenue on annual membership fees. Costco’s membership fee offers a big advantage for customers, as it enables Costco to sell its wares at the lowest prices without having to sweat its negligible profit margins. Those low prices, in turn, encourage customers to purchase more items at once — an approach that has resulted in an average Costco order of almost $400. So despite having fewer retail stores than Walmart and only 4,000 SKUs, Costco has been able to claim a meaningful position in the market, with a $75 billion market cap to boot. The moral of the story? With a differentiated merchandising strategy and the right infrastructure in place, a meaningful portion of the consumer population can be trained to value price over selection and convenience. Jet’s strategy offers Walmart a critical toehold Jet is chipping away at Amazon’s e-commerce dominance in the same way, and its success just 12 months out of the gate has proven that the battle for the e-commerce kingdom is far from over. The company has already hit a $1 billion run-rate gross merchandise value. It’s no wonder, then, that Jet is such an attractive buy for Walmart, which has been modeling its e-commerce strategy on Amazon’s for years. That mimicry hasn’t gotten the company very far, however, with Amazon far outpacing it in every facet of the digital game. Walmart now realizes that its path to success lies in fighting back in a nontraditional way, and has chosen Jet as its key differentiator. Jet gives Walmart a smart, alternative model for competing with Amazon. Rather than struggling to find that same balance of price, convenience and selection that Amazon has nearly perfected with Prime, Jet strives to gain loyal customers by valuing price above all. Lore and his founding team of repeat entrepreneurs are playing their own game by their own rules, and in Jet they’ve built an operation that’s already claimed a meaningful share of the ecommerce market. Backed by Walmart’s supplier clout, customer reach, and balance sheet strength, we expect Team Jet to be upping their game radically in the months and years to come.

(Getty) Ryan Lochte and Michael Phelps will face off Thursday night in what could be their final showdown. With both competing in the 200-meter individual medley final, Phelps and Lochte will compete against each other one last time in the Olympics. The Rio Olympics mark the fourth games the two have competed as teammates, and rivals. Both have experienced enormous success in their swimming careers and as a result, earned millions of dollars through endorsement deals. Here’s what you need to know about Lochte’s net worth, sponsorship deals, and medal wins. 1. He Has a Net Worth Estimated at $6.2 Million Lochte ranks second all time among Olympic swimmers with 12 overall medals, including six golds. (Getty) While Olympic athletes aren’t paid for their participation in the games, top finishes in the global spotlight can lead to increased marketability and business opportunities. Although an exact figure is not known, Lochte’s net worth is estimated to be around $6.2 million, according to Money Nation. The bulk of his wealth is from lucrative endorsement deals. 2. He Has Signed Major Endorsement Deals With Companies Including Speedo & Gatorade I am #TeamSpeedo, are you? https://t.co/6FZbEcrwzT pic.twitter.com/sPlhxYTXIH — Ryan Lochte (@RyanLochte) July 27, 2016 Lochte has been able to capitalize on strong performances in Beijing, and London by signing major endorsement deals. Prior to the 2012 Olympics, Fortune Magazine estimated that Lochte earned $2.3 million from endorsement deals with brands including Speedo, Gatorade and Ralph Lauren. Throughout his swimming career, Lochte has signed major endorsement deals with companies including Gillette, Mutual of Omaha, Nissan, AT&T, and Procter and Gamble. His most lucrative deal has been with Speedo. The deal began in 2006 and has earned him an estimated half million per year since then, according to Money Nation. The website states that Gatorade and Gillette have paid Lochte figures close to $3 million each. Money Nation reports that his contracts with Nissan, AT&T and Ralph Lauren are within the range of $1.5 million to $1.8 million each. In 2013, the 32-year-old even had his own reality TV show What Would Ryan Lochte Do? on E! but it was canceled after one season. 3. He Has Earned $225,000 From Olympic Medals 4 Olympics straight we've won this relay. So humbled to be apart of this moment! #USA #oly… https://t.co/conSe3uks1 pic.twitter.com/RcNXfD0bLx — Ryan Lochte (@RyanLochte) August 10, 2016 American athletes winning medals at the Rio Olympic Games receive a cash prize from the U.S. Olympic Committee. The awards vary based on the medal won. Those awards are on top of the actual value of a “gold” medal – which is around $366 for the Rio games. The gold medal is a mixture of a small amount of 24-karat gold, some copper and a lot of sterling silver, according to Time. With six gold and three each of silver and bronze, that’s $225,000 in cash payouts. That total is based on $25,000 for each of the six Olympic gold medals Lochte has won, plus $15,000 for each of his three silvers and $10,000 for each of his three bronzes. 4. He Has Made an Estimated $1.1 Million From Swimming Competitions Since 2004 Ryan Lochte swims the breaststroke leg of a preliminary heat of the men’s 200m IM during the 2016 Arena Pro Swim Series. (Getty) Cash awards aren’t only at the Olympics– other world swimming competitions also offer athletes the opportunity to rake in some dough. For a swimmer like Lochte, who has competed in dozens of global swimming competitions, that can add up to thousands of dollars. Since 2005, Lochte has competed in World Championships every two years since 2005, where he has earned 18 gold medals, five silver and four bronze. While there are not exact figures on the cash awards for medals in those non-Olympic contests, Money Nation applied the Olympic payouts for an estimate. Those payouts in addition to his Olympic earnings add up to an estimated $1.1 million, according to the website. 5. His Parents Lost Their Home in Foreclosure Ryan Lochte and his mother attend the 2011 Golden Goggles at JW Marriott Los Angeles. (Getty) Lochte’s parents lost their home in Port Orange, Florida to foreclosure in 2013. Steven and Ileana Lochte stopped making mortgage payments several months after Steven was arrested for a DUI, according to the Daily Mail. Radar Online reported that the Lochtes were first sued in 2012 by CitiMortgage, who claimed the couple took out a loan for $258,000 in 2007, which was due at a rate of $1,609.58 per month. According to court documents obtained by RadarOnline, the couple stopped making mortgage payments in 2011 and owed more than $242,000. The Lochtes, who have five children, divorced in February 2011, after nearly 36 years of marriage.

No doubt his parents and coaches indulged him throughout his life which caused him to believe he was entitled to do whatever he wanted, whenever and wherever he wished. He is about to discover what that attitude is going to cost him…MILLIONS!

Banks Thursday, August 11, 2016 Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Print SMS More Reddit Google Stumbleupon For media inquries, contact: Media Inquiries 202.797.6103 The past few years have brought good news for wind and solar electricity generation, especially in terms of declining costs and deployment of more and more capacity, but skepticism remains about renewable energy, perhaps driven by insufficient awareness of what’s actually happening in electricity markets. Author John P. Banks Nonresident Senior Fellow - Foreign Policy, Energy Security and Climate Initiative There is no question that deploying higher percentages of wind and solar generation poses challenges for the electricity system. But addressing these challenges is feasible: solutions are being implemented to accommodate clean renewable electricity at a reasonable cost and without threatening the stability of the grid. Many groups have been documenting this experience, such as the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the International Energy Agency, the Regulatory Assistance Project, America’s Power Plan, and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory among others. But perhaps more importantly, customers–from households to large corporations–are demanding cleaner sources of energy, and system operators and many electric utilities are meeting this demand. Giving customers what they want: Corporate America and the electricity industry embrace renewables System operators are integrating higher percentages of renewable electricity generation, with several organized markets across the United States experiencing record levels of wind energy production. In February of this year, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) achieved 45 percent wind penetration on its grid, and the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) reached a record 13,084 megawatts (MW) from wind. In one recent survey of utility executives, nearly 70 percent identified utility scale renewables as the technology in which they are most invested, and in 2014, renewable energy accounted for at least 20 percent of total retail electricity sales for four major utilities: Xcel Energy, Pacific Gas & Electric, Sempra Energy, and Edison International. The Edison Electric Institute (EEI), representing the nation’s investor-owned utilities, emphasizes clean energy as one of the industry’s three strategic initiatives (the others being grid modernization and customer engagement).

In April 2014, Citigroup declared that the “age of renewables is beginning,” and Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and others have all announced multi-year, multi-billion dollar investments in clean energy technology. One of the more interesting trends emerging in the past several years is large corporations demanding renewable energy to power their businesses. In 2015, corporate customers such as Google, General Motors, Philips, Dow, Apple, Facebook, Owens Corning, Kaiser Permanente, and Procter & Gamble purchased 3.2 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy. “Utility scale solar can really address the needs of the Clean Power Plan and other objectives we have.” – Nick Akins, CEO, AEP A recent report stated that nearly half of Fortune 500 companies, and 60 percent of Fortune 100 companies have “aggressive” clean energy goals. Recently, EEI joined World Resources Institute and the World Wildlife Fund to create a partnership– the Utility-Corporate Buyer Collaborative Forum–to further facilitate how utilities can meet corporate demand for renewable energy. Utilities such as Duke, Dominion, NV Energy, PSEG and others are beginning to respond specifically to this demand, developing shared solar, green tariff, and utility services and procurement products. “If you want to play in the future, you’ve got to be part of the solar industry.” – Ken Zagzebski, President, AES Implementing solutions to support high levels of renewable electricity Skepticism of renewables revolves around a view that wind and solar are too expensive and too variable, pose technical integration problems, threaten the reliability of the grid, and that addressing these concerns is costly. As noted, this perspective is based in part on how wind and solar are different than convention fuels–especially in how they interact with the grid–but it is also plainly true that solutions do exist to accommodate these resources on the grid and in electricity markets because it is clearly happening today. Capital costs and policy support There is a general perception that renewables are too expensive–driven by high up-front capital costs–and require subsidies and other policy support that raise prices for consumers. While some renewable technologies remain expensive, such as offshore wind or concentrated solar thermal, the costs of onshore wind and solar PV technology have declined dramatically in recent years, making these renewable technologies increasingly competitive. Lazard’s most recent assessment of the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for various generation technologies indicates that onshore wind and utility scale solar PV–unsubsidized–are cost competitive with natural gas combined cycle and coal-fired power plants and cheaper to build than nuclear generation. Recent data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) also indicates that in some regions in the United States, wind PPA prices are below on-peak wholesale prices: In 2015, average wind PPA prices were $19-35/MWh in Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and Nebraska (although higher in New England). Wind PPAs in Texas–unsubsidized–are at an LCOE of around $50/MWh. In a nutshell, these prices are very competitive. At its annual summit in April, Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimated that globally wind costs have fallen 50 percent since 2009, and solar PV module costs have fallen 80 percent since 2008. Have policy supports for renewables increased prices for consumers? The most recent assessment by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) of renewable portfolio standards (RPS) implemented by 29 states and the District of Columbia reveals that RPS compliance costs were only 1.3 percent of average household bills in 2014. Some also assert that direct policy support for renewables, especially subsidies such as the federal production tax credit (PTC) for wind of 2.3 cents per kWh, represents a market-distortion. This type of criticism overlooks the fact that there are all sorts of non-market transactions, or interventions, in energy markets for specific technologies, not to mention market failures that policy tries to correct. Indeed, the PTC may be a subsidy, but you could argue that it represents about the added cost to account for carbon externalities if applied to the electricity produced by a coal-fired plant that the wind generator displaces. And right now, that coal plant is effectively getting a subsidy by allowing it to emit carbon into the atmosphere.

By Frances Seymour and Jonah Busch 2016 C Upcoming Challenges in the Process of China’s Urbanization Edited by Karen Eggleston, Jean C. Oi, and Yiming Wang 2016 A more relevant, constructive and certainly legitimate critique is to re-assess the most efficient policy approaches in light of de-carbonization goals, the level of a technology’s commercialization, and other factors. The current debate over whether and how to address the declining competitiveness of some nuclear power plants reflects this broader issue, and the New York Public Service Commission’s recent recommendation that several nuclear plants receive a credit based on the social cost of carbon indicates one specific approach as part of this discussion. Variability and intermittency It is often claimed that variable renewable energy (RE) resources are unreliable: The wind doesn’t always blow and sun doesn’t always shine (variability), and the weather is difficult to forecast with enough accuracy to ensure reliability of the system (intermittency). This is perhaps the most common critical refrain concerning renewable electricity generation. What is actually happening in markets illustrates that variability and intermittency are manageable and much less of a problem than imagined. System operators can’t control RE generators, but rather accommodate them through a suite of tools and approaches that provide system flexibility. In short, flexibility is the new paradigm for electricity systems, and this flexibility is being achieved in a variety of ways: Fast markets: The cheapest approaches involve adapting market rules to accommodate renewables. Simply stated, these tools, such as sub-hourly scheduling and dispatch, allow markets to adapt more rapidly and closer to real time to changing wind and solar conditions. For example, ERCOT and MISO have five minute, real-time energy markets. These “faster” markets are more efficient and reliable, and reduce reserves needed to balance the system. Expanded grid operating areas: Larger operating areas allow grid operators to access a wider array of resources, thus mitigating variability, ensuring reliability, and lowering costs. For example, the Western Energy Imbalance Market (EIM) was launched on November 1, 2014, with the goal to connect disparate balancing authorities across California, Oregon, Nevada, Washington, Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming. In fact, one of the reasons this occurred is because of the recognition that having a larger grid operating area is essential as the amount of renewable energy resources continues to grow. The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) just released its quarterly assessment of the EIM, quantifying benefits of $64.6 million since its inception. These benefits are related to more efficient dispatch, reduced renewable energy curtailment, and reduced flexibility reserves needed. Improved forecasting: Wind forecasting capabilities have greatly improved in recent years helping to address intermittency. Experience reveals that wind is far more predictable than previously thought within typical dispatch times, and that most of the major ISO markets in the United States are dispatching wind based on wind levels 10 minutes before real time “with an accuracy comparable to that of load and conventional generators.” Xcel Energy has been working with the National Center for Atmospheric Research since 2009 to develop state of the art weather forecasting models. Xcel estimates that by 2014 these models saved the utility’s customers $40 million largely in “fuel savings due to more efficient system dispatch.” Flexible demand: Another way to provide flexibility to accommodate RE is implementing approaches that allow demand to be managed. Demand response (DR) programs can participate in capacity and ancillary service markets, and help load balancing during large supply losses. For example, more than 10,000 MW of DR resources were procured in the most recent PJM capacity market auction for the 2019/2020 delivery year. Flexible generation: Increasing the amount of variable renewable electricity generation requires the existing conventional fleet of dispatchable generators to cycle more, i.e., ramp up and ramp down, to accommodate RE. While nuclear, coal, and some (non-peaking) natural gas units have not typically been designed to cycle in this manner, raising concerns over increasing wear and tear and added maintenance costs, there are approaches to increase the flexibility of conventional generators. NREL worked with a coal-fired facility in the U.S. demonstrating the ability to load follow, run at minimum generation levels, and start-up and shut-down in the same day, accomplished with a variety of operational changes. Xcel Energy in Colorado has implemented similar changes for its natural gas plants, and nuclear plants in some circumstances are also capable of flexible operation: Jim Conca recently wrote about Germany’s 1,400 MW Grohnde reactor that, although typically used as baseload, is now running 600 hours per month to regulate load. Finally, while using conventional generators as flexible resources does add cost, evidence to date suggests that these costs are far outweighed by the savings in fuel costs as coal and natural gas fired units run fewer hours. NREL estimated that with up to 33 percent penetration of wind and solar in the western U.S. grid, cycling costs would increase $35 to $157 million annually (or $0.47 to $1.28/MWh), but would save $7 billion in annual fuel costs. Storage: Storage provides flexibility through load shifting (using excess renewable production for later peak periods), balancing (reducing net load ramps), and participating in ancillary services markets (addressing frequency and regulation needs). Skeptics of the role that renewables can play, and the amount that can be deployed, often base their view on two assertions: that RE needs storage to work, and that storage is too costly and will remain so for the foreseeable future. First, storage is but one tool to provide flexibility, as shown above, and second, while cost is still a challenge for storage, there is strong evidence that costs are coming down, deployment is increasing, and there is more and more policy and regulatory support emerging to promote storage.The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports that non-hydro storage capacity in the United States doubled in the period 2010-2015, and BNEF’s New Energy Outlook 2016 projects battery costs to decline 60 percent by 2030. Greentech Media’s most recent storage market assessment reports that 20 states and four regional markets have storage policies. Programs and policies are also emerging at the federal level exemplified by a recently announced White House initiative to promote storage, and the Senate’s draft energy legislation (S. 2012) proposing $50 million annually from FY2017 to FY2026 for DOE to carry out storage R&D (although it remains to be seen if this legislation will move forward). In a recent survey of U.S. utility executives, 65 percent ranked energy storage as the technology in which they should invest more. Utilities are actively responding to these trends. In late 2014, Southern California Edison awarded contracts for 260 MW of storage as part of a procurement to replace the retirement of the San Onofre nuclear station and several large natural gas generation units, and Oncor, the largest transmission and distribution company in Texas, announced plans to invest over $5 billion in storage. Integration costs Many critiques of renewables not only highlight their high up-front capital costs, but also the cost of integrating them, which many warn are not factored into overall costs. The IEA neatly summarizes three categories of integration costs: network (transmission interconnection); balancing (increased need for ancillary services); and capacity adequacy (backup generation capacity). Experience thus far, however, indicates that RE integration costs are modest and manageable. NREL’s assessment of a number of studies concludes that integration costs are between $5 to $12/MWh (and frequently below $5/MWh) for wind capacity levels up to 40 percent of peak load. Moreover, it’s worth highlighting two facts about electricity system operation, as articulated by NREL: Greater penetration of RE does require more flexibility, i.e., more responsive conventional generation and responsive load, but does not increase overall capacity requirements; and second, all generators impose costs when added to a power system, but they are “seldom calculated as integration costs and never applied to conventional generators as integration costs.” Technical integration RE resources pose technical integration challenges: Since they are not synchronous generation–there is no direct electro-mechanical link to the grid–they are incapable of providing some typical ancillary services, such as stabilizing inertia (helping maintain frequency) and reactive power (helping maintain voltage levels). Nevertheless, approaches are being implemented to make ancillary service markets and the renewable energy generators themselves more flexible. ERCOT is working on developing a new ancillary service to better address frequency response (its Fast Frequency Response product), and CAISO is proposing a Flexible Ramping Product to secure up-ramping and down-ramping resources in both the day-ahead and real-time markets. Markets and utilities also are increasingly allowing or requiring RE to participate in ancillary service markets. While there are differences in implementation rules across system operators, PJM, MISO, ERCOT, NYISO, and ISO-NE allow wind to participate in ancillary service markets, providing such services as frequency response and voltage regulation. Capacity factor and baseload capacity Another critique of RE is that variability means they run fewer hours and produce less of their rated capacity compared to conventional, dispatchable resources, and are unable to provide baseload capacity. The reality is that capacity factors for renewables have been improving dramatically. BNEF estimates an average capacity factor for onshore wind in the United States of 37 percent for the second half of 2015, with capacity factors in Texas over 50 percent. LBNL research reports an average capacity factor of 27 percent for utility-scale solar (including both PV and CSP projects), with some individual installations reaching 35 percent. Meanwhile, the U.S. EIA estimates that the average capacity factors in 2015 for gas combined cycle plants and coal steam plants were both around 55 percent (for nuclear, capacity factor is around 90 percent). “The idea of baseload power is already outdated.” – Steve Holliday, CEO of National Grid Baseload is an economic concept in transition. For over a century the power sector has been structured around using controllable generation technologies to meet variable demand. However, the fundamental challenge going forward is to think about electricity systems differently: As more and more variable generation is deployed, the new paradigm for electricity markets is flexibility. As experts at America’s Power Plan aptly state: “In previous decades, grid operators looked at demand as an independent variable, and dispatched supply to meet it. Now, supply is more variable and demand is more controllable.” This reality is reflected more and more in the views of utilities. Steve Holliday, the CEO of National Grid summarized: “An extraordinary amount of capital was tied up for an unusual set of circumstances: to ensure supply at any moment. This is now turned on its head. The future will be much more driven by availability of supply: by demand side response and management which will enable the market to balance price of supply and of demand. It’s how we balance these things that will determine the future shape of our business.” Transmission Renewable energy resources are often located far from demand, requiring expensive and difficult to site transmission infrastructure. There is no question that building new transmission is difficult: It often takes up to 10 years in the United States and other locations, owing to regulatory review, permitting and siting requirements, property and eminent domain disputes, and not-in-my-backyard sentiment across multiple jurisdictions. Nevertheless, there are recent examples of successful approaches to addressing the transmission challenge, including innovative planning and cost allocation methodologies. The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool credited the Highway-Byway Cost Allocation process with allowing that market to deliver higher levels of wind generation. In 2008, the Texas Public Utilities Commission authorized the creation of five “competitive renewable energy zones” (CREZ), designating wind rich areas in the western part of the state and authorizing transmission expansion and new construction to bring the electricity to demand centers in the east. A recent report from the University of Minnesota documented how 11 utilities across Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and South Dakota collaborated and worked with local stakeholders to “plan, develop, and build $2.1 billion worth of new high-voltage transmission lines spanning nearly 800 miles.” Competitive Renewable Energy Zones in Texas are credited with facilitating the addition of 3,500 miles of transmission lines and reducing curtailments of wind generation from 17 percent of total wind production in 2009 to 0.5 percent in 2014. While estimates of transmission-related costs to accommodate higher levels of renewable energy penetration vary, they are generally a small percentage of total costs. For example, NREL examined a variety of scenarios of wind penetration by 2024 in the Eastern Interconnect of the United States and found incremental transmission costs to be less than 10 percent of total system costs up to 30 percent wind penetration. Large-scale renewables are a growing part of the generation mix Adding a significant amount of renewable energy does indeed challenge the way electricity systems have been structured and operated for over a century. But cost-effective solutions exist, and high levels of renewable energy in the electricity mix are possible, presenting more of an economic challenge than technical one. NREL’s assessment of numerous grid integration studies concludes that deployment of RE of “at least 30 percent is achieved by implementing largely well-understood changes to system operations along with transmission capacity expansion,” and its Renewable Electricity Futures Study showed relatively small rate increases over next 40 years with 80 percent renewable energy in 2050. And it’s not just a variety of studies championing RE: electric companies and system operators are integrating more and more of these resources each year. In fact, electric utility companies are responsible for virtually all of the wind energy in the United States and about 60 percent of the solar energy deployed is owned by electric utilities. Thus, it is no longer a question of whether deploying and integrating large-scale renewables is possible. Rather, the key questions going forward are: working out the most effective and efficient policies to incentivize as many low carbon resources as possible, and; integrating distributed energy resources–specifically, “understanding the complete value chain for all parties…and getting the pricing right.” Renewables are not the only answer to the energy-climate challenge, but we need every low carbon MWh available, and skeptics should at least recognize what corporate America, Wall Street, system operators, a growing number of utilities, and more and more households already do–that innovations in policy, technology, and market operations are taking place in real-time allowing the integration of higher levels of clean renewable energy while maintaining reliability and affordability.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Rio Olympics: The three rings of change Kiran Khalap   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Rio marks several species of change for the marketing community, testing their creativity all over again It isn’t the most expensive. Apparently, its $11-billion operating budget is lower than the Athens Olympics budget ($15 billion) of 2004! It isn’t the most watched Olympics on TV either. Fewer viewers watched the opening ceremony than during London. And only 82 per cent of the tickets have been sold, even at half the price of London. But it has many firsts: It’s the first in a South American city. First in a Portuguese-speaking country. Motto: Um mundo novo (A new world). First to host a Refugee Olympic Team (country code: ROT). And yet. The Olympics have never been just about sports and a spectacle, they are a statement of power. In sheer numbers, the India-Pakistan 2015 World Cup match had the highest number of viewers of any sport. One billion! So it’s not about just viewership. They are a statement of power on a global stage. With 207 participants – for the individuals who participate and wish to make a statement (think Jesse Owens), for the country that hosts (fact: Between 1950 and 2005, Olympic host cities were in countries with an average real GDP per capita of $9,546) and the brands that use it as a marketing event. Samsung pulled away from its Korean roots and took its rightful place at the global brand table by sponsoring the Olympic Games in 1988. P&G went from being a concealed ‘House of Brands’ to a warm, loveable “Proud Sponsor of Moms” at the Olympics of 2012, adding over $500 million in product sales in the bargain. It will continue to build on this association till 2020. Its Rio campaign (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ3k6BFX2uw) celebrates how mothers shape achievers. GE has pursued its agenda of turning green by pursuing sustainability with the IOC since 2005. And yet. Rio 2016 will mark several species of change for the marketing community, changes that will test their creativity all over again. Change One: Rule 40 The new IOC rule has had athletes and brands up in arms. Non-sponsors can’t use words such as “Olympics,” “Summer Games,” or even generic words such as “games,” “gold,” or “Rio”. And athletes can tweet about their sponsors, but without using those words. This means marketers must find new ways of bypassing the rule. See the breathtaking, almost poetic ad for Under Armour with Michael Phelps (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh9jAD1ofm4). No mention of Olympics, but it’s very clearly about Olympics! Obviously, the IOC has created the rule to protect the interests of the five big sponsors who dole out $200 million each … but there is research to show that viewers also associate high-profile brands as sponsors of the Olympics. Change Two: Many screens Because of the time zone of South America, most viewing will be time-adjusted around the world (YouTube’s Olympic Channel will start August 21). Olympic Broadcasting Services, host broadcaster, has itself stated that for the first time in Olympic history, its digital-oriented footage will outnumber the amount of television-oriented footage. The marketer has to make sure his brand messaging has the ability to hold its own across many screens. And what holds attention on any screen size? Stories. Authentic stories. Marketers are using the authenticity of the stories of the athletes they sponsor to bypass the cynicism of the viewers. Phelps’ son has his own Instagram account (https://www.instagram.com/boomerrphelps/?hl=en) which translates like this in communication parlance: “I adore Boomer + I respect Phelps = I most likely will like brand (Under Armour) he is sponsored by.” Usain Bolt has an animation film from Gatorade, a feature film trailer out on Twitter and an Instagram logic of Usain = Champion = Champion Razors. Nike uses Serena Williams and our very own Dipa Karmakar is on WSJ Videos, explaining how she had a flat foot and was told she would never be good at gymnastics. Change Three: Live & 360 degree So, while on the one hand conditions will encourage deferred viewing, it will also be the most live broadcast Olympic ever: 85 hours in 360-degree virtual reality formats by the Olympic Broadcasting Services, plus Twitter with its Periscope and Vine. Here is Sania Mirza launching the Indian flag emoji on Twitter (https://twitter.com/mirzasania/status/760462829224878080)…there are 207 emojis, one for each nation! So how does the marketer sustain interest when everything is live? Where does the message sneak in? Google is doing it by bypassing the Olympics altogether. It is focusing instead on the venue, but enriching it with 360 degree views (https://www.google.com/cultural institute/beta/u/0/project/rio-de- janeiro). And one last thing, as Steve Jobs used to say. The Russian track and field and weightlifting teams were banned from the Rio 2016 Games for doping. Their absence makes a substantial difference. After all, in London 2012 the team took home a total of 82 medals. Cheating at the Olympics grows cleverer and cleverer. One opinion is that cheaters are five to ten years ahead of detectors. But rather than get into a competition between cheaters and catchers outside the arena, what if we conducted a thought-experiment where everything was allowed inside the arena? Who would win? What else would they use (Exo-skeletons? Bionic limbs? CRISPR-Cas9)? What tricks would marketers encourage their athletes to use? It’s an interesting question and I urge you to read all about it here: http://www.diamandis.com/ blog/unlimited-olympics-would-you- watch-it (This article was published on August 11, 2016) Related TOPICS sport | Get more of your favourite news delivered to your inbox SEND MY NEWS Please enter your email.

New Generation Latino Media, created by Leguizamo and David Chitel in 2013, works with Procter and Gamble, Ford Motor, and Amtrak, using digital video. The content firm “creates and distributes sponsored content across Latino-oriented sites using proprietary technology that serves videos in ads.” READ: John Leguizamo Says “We’ve Gotta Do Everything To Help Our Black Brothers And Sisters” NGL has already produced 20 videos for Orgullosa, in which Afro-Latinx actresses Gina Rodriguez and Dascha Polanco explain their journey into acting, with Rodriguez speaking to a group of young actresses of color, and Polanco shedding light on her Dominican upbringing in New York. The digital videos touch on a generation of Latinx kids who are growing up with new forms of media—seeing positive reflections of various aspects of themselves and various aspects of their identity is critical. Until recently, Latinx portrayals have had negative effects on the community, but digital media videos might be able to change the narrative.

By Shira Ovide. Added by Agency Staff on 11 August 2016. Saved under Top, World Tags: Facebook, Google, Mark Zuckerberg Tweet Mark Zuckerberg Facebook collects less than the 5% of the US$500bn spent on advertising each year. To achieve the deepest, darkest dreams of Mark Zuckerberg, the company must become the first one that dominates both the kind of precision ads that built Google and the emotional ads that made TV the world’s dominant marketing force. Facebook has so far cracked the first half of that equation, following in the footsteps of Google by locking down what’s called “direct response” advertising. If I own a store in Brooklyn that sells running shoes, I naturally want to find people who are in the market for what I’m selling. If someone types “running shoes Brooklyn” into Google, the company has a pretty good clue that is a person I want. My store can pay to show a link to my website to this probable Brooklyn runner. Largely because Google became an efficient way for many businesses to find people who are looking for exactly what the businesses are selling, direct response ads make up the majority of online advertising. Facebook is pretty good at this type of advertising, too, again because we tell Facebook who we are and what we like. But dominating direct response ads with Google isn’t enough for Facebook. About $200bn is spent each year on TV commercials, mostly on direct response’s handsome brother, branded advertising. Brand ads are those TV commercials of a smiling couple driving an Audi through a snowy mountain range. The next time we go car shopping, Audi wants us to have this innate feeling that its vehicles will make us happy and beautiful. Away from the Internet, brand ads make up a majority of advertising. And they’re lucrative. The average cost to reach a thousand people with a prime-time TV ad was $50 in 2015, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis. The comparable ad price on Facebook was $5. Facebook wants these pricey brand ads desperately. Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg is fond of saying that for advertisers and their $500bn budgets, the social network is like the Super Bowl every night. She’s wrong. Facebook is way bigger than the Super Bowl. More than 1,1bn people use Facebook daily. About 110m people watch the Super Bowl telecast. Sandberg’s pitch is about convincing advertisers to think of Facebook as a place that is even bigger than TV’s biggest stage but with the stockpile of personal information to target ads only to people who are most likely to buy an Audi. In Facebook’s view, it is the best of Google’s bloodlessly efficient direct response advertising with the mass reach and charm of TV commercials. It sounds beautiful, but it turns out it can be hard to be both Google and television. The world’s biggest advertiser, Procter & Gamble, told the Wall Street Journal that it found targeting niches like teenage shavers on Facebook generated too narrow an audience for P&G brands that need to sells millions of bottles of Tide and Gillette razors. This seems, I don’t know, blindingly obvious? P&G said it won’t spend less money on Facebook, but it and some other big advertisers seem to be falling back in love with TV. The top 100 marketers spent 1% more on TV ads in the first quarter of this year compared with the amount in the period a year earlier, according to a Morgan Stanley analysis published in May. That was a lift from a 2% decline in their combined TV ad spending last year. P&G was among a handful of top brand advertisers — also including GM, Pepsi and Verizon — that sharply increased their TV ad spending this year after pulling back in 2015. “Investors should feel better about TV’s place in ad budgets today than they did a year ago,” Morgan Stanley wrote. What’s good for TV is probably not good for Facebook’s ambitions in brand advertising. Still, the winds are at Facebook’s back. Younger people in particular are spending more free time on their phones, including on Facebook, and less on TV. Facebook is expanding the pool of potential advertisers to small businesses that never advertised beyond the Yellow Pages. Facebook’s commitment to online video — which looks a lot like TV — helps it lure brand ads, too. It won’t be easy for Facebook, but the company knows it won’t crack the next 95% of that advertising spending unless it figures out how to become the perfect advertising medium for companies hunting for the best blend of TV and the Web.  — (c) 2016 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 9Why SA Connect tender was cancelled 9Vodacom to launch VOD platform 7A radical proposal for state-owned fibre 5MTN’s Mteto Nyati takes the fight to No 1 5One day I will tell you the truth – Zuma Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

Today, even though the political scene appears fractured, and worldwide terror seems to be on the rise, the markets hit all-time highs. The question for investors is what to do now. The answer is buy some of the top dividend stocks, put them in your account and hold them forever. We screened the Merrill Lynch research universe for stock on the dividend aristocrats lists that were also rated Buy. The dividend aristocrats are members of the S&P 500 and have increased their dividends for at least 20 consecutive years. We found four that investors can buy now and hold forever. AT&T This company has had an incredible run this year, and the Merrill Lynch team sees it going even higher. AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) is the world’s largest provider of pay TV, with TV customers in the United States and 11 Latin American countries. In the United States, the AT&T wireless network has the nation’s self-described strongest 4G LTE signal and most reliable 4G LTE. The company also helps businesses worldwide serve their customers better with mobility and highly secure cloud solutions. With its shares trading at a very cheap 14.3 times estimated 2016 earnings, the company continues to expand its user base, and strong product introductions from smartphone vendors have not only driven traffic but increased device financing plans. The company reported inline numbers for the second quarter, and while the consolidated revenue number was slightly higher than the Merrill Lynch estimate, the EBITDA was slightly below. Company management noted it is on track to meet or exceed current estimates for the year. Many Wall Street analysts have cited the company’s positive commentary on free cash flow, in addition to improving video/broadband trends later this year, with single truck-roll and new converged offerings expected to be coming in October. AT&T investors are paid a huge 4.42% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price target for the stock is $46, and the Wall Street consensus target is $42.84. The stock closed Thursday at $43.39 per share. Coca-Cola This company remains a top Warren Buffet holding and offers not only safety, but an incredible strong worldwide brand. Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) is the world’s largest beverage company, refreshing consumers with more than 500 sparkling and still brands. Led by Coca-Cola, its portfolio features 20 billion-dollar brands, including Diet Coke, Fanta, Sprite, Coca-Cola Zero, vitaminwater, Powerade and Minute Maid. Globally, it is the top provider of sparkling beverages, ready-to-drink coffees and juices and juice drinks. Through the world’s largest beverage distribution system, consumers in more than 200 countries enjoy its beverages at a rate of more than 1.9 billion servings a day. Despite reporting second-quarter earnings that came in above some estimates, slower growth and flat volumes brought out the sellers and they tagged the stock big time. It is important to remember though that the company own 31.5% of Monster Beverage, which continues to deliver big numbers. Coca-Cola investors receive an outstanding 3.2% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price target is set at $52, while the consensus price target figure is $47.76. The stock closed Thursday at $43.75. 3M This top industrial could really jump with an economic pickup. 3M Co. (NYSE: MMM) is a diversified, global manufacturer. Its businesses are technology-driven and organized under five segments: Consumer, Safety and Graphics, Electronics and Energy, Healthcare, and Industrial. Its popular brands include Scotch, Post-It, 3M and Thinsulate. The company also holds over 500 U.S. patents. 3M posted outstanding second-quarter results, and the company adjusted the midpoint of its guidance, the analysts remain positive but note the company, like many, faces a tough global macro environment. They do think the results are strong in relation to peers and feel that the focus toward return on invested capital will yield multiple expansion and earnings growth. 3M investors are paid a decent 2.45% dividend. Merrill Lynch has a $200 price target for the stock, and the Wall Street consensus price objective is $179.43. Shares closed most recently at $181. Procter & Gamble This stock is trading at almost the same level it was this time last year, in part because it has a very large 65% of sales directed to foreign customers, which should improve as the dollar’s run has slowed dramatically. Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) is a solid consumer staples stock for conservative investors to consider. The company sells lots of very well-known household items that are essential for everyday life, and it operates through five segments: Beauty, Hair and Personal Care; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby, Feminine and Family Care. The company posted solid earnings last quarter, and many on Wall Street feel that the new focus on a slimmed down product portfolio will help spur earnings growth and return the company to its long-time premium consumer staples multiple. Some analyst estimates for the next two years are 2% above current Wall Street expectations. Shareholders are paid a solid 3.1% dividend. Merrill Lynch has a $95 price target, and the posted consensus estimate is a touch lower at $90.56. The stock closed Thursday at $86.73 a share. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   Nothing real exciting here, just companies that have been around forever, and regardless of politics, macro changes and headlines, they will be around for the foreseeable future. These stocks are perfect fits for conservative growth and income portfolios.

It’s one of the most universal recommendations in all of public health: Floss daily to prevent gum disease and cavities. A recent AP report cited little proof that flossing works. When the federal government issued its 2016 dietary guidelines, the flossing recommendation had been removed, without notice. SHAVAUGHN MOSS Guardian Lifestyles Editor shavaughn@nasguard.com Published: Aug 09, 2016 Share This: Rate this article: Add To favourite “Medical benefits of dental floss unproven” — it was a headline that caught many people’s attention last week — after all, one of the most universal recommendations in public health is to floss daily to prevent gum disease and cavities. A report by the Associated Press (AP) cited little proof that flossing works despite the fact that the United States federal government, dental organizations and manufacturers of floss have pushed the practice for decades; and the American Dental Association (ADA) insists that “flossing is an essential part of taking care of teeth and gums”. The AP requested evidence on the U.S. government’s findings on flossing from the United States (U.S.) Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture, and followed up with written requests under the Freedom of Information Act. When the federal government issued its latest dietary guidelines this year, the flossing recommendation had been removed, without notice. In a letter to the AP, the government acknowledged the effectiveness of flossing had never been researched, as required. The AP report said it looked at the most rigorous research conducted over the past decade, focusing on 25 studies that generally compared the use of a toothbrush with the combination of toothbrushes and floss. The findings? The evidence for flossing was “weak, very unreliable,” of “very low” quality, and carries “a moderate to large potential for bias.” And that the majority of available studies fail to demonstrate that flossing is generally effective in plaque removal, according to one review conducted last year. Another 2015 review cited “inconsistent/weak evidence” for flossing and a "lack of efficacy.” The AP report said one study review in 2011 did credit floss with a slight reduction in gum inflammation — which can sometimes develop over time into full-fledged gum disease. However, the reviewers ranked the evidence as “very unreliable”. And that commentary in a dental magazine stated that any benefit would be so minute it might not be noticed by users. Local periodontist Dr. Antoine Clarke encourages flossing as one part of a regular hygiene routine that also includes brushing teeth at least twice a day and flossing at least once a day, as the main purpose of flossing is to decrease plaque (bacteria). “The long-term benefit number one is it [flossing] decreases plaque that builds up around teeth. Plaque induces inflammation that leads to gingival inflammation, swelling and can also cause tooth decay,” said Dr. Clarke who practices out of Rose North House on Collins Avenue “I’ve been practicing for over 20 years and I’ve seen the benefits with [people who floss] and those that don’t — those that come in with regular oral hygiene habits — that use toothbrushes, interdental cleaners and go for regular checkups, and those that don’t, so it [report] really didn’t bother me much,” he said. “Patients need to always floss at least a minimum of once a day. There is always a tight spot or spots in every individual that need urgent care, and if we leave food particles, plaque, between the teeth or around the gum, you develop either dental caries [cavities], or periodontal disease. It minimizes those two diseases right there.” The U.S. federal government has recommended flossing since 1979, first in a surgeon general’s report and later in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans issued every five years. According to the AP report, two leading professional groups — the American Dental Association and the American Academy of Periodontology (AAP), for specialists in gum disease and implants — cited other studies as proof of their claims that flossing prevents buildup of gunk known as plaque, early gum inflammation called gingivitis and tooth decay. But, the AP said, most of these studies used outdated methods or tested few people. The report said some lasted only two weeks – far too brief for a cavity or dental disease to develop. And that one tested 25 people after only a single use of floss. Such research, like the reviewed studies, focused on warning signs like bleeding and inflammation, barely dealing with gum disease or cavities. The AP report also said Wayne Aldredge, president of the periodontists’ group, acknowledged the weak scientific evidence and the brief duration of many studies. In an interview at his private practice in New Jersey, he said that the impact of floss might be clearer if researchers focused on patients at the highest risk of gum disease, such as diabetics and smokers. He still urges his patients to floss to help avoid gum disease. “It’s like building a house and not painting two sides of it,” said Aldredge. “Ultimately those two sides are going to rot away quicker.” When the story made headlines, Dr. Clarke said patients flooded his office with questions and to find out his position. He is a flossing advocate. “The main purpose of flossing is to remove plaque [bacteria]. Some individuals don’t have the manual dexterity to get between the teeth. Some individuals over the years may have had numerous restorations — amalgams, filling, composites, crowns, veneers, bridges — all these things floss needs to be able to clean. In the absence of floss, those individuals would develop dental decay, which is on the rise. Also what we consider recurrent decay, which is also at a higher increase.” The periodontist said periodontal disease is influenced and takes place over a period of time, and also influenced by multiple factors. He said the AAP recommends that studies need to be more detailed as relates to the efficacy of daily flossing. He also said many people floss incorrectly, moving it in a sawing motion instead of up and down the sides of the teeth. According to Dr. Clarke, the wrong way to floss is tying the floss between your fingers and not having control. He said the other wrong way to floss entails using it like a saw between the teeth. The right way, he said, is to roll off at least 10 inches of floss, wrap it around the two index fingers so that you can control it, wrap the floss around the tooth and proceed in an up and down motion. Dr. Clarke said in the absence of quality research, patients should continue to include flossing as part of their daily oral hygiene habits. “Flossing from the early 60s has been one of the main adjuncts in keeping bacteria and oral diseases under control, and is probably one of the least expensive mains in maintenance therapy — $3 for a box of floss or $600 to $2,000 for a yearly visit to the dentist,” said Dr. Clarke. Aldredge, pressed by the AP about the origins of his organization’s endorsement of flossing, said it may simply have “taken the ADA’s lead”. When the ADA was asked for proof of its claim that flossing helps prevent early gum disease and cavities by the AP, the group cited the 2011 review and a 2008 two-week study that measured bacteria and did not even consider gum disease. In a later statement to the AP the ADA said flossing “removes plaque” and “is proven to help remove” debris from between teeth. A video on its website proclaims that flossing “helps prevent gum disease”. When pressed, Matthew J. Messina, a practicing dentist and spokesman for the dental association, acknowledged weak evidence, but he blamed research participants who didn't floss correctly. The AAP also recommends flossing as one part of a regular hygiene routine that also includes brushing your teeth at least twice a day, and flossing at least once a day. The AAP in association with the ADA, recommends that patients need to floss in conjunction with other home care products. “Regular dental oral hygiene and care is based on a number of things — not just flossing,” said Dr. Clarke. “Flossing alone does not show any strong scientific evidence to prevent any of those things. Basically that study was geared towards people only flossing and not brushing. But a part of the study that was missing was they didn’t compare individuals that used a toothbrush regularly, and also those individuals that use toothbrushing as well as flossing. Flossing is one of a few dental cleaners that helps in dental hygiene,” he said. “The AAP shows that the interdental cleaners is an essential part of periodontal care and maintenance, and that includes floss, small brushes, special wooden or plastic picks, sticks or water flossers — all of these are adjuncts to help.” According to the AP report, even companies with a big market share of the flossing business which next year is predicted to reach almost $2 billion, struggled to provide convincing evidence of their claims that floss reduces plaque or gingivitis, and that the industry had paid for most studies and sometimes designed and conducted the research. The report said Procter & Gamble, which claims that its floss fights plaque and gingivitis, pointed to a two-week study, which was discounted as irrelevant in the 2011 research review. And that Johnson & Johnson spokesman Marc Boston said floss helps remove plaque and that when the AP sent him a list of contradicting studies, he declined comment. The floss-making companies partner with the ADA through its Seal of Acceptance program. The ADA promotes the seal to companies as something that “directly affects the purchase decisions of consumers”; each manufacturer is charged $14,500 for the evaluation. If it approves the product, the ADA then charges an additional annual fee of $3,500. The ADA says it rigorously evaluates products and makes no profit from the program. However, floss companies themselves are allowed to design the studies. "The funding can come from companies — no problem at all,” said dentist Marcelo W.B. Araujo, vice president of the ADA’s Science Institute, who joined the organization after serving as an executive for Johnson & Johnson. “The design can start from the company.” When flossing first gained acceptance, no proof was required of remedies. Dentist Levi Spear Parmly is credited with inventing floss in the early 19th century. By the time the first floss patent was issued, in 1874, the applicant noted that dentists were widely recommending its use. The ADA has been promoting floss universally since 1908. “They just looked into what they did every day in their clinical practice and what they would recommend for patients,” said Araujo. Dentist Damien Walmsley, scientific adviser to the British Dental Association, can be counted among the skeptics, according to the AP report. “It’s important to tell people to do the basics. Flossing is not part of the basics.” The AP report said floss can occasionally cause harm, as careless flossing can damage gums, teeth and dental work. Though frequency is unclear, it said floss can dislodge bad bacteria that invade the bloodstream and cause dangerous infections, especially in people with weak immunity, according to the medical literature. National Institutes of Health dentist Tim Iafolla acknowledged that if the highest standards of science were applied in keeping with the flossing reviews of the past decade, “then it would be appropriate to drop the floss guidelines”. Regardless, he added, people should still floss. “It’s low risk, low cost,” he said. “We know there’s a possibility that it works, so we feel comfortable telling people to go ahead and do it.”   Add comment Comments Name:  Email:  Submit Note: Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

The robot was seen in action this week at the b8ta store in Palo Alto, California, a gadget shop launched by former Nest employees. Pepper was on a demo loop at the store, so we weren’t able to fully interact with it. But the idea behind Pepper is that it’s supposed to interpret and respond to a variety of customer needs. Using a combination of 2D and 3D cameras in its eyes and mouth, plus four multi-directional microphones, Pepper is able to "read" four human emotions — happiness, joy, sadness, and anger — and respond accordingly. It rolls up to you, raises its hands in greeting when you introduce yourself, and turns its head toward you when you move or talk. It is toylike and adorable. What’s more interesting than Pepper’s supposed emotional quotient is its potential to know exactly what you’re doing in a store. Right now, more than 10,000 of these robots have been deployed across Japan or are in pilot trials in Europe, and the vast majority are being used in retail and hospitality businesses. A Pepper robot might know when you’ve entered a store, how much time you’ve spent there, how many products you interact with, or whether you seem happy or angry when you pick up a product. It will tell you, "That camera is 20 percent off," in its innocent-kid-voice, its big eyes blinking at you, and make you think about buying that camera. Pepper might tell you, "That camera is 20 percent off," its big eyes blinking at you, and make you think about buying that camera "When I was at P&G I didn’t know how many people walked into Walmart and saw our brands," Steve Carlin, Softbank Robotic’s vice president of marketing and business development, said in an interview with The Verge. "Now, I can." Of course, many retail stores already use cameras, sensors, and other technology to gain insights on customer intent, interactions, and purchases. But Pepper is an attempt to put a friendly face on sophisticated tracking technology that some consumers might even consider… invasive. "The key word is empathy," Carlin said. "Cameras and screens are very passive. Pepper creates empathy." He acknowledged that Pepper could face the same "issues" that any technology does when it comes to consumer concerns about privacy, but ultimately, it all depends on how the end user — in this case, the merchant or business paying for Pepper’s services — uses information. As my Verge colleague Sam Byford pointed out during his recent encounter with Pepper in Japan, there’s still little evidence of its true emotion-detecting capabilities at this stage. But it may get there someday, especially as developers begin to create apps that run on NAOqi, its proprietary OS. Pepper won’t be a permanent fixture in Silicon Valley; it’s just there for a week to let people know that it’s in the US, and to get app developers excited about it. Softbank Robotics executives say the robots will find their way into other US retail stores "before the end of the year." Merchants and other business owners will pay several hundred dollars a week for Pepper and its services, all of which is sold as a three-year subscription. But Softbank is betting its emotional robot will easily pay for itself.

Hot Topics: School Calendar Set 'Rumors' at LHS Kirk Cameron Event Fat Shack Opens Turkey Trot Remembring Hughes Stadium Premature Babies RH Line Police Calls Walmarts Loveland distribution center, which opened 20 years ago, remains major employer in the area By Shelley Widhalm,Loveland Reporter-Herald Posted:   12/18/2010 06:20:04 PM MST When the Walmart Distribution Center opened in Loveland 20 years ago, the 1 million-plus-square-foot facility was easily visible from I-25. Thats not the case anymore with The Ranch and several other businesses in the area of 1550 E. Crossroads Blvd. When we opened, it was us and a church and another business, said Loveland resident Bobbie Moyer, who has worked at the distribution center since it opened. Now, its hard to find us. The distribution center is one of two in Colorado and 147 nationwide. The state has 59 Supercenters, including two in Loveland, and nine discount stores, as well as 15 Sams Clubs. Moyer started and remained in the position of data processing systems operator, staying with the company because she liked the benefits and the companys stability, she said. Walmart trains you from the minute you walk in the door. You dont have to have any prior experience, Moyer said. Laura Bahlmann, also of Loveland, has been with the distribution center since its opening and, like Moyer, remained in the same position, that of distribution receiving. She works on the receiving dock, unloading, processing and labeling the freight that comes into the building. Ive always known where I stood with Walmart, Bahlmann said, adding that she likes the work she does. Its a nice stable job. ... Its nice to wake up in the morning knowing that a job is stable and there for you. Bahlmann and Moyer are among the more than 1,000 associates who work at Walmart Distribution Center 6019. Advertisement The center started with 350 associates, of which 65 still remain with the company. Why Loveland? Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which was founded in 1962, chose Loveland for the distribution center at a time when the company had no distribution centers and few stores in the western United States, said Dan Speed, general manager of the Loveland distribution center. The city stood out for its welcoming business environment and sense of community, along with its access to north-south and east-west highways for moving freight, Speed said. On its first day of business, Tuesday, Sept. 11, 1990, the Loveland distribution center shipped out 50,000 cases of products, Speed said, explaining that cases range from the size of a shoe box up to the size of a big-screen television set, he said. Today, the distribution center ships out an average of 150,000 cases a day, 24 hours a day, except for Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years Day. The Distribution Process Each day, the center receives truckloads of cases at the loading dock from vendors such as Tide and Proctor and Gamble. Employees scan the bar codes on the cases, 60 percent of which will be immediately shipped to the 85 stores the center serves, or shipped out the next day. The remaining 40 percent of the cases are put into inventory. The cases, which are labeled with where they are headed, are moved through the center by conveyer belt, which, if stretched out, would extend nine miles, Speed said. The cases that are shipped out fill orders the center received the night before to ensure there are no empty shelves in the Supercenters and discount centers that the distribution center serves. The Loveland center covers the general merchandise side of stores in most of Colorado and Montana, all of Wyoming and a few in Nebraska and South Dakota. It really is a competitive advantage for the company, said Dan Fogleman, spokesman for Wal-Mart, which is based in Bentonville, Ark. Part of the role of distribution centers is to get products to customers. We dont want merchandise in the warehouse. The distribution center conducts three operations, that of receiving and order filling, followed by shipping. Employees load the labeled products onto trucks to deliver to 21 or 22 stores at a time. The stores are organized into a batch, so that there are four batches of deliveries a day. The majority of products are in the boxes theyre received in. Some are broken down from the case, Speed said. There are certain products a store wouldnt sell a whole case of. Never Had a Layoff The distribution center has never had a layoff since it opened, has low turnover and has not had to run a help-wanted ad in more than five years, Speed said. Sixty to seventy percent of the management team came from the ranks of hourly associates, Fogleman said.

For Facebook to achieve the deepest, darkest dreams of Mark Zuckerberg, the company must become the first one that dominates both the kind of precision ads that built Google and the emotional ads that made TV the world's dominant marketing force. Facebook has so far cracked the first half of that equation, following in the footsteps of Google by locking down what's called "direct response" advertising. If I own a store in Brooklyn that sells running shoes, I naturally want to find people who are in the market for what I'm selling. If someone types "running shoes Brooklyn" into Google, the company has a pretty good clue that is a person I want. My store can pay to show a link to my website to this probable Brooklyn runner. Largely because Google became an efficient way for many businesses to find people who are looking for exactly what the businesses are selling, direct response ads make up the majority of online advertising. Facebook is pretty good at this type of advertising, too, again because we tell Facebook who we are and what we like. But dominating direct response ads with Google isn't enough for Facebook. About $200 billion is is spent each year on TV commercials, mostly on direct response's handsome brother, branded advertising. Brand ads are those TV commercials of a smiling couple driving an Audi through a snowy mountain range. The next time we go car shopping, Audi wants us to have this innate feeling that its vehicles will make us happy and beautiful. Away from the internet, brand ads make up a majority of advertising. And they're lucrative. The average cost to reach 1,000 people with a prime time TV ad was $50 in 2015, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis. The comparable ad price on Facebook was $5. Facebook wants these pricey brand ads desperately. Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg is fond of saying that for advertisers and their $500 billion budgets, the social network is like the Super Bowl every night. She's wrong. Facebook is way bigger than the Super Bowl. More than 1.1 billion people use Facebook daily. About 110 million people watch the Super Bowl telecast. Sandberg's pitch is about convincing advertisers to think of Facebook as a place that is even bigger than TV's biggest stage but with the stockpile of personal information to target ads only to people who are most likely to buy an Audi. In Facebook's view, it is the best of Google's bloodlessly efficient direct response advertising with the mass reach and charm of TV commercials. It sounds beautiful, but it turns out it can be hard to be both Google and television. The world's biggest advertiser, Procter & Gamble, told the Wall Street Journal that it found targeting niches like teenage shavers on Facebook generated too narrow an audience for P&G brands that need to sells millions of bottles of Tide and Gillette razors. This seems, I don't know, blindingly obvious? P&G said it won't spend less money on Facebook, but it and some other big advertisers seem to be falling back in love with TV. The top 100 marketers spent 1 percent more on TV ads in the first quarter of this year compared with the amount in the period a year earlier, according to a Morgan Stanley analysis published in May. That was a lift from a 2 percent decline in their combined TV ad spending last year. P&G was among a handful of top brand advertisers -- also including GM, Pepsi and Verizon -- that sharply increased their TV ad spending this year after pulling back in 2015. "Investors should feel better about TV's place in ad budgets today than they did a year ago," Morgan Stanley wrote. What's good for TV is probably not good for Facebook's ambitions in brand advertising. Still, the winds are at Facebook's back. Younger people in particular are spending more free time on their phones, including on Facebook, and less on TV. Facebook is expanding the pool of potential advertisers to small businesses that never advertised beyond the Yellow Pages. Facebook's commitment to online video -- which looks a lot like TV -- helps it lure brand ads, too. It won't be easy for Facebook, but the company knows it won't crack the next 95 percent of that advertising spending unless it figures out how to become the perfect advertising medium for companies hunting for the best blend of TV and the web.

According to the report, the global fatty alcohols market was valued at US$3.52 bn in 2014 and is anticipated to reach US$5.48 bn in 2023, expanding at a CAGR of 5.1% between 2015 and 2023. Fatty alcohols are aliphatic alcohols that are predominantly linear and monohydric. These can be saturated or have one or more double bonds. Based on the raw materials used, fatty alcohols are chiefly classified as synthetic or natural. Synthetic fatty alcohols are produced from petrochemicals such as olefins and paraffin, while natural fatty alcohols are based on renewable resources such as fats, oils, and waxes of plant or animal origin. Based on carbon chain length, fatty alcohols can be broadly classified into C6-C10, C11-C14, C15-C22 and other fatty alcohols. Fatty alcohols are primarily employed for applications such as detergents and soaps, personal care and cosmetics, plasticizers, flavors and fragrances, and metal working fluids. Growth in personal care products, and detergents & soaps industries is primarily estimated to drive the global fatty alcohols market in the next few years. However, volatility in prices of raw materials and overproduction of fatty alcohols are projected to hamper market growth during the forecast period. Growing sales of cosmetics and beauty products in BRIC countries is anticipated to offer growth opportunities to the fatty alcohols market from 2015 to 2023.

Broad application of C11-C14 fatty alcohols is the key reason for the dominance of the segment. C11-C14 fatty alcohols is also estimated to be the fastest growing market segment, closely followed by C15-C22 fatty alcohols, during the forecast period, owing to the increasing demand for various applications. In terms of application, detergents & soaps was the largest segment of the global fatty alcohols market, constituting more than 60% share in 2014. Personal care is projected to be another major application segment between 2015 and 2023. Personal care is likely to be the fastest growing application segment, due to the rising demand for fatty alcohols as emollients and emulsifiers in personal care products. Developing regions are expected to dominate the fatty alcohols market in the next few years, owing to rising population and improvement in lifestyle coupled with high disposable income especially in China and India. Asia Pacific is estimated to be the largest market for fatty alcohols, followed by North America, during the forecast period. The fatty alcohols market in Asia Pacific is also likely to witness significant growth, due to increase in demand for personal care products, detergents & soaps, and easy availability of raw materials.

According to the report, the global fatty alcohols market was valued at US$3.52 bn in 2014 and is anticipated to reach US$5.48 bn in 2023, expanding at a CAGR of 5.1% between 2015 and 2023. Fatty alcohols are aliphatic alcohols that are predominantly linear and monohydric. These can be saturated or have one or more double bonds. Based on the raw materials used, fatty alcohols are chiefly classified as synthetic or natural. Synthetic fatty alcohols are produced from petrochemicals such as olefins and paraffin, while natural fatty alcohols are based on renewable resources such as fats, oils, and waxes of plant or animal origin. Based on carbon chain length, fatty alcohols can be broadly classified into C6-C10, C11-C14, C15-C22 and other fatty alcohols. Fatty alcohols are primarily employed for applications such as detergents and soaps, personal care and cosmetics, plasticizers, flavors and fragrances, and metal working fluids. Growth in personal care products, and detergents & soaps industries is primarily estimated to drive the global fatty alcohols market in the next few years. However, volatility in prices of raw materials and overproduction of fatty alcohols are projected to hamper market growth during the forecast period. Growing sales of cosmetics and beauty products in BRIC countries is anticipated to offer growth opportunities to the fatty alcohols market from 2015 to 2023.

Broad application of C11-C14 fatty alcohols is the key reason for the dominance of the segment. C11-C14 fatty alcohols is also estimated to be the fastest growing market segment, closely followed by C15-C22 fatty alcohols, during the forecast period, owing to the increasing demand for various applications. In terms of application, detergents & soaps was the largest segment of the global fatty alcohols market, constituting more than 60% share in 2014. Personal care is projected to be another major application segment between 2015 and 2023. Personal care is likely to be the fastest growing application segment, due to the rising demand for fatty alcohols as emollients and emulsifiers in personal care products. Developing regions are expected to dominate the fatty alcohols market in the next few years, owing to rising population and improvement in lifestyle coupled with high disposable income especially in China and India. Asia Pacific is estimated to be the largest market for fatty alcohols, followed by North America, during the forecast period. The fatty alcohols market in Asia Pacific is also likely to witness significant growth, due to increase in demand for personal care products, detergents & soaps, and easy availability of raw materials. The global market for fatty alcohols is expected to expand at a moderate pace in the near future.

SEVEN reasons why the Olympic gymnast is an absolute superstar Nicole Vassell 12:21 pm - 12/08/16 0shares 0shares The US gymnast has just scooped ANOTHER gold medal at Rio 2016 TAGS: Olympics One of the best things about the Olympics is that every time it comes around, there is always a new talent that the world obsesses over. In the past, the games have led to hysteria over the likes of Tom Daley, Mo Farah and of course, Jamaica’s Usain Bolt. And in Rio 2016, the breakout star is undoubtedly US gymnast Simone Biles. Competing for the very first time, she’s already won two gold medals in the first week – and folks, she’s only 19! More: Tom Daley’s fiancé makes the sweetest dedication to him after Olympic success Regardless of the country with which your loyalties lie, it’s impossible to deny that Simone has completely wiped her competition – she won Thursday’s (11th August) all-around gymnastics competition more than two points ahead of her competition! The world is in love with her right now – and here are a few reasons why… 1. She’s the most decorated athlete of the moment, having won TEN World Championship awards since 2013 She just scooped the all-around prize in Rio after completing an amazing floor routine – but she’d also impressed with the same skills at the P&G Gymnastics Championships a couple of months before. Watch, and be amazed: 2. Her skills are so defined that she has her own move: The Biles! It’s “a double layout with a half-twist and a blind landing” – but if you can’t imagine it, it looks a little something like this: *fangirling* 3. Rumour has it, she might ACTUALLY be able to fly… 🚨 The best part of Simone Biles' routine. 🚨https://t.co/WTpK7D5zQG — Cycle (@bycycle) August 11, 2016 4.

World MEXICO & THE AMERICAS As Venezuela's farms and factories falter, the country struggles to feed its people Venezuela supermarket Juan Barreto / AFP/Getty Images Empty shelves in a supermarket in Caracas illustrate the ongoing food shortages afflicting Venezuela. Empty shelves in a supermarket in Caracas illustrate the ongoing food shortages afflicting Venezuela. (Juan Barreto / AFP/Getty Images) Chris Kraul and Mery Mogollon Just a decade ago, Venezuela was producing nearly all of the sugar it needed. But this week, 30,000 tons of imported Guatemalan sugar is being offloaded at the port city of Puerto Cabello for delivery to government-run supermarkets across the country, where desperate shoppers typically line up for hours to buy basic foodstuffs. In some ways, the sacks of sugar being lowered on pallets to waiting trucks at Dock 10 symbolize the plight of a country that has seen the production of sugar and other products plummet. Venezuela now imports 80% of all the sugar it consumes, and many economists say 17 years of socialist policies are to blame. Looting and unrest continue roiling Venezuela as shortages persist and protesters demand food Chris Kraul and Mery Mogollon Venezuela, where anger over food shortages is still mounting, continued to be roiled this week by angry protests and break-ins of grocery stores and businesses that have left five dead, at least 30  injured and 200 arrested, according to various news reports. The latest fatality came from the southwest... Venezuela, where anger over food shortages is still mounting, continued to be roiled this week by angry protests and break-ins of grocery stores and businesses that have left five dead, at least 30  injured and 200 arrested, according to various news reports. The latest fatality came from the southwest... (Chris Kraul and Mery Mogollon) Last year,  the country produced 242,306 tons of refined sugar, less than one-third of  the 740,000 tons produced in 2006 when the country came close to meeting annual consumer demand of 900,000 tons, according to figures from Fesoca, the Venezuelan sugar trade association. But 2006 also was the year that President Hugo Chavez nationalized 10 of the 16 privately owned sugar refineries and turned them over to worker cooperatives, part of his “21st Century Socialism” agenda. After taking office in 1999 and until his death in 2013, Chavez also seized thousands of acres of sugar cane plantations and made them communal properties. Comradely gestures to be sure, but sugar production has rapidly declined ever since the seizures. In May, scarcities got so bad that Coca-Cola temporarily suspended production of its popular line of soft drinks, saying it couldn’t buy enough supplies of the industrial sweetener. Sugar production isn’t the only sector battered by the policies instituted by Chavez and continued under his successor, President Nicolas Maduro. Beef, coffee, toothpaste, auto parts, toilet paper and various medicines are just some of the items that Venezuela once produced on a large scale and that now must be imported to meet domestic demand. At the same time productivity is plunging, the steep drop in global oil prices over the last two years has cut into oil revenue on which Venezuela depends for foreign currency and to bolster its budget. As a result, Maduro can’t afford to sufficiently increase imports of basic goods, which have already doubled from the mid-1990s, to meet consumer demand. The upshot: long lines of shoppers waiting hours outside stores to buy increasingly scarce household items. People line up to buy basic items outside a supermarket this week in Caracas. Once-booming Venezuela now suffers from shortages of food, medicine and basic goods. Juan Barreto / AFP/Getty Images People line up to buy basic items outside a supermarket this week in Caracas.

Once-booming Venezuela now suffers from shortages of food, medicine and basic goods. (Juan Barreto / AFP/Getty Images) Maduro insists it’s all the fault of an “economic war” waged by the United States. Juan Pablo Olalquiaga, president of Conindustria, the largest trade group of Venezuelan manufacturers, counters that industry has been decimated by nationalizations, government-imposed price and currency controls, as well as difficulties in obtaining component parts or materials to make things. The latter factor was cited by Kimberly Clark in July when the U.S.-based company announced it was closing its factory where it manufactured toilet paper, disposable diapers and feminine hygiene products. In a statement, the company said economic conditions in Venezuela made it “impossible” to do business here. Maduro called the closure illegal and promised to reopen and staff the factory with 1,000 laid-off workers, but analysts were skeptical that the factory would fare any better than the nationalized sugar mills. Kimberly Clark’s departure follows those of other multinationals since Maduro took office in 2013, including Clorox, Bridgestone, Procter & Gamble, General Mills and Ford, not to mention hundreds of domestic firms. Conindustria estimates that Venezuela has lost 1.2 million direct and indirect manufacturing jobs since 1999. “Two decades ago, Venezuela had 12,700 industrial companies,” Olalquiaga said. “Only 4,000 are left….The government of President Maduro has been absolutely incompetent in taking correct policies and so the deterioration of the few companies left has continued.” The auto industry has been hit especially hard. According to Cavenez, the Venezuelan automobile trade association, this year Venezuelan assembly lines are on course to produce around 4,000 cars. During the 1980s, Venezuela sometimes averaged upwards of  200,000 autos assembled yearly. Minister of Industry Carlos Farias, the Cabinet official in Maduro’s government responsible for managing the supply of consumer goods to the nation, is the latest to occupy the hot seat. His predecessor, Miguel Perez Abad, only lasted seven months on the job, and the minister before him, Luis Salas, for one month. Maduro’s appointment of Abad in January led some to think industrial policies might be redirected to stimulate private investment as a way to restart the country’s poor productivity.   But his abrupt firing Aug. 2, after making statements that seemed to presage free-market-friendlier policies, put an end to such optimism. Abad had favored liberalizing Venezuela’s currency laws and said in May that the government would cut down on imports to be able to pay its debts. See more of our top stories on Facebook » Maduro has hosted conferences with government officials and business leaders to attempt to “reactivate productive motors” and called on entrepreneurs to “break their piggy banks and bring your dollars.” But critics say he had done little to rectify the effects of nationalizations, price controls and scarcity of spare parts. So, any short-term reactivation of Venezuelan industry is a long shot and the economy could take years to recover. The International Monetary Fund expects inflation to reach 700% this year and the economy to shrink by 10 percentage points. The government will be hard pressed to pay $10 billion in foreign debt obligations this year. Meanwhile, Maduro’s Cabinet ministers accentuate the positive.  “Everything we have recovered is in the hands of the people,” said oil and mining minister  Eulogio Del Pino,  another Maduro hard-liner. “No steps backward.” Special correspondents Kraul and Mogollon reported from Bogota, Colombia, and Caracas, Venezuela, respectively.

Adblock Plus, which claims to be the most popular ad-blocking browser extension, has reacted to the social network’s move by accusing it of being “anti-user,” and that it “takes a dark path against user choice.” In a blog post, subtly titled “Oh well, looks like Facebook just got all anti-user,” Ben Williams, operations manager for Adblock Plus owner Eyeo, questioned just how effective ads were on Facebook. “It’s hard to imagine Facebook or the brands that are being advertised on its site getting any sort of value for their ad dollar here: publishers (like Facebook) alienate their audience and advertisers (the brands) allow their cherished brand name to be shoved down people’s throats. Yikes.” He also noted how Facebook described ads as “annoying” and “disruptive” in its own blog post. Williams may have a point; on the same day as Facebook’s announcement, Proctor and Gamble, the world’s largest ad spender, said it was moving away from targetted ads on the social network because they weren’t proving very effective. “We targeted too much and we went too narrow. And now we're looking at: What is the best way to get the most reach but also the right precision?" said P&G chief marketing officer Marc Pritchard to the Wall Street Journal. There’s a hint of hypocrisy about the outrage coming from Adblock Plus. Its controversial acceptable ads program allows companies to pay for their advertising to pass through the Adblock Plus filter. Eyoe has made a lot of money from the likes of Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Taboola, who make payments equivalent to 30 percent of ad revenues to be whitelisted.

Home Top 50 How To Magazine Franchise Events Subscribe 5 min read Marketing Strategies 4 Marketing Strategies You Need to Make HR Better Image credit: Shutterstock Henry Albrecht Contributor CEO of Limeade Make More Happen Watch What Happens When You Invest in Employee Wellness Henry Albrecht ON-DEMAND EVENT STRATEGIES TO GROW YOUR BUSINESS Watch Now August 10, 2016 HR pros play a lot of roles -- employee liaison, culture keeper, people leader, coach. But here’s a new idea -- the best ones are also marketers. They boost employer brand and improve the overall experience for employees. And when HR adopts marketing techniques, they can better manage talent. Here are the marketing principles every HR leader should incorporate: 1. Have a target audience. Marketers have a deep understanding of their audiences. They study demographics, attitudes and behaviors to create detailed customer personas and target messages to specific groups of people. Related: What HR Pros Need to Learn From the Rest of the Company HR can use the same strategy to better reach employees. After all, employees receive hundreds of emails every week -- yet 50 percent of those surveyed in theEMPLOYEEapp’s Mobile Trends in the Workplace survey said they still feel out of the loop. Why? Because the messages aren’t tapping into their interests. Start by learning everything about the employees targeted in the message. What motivates them? What are their goals? What do they value most? What are their concerns? What financial and non-financial “offers” will they respond to? How do these answers vary from department to department? Between managers and employees? Then, use this knowledge to target messages and HR programs to specific groups of employees, instead of sending generic information to everyone. For example, company announcements should look, feel and sound different depending on who the audience is -- different employees want different information in different ways. They want to know how it will affect them. How will it change their everyday work life? What’s in it for them? Let’s say the company is adding a new wellness program. The message to employees should outline the program and how it can benefit them. What are the rewards for participation? The message to team leaders, on the other hand, should outline ways to encourage their team to get involved. Think like a marketer to deliver the most relevant and important information to each employee. 2. Every channel. One brand voice. Marketers know that if they want to get the attention of their audience, they need to use more than one method. A campaign cannot be successful through emails and newsletters alone. Marketers use a mix of media to convey their messages. They use video, images, interactive websites, social media and more. In fact, the best marketing is viral -- it’s what other employees say about the programs. Related: A Comprehensive Guide to Building a Better Content Marketing Strategy And emails aren’t enough to reach employees. In theEMPLOYEEapp survey, 80 percent of employers said they use email to communicate, but 30 percent of employees said they ignore emails from their employer. According to Wrike’s 2016 Mobile Productivity Report, 90 percent of surveyed professionals believe a mobile device is critical to getting their jobs done. So use text messages, mobile apps, internal social networks and other mobile-optimized resources to communicate. Upload videos and pictures to engage employees in newsletters and announcements. Start a company blog and double down on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other platforms employees use. The more ways employees can access and digest information, the better. But reaching everyone with a wide array of uncoordinated themes, benefits, colors, and tone seems scattered. Would P&G, Unilever, Disney or the best brand-builders in the world take a shotgun approach to building the value of their most important assets? Have a strategy and a voice, and have them show up in everything the company does. 3. Bring it all together. Marketers want to make the buying process easy for customers. And like marketers, HR wants employees to “buy” into programs, initiatives and benefits enrollment. It connects them to their work in broader ways. When HR focuses on a branded employee experience, encouraging program participation becomes easier. Bring all programs, initiatives and information together in one easy-to-use platform. Think of it as a hub that integrates the most important HR benefits, programs and initiatives in one convenient place. Employees don’t have to switch back and forth between multiple websites and keep track of information separately. When they can access everything in as few places as possible, participation becomes so much easier. And, in many cases, it’s much easier for employers to manage, too. 4. Measure effectiveness. Marketers track and measure everything to find the best strategies, adjust what isn’t working and get the most bang for their buck. Data is everything in modern marketing. Related: HR Analytics: How Should Big Data Be Used in the Workplace HR teams can also track and measure data to continually improve processes. Decide what metrics are most important to the company culture and overall business goals and track them to drive employee engagement. Are employees responding to messages? Are they getting the right messages at the right time? Are they participating in programs? Are they happy? What can be done better? Some new HR systems learn about people and take action so employers don’t even have to. HR isn’t an easy job. But when leaders look at it from a marketing perspective, HR strategies can improve the employee experience and build a consistent and strong employer brand.  Henry Albrecht Henry Albrecht is the CEO of Limeade, the corporate wellness technology company that measurably improves employee health, well-being and performance.

 Your readers don't like being lied to Myles Udland Aug. 11, 2016, 9:18 AM 1,113 facebook linkedin twitter email print Here's an interesting chart from Mark May and the team at Citi.  Looking at branded content — specifically as it relates to Facebook's opportunity in the space — Citi found that 48% of US internet users felt deceived upon realizing an article or video was not a piece of news or commentary, but was in fact a commercial.  Certainly, readers don't like being lied to. This is more or less a standard human response. What else this chart tells us is a bit less clear. For instance: Do the 32% of users who clicked an ad they thought was an article but don't feel deceived enjoy the ad? Do they buy something from the ad? What about the 20% who don't know? Is it because "branded content" is sort of nonsense jargon people outside the advertising/media industry simply don't understand? And so on.  Citi More broadly, May's read on the branded content space for Facebook is that by clarifying its policies around these kinds of ads the company opens up opportunities for revenue inside of its Newsfeed. May notes that Facebook announced changes to its policies in April.  "The new rules will make the sponsorship nature of this type of content more transparent to users, and also clarify how media partners can better monetize this form of advertising across the Facebook network (note that the guidelines apply to many platforms, including Instant Articles and live videos)," May writes. "As such, we see this as a win-win-win for FB users, FB media partners/advertisers, and for FB itself." Earlier this week, reports indicated that Procter & Gamble, the world's biggest ad spender, would cut down on the number of targeted ads it placed on Facebook but not reduce its total spend on the platform.  The implication here, it seems, is that P&G feels branded content will be more effective. Particularly if readers don't feel deceived.  SEE ALSO: P&G, the world's biggest ad spender, is cutting back on targeted Facebook ads because they weren't effective NOW WATCH: Elon Musk just unveiled something that could revolutionize how you power your home Loading video...
