(KFSN) KFSN By Corin Hoggard Monday, May 01, 2017 06:32PM FRESNO, Calif. (KFSN) -- The deal is hard to beat. Smart & Final's five-gallon bucket of Tide laundry detergent sells for $24. Walmart's biggest box is about one-third the size for $13, so the bucket is quite a bargain - about a 40 percent discount. But a closer look suggests it may not be exactly what you think. "I thought about buying it, and then I did my research," shopper Alex Pike said. Pike found the bucket a couple months ago and thought it was a great deal, but she decided something looked unusual, so she gave it a closer look. Some of the writing is in Vietnamese. When we peeled back a sticker, we found out it's only supposed to be sold in Vietnam. Procter & Gamble produces Tide. And when people started asking about the big buckets on social media, the company said its products don't come in five-gallon buckets for retail sale. "Being a cloth diapering mother who goes through detergent like crazy, having a five-gallon bucket for real cheap was a good deal," Pike said. A spokeswoman told Action News they have two issues with the big buckets - one is the possibility of counterfeit sales. Police in LA arrested several people last year for buying and selling fake Tide in orange five-gallon buckets. The other is a Procter & Gamble product intended for professional use in Vietnam, but it's hitting store shelves here in the United States. The spokeswoman says "P&G does not sell or authorize anyone else to sell products in five-gallon buckets to the general public." A Smart & Final spokeswoman told us the company can assure customers the product is genuine. They say it "is legally imported for distribution in the United States and is safe to use." FoodMaxx sells the same buckets, and they also say they import the buckets from Vietnam. But Tide's makers say the product is meant to be used in Vietnam where the washing conditions are different than in the US, so the product may not be what American consumers are used to buying. So, we wanted to see how it compared to this typical Tide detergent. We asked the chemists at BSK Associates to find out whether the products are the same on a molecular level. We checked for phosphates, a powerful cleaning agent companies stopped using in the U.S. because of environmental concerns. EMBED More News Videos <iframe width="476" height="267" src="http://abc30.com/video/embed/?pid=1942479" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> Action News bought Tide in the five-gallon bucket and Tide in a smaller container and asked chemists to examine them down to a molecular level and see what they found. "This one also claims there's no Orthophosphate 38, so we're actually going to test the levels," Ian Huh with the lab said. And they checked for other possible differences as well. Procter & Gamble said they don't control the supply chain for the Vietnamese product, so the formula may be different and consumers like Pike may not get the results they usually get from Tide. Action News Anchor Corin Hoggard went to Smart & Final and bought Tide in the five-gallon bucket and Tide in a smaller container and asked the chemists to examine them down to a molecular level and see what they found. They started with a couple assumptions. "I wasn't sure if it was counterfeit or not, but if it was counterfeit I was anticipating there would be some kind of phosphate in it," Huh said. Manufacturers eliminated phosphates in American detergents more than 20 years ago because of environmental concerns, but the chemical compounds are not illegal in California, and they're considered a strong cleaning agent. But the spectrophotometer showed no phosphates in either product. In fact, it showed the bucket and the box both contained the same elements and compounds but in different amounts. "There was six times more surfactin in the five-gallon bucket," Huh explained. Surfactins are cleaning agents. In this case, the analysis showed a high amount of sulfates in the Vietnamese Tide. The chemists say the higher levels mean Tide from the bucket might have a different effect on your clothes than the domestic Tide. "It can result in potentially taking color out from your clothes," Huh said. The American Tide had more aluminum in it, which chemists say is often used as a water softener. So, with those results in mind, is the bucket a bargain to Alexandria Pike? "I would not go back and buy that bucket, knowing that it could dull your clothes because, in the long run, I'm not just washing my clothes," she said. "I'm washing clothes for three or four other people." The chemists, on the other hand, wanted what was left in the big bucket - but just for their whites.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman 4 Key Quotes From Procter &amp; Gamble Co.’s Earnings Call Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) last week announced earnings results for its fiscal third quarter. And, while the consumer goods giant didn’t lower its sales growth outlook , it warned investors about slowing industry trends that will keep pressure on revenue and profits. Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller held a conference call with investors after the announcement to add context to those issues. Here are the key highlights from that chat. 1. A weak industry gets weaker The quarter did present challenging macro dynamics…growth on our categories decelerated significantly. P&G saw its organic sales growth slip to a 1% rate after two straight quarters of surprisingly strong gains. The pinch happened both in its core U.S. market, where sales growth was cut in half compared to the prior quarter, and in developing markets, which saw their expansion pace fall to 4% from 5%. Image source: Getty Images. P&G said a few factors combined to drag results down in the U.S., including delayed tax returns, rising gas prices, and bad weather. Executives also noted what looked like a delay on the part of consumers in restocking their homes with consumer staples. Globally, the industry’s growth slowed to a 2% pace from 3% in the first half of the fiscal year. 2. Volume led growth For the third straight quarter, sales growth continued to be fueled by volume growth. On the bright side, P&G managed volume-led sales gains as pricing held flat, which set it apart from peers. In contrast, Kimberly-Clark (NYSE: KMB) competes with the company in the key diaper segment and endured a 1% drop in organic sales as it managed slightly higher volume at the expense of a significant decline in prices. Kimberly-Clark lowered its full-year outlook to just below 2% while P&G held its target in place, calling for between 2% and 3% organic gains. P&G said a 30% boost in e-commerce sales played a key role in this outperformance last quarter as the online segment grew to represent 5% of the business. 3. Cutting costs on packaging We’re aggressively driving cost savings to mitigate these impacts. Moeller said P&G is dealing with an „unprecedented amount of geopolitical disruption and uncertainty, which is affecting market growth, currencies and commodities.” In that context, the company is looking to dramatically reduce its expense structure to help keep profits churning higher. Executives have identified $7 billion of savings opportunities in the cost of goods sold line item — on top of the $7.3 billion they’ve cut out since fiscal 2012. PG Cost of Goods Sold (TTM) data by YCharts . The single biggest element of that cost plan is in packaging materials, where P&G sees $4.5 billion of savings coming through things like raw material supplier consolidation and the simplification of production lineups. 4. Things could get worse before they get better Looking forward, the external challenges we face, slow market growth, geopolitical and economic instability, foreign exchange impacts from a stronger U.S. dollar, rising commodity costs and retail trade transformation are all very real and aren’t likely to be meaningfully better in the near term. P&G’s short- and long-term challenges imply weak but steady growth. But, because the company outperformed management’s expectations in the first half of the year, the latest slowdown didn’t require a downgrade. The company still sees organic gains coming in at 2% to 3%, to put it just ahead of Kimberly-Clark and behind Unilever  and its expected 4% gain. At the same time, P&G’s management admitted that — three-quarters of the way through the year — they’re tracking at the low end of their target range. P&G’s main growth focus is on launching what executives called „irresistibly superior products.” They cited Tide Pods and Downy scent beads as two good examples; both franchises are driving industry-thumping sales and profitability boosts more than five years from their introduction. In the current selling environment, without a string of new hits like these, whether they come from fresh products or upgrades to existing brands, P&G’s industry segments will likely stagnate as its market share declines. 10 stocks we like better than Procter & Gamble When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) May 1, 2017 at 1:02PM Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) last week announced earnings results for its fiscal third quarter.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Better Buy: Procter & Gamble Co. vs. Philip Morris International Inc. Which consumer staples play is a better long-term investment? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) May 1, 2017 at 11:18AM Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) are both consumer staples heavyweights that usually hold up well during market downturns. Investors often buy both stocks for income and stability instead of growth -- but is either stock a smarter long-term play than the other? Let's examine their core businesses, growth trajectories, headwinds, dividends, and valuations to find out. What do P&G and Philip Morris International do? P&G's massive consumer staples portfolio includes common household names like Tide, Bounty, Pampers, Crest, Charmin, Gillette, Pringles, Pantene, and SK-II. It runs its business in five segments -- beauty, grooming, healthcare, fabric/home care, and baby/feminine/family care products. Image source: Pixabay. Philip Morris International was spun off of Altria (NYSE:MO) back in 2008. Following that split, PMI sold all of the Philip Morris brands (led by Marlboro) in overseas markets, and Altria became a purely domestic tobacco company. That split enabled PMI to expand in faster-growth overseas markets with higher smoking rates, and allowed Altria to tackle domestic litigation and declining smoking rates. How fast are P&G and PMI growing? Wall Street expects P&G's revenue to stay flat this year before rising just 2% to $66.8 billion next year. PMI's revenue (which excludes excise taxes) is expected to rise 6% this year and 9% to $30.8 billion next year. Both companies have been hurt by currency fluctuations over the past few years, so analysts generally look at their currency-neutral growth when assessing their growth. On an organic basis (which excludes the impacts of forex, acquisitions, and divestments), P&G expects its revenue to rise 2% to 3% this year. After excluding excise taxes, acquisitions, and currency impacts, PMI expects its revenue to grow 4% to 6% this year. On the bottom line, P&G's earnings are expected to grow 5% this year and 7% next year, as buybacks will offset its lackluster top line growth. On an organic basis, "core" earnings are expected to grow in the "mid-single" digits. PMI's earnings are expected to rise 9% this year and 11% next year -- or 9% to 12% after excluding taxes, acquisitions, and currency impacts -- but the company isn't relying on buybacks at all due to the strong dollar. Instead, it's consistently hiking prices and cutting costs to boost its earnings. Understanding the headwinds P&G is often criticized for being over-diversified, as the growth of its stronger brands (like SK-II) is often offset by lagging ones, with currency impacts exacerbating the pain. Last quarter, P&G's reported revenues fell annually across all segments except healthcare. On an organic basis, healthcare revenues rose 6%, grooming revenues dropped 6%, and the other three segments all posted just 1% growth. Image source: P&G. P&G is trying to streamline that portfolio with big divestments. It dropped about 100 brands in 2014 and sold its Vicks VapoSteam business to Helen of Troy in 2015. Last year, P&G sold 43 beauty brands to Coty and transferred its Duracell brand to Berkshire Hathaway. Meanwhile, PMI faces declining cigarette shipments, which plunged 11.5% annually last quarter. That decline can be partly attributed to waning smoking rates and tougher anti-smoking laws in key growth markets like Indonesia. PMI believes that new non-cigarette products like its IQOS "heatsticks" might eventually offset those declines, but those products still generate a tiny percentage of PMI's revenue. PMI is still the largest publicly traded tobacco company in the world, but it will be eclipsed by British American Tobacco (NYSEMKT:BTI) once its takeover of Reynolds American (NYSE:RAI) closes. That big move has fueled ongoing speculation that PMI will buy Altria to recombine the two halves of Philip Morris to counter British American. The dividends and valuations P&G currently pays a forward yield of 3.1%, which is supported by a payout ratio of 77%. It's hiked that dividend annually for sixty consecutive years. PMI pays a higher forward yield of 3.8%, but it also has a higher payout ratio of 92%. The tobacco giant has hiked that dividend every year ever since it split with Altria. P&G currently trades at 26 times earnings, which is much higher than its industry average of 20. PMI has a P/E of 25, which is also higher than its industry average of 15. Both stocks' prices and multiples were likely inflated by lower interest rates, which sent income investors flocking to blue chip dividend stocks over the past few years. But as interest rates rise, that trend could reverse and cause both stocks to drop to more reasonable multiples. The winner: Philip Morris International I'm not a big fan of either stock due to their high valuations and rising higher interest rates, but PMI's simpler business model, higher growth rates, softer currency impacts, and beefier dividends all make it a better consumer staples play than P&G. That being said, it might be wise for investors to wait for PMI to significantly pull back before starting a new position.  Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Continue Reading Below The money, more than 90% of which is stockpiled outside of the U.S., has drawn fresh attention as President Donald Trump has proposed slashing business taxes and a one-time tax holiday on corporate cash brought home. That could ratchet up pressure on the tech giant to make splashy acquisitions or dole out more money to shareholders. Apple's quarterly results will show the company has doubled its cash pile in just over 4 1/2 years. In the last three months of 2016, it racked up new cash at a rate of about $3.6 million an hour. As of December, the company had $246.09 billion total cash, cash equivalents, and securities. Apple, like many big American companies, parks most of that cash offshore rather than paying U.S. taxes on its overseas profits. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook early this year said he was eager to bring cash home if tax changes enabled it. Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said such a move would give Apple flexibility to do more capital returns. Neither has given detailed plans. One possible approach would be a special dividend. Apple could deliver such a windfall, benefiting investors including Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which more than doubled its Apple position in January. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Wall Street analysts tend to focus more on companies' net cash position than the headline number. Since 2012, Apple has gathered some $88 billion in debt to fund payouts to shareholders. But even subtracting that, Apple would be left with more cash than the total stockpile of Microsoft Corp., the next richest tech company, which has $126 billion in cash, not accounting for debt. With the exception of financial companies, Apple's stash exceeds that of any other U.S. company in recent history, said Jennifer Blouin, an accounting professor at University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. "I have never seen a company in this kind of extreme position, barring a winding-down," she said. "Apple's a cash box right now." Apple cash and cash equivalents are spread across short- and long-term securities, including corporate securities, U.S. Treasury securities and money-market funds. When Apple had its 1990s bankruptcy scare, then CEO Steve Jobs arranged a cash infusion from Microsoft, setting his resolve to keep reserves for future emergencies. Mr. Jobs also believed Apple could better boost its stock price by using its money to develop new products than through buybacks or dividends. His biggest product, the iPhone, has only supercharged the cash machine. Apple has sold more than 1 billion of the devices in the decade since it was introduced, and today claims 91% of all the profits in the smartphone sector. Mr. Cook has been somewhat more accommodating of shareholder desires than his predecessor. He started a program of dividends and stock buybacks in 2012 that has since sent more than $200 billion to shareholders. And he has invested more in some areas, such as research and development. But the CEO also stared down Carl Icahn in 2013 and 2014 when the activist investor bought a stake in Apple and demanded it increase buybacks. And Apple remains frugal in other realms, such as marketing. It spent less than $1.8 billion on advertising last year -- not even half the amounts laid out by smaller rivals Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., according to company filings. Apple also avoids large acquisitions. It bought at a rate of 15 to 20 companies a year over the past four years, generally spending several hundred million dollars on companies it can easily assimilate. Its biggest deal was the $3 billion it spent to buy Beats Electronics LLC in 2014. The swelling war chest, however, has fueled hopes for bigger deals to vault Apple in new directions such as self-driving cars and entertainment. At Apple's 2015 shareholder meeting, one investor asked Mr. Cook about buying Tesla Inc., which today is valued around $51 billion. The CEO didn't directly respond. Robert Nichols of Windward Capital Management Co., an Apple shareholder, says it should buy Netflix Inc., valued around $65 billion, to jump-start its video-streaming business and bolster its position against Amazon. "You can either build [content and distribution] or you can buy it," and buying would help Apple gain ground where it is behind, he said. With $250 billion, Apple could buy both Tesla and Netflix and still have plenty left over. It also might want to use some cash to pay down some of its debt or look to boost U.S. manufacturing after facing calls last year from then-President-elect Trump to build a plant in the U.S. Either way, a sense is growing that Apple's cash hoard has far outstripped its needs. "If this a rainy-day fund, they're saving for a millennial flood," said Lee Pinkowitz, a Georgetown University professor of finance.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Business Image Source: Niels Epting Apple has $250 billion in cash just lying around Yoni Heisler @edibleapple May 1st, 2017 at 5:54 PM Share Tweet The iPhone, in addition to turning the entire smartphone industry on its head, helped transform Apple into one of the most valuable companies on the planet. With a market cap bordering on $770 billion at the time of writing, not to mention a stock price trading at an all-time high, Apple investors are sitting pretty right about now. Tomorrow, Apple will release its earnings report for the quarter gone-by, and if iPhone sales check in higher than anticipated, Apple shares may skyrocket even higher. Don't Miss: Even more Galaxy S8 problems are beginning to pop up Ahead of Apple’s earnings report, The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Apple tomorrow will relay that it now has more than $250 million in the bank. Last we heard, Apple was sitting on $246 billion in cash. “Apple is expected to report Tuesday that its stockpile of cash has topped a quarter of a trillion dollars,” the Journal notes, “an unrivaled hoard that is greater than the market value of either Wal-Mart Stores Inc. or Procter & Gamble Co. and exceeds the foreign-currency reserves held by the U.K. and Canada combined.” Of course, the rub is that the vast majority of Apple’s cash resides in bank accounts overseas. Consequently, Apple has shied away from bringing that cash back to the U.S. as to avoid a 35% corporate income tax rate. The following chart via Statista illustrates Apple’s current cash situation. Stowing away cash overseas is hardly an efficient way to take advantage of  years worth of iPhone-fueled profits, but that may all change now that Donald Trump is President. During the course of the 2016 Presidential election, Trump’s tax plan listed on its website indicated that it will provide businesses with the opportunity to repatriate profits “held offshore at a one-time tax rate of 10 percent.” Suffice it to say, if Trump follows through on his promise, Apple stands to enjoy a staggering amount of tax savings. In a hypothetical scenario where Apple opts to repatriate $75 billion, it would save approximately $18.7 billion under Trump’s proposed tax holiday. In the meantime, Apple is in no rush to do anything drastic with its vast cash reserves overseas. Speaking to this point, Tim Cook relayed the following during a 2013 interview with the Washington Post: “If you look at it today, to repatriate cash to the US, you need to pay 35 percent of that cash. And that is a very high number. We are not proposing that it be zero. I know many of our peers believe that. But I don’t view that. But I think it has to be reasonable.” Tags: Apple View Comments Trending 1 Tech Nintendo can’t keep up with Switch demand, even using airplanes 2 Tech Even more Galaxy S8 problems are beginning to pop up 3 Tech The Galaxy Note 8 might fix everything that’s ‘wrong’ with the Galaxy S8 4 Tech The OnePlus 5’s camera will be fantastic if these leaked photos are real 5 Deals Amazon’s 15 best daily deals: Amazon Echo sale, Fitbits, Alexa smart plugs, Roku Ultra, and more Picked For You Nintendo can’t keep up with Switch demand, even using airplanes By Chris Smith May 1st at 11:03 PM Hubble just delivered one of the most gorgeous space photos ever By Mike Wehner April 30th at 3:00 PM Even more Galaxy S8 problems are beginning to pop up By Chris Smith May 1st at 7:45 AM Advertise About Contact Copyright 2017 BGR Media, LLC Powered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Terms Of Use ad Post to Cancel

Cottrill made his first foray into the agency world after holding top marketing positions at some of America’s biggest advertisers including P&G, Coca-Cola and Starbucks. He had been CMO at Converse for more than 8 years before leaving that role last February in order to “pursue other efforts.” Two months later, MullenLowe announced that he would replace Kristin Cavallo, who stepped down as president of the Boston office in September 2015 due to unspecified family obligations. In an interview with AdAge regarding the news, Cottrill said, “I offer a unique perspective and some level of empathy with the clients as we’re working with them in terms of understanding the seat they’re sitting in and the pressures they’re under,” stating that he had been “really impressed with the culture” at MullenLowe. A subsequent Forbes Q&A also focused on the perspective Cottrill brought to the agency, with the outgoing president saying, “As a client, sometimes we are so focused on what we were trying to do that we were missing the big picture. Agencies can provide perspective that’s broader. [Agencies] may be changing but they’re not going away.” The reasons for and circumstances surrounding his departure are not yet clear. Agency spokespeople declined to comment on the change or even confirm that it had occurred, but no mention of Cottrill or the news of his hiring last year could be found on the MullenLowe website this afternoon. According to the parties who brought the news to our attention, it was not a mutual decision. MullenLowe recently beat out several top shops including 72andSunny and Goodby, Silverstein & Partners and incumbent R/GA to become creative and strategy lead on E*TRADE before picking up creative AOR for Mount Gay Rum. The North American network did, however, go through a round of layoffs across most of its North American offices in January only days after officially becoming Chipotle’s new media AOR. That round of downsizing was specifically related to the loss of USAA, which moved its account to Publicis months after the “Ghetto Day” controversy led the financial services group to end its relationship with Campbell Ewald. (MullenLowe had already been working on portions of that business.)

Print   Email   Font Resize WTF: TP for Butt; duplicate tax returns Posted:   05/01/2017 03:43:14 PM MDT Charmin drops off load of toilet paper to Michigan's Butt Michigan tight end Jake Butt doesn't mind people having fun with his last name. The folks at Procter & Gamble sure are. The parent company of Charmin delivered a truckload of toilet paper to him in his hometown of Pickerington, Ohio, on Wednesday. The nature of the relationship between P&G and Butt is unclear. A request for comment was emailed to P&G. The gesture surely was a nod to Butt's last name, which elicits snickers wherever he goes. He embraces it. "I love it so much," he told ESPN last August. "I think that's one of my greatest traits. It has really allowed me to grow my platform and build my brand." Butt has made a name for himself as a football player for being a two-time Big Ten tight end of the year. He's one of the top players at his position available for the NFL draft, which starts Thursday. On Tuesday, Charmin tweeted, "Have you seen the #CharminDumpTruck driving through? We've got a special destination for a butt-load of TP" On Wednesday, a Columbus radio station, 97.1 The Fan, tweeted a picture of the load of toilet paper being dropped on a lawn with Butt standing nearby. 500 people get duplicate tax refund checks PROVIDENCE, R.I. — Five hundred Rhode Island residents have received duplicate tax refund checks totaling $364,000. A state official says human error is to blame. Advertisement The checks were sent in a group of refunds mailed Friday. The checks people received are identical, but only one of the two checks can be cashed. The Rhode Island Department of Administration and the Department of Revenue say they expect no financial impact. They say they're working to prevent duplicate checks from being mailed again. Department of Administration policy director Allison Rogers says people can cash one check and return the other to the state, along with a brief explanation.

The Cupertino company is likely to reveal it has topped a quarter of a trillion dollars – an amount that is double its cash pile from just four and a half years ago. The firm has been able to avoid US corporate taxes by keeping nearly 93 percent of its $246.09 billion total cash, cash equivalents and securities off shore – a route many major companies have taken. Scroll down for video  Apple is set to report its quarterly financial results on Tuesday, which is expected to greater than the foreign cash reserves of the UK and Canada combined. Firm is said to have topped a quarter of a trillion dollars, which is double its cash pile from just four and a half years ago Not only will Appel's results show a total of cash that is greater than two countries, but it is also said to exceed the market values of Wal-Mart Stores In and Procter & Gamble Co., Tripp Mickle reported with The Wall Street Journal, who also noted that the results exclude any and all Apple's debt. Apple cash and cash equivalents are dispersed throughout both' short- and long-term securities, including corporate securities, U.S. Treasury securities and money-market funds,' Mickle explained.

Share this article Share 313 shares Apple, among many other major corporations, keep a majority of their funds in other countries in order to avoid paying the 35 percent US corporate-income-tax rate. However, last week the Trump administration unveiled plans to dramatically cut taxes for US businesses and individuals, slashing the corporate rate to 15 percent, but the once-in-a-generation overhaul is headed for a tough fight in Congress. And The Wall Street Journal noted that if the plan were to go through, it would allow Apple to use their money wisely 'through acquisitions or by sending more to shareholders'. Apple CEO Tim Cook (pictured) is not opposed to bringing more cash to the US if the changes allow it and CFO, Luca Maestri, also explained that the changes 'would give Apple flexibility to do more capital returns' Apple CEO Tim Cook is not opposed to bringing more cash to the US if the changes allow it and CFO, Luca Maestri, also explained that the changes 'would give Apple flexibility to do more capital returns'. 'What we would do with it, let's wait and see exactly what it is, but as I've said before we are always looking at acquisitions,' Cook told investors on the company's first-quarter earnings call in January.  Last year, the tech giant was named as the biggest corporate tax avoider in the United States after booking $218.55 billion (£171.6 billion) of profit offshore last year. TRUMP'S MAJOR TAX CUTS  Slashing taxes on income and business was a key part of Trump's election platform. Under Trump's proposals, American companies would move from being the most highly taxed among the Group of 20 countries to among the lowest.  Tax rates would fall below those of neighboring Mexico and Canada, which Trump has accused of shortchanging the United States in trade deals. The plan's signature reform would be a dramatic reduction of the corporate tax rate, from the current 35 percent to 15 percent. Tax brackets for individuals would be compressed from seven to just three -- 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent, lower than the current top rate of 39.6 percent. Studies of the results of past tax holidays found that most of the offshore cash brought home by U.S. companies was used to buy back shares or make acquisitions, not to fund investments in production capacity or jobs.  The tech giant was able to save $65.08 billion (£51.1 billion) that it should have paid in tax thanks to its convoluted arrangements. The report revealed that last year three quarters of the Fortune 500 companies use subsidiaries in offshore tax havens where they sent a total of $2.42 trillion (£1.9 trillion) of income. In the US alone this amounted to $715.62 billion (£561.9 billion) in tax which they avoided paying. The report said many of the biggest companies in the world use a foreign office to 'disguise' their profits as coming from another country even if they are not.    Read more: Apple’s Cash Hoard Set to Top $250 Billion - WSJ Share or comment on this article e-mail 313 shares Most watched News videos Shocking footage shows aftermath of severe turbulence on Bangkok flight Incredible rescue of baby from capsized truck captured on video Awkward moment woman rejects marriage proposal at Fenway Moment car accident causes gas tanker to explode in Ohio Woman pops cyst with 16 gauge screwdriver and pushes out fluid Theresa May's embarrassingly quiet day of door-knocking in Scotland Excitable toddler performs his own version of the Haka dance Moment shooter opens fire at black pool party guests Baby elephant tossed around after getting in the way of a bull Kelly Ripa reveals Ryan Seacrest as her new co-host Canadian crowd sing entire Star-Spangled Banner when mic fails Terrifying moment tyre explodes into air and destroys car The flight from Hell: Horrific turbulence leaves 27...

She drove to a bridge near Exeter, climbed over the parapet, and jumped. "I don't remember the fall or the impact," she told the TedX Exeter festival. The fall should have killed her. It's what she wanted. Instead, she escaped with a broken pelvis and numerous other broken bones. "As I was being taken to hospital, two policemen were knocking on my door and breaking the news to my husband," she said. On the face of it, Gill had been "living the dream" in Devon, after moving west with her husband and children in search of a better quality of life. But living the dream did not go quite according to plan, she told the TedX Exeter audience at the Northcott Theatre. Gill became severely depressed. "I just seemed to shut down," she said. At night she would lie awake from 1am. By sunrise, she would be "disgusted that I still existed. I convinced myself that my family would be better off without me," she said. She thought about suicide a lot, and half tried it a number of times. On the fateful night in 2013 she went all the way. Every day in Britain, 17 people succeed in committing suicide, and 17 families have to come to terms with the loss, she told an audience of 900 in the theatre on the University of Exeter campus and some 10,000 around the world. Her recovery took off thanks to the messages that flooded in – and in particular a knitted bookmark from her daughter's ten-year-old classmate, George. The bookmark carried one word: "Hope". Yet official help was slow to come. She waited two and a half years on the NHS waiting list for psychotherapy. "Despite Government promises, mental health services have struggled with years of under-funding," she said. By sharing her story of recovery, Gill aims to spread hope to others with depression, to challenge some of the beliefs around mental illness and to encourage us to all to play a role in the mental-health revolution. "Depression isn't a weakness or a character flaw," she said. "It's an illness. People can learn to recognise depression so that early intervention will prevent it escalating. "Challenge stigma. Even today, well-meaning friends refer to this episode as 'my accident'," she said. "Tell it like it is." Confession: I was a would-be jihadist "For the first 16 years of my childhood, I just wanted to sacrifice my life in jihad," a Pakistani woman confessed to a Westcountry audience. Gulalai Ismail was one of the speakers at the TedX Exeter event at the Northcott Theatre in Exeter. An audience of 900 listened in stunned silence as Gulalai described her early years in a remote Pakistani village, where most of the young people were being groomed for a life of holy war. She was saved by her father's pacifist beliefs. The family fled the village, and Gulalai went on to found Aware Girls with her sister, Saba. Driven by a passion to challenge a culture of intolerance and extremism, Gulalai and Saba began running workshops in their home town to provide girls and young women with leadership skills to challenge oppression and fight for their rights to an education and equal opportunities. Their youth-based network, they believe, has since saved the lives of 10,000 young people, who have been steered away from violent jihad. "So many places in the world are ripe for radicalisation," she warned. "Extremist violence knows no borders." Last year 2016 Aware Girls was awarded the Chirac Peace Prize. The TedX event was broadcast live around the country and the world, with more than 10,000 people registered to watch online. Disabled teen refugee's tale of nightmare trip to safety A teenage Syrian refugee in a wheelchair won a standing ovation. Nujeen Mustafa, who has cerebral palsy and cannot walk, braved the Mediterranean in search of an education and medical treatment. Growing up in Syria, Nujeen was unable to go to school. She learned English by watching American television programmes while stuck in a fifth-floor Aleppo apartment without a lift "which made hanging out a bit difficult". When civil war broke out Nujeen and her family joined thousands of displaced people. "Before I realised it, I was on that rubber dinghy. We were the happiest people on earth." She described the challenges of adapting to a new life in Germany – from learning the language to adapting to eating with a knife and fork when traditionally she had used a spoon. She tells her story in a new book, The Girl from Aleppo, co-authored by Christina Lamb, chief foreign correspondent at The Sunday Times, who also spoke at the event. Ms Lamb, who has been a reporter for 30 years, said: "Over the past year I have seen worse things than ever before." But she said she carried on with her work as a war correspondent, because "it's in the darkest skies that you find the brightest stars". "To me, women are the real heroes of war," she said. "They are the ones who feed, protect and shelter their children." Virginie Helias, global sustainability brand director at consumer goods multinational Procter & Gamble, highlighted the damage being done to the seas by discarded plastics. She is a pioneer of using big brands to drive change. "Procter & Gamble products have been part of the problem, and we want them to be part of the solution," she said. The company has produced a limited edition of the best-selling Head & Shoulders shampoo in bottles made from plastics found on beaches. The event included performances from the Devon drumming collective Kagemusha Taiko and Plymouth-based dance company Street Factory. This is TEDxExeter's 6th annual ideas festival. Tickets for the 900-strong event sold out in minutes. Comment: Keith Rossiter … How to make your voice heard by listening It's not the despair I mind so much… it's the hope, John Cleese said, as he battled to overcome fate's persistent obstacles in the movie Clockwork. If ever we've needed hope, it's now. Life must have been worse for Europeans caught up in the Second World War, but at least in Britain they had a common cause to unite behind, and leaders with the power to inspire. Entire generations will have gone by not knowing a society as divided or even falling apart as it is now. What started with the banking crisis in 2008 has ended up with Brexit, the health and social care services in crisis, and welfare payments being slashed. It's possible to make a case to defend quantitative easing that made bankers richer and the rest of us poorer. Half the country will be delighted about Brexit, that's inevitable about any democratic vote. What's unusual is the depth of despair felt by the other half. People have always moaned about abuse of welfare, so the Conservatives must have thought that reforming the system was a certain winner. Pet owners leave me feeling like the underdog - Keith Rossiter After 20 years Ben Bradshaw 'has more fire in his belly than ever before' Is it time to replace politicians with machines? Keith Rossiter column But alongside banking, welfare abuse seems trivial. Most of us struggle to pay our mortgage or rent every month; yet the homeless person sleeping the underpass would gladly change places. Perhaps the Syrian refugee would gladly change places with the homeless person, who at least isn't being bombed. The inequalities in British society have never seemed more visible, and the general election called by Theresa May last week will do nothing to paper them over. So I went to the TedX Exeter festival on Friday, hoping to find some solace in its theme of "hope", some inspiration from a range of speakers from war correspondent Christina Lamb to Pakistani peace campaigner Gululai Ismail. Perhaps the most telling comment came from Syrian refugee Nujeen Mustafa, who is disabled. The teenager made the perilous journey from Syria in a wheelchair. She escaped to Turkey, and then took passage on a small inflatable raft to Greece. She finally made it to Germany, where she now lives in Cologne. Nujeen visited London for the first time on the way to give her talk to the Exeter festival of ideas. She said she marvelled at how we in Britain "had it all" – until she realised that Syrians, too "once had it all, and now it's all gone". The rifts in society opened up by last year's referendum result are threatening to become great gulfs over the six weeks until the election. There's a danger that we, too, will wake up one day soon and discover that whatever we had which made Britain great has all gone. As Exeter schoolboy James Craig told TedX, we got here because people weren't listening to each other. "Listening to someone else's argument dramatically increases the chance of them listening to yours," he told the Northcott Theatre audience. Between them, Nujeen and James could teach our electioneering politicians a thing or two. READ NEXT Royal Marines launch last-ditch bid to save HMS Ocean from being...

The company’s cash pile continues to grow at a substantial pace. According to a new report, Apple’s cash pile has surged to over $250 billion. That’s a quarter of a trillion dollars. This is an enviable cash pile that’s almost unheard of, it’s greater than the foreign currency reserves of many countries combined. The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple is going to confirm the figure in its quarterly earnings release today. It will confirm that it’s sitting on cash reserves of more than $250 billion. That’s more than the market value of both Walmart and FMCG giant Procter & Gamble put together. It’s even greater than the foreign currency reserves held by the United Kingdom and Canada combined. It’s a safe assumption that Apple’s cash pile has crossed $250 billion because the last confirmed figure from Apple put it at $246.09 billion in December last year. It was racking up cash at a rate of $3.6 million an hour in the final three months of 2016. Apple has already been under increasing pressure from shareholders to spend some of the cash it’s hoarding to further increase shareholder value. There are many ways it can do that one of which includes a special dividend. Apple can also use the money that it has to buy companies, no wonder there are rumors of Apple considering an acquisition of Tesla or Netflix. Given the amount of money it has, Apple can buy both companies and still be left with cash in the bank. It may even have to face mounting pressure to bring back some of that cash to the United States, considering that more than 90 percent of that $250 billion is held outside the United States.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    American companies looking to avoid paying domestic tax rates reportedly are holding about $2.6 trillion in overseas earnings. That number has been rising steadily for years, according to new research from Capital Economics. The top companies of overseas holdings are Apple, Pfizer and Microsoft, according to a report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. General Electric and IBM round out the top five, CNBC reported. Apple's stockpile of cash reportedly has topped a quarter of a trillion dollars, an unrivaled hoard that is greater than the market value of either Wal-Mart Stores Inc. or Procter & Gamble Co. and exceeds the foreign-currency reserves held by the U.K. and Canada combined, The Wall Street Journal reported. Apple's money, more than 90% of which is stockpiled outside of the U.S., has drawn fresh attention as President Donald Trump has proposed slashing business taxes and granting a one-time tax holiday on corporate cash brought home, WSJ.com reported. "Those policies could ratchet up pressure on the tech giant to dole out more money to shareholders or make splashy acquisitions," the WSJ explained. Meanwhile, CNBC reported that at 35 percent, the U.S. corporate tax rate is the highest in the world. That's caused many multinationals to keep their overseas earnings abroad in tax shelter countries like Ireland and Luxembourg. However, approval of the broader plan that entails the tax holiday is unlikely, according to Andrew Hunter, U.S. economist for Capital Economics. "With the deep cuts to individual income and corporate tax rates estimated to increase the federal budget deficit by $7 trillion over a decade," he wrote, CNBC reported, "there is next to no chance of the plan ever being approved by Congress in its current form." The main obstacles for the Trump tax plan are Senate rules. While reconciliation bills need only a majority in the Senate, they cannot increase the deficit beyond a 10-year horizon, which the tax plan is estimated to do. The alternative is to garner 60 votes in the Senate and be signed into permanent law. "The chances of the latter happening are close to zero," Hunter wrote. Meanwhile, many other respected economic voices are predicting robust growth and additional stock-market gains amid Trump's blueprint to truly "Make America Great Again." David Horowitz, author of the best-selling book "Big Agenda: President Trump's Plan to Save America," told Newsmax TV that the market rally since Republican Donald Trump won the election has more room for gains as the president pushes his pro-business agenda. “There's more upside. Starting from when he was president-elect he started this stock market boom,” he told Newsmax TV's “The Income Generation Show.” “There will be corrections. There are going to be setbacks along the way like the healthcare which they hurried too fast. If you're looking over the long term of this administration I think the stock market is going to love Trump,” Horowitz said. Other respected economic gurus agree. Trump has a victory coming, "a home run," with his tax-reform plan announced this week, but expect some "back and forth" debate as with healthcare, economic pundit and Trump campaign adviser Larry Kudlow said Sunday, per The Hill. "I can't think of anything better for business, better for wage earners, better for economic growth than Trump's 15 percent tax cut plan," Kudlow told "The Cats Roundtable" on 970 AM-N.Y. "I think it's a home run." Kudlow acknowledges there will be still be considerable debate, perhaps even a "struggle," in getting the game-changing reform passed in a stalemated Congress that has blocked everything President Trump has tried to do to date.

Joe Mullin - May 1, 2017 12:59 pm UTC Enlarge / A customer buying a new iPhone in Russia. Sergei FadeichevTASS via Getty Images reader comments 217 Share this story When it reports its quarterly financial results on Tuesday, Apple will likely have a quarter-trillion dollars in cash in the bank. That's a greater hoard than any other company in recent US history, according to the Wall Street Journal, which reported the numbers on Sunday. For comparison, Apple's cash pile exceeds the market value of Walmart and Procter & Gamble. The sum is more than the foreign cash reserves of the UK and Canada combined. Further ReadingApple sets revenue and iPhone sales records in Q1 of 2017Some 93 percent of the company's cash and other liquid assets are kept overseas. The Trump administration has proposed a tax holiday to encourage companies to bring money back to the US, as well as a lower corporate tax rate, fueling more speculation about how Apple will use its money. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he's interested in moving some of the company's cash stateside if tax conditions are right. One possibility is delivering a huge dividend to shareholders. Another is the possible acquisition of companies that are true giants in their own right. Capital managers suggested to the WSJ that Apple could buy a company like Tesla, valued at $51 billion, to push forward a self-driving car project. Another idea is buying Netflix, valued at $65 billion, to work on video-streaming and as a hedge against Amazon. An even more outlandish idea—still within the realm of possibility—would be to buy The Walt Disney Company, which has a market cap of more than $180 billion. Apple also has around $88 billion in debt to fund shareholder payouts. But even subtracting that amount, Apple has by far more cash than any other company. The second richest tech company is Microsoft, which has $126 billion, not counting debt. Another writer previewing Apple's earnings over the weekend, MarketWatch columnist Tim Mullaney, said that the "seemingly foolish call" he made two years ago—that Apple's stock could hit a value of $1 trillion by 2017—may well come to fruition. Apple set revenue and iPhone records last quarter, although growth in China slowed a bit.

The goal of a capitalist, free market-based society is that as companies get more successful, they invest their winnings back into the company, increasing productivity, hiring more people, and thus improving the overall state of the economy. While inherently flawed, this system has brought us a lot of good, and has lifted quite a number of people out of abject poverty. However, one has to ask what individuals and corporations hoarding this much money as Apple is doing are contributing to society. Apple's 250 billion dollars are locked away, and aren't used for anything. Every day, Apple is extracting vast sums of wealth from society - as they should in a capitalist society - but they are no longer investing it back into society. And Apple isn't alone in this, of course - a rich few are extracting immense amounts of wealth from society without giving back. This breaks the traditional capitalist model. Things like increased automation and robotisation are only going to accelerate this process. At some point, we're going to have to stop and ask ourselves if this is tenable, and if not, what we are going to do about it. It goes against the core 'values' of die-hard capitalists, but we might reach a point where we have to forcibly - through law - take it from companies like Apple.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Samsung Patent Reveals Possible Future Smartphone with Full Wraparound Display & Smart Spine Feature | Main | Samsung Seeks to Join the Micro-LED Display Race along with Apple, Sony and Oculus » May 01, 2017 Apple's Cash to Top a Quarter Trillion Dollars with 90% Overseas   It's being reported today that Apple is expected to report Tuesday that its stockpile of cash has topped a quarter of a trillion dollars, an unrivaled corporate hoard that is greater than the market value of both Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co. and exceeds the combined foreign-currency reserves held by the U.K. and Canada combined.   The Wall Street Jounal reports that more than 90% of Apple's money "is stockpiled outside of the U.S., has drawn fresh attention as President Donald Trump has proposed slashing business taxes and a one-time tax holiday on corporate cash brought home. That could ratchet up pressure on the tech giant to make splashy acquisitions or dole out more money to shareholders.   Apple's quarterly results will show the company has doubled its cash pile in just over 4 1/2 years. In the last three months of 2016, it racked up new cash at a rate of about $3.6 million an hour.   As of December, the company had $246.09 billion total cash, cash equivalents, and securities. Apple, like many big American companies, parks most of that cash offshore rather than paying U.S. taxes on its overseas profits.   Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook early this year said he was eager to bring cash home if tax changes enabled it. Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said such a move would give Apple flexibility to do more capital returns. Neither has given detailed plans.   One possible approach would be a special dividend. Apple could deliver such a windfall, benefiting investors including Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which more than doubled its Apple position in January.   With $250 billion, Apple could buy both Tesla and Netflix and still have plenty left over. It also might want to use some cash to pay down some of its debt or look to boost U.S. manufacturing after facing calls last year from then-President-elect Trump to build a plant in the U.S.   Either way, a sense is growing that Apple's cash hoard has far outstripped its needs. "If this a rainy-day fund, they're saving for a millennial flood," said Lee Pinkowitz, a Georgetown University professor of finance.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

2025 - Research and Markets News provided by Research and Markets 01 May, 2017, 11:45 BST Share this article DUBLIN, May 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Bio-based Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) Market Analysis By Application (Bottles, Technical, Consumer Goods), By Region (North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Central & South America), And Segment Forecasts, 2014 - 2025" report to their offering. The global bio-based Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) market is expected to reach USD 6.73 billion by 2025 Growing demand for sustainable packaging solutions including bottles and cartons is expected to drive the demand for bio-based PET. The adoption of Kyoto Protocol in economies, such as Japan, Australia, and Canada, and the Montreal Protocol in the U.S. and Canada, are expected to further restrict the use of products contributing to GHG emission, thus, driving the demand for bio-based products such as PET. Consumer goods are projected to witness growth at a CAGR of 11.2%, in terms of volume, from 2016 to 2025. Rising demand for eco-friendly packaging among personal care companies including P&G is expected to play a vital role in increasing the market size for bio-based PET in consumer goods. Further key findings from the report suggest: Bio-based PET is used in the form of sheets, foams, and fabrics for automotive and electronics applications. High shatter resistance and light weight properties are expected to fuel bio-based PET demand for the manufacturing of internal and exterior automotive parts. Europe was the second largest market, which is likely to account for 27.1% of global volume by the end of 2025. Rising awareness about reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the manufacturing sector in accordance with the implementation of Horicon 2020 Strategy on a regional level is expected to remain a favorable factor. Central & South America is projected to be one of the most lucrative destinations for producing bio-based PET on account of abundance availability of sugar alcohol sources including corn and sugarcane in Brazil. In addition, rapid growth of soft drinks market in Brazil is expected to remain a key driving factor over the next nine years. Rapid industrialization across the Middle East is anticipated to drive the growth of various sectors such as construction, packaging, electronics, and automotive in the region which is expected to play a fundamental role in increasing the demand for bio-based PET over the next nine years. The market is estimated to be worth USD 241.6 million by 2025. The market is marked by the presence of few players including The Coca-Cola Company, Toray Industries Inc., Teijin Limited, M&G Chemicals, and Toyota Tsusho.

In a country as diverse as India, one would think that showcasing a human rights issue could land a company in a social media minefield. But Vicks scored praise for its touching story of a transgender mother and the child she raised as her own. One month after it was posted on YouTube, the story has well over 9 million views – and, overall, garnered an enthusiastic reception worldwide. Companies are increasingly wading into social issues while promoting their products, or as they often infer, seeking to raise awareness of an issue keen on their stakeholders’ minds. Not everyone is a fan of what is sometimes called “sadvertising,” but the evidence suggests that it can work – either by gaining consumers’ trust or landing the company a prominent spot in the newswires. Occasionally, the fallout can be a public disaster: Witness the scorn heaped on Pepsi’s faux protest video starring Kendall Jenner, which PepsiCo pulled from its own YouTube channel. Other campaigns have seen more mixed reviews, such as Starbucks’ foray into a discussion of race relations during the height of the Black Lives Matter movement two years ago. Honey Maid’s parent company, Mondelez, says its definition of families is both wholesome and inclusive, as demonstrated by past Honey Maid graham cracker advertising campaigns portraying families of same-sex partners. But for Vicks to produce this tribute, which is 3.5 minutes long, is a bold statement about transgender rights. In the video, a young girl, Gayatri, tells the story of how she lost her mother at a young age and never knew her father. She was then raised by Gauri Sawant, who was born a boy, then declared that she was a woman during her teenage years. The story of their relationship unfolds as any mum-daughter story would, until the end, when Gayatri asks: “In our civics text books, we read that everyone is entitled to the same basic rights. Then why is my mom denied them? This is why I’m not going to be a doctor, but a lawyer. For my mom.” As NPR noted, the story is true, and the two main characters play themselves in the video. But a few details are left out. NPR reported that Gayatri’s mother was a sex worker who died of AIDS when her only child was 6 years old; it was then that Gauri, then 27, took the child under her wing and raised her as her own. But in an interview with India Today, Gauri claimed she adopted the child after her parents made it clear they were going to sell their daughter. Not everyone has been enthusiastic over the video. One Indian blogger asked whether Vicks and its parent company, Procter and Gamble (P&G), which by some accounts is anywhere from the third to ninth largest consumer packaged goods company in India, is actually sincere about their concerns for transgender people or whether this was exploitation for the sake of branding. But across social media, including on YouTube, the feedback was largely positive. “Made me cry” is a common refrain. Full acceptance of transgender people, and the LGBT community in general across India, still faces a long road ahead. Three years ago, the country’s supreme court issued a landmark ruling declaring that all individuals — regardless of their sexual preference, gender identity, or even if they declared themselves as “third” or “no” gender at all — are entitled to full legal recognition. Earlier this year, the first school for transgender students opened in the southern state of Kerala; the school’s founders, however, insisted in a Deutsche Welle profile that social and legal discrimination against transgender citizens is still the norm. Efforts like those by P&G may be only a pebble making waves in a massive pond of discrimination and scorn heaped on the LGBT community. But at a bare minimum, these videos produced by trusted brands succeed in raising awareness and help to inspire debate; not showing these people at all only makes these citizens feel as if they should be in the closet. Those closet doors, however, are being busted down worldwide, and in the end these changes are a net positive for everyone in society.

Thanks for reading and your comments.        See you all again tomorrow morning from 9. 4:43pm on 1 May 2017 If the Reserve Bank was still retaining its narrow focus on keeping inflation between 2 and 3 per cent per annum, it would be cutting interest rates at its May meeting on Tuesday. Futures traders and economists are almost certain it won't, and will, instead, keep rates steady for the ninth straight month when it meets tomorrow. Market economists are glad for the RBA's ability to look beyond inflation rates when setting the interest rate – though opinions differ on what exactly it should be focusing on. The domestic economic is growing, but still weak. And the currency is still high – factors that some say should lead the RBA to cut rates. But record-low interest rates, others argue, have added oomph to booming housing markets in Sydney and Melbourne, leading them to conclude raising interest rates would be the most effective way to address this. "I think they should be cutting," said Market Economics' Stephen Koukoulas, an economic adviser to former prime minister Julia Gillard. "We had confirmation last week that underlying inflation has been stuck below the bottom of the target band for what, 18 months, and shows few signs of picking up. "We've got no prospect of underlying inflation moving into the target. "Add to that unemployment edging up, underemployment high, retail sales weak ... to me those criteria would suggest that we need lower rates." If the RBA were solely concerned with inflation-targeting, it would be cutting to 1 per cent, said Capital Economics' chief Australia/New Zealand economist Paul Dales. The Australian economy, he said, would benefit from a lower currency.  "One thing [RBA] governor [Philip] Lowe has communicated effectively is his growing concerns about financial stability. That's why economists are thinking on these lines – governor Lowe himself said he's concerned about dealing with a mess in five years' time when the housing market pops. "I think interest rates should be around where they are – and should stay there for a long time. It's not an ideal situation ... but now is not the right time to keep going [at inflation]."

Housing prices, which have in Sydney doubled since 2009 and are contributing to high indebtedness of some households - a topic RBA Governor Philip Lowe is due to give a speech about on Thursday. Photo: Bloomberg 4:38pm on 1 May 2017 Shares have ended at the session's high and now within 50 points of the elusive 6000-point level after news late morning suggested US congress had managed a deal that would avoid a government shutdown helped push Wall St futures higher and helped the ASX overcome its early wobbles. OK, that's a long lede, but stay with us. The ASX 200 added 32 points or 0.5 per cent to 5956, preparing for another assault on the 6000-mark - a threshold it tried and failed to overcome on four different occasions some 2 years ago. Its looking increasingly likely the banks will push us over the brink thanks to what are expected to be strong earnings numbers in the coming days. They moved in and out of favour this morning before ultimately pushing higher: Westpac added 0.7 per cent, ANZ 0.6 per cent, NAB 0.3 per cent and CBA 0.1 per cent. Macquarie added 1.2 per cent. Only one in four of the top 200 names were lower, reflecting the day's gains was more than a financial sector story. Telstra's 0.9 per cent gain was a help, as was a 1.4 per cent jump in Wesfarmers and a more modest 0.6 per cent gain. BHP added 0.7 per cent, but Rio and Fortescue lost 1 per cent. South32 fell 2.2 per cent. Mayne Pharma was the worst performer in the top 200 after announcing lower than expected sales from its generic drugs portfolio. Outside the bigger names, footwear retailer RCG Corp plunged 27 per cent on an earnings downgrade. Winners and losers today in the top 200. Photo: Bloomberg 4:18pm on 1 May 2017 In our latest instalment of "healthcare stocks behaving badly" (allegedly): Australia's largest private hospital operator Ramsay Health Care is being accused of threatening to reduce surgeons' access to operating theatres in Coffs Harbour if they became involved with a competitor. Competition regulator ACCC brought a Federal Court claim against Ramsay on Monday, alleging misuse of market power and exclusive dealing. ACCC alleges when Ramsay became aware that a group of Coffs Harbour surgeons were planning to establish a competing private day surgery facility in Coffs Harbour, senior Ramsay executives told these surgeons if they became involved with the competitor Ramsay would substantially reduce or withdraw their access to operating theatre time at Baringa Hospital. It is alleged the surgeons suspended their plans to establish a competing day surgery as a result of Ramsay executives' threats. Ramsay operates Baringa Private Hospital and the Coffs Harbour Day Surgery, the only private hospital and private day surgery facilities in the Coffs Harbour region. "New independent day surgeries in other areas have increased competition, reduced waiting lists and costs, delivered greater choice, and improved access to surgical procedures. It is vital to ensure such competition is not stamped out by established operators," ACCC chairman Rod Sims said. "Misuse of market power and other anti-competitive practices can cause significant harm to consumers, other businesses, and the competitive process more generally, which is why we believe this is an important case for us to take," he said. ACCC is seeking pecuniary penalties, declarations, compliance program orders and legal costs against Ramsay. Ramsay said in an ASX statement it intends to vigorously defend the matter. "As the matter is now before the court, Ramsay will not be making any further comment ont he allegations other than as required to keep the market informed in accordance with its continuous disclosure obligations." Ramsay shares fell 1.4 per cent today to $70.70. 3:37pm on 1 May 2017 Mayne Pharma buried its bad news a long way back in its presentation to investors today but when shareholders caught on their reaction was sharp. The company's shares plunged more than 10 per cent after it revealed sales for a flagship suite of US generic drugs would not meet guidance. The news was buried on on page 107 of a 110-page oupdate released to coincide with an investor day the company was holding today. The company said in the investor update that tougher generic drug pricing was behind the revised guidance for the suite of drugs called the Teva portfolio. Mayne bought the portfolio of drugs from pharmaceutical giant Teva Pharmaceuticals last year for $845 million. The aquisition saw Mayne's first-half profit soar 278 per cent to $72.7 million in February. Mayne, which is worth more than $1.8 billion, re-affirmed its full-year profit guidance only a few weeks ago during its first half results in February. Chief executive Scott Richards said at the time that the outlook for the group "continues to be positive with significant growth opportunities from recent acquisitions, new product launches, further business development activities and transaction-related revenue and cost synergies." He said the generic product division would benefit in the second half from a full six-months' contribution from the Teva product acquisition. Mayne shares also dived in December on the back of a US price fixing lawsuit. The civil complaint filed by 20 US states accuses six companies – including Teva and Mayne – of conspiring to artificially inflate prices on an antibiotic and a diabetes drug.

The company's bad news was buried at the end of a 110-page update. Photo: Josh Robenstone Back to top 3:10pm on 1 May 2017 US House and Senate negotiators reached a tentative bipartisan deal on Sunday night (Monday AEDT) on a $US1.1 trillion bill to keep the government open until the end of September, according to Republican and Democratic aides. GOP leaders eager to focus on health care and tax overhauls bowed to Democratic demands to eliminate hundreds of policy restrictions aimed at curbing regulations from the bill, leaving the Trump administration with few victories. The White House sought funding to begin building the border wall, a well as $18 billion in cuts to domestic agencies, and both demands were rebuffed. The spending deal includes money for Planned Parenthood, despite Republican demands to defund the group over its provision of abortions. The deal's provisions were described by aides on condition of anonymity ahead of a formal announcement. President Donald Trump will be able to point to a $15 billion boost for the Pentagon, although $2.5 billion of that money is contingent on the administration delivering a new plan to fight Islamic State. Trump also will get a $1.5 billion for border security, but it can't be used for the border wall or additional Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, according to a congressional aide. There are also no new restrictions on money going to so-called sanctuary cities that don't fully enforce federal immigration laws. "This agreement is a good agreement for the American people, and takes the threat of a government shutdown off the table," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Sunday night in a statement. "The bill ensures taxpayer dollars aren't used to fund an ineffective border wall, excludes poison pill riders, and increases investments in programs that the middle-class relies on, like medical research, education, and infrastructure." Donald Trump will be able to point to a $15 billion boost for the Pentagon. Photo: AP 2:33pm on 1 May 2017 The backer of a Chinese joint-venture in advanced talks with Quintis to become its new preferred buyer in China is a former director of the Australian sandalwood grower. Graeme Scott has held board seats on Quintis' finance arm Arwon Finance, Quintis Forestry, Quintis Leasing and the parent Quintis, which was known as TFS at the time. Those directorships concluded in 2005 and 2006 and he remains a shareholder of the Perth-based group. Mr Scott is one of the parties behind a joint venture in China that is in negotiations with Quintis to become potentially its biggest buyer in China, following a disclosure in March that Quintis' largest buyer had yet to place an order this year amid a crackdown on duty avoidance by mainland importers. In an update on Monday, Quintis told shareholders that it struck an agreement with a mystery plantation investor at the eleventh hour to extend the life of a put option worth more than $30 million. The put, which if exercised forces Quintis to buy back immature sandalwood trees off the investor at a fixed price of previously $33.9 million, was due to expire on April 30. It is the second time it has been rolled over. Under the new terms, and "in light of the current corporate activity", it can be exercised between either July 10 to 14, or December 11 to 15 this year. If the investor exercises their option in the July window, the value of the contract is unchanged. If the investor elects to exercise in December, the value of the put increases by 6.25 per cent, a sweetener of 15 per cent on the equivalent annual rate. Quintis became a target of intense short selling when a contested research report published by US hedge fund Glaucus argued that Quintis shares were worth zero and likened the business to a Ponzi scheme, claims that the company consistently disputes. The subsequent fall in its share price was followed by the exit of its founder and chief executive Frank Wilson, who declared a plan to partner with a backer and take back the company. 1:57pm on 1 May 2017 In an up-and-down day the ASX is once again pushing higher, with fluctuating interest in the major lenders accounting for much of the action. The ASX 200 is up 17 points, or by 0.3 per cent, to 5941. As mentioned, the big four banks are the swing factor. After starting all higher, they copped some selling later in the morning but are now mixed.  Westpac and ANZ are up a touch, NAB is flat, while CBA is off 0.3 per cent. Rio and Fortescue are down, but BHP has climbed. South32 is down 2 per cent, Wesfarmers is recovering from its trading update last week, up 1.7 per cent, while Woolies is 0.3 per cent ahead. One of the worst performers is Mayne Pharma, down 10 per cent as it lowered it sales guidance in its Teva generic drugs business. 1:50pm on 1 May 2017 The flood of Israeli-based start-ups listing on the ASX is showing no signs of abating, with secure communications technology company Elsight the latest planning to go public on the exchange. The company is raising $6.5 million at 20¢ a share and a valuation of $18.17 million. It has met with a range of institutional investors and family offices on a roadshow in Australia this month. It joins the likes of Israeli firms Votiro Cybersec and CyberGym which are also listing on the ASX this year. Chief executive and co-founder Nir Gabay said the stock market in Israel was "weak", so firms had started looking for other options. "The next option was the NASDAQ, but you need to be a $1 billion company to list there, then you look at Hong Kong, but even then you need to be a $150 million company," he said. "But there is a good relationship between the ASX and Israel, so that was the best option for us." As part of the listing, Elsight has created a new Elsight Limited Australia company which will acquire the assets of Elsight Israel. The Israeli company is already profitable, having made a net profit of $US98,000 ($131,000) for the full year to December 31 and $US932,000 in revenue. Elsight's technology is designed for in-the-field communications and allows video and other data streams to be sent securely over multiple networks simultaneously, increasing bandwidth and allowing video to be streamed from the other side of the world in almost real time. It works by splitting the data into packages, encrypting these and then transmitting them via multiple sim cards, WiFi, LAN or radio networks and then reassembling it at the other end. The company was founded in 2009 by Mr Gabay and Roee Kashi, with the men having come from the Israeli special forces and military intelligence. Until recently Elsight had been prevented from selling internationally by the Israeli government. Elsight currently has customers in Israel, South Africa, Singapore, Vietnam and Malaysia. The capital raised through the listing will go towards research and development, as well as marketing, as it expands into other industries such as logistics, transport and media. Elsight co-founders Roee Kashi and Nir Gabay are taking the company public on the ASX. Photo: Paul Jeffers 1:17pm on 1 May 2017 "It always feels odd talking in 't's and 'trillions' not 'b's and 'billions'," Duncan Burns says. "But we never lose sight of the fact that its our clients' money and they have entrusted us to manage it."   The former Wall Street investment banker and hedge fund trader probably oversees more money than just about any portfolio manager in Australia, but he's an unlikely subject for a profile. If Burns has any views on the market, compelling stock tips or diatribes about the stupidity of central bankers and politicians, he's not willing to share them. Instead, Vanguard's head trader wants to talk about how he and his team invest and trade hundreds of billions of dollars trying to track the region's stock market indices at the lowest cost. Last year he said, his team traded $100 billion of stocks in the region. "If we can save one basis point through more efficient trading on that $100 billion, that's $10 million saved in investors' accounts, right where it belongs." The one dominant trend in funds management is how every day, billions of dollars are given up on trying to beat the market, and moving from active funds to lower-cost passive funds. Vanguard, by virtue of its ultra low costs, has captured much of this flow and has swelled its assets under management to $5.4 trillion, of which $2.9 trillion are tracking equity indices around the world. The portfolio managers and traders based in Melbourne are responsible for $93 billion of funds across the Asia-Pacific region. As Burns explains, they're some of the toughest and highest cost equity markets in the world and when the objective is to track the stock market at the lowest possible cost. It's a daily challenge. "Indexing is really simple to understand and implement. However, it requires a lot of behind-the-scenes work to execute well. "The benchmark indices are calculated without the frictional cost of transacting in the real world – so right out of the gate we are behind as an indexing community." Read more at the AFR.

RCG, which owns Hype DC, The Accent Group and The Athletes Foot, now expects underlying EBITDA for the year ending June to come in between $74 million and $80 million, compared with $60 million in 2016. RCG shares have plunged 19 per cent to 67¢ in early trade on Monday, taking losses since February to 50 per cent. RCG cut its guidance in February from $90 million to between $85 million and $88 million after like-for-like sales at Hype went backwards in the eight weeks after Christmas and sales growth slowed in the Accent division.  RCG's co-chief executive Hilton Brett said trading conditions had been challenging in the last two months, confirming anecdotal reports that discretionary spending had remained lacklustre since consumers snapped their handbags closed after Christmas. Mr Brett said like-for-like sales in the Accent Retail and Hype business in March and April were flat. Whilst this was an improvement on trading between Boxing Day and mid-February, when Hype like-for-like sales fell 2.8 per cent, sales had not met management's expectations. The Athlete's Foot failed to grow sales, despite gains at rival chains such as Super Retail Group's Rebel Sport, while same-store sales at RCG's vertical retail business had fallen 5 per cent since mid-February and wholesale sales were below expectations. The latest downgrade is likely to fuel fears that the athleisure trend has peaked after five years of strong growth. "The slowing sales that RCG is experiencing are in line with our view that the growth rates experienced by athleisure footwear will moderate as the cycle matures," Citigroup's small cap consumer analyst Sam Teeger said in a recent report. The struggles at RCG Group may have to do with the waning of the athleisure trend more broadly. Photo: BrettHemmings.com 12:37pm on 1 May 2017 Chinese gas distributor ENN and private equity firm Hony Capital now jointly hold a 12.81 per cent of embattled oil and gas group Santos after ENN revealedtoday that it was "acting in concert" with Hony. The move comes just days before the Santos annual general meeting scheduled to be held on Thursday. ENN, which is itself controlled by Chinese billionaire Wang Yusuo, became a big shareholder in Santos in March 2016 when it bought an 11.7 per cent stake, which had previously been held by Hony Capital. Hony bought up extra shares of its own accord in late 2016 and there has been much speculation in the market that the two had been working in unison. That has now been formalised by the Chinese duo, with the signing of an "Acting in Concert" agreement, which stretches for the next 24 months. There has been speculation from time to time about whether the Chinese firms may eventually seek more control of Santos. Hony originally became a shareholder in late 2015 when it took up a large chunk of shares in Santos as part of a share placement and equity raising. That capital raising and placement followed the rejection by the Santos board of a separate $7 billion takeover bid by an entity called Scepter Partners which was backed by the royal families of Brunei and the United Arab Emirates. ENN in late 2016 sent a letter to Santos chairman Peter Coates expressing annoyance at being denied a seat on the board after it pushed for a directorships because of its large holding. A substantial shareholder notice lodged with the ASX on Monday showed that ENN's stake in Santos was now 12.81 per cent, up from 11.82 per cent in the previous notice given by ENN to the ASX on May 2, 2016. Santos has been under the pump in the past week because Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is putting in place by July 1 a mechanism which will allow for the imposition of export controls to be placed on selected gas companies when there there is a shortfall of gas supply in the domestic market. Santos shares are 0.7 per cent lower at $3.46, and have plunged by more than a quarter of the past 12 months. Chinese gas distributor ENN now holds 12.81 per cent of Santos. Photo: Supplied 11:51am on 1 May 2017 Prices in Sydney and Melbourne slowed in April mainly due to falls in apartment prices, but more data is needed before a cooling is confirmed, CoreLogic said in its April Hedonic Home Value Index. There was no increase in Sydney's overall house price in April while Melbourne's house price rose a small 0.5 per cent. Canberra posted the largest fall in prices among the capital cities of 2.8 per cent.  "The two hottest housing markets in the nation have shown signs of slowing down in April, with the CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index recording a rise of just 0.1 per cent over April, the lowest month-on-month rise in capital city dwelling values since December 2015," head of research Tim Lawless said. "The moderation in growth was due largely to a slightly negative April result in Australia's largest capital city housing market, Sydney, where dwelling values were broadly flat over the month." "The market is slowing down but we need to see a few more months before we make a a conclusion that the market has peaked. It's [still] coming down from such a high base." "We need to be cautious in calling a peak in the market after only one month of soft results. April, in particular, coincides with seasonal factors including Easter, school holidays and ANZAC day long weekend." Mr Lawless classified the fall in prices in Canberra and even a rise in prices in Darwin as "noise". But the impact of APRA's tightening on investor loans should not be disregarded although property agents said the impact of cooling measures would take time and over several months. "The softer results should also be viewed against a backdrop of an ever evolving regulatory landscape s which is firmly aimed at slowing investment and interest-only mortgage lending," Mr Lawless added. "Testament to this is mortgage rates which have been edging higher, particularly for investors and interest-only loans, as well as rental yields which have been hovering around record lows. The higher cost of debt, as well as stricter lending and servicing criteria, has likely dented investment demand over recent months." Sydney house prices have risen more than 70 per cent since 2012, but there has been a slowdown in April.  Photo: Wolter Peeters 11:30am on 1 May 2017 Photo: The Wall Street Journal A year ago, many investors had given up on Apple, whose stock price had fallen more than 30 per cent from its 2015 peak. Apple's once-unstoppable growth had come to a crashing halt: the number of iPhones sold was down 13 per cent, and the company posted its first revenue decline in 13 years. Today, Apple's business remains sluggish, but that hasn't stopped investors, including the famously tech-averse Warren Buffett, from falling in love with it again. Shares of the tech giant - the most valuable company in the United States by market value - have repeatedly hit new highs this year. On Friday, they closed at $US143.65, up nearly 60 per cent from last May's trough. What's driving the stock, say sceptics and fans alike, is hope - hope that the new iPhones due in September, after the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone's introduction, will be dazzling enough to inspire existing iPhone users to upgrade and prompt others to switch from Android phones made by Samsung, Huawei and other manufacturers. "Everyone expects Apple to cure cancer with their next product launch," said Kevin Landis, chief executive of Firsthand Funds, who has managed tech-focused mutual funds through many ups and downs. Investors will get more data about Apple's performance, and perhaps some clues about its future, on Tuesday (US time), when the company reports its results for the financial quarter that ended in March. Analysts expect the company to report a slight increase in iPhone sales and overall revenue. Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal says Apple is expected to report that its stockpile of cash has topped a quarter of a trillion [US] dollars, an unrivaled corporate hoard that is greater than the market value of both Wal-Mart and Procter & Gamble and exceeds the combined foreign-currency reserves held by the UK and Canada combined. Apple is expected to make more updates in its next high-end iPhone, including a high-resolution screen that covers the phone's entire face. But the company has also suggested that much of its future growth will come from services like Apple Music, Apple Pay and the cut that Apple takes from application sales and subscriptions in the app store.

Despite uncertainly around foreign investment rules, Chinese companies pumped $15.4 billion into Australian deals last year with commercial property, infrastructure and agriculture the most popular. Now in its sixth year the report, Demystifying Chinese Investment in Australia, found that mining, once the backbone of the investment relationship, had dropped to sixth place with deals worth $839 million last year, down 35 per cent from 2015.  Co-author of the report, Doug Ferguson from KPMG, said Australia's investment relationship with China continued to diversity with a record number of deals in 2016, while more of these than ever before were done by private companies. Just under half the value of Chinese investment in Australia last year was conducted by private companies, although many of these would have received financing from state-owned banks and retained strong links to Beijing. "Despite the impact of uncertainties about Australia's foreign investment review regime, Chinese investment ... continued to diversity and records were smashed," said Mr Ferguson. He said Chinese investment in Australia was starting to "mature" and that parties from the mainland accepted they often needed to form local joint ventures and take minority stakes for high profile deals. This attitude saw property develop Shanghai CRED team-up with Gina Reinehart and accept a minority stake in the purchase of the Kidman cattle empire. But while Australia retains its second place behind the United States in the aggregate value of Chinese investment since 2007, another of the report's co-authors warns that others were catching up. While forecasting strong outbound investment over the longer term, the reported noted efforts by Beijing to moderate capital outflows to keep the yuan relatively strong may impact deals this year. "Real estate, hotels, films, entertainment and sports clubs are among the industries singled out as exhibiting a tendency for 'irrational' overseas investments," the report said. "This is expected to impact investment flows to these sectors in the future." Chinese investment in Australia is at its highest point since the 2008 global financial crisis, according to a new report. Photo: Rolex Dela Pena Back to top 10:33am on 1 May 2017 Shares have shaken off a soft overseas lead to open firmly higher in early trade as investors bet on solid bank results amid a broad uplift. The ASX 200 is up 21 points or 0.3 per cent at 5945 points. Investors are still happy to push banks higher ahead of earnings numbers, Westpac up 0.4 per cent, while ANZ and CBA have added 0.3 per cent. NAB is only marginally higher, while Macquarie continues to push towards its pre-GFC highs, adding another 1.3 per cent. Gains in Woolies, Wesfarmers, Tesltra and CSL are all bolstering the index as it climbs towards 6000 points. Mining and energy stocks are the drags, with BHP off 0.2 per cent, Rio down 0.3 per cent and Rio 1.2 per cent despite Friday night's strong increase in spot iron ore prices. Yesterday's weaker than expected Chinese factory activity indicator may have had something to do with the weakness for the sector. South32 is down 0.5 per cent. In energy, Origin's 1 per cent drop, Santos's 0.7 per cent loss and Oil Search's 0.6 per cent is weighing against the morning's gains. Among the morning's biggest movers is Platinum Asset Mgt, which has dropped 4.4 per cent, while gold miners feature strongly in the best performers. Winners and losers in the ASX 200 this morning. Photo: Bloomberg 10:07am on 1 May 2017 The combined profits of Australia's big four banks likely exceeded $15 billion in the first half, as lenders started to benefit from a round of late 2016 interest rate hikes and strong home loan growth. Big four investors have enjoyed share price gains of more than 6 per cent so far this year, and half-year results from three of the big four in the coming weeks are expected to show profits also ground higher across the industry. Even so, there remains a question mark about whether NAB and Westpac can sustain their dividends, as the industry prepares for looming rules that may force lenders to set aside billions more in capital. ANZ will kick off the half-year bank reporting season tomorrow, with analysts tipping a $3.5 billion cash profit in the six months to March, and a flat interim dividend of 80¢ a share. NAB on Thursday is tipped to deliver earnings of $3.25 billion and also keep its dividend flat. Macquarie Group, whose share price last week closed at $93, not far off its 2007 record high of $97.10, is tipped to deliver a full-year profit of more than $2.1 billion on Friday. That would exceed last year's record of $2.06 billion for the investment bank, which will be among the biggest local winners from promised company tax cuts in the United States. Next week, Westpac's profits are expected to exceed $4 billion and CBA, which reports on June financial year, will post a quarterly update, after it notched up half-year profits of $4.84 billion in February. Profits have likely grown across the industry on the back of housing credit growth of 6.5 per cent in the last six months, analysts believe, propelled by higher house prices in Melbourne and Sydney. There are few signs of distress in banks' loan books, and a round of interest rate hikes targeted at property investors in late 2016 may have also helped earnings. "We expect near-term earnings to be well supported by mortgage repricing benefits, investor-led credit growth, benign credit environment and solid trading income," said Macquarie analyst Victor German.

"The Vix has plummeted below 11, just as we see the big drivers of the rally beginning to lose steam. Indeed, our derivatives strategy team recently noted that several asset classes were pricing a 'world almost free of risk'," a Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategist said in a note late last week. One of your Eds wrote on the topic over the weekend: After years of falling interest rates and central bank support investors have become comfortable buying high and selling higher. Perhaps it's a new bubble: in complacency. What will pop it is anyone's guess. Investors are quick to shrug off worries – France is so last week – and are prepared to buy high in order to sell higher. This is classic bullish behaviour. No surprise there; we are, after all, in a global bull market. Apparently there is no obvious reason for investors to make any dramatic portfolio decisions. Sure, equities are pricey, as are most assets after years of falling rates and central bank bond-buying. But the European Union is not about to break up now that we've decided Le Pen has no chance of winning the second round of French voting. And the global growth upswing is still looking solid. Meanwhile Reuters numbers tell us that listed US companies are having their best quarter of profits since 2011. A global fund manager recently told me that his biggest worry, at least over the short term, was the potential for a big policy mistake in China. The Chinese government has plenty of levers it can pull to maintain growth and stability. The real concern, this fundie said, is that it will pull the wrong ones, or perhaps the right one at the wrong time. That said, a slump on the Shanghai bourse in recent weeks has barely registered globally, despite the falls being driven by a regulatory crackdown on leverage in the Chinese sharemarket. Granted the losses in mainland Chinese shares are not too dramatic, but they have been out of step with the rest of the emerging world, as well as the pro-risk mood more broadly. It suggests investors are not as worried as they were in late 2015 and into 2016 when ham-handed policy interventions sparked a massive wave of anxiety across global markets.

Investors are apparently not worried about anything much, according to the VIX.  9:44am on 1 May 2017 SPONSORED POST There's something for everyone in markets this week, writes IG strategist Chris Weston: The ASX 200 financial sub-sector needs to hold and build on its break of 7000 and from here make an assault on the 2015 highs which is a mere 2.8% away. Interestingly, the all-time high for the sub-index (from 2007) sits 7.8% away, which seems far more attainable than the broader ASX 200, which needs to appreciate 15.6% to print a new all-time high. The idea of "sell in May and go away" is certainly being talked about, but let's not forget last May the ASX 200 gained 2.4% and despite the average loss over the past decade being 1.6%, most of that can be explained by poor monthly performances in the years between 2010 and 2013. June is actually a far worse month historically to be holding ASX 200 exposure, falling 2.2% on average. We have central bank meetings from the RBA, the Federal Reserve and for FX traders one can also look at the Norges Bank. We have the Fed funds futures pricing at 64% chance of a June hike (from the Federal Reserve), but that pricing mechanism could also easily change given we have pretty much key piece of US economic data being released. Here we see ISM manufacturing (tonight at midnight), core PCE, vehicle sales, services ISM and non-farm payrolls on Friday (consensus 190,000 jobs). We also have the small affair of the French presidential elections on Sunday, and while many see this as a fait accompli, some are showing concern that Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, a first round candidate, has formally endorsed Marine Le Pen and this may provide her with a few extra votes. The market doesn't seem too concerned by this though and still see a fairly comfortable victory for Macron, with implied volatility still subdued and EUR/USD nicely supported into $1.0850. Read more. Play Video Replay Video Will bank earnings drive the ASX 200 towards 6000? With ANZ, NAB, MQG and WBC all reporting earnings in the days ahead, will the numbers and outlook breathe further life into a sector that is clearly outperforming. (This video was produced in commercial partnership between Fairfax Media and IG Markets). 9:37am on 1 May 2017 Photo: CBA Growth in China's manufacturing sector slowed faster than expected in April, an official survey showed on Sunday, as producer price rises lost steam and authorities moved to tackle risks in the property market and credit growth. The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 51.2 in April from the previous month's 51.8, which was the strongest reading since April 2012. Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted a reading of 51.6, the ninth straight month above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. Growth in China's services sector slowed slightly to 54.0 in April, compared with the previous month's reading of 55.1, which was the highest since May 2014. Despite the lower PMI figure, the "drivers of industrial recovery remain intact", CBA China and Asia economist Wei Li said. "We expect industrial production growth to register 6.9 per cent year-on-year in April, compared with an average growth rate of 6.8 per cent in Q1," Li wrote. China's economy grew a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent in the first quarter, boosted by higher government infrastructure spending and a gravity-defying property boom. Chinese leaders have pledged to shift the emphasis to addressing financial risks and asset bubbles, which analysts say pose a threat to the world's second-largest economy if not handed well. President Xi Jinping last week called for increased efforts to ward off systemic risks to help maintain financial security, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Some analysts believe China's economic growth may have peaked in the first quarter but that it's on track to hit a target of around 6.5 per cent this year. CBA's Li is more bullish, forecasting the country's GDP to expand by 6.8 per cent in 2017 - the same pace as last year. China's producer price inflation cooled for the first time in seven months in March as iron ore and coal prices tumbled, while property sales growth slowed in the first quarter despite robust property investment.

The confident safety, who entered the draft after three seasons at LSU, already had plans for his first check as well: "This one right here, I am not spending. My first NFL check is going straight to Chase Bank."  Complex spoke with Adams in Philly just before that big night as he was getting glammed up in the Procter & Gamble VIP Style Lounge. While getting a haircut and, yes, a pedicure, he told us he hoped that whatever team drafted him would also be a good basketball city—that obviously didn't work out. But he also discussed his admiration for the NBA's notoriously fashionable Russell Westbrook, what it's like seeing his name on ESPN, and actually, the questions he'd rather be answering.   A post shared by Jamal Adams (@presidentmal__) on Apr 28, 2017 at 10:41am PDT I saw you tweet shortly after the Combine that you want people to stop comparing you. What names were they throwing around? A lot of people were comparing me to other draftees; that was who that was mainly for, if I remember. But yeah, I don’t like to be compared with other guys, especially if you don’t know football. It’s one thing to just watch film, but if you know the game, and know the ins and outs, you can break things down…’cause a lot of people just break things down by stats—how many picks you have, you’re a better DB—no, that’s not true. Speaking of picks, is that your main goal when you’re on the field, racking up INTs? So my sophomore year I had two picks, dropped two, and then my junior year I had one pick, all the way up until the Bama game. So it taught me a lot of patience, it taught me to let the game come to you because if you rush the game, you’re not going to make the plays. In the Wisconsin game, I dropped a pick, the ball hit the ground, and it was tough. You realize that you have to sit back and just let the game just come. If you’re out there saying, “I need to get a pick, I need to get a pick,” sometimes it just doesn’t work out that way. I feel like everything happens for a reason. Ended with five picks. Not what I wanted, but I think it’s fine. So you’re aiming to best those numbers when you hit the league. Oh most definitely, you definitely wanna get picks in the league. Like looking at it, it honestly feels like in the league you can get more picks, ‘cause—to me—it looks like a lot of quarterbacks just throw it up. In college, it’s hard. But we’ll see. I’m probably wrong. I probably am, like 99 percent [chance], but at the same time, I’m just looking forward to it. Was there a moment as a kid when you realized, “Oh wow, my dad is a big deal?” Not really. I’ve always just been chill on it. He’s really chill, too. I don’t really feel like he feels the big deal either. His career was cut short. He was the 19th pick, and he could have done outstanding things, but it was cut short. But he’s very grateful for the opportunity, he met a lot of people throughout the process, and he just said, “Don’t take it for granted” because he wished he could be back out there doing what he loved to do. I know this time in your life is incredibly hectic, but have you gotten a chance to watch any of the NBA Playoffs? A little bit. My favorite player is Dwyane Wade. I’ve always been a fan of Dwyane Wade, since the Marquette days. But I’m also a fan of Westbrook. I love his intensity. I love how he comes to the game with that mindset and how he’s himself with the fashion—I’m into the fashion world too, so I love what he does. But I’ve only caught maybe one game. I don’t like to catch it until it gets really good. I don’t know if I’ll have any free time here pretty soon, but whatever team I go to, hopefully it’s a city where I can go to the basketball games too. That would be pretty cool. Westbrook, huh? OK. Describe your personal fashion sense. I think my style is really laid-back, very classy, but I like to have pop. I’m not a flashy guy, but I like to have a little pop. Image via Procter & Gamble You also happen to have great hair. Tell us about this partnership with Head & Shoulders. It’s outstanding that I’m part of the family with Head & Shoulders. They’re definitely a class act. It’s definitely an exciting time for my family and I to get started with that brand. It speaks volumes that things are going in the right direction, things that I want are finally here, so it’s an exciting time. Odell Beckham Jr., an LSU alum like yourself, is also a member of the Head & Shoulders family. Have you thought about what it would be like to play with him or against him? It’s crazy—I saw him at the LSU Spring Game last week. We don’t really talk about it, but it’s surreal how everything came so fast. We saw him go off as a rookie, as soon as I came in [to LSU], and he did outstanding, as everybody knows, and hopefully I can just be there one day doing some of the things he’s doing. When did you realize, “Oh shit, all eyes are on me”? Probably my sophomore year. Stared to make plays, and then there was speculation already that I was coming out my junior year. That was kinda crazy, seeing your name on the ticker on ESPN. A lot of people be like, “Do you look at it?” Yeah, of course, you see your name on ESPN when you turn the TV on, of course you gon’ look at it, even though it’s poison at times to a lot of people, but it’s ways you handle it. How do you handle it? It’s only going to get worse. For instance, it was an Uber driver, a young lady yesterday was like, “Who are you?” And I was like, “I’m a regular person, my name is Jamal Adams.” I like to be known as regular, I don’t like to be known as “Oh, this is a celeb.” I feel like everybody is the same. Everybody just has different backgrounds. I just say stay true to yourself; you’re not better than anyone, everybody’s the same but just different ways of living life. Last thing: What question are you tired of answering? [Laughs.] Really just repetitive questions There was one guy who asked me about my father, like, “Have you ever seen his Super Bowl ring?” Of course I’ve seen his Super Bowl ring. You know, “What’s it like?” That question gets old, but at the end of the day it’s a process, and I answer it. And on the flip side, what do you wish people would ask? My coverage ability, a lot of people don’t talk about my coverage ability. I feel like I am the best safety covering-wise. Oh—and my why. Why I’m doing this. People don’t ask about my motivation, my why.        WatchNow Tags: Features, Interviews, Football, LSU, LSU Tigers, New York Jets, NFL Draft, NFL, Jamal Adams  Like  Follow  Chat Show Comments Lateststories The Warriors Wished the Clippers Beat the Jazz in Game 7 Because 'There's No Nightlife in Utah' BY Gavin Evans 9 hours ago Ruthless Red Sox Fans Chant 'She Said No!'

(Photo: David Guralnick, Detroit News) 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Michigan tight end Jake Butt, who is well aware his last name makes him the …well … butt of many jokes, finally heard his name called at the NFL draft. Butt might have been taken in the first three rounds had he not suffered torn knee ligaments in the Orange Bowl. Instead, he lasted until the first pick of the fifth round before the Broncos drafted him. Butt actually made money by falling in the draft. He took out an insurance policy that paid him $10,000 for each pick he dropped below the middle of the third round. According to ESPN, Butt will receive $543,000 tax free because of his draft-day tumble. The policy would have paid a maximum of $2 million based on how far he slipped. Asked about the insurance policy Saturday, Butt said: “There’s a lot more going into that than what’s being tweeted out. ... There’s so much more that will go into it than I understand right now.” Butt has been teased most of his life about his last name, yet has had plenty of fun with it nonetheless. Last week, he even posed for a picture beside a Charmin dump truck that deposited several rolls of toilet paper next to him. It’s uncertain whether he has agreed to a commercial endorsement with Proctor and Gamble, which manufactures Charmin. “I love it so much,” Butt said in an interview with ESPN regarding the jokes made about his name. “I think that’s one of my greatest traits. It has really allowed me to grow my platform and build my brand.” Butt is serious about his game, though. He’s more anxious to make a name for himself with his play in the NFL than in the world of double entendre. The 6-foot-6, 250-pound tight end finished his four-year career at Michigan with 138 catches for 1,646 yards and 11 touchdowns. “We were holding our breath these last few picks hoping to get Michigan TE Jake Butt. A top-notch TE, we’re fortunate to select him in the fifth,” Broncos general manager John Elway wrote on Twitter. The 2016 Mackey Award winner for the best tight end in the nation, Butt suffered a second torn ACL in the Orange Bowl. The subsequent surgery prohibited him from showing teams what he could do. Prior to Butt’s injury, he was projected to be picked near the top of the second round, which would have grossed about $4 million in guaranteed money. As the first pick in the fifth round, Butt will receive about $380,000 in guaranteed money. 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE TOP VIDEOS Tigers' Daniel Norris on win against Indians 0:44 Tigers' Victor Martinez on his first career bunt single 1:28 UM sings 'The Victors' to end spring practice 0:54 Rogers and Niyo break down Day 3 of the NFL draft 12:02 Tigers' Justin Wilson on the bullpen 0:42 Tigers' Victor Martinez on battling in the batter's box 2:28 Brad Ausmus on loss to White Sox 1:17 Harbaugh kids with Michigan team 1:07 Jim Harbaugh: 'We feel like pioneers' 1:33 Jim Harbaugh on overseas game 0:52

More than 230 people sought refuge from the storms Sunday night in 25 shelters across six states. There have been as many as 10 reported fatalities, although that figure is expected to rise. "This month is historically the peak month for tornadoes, so it's critical that people stay informed and get prepared," said Brad Kieserman, vice president of Disaster Operations and Logistics for the Red Cross. "Our first priority is providing shelter, so that those affected have a safe place to stay. As more severe weather is expected for this coming weekend, the Red Cross will go where we're needed for as long as we're needed. When conditions improve, we will then help people in their first steps on the path to recovery." In Missouri, some communities were forced to evacuate due to rising rivers, and more evacuations could occur today. Red Cross disaster workers have opened numerous shelters where more than 130 people spent Sunday night. Flooding also hit central and southern Illinois, so the Red Cross is also helping in that area. The Red Cross also has shelters open in Arkansas, where the governor declared a state of emergency after residents in Sharp and Fulton counties were forced to leave their homes due to river flooding. In Oklahoma, Red Cross disaster workers opened shelters after the governor declared a state of emergency due to severe storms, flooding and snow affecting a large part of the state. Tornadoes ripped apart parts of Texas, where as many as 5,000 buildings may be affected. And in Kansas, a major snowstorm dumped more than a foot of snow. The Red Cross has shelters open in both states. Meanwhile, the Red Cross also responded to the shooting situation at an apartment complex in San Diego, California, providing housing and canteen services to almost 50 displaced individuals. DOWNLOAD EMERGENCY APP  People should download the free Red Cross Emergency App to receive emergency alerts and information about what to do in case of tornadoes, flooding and other disasters, as well as locations of shelters. The App also includes emergency first aid information and a Family Safe feature which allows people to instantly see if loved ones are okay. The free Emergency App is available in app stores by searching for the American Red Cross or going to redcross.org/apps.

I am so tired of that question.” To catch you up to speed, Adidas had promised a private island to any prospect who broke the 40-yard dash record. Ross did that with a time of 4.22, but he was ineligible for the lavish prize since he was wearing Nike cleats. Is it any surprise that brand returned the loyalty by selecting Ross for its Nike Football rookie class of 2017?  After he was drafted ninth overall by the Cincinnati Bengals, he offered a better narrative to run with (pun intended): “I’m honestly a better person than I am a player.” That will be something to see, considering Ross played receiver and corner at Washington, rebounded from a torn ACL that caused him to miss an entire season, and set a school-record for kickoff returns for a TD. Ross’s new career is beginning before his current one has even ended. On June 10 he’ll graduate with a degree in American ethnic studies, a major that satisfies his curiosity about different cultures. Ross says understanding the anthropological shifts as America becomes more diverse might help him when he gets into coaching down the road. Safe to say he stays on the move, mentally and physically. In our interview, he also shared the topic he thinks he’s the GOAT in, the R&B singer who’s like a big brother to him, and how his injury actually made him a better athlete. From my research, I learned that you’re friends with Trey Songz. How did that come about? How did you find that out? That’s crazy. Somebody who rolls around with him is from the area that I’m from, and he’s actually really good friends with my dad—they’re like brothers. ‘Cause Trey Songz is not that young. Not saying he’s old! He’d be mad if he heard me say that, but he’s a little older. My dad’s 39, I think Trey is like 32. So they all know each other. And Trey’s been my favorite artist since like sixth, seventh grade, so just for me to meet him was really special. And you guys just kept in touch? Yeah. So every time I’m back in California I go and hang out with him, go to the studio, hear some music. And he works hard too. I like being around him because he’s one of the guys who will keep you focused. Has he given you advice? Yeah, definitely. We FaceTime, and after I ran he told me, “Now everybody’s after you. Just stay focused, and stay humble; that’s the biggest part." That was one of my questions: How did things change for you after you broke the record at the Combine? They didn’t change so much. I think people have noticed me more for being fast. They didn’t think I was as fast as people were saying, but now they know. Image via USA Today Sports/Sam Greene What’s your relationship like with [projected No. 1 NBA draft pick] Marquelle Fultz? Actually, me and Marquelle, we had like two different paths—he’s basketball, I’m football. So I barely see Marquelle on campus, maybe because of the setup. We practice early in the morning, they practice later in the day. But every time me and Marquelle see each other it’s nothing but love. We always talk, say what’s up, how you doing. He’s quiet too, and I like that. He’s a humble dude. He doesn’t come off like, “I’m the No. 1 draft pick.” He’s not a flashy guy; he’s very respectable. So you had a school-record four kickoff returns for a touchdown, which is crazy. Do you expect to be utilized on special teams? They asked me would I want to do that, and I said yeah. But they kind of told me it’s a little different. Guys are now kicking it out the endzone, so we talked about punt return, which I’m very open to, which I’ve always wanted to do. I kind of got away from it because we had another guy come in who was just really good, and they didn’t want me doing kick return, punt return, receiver, and I was playing corner, so I was doing so much. You did the most. [Laughs.] Yeah, I was a little extra, but I definitely want to do special teams in the league because it will not only help me, it’ll help the team, which is the most important part. You crammed a lot into your collegiate career. Like you said, you played corner, receiver, and you had an injury. Well, I love this game, so it wasn’t really that hard of a transition. The hardest part was finding out I was not playing for a whole season before it even started. It hurt me. But once you realize all the positives you get out of that, you’re almost thankful. Not almost—you are thankful. I got to see my family more, I got to focus more on school, I started to be on the Dean’s List. And really I got to learn football from a different perspective—a coach’s perspective—and really hone in on my position and the playbook, talk to my quarterback, see what he was thinking: Why’d you throw that and not this? So it was a little different. Now that I got to see all that I can honestly say it was a blessing in disguise, and that whole theory of things happen for a reason…it’s funny how we work as humans; we gotta see it to believe it, but that’s actually true. What, if anything, are you going to miss about school? I think school is school. I don’t think too many people miss school, [laughs] whether you were the best student ever or not, because school is a grind. It takes so much of your time. I’ll miss the brotherhood, the quality time you get to spend with your teammates. Guys tell me now how the older guys [on the team] have kids, they have families, more responsibilities. They don’t have time to come over, kick it, play the game, watch the game, so it’s a little different. Image via Getty/Lisa Lake Speaking of playing the game, what’s your go to? I’m a Call of Duty guy. Love it. Call of Duty 2K. I’m the best. That’s the only thing I’m cocky about in this world. I’m the GOAT. And we are in the Procter & Gamble VIP Style Lounge. So how did you decide to partner with Old Spice? Old Spice has great product. As I’m getting ready, I’m using the Hydro Wash and it keeps me smelling fresh, it has my skin hydrated even after a workout, so it’s easy. They have the hardest working collection, so for me to be a part of it is very nice. They also have really weird commercials. Are you ready to be a part of that? Yeah, I think weird commercials are attractive. People laugh at them and it makes you pay attention. You’ll never forget that ad. People will walk around like, “You see that weird Old Spice commercial?” Some ads don’t even get talked about, so Old Spice is doing a great job with that. Do you have any hair or grooming superstitions? I did, I’m not gon lie. I felt like if I played with my hair not braided, I didn’t play as well, or if I wore a certain brand of socks then I gotta wear that brand of socks in the game. If I practiced the whole week and did good, I’m like, if I wear black socks now I won’t do that good. Is there a particular player you’re really looking forward to playing with or against? I really wanna play against Patrick Peterson, Aqib Talib. These guys are great guys. Great position guys. Their competitiveness, their talent, I like the dog that they bring. And I think it’s always good to play against somebody who got that dog in them, just to challenge yourself—how hard are you working? How hard are you willing to go play against guys who are that good? As a wide receiver, how did it feel to see Dez Bryant follow you on Instagram? I did not see that! I’m glad you said that. I’m also a fan of Dez, his hard work and his dedication and how much work he’s put in, definitely a fan, so I appreciate you telling me that. Now I gotta go follow him back! What are your favorite social media accounts? Kevin Hart, because he’s always posting something foolish. I love comedy. Also The Shiggy Show on Instagram. He’s super funny. I mostly follow funny accounts. A lot of athletes we just post pictures and stuff and try to inspire from afar, so yeah, I like comedy pages. And what's going on in your DMs? It’s a lot of kids in my DMs asking me to follow them, asking for shoutouts, posting me in their Snapchat stories. I started to do that sometimes so now the kids just be blowing me up. And I respond to some of ‘em, sometimes. I love kids. You said after your name was called that you were more excited for your family than yourself. Why is that? I used to watch this on TV. Now that I’m here, I couldn’t feel any more special. My mom calls me crying, I’m like, “What happened?” She’s like, “I’m just so excited I can’t sleep.” So I just appreciate stuff like that.         WatchNow Tags: Features, Interviews, Cincinnati Bengals, NFL Draft, NFL, Cincinnati, John Ross  Like  Follow  Chat Show Comments Lateststories The Warriors Wished the Clippers Beat the Jazz in Game 7 Because 'There's No Nightlife in Utah' BY Gavin Evans 9 hours ago Ruthless Red Sox Fans Chant 'She Said No!'

Tornadoes News provided by American Red Cross 01 May, 2017, 13:20 ET Share this article WASHINGTON, May 1, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The American Red Cross is on the ground across six states, helping people affected by record severe storms, flooding and tornadoes which hit the southern Plains and Mississippi Valley regions. More than 230 people sought refuge from the storms Sunday night in 25 shelters across six states. There have been as many as 10 reported fatalities, although that figure is expected to rise. "This month is historically the peak month for tornadoes, so it's critical that people stay informed and get prepared," said Brad Kieserman, vice president of Disaster Operations and Logistics for the Red Cross. "Our first priority is providing shelter, so that those affected have a safe place to stay. As more severe weather is expected for this coming weekend, the Red Cross will go where we're needed for as long as we're needed. When conditions improve, we will then help people in their first steps on the path to recovery." American Red Cross volunteer Bailey Moir surveys the damage in her hometown of Canton, TX after tornadoes swept through this past weekend. Moir watches as people sort through their belongings in the rubble, knowing she is headed next to help her father do the same at his home nearby. In Missouri, some communities were forced to evacuate due to rising rivers, and more evacuations could occur today. Red Cross disaster workers have opened numerous shelters where more than 130 people spent Sunday night. Flooding also hit central and southern Illinois, so the Red Cross is also helping in that area. The Red Cross also has shelters open in Arkansas, where the governor declared a state of emergency after residents in Sharp and Fulton counties were forced to leave their homes due to river flooding. In Oklahoma, Red Cross disaster workers opened shelters after the governor declared a state of emergency due to severe storms, flooding and snow affecting a large part of the state. Tornadoes ripped apart parts of Texas, where as many as 5,000 buildings may be affected. And in Kansas, a major snowstorm dumped more than a foot of snow. The Red Cross has shelters open in both states. Meanwhile, the Red Cross also responded to the shooting situation at an apartment complex in San Diego, California, providing housing and canteen services to almost 50 displaced individuals. DOWNLOAD EMERGENCY APP People should download the free Red Cross Emergency App to receive emergency alerts and information about what to do in case of tornadoes, flooding and other disasters, as well as locations of shelters. The App also includes emergency first aid information and a Family Safe feature which allows people to instantly see if loved ones are okay. The free Emergency App is available in app stores by searching for the American Red Cross or going to redcross.org/apps.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Red Cross Responds to Deadly Severe Weather Across Six States Deadliest Start to Tornado Season in 9 Years; May is Peak Month for Tornadoes WASHINGTON, May 1, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The American Red Cross is on the ground across six states, helping people affected by record severe storms, flooding and tornadoes which hit the southern Plains and Mississippi Valley regions. More than 230 people sought refuge from the storms Sunday night in 25 shelters across six states. There have been as many as 10 reported fatalities, although that figure is expected to rise. "This month is historically the peak month for tornadoes, so it's critical that people stay informed and get prepared," said Brad Kieserman, vice president of Disaster Operations and Logistics for the Red Cross. "Our first priority is providing shelter, so that those affected have a safe place to stay. As more severe weather is expected for this coming weekend, the Red Cross will go where we're needed for as long as we're needed. When conditions improve, we will then help people in their first steps on the path to recovery." In Missouri, some communities were forced to evacuate due to rising rivers, and more evacuations could occur today. Red Cross disaster workers have opened numerous shelters where more than 130 people spent Sunday night. Flooding also hit central and southern Illinois, so the Red Cross is also helping in that area. The Red Cross also has shelters open in Arkansas, where the governor declared a state of emergency after residents in Sharp and Fulton counties were forced to leave their homes due to river flooding. In Oklahoma, Red Cross disaster workers opened shelters after the governor declared a state of emergency due to severe storms, flooding and snow affecting a large part of the state. Tornadoes ripped apart parts of Texas, where as many as 5,000 buildings may be affected. And in Kansas, a major snowstorm dumped more than a foot of snow. The Red Cross has shelters open in both states. Meanwhile, the Red Cross also responded to the shooting situation at an apartment complex in San Diego, California, providing housing and canteen services to almost 50 displaced individuals. DOWNLOAD EMERGENCY APP People should download the free Red Cross Emergency App to receive emergency alerts and information about what to do in case of tornadoes, flooding and other disasters, as well as locations of shelters. The App also includes emergency first aid information and a Family Safe feature which allows people to instantly see if loved ones are okay. The free Emergency App is available in app stores by searching for the American Red Cross or going to redcross.org/apps.

Apple had a little more than $240 billion as of the end of December. By Paul R. La Monica NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- When Apple releases its earnings on Tuesday, tech junkies will be looking for clues about the next iPhone and any mention of other new products. Will the new iPhone be called the 8? The 10 or X in honor of its tenth anniversary? Will it come in red? But Wall Street will be watching something else even more closely -- Apple's growing pile of cash. It is likely Apple will report more than a quarter of a trillion dollars in cash and investments on its balance sheet for the first time ever. Apple had a little more than $240 billion as of the end of December. Apple's stack of Franklins, Grants and Jacksons has steadily grown over the past few years. Five years ago, Apple had "just" $110.2 billion in cash. And Apple has increasingly stashed away its cash overseas for tax purposes. Apple CFO Luca Maestri said in February that $230 billion of its cash was held abroad. But there are growing hopes that Apple might soon be able to bring back, or repatriate, this cash to the United States at a one-time lower tax rate if President Trump is able to get his tax plan through Congress. Apple could use the cash to hire more workers, build more plants, make acquisitions, repurchase stock and boost its dividend. Some argue that if Apple and other tech giants were allowed to bring back cash to the U.S., it could stimulate the entire economy. To put into context just how much money $250 billion really is, consider the following. Apple's cash, if it were its own company, would be the 12th largest firm in the S&P 500. Besides Apple, Google owner Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and General Electric have market valuations higher than $250 billion. And Apple's cash is worth only slightly less than all of GE. It's also worth more than well-known blue chips AT&T, Walmart, Home Depot, Coca-Cola and Disney. (AT&T is in the process of acquiring CNNMoney owner Time Warner. By the way, Apple's cash is worth more than three times Time Warner's market value.) Apple's pot of gold, so to speak, is also worth more than Bank of America, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, Visa, Verizon and Comcast. Want more mind-boggling comparisons? $250 billion in cash is about 10 times the market value of Snapchat parent Snap. It is 3.5 times the valuation of Uber, and 20 times that of Twitter. It's also nearly 50 times the market cap of BlackBerry, the former king of mobile phones and a company that has arguably become mostly obsolete in large part due to Apple and the smartphone revolution it helped create.

Published on May 01, 2017. Ad Age "Media Guy" columnist Simon Dumenco's media roundup for the morning of Monday, May 1: Let's start with a flashback: President Trump told the Associated Press last week that he thinks he could build his border wall "for $10 billion or less." Earlier flashback: "Trump border wall to cost $21.6 billion," per Reuter's February peek at a Department of Homeland Security internal report. Very recent flashback (to yesterday): Congress ponied up $0 for Trump's border wall. Now see No. 3, below. (Side note: Trump's 71st birthday is coming up on June 14.) Anyway, let's get started ... 1. Here's a helpful assortment of spin on the Spending Deal That Is and the Shutdown That Won't Be: "Congress Inks Spending Deal That Jettisons Trump Priorities," per Bloomberg; "Bipartisan Agreement Reached to Fund Government Through September," per The New York Times; "Spending deal gives millions to NYPD for protecting Trump and family," per the New York Post; "Trump's wall won't get a penny as Congress agrees on $1trn spending plan," per Britain's The Independent -- and be sure to click through to see the photo of Trump the Indy chose to illustrate their story. 2. Because Ryan Seacrest doesn't have enough jobs already ... Today's the day! @RyanSeacrest is Kelly's new co-host! #LiveKellyCohost #KellyandRyan #RyanSeacrest pic.twitter.com/MranogG7nO — LIVE with Kelly (@LiveKelly) May 1, 2017 Apple CEO Tim Cook. Credit: Apple 3. "Apple Inc. is expected to report Tuesday that its stockpile of cash has topped a quarter of a trillion dollars, an unrivaled hoard that is greater than the market value of either Wal-Mart Stores Inc. or Procter & Gamble Co. and exceeds the foreign-currency reserves held by the U.K. and Canada combined," per The Wall Street Journal's Tripp Mickle. 4. "Sebastian Gorka to leave White House amid accusations of links to far-right," per The Guardian. The former Fox News analyst and Breitbart editor, who was blocked from getting a National Security Council clearance because he was arrested in early 2016 for bringing a handgun through security at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, is staying mum for now. Meanwhile, over on the Breitbart home page right now: "White House Sources: Reports of Gorka Leaving White House Are 'Incorrect.'" 5. Speaking of Fox News, the O'Reilly-free network is super excited about the guest it has slated to appear on "The Fox News Specialists," its new 5 p.m. ET political talk show hosted by Eric Bolling, Katherine Timpf and Eboni K. Williams. You'll never guess who it is! OK, sorry, that was fake news; you will totally be able to guess. 6. Because Rupert Murdoch can never own enough media: "Fox Reportedly in Talks With Blackstone to Launch Joint Bid for Tribune Media," per Variety. 7. And finally, ICYMI: "Samantha Bee's 'Not the White House Correspondents' Dinner': the best and worst moments," courtesy of Vox. Here's the part where Jake Tapper asks Bee, "Were you lying then or are you lying now?" Simon Dumenco, aka Media Guy, is an Ad Age editor-at-large. You can follow him on Twitter @simondumenco.

To be clear, the justices made no decision on the merits of the law that would reduce carbon emissions by 32% by 2030. What it did was to hold in “abeyance” its ruling so that the Trump administration could determine its approach. To that end, the White House could withdraw its support altogether, it could significantly weaken the Obama rule or it could slightly modify the one the Obama administration put forth. “This is obviously important but not terribly surprising. I don’t think the DC Circuit has ever gone ahead and decided on the legality of a rule when a new administration says it plans to rescind or revise it,” says Jeff Holmstead, a partner in the Bracewell law firm in Washington. If the Court had upheld the rule, it wouldn’t have prevented the new (Trump) Administration from revoking it, but it might have made this effort harder.”  Some background: In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that carbon dioxide is a pollutant that could be regulated under the Clean Air Act—something that EPA made official in 2009, saying it was a danger to public health and welfare. And in 2014, the high court upheld that so-called endangerment finding. That ruling is the foundation behind President Obama’s Clean Power Plan and the one that the Trump administration is honor-bound to enforce. But in February 2016, the Supreme Court issued a “stay” to address some concerns of several states before sending the case back to the DC Court of Appeals, where a decision to either uphold the law or remand it back to Trump’s EPA will come in due time. No matter how it rules, it will head back to the high court, which is now has a ninth Justice in Neil Gorsuch who could be the deciding vote. When it comes to the legal merits of the Clean Power Plan, those who say it is unconstitutional and it should be tossed aside argue that it usurps the rights of states and forces the retirement of at least 49,000 megawatts of coal-fired capacity. But other legal experts say that EPA’s rule gives states several alternative options to comply, such as replacing their coal-fired generation with plants that run on cleaner natural gas, or with green energies. States with a lot of coal, for instance, have less stringent requirements. The appeals court’s “decision doesn’t change the fact that any attempted replacement of the last regulation must articulate how the EPA is meeting its obligations to protect public health under the Clean Air Act, including a public process of notice and comment,” says Jonathan Levy, formerly the Deputy Chief of Staff to Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz under Obama. So what is big business to do? Nearly half of the Fortune 500, for example, is taking steps to track and reduce their carbon emissions. Those companies are also trying to improve energy efficiencies and to increase their consumption of renewable energy, according to the just-released Power Forward 3.0 report. And as the cost of the technologies and the fuels drop, companies are striving to do more and more. So, it would stand to reason that the businesses listed in that report support efforts to bring states into compliance. Practically speaking, their customers are demanding a greener presence and they are meeting that market demand. Some of the companies included are: Bank of America, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, IBM, Proctor & Gamble, General Mills, Kellogg Company and WalMart. “Companies are not waiting for policymakers to catch up with the realities of climate change,” said Anne Kelly, director of public policy at Ceres, a nonprofit sustainability advocacy group. “States with unstable climate and energy policy environments will discourage corporate investments and miss out on jobs and economic growth.” Along with Ceres, the World Wildlife Fund, Calvert Investments and David Gardiner and Associates contributed to the report. It is not accurate to equate the court’s allowance for a delay with its ultimate decision. Some insiders think it implies the case will get sent back to Trump’s EPA so that it can water it down. If that were the case, the appeals court would have given EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt the unlimited time he had requested to review the ruling; the justices gave his agency just 60 days. “At the very least, (the) ruling means that it will not take as long for the (Trump) Administration to undo the Clean Power Plan,” insists Bracewell’s Holmstead. Lots of disagreement there, however: No matter how the courts ultimately decide the Clean Power Plan, a lot of experts think that market pressures will continue to force both utilities and industry to step up and to provide cleaner solutions.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Global Bio-based Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) Market Analysis 2014 – 2025 – Research and Markets DUBLIN, May 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Research and Markets has announced the addition of the „Bio-based Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) Market Analysis By Application (Bottles, Technical, Consumer Goods), By Region (North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Central & South America), And Segment Forecasts, 2014 – 2025” report to their offering. The global bio-based Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) market is expected to reach USD 6.73 billion by 2025 Growing demand for sustainable packaging solutions including bottles and cartons is expected to drive the demand for bio-based PET. The adoption of Kyoto Protocol in economies, such as Japan, Australia, and Canada, and the Montreal Protocol in the U.S. and Canada, are expected to further restrict the use of products contributing to GHG emission, thus, driving the demand for bio-based products such as PET. Consumer goods are projected to witness growth at a CAGR of 11.2%, in terms of volume, from 2016 to 2025. Rising demand for eco-friendly packaging among personal care companies including P&G is expected to play a vital role in increasing the market size for bio-based PET in consumer goods. Further key findings from the report suggest: Bio-based PET is used in the form of sheets, foams, and fabrics for automotive and electronics applications. High shatter resistance and light weight properties are expected to fuel bio-based PET demand for the manufacturing of internal and exterior automotive parts. Europe was the second largest market, which is likely to account for 27.1% of global volume by the end of 2025. Rising awareness about reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the manufacturing sector in accordance with the implementation of Horicon 2020 Strategy on a regional level is expected to remain a favorable factor. Central & South America is projected to be one of the most lucrative destinations for producing bio-based PET on account of abundance availability of sugar alcohol sources including corn and sugarcane in Brazil. In addition, rapid growth of soft drinks market in Brazil is expected to remain a key driving factor over the next nine years. Rapid industrialization across the Middle East is anticipated to drive the growth of various sectors such as construction, packaging, electronics, and automotive in the region which is expected to play a fundamental role in increasing the demand for bio-based PET over the next nine years. The market is estimated to be worth USD 241.6 million by 2025. The market is marked by the presence of few players including The Coca-Cola Company, Toray Industries Inc., Teijin Limited, M&G Chemicals, and Toyota Tsusho.

Subscribe on iTunes http://apple.co/2eX6Eay ... Visit the online home of Playbook http://politi.co/2f51Jnf Good Monday morning and happy first day of May. SPOTTED -- Trump National Economic Adviser Gary Cohn and Ways and Means Republicans Sunday at Agua 301 on the Southeast Waterfront. Republicans are in town for a two-day tax reform retreat. Story Continued Below THE WEEK is starting off on a good note for Republicans. Congress reached a budget deal through the end of September, staving off a potentially dramatic couple of weeks and more talk of a shutdown. And, House Republicans look potentially poised to vote on their health care bill before they head out of town Thursday for a one-week recess. While Republicans are projecting confidence, it’s unclear whether they’ve been able to convince enough moderates to back the package. IF, AND IT IS A BIG IF, Congress is able to clear the funding fight and House Republicans pass the health care bill, the Senate could get started on it. And then -- and only then -- Republicans could begin to discuss tax reform. BUT -- It’s always important to remember: in Trump’s Washington, things could be turned upside down quickly. **SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/2lQswbh WE’VE GOT A DEAL -- “Budget deal reached in Congress,” by Burgess Everett, John Bresnahan, and Sarah Ferris: “Congressional leaders have reached a government funding agreement through the end of September, according to several congressional aides familiar with the matter. The deal delivers $15 billion in new defense spending to fight terrorism, with $2.5 billion of that contingent on President Donald Trump presenting a strategy to defeat the Islamic State to Congress, the aides said. It also distributes $1.5 billion in new border security spending, though it does not allocate any new money to a Southern border wall with Mexico despite President Donald Trump's insistence.” http://politi.co/2oOsm5A -- THE WINNERS: Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and other Appalachian senators for getting permanent health insurance for coal miners. Former President Barack Obama for the $2 billion in new funds for the NIH and Obama’s cancer moonshot. -- DEMS 1, TRUMP 0: Trump got very little of what he wanted. He got no money to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and roughly half the extra military funding he wanted. -- WHAT THIS MEANS: This bill will likely fly through Congress this week, which will ratchet up pressure on Republicans to get an Obamacare repeal through. WHERE THINGS STAND ON HEALTH CARE -- “GOP faces make-or-break moment on Obamacare repeal,” by Rachael Bade, John Bresnahan, and Kyle Cheney: “House Republican leaders and White House officials are increasingly confident about passing their long-stalled Obamacare replacement bill: More lawmakers than ever are committed to voting ‘yes,’ they say, and GOP insiders insist they’re within striking distance of a majority. But the window of opportunity for Speaker Paul Ryan and his leadership team is closing fast. The House is scheduled to leave town for a one-week recess on Thursday, and some senior Republicans worry that failing to get it done by then would fritter away critical momentum. “Skittish Republicans would return home to face a barrage of pressure from Democrats and progressive outside groups. Some senior Republicans and White House officials are advising Ryan (R-Wis.) and his top lieutenants to cancel the recess if needed, and to keep the House in session until they have the votes.” http://politi.co/2oXe3Xr VOX’S TAKE -- “An interview suggests Trump doesn’t know what's in his health bill: Either the president doesn’t understand the proposal — or isn’t telling the truth about it,” by Sarah Kliff: John “Dickerson is the first journalist I have seen grill Trump on what, exactly, is in the Republican plan. He isn’t asking about the politics of the bill and whether it will pass. Rather, he focuses on what are arguably basic questions: what elements are in this bill, and what do you think of them? “Trump stumbles. He says that people with pre-existing conditions will be protected. Under the latest amendment to the American Health Care Act -- the one that got the Freedom Caucus on board -- they won’t be. ... “The health care plan that Trump described on Face the Nation is not the one that the Republican party has offered. His answers suggest an unfamiliarity with basic policy details of a plan that has been public for nearly six weeks at this point -- a plan that his administration has pushed Congress to pass.” http://bit.ly/2p09s7V -- THE NARRATIVE that Trump doesn’t understand the details of the health care bill is taking hold. NYT: “Pushing for Vote on Health Care Bill, Trump Seems Unclear on Its Details” http://nyti.ms/2px2zMc NYT, A1 -- “Trump’s ‘Very Friendly’ Talk With Duterte Stuns Aides and Critics Alike,” by Mark Landler: “When President Trump called President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines on Saturday, White House officials saw it as part of a routine diplomatic outreach to Southeast Asian leaders. Mr. Trump, characteristically, had his own ideas. “During their ‘very friendly conversation,’ the administration said in a late-night statement, Mr. Trump invited Mr. Duterte, an authoritarian leader accused of ordering extrajudicial killings of drug suspects in the Philippines, to visit him at the White House. Now, the administration is bracing for an avalanche of criticism from human rights groups. Two senior officials said they expected the State Department and the National Security Council, both of which were caught off guard by the invitation, to raise objections internally. ... “Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on Twitter, ‘We are watching in real time as the American human rights bully pulpit disintegrates into ash.’” http://nyti.ms/2pyUhpt ****** A message from JPMorgan Chase & Co.: What builds the strongest bonds between communities and the businesses they serve? The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, Red Cross CEO Gail McGovern, Shinola President Jacque Panis and other leading thinkers shared their thoughts in the JPMorgan Chase Corporate Responsibility Report. http://politi.co/2qf8XaS ****** RETIREMENT WATCH -- First it was Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah). Now, it’s Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. The Florida Republican, who is the state’s longest serving member of Congress, will step down at the end of the 115th Congress. -- MARC CAPUTO on Ros-Lehtinen’s retirement: “Ros-Lehtinen denied that her retirement had anything to do with her differences with President Donald Trump. She has long opposed Trump’s position on illegal immigration, didn’t support his recent Obamacare repeal effort and disagreed with his administration's policies on transgender rights. Ros-Lehtinen has a transgender child. “In leaving Florida’s newly drawn 27th Congressional District, Ros-Lehtinen almost assured the Democrats will pick up her seat. No Republican-held House district gave Trump a lower share of the vote in 2016 than Ros-Lehtinen’s. Trump got just 39 percent of the vote in the district, while Hillary Clinton got more than 58 percent – more than 5 points better than Barack Obama in 2012, even as Florida shifted into the Republican column in 2016.” http://politi.co/2qkueTH -- OUR SOURCES have been telling us for weeks that there are several GOP House members considering retirement. The reasons for wanting to leave Congress run the gamut from nothing getting done to wanting to cash out to not wanting to have to defend Trump on the campaign trail. PALACE INTRIGUE -- “Trump starts dismantling his shadow Cabinet,” by Michael Grunwald, Andrew Restuccia and Josh Dawsey: “The White House is quietly starting to pull the plug on its shadow Cabinet of Trump loyalists who had been dispatched to federal agencies to serve as the president’s eyes and ears. These White House-installed chaperones have often clashed with the Cabinet secretaries they were assigned to monitor, according to sources across the agencies, with the secretaries expressing frustration that the so-called ‘senior White House advisers’ are mostly young Trump campaign aides with little experience in government. “The tensions have escalated for weeks, prompting a recent meeting among Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, and other administration officials, according to two sources familiar with the meeting. Now, some of the advisers are being reassigned or simply eased out, the sources said, even though many of them had expected to be central players at their agencies for the long haul. The tumult underscores the growing pains that are still being felt throughout Trump’s government, more than 100 days into his term. ‘These guys are being set up for failure,’ said one administration source. ‘They’re not D.C. guys. They’re campaign people. They have no idea how government works.’” http://politi.co/2pwVJq1 DICKERSON AND TRUMP PART II -- DICKERSON: “You said you were disappointed in the Republicans in Congress. Why?” TRUMP: “Well, disappointed. They’re friends of mine, they’re really special people, whether it’s Freedom Caucus or Tuesday or Thursday or let’s go have a drink, that group. They’re great people, I know them all. And I can honestly say, a lot of them, I can honestly say I don’t dislike any of them. I like almost all of them a lot. And you know, we have some [lawmakers] that have never voted positively. But now we’re the governing party. Before it didn’t matter. They could vote no. It wouldn’t matter because President Obama was going veto everything and they didn’t have the Senate. Now we have the Senate, the House, and the White House. But these are great people. And I think you’re going to see the Republican Party really come together.” -- CBS THIS MORNING is broadcasting live from the White House this morning from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. with Charlie Rose, Norah O’Donnell and Gayle King. The show has administration officials starting with Gary Cohn booked with them as well as part two of their interview with Trump. HMM -- “Will Steve Bannon take over Heritage after Jim DeMint leaves? Mike Needham won’t say,” by Washington Examiner’s Philip Wegman: “Asked by Chris Wallace whether Heritage would be Bannon’s ‘safety net as he’s forced out of the White House,’ [Heritage Action CEO Mike] Needham demurred on ‘Fox News Sunday.’ ‘I can tell you,’ Needham replied, ‘there’s a lot of speculation in the room and in the media that never misses a chance to divide and attack conservatives.’” http://washex.am/2quVgnL THE JUICE … -- FIRST IN PLAYBOOK: JAMES RISEN, the Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times reporter, has started working on a new book for Houghton Mifflin about the history of the Church Committee and Sen. Frank Church. After intelligence abuses of the 1970s, the committee was set up to investigate the intelligence community and ways to reform it. Risen, who has previously written four books, told us he’s always been fascinated by the Church Committee, and wants to explore the “watershed” role it played in the history of U.S. intelligence and the “growth of the national security state.” Playbook Reads IN MOSCOW -- “How the Republican right found allies in Russia,” by WaPo’s Ros Helderman and Tom Hamburger: “On issues including gun rights, terrorism and same-sex marriage, many leading advocates on the right who grew frustrated with their country’s leftward tilt under President Barack Obama have forged ties with well-connected Russians and come to see that country’s authoritarian leader, Vladimir Putin, as a potential ally. “The attitude adjustment among many conservative activists helps explain one of the most curious aspects of the 2016 presidential race: a softening among many conservatives of their historically hard-line views of Russia. To the alarm of some in the GOP’s national security establishment, support in the party base for then-candidate Donald Trump did not wane even after he rejected the tough tone of 2012 nominee Mitt Romney, who called Russia America’s No. 1 foe, and repeatedly praised Putin.” http://wapo.st/2p0b41q BUSINESS BURST -- “Apple’s Cash Hoard Set to Top $250 Billion: Tech giant’s unequaled stash draws calls for buybacks, acquisitions as corporate tax shift looms,” by WSJ’s Tripp Mickle: “Apple Inc. is expected to report Tuesday that its stockpile of cash has topped a quarter of a trillion dollars, an unrivaled corporate hoard that is greater than the market value of both Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co. and exceeds the combined foreign-currency reserves held by the U.K. and Canada combined. “The money, more than 90% of which is stockpiled outside of the U.S., has drawn fresh attention as President Donald Trump has proposed slashing business taxes and a one-time tax holiday on corporate cash brought home. That could ratchet up pressure on the tech giant to make splashy acquisitions or dole out more money to shareholders.” http://on.wsj.com/2p06IYa IS HE, OR ISN’T HE? -- “Biden to Democrats: Rediscover what you are,” by Isaac Dovere in Manchester, New Hampshire: “Yes, Joe Biden said, the Democratic Party is in crisis. And so is America. But it’s not too late. Returning repeatedly here to the combined 172,000-vote margin in the three states that decided last year’s presidential election, the former vice president said Democrats need to face how deep the problem is — not a fluke, not just about Hillary Clinton’s performance, not just about a campaign by Donald Trump that clearly disgusted him. … “He quickly tried to pierce the tension in the air. ‘Guys, I’m not running,’ Biden insisted at the beginning of his speech, acknowledging with a smile on his face the speculation stoked by his appearance in the first-in-the-nation primary state — a declaration met by the crowd leaping to its feet for a brief ‘Run, Joe, Run!’ chant. Biden didn’t mention the conversations he and his staff are having about building a strategy so that he’ll be best positioned to run if he decides to at the end of next year — or his longtime consultant Mike Donilon, who was perhaps most in favor of his running in 2016, who watched the speech from the side of the room.” http://politi.co/2oXgSb0 ****** A message from JPMorgan Chase & Co.: “Our model combines financial commitments with capable partners, evidence-based solutions and direct investments of our people’s time and expertise.” Read “Private Enterprise for Public Good” by Jamie Dimon in the JPMorgan Chase Corporate Responsibility Report. http://politi.co/2oFpSGE ****** DEEP DIVE -- EVAN OSNOS in The New Yorker, “How Trump Could Get Fired: The Constitution offers two main paths for removing a President from office. How feasible are they?”: “Between October and March, the U.S. Office of Government Ethics received more than thirty-nine thousand public inquiries and complaints, an increase of five thousand per cent over the same period at the start of the Obama Administration. Nobody occupies the White House without criticism, but Trump is besieged by doubts of a different order, centering on the overt, specific, and, at times, bipartisan discussion of whether he will be engulfed by any one of myriad problems before he has completed even one term in office—and, if he is, how he might be removed.” http://bit.ly/2pzGU8h THE GLOBAL POLITICO PODCAST -- In a new interview for Susan Glasser’s Global Politico podcast, former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt explains why Trump is more unpopular than former President George W. Bush in Europe and the prospects for a new cold war with Russian President Vladimir Putin. http://politi.co/2oXnVjZ … Transcript http://politi.co/2pwWu2q … Listen and subscribe http://apple.co/2kJ9q1U MEDIAWATCH -- “Fox in talks with Blackstone to buy Tribune Media: Joint bid for TV station operator aims to trump rival offer from Sinclair Broadcasting,” by FT’s Matthew Garrahan in Los Angeles: “Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox is in talks with Blackstone, the private equity firm, to launch a joint bid for Tribune Media, according to two people familiar with the negotiations. “Tribune, which owns a portfolio of US television stations, has a market capitalisation of $3.2bn. Fox and Blackstone hope to trump a rival offer from Sinclair Broadcasting, the largest owner of US television stations, and plan to form a joint venture for the deal, with Blackstone providing the cash and Fox injecting its own portfolio of stations. “Fox has 28 owned and operated stations in the US but its broadcast network is carried by dozens of other stations -- some of which are owned by Tribune. Its bid plans are partly defensive: if Sinclair succeeds in buying Tribune it will own these stations and be better placed to drive a harder bargain in carriage negotiations with Fox. Combining its station portfolio with Tribune would give Fox more ways to exploit sports rights, particularly the US National Football League.” http://on.ft.com/2qkrTIf -- BREITBART has released a free 71-page ebook called “The First 100 Days of Trump: Breitbart Special Report.” To download the book, it requires you to submit your name and email. http://bit.ly/2p0eQbe Playbookers SPOTTED -- Former Senate majority leaders Tom Daschle and Trent Lott, along with their wives, having Sunday brunch at Four Seasons in Georgetown … Labor Secretary Alex Acosta and his wife and kids yesterday out and about on King Street in Old Town Alexandria, heading into Carluccio’s restaurant ...

By ShawnLanglois Social-media editor The plucky souls who somehow managed to ride U.S. stocks to profits during this so-called Trump rally have been rewarded in a big way, but are they still feeling the market love after the first 100 days? If you’re getting a little squeamish about the near-term fate of your portfolio, now might be an opportune time to shed your home bias and look to diversify abroad. Nobody would blame you, of course, for sticking with what’s worked. After all, it’s been a long, tough slog for European investors. As Michael Batnick of the Irrelevant Investor blog points out: “If you diversified across the Atlantic — the equivalent of eating your peas and carrots — you would have received zero over the past decade.” Making that ”zero” feel a whole lot worse is the fact that U.S. stocks have doubled over that same period of time. So why the potential shift? This chart shows the rolling 10-year performance difference between the two regions. The blue line indicates when Europe has shined brighter over the previous 10 years, while the red shows when the U.S. has outperformed. The green shows when U.S. equities have beaten Europe to the extremes we’re seeing today. This is the important point: “In the 44 previous readings when the spreads reached 100%, European stocks went on to outperform for the subsequent 10 years.” So a makeover could very well be afoot. Our chart of the day (see below) also backs the assertion that Europe is poised to shake up the trend. “With the difference in valuations, the recent performance, and investor flows, it might be time to consider investing at least a portion of your portfolio outside the U.S.,” Batnick wrote in a post for the CFA Institute’s Enterprising Investors forum that earns our coveted call of the day honors. U.S markets are slated to open as usual this morning, but many other exchanges around the world are shuttered for the May 1 holiday. Key market gauges Futures for the Dow YMM7, -0.04%  and the S&P ESM7, -0.06%  both showed early gains, while gold GCM7, +0.13%  was stuck in the red early. The trend held for most of the morning. Stocks are coming off a weak Friday, although all three major U.S. equity benchmarks closed the month firmly in positive territory. There’s a lot to keep indexes moving this week, including a huge number of high-profile earnings reports, with updates from Apple AAPL, +2.04% , Tesla TSLA, +2.79%  and Facebook FB, +1.47% . See the Market Snapshot column for the latest action. The buzz You apparently can stop worrying for now about a U.S. government shutdown. Elon Musk’s SpaceX just had another successful launch, and his TEDTalk last Friday in Vancouver is still getting lots of attention. One of the presentation's more compelling nuggets was his bold call that Tesla will have a self-driving car by the end of the year capable of driving from Los Angeles to New York. Take a look at this post from Musk. Dish DISH, -2.34% looks on track for an up day after its earnings, while Neurotrope NTRP, -62.95%  has been hit hard after trial results for an Alzheimer’s disease drug. Amazon AMZN, +2.51%  will likely remain in the spotlight, as will its boss, Jeff Bezos, who briefly saw his net worth rocket over $80 billion for the first time ever last week. He’s getting closer to Bill Gates as the richest man in the world. Tribune Media TRCO, +5.99%  might get a joint buyout bid from 21st Century Fox FOXA, -0.49%  and Blackstone BX, +0.00%  . The chart The “speed bump” scenario just unfolded in Germany’s DAX DAX, -0.05% , according to Dana Lyons of J. Lyons Fund Management, and it could mean the country is on to the stock-market equivalent of the Autobahn. In theory, it’s time to fast-track some gains, but he said there could be some more “backing and filling” before the rally truly kicks in. “Like much of Europe, though, a new up-leg in the DAX does appear to be a good bet,” Lyons said in a blog post. The stat $250 billion — That’s how much stockpiled cash Apple AAPL, +2.04%  is expected to report this week when it hands in its quarterly results, according to The Wall Street Journal. Nobody else is even close and, for some perspective, it’s more than the total market value of both Wal-Mart WMT, +0.07%  and P&G PG, -0.27% . The quote “I would say it is an honor to be here, but that would be an alternative fact. It is not. No one wanted to do this. So of course it lands in the hands of an immigrant” — Comedian Hasan Minhaj, during his speech at the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner. Watch the full video of his roast: The economy The big number everybody will want to chew on arrives at the end of the week in the form of the April jobs report. As for today, a reading on inflation showed a retreat from a five-year peak. The ISM manufacturing index also hit. Looking ahead, we’ll get auto sales figures for last month on Tuesday. Read: Economy set for spring surge after first-quarter slumber. Random reads Silicon Valley elite are hot on this new, high-fat diet trend. And, fittingly, one writer explains why he’s quitting the Silicon Valley swamp. To fully understand the genius of Thomas Edison, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, just take a look at their desks. Speaking of Facebook’s fearless leader, he dropped in for a surprise dinner with this Ohio family of Trump supporters. To colonize space, how about starting closer to Earth?

By ShawnLanglois Social-media editor The plucky souls who somehow managed to ride U.S. stocks to profits during this so-called Trump rally have been rewarded in a big way, but are they still feeling the market love after the first 100 days? If you’re getting a little squeamish about the near-term fate of your portfolio, now might be an opportune time to shed your home bias and look to diversify abroad. Nobody would blame you, of course, for sticking with what’s worked. After all, it’s been a long, tough slog for European investors. As Michael Batnick of the Irrelevant Investor blog points out: “If you diversified across the Atlantic — the equivalent of eating your peas and carrots — you would have received zero over the past decade.” Making that ”zero” feel a whole lot worse is the fact that U.S. stocks have doubled over that same period of time. So why the potential shift? This chart shows the rolling 10-year performance difference between the two regions. The blue line indicates when Europe has shined brighter over the previous 10 years, while the red shows when the U.S. has outperformed. The green shows when U.S. equities have beaten Europe to the extremes we’re seeing today. This is the important point: “In the 44 previous readings when the spreads reached 100%, European stocks went on to outperform for the subsequent 10 years.” So a makeover could very well be afoot. Our chart of the day (see below) also backs the assertion that Europe is poised to shake up the trend. “With the difference in valuations, the recent performance, and investor flows, it might be time to consider investing at least a portion of your portfolio outside the U.S.,” Batnick wrote in a post for the CFA Institute’s Enterprising Investors forum that earns our coveted call of the day honors. U.S markets are slated to open as usual this morning, but many other exchanges around the world are shuttered for the May 1 holiday. Key market gauges Futures for the Dow YMM7, -0.02%  and the S&P ESM7, -0.04%  both showed early gains, while gold GCM7, +0.10%  was stuck in the red early. The trend held for most of the morning. Stocks are coming off a weak Friday, although all three major U.S. equity benchmarks closed the month firmly in positive territory. There’s a lot to keep indexes moving this week, including a huge number of high-profile earnings reports, with updates from Apple AAPL, +2.04% , Tesla TSLA, +2.79%  and Facebook FB, +1.47% . See the Market Snapshot column for the latest action. The buzz You apparently can stop worrying for now about a U.S. government shutdown. Elon Musk’s SpaceX just had another successful launch, and his TEDTalk last Friday in Vancouver is still getting lots of attention. One of the presentation's more compelling nuggets was his bold call that Tesla will have a self-driving car by the end of the year capable of driving from Los Angeles to New York. Take a look at this post from Musk. Dish DISH, -2.34% looks on track for an up day after its earnings, while Neurotrope NTRP, -62.95%  has been hit hard after trial results for an Alzheimer’s disease drug. Amazon AMZN, +2.51%  will likely remain in the spotlight, as will its boss, Jeff Bezos, who briefly saw his net worth rocket over $80 billion for the first time ever last week. He’s getting closer to Bill Gates as the richest man in the world. Tribune Media TRCO, +5.99%  might get a joint buyout bid from 21st Century Fox FOXA, -0.49%  and Blackstone BX, +0.00%  . The chart The “speed bump” scenario just unfolded in Germany’s DAX DAX, -0.05% , according to Dana Lyons of J. Lyons Fund Management, and it could mean the country is on to the stock-market equivalent of the Autobahn. In theory, it’s time to fast-track some gains, but he said there could be some more “backing and filling” before the rally truly kicks in. “Like much of Europe, though, a new up-leg in the DAX does appear to be a good bet,” Lyons said in a blog post. The stat $250 billion — That’s how much stockpiled cash Apple AAPL, +2.04%  is expected to report this week when it hands in its quarterly results, according to The Wall Street Journal. Nobody else is even close and, for some perspective, it’s more than the total market value of both Wal-Mart WMT, +0.07%  and P&G PG, -0.27% .

There are many metrics by which you can measure a company’s success. For instance, Apple has the world’s highest market capitalisation – that’s the price of a single Apple share, multiplied the number of shares issued. By that measure, Apple is worth an incredible $750 billion, making it the most valuable company on the planet. But Apple’s success can also be measured by the amount of liquid cash it has lying around. We’ve always known that Apple has had significant cash reserves, with the firm reporting nearly $82 billion back in September 2011. According to Marketwatch however, Apple is expected to report on Tuesday that it now has a stockpile of cash worth more than a quarter of a trillion dollars. That means Apple has racked up over $250 billion, and is saving it for a rainy day. What’s more, Marketwatch reports that more than 90% of Apple’s cash reserves are stockpiled outside of the US. Apple, the company behind the iPhone, is richer than ever before To put that mind-boggling sum into perspective, $250 billion exceeds the combined foreign-currency reserves of the UK and Canada combined. It’s also greater than the market value of both Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co., both corporate giants in their own respect. It also means that Apple’s cash reserves outstrip the gross domestic product of 148 countries around the world, including large economies like Finland, Portugal, and New Zealand, as based on IMF forecast figures for 2017. Having high cash reserves is a great boon for companies, as it means their value isn’t tied up in potentially risky and illiquid assets. It also means Apple can more easily justify moonshots, like its secretive Apple Car development program that’s reportedly codenamed Project Titan. Apple is expected to release its quarterly earnings tomorrow, detailing the firm’s finances over the last three months.

Jack Smith May 1, 2017, 12:13 pm There is also $97.5B of debt. Plus 96% of the cash is offshore. So if NO tax holiday there is 35% + 8.84% that comes out of the 96% and then deduct the $97.5B. So tons and tons of cash but actually not the most and the amount is a little misleading, IMO. Compare to Alphabet that has 60% offshore and less than $4B of debt so in a true apples to apples has more. Jean-Mouloud May 1, 2017, 1:41 pm That's the kind of time you feel happy not to have contributed a single penny to that ridiculous amount of cash they make thanks to the margins on their products, at the depends of hard working cheap labour in China and the likes. Jean-Mouloud May 1, 2017, 1:43 pm So you think they just keep it in cash? xD toboev May 1, 2017, 3:44 pm Er, yes. There's a reason why it's called "cash" in the balance sheet. But I'll settle for CCE. Everlast May 1, 2017, 9:32 pm It's good that Apple has a lot of cash, but the problem is that their CEO Tim Cook has no clue what he's doing. He spends all of his time solving imaginary social-justice issues, that he's obsessed with, and no time thinking about the future of smart phones and computers. He's more worried that men and women in the company are paid equally, than what products are coming out of the door. The board needs to urgently wake him up, from his rainbow dream, or directly replace him. Five years ago there were reasons to buy Apple products. Year by year the reasons disappear, and there is not a lot left. They have less than two years before the market sinks them.

A study conducted by The International Women’s Health Coalition, received over 90,000 responses, spanning 190 different countries found that there are 5,000 different slang terms for the word “period". It’s no wonder then that menstruation is still a taboo in some parts of the world, including India. While the dialogue on period taboo and breaking the silence around it is crucial, measures for sustainable disposal of sanitary waste cannot be excluded from these conversations. Thiruvananthapuram has recognised this need by introducing the sustainable menstruation project, ‘Green the Red’. Green the Red is a straightforward campaignlaunched earlier this year by women who participated in the Bengaluru Pinkathon. The campaign attempts to spread information on alternatives to sanitary pads like the menstrual cup. According to J Devika, a professor at the Centre for Development Studies in Thiruvananthapuram, the drive (which has taken off in Karnataka as well) is being promoted by the city’s civic authorities, and the Thiruvananthapuram-based NGO Thanal is suggesting kickstarting the composting of sanitary waste. Representational image. Reuters. Thiruvananthapuram is also introducing various measures to create awareness that more needs to be done to encourage women to use eco-friendly alternatives to regular napkins. These include putting in place vending machines with cotton pads (three for Rs 10) in public spaces. Women having access to disposable pads is still a recent phenomenon, as they have traditionally recycled cloth scraps, and last year reports claimed that only 12 percent of the country’s menstruating women have access to pads. A serious discussion concerning waste management has always brought the spotlight on the need for an effective and environment-friendly disposal system for sanitary pads, because unsanitary disposal of menstrual waste regularly leads to the clogging of landfills, drainage and sewage systems. Talking about the sanitary pad waste footprint also leads us to focus on those handling it, like waste pickers, who tend to contract hepatitis, bacterial and other infections from handling pads that are wet, and occasionally, not covered. Last year, #PeriodofChange, a campaign created by the Kachra project (a socio-environmental movement around waste management in India) that held online seminars about sustainable menstrual hygiene and biodegradable alternatives to disposable sanitary pads, estimated that 150 kg of non-biodegradable absorbents from sanitary material are thrown in the trash by women every year. Environmental activists also reported that gel-based disposable sanitary napkins, which use super-absorbent polymers (a material, also known as slush powder, which can absorb large amounts of liquid) could take up to 500 years to decompose. The methods used to dispose sanitary waste vary across the country. Although technically, items containing blood or body fluids should be categorised as biomedical waste, used sanitary napkins are most often mixed with regular waste and collected by municipal corporations. So the government turned to incineration of menstrual waste that was heavily promoted by Swachh Bharat and Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan, its sanitation drives. And the incineration of pads through ‘mini incinerators’ was initially promoted in Tamil Nadu. But states and environmental activists remain divided about whether incineration is the answer. For instance, the Kerala government banned the installation of mini incinerators because they didn’t comply with the Central Pollution Control Board’s directives — this included the fact that they burnt sanitary waste at temperatures lower than that recommended by WHO guidelines, which suggest that health waste be burned at over 800 degrees. Incineration also leads to the emission of toxic fumes, which could trigger respiratory diseases. Shradha Shreejaya, an ecologist with the Kerala-based NGO Thanal, who is also part of the Sustainable Menstruation Collective in Kerala (a group of activists associated with various gender rights and environmental campaigns) says that sanitary waste is a particularly huge issue in the state. “Sanitary waste is not collected using a door-to-door system in Kerala. So women either burn or bury their waste in their backyards. Some flush it down the toilet, which also creates sewage problems, and, of course, complications arise because of manual scavenging. When they are burnt, it is just as bad, because the pads contain approximately 90 percent plastic, as well as gel and chlorine, which means we inhale these harmful dioxins.” While she agrees that campaigns like Green the Red are showing great promise by creating awareness about reusable menstrual products, Shreejaya maintains that there is still a long way to go to encourage women to switch to eco-friendly products. This is particularly because of the drawbacks that accompany environmental-friendly products: “At the moment, banana fibre pads and organic pads for instance, are expensive, so no organisation is being able to create a profitable model. The pricing isn’t competitive yet either, and would need government subsidies or similar endorsements to make them more accessible.” Another hitch that Shreejaya points out is that the health, quality, and hygiene standards for pads are still dictated by industrial standards, and often influenced by the research and development wings of multinational companies like Kimberly-Clark or Procter & Gamble. The companies disqualify biodegradable and reusable products, (which have, in the past, been less than forthcoming about discussions on managing menstrual waste management) so that even gynaecologists are reluctant to refer them to their patients. But there’s an eco-friendly alternative that has been steadily doing the rounds on both social media and in the news — the reusable menstrual cup. Bharti Kannan, an activist for the menstrual cup with Boondh, an organisation that sells the cup for Rs 500 and provides subsidies in marginalised communities in Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand and others, says that reusable pads are not affordable for everyone. While she applauds Thiruvananthapuram’s efforts to promote eco-friendly alternatives, she wishes more options, from period panties to cloth pads and the cup were also endorsed by the scheme, so that women with different lifestyles can choose from a combination of products. What about other Indian cities? Some have witnessed a renewed interest in an attempt to start conversations about increasing access to low-cost sanitary pads — Tamil Nadu-based entrepreneur Arunachalam Muruganantham’s ‘low cost’ sanitary pad machine was a particularly notable innovation — and changing the way we dispose of our sanitary waste. In February, the ‘Red Dot’ campaign was launched in collaboration with Pune’s waste-picker cooperative and trade unions, and demanded that people mark their sanitary waste with a red dot to identify it. But while this initiative could well make a tangible difference to the workers handling sanitary waste, other campaigns like research associate Deane de Menezes’ efforts in Mumbai schools, tend to fall back on the pad-dispenser-and-incinerator model, which brings you back to square one as far as environmental concerns go. It’s too early to tell whether the campaign in Thiruvananthapuram will see enormous success. For now, its prioritisation of environmental concerns by making sure women have access to eco-friendly napkins (rather than solely promoting incineration), and its sensitivity to consumer needs through its focus on cheap alternatives, appears to be a move in the right direction. One that perhaps, India’s other metros can emulate.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Wellbeing Beauty Brand, Philosophy and Its Hope & Grace Initiative, Kick off Mental Health Month with “How Are You, Really?” PSA and National Campaign NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)–In recognition of National Mental Health Month, Philosophy’s Hope & Grace Initiative supports women’s mental health by unveiling its first national campaign ‘How Are You, Really?’ in order to create real conversation between those living with mental health issues and those who want to support them. Approximately 1 in 5 adults in the U.S.—43.8 million—experiences mental illness in a given year.* Simultaneously, 91% of the U.S. general population agree that they would want a family member or friend to tell them if they were suffering from depression.** The ‘How Are You, Really?’ campaign and public service announcement (PSA) engages real women with that simple question, to open up a thought-provoking dialogue illustrating how the stigma that is often associated with mental health can be replaced with hope and optimism. These conversations help bridge the gap between the people who live with mental illness and their friends and family. “This campaign defines the Hope & Grace Initiative’s mental health-related purpose,” said Marie-Pierre Stark-Flora, Global SVP of Philosophy and Hope & Grace Fund Advisory Board member. “We all have mental health, whether a diagnosed mental illness or a moment in your life, so asking ‘how are you, really?’ creates a platform to open up about how we’re really doing – what we’re really feeling. Speaking freely is ultimately the first step in healing. The Hope & Grace Initiative is just helping facilitate the conversation to get there.” By being asked “How Are You, Really?,” everyone can respond when a platform of support is laid, allowing those living with mental health issues to open up about how they’re really feeling. One conversation at a time, the Hope & Grace Initiative is inviting people to help eliminate the stigma that surrounds women’s mental health. In partnership with ad agency Badger & Winters, the Hope & Grace Initiative’s ‘How Are You Really’ PSA features real individuals being heard, being seen, being honest, and letting down their defenses. The concept focuses on the breadth of the human experience, and creates connections between participants and viewers. PSA Director, Kat Keene Hogue drew her inspiration from her fascination with people and the hidden emotions we all carry as we move through the world. In the PSA, Kat interviewed over a dozen strangers on the street with the goal of getting below the surface. When asked, „how are you, really?” the subjects share intensely personal experiences they’re grappling with, and, in the process, prove how just one conversation can help someone who is persevering in silence discover a feeling of hope. “I love the concept for this film because it’s so simple. It reminds us how easy it is to send someone, whether a stranger or a lifelong friend, towards a more hopeful day,” says Kat. Additionally, in support of National Mental Health Month, the Hope & Grace Initiative is launching an exclusive limited-edition product, releasing its first-ever issue brief on the state of women’s mental health, announcing its Spring 2017 grant recipients and the Empire State building will light up in green on May 1, in support. The Limited-Edition Product In partnership with Project 1 in 4, a creative organization dedicated to erasing the stigma surrounding mental health, Philosophy has re-imagined the look of its beloved Amazing Grace Body Emulsion with a limited-edition package featuring an illustration from Project 1 in 4 founder, Marissa Betley. „It has been an honor and thrill to partner with Philosophy in advancing their Hope & Grace Initiative,” said Marissa. “This year’s campaign beautifully captures how vulnerability and support go hand in hand in fighting mental health stigma. It truly has the power to change lives.” Available exclusively on Philosophy.com and the Philosophy concept store at Garden State Plaza, NJ, 100% of net proceeds from the sale of this limited-edition item will be donated to the Hope & Grace Fund. Women and Mental Health Issue Brief The Hope & Grace Fund contracted Arabella Advisors, a philanthropy consulting firm, to explore how the philanthropic sector views women’s mental health, why it does or does not invest in it, and the opportunities to improve the mental health of American women. Arabella Advisors conducted research by interviewing 18 stakeholders, including foundation staff members, policy influencers, and researchers to develop a forward-thinking paper. Among other findings, the brief explains how: Women’s mental health and wellbeing have traditionally received insufficient attention from the health care field, from government, and from philanthropy. This has created a gap that needs to be filled if we hope to see progress on numerous intersecting issues, from women’s rights to health care to education. Funders have an enormous opportunity to drive innovations and advancements in the field by providing catalytic resources, shining a light on the critical issues at stake, and encouraging those in other fields to take action. These impacts will start with women but extend to the children, families, and communities that depend upon them—including, crucially, economically challenged communities and communities of color. Many funders can increase their impact on this front simply by considering how existing programs could include efforts to improve women’s mental health. Beyond grant making, philanthropy can also foster innovative models through cutting-edge impact investment vehicles, support advocacy, and the creation of networks and collaboratives that can take effective action. Detailed findings can be found here. The Grants Philosophy is pleased to announce the Hope & Grace Fund’s Spring 2017 grant recipients. The execution of grants to this round of grantees brings the total grant donations by Hope & Grace fund to more than 3 million dollars to 48 organizations across the United States, since its inception just three years ago. This round, there was a strong focus by the advisory board to fund organizations dedicated to services for young women aged 18-30, a demographic that is specifically vulnerable to mental health issues. Find a full list of the Spring grantees here. Join the Hope & Grace Initiative in asking ‘How Are You Really?’ and join the conversation on social using hashtag #HowAreYouReally. Hope & Grace Fund The Hope & Grace Fund, a project of the New Venture Fund, represents an unprecedented and unending commitment by philosophy to support women’s mental health and wellbeing. With the initiative, philosophy becomes the first company to place a focus on this important cause and the first major beauty company to make a brand-wide commitment to dedicate 1% of its U.S. net sales toward the cause.

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Industry Technology From T-Mobile, Unilever Prank to KFC, here’s what hit the news around the world From T-Mobile, Unilever Prank to KFC, here’s what hit the news around the world The app will help a phone’s camera to activate and transform any targeted magenta surface into a virtual portal through which exclusive Gorillaz content, artwork and videos can be viewed. Published: May 2, 2017 2:15 AM The app will help a phone’s camera to activate and transform any targeted magenta surface into a virtual portal through which exclusive Gorillaz content, artwork and videos can be viewed. T-Mobile and Gorillaz team up for an AR gig Deutsche TeleKom, which owns the brand T-Mobile, has tied up with British virtual brand Gorillaz for its music project. Under the Telekom Electronic Beats programme, the European telco has launched The Lenz app. The app will help a phone’s camera to activate and transform any targeted magenta surface into a virtual portal through which exclusive Gorillaz content, artwork and videos can be viewed. To enable the app, magenta, the colour associated with the brand, was painted across various surfaces such as an abandoned building, Potter’s Field Park, an underground pass and even some London taxis. “This innovative AR application will allow users to experience a whole new dimension of the band, including a look inside the Gorillaz house — home to band members Murdoc Niccals, Russel Hobbs, 2D and Noodle, as well as exclusive video content. Over the coming weeks more and more content will be made available for fans to unlock, as Telekom’s technology allows them to get closer to the band than ever before,” informs the statement from the company. Wolfgang Kampbartold, VP — international marketing communications at Deutsche Telekom, said, “Innovative new AR applications allow us to blend one dimension with another to create something entirely new and never seen before, allowing fans to experience a level of depth and discovery previously unimaginable.” Saatchi & Saatchi’s London office has worked on the concept with an aim to attract tech-savvy millennial consumers. KFC aims to reach space Starting with a teaser campaign to a full-blown marketing gimmick aimed at sending its iconic Zinger burger into space, KFC has roped in actor Rob Lowe as the latest Colonel Sanders. In the 90-second spot, Lowe features as a mission commander addressing a press conference saying that the time is apt to “push crispy chicken to new heights”. In an ad conceptualised by Wieden + Kennedy, Portland, the colonel asks if “you can actually launch KFC’s world-famous Zinger sandwich into space”, while assuring viewers that the burger will actually be sent into space, and it has to work because the brand’s “entire marketing campaign depends on it”. The rousing address is met with applause from the US audience. “My grandfather was the head of the Ohio chapter of the National Restaurant Association in the 1960s and took me to meet Colonel Harland Sanders when I was a kid,” the actor said in a statement, adding, “It was a big deal. I thought this would be a nice homage to both Colonel Sanders and to my grandfather.” The product, which according to KFC’s US president and chief concept officer Kevin Hochman, a bestseller in 120 countries, launched in the US market recently. Prior to Lowe, KFC had roped in Billy Zane in January this year to launch Georgia Gold Chicken. However, in the campaign, he stepped out of Colonel Sanders’ iconic white suit and wore a gold one to match the new menu item. Other actors that have previously played the role of Colonel include Henderson Forsythe, Jim Gaffigan among others. Unilever plays a ‘suave’ prank It is widely said that ‘never judge a book by its cover’ but the phrase hardly has any believers, especially when it comes to beauty products. To bring back the thought, Unilever recently went undercover with its ‘cheap’ drugstore hair care brand — Suave. Calling it Evaus, the product in minimalist packaging was sent to few millennial beauty influencers and had them try it for two weeks. Post two weeks, they were called to a studio in New York City where its true identity was revealed. The social experiment from Vice’s digital agency Carrot for Suave Professionals was then released to convince women to not fall into the trap of buying only expensive products, and rather become a #SuaveBeliever. The experiment was to prove to young millennial women that price, label and packaging were not necessarily indicative of quality. Research from the brand shows that 92% of millennial women say they would buy a lower-priced hair care product as long as quality was not sacrificed, and seven in 10 women feel that premium brands are more trustworthy than value brands even as nine in 10 like purchasing value brands to get the most bang for their buck. “We are asking women to look past the label and reconsider Suave,” said Jen Bremner, director of marketing, Unilever. China’s usage of mobile internet continues to grow In 2017, adults in China will be spending an average of one hour and 38 minutes with their smartphones, according to eMarketer’s latest forecast. The mobile internet is capturing a growing share of daily time that adults in China spend on major media, informs the study. It further states that the reason of growing adoption is the availability of cheaper smartphones which has led to deeper engagement with devices. “As attention continues to migrate from offline to online formats and from desktop to mobile devices, advertising dollars, too, will shift,” said Shellen Shum, senior forecasting analyst at eMarketer, adding, “Coupled with improvements in targeting and measurability, digital and mobile ad formats will continue to fare better than their counterparts in traditional media.” The study estimates that by 2019, adults will spend an average of two hours and nine minutes with their smartphones per day. eMarketer forecasts that digital will account for 54.2% of total daily media time this year, while 40.6% of media time will be spent with TV, 2.1% with print and 3.1% with radio. Radio is the only traditional media format that will not see a decline in time spent this year. The study has also reduced estimates for time spent on print media as adults increasingly get their news from online platforms. Shum further said that TV will continue to suffer losses at the hands of digital video in China. “We expect online video platforms like iQiyi, Youku Tudou and  Tencent Video to take viewership from traditional TV. This is thanks to the quality of original content produced by the various providers and the on-demand nature of these services,” Shum said. Blocking ads: the new mantra It seems the race towards ad blocking is about to get more serious. Reportedly, digital giant Google is considering to introduce an ad blocking feature in its Chrome browser. Coalition for Better Ads (CBA) that includes Google, Microsoft, P&G, Unilever, GroupM, Facebook, Thomson Reuters, The Washington Post, Interactive Advertising Bureau and the Association of National Advertisers is also considering the move towards ad block. Google has not yet revealed the blueprint for its ad blocking feature. In March this year, CBA had released a research that revealed that consumers do not like autoplay video ads with sound and pop-up ads. CBA is in the midst of drawing a roadmap, even as experts doubt how it will differentiate between good formats and bad creatives, and monetising on digital platforms. The final decision is set to come out by September this year. Even as advertisers try to acquire consumers and look at their interest, monetising on digital medium might become more difficult if ad blocking is adopted at large scale. – Compiled by Ananya Saha No Comments.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Shaping the Fed By Ben White and Aubree Eliza Weaver 05/01/17 08:00 AM EDT SHAPING THE FED — POLITICO’s Victoria Guida: “The White House appears close to a decision on a nominee for the Federal Reserve seat vacated last month by Daniel Tarullo, according to a source familiar with the Fed search. “This source says it is the White House goal to announce picks for all three of the open Fed seats at the same time, although the administration is furthest away from picking a nominee for the job reserved for a community banker. Story Continued Below “If Randal Quarles, the expected nominee for vice chair of supervision, and the other Fed nominee clear all the necessary hurdles before someone is chosen for the community banking slot, those other two will likely be announced earlier. A candidate for the community banking slot has an interview at the White House today, the source said. “Speaking of community bankers, the Independent Community Bankers of America announced it will meet with Trump at the White House at 11 a.m. today. The meeting will focus on regulatory relief.” SPENDING DEAL REACHED — POLITICO’s Burgess Everett, John Bresnahan, Sarah Ferris: “Congressional leaders have reached a government funding agreement through the end of September, according to several congressional aides familiar with the matter. The deal delivers $15 billion in new defense spending to fight terrorism, with $2.5 billion of that contingent on President Donald Trump presenting a strategy to defeat the Islamic State to Congress … “It also distributes $1.5 billion in new border security spending, though it does not allocate any new money to a Southern border wall with Mexico despite Trump's insistence. … The legislation delivers wins to both parties, though they also had to compromise on some key issues … Democrats also fended off riders they view as anti-environmental and anti-abortion.” Read more. NYC GETS PAID BACK — The spending deal also includes million to reimburse local law enforcement for protecting Trump and his family, including NYC for the pricey defense of Trump Tower. ASSESSING THE 100 DAYS — PIMCO’s Libby Cantrill: “Looking at several metrics — legislative achievements, staffing in key areas and executive orders — President Trump’s first-100-day track record has been mixed. On one hand, Trump has had no major legislative achievements, and his relationship with Congress — a predictor for future legislative success — is not particularly strong … “On the other hand, the president has been active in terms of issuing executive orders, ranging from financial deregulation, to trade, to the tax code. Of course, executive orders without subsequent congressional action often have limited effectiveness and are frequently more symbolic than substantive” Read more. HERE COMES OBAMACARE REPEAL VOTE — POLITICO’s Rachael Bade, John Bresnahan, and Kyle Cheney: “House Republican leaders and White House officials are increasingly confident about passing their long-stalled Obamacare replacement bill: More lawmakers than ever are committed to voting ‘yes,’ they say, and GOP insiders insist they’re within striking distance of a majority. “But the window of opportunity for Speaker Paul Ryan and his leadership team is closing fast. The House is scheduled to leave town for a one-week recess on Thursday, and some senior Republicans worry that failing to get it done by then would fritter away critical momentum. Skittish Republicans would return home to face a barrage of pressure from Democrats and progressive outside groups.” Read more. ICYMI: THE TAX PLAN MESS — From the Mad Dash to 100 days piece I did with Josh Dawsey and Tara Palmeri that popped over the weekend: “Trump’s promise last Friday to deliver a tax plan within five days startled no one more than Gary Cohn, his chief economic adviser writing the plan. Not a single word of a plan was on paper, several administration officials said, and Treasury officials worked all weekend to draft a one-page summary of his principles because the president promised a Wednesday news conference. “Senior officials in the White House and Treasury wanted to keep working behind the scenes to create a more fully baked tax plan that would get support from Capitol Hill Republicans. Then, early this summer, they could roll out a detailed blueprint that would address concerns from House Speaker Paul Ryan and other fiscal conservatives worried about blowing up the deficit. “‘Nobody wanted to do this now. We weren’t ready to do this now. But we weren’t given any choice,’ said a second senior official close to the tax reform process.” Read more. TRUMP’S CRUMMY QUARTER — POLITICO’s Ben White: “The U.S. economy was not great again in the first quarter of Donald Trump’s presidency. The Commerce Department said … that gross domestic product expanded at just a 0.7 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year, a sharp drop from the 2.1 percent growth in the final quarter of last year. It marked the economy's worst performance since the first quarter of 2014. “First-quarter GDP data has been notoriously bad in recent years only to improve in subsequent months. But the grim headline … delivers a significant political blow to a president who loves to hype economic data like strong jobs reports even though his policies so far have little to do with them” Read more. HOW TO ACTUALLY DO TAX REFORM — Former Senator Bill Bradley in the NYT: “With President Trump now talking about overhauling the tax code, it’s worth reflecting on the last time Congress revamped the system: the Tax Reform Act of 1986. That bill’s success relied on a clear set of principles, a committed president, an effective Treasury secretary, bipartisan support and congressional committee chairmen willing to put their reputations on the line. “Few of those pieces seem in place today, and the Trump administration hasn’t even begun to face the trade-offs necessary to cut rates without increasing the deficit or widening the gap between rich and poor. But perhaps the lessons of the past show a way forward.” Read more. GOOD MONDAY MORNING — Happy May Day! Greetings from sunny L.A. where MM is hosting a panel at the Milken Institute Annual Meeting.

Trump has surrounded himself with Wall Street veterans to spearhead his deregulation efforts. He signed three executive actions on finance, including one ordering his Treasury secretary to draw up a plan and another that could remove the threat of additional oversight of large insurers and hedge funds … ."

Alpert: “Twitter Inc. has found its first partner for its push into round-the-clock streaming television: Bloomberg. The social-media company is joining forces with the global financial news outlet to create a service that will stream news produced solely for Twitter 24 hours a day, seven days a week. “‘It is going to be focused on the most important news for an intelligent audience around the globe and it’s going to be broader in focus than our existing network,’ said Bloomberg Media’s chief executive officer, Justin Smith. The partnership will be announced Monday at an event Bloomberg LP is holding for advertisers by company founder Michael Bloomberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.” Read more. ** A message from the Independent Community Bankers of America: Community banks power local economies one loan at a time. From local startups to home loans, community banks are the pipeline to economic prosperity for millions of Americans, fueling dreams, economic empowerment and local jobs. Learn more about what makes community banks different.www.icba.org/golocal ** WHAT WALL STREET WANTS FROM TRUMP NOW — Mohamed A. El-Erian on Bloomberg View: “With this [100 day] marker now in the rearview mirror, investors will be hoping for greater clarity and predictability when it comes to the content and implementation of policies — especially those that influence economic growth and corporate earnings. “Chief among these is the follow-up to last week's announcement of the broad outline of the Trump administration's tax reform proposal, including details on the measures and the congressional strategy that would help answer important questions on the prospective race between growth and debt” HERE COMES MORE BANK BASHING — Cap Alpha’s Ian Katz on the CHOICE Act markup: “Be prepared for more headline risk for big banks as lawmakers keep piling on the anti-Wall Street rhetoric. Most of it will be substantively meaningless. A backbencher wailing about how large banks should be broken up has no ability to make it happen. “But that doesn’t mean he or she can’t get attention and cause anxiety. As we’ve noted previously, the House is just a warm-up act for what happens in the Senate Banking Committee. Each of the important elements, including the CFPB, Volcker rule, OLA, FSOC and the leverage ratio, will be subject to debate in that more-measured committee.” TRUMP ON CHINA/NORTH KOREA — From Trump’s interview on CBS’ “Face the Nation: “If China can help us with North Korea and can solve that problem, that's worth making not as good a trade deal for the United States … right?” PENCE ON THE TAX PLAN — VP Mike Pence, to Chuck Todd on NBC's "Meet the Press” on the tax plan adding to the deficit: “Well maybe in the short term. But the truth is if we don't get this economy growing at three percent, or more as the president believes we can, we're never gonna meet the obligations that we've made today.” PRIEBUS ON CARRIED INTEREST — Reince Priebus, White House chief-of-staff, to Jonathan Karl on ABC's "This Week": “The president wants to get rid of carried interest. So that balloon's not going to stay inflated very long. I can assure you of that.” MM SIDE NOTE — So why wasn’t carried interest in the blueprint last week? REALITY CHECK ON CANADA — Gordon Ritchie, former Canadian ambassador for trade negotiations and deputy chief negotiator of the Canada-U.S. free-trade agreement, writes in the Globe and Mail: “[O]n two-way trade of $662.7-billion (all figures U.S.) in 2015, the latest data posted, ‘[t]he U.S. goods and services trade surplus with Canada was $11.9-billion.’That’s right: The Americans sell more to us than we sell to them under NAFTA” Read more. WALL STREET BOON FROM TRUMP’S SMALL BIZ TAX CUTS? — FT’s Barney Jopson: “The Trump administration has opened the door to huge potential savings for hedge fund and private equity managers by proposing to slash tax rates for small businesses in a way that could be exploited by Wall Street financiers. Hedge fund and private equity managers are a subgroup that could emerge with some of the biggest gains from … Trump’s tax plan, which was scorned by Democrats last week for offering generous benefits to the rich. “The potential windfall stems from an attempt to help small company owners. They currently pay business tax as individuals — with a top rate of 39.6 per cent — and the Trump team wants to cut their rate to 15 per cent, the same level as its proposal for bigger corporations. Most hedge fund and private managers are classed for taxes the same way as mom-and-pop stores, rural manufacturers and other small businesses” Read more. STOCKS OFF TO A CAUTIOUS START — Bloomberg’s Adam Haigh: “Asian equities began the trading week on a cautious note as the yen climbed with gold after data over the weekend showed a decline in Chinese manufacturing and services sectors, adding to weaker American growth that’s denting optimism about the global economy. “The MSCI Asia Pacific Index was flat after capping a fourth straight month of gains. Stocks in Japan were little changed in light trading as China’s factory gauge fell more than expected from March’s almost five-year high” Read more. APPLE’S CASH PILE EXPECTED TO TOP $250B — WSJ’s Tripp Mickle: “Apple Inc. is expected to report Tuesday that its stockpile of cash has topped a quarter of a trillion dollars, an unrivaled corporate hoard that is greater than the market value of both Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co. and exceeds the combined foreign-currency reserves held by the U.K. and Canada combined. “The money, more than 90 percent of which is stockpiled outside of the U.S., has drawn fresh attention as … Trump has proposed slashing business taxes and a one-time tax holiday on corporate cash brought home. That could ratchet up pressure on the tech giant to make splashy acquisitions or dole out more money to shareholders” Read more. FOX IN TALKS TO BUY TRIBUNE MEDIA — FT’s Matthew Garrahan: “Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox is in talks with Blackstone, the private equity firm, to launch a joint bid for Tribune Media, which owns a portfolio of US television stations, according to two people familiar with the negotiations. “Tribune has a market capitalisation of $3.2bn. Fox and Blackstone hope to trump a rival offer from Sinclair Broadcasting, another owner of US television networks, and plan to form a joint venture for the deal, with Blackstone providing the cash and Fox injecting its own portfolio of stations” Read more. BOND TRADERS’ INFLATION BETS REVITALIZED — Bloomberg’s Brian Chappatta: “Bond traders demonstrated this week that for all the doubts about the Trump trade, wagers on quicker inflation still have life. Look no further than the U.S. 10-year breakeven rate. It climbed the most on a weekly basis this year, rising back toward 2 percent, suggesting the market is starting to hop back on the inflation bandwagon. “The shift is taking place just in time for the Federal Reserve’s May 3 policy announcement. While traders see little chance of a hike this week, an increase is seen as much more likely in June, and is fully priced in by September, futures show. The focus this week may be on Fed officials’ assessment of the economic outlook after Trump administration fiscal initiatives that traders were betting on stalled.” Read more. ** A message from the Independent Community Bankers of America: By supporting community banks, you empower local economies. Community banks are the pipeline to economic prosperity for the American people and America’s communities. From local small businesses to home loans and beyond, loans made by community banks keep vital capital within local communities—strengthening local economies and creating jobs. With more than 5,800 community banks nationwide making $3.2 trillion in loans to consumers, small businesses, and the agricultural community, policymakers have the opportunity to unleash the full economic potential of Main Street right now by advancing tiered banking regulations that undo harmful regulatory burdens on America’s community banks.
