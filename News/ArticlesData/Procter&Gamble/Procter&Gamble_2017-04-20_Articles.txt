College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: These 3 Stocks Just Raised Their Dividends A high-profile chipmaker, an aristocratic consumer-goods purveyor, and a specialty REIT all lifted their payouts last week. Eric Volkman (TMFVolkman) Apr 20, 2017 at 8:10PM We're still in the wake of calendar 2017's first earnings season. So it wasn't surprising to see a raft of dividend raises last week, especially considering that this year has already been stuffed with lifts from every conceivable type of company. Here are three notables out of last week's crop. Image source: Getty Images. Qualcomm Following through on an earlier commitment, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has formally declared a new payout of $0.57 per share, an amount nearly 8% higher than its predecessor. Qualcomm's most recently reported quarterly results show that its business is still robust, despite several tough legal battles and a looming acquisition. The company's revenue continued to rise, increasing by almost 4% on a year-over-year basis to $6.0 billion. Adjusted earnings zoomed ahead by 23%, landing at $1.8 billion. That, by the way, shakes out in a very healthy net margin of 30%. Income investors might be wary of Qualcomm, as the company loves to spend its money -- at times, its dividend payouts and share buybacks have exceeded free cash flow. Compounding that matter, the company should soon close the door on its acquisition of European peer NXP Semiconductor (NYSE:NXP), a deal with an estimated enterprise value of $47 billion. I, for one, wouldn't worry. First, Qualcomm committed to its dividend just after signing the NXP Semiconductor deal. Second, those consistently high margins pump out a lot of cash, with operating cash flow in certain years approaching the $9 billion level. The new dividend will cost the company only about one-third that amount. QCOM Free Cash Flow (Annual) data by YCharts Qualcomm's upcoming payout is to be dispensed on June 21 to stockholders of record as of May 31. At the most recent closing share price, it would yield 4.3% -- more than double the almost 2% average of dividend-paying stocks on the S&P 500. Procter & Gamble The dividend aristocrats -- the small, vaunted group of stocks that have raised their payouts at least once annually for a minimum of 25 years running -- don't get much more regal than Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). The consumer-goods powerhouse has one of the longest raise streaks on the market, and it just lengthened it by another year. Its 61st consecutive annual lift is a 3% bump to just under $0.69 per share. PG Dividend data by YCharts Today's Procter & Gamble is a leaner and more focused company thanks to cost-cutting and a years-long run of asset sales. These have kept profitability afloat despite uninspiring top-line growth.  Yet the company still has an immense portfolio, so it can compensate for weakness in certain product categories with strength in others. The healthcare segment was the star of the most recently reported quarter, delivering 5% year-over-year net sales growth against the 1% drops of each of Procter & Gamble's other four product categories. So although free cash flow has dipped lately, to below $10 billion on a trailing-12-month basis, the company should continue to have more than enough dosh to keep that dividend raise streak alive. Plus, it's committed to returning nearly $20 billion to shareholders annually through 2019. I wouldn't worry about the future of this dividend, then.  Procter & Gamble's new distribution will be paid on May 15 to investors of record as of April 21. It yields a theoretical 3.1%. Hospitality Properties Trust  Specialty real estate investment trust Hospitality Properties Trust (NASDAQ:HPT) is adding a penny to its quarterly payout, lifting it to $0.52 per share. That works out to a 2% raise. As its name implies, Hospitality Properties Trust specializes in hotels and other traveler lodgings. At the end of last year, it owned or leased over 500 such facilities in the U.S. and Canada. Business is humming along these days for the REIT. Last month it reported its Q4 and fiscal 2016 results, both of which showed improvements in revenue and profitability. On the top line, the company took in nearly $2.05 billion, 7% higher than the 2015 result. Adjusted funds from operations (FFO) -- the most significant profitability metric for REITs -- jumped by 11% to over $561 million. What helps is that its properties are squeezing out more profit. Revenue per available room saw a modest, but encouraging, 4% increase over the year. On a per-share basis, that adjusted FFO result works out to $3.60, which is well above what Hospitality Properties Trust doles out in its dividend -- which, in calendar 2016, annualized to $2.03. The company has been on the market for more than 20 years, and in spite of some dips it's generally managed to improve its FFO over that time. I'd feel pretty safe with this payout. HPT Funds from Operations (TTM) data by YCharts Hospitality Properties trust will distribute its next dividend "on or about May 18," to shareholders of record as of April 21. The new payout would yield 6.5% on the REIT's latest closing stock price. Eric Volkman has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Qualcomm.

Check your detergent bengaluru Updated: Apr 21, 2017 11:04 IST Malavika Vyawahare Hindustan Times, New Delhi The foaming Bellandur lake has alarmed residents and environmentalists alike. (Kashif Masood / HT Photo) The frothing of a lake is not to be taken lightly. Realising this, the National Green Tribunal on Wednesday shut down all industries around Bellandur Lake and imposed a fine of Rs 5 lakh on anybody found dumping waste in or around the water body. This, however, was not some one-off freak show. Both Bellandur Lake and Varthur Lake, located in the outskirts of Bengaluru, have burst into froth on several occasions in the past decade. Industrial pollution is only a part of the problem. Undertreated sewage, all 500 million litres of it, flows into Bellandur Lake very day. And that brings us to one of the main reasons behind the lake frothing – detergents. India continues to use phosphate-infused detergents, although they have been banned in many other countries due to their polluting nature. While the government regulates the phosphate content in these consumer products (some would say poorly), it has shied away from completely banning it. TV Ramachandra, a professor at the Indian Institute of Science-Bangalore, says the problem can be tackled through public awareness and the imposition of a ban on certain kinds of detergents. The professor, who was part of an expert committee set up by the state government to look into frothing of lakes, said the ubiquity of washing machines in urban India and indiscriminate use of detergent by households have come together to turn Bellandur Lake into a foamy disaster. Incidentally, around 40% of 1,800 households surveyed in eastern Bengaluru (where the water body is located) were found to be using at least five kg of detergent in a month. Many of the popular detergents used in India contain high levels of phosphate, Ramachandra said, adding that “while some firms do make phosphate-free detergent, it is usually exported”. The detergent market in India is worth an estimated Rs 20,000 crore, and growing. The three major players in this arena are Hindustan Unilever (HUL), Procter & Gamble (P&G) and the RSPL Group – a domestic manufacturer that produces Ghari detergent. HUL, which owns Surf Excel, Rin and Wheel with a market share of nearly 40%, could not be contacted. P&G, the multinational behind Tide, had stopped selling phosphate-infused detergents in the US after an outcry over the degradation of water bodies in the early 1990s. Since 2015, the company has been doing the same in India too. To produce lather from hard water is – well – hard. Phosphates are used to soften hard water, enhancing the cleaning ability of the detergent. It was the availability of alternatives such as Zeolite, which manages to be environment-friendly without compromising on cleaning capacity, that allowed P&G to do away with phosphates altogether. Consumer Voice, a consumer action group, tested 14 popular brands dominating the Indian market in 2015. It found that detergents like Henko Matic, Henko Stain Champion, Super Nirma Blue and Uni Wash contain phosphate in the range of 3.2-5.4%, making them the least eco-friendly products of the lot. While Ariel Matic was adjudged to be almost phosphate-free, the other nine brands contained limited quantities of the compound. The numbers may vary, but it is clear that almost none of the detergents sold in India are devoid of phosphate. Not a single detergent brand displays the Ecomark label, which certifies a product as environment-friendly. While phosphorus serves as a nutrient for plants, too much of it can choke up water bodies through algal blooms. In the absence of sunlight, the algae start consuming dissolved oxygen in the water. When they die, the decomposition process uses up oxygen too. In extreme cases, this leads to the formation of dead zones where marine organisms cannot survive. There is another reason why using phosphate-free detergents may be a good idea. Phosphate, the mineral form of phosphorus, is a crucial resource that’s found only in limited quantities across the world. While the chemical is largely used in fertilisers, it can be substituted with other eco-friendly compounds in detergents. India, incidentally, is the largest importer of phosphorus compounds in the world. Former environment minister Prakash Javadekar had made some noises about making detergents phosphate-free in 2015, but nothing happened in the years that followed. tags Phosphate Detergent Bellandur Lake Bengaluru National Green Tribunal more from bengaluru Lawyers, activists seek Karnataka chief justice’s transfer over corruption charges Mar 31, 2017 23:38 IST SM Krishna to kick-start BJP career with campaign for bypolls in Karnataka Mar 25, 2017 01:01 IST Not a Drop to Waste- A Water Day Infographic Partnered Feature Recommended for you Read more Bengaluru’s ‘burning’ lake: NGT orders industries to be shut, imposes Rs 5 lakh fine Froth and fire: Bengaluru’s toxic lakes have been a decade in making India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Blogs Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper HT Indepth Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

A product liability lawsuit filed over the side effects of Nexium, Prilosec and Prevacid indicates that the manufacturers of the popular acid reflux drugs failed to warn consumers and the medical community that users may face an increased risk of experiencing a host of serious kidney injuries.  The complaint (PDF) was filed late last month by A’Lydia M. Gibbs, in the Superior Court of Delaware, naming AstraZeneca, Procter & Gamble, and Takeda Pharmaceuticals as defendants. Although the drug makers knew or should have known about the kidney risks with Nexium, Prilosec and Prevacid, Gibbs indicates that the drug makers withheld information about studies that suggest users may be more likely to develop an acute kidney injury, acute interstitial nephritis, chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal failure. Gibbs used the popular medications for an extended period of time in 2015, maintaining that she subsequently suffered a number of kidney problems that have left her permanently and severely injured. The drugs are some of the most widely used brand-name medications in the U.S., and are part of a larger class of acid reflux drugs known as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which also includes Protonix, Dexilant and others. The case joins dozens of other Nexium lawsuits, Prilosec lawsuits, Protonix lawsuits, Prevacid lawsuits and Dexilant lawsuits brought by individuals nationwide in recent months, each involving similar allegations that the drug makers withheld information about the risks associated with long-term use of the medications. Rather than warning doctors and informing consumers about the side effects, Gibbs indicates that the drug maker makers continued to maintain that the medications do not pose any risk of of kidney problems. The lawsuit notes that PPIs are one of the most commercially successful medication classes in the U.S., with sales of more than $50 billion from 2008 to 2013. “In spite of their commercial success and global popularity, up to 70% of PPIs may be used inappropriately for indications or durations that were never tested or approved, “Gibbs notes in her complaint. ” As a result of the defective nature of PPIs, even if used as directed by a physician or healthcare professional, persons who ingested PPIs have been exposed to significant risks stemming from unindicated and/or long-term usage.” Heartburn Drug Risks Since Nexium, Prilosec, Prevacid and other PPI drugs have lacked kidney warnings for years, they are widely believed to be safe by most consumers and doctors, and many individuals remain on the medications for years with little attempt to reduce use. However, a number of studies published in recent years have highlighted serious risks associated with use of the medications. In an independent study published by the medical journal CMAJ Open in April 2015, researchers found that users of PPI medications were 3 times more likely to suffer acute interstitial nephritis, which involves inflammation of the kidney. In addition, the study found that users were 2.5 times more likely to develop acute kidney injury, which involves an abrupt loss of kidney function. This research was followed by a study published last year in the medical journal JAMA Internal Medicine, which also found an increased risk of chronic kidney disease with the heartburn medications, indicating that users of Nexium, Prilosec and other PPI may be 50% more likely when compared to non-users. In April 2016, researchers with the Department of Veterans Affairs found that users of Nexium, Prilosec or other PPIs may be 96% more likely to develop renal failure and 28% more likely to develop chronic kidney disease after five years of use. In February, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation rejected a request to consolidate all federal proton pump inhibitor kidney damage lawsuits before one judge for pretrial proceedings, saying that the drugs were too dissimilar, and also direct competitors. Therefore, cases filed in U.S. District Courts nationwide are moving forward as individual claims, without coordinated discovery. In addition, many cases, like those filed by Gibbs, are filed at the state level, and are also moving forward as individual claims. As heartburn drug injury lawyers continue to review and file cases, it is expected that thousands of similar chronic kidney disease lawsuits and other claims over side effects of PPI medications could be filed in the coming months.

According to a new AdAge report, the move would be unilateral with the backing of an industry coalition and a possible “independent monitoring group.” Nintendo Switch The Coalition for Better Ads wants to improve the general browsing experience by getting rid of the worst ads as determined by users. This group is comprised of tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook, as well Procter & Gamble, Unilever, and other large brands. Additionally, publishers like Reuters and The Washington Post are included. In March, the coalition published finding based on interviewing 25,000 participants about 104 different types of ads. Unsurprisingly, the most hated include pop-ups, auto-playing video with sound, and “prestitial” ads with countdown timers. According to attorney Stu Ingis, the coalition’s counsel, the goal is to improve the browsing experience: The end game here is to remove these types of ads which are undercutting the consumer internet experience. Truthfully, those ads can potentially and seriously undercut the broader internet ecosystem. Ingis added that an “independent monitoring group” would ensure the ad-blocking technology “is doing what it is supposed to.” It also guarantees that “no one company is by themselves in setting or making determinations.” A “roadmap” will be completed in the coming weeks. Afterwards, the group will decide on what solution to pursue, with a final decision coming as early as September.

BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, Updated: April 20, 2017 2:19 pm Follow @AuroraSentinel DETROIT | General Motors has stopped doing business in Venezuela after authorities took control of its only factory there in what GM called an illegal judicial seizure of its assets. The plant was confiscated on Wednesday as anti-government protesters clashed with authorities in a country that is roiling in economic troubles such as food shortages and triple-digit inflation. The Detroit automaker said in a statement Thursday that other assets such as vehicles were taken from the plant, causing irreparable damage to the company. FILE - This Friday, May 16, 2014, file photo, shows the General Motors logo at the company's world headquarters in Detroit. General Motors says it has halted operations in Venezuela after authorities seized a factory. The plant was confiscated on Wednesday, April 19, 2017, in what GM called an illegal judicial seizure of its assets. GM says its due process rights were violated and it will take legal steps to fight the seizure. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya, File) It’s not the first time the Venezuelan government has seized a foreign corporation’s facilities. In July of last year, the government said it would take a factory belonging to Kimberly-Clark Corp. after the U.S. personal care giant said it was no longer possible to manufacture in the crisis-wracked nation due to a lack of materials. President Nicolas Maduro accused Kimberly-Clark of participating in an international plot to damage Venezuela’s economy and said his socialist government would provide public funds to the workers at the plant. Kimberly-Clark joined Bridgestone, General Mills, Procter & Gamble, Ford Motor Co. and other multinational corporations in scaling back operations in Venezuela. In March, a World Bank arbitration panel determined that Venezuela did not have to pay $1.4 billion to Exxon Mobil Corp. for confiscating company assets during a wave of nationalizations. GM says its plant was seized Wednesday in disregard of its right to due process. The company says it will defend itself legally and that it’s confident that justice eventually will prevail. GM has about 2,700 workers in the troubled country, where it’s been the market leader for over 35 years. It also has 79 dealers that employ 3,900 people, and its parts suppliers make up more than half of Venezuela’s auto parts market, the company said. GM, though, hasn’t produced a single car at its plant in the industrial city of Valencia since 2015. Like most carmakers in the oil-producing nation, it has seen production grind to a halt as the cash-strapped government chokes off its access to dollars needed to import parts and repatriate profits. Nationwide, car makers assembled just 2,849 cars last year, from a peak of 172,218 vehicles in 2007. Despite Venezuela’s grim outlook, many car makers have decided to stay put and avoid the drastic step of shutting down operations to avoid losing market share in case the economy dramatically improves or a more business-friendly government takes power. If the government permits it, GM workers at the Valencia plant will get separation benefits “arising from the termination of employment relationships due to causes beyond the parties’ control,” the GM statement said. Dealers will continue to service vehicles and provide parts, the company said. GM’s Venezuelan operations have been a drag on earnings for several years. In the second quarter of 2015, the company took a $720 million charge for currency devaluation and asset valuation write-downs as the economy faltered. South American operations, which include Venezuela, account for a relatively small portion of GM’s earnings and sales. Last year the company lost $400 million before taxes in South America, but as a whole the company made a pretax profit of $12.5 billion. GM sold just over 583,000 vehicles in the region last year, but that was only about 6 percent of its total sales. In its 2016 fourth-quarter earnings release, the company said that its South America region “remains challenged from macro-economic and political standpoints.” Shares of General Motors Co. rose 18 cents $33.97 in morning trading. Josh Goodman contributed to this report from Caracas.

Most Popular The biggest players in advertising and tech are mapping out a strategy to kill off the digital ads that have been deemed as the absolute worst by consumers. The most likely approach is the adoption of a "technology" -- the term "ad blocker" has baggage among many of the participants in talks on the subject -- that would prevent browsers such as Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge from displaying autoplaying video ads with sound, pop-up ads and ads that quickly flash or change colors. The discussions are taking place among members of the industry's Coalition for Better Ads, including Google, Microsoft, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, WPP's ad-buying giant GroupM, Facebook, Thomson Reuters, The Washington Post, the Interactive Advertising Bureau and the Association of National Advertisers, according to Stu Ingis, counsel to the coalition and attorney at Venable LLP. "The end game here is to remove these types of ads which are undercutting the consumer internet experience," Ingis said. "Truthfully, those ads can potentially and seriously undercut the broader internet ecosystem." A "blocking mechanism" or "technology" to prevent such ads from appearing will be put into place before the end of this year, Ingis predicted. Google said it does not comment on speculation, but said it's been working closely with the coalition for Better Ads and its members. The IAB declined to comment. GroupM, Facebook, Unilever and P&G could not immediately be reached for comment. Earlier this year, the Coalition for Better Ads paid some 25,000 participants in the U.S. and Europe to rate 104 different ad experiences on desktop and mobile. Their findings, released in March, revealed what many already know: Consumers don't like autoplay video ads with sound, pop-up ads and ads that quickly flash or change colors. Though the findings seemed obvious, the coalition was partly trying to create a ranking of sorts to inform its effort to stop the worst ads. An independent monitoring group would be required should the coalition decide on adopting ad blocking technology, Ingis said. "I don't see a scenario where there is a technology solution, but there isn't oversight," he said. "Oversight is needed to make sure the tech is doing what it is supposed to. Oversight is needed so no one company is by themselves in setting or making determinations." Ad blocking tech would elevate premium publishers that don't sell annoying ad formats and protect them from actors that will sell anything possible, Ingis said. Hamish Nicklin, chief revenue officer at the Guardian, said the idea was promising. "We welcome any initiative that helps to create an open web where the experience of readers is put first, and in which publishers like the Guardian -- which has long believed in a fewer, better approach to the ads we place across our products -- can prosper," Nicklin said. Questions about implementation remain though, he added. "While these developments will help to promote good formats, it's unclear how they will deal with the gaming of good formats, with bad dynamic creatives, which we have seen being served through mainstream programmatic exchanges," Nicklin said. As it stands right now, no solution has been adopted. In fact, the Coalition for Better Ads is still in the process of drawing up its roadmap, something it says will be complete within the coming weeks. From there, coalition board members will decide on what solution they will use to stop annoying ads from surfacing. That decision will likely come in September or by the end of this year, Ingis said. "What I would say is stay tuned, because I think as we really develop this, the consumer is going to see a rapidly improved ad experience," he said. "If the question is, 'Isn't this motivated by self-interest,' the answer is absolutely it is driven by self-interest." "The ad industry has a self-interest to make sure the ad supported internet that consumers love continues," he added. "The incentives of the ad industry, from my view, are exactly right. And they are perfectly aligned with what consumer interest would want." ~ ~ ~ CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article erroneously attributed information about the talks at the Coalition for Better ads to Chuck Curran, counsel to the coalition and attorney at Venable LLP.

Support every customer. Anytime. Anywhere. What is the Internet of Things and How Can It Grow My Business? By Matthew Chapman PUBLISHED: APRIL 20 2017 The term Internet of Things might sound disconcertingly vague, but it refers to something very specific: technological devices connected via the internet. The History Similar to other technological buzzwords such as 3D printing and electric cars, the technology behind the Internet of Things (IoT) has been in existence for decades but it is only in recent years the term has gained credence. There is some dispute as to who was responsible for coining the Internet of Things expression, and two men lay claim to it. Peter T. Lewis claims to have coined it in a speech given in 1985 at a Federal Communications Commission conference, whereas another story tells of Kevin Ashton inventing it in a presentation to Procter & Gamble execs in 1999. Lewis reportedly stated in his speech that the Internet of Things is the "integration of people, processes and technology with connectable devices and sensors to enable remote monitoring, status, manipulation and evaluation of trends." This is the same as today’s explanation of the Internet of Things. In its simplest terms IoT could be described as connecting physical objects to the internet through sensors in order to allow them to communicate with each other and harvest data. One of the first instances of what we would now define as an IoT device can be traced back to 1989 when John Romkey unveiled an internet connected toaster at a conference. Bernard Marr, founder and chief executive of the Advanced Performance Institute, says IoT will allow "every item we have [to] become a computer." "It started off with smartphones, then moved on to smartwatches and smart TVs and got to a stage where we now have basically everything [connected] from thermostats to clothing to shoes and chairs in the office," says Marr. Business Uses Marr has identified six tech trends poised to disrupt small business, including Internet of Things. He believes IoT can help small businesses in three particular areas: the improving of decision making, providing a better understanding of customers, and improving operations through the reduction of operating costs. The latter could include cutting energy bills through the use of smart thermostats such as Nest, while the first two are more strategic. One such example Marr provides of a strategic use of IoT is a butcher shop that installed sensors on its shopping window and inside the shop allowing it to pick up the signals emitted by smartphones’ Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections. At the time the butcher was facing a number of challenges including a drop in footfall due to a local library closing down, and the opening of a supermarket that was undercutting its prices. Through the introduction of the sensors the butcher was able to collect enough data to ascertain what marketing messages were attracting the most customers. Another business that is experimenting with IoT to improve its business operations is the on-demand laundry service Laundrapp, which allows customers to arrange laundry collections and deliveries online. Laundrapp has partnered with Amazon to develop functionality for its virtual assistant Alexa, which sits within the voice-controlled Amazon Echo internet-connected speaker. "It is by far the easiest way to place an order," says Laundrapp co-founder and chief executive Edward Relf. "Our business is entirely about convenience and saving people time and the fact you can order a Laundrapp just by saying two or three sentences is easily the most convenient way to order." Relf says he cannot divulge the amount of orders carried out through Alexa, but highlights how adopting a new technology can provide significant PR and marketing opportunities. "If you don’t have a huge marketing budget then actually being the first to some of these platforms represents a fantastic cross-marketing opportunity," says Relf. These can come in the form of appearing prominently on app stores, receiving media coverage for being at the cutting-edge of technology, and receiving promotion through partners’ such as Amazon’s marketing channels.

U.K. Wants WhatsApp 'Backdoor' Next Article > Tilted Device Could Pinpoint Pin Number for Hackers, Study Claims By Alex Hern PUBLISHED: APRIL 17 2017 Hackers could steal mobile phone users' pin numbers from the way their devices tilt as they type on them, researchers have claimed. Computer scientists at Newcastle University managed to guess a four-digit pin with 70% accuracy at the first attempt by using the gyroscopes built into all modern smartphones. With five attempts, the team was able to correctly guess the pin 100% of the time. The theoretical hack takes advantage of a loophole in how web browsers share data from a smartphone with websites that ask for it. While sensitive information such as location requires user permission, a malicious website can ask for, and be given, seemingly benign data such as device orientation without the user being notified. But users need not be too concerned about hackers breaking into their devices. The method behind the attack has significant hindrances that would prevent it from being used in the real world. Dr Maryam Mehrnezhad, a research fellow in the School of Computing Science, said: "Most smartphones, tablets, and other wearables are now equipped with a multitude of sensors, from the well-known GPS, camera and microphone to instruments such as the gyroscope, rotation sensors and accelerometer. "But because mobile apps and websites don't need to ask permission to access most of them, malicious programs can covertly 'listen in' on your sensor data and use it to discover a wide range of sensitive information about you, such as phone call timing, physical activities and even your touch actions, pins and passwords." Websites need to ask permission from users to access sensitive information, such as location data, or to access sensors such as the cameras or microphones on a device. But some information, such as the orientation of the device or the size of its screen, is considered non-sensitive and generally shared with any site that asks for it to enable interactivity and responsive webpages. Thankfully, to train the system to enough precision to be able to guess even a simple four-digit pin (and most smartphones require a six-digit, or longer, password), the researchers required a lot of data from users: each had to type 50 known pin numbers in, five times over, before it learned enough about how they hold their phones to guess a hidden pin with 70% accuracy. But with no uniform way of managing sensors across the industry, when research such as Mehrnezhad's shows flaws, it can be difficult for manufacturers to give a coordinated response. "Despite the very real risks, when we asked people which sensors they were most concerned about we found a direct correlation between perceived risk and understanding," she said. "So people were far more concerned about the camera and GPS than they were about the silent sensors." The team was able to identify 25 different sensors that came as standard on most smart devices and were used to give different information about the device and its user. The researchers found that each user touch action -- clicking, scrolling, holding and tapping -- induced a unique orientation and motion trace and so on a known webpage, the team was able to determine what part of the page the user was clicking on and what they were typing. They said they had alerted leading browser providers such as Google and Apple of the risks, but so far no one had been able to come up with an answer. The research is similar to a finding in 2015 that a then-new tool for reporting battery status to websites, intended to allow webmasters to offer a low-power version of their site for users with little power left, was capable of being abused to track a user across apps, sites and private browsing modes. Although only theoretically possible when first reported in 2015, by 2016 user tracking firms were using it in the real world, which prompted Firefox to disable the feature entirely by the end of last year. In 2014, hackers at the Chaos Communications Congress in Hamburg demonstrated the "corneal keylogger," a system allowing them to extract information such as pin codes from only a video of the victim's eye as they enter the data. © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Support every customer. Anytime. Anywhere. What is the Internet of Things and How Can It Grow My Business? By Matthew Chapman PUBLISHED: APRIL 20 2017 The term Internet of Things might sound disconcertingly vague, but it refers to something very specific: technological devices connected via the internet. The History Similar to other technological buzzwords such as 3D printing and electric cars, the technology behind the Internet of Things (IoT) has been in existence for decades but it is only in recent years the term has gained credence. There is some dispute as to who was responsible for coining the Internet of Things expression, and two men lay claim to it. Peter T. Lewis claims to have coined it in a speech given in 1985 at a Federal Communications Commission conference, whereas another story tells of Kevin Ashton inventing it in a presentation to Procter & Gamble execs in 1999. Lewis reportedly stated in his speech that the Internet of Things is the "integration of people, processes and technology with connectable devices and sensors to enable remote monitoring, status, manipulation and evaluation of trends." This is the same as today’s explanation of the Internet of Things. In its simplest terms IoT could be described as connecting physical objects to the internet through sensors in order to allow them to communicate with each other and harvest data. One of the first instances of what we would now define as an IoT device can be traced back to 1989 when John Romkey unveiled an internet connected toaster at a conference. Bernard Marr, founder and chief executive of the Advanced Performance Institute, says IoT will allow "every item we have [to] become a computer." "It started off with smartphones, then moved on to smartwatches and smart TVs and got to a stage where we now have basically everything [connected] from thermostats to clothing to shoes and chairs in the office," says Marr. Business Uses Marr has identified six tech trends poised to disrupt small business, including Internet of Things. He believes IoT can help small businesses in three particular areas: the improving of decision making, providing a better understanding of customers, and improving operations through the reduction of operating costs. The latter could include cutting energy bills through the use of smart thermostats such as Nest, while the first two are more strategic. One such example Marr provides of a strategic use of IoT is a butcher shop that installed sensors on its shopping window and inside the shop allowing it to pick up the signals emitted by smartphones’ Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections. At the time the butcher was facing a number of challenges including a drop in footfall due to a local library closing down, and the opening of a supermarket that was undercutting its prices. Through the introduction of the sensors the butcher was able to collect enough data to ascertain what marketing messages were attracting the most customers. Another business that is experimenting with IoT to improve its business operations is the on-demand laundry service Laundrapp, which allows customers to arrange laundry collections and deliveries online. Laundrapp has partnered with Amazon to develop functionality for its virtual assistant Alexa, which sits within the voice-controlled Amazon Echo internet-connected speaker. "It is by far the easiest way to place an order," says Laundrapp co-founder and chief executive Edward Relf. "Our business is entirely about convenience and saving people time and the fact you can order a Laundrapp just by saying two or three sentences is easily the most convenient way to order." Relf says he cannot divulge the amount of orders carried out through Alexa, but highlights how adopting a new technology can provide significant PR and marketing opportunities. "If you don’t have a huge marketing budget then actually being the first to some of these platforms represents a fantastic cross-marketing opportunity," says Relf. These can come in the form of appearing prominently on app stores, receiving media coverage for being at the cutting-edge of technology, and receiving promotion through partners’ such as Amazon’s marketing channels. "I’m not a huge fan of jumping onto new technology for the sake of it," adds Relf. "There were a number of platforms where we made the decision not to take Laundrapp to those platforms just because they are still unproven and don’t have the user base." Barriers of entries are falling down, meaning small businesses are able to prototype sophisticated electronics products.

Next Article > Toyota Shows Robotic Leg Brace To Help Paralyzed People Walk By Yuri Kageyama PUBLISHED: APRIL 14 2017 Toyota is introducing a wearable robotic leg brace designed to help partially paralyzed people walk. The Welwalk WW-1000 system [pictured above] is made up of a motorized mechanical frame that fits on a person's leg from the knee down. The patients can practice walking wearing the robotic device on a special treadmill that can support their weight. Toyota Motor Corp. demonstrated the equipment for reporters at its Tokyo headquarters on Wednesday. One hundred such systems will be rented to medical facilities in Japan later this year, Toyota said. The service entails a one-time initial charge of 1 million yen ($9,000) and a 350,000 yen ($3,200) monthly fee. The gadget is designed to be worn on one leg at a time for patients severely paralyzed on one side of the body due to a stroke or other ailments. The gadget is designed to be worn on one leg at a time for patients severely paralyzed on one side of the body due to a stroke or other ailments, Eiichi Saito, a medical doctor and executive vice president at Fujita Health University, explained. The university joined with Toyota in developing the device. A person demonstrating it strapped the brace to her thigh, knee, ankle and foot and then showed how it is used to practice walking on the treadmill. Her body was supported from above by a harness and the motor helped to bend and straighten her knee. Sensors in the device monitor the walking and adjust quickly to help out. Medical staff control the system through a touch panel screen. Japanese automakers have been developing robotics both for manufacturing and other uses. Honda Motor Co.'s Asimo humanoid can run and dance, pour a drink and carry on simple conversations, while WelWalk is more of a system that uses robotics than a stand-alone robot. Given how common paralysis due to strokes is in fast-aging Japan, Toyota's device could be very helpful, Saito said. He said patients using it can recover more quickly as the sensitive robotic sensor in Welwalk fine-tunes the level of support better than a human therapist can. "This helps just barely enough," said Saito, explaining that helping too much can slow progress in rehabilitation. The field of robotic aids for walking and rehabilitation is growing quickly. A battery-powered wearable exoskeleton made by Israeli manufacturer ReWalk Robotics enables people relying on a wheelchair to stand upright and walk. Such systems also can aid therapists in monitoring a patient's progress, Luke Hares, chief technology officer at Cambridge Medical Robotics in Britain, said in a phone interview. "They can be so much more precise," he said. Previously, Toyota has shown robots that play the violin and trumpet. It plans to start sales in Japan of a tiny boy-like robot for conversational companionship. It is also investing in artificial intelligence and developing self-driving vehicles. Toshiyuki Isobe, Toyota's chief officer for research, said Welwalk reflects the company's desire to apply robotics in medicine and other social welfare areas, not just entertainment. The company also has an R2-D2-like machine, called the Human Support Robot, whose mechanical arm can help bed-ridden people pick things up. "Our vision is about trying to deliver mobility for everybody," said Isobe. "We have been developing industrial robotics for auto manufacturing, and we are trying to figure out how we can use that technology to fill social needs and help people more." © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

GM said Thursday that its only factory in Venezuela was confiscated a day earlier, as anti-government protesters clashed with authorities in a country that is roiled by economic troubles. GM said assets such as vehicles were taken from the plant, causing the company irreparable damage. The seizure is the latest in a long string of government confiscations of factories and other assets that have been a staple of the so-called 21st century socialist revolution in Venezuela started by the late Hugo Chavez two decades ago. Venezuela is currently fighting claims of illegal asset seizures at a World Bank-sponsored arbitration panel from more than 25 companies. GM vowed to defend itself legally but getting compensated could be difficult. Under Chavez, Venezuela seized some Exxon Mobil assets. The oil giant sought compensation of $16.6 billion. The company won a $1.4 billion judgment, but earlier this year the arbitration panel determined that Venezuela had to pay only $180 million. GM can seek compensation and damages for its lost plant in several different international venues, said Nigel Blackaby, a lawyer at the Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer law firm, which has battled Venezuela in several high-profile cases in international courts. The venue depends on what treaties, if any, govern the investment, he said. While Exxon's case was heard by the World Bank panel, Freshfields has successfully pursued claims against Venezuela's government before a United Nations panel. The Venezuelan government had no comment about the GM factory. Auto production in Venezuela has nearly ground to a halt amid the country's economic collapse. The cash-strapped government has choked off car companies' access to dollars needed to import parts and repatriate profits. GM's factory in the industrial city of Valencia did not produce a single vehicle last year. Nationwide, car makers assembled just 2,849 cars in 2016, from a peak of 172,218 in 2007. Still, many car makers have stayed put in case the economy experiences a turnaround. GM has about 2,700 workers in Venezuela, where it's been the market leader for over 35 years. It also has 79 dealers that employ 3,900 people. The factory seizure arose from an almost 20-year-old lawsuit brought by a former GM dealership in western Venezuela. The dealership had been seeking damages from GM of 476 million bolivars - about $665 million at the official exchange rate, but just $115 million on the black market where many Venezuelans are forced to turn to sell their increasingly worthless currency. GM said it was notified this week that a low-level court ordered an embargo of its plant, bank accounts and other assets in the country. Hundreds of workers desperate for information about their jobs gathered at the plant on Thursday to meet with government and military officials, as well as representatives of the dealership that brought the lawsuit. In Washington, the State Department said in a statement that it was reviewing details of the factory seizure and called on Venezuelan authorities to resolve the case "rapidly and transparently." The statement said a fair judicial system is critical to economic reforms that would restore growth, but it made no mention of any action the U.S. government might take. In July of last year, the Venezuelan government took control of a factory belonging to Kimberly-Clark Corp. after the U.S. personal care giant said it was no longer possible to manufacture in the crisis-wracked nation due to a lack of materials. President Nicolas Maduro accused Kimberly-Clark of participating in an international plot to damage Venezuela's economy. In recent years, Bridgestone, General Mills, Procter & Gamble, Ford Motor Co. and other multinational corporations have also scaled back operations in Venezuela. Ford suspended operations at its Valencia plant in December due to slumping sales. Toyota said its lone factory in Cumana, Venezuela, continues to operate normally. GM's Venezuelan operations have been a drag on earnings for several years. In the second quarter of 2015, the company took a $720 million charge for currency devaluation and asset valuation write-downs as the economy faltered. South American operations, which include Venezuela, account for about 6 percent GM's total sales. Last year, GM lost $400 million before taxes in South America, but overall it made a pretax profit of $12.5 billion. Shares of General Motors Co. rose 31 cents to close at $34.10. ___ Goodman reported from Caracas. Dee-Ann Durbin in Detroit and Christopher Rugaber in Washington contributed to this report.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 20 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman How Business Can Lead Sustainable Growth Now is the time for companies to set the tone on sustainability leadership. SOURCE: UPS DESCRIPTION: Tamara Barker | UPS Today the private sector is uniquely positioned to step forward and assume a higher level of sustainability leadership. The changing policy landscape around the world presents an opportunity for companies to create a consumer-driven marketplace that is better for the environment and better for business. Companies and brands that have engaged consumers with innovative sustainability initiatives – from P&G shampoo bottles made from recycled plastic to the green bonds issued by Starbucks – have built goodwill and improved their bottom line. We have seen first-hand at UPS how sustainability investments grow our business. UPS has more than 8,100 alternative-fuel and advanced-technology vehicles, which reduce our environmental footprint and allow us to explore promising new energy sources. Through our proprietary ORION navigation system, we’re able to find the most efficient routes for our deliveries, reducing fuel use and emissions. Such investments happen only with support from a company’s senior leaders, and we are proud to be among those working for a more sustainable future. Gaining that support in your own company and building the right business case for sustainability takes time. Here are four proven examples that can lead to better results: 1. Explore Alternative Fuel and Energy Prices have dropped on many alternative energy sources, including solar and electric. Size and scale for any large operation remain a challenge – alternative fuels in heavy-duty vehicles is a prime example. But when making sustainable change, energy is a good place to start. 2. Optimize Supply Chains The most sustainable mile is the one you or your goods never travel. A thorough examination and optimization of supply chains can lead to efficiencies, both for the environment and your profit margin. 3. Embrace Technology Technology and big data allow companies to scrutinize, analyze and optimize every inch of their operation. With more insight on daily activities, you can make smarter decisions about fuel and energy usage. 4. Get Employees Involved Your people are often the first to uncover innovative practices. If you give employees new opportunities, it leads to better decisions and a more sustainable workplace. Celebrate and reward creative thinking, and you may find that your most sustainable assets are the ones you had all along. These are just some of the ways we can chart a new course for our businesses. With Earth Day around the corner, there’s no better time than now to begin striving for a more sustainable future. Tamara Barker is UPS Chief Sustainability Officer and Vice President of Environmental Affairs.

By Tom Krisher, Associated Press Published Thursday, April 20, 2017 | 8 a.m. Updated Thursday, April 20, 2017 | 8:13 a.m. DETROIT — General Motors has stopped doing business in Venezuela after authorities took control of its only factory there in what GM called an illegal judicial seizure of its assets. The plant was confiscated on Wednesday as anti-government protesters clashed with authorities in a country that is roiling in economic troubles such as food shortages and triple-digit inflation. The Detroit automaker said in a statement Thursday that other assets such as vehicles were taken from the plant, causing irreparable damage to the company. It's not the first time the Venezuelan government has seized a foreign corporation's facilities. In July of last year, the government said it would take a factory belonging to Kimberly-Clark Corp. after the U.S. personal care giant said it was no longer possible to manufacture in the crisis-wracked nation due to a lack of materials. President Nicolas Maduro accused Kimberly-Clark of participating in an international plot to damage Venezuela's economy and said his socialist government would provide public funds to the workers at the plant. Kimberly-Clark joined Bridgestone, General Mills, Procter & Gamble, Ford Motor Co. and other multinational corporations in scaling back operations in Venezuela. In March, a World Bank arbitration panel determined that Venezuela did not have to pay $1.4 billion to Exxon Mobil Corp. for confiscating company assets during a wave of nationalizations. GM says its plant was seized Wednesday in disregard of its right to due process. The company says it will defend itself legally and that it's confident that justice eventually will prevail. GM has about 2,700 workers in the troubled country, where it's been the market leader for over 35 years. It also has 79 dealers that employ 3,900 people, and its parts suppliers make up more than half of Venezuela's auto parts market, the company said. GM, though, hasn't produced a single car at its plant in the industrial city of Valencia since 2015. Like most carmakers in the oil-producing nation, it has seen production grind to a halt as the cash-strapped government chokes off its access to dollars needed to import parts and repatriate profits. Nationwide, car makers assembled just 2,849 cars last year, from a peak of 172,218 vehicles in 2007. Despite Venezuela's grim outlook, many car makers have decided to stay put and avoid the drastic step of shutting down operations to avoid losing market share in case the economy dramatically improves or a more business-friendly government takes power. If the government permits it, GM workers at the Valencia plant will get separation benefits "arising from the termination of employment relationships due to causes beyond the parties' control," the GM statement said. Dealers will continue to service vehicles and provide parts, the company said. GM's Venezuelan operations have been a drag on earnings for several years. In the second quarter of 2015, the company took a $720 million charge for currency devaluation and asset valuation write-downs as the economy faltered. South American operations, which include Venezuela, account for a relatively small portion of GM's earnings and sales. Last year the company lost $400 million before taxes in South America, but as a whole the company made a pretax profit of $12.5 billion. GM sold just over 583,000 vehicles in the region last year, but that was only about 6 percent of its total sales. In its 2016 fourth-quarter earnings release, the company said that its South America region "remains challenged from macro-economic and political standpoints." Shares of General Motors Co. rose 18 cents $33.97 in morning trading. Josh Goodman contributed to this report from Caracas.

GM said Thursday that its only factory in Venezuela was confiscated a day earlier, as anti-government protesters clashed with authorities in a country that is roiled by economic troubles. GM said assets such as vehicles were taken from the plant, causing the company irreparable damage. The seizure is the latest in a long string of government confiscations of factories and other assets that have been a staple of the so-called 21st century socialist revolution in Venezuela started by the late Hugo Chavez two decades ago. Venezuela is currently fighting claims of illegal asset seizures at a World Bank-sponsored arbitration panel from more than 25 companies. GM vowed to defend itself legally but getting compensated could be difficult. Under Chavez, Venezuela seized some Exxon Mobil assets. The oil giant sought compensation of $16.6 billion. The company won a $1.4 billion judgment, but earlier this year the arbitration panel determined that Venezuela had to pay only $180 million. GM can seek compensation and damages for its lost plant in several different international venues, said Nigel Blackaby, a lawyer at the Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer law firm, which has battled Venezuela in several high-profile cases in international courts. The venue depends on what treaties, if any, govern the investment, he said. While Exxon's case was heard by the World Bank panel, Freshfields has successfully pursued claims against Venezuela's government before a United Nations panel. The Venezuelan government had no comment about the GM factory. Auto production in Venezuela has nearly ground to a halt amid the country's economic collapse. The cash-strapped government has choked off car companies' access to dollars needed to import parts and repatriate profits. GM's factory in the industrial city of Valencia did not produce a single vehicle last year. Nationwide, car makers assembled just 2,849 cars in 2016, from a peak of 172,218 in 2007. Still, many car makers have stayed put in case the economy experiences a turnaround. GM has about 2,700 workers in Venezuela, where it's been the market leader for over 35 years. It also has 79 dealers that employ 3,900 people. The factory seizure arose from an almost 20-year-old lawsuit brought by a former GM dealership in western Venezuela. The dealership had been seeking damages from GM of 476 million bolivars — about $665 million at the official exchange rate, but just $115 million on the black market where many Venezuelans are forced to turn to sell their increasingly worthless currency. GM said it was notified this week that a low-level court ordered an embargo of its plant, bank accounts and other assets in the country. Hundreds of workers desperate for information about their jobs gathered at the plant on Thursday to meet with government and military officials, as well as representatives of the dealership that brought the lawsuit. In Washington, the State Department said in a statement that it was reviewing details of the factory seizure and called on Venezuelan authorities to resolve the case "rapidly and transparently." The statement said a fair judicial system is critical to economic reforms that would restore growth, but it made no mention of any action the U.S. government might take. In July of last year, the Venezuelan government took control of a factory belonging to Kimberly-Clark Corp. after the U.S. personal care giant said it was no longer possible to manufacture in the crisis-wracked nation due to a lack of materials.

Picture PA Wire. Norfolk MP Sir Henry Bellingham was encouraged to buy flowers for his wife after showing MPs her anti-wrinkle, anti-ageing lotion in the House of Commons. Share Email this article to a friend To send a link to this page you must be logged in. MPs jokingly labelled the North West Norfolk MP’s revelation as “outrageous” and “disgraceful” after he noted he found the product while “rummaging” through his wife’s collection of shampoos. Environment minister and Suffolk Coastal MP Therese Coffey described Sir Henry’s wife as a “flawless picture” and suggested he considers sorting out flowers as a way of making up for his comments. Sir Henry made the remark as he encouraged ministers to urge manufacturer Procter & Gamble to remove the “completely outrageous” Olay product from shops due to the environmental damage caused by microbeads within it. He told Ms Coffey: “I was recently rummaging through my wife’s collection of shampoos and to my horror I found a plastic container of Olay anti-wrinkle, anti-ageing lotion.” MPs could be heard teasing Sir Henry for his admission. He added: “(It was) complete with exfoliating microbeads. “Obviously, neither the secretary of state (Andrea Leadsom) nor her minister would ever have such need for the use of such a product. “But will she get on the telephone to the chief executive of Procter & Gamble and tell him that selling this sort of product is completely outrageous and should be withdrawn from the market at once?” Ms Coffey replied: “What I find extraordinary is that Lady Bellingham is a flawless picture and would even need these products, so I’m sure that my honourable friend will be buying flowers later today to make up for this. “It’s fair to say that we are working with manufacturers now and a lot of them are starting to remove these products pro-actively. That’s good news, but we want to make sure this avoidable pollution is taken out of our environment permanently.” Keywords: Henry Bellingham West Norfolk MP House of Commons Share Email this article to a friend To send a link to this page you must be logged in.

For some, that will translate into a more basic shift in attitude, with continued service at an existing company or a long-standing industry. For others, however, it may manifest in sheer economic disruption. Indeed, from Appalachia to Minnesota, churches are increasing their focus not only on the glories of work in general, but of innovation, entrepreneurship and capital investment, calling on congregants not just to serve and create where they already are, but to disrupt old systems, contribute new ideas and start new enterprises. At Crossroads, an evangelical church in Cincinnati, Ohio, such efforts have grown to tremendous scale, resulting in an annual conference, an intensive start-up competition and various off-shoot investment firms. In an extended profile at Bloomberg, Mya Frazier highlights the church's unique history, as well as its plans for fueling new businesses. The church began in 1990 as a Bible study among some key business leaders at Procter & Gamble Co., the massive consumer goods conglomerate (which is headquartered in downtown Cincinnati). The group soon grew to 100 people, and by 1996, the church held its first official service. Today, with roughly 30,000 congregants and an annual operating budget of $33 million, the church has managed to retained its heartbeat for entrepreneurship and calling to business. "A business endeavor is close to the heart of God and every bit as important as anything else on God's green earth," says Brian Tome, Crossroads' senior pastor. "God's placed a seed in you," he explains elsewhere, "and he wants to see it come to fruitfulness. ... the right seed that will bring forth the right fruit at the right time in every business." That basic theological orientation is carried through a range of teachings, church activities and institutional enterprises. Through its annual Unpolished conference, the church aims to offer a "home base for faith and business" and to "engage, energize and inspire the entrepreneurial spirit." In addition to hosting speakers and training sessions, the conference includes a highly funded pitch contest, in which entrepreneurs compete for investor capital, as well as a spot in the church's business accelerator program. The program consists of Ocean Capital, a "for-profit angel-investment wing," and Ocean Accelerator Inc., a non-profit designed to equip entrepreneurs to "increase God's presence in the marketplace." Led by Scott Weiss, a retired CEO who now volunteers his time, Ocean offers entrepreneurs a training ground for ministry through innovation, weaving business mentorship with Bible-based discipleship. "Our core approach is developing the capability and training them to raise money," says Weiss. "If you are a Christian and you want to produce in your faith, Ocean teaches you how to raise money in a Christian way, and that there's got to be an ethical standard to doing that. We teach them to pick your investors with care and to be very careful, because you are going to be married a very long time." Crossroads is not alone among churches in its prioritization of entrepreneurship, but they do stand apart in their more open advocacy of business in general. While many churches put a specific emphasis on so-called "social entrepreneurship," Crossroads recognizes the social value of any business that meets a human need. Further, amid the church's energetic emphasis on financial fundraising and investment, their underlying theology has not diluted into a false gospel of mere material prosperity. Instead, they've kept a careful focus on business as creative service for the love of neighbor and the glory of God. <a href="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=6421ee36eb&cb=733783881" ><img src="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873539&cs=6421ee36eb&cb=733783881" border="0" alt=""></a> advertisement For Todd Henry, one of the church's longtime members and start-up advisors, the Christian call to innovation is not ultimately about wealth, or even the services or gadgets they develop along the way. At a more fundamental level, it's about co-creation with the Father: We have this ability, Henry says, "to co-create new things, to partner with God in transforming creation." He points out that pattern recognition is crucial for a successful startup, as is understanding what he terms the law of the harvest: "Many of us, especially as entrepreneurs, we live in perpetual harvest mode, constantly trying to reap gain, and some of that is because our investors are telling us, 'We want to see a return,' " he says. "The problem is when you are living in perpetual harvest mode, you aren't taking the time to go back and plant seeds and cultivate seeds." He calls on the entrepreneurs to see God as the source of wisdom and Jesus as a brilliant thinker with a "deep systematic understanding of life," skilled in the practice of pattern recognition. Rather than pursuing business as a path to material comfort, Crossroads promotes an approach that embraces constant risk-taking, active obedience and vulnerability. Indeed, at a very basic level and in so many ways, the life of the entrepreneur reflects much of what the Christian life is all about: discerning and responding, serving and creating, building and exploring. "I feel like now, even more so than before, I'm having to submit to God's will, because it's getting bigger and bigger," says Lyden Foust, a 2015 Crossroads finalist, whose business idea is finally coming to fruition. "You think when you raise a bunch of money, you'd become more confident, but that's not the case. It gets harder." The difficult path of entrepreneurship serves as a strong buffer against the idols of convenience and comfortability that increasingly dominate modern life, and the underlying drivers ought to serve as a basic orientation and inspiration for all that we do, whether in our churches, "steadier" jobs, families, political witness or in the deeper workings of our spiritual lives. As Charlie Self puts it in his book Flourishing Churches and Communities, "Local churches are 'base camps' for launching 'cultural entrepreneurs,' who are connective tissue between faith and economics, charity and outreach, evangelization and improvement of the world." This is the opportunity we have. Those of us working in more "stable" businesses or industries can surely wield our own variety of risk-taking and creative activity, but in its own unique way, Crossroads offers a bold challenge on the types of frontiers the church has yet to pursue. As we survey the untapped avenues in our own churches and communities, we'd do well to ask ourselves, as Frazier does, "What might Jesus disrupt?"

Revenue in the January-March period amounted to EUR2.33 billion euros ($2.49 billion), reflecting an underlying drop of 1.2% compared with the same period a year earlier. Analysts had expected an even bigger decline of 1.8% after the losses of media business from Procter & Gamble Co., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and other key advertisers sapped sales growth at the company. The drop in organic revenue--a closely watched figure in the ad industry that strips out acquisitions, disposals and currency swings--came mainly from North America where the company posted a 5% decline. Publicis Chief Executive Maurice Lévy said underlying sales in the second quarter would again be negative, but show an improvement compared with the first quarter. He added that the figure would turn positive and grow in line with the advertising market during the second half of the year. "Our first quarter figures send out faint but encouraging signals as to the group's situation," he said. Mr. Levy, who has led Publicis for 30 years, is stepping down in June to be replaced by Arthur Sadoun, the advertising giant's 45-year-old creative chief. The change at the helm comes as Publicis is putting the finishing touches to a transformation process that it launched just over a year ago to foster greater collaboration between its myriad agencies.

Tags makeup animal testing Asia In China, big cosmetics firms are selling products tested on animals China Daily/ANN | Sophia Yan | Thursday, Apr 20, 2017 "And we have to explain it's because we really don't want to torture some bunnies." Photo: Reuters Sophia Yan China Daily/ANN Thursday, Apr 20, 2017 When entrepreneur Phoebe Song launched her organic, vegan skincare line, she had big plans to sell around the world, including in China, the world's largest consumer market. But she stopped cold after learning that the Chinese government mandated animal testing for imported cosmetics and skincare products. "As a vegan brand, we are really not cool with animals getting sprayed in the face," said Song, who owns Snow Fox Skincare. "It sucks, because China is a huge market … it's a lot of money. China requires skincare and cosmetics firms to submit to compulsory animal testing in government labs before regulators approve products for sale in the country. For brands like Song's Snow Fox, these regulations mean either allowing animal testing, or losing access to a market worth US$29 billion (S$40 billion) last year, according to Euromonitor. Experts say all firms selling to Chinese consumers now undergo animal testing for their products, including major foreign brands L'Oreal, Estee Lauder, Shiseido, and Proctor & Gamble. None of those firms, among the top foreign cosmetics and skincare companies selling in China, responded to a request for comment. Those companies state online that they do not engage in animal testing, but insert language that indicates exceptions are made where required. For instance, Estee Lauder says it "does not test on animals and we never ask others to do so on our behalf," according to a statement on its website. "If a regulatory body demands it for its safety or regulatory assessment, an exception can be made." A 2013 estimate by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals found that China's mandatory regulations resulted in companies testing products on as many as 300,000 animals, according to the organisation's senior vice president, Kathy Guillermo, who explained that an animal is killed after a test. While there are alternative ways of testing the safety of beauty products, for instance, by using 3-D tissue models, experts said China currently lacks the know-how. "They're just completely behind the curve in learning about the new science," said Erin Hill, president of US-based Institute of In Vitro Sciences, which is training Chinese government scientists in new methods. IIVS also partners with companies, including foreign brands in China, to work on non-animal testing procedures. Some change is happening: Late last year, the government moved to accept safety data collected through a non-animal test method, the 3T3 phototoxicity assay, which measures the safety of a chemical after exposure to light. The government hasn't said if this test is yet in use. And in some provinces, companies domestically manufacturing ordinary products, like lotion and soap, can now apply to waive the animal testing requirements. L'Oreal is one of the firms taking advantage of this, and some of its products, such as shampoo and body wash, are no longer animal tested in China, according to its website. But China's murky regulatory environment is difficult to navigate and experts said getting such approvals can be spotty. "It's a big task to make this shift - it comes down to having the right laboratories, the people skilled in these different methods, and also access to the equipment and the supplies you need," Hill said. Pressure is increasing for China to adapt, as animal testing gets banned in more jurisdictions, including Europe, Australia, India and Israel. In the US, it has long been abandoned from standard practice. Plus, if domestic Chinese firms want to sell abroad - especially in countries where such testing is no longer allowed - they'll need to substantiate the safety of their products via non-animal methods. National regulator China Food and Drug Administration didn't respond to a request for comment. For Hong Kong-based Song, she's simply decided not to sell her vegan products in China at the moment, despite the market potential. But sticking it out means sometimes, consumers don't cut her much slack. "They say, 'you're supposed to be a big global brand - what global brand doesn't have sales channels in China?" Song said. "And we have to explain it's because we really don't want to torture some bunnies." Sign up for our e-newsletter now! Get all the latest news, lifestyle and trending stories, delivered to your inbox!

The ad’s storyline pushes the issue of transgender rights within the country and reveals the human side of the issue in just three and a half minutes. Released online on March 31, the commercial by medicine company Vicks tells the true story of Gayatri, a young Indian orphan who was adopted by Gauri Sawant, a 37-year-old Mumbai-based transgender woman and social activist. On a bus on her way to boarding school, Gayatri recalls her life and how she was adopted by Sawant after her birth mother was taken away in an ambulance, never coming back. Throughout the ad, we catch glimpses of Sawant but she is only revealed in full when Gayatri turns to her and says, “This is my mom. Isn’t she lovely?” Gayatri says Sawant sends her to boarding school because she wants her to become a doctor. But in the final scene, Gayatri says she would rather become a lawyer, suggesting she would rather fight for the rights that her mother is denied as a transgender Indian. Trans people cannot legally adopt children in India. A non-traditional family The commercial features the real Gayatri and Gauri Sawant. Gayatri was 6 years old when her mother, a sex worker, died of AIDS. Gauri, her mother’s friend, decided to raise her as her own and is doing it “against all odds,” the advert states as she is unable to legally adopt the child herself. Commenting online, the ad’s director Neeraj Ghaywan was keen to point out that Sawant plays herself in the commercial. “Just hoping someday the world will be as one,” he wrote. In a statement, Nitin Darbari, a spokesman for Vicks’ parent company, Procter and Gamble, said the company was hoping to highlight “the importance of care beyond just the traditional perception of family.” “The campaign shows how people who, though not connected by blood, end up being family through care itself,” Darbari said. The video forms part of the company’s #TouchOfCare campaign and since its release online, has had an overwhelming number of comments, with the majority being positive. Similar views have been shared on Twitter. Politician Shashi Tharoor, who had been at the forefront of a now rejected bill that sought to decriminalize gay sex, tweeted his support of the ad’s messaging. But actress, artist and transgender rights activist Kalki Subramaniam has mixed views. While she can see it from the public’s perspective, as an activist she questions the benefit the ad will have on transgender communities. “Yes, this ad promotes transgender rights, our rights as mothers, our rights in social and civil activities, and our right as a citizen but the one thing I don’t like about this ad is that it sensationalizes an issue,” Subramaniam told CNN. “This is a trend in India. People are using transgender people because it gets a lot of attention but the community is still begging and doing sex work. What are they giving back to the community?” she asked. Limited progress to date India’s transgender community, known as “hijras,” can date their origins as far back as 3,000 years ago with mentions in the Hindu epics “Mahabharata” and “Ramayana.” During the Mughal Empire, which ruled the Indian subcontinent between 1526 and 1858, they are believed to have held significant power, serving as royal advisers and protectors of royal harems. Their status deteriorated rapidly however during the British empire. In a paper, Dr M. Michelraj from Annamalai University in India wrote that the British “vigorously sought to criminalize the hijra community and to deny them their civil rights.” The legacy of this stigmatization lingered and the community continued to face discrimination after independence, often being pushed to the edges of society and forced to depend on sex work to get by. But in recent years, India has made strides when it comes to transgender rights. In a landmark vote in 2014, India’s Supreme Court granted the country’s “hijra,” or transgender people, and those classified as third-gender the right to self-identify without sex reassignment surgery. It is one of 20 countries that has passed some form of legislation recognizing their status. The ruling in India enabled transgender people equal access to education, health care and employment, as well as protection from discrimination, with Sawant being one of the original petitioners to challenge the government, resulting in the passage of the law. “India is very progressive. A person can choose his or her gender, you don’t need to have a medical certificate. This speaks of our constitutional morality and recognizes gender politics,” said Akkai Padmashali, a transgender activist and founder of Ondede, a Bangalore-based NGO that works with the LGBT community. But transgender people — along with same-sex couples — still cannot legally adopt children in India. Subramaniam believes change comes slowly. “Passing a law doesn’t change society overnight … the government, the public, the activists need to work together to promote transgender rights and equality,” said Subramaniam. For Padmashali, the Vicks advert is a small step in stirring debate on this issue and bringing it to a wider audience. “The transgender community has been socially excluded for so many centuries,” she said. “(The advert) shows society that we are human beings. To adopt or to have a child is beyond your gender or sexuality. Gauri Sawant’s life story is a model for society.” Secretary Tom Price wants to fix US healthcare How prisons keep their suicidal inmates on watch Related Posts They thought he was fat, but he had a 130-lb. tumor Rugby Union: England handles Scotland in opening of Six Nations Barbershop quartets deliver love notes on Valentine’s Day Smithers comes out on ‘The Simpsons’ Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

GM said Thursday that its only factory in Venezuela was confiscated a day earlier, as anti-government protesters clashed with authorities in a country that is roiled by economic troubles. GM said assets such as vehicles were taken from the plant, causing it irreparable damage. The seizure is the latest in a long string of government confiscations of factories and other assets that have been a staple of the so-called 21st century socialist revolution in Venezuela started by the late Hugo Chavez two decades ago. Venezuela is currently fighting claims of illegal asset seizures at a World Bank-sponsored arbitration panel from more than 25 companies, making it one of the most-frequently targeted nations in the world. In March, a World Bank arbitration panel determined that Venezuela did not have to pay $1.4 billion to Exxon Mobil Corp. for confiscating company assets during a wave of nationalizations. Auto production in Venezuela has nearly ground to a halt amid the country's economic collapse. The cash-strapped government has choked off car companies' access to dollars needed to import parts and repatriate profits. GM's factory in the industrial city of Valencia has not produced a single car since 2015. Nationwide, car makers assembled just 2,849 cars last year, from a peak of 172,218 vehicles in 2007. Despite Venezuela's grim outlook, many car makers have decided to stay put and avoid the drastic step of shutting down operations to avoid losing market share in case the economy dramatically improves or a more business-friendly government takes power. GM has about 2,700 workers in Venezuela, where it's been the market leader for over 35 years. It also has 79 dealers that employ 3,900 people, and its parts suppliers make up more than half of Venezuela's auto parts market, the company said. The factory seizure arose from an almost 20-year-old lawsuit brought by a former GM dealership in western Venezuela. The dealership had been seeking damages from GM of 476 million bolivars -- about $665 million at the official exchange rate, but just $115 million on the black market where many Venezuelans are forced to turn to sell their increasingly worthless currency. GM said it was notified this week that a low-level court ordered an embargo of its plant, bank accounts and other assets in the country. Hundreds of workers desperate for information about their jobs gathered at the plant on Thursday to meet with government and military officials, as well as representatives of the dealership that brought the lawsuit. The Venezuelan government had no comment about the GM factory. In July of last year, the government took control of a factory belonging to Kimberly-Clark Corp. after the U.S. personal care giant said it was no longer possible to manufacture in the crisis-wracked nation due to a lack of materials. President Nicolas Maduro accused Kimberly-Clark of participating in an international plot to damage Venezuela's economy. Kimberly-Clark joined Bridgestone, General Mills, Procter & Gamble, Ford Motor Co. and other multinational corporations in scaling back operations in Venezuela. Ford suspended operations at its Valencia plant in December due to slumping sales. Toyota said its lone factory in Cumana, Venezuela, continues to operate normally. If the government permits it, GM workers at the Valencia plant will get separation benefits "arising from the termination of employment relationships due to causes beyond the parties' control," the GM statement said. Dealers will continue to service vehicles and provide parts, the company said. GM's Venezuelan operations have been a drag on earnings for several years. In the second quarter of 2015, the company took a $720 million charge for currency devaluation and asset valuation write-downs as the economy faltered. South American operations, which include Venezuela, account for a relatively small portion of GM's earnings and sales. Last year the company lost $400 million before taxes in South America, but as a whole the company made a pretax profit of $12.5 billion. GM sold just over 583,000 vehicles in the region last year, about 6 percent of its total sales. The company recently said that its South America region "remains challenged from macro-economic and political standpoints." Shares of General Motors Co. rose 59 cents to $34.38 in afternoon trading.

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya, File) f.duckett GM said Thursday that its only factory in Venezuela was confiscated. DETROIT (AP) — General Motors became the latest corporation to have a factory or other asset seized by the government of Venezuela, and the Detroit automaker faces an uphill battle to recover any damages. GM said Thursday that its only factory in Venezuela was confiscated a day earlier, as anti-government protesters clashed with authorities in a country that is roiled by economic troubles. GM said assets such as vehicles were taken from the plant, causing the company irreparable damage. The seizure is the latest in a long string of government confiscations of factories and other assets that have been a staple of the so-called 21st century socialist revolution in Venezuela started by the late Hugo Chavez two decades ago. Venezuela is currently fighting claims of illegal asset seizures at a World Bank-sponsored arbitration panel from more than 25 companies. GM vowed to defend itself legally but getting compensated could be difficult. Under Chavez, Venezuela seized some Exxon Mobil assets. The oil giant sought compensation of $16.6 billion. The company won a $1.4 billion judgment, but earlier this year the arbitration panel determined that Venezuela had to pay only $180 million. GM can seek compensation and damages for its lost plant in several different international venues, said Nigel Blackaby, a lawyer at the Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer law firm, which has battled Venezuela in several high-profile cases in international courts. The venue depends on what treaties, if any, govern the investment, he said. While Exxon's case was heard by the World Bank panel, Freshfields has successfully pursued claims against Venezuela's government before a United Nations panel. The Venezuelan government had no comment about the GM factory. Auto production in Venezuela has nearly ground to a halt amid the country's economic collapse. The cash-strapped government has choked off car companies' access to dollars needed to import parts and repatriate profits. GM's factory in the industrial city of Valencia did not produce a single vehicle last year. Nationwide, car makers assembled just 2,849 cars in 2016, from a peak of 172,218 in 2007. Still, many car makers have stayed put in case the economy experiences a turnaround. GM has about 2,700 workers in Venezuela, where it's been the market leader for over 35 years. It also has 79 dealers that employ 3,900 people. The factory seizure arose from an almost 20-year-old lawsuit brought by a former GM dealership in western Venezuela. The dealership had been seeking damages from GM of 476 million bolivars — about $665 million at the official exchange rate, but just $115 million on the black market where many Venezuelans are forced to turn to sell their increasingly worthless currency. GM said it was notified this week that a low-level court ordered an embargo of its plant, bank accounts and other assets in the country. Hundreds of workers desperate for information about their jobs gathered at the plant on Thursday to meet with government and military officials, as well as representatives of the dealership that brought the lawsuit. In Washington, the State Department said in a statement that it was reviewing details of the factory seizure and called on Venezuelan authorities to resolve the case "rapidly and transparently." The statement said a fair judicial system is critical to economic reforms that would restore growth, but it made no mention of any action the U.S. government might take. In July of last year, the Venezuelan government took control of a factory belonging to Kimberly-Clark Corp. after the U.S. personal care giant said it was no longer possible to manufacture in the crisis-wracked nation due to a lack of materials. President Nicolas Maduro accused Kimberly-Clark of participating in an international plot to damage Venezuela's economy. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

(Trevor Terfloth/The Daily News file photo) Tweet Change text size for the story Print Report an error The Thames River is going to get a good cleanup on Saturday, which is Earth Day in 192 countries around the world, with a focus on rigid plastics. Volunteers will be at a section of the Thames River near the Tecumseh Monument, east of Thamesville, as well as at Lighthouse Cove at the mouth of the river. However, the co-ordinator of the cleanup in the Chatham area plans to wait until later in May to organize an event. “We want the water level (in the river) to come down,” said Tamara Burton. She said with the unpredictability of the weather this time of the year along with the wet, slippery river banks from the recent rain can be a safety issue. Burton said there will be a lot more plastic and other garbage found when the river level lowers. Kevin Howard will be leading a cleanup effort that will be begin at the Tecumseh Monument at 9 a.m. on Saturday. “I've been hosting this event here since 2011 and the area has definitely improved since then,” he said. “The last couple of years has seen a dramatic decrease in the amount of garbage that we've had to pick up, which is great,” he added. Howard said garbage bags and gloves will be available for participants, who he advises should dress for weather conditions. He added parents will need to supervise children since they will be near the river. Howard said this is also a good opportunity for high school students to earn volunteer hours for their diploma, adding if they bring their volunteer forms, they will be signed. There will also be a chance to learn about geocaching, he said, since it is the Southwestern Ontario Geocachers hosting this section of the cleanup. Gerry and Kris Hooft and their children are organizing the Lighthouse Cove cleanup. Gerry Hooft said those wanting to participate should be at the Lighthouse Lions Club by 9:30 a.m. to have a coffee and get supplies. He noted the cleanup will include everything north of the rail line. He also noted students are welcome to get hours for their high school community service requirement. Todd Sleeper has organized the annual Thames River Cleanup for the past 18 years, which covers about 200 kilometres in 17 communities including Mitchell, Woodstock and London. “We're promoting the adopt a river program for people to take care of a certain section of the river,” said the London resident. “If people were even to adopt their own property and others did public lands, I don't see why we couldn't cover the entire river,” he added. Sleeper said TerraCycle has come on board this year to make sure hard plastics are recycled. According to TerraCycle much of the plastic collected during the river cleanup isn't accepted by municipal blue box programs or has deteriorated in the sun, sand and algae to the point it must be landfilled. TerraCycle has sent Sleeper 50 pre-paid packing slips for recovered plastics, and he’s passing them on to different groups of volunteers along the river. Each slip will cover almost 70 kilograms of plastic. “They’re expecting a lot from us,” Sleeper said. Last year’s cleanup signed up about 1,500 people to remove garbage along the river. TerraCycle, which recently launched a worldwide beach cleanup campaign, sends plastic to Procter & Gamble Co. for reuse in packaging. P&G announced in January its Head & Shoulders shampoo bottles would be made with up to 25 per cent recycled beach plastic. “Anything that is rigid plastic is material we want and we can use,” said Brett Stevens, TerraCycle‘s vice-president of material sales and procurement. “As long as it is rigid plastic, we recycle 100 per cent of it.” The company is reaching out to groups already doing beach and river cleanups, and got in touch with Sleeper, Stevens said.

Photo Credit: AP advertisement | advertise on newsday DETROIT - General Motors became the latest corporation to have a factory or other asset seized by the government of Venezuela, and the Detroit automaker faces an uphill battle to recover any damages. GM said Thursday that its only factory in Venezuela was confiscated a day earlier, as anti-government protesters clashed with authorities in a country that is roiled by economic troubles.

Venezuela is currently fighting claims of illegal asset seizures at a World Bank-sponsored arbitration panel from more than 25 companies, making it one of the most-frequently targeted nations in the world. In March, a World Bank arbitration panel determined that Venezuela did not have to pay $1.4 billion to Exxon Mobil Corp. for confiscating company assets during a wave of nationalizations. Auto production in Venezuela has nearly ground to a halt amid the country's economic collapse. The cash-strapped government has choked off car companies' access to dollars needed to import parts and repatriate profits. GM's factory in the industrial city of Valencia has not produced a single car since 2015. Nationwide, car makers assembled just 2,849 cars last year, from a peak of 172,218 vehicles in 2007. CarsSee 2018 car models on display at the New York Auto Show Despite Venezuela's grim outlook, many car makers have decided to stay put and avoid the drastic step of shutting down operations to avoid losing market share in case the economy dramatically improves or a more business-friendly government takes power. advertisement | advertise on newsday GM has about 2,700 workers in Venezuela, where it's been the market leader for over 35 years. It also has 79 dealers that employ 3,900 people, and its parts suppliers make up more than half of Venezuela's auto parts market, the company said. The factory seizure arose from an almost 20-year-old lawsuit brought by a former GM dealership in western Venezuela. The dealership had been seeking damages from GM of 476 million bolivars — about $665 million at the official exchange rate, but just $115 million on the black market where many Venezuelans are forced to turn to sell their increasingly worthless currency. GM said it was notified this week that a low-level court ordered an embargo of its plant, bank accounts and other assets in the country. Hundreds of workers desperate for information about their jobs gathered at the plant on Thursday to meet with government and military officials, as well as representatives of the dealership that brought the lawsuit. The Venezuelan government had no comment about the GM factory. CarsWhat to look for at the 2017 NY auto show In July of last year, the government took control of a factory belonging to Kimberly-Clark Corp. after the U.S. personal care giant said it was no longer possible to manufacture in the crisis-wracked nation due to a lack of materials. President Nicolas Maduro accused Kimberly-Clark of participating in an international plot to damage Venezuela's economy. Tweets from https://twitter.com/NewsdayBiz/lists/newsday-biz-staff Kimberly-Clark joined Bridgestone, General Mills, Procter & Gamble, Ford Motor Co. and other multinational corporations in scaling back operations in Venezuela. Ford suspended operations at its Valencia plant in December due to slumping sales. Toyota said its lone factory in Cumana, Venezuela, continues to operate normally. If the government permits it, GM workers at the Valencia plant will get separation benefits "arising from the termination of employment relationships due to causes beyond the parties' control," the GM statement said. Dealers will continue to service vehicles and provide parts, the company said. GM's Venezuelan operations have been a drag on earnings for several years. In the second quarter of 2015, the company took a $720 million charge for currency devaluation and asset valuation write-downs as the economy faltered. South American operations, which include Venezuela, account for a relatively small portion of GM's earnings and sales. Last year the company lost $400 million before taxes in South America, but as a whole the company made a pretax profit of $12.5 billion.

GM said Thursday that its only factory in Venezuela was confiscated a day earlier, as anti-government protesters clashed with authorities in a country that is roiled by economic troubles. GM said assets such as vehicles were taken from the plant, causing the company irreparable damage. The seizure is the latest in a long string of government confiscations of factories and other assets that have been a staple of the so-called 21st century socialist revolution in Venezuela started by the late Hugo Chavez two decades ago. Venezuela is currently fighting claims of illegal asset seizures at a World Bank-sponsored arbitration panel from more than 25 companies. GM vowed to defend itself legally but getting compensated could be difficult. Under Chavez, Venezuela seized some Exxon Mobil assets. The oil giant sought compensation of $16.6 billion. The company won a $1.4 billion judgment, but earlier this year the arbitration panel determined that Venezuela had to pay only $180 million. GM can seek compensation and damages for its lost plant in several different international venues, said Nigel Blackaby, a lawyer at the Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer law firm, which has battled Venezuela in several high-profile cases in international courts. The venue depends on what treaties, if any, govern the investment, he said. While Exxon's case was heard by the World Bank panel, Freshfields has successfully pursued claims against Venezuela's government before a United Nations panel. The Venezuelan government had no comment about the GM factory. Auto production in Venezuela has nearly ground to a halt amid the country's economic collapse. The cash-strapped government has choked off car companies' access to dollars needed to import parts and repatriate profits. GM's factory in the industrial city of Valencia did not produce a single vehicle last year. Nationwide, car makers assembled just 2,849 cars in 2016, from a peak of 172,218 in 2007. Still, many car makers have stayed put in case the economy experiences a turnaround. GM has about 2,700 workers in Venezuela, where it's been the market leader for over 35 years. It also has 79 dealers that employ 3,900 people. The factory seizure arose from an almost 20-year-old lawsuit brought by a former GM dealership in western Venezuela. The dealership had been seeking damages from GM of 476 million bolivars - about $665 million at the official exchange rate, but just $115 million on the black market where many Venezuelans are forced to turn to sell their increasingly worthless currency. GM said it was notified this week that a low-level court ordered an embargo of its plant, bank accounts and other assets in the country. Hundreds of workers desperate for information about their jobs gathered at the plant on Thursday to meet with government and military officials, as well as representatives of the dealership that brought the lawsuit. In Washington, the State Department said in a statement that it was reviewing details of the factory seizure and called on Venezuelan authorities to resolve the case "rapidly and transparently." The statement said a fair judicial system is critical to economic reforms that would restore growth, but it made no mention of any action the U.S. government might take. In July of last year, the Venezuelan government took control of a factory belonging to Kimberly-Clark Corp. after the U.S. personal care giant said it was no longer possible to manufacture in the crisis-wracked nation due to a lack of materials. President Nicolas Maduro accused Kimberly-Clark of participating in an international plot to damage Venezuela's economy. In recent years, Bridgestone, General Mills, Procter & Gamble, Ford Motor Co. and other multinational corporations have also scaled back operations in Venezuela. Ford suspended operations at its Valencia plant in December due to slumping sales. Toyota said its lone factory in Cumana, Venezuela, continues to operate normally. GM's Venezuelan operations have been a drag on earnings for several years. In the second quarter of 2015, the company took a $720 million charge for currency devaluation and asset valuation write-downs as the economy faltered. South American operations, which include Venezuela, account for about 6 percent GM's total sales. Last year, GM lost $400 million before taxes in South America, but overall it made a pretax profit of $12.5 billion. Shares of General Motors Co. rose 31 cents to close at $34.10. ___ Goodman reported from Caracas. Dee-Ann Durbin in Detroit and Christopher Rugaber in Washington contributed to this report.

Despite Venezuela's grim outlook, many car makers have decided to stay put and avoid the drastic step of shutting down operations to avoid losing market share in case the economy dramatically improves or a more business-friendly government takes power. GM has about 2,700 workers in Venezuela, where it's been the market leader for over 35 years. It also has 79 dealers that employ 3,900 people, and its parts suppliers make up more than half of Venezuela's auto parts market, the company said.

Ford suspended operations at its Valencia plant in December due to slumping sales. Toyota said its lone factory in Cumana, Venezuela, continues to operate normally. If the government permits it, GM workers at the Valencia plant will get separation benefits "arising from the termination of employment relationships due to causes beyond the parties' control," the GM statement said. Dealers will continue to service vehicles and provide parts, the company said. GM's Venezuelan operations have been a drag on earnings for several years. In the second quarter of 2015, the company took a $720 million charge for currency devaluation and asset valuation write-downs as the economy faltered.

IAB to Make TAG Registration Mandatory for Members to Fight Fraud and Improve Brand Safety Trade Group Follows P&G in Requiring Trust & Transparency “No one should be exempt from our industry’s health code,” says IAB President & CEO Randall Rothenberg April 20, 2017 02:29 PM Eastern Daylight Time NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) today announced that all its member publishers and technology companies will be required to register with the Trustworthy Accountability Group (TAG), the digital ad industry’s program to fight fraud and other criminal activity, to remain eligible for continued membership in the industry’s leading trade association. The IAB is giving its 463 General Member companies until June 1, 2018 to obtain TAG Registration, a process verifying them as legitimate participants in the digital advertising industry. TAG is the initiative launched in 2015 by the IAB and its partners, the American Association of Advertising Agencies (4A’s) and Association for National Advertisers (ANA) to fight fraud, malware, piracy, and lack of transparency. As added incentives, IAB said it has negotiated free TAG Registration for its smaller members and discounts of 12.5 to 25 percent off TAG’s rate card for its larger members. “The digital ad industry’s open supply chain is the source of our innovation and the source of our risks,” said IAB President and CEO Randall Rothenberg, in announcing the change to the trade body’s membership criteria. “Making TAG Registration a requirement for IAB members will make our supply chain safer, while still allowing innovative media and advertising solutions to flourish.” Rothenberg called on other industry trade bodies to make TAG Registration mandatory for their members, saying it would create a “web of trust” among brands, ad agencies, publishers, and all other companies that touch digital advertising inventory, and help them identify companies that have committed to best practices in supply chain management. “TAG administers our industry’s health code,” Rothenberg said. “No one should be exempt from our industry’s health code.” Founded just over two years ago, TAG recently announced that more than 200 companies from 20 countries have applied for TAG Registration, including many of the world’s most prominent publishers, brands, agencies, and technology intermediaries. TAG Registration is the prerequisite for participation in TAG’s four seal programs, which allow companies to validate their compliance with industry best practices in preventing fraud, malware, and piracy, as well as improving the transparency of their inventory. Several leading advertisers, including Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, and Charter Communications, have announced that they will soon start requiring the publishers with which they advertise to join TAG’s “Certified Against Fraud” program, the rigorous set of anti-fraud requirements validated by TAG. Rothenberg urged other marketers and agencies to make their own public commitments to work only with companies that effectively fight fraud, ad-supported piracy, and the distribution of malware. “Today’s action by the IAB is a momentous event in our industry’s fight against fraud,” said Mike Zaneis, CEO of TAG. “With hundreds of companies interlocking their efforts, we will cut off the flow of money to criminals and shine a bright light of transparency into the digital ad supply chain. Today does not mark the end of digital ad fraud, but the path to that goal is clear. Under revisions to its Member Code of Conduct approved by the IAB Board of Directors Executive Committee, current IAB General Members will have until June 1, 2018 to register with TAG. All new IAB General Members will have to register as a condition for being accepted into IAB membership. Companies can obtain additional information and apply for TAG Registration at https://tagtoday.net/registration.

Through the work of its public policy office in Washington, D.C., the IAB advocates for its members and promotes the value of the interactive advertising industry to legislators and policymakers.

As added incentives, IAB said it has negotiated free TAG Registration for its smaller members and discounts of 12.5 to 25 percent off TAG’s rate card for its larger members. “The digital ad industry’s open supply chain is the source of our innovation and the source of our risks,” said IAB President and CEO Randall Rothenberg, in announcing the change to the trade body’s membership criteria. “Making TAG Registration a requirement for IAB members will make our supply chain safer, while still allowing innovative media and advertising solutions to flourish.” Rothenberg called on other industry trade bodies to make TAG Registration mandatory for their members, saying it would create a “web of trust” among brands, ad agencies, publishers, and all other companies that touch digital advertising inventory, and help them identify companies that have committed to best practices in supply chain management. “TAG administers our industry’s health code,” Rothenberg said. “No one should be exempt from our industry’s health code.” Founded just over two years ago, TAG recently announced that more than 200 companies from 20 countries have applied for TAG Registration, including many of the world’s most prominent publishers, brands, agencies, and technology intermediaries. TAG Registration is the prerequisite for participation in TAG’s four seal programs, which allow companies to validate their compliance with industry best practices in preventing fraud, malware, and piracy, as well as improving the transparency of their inventory. Several leading advertisers, including Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, and Charter Communications, have announced that they will soon start requiring the publishers with which they advertise to join TAG’s “Certified Against Fraud” program, the rigorous set of anti-fraud requirements validated by TAG. Rothenberg urged other marketers and agencies to make their own public commitments to work only with companies that effectively fight fraud, ad-supported piracy, and the distribution of malware. “Today’s action by the IAB is a momentous event in our industry’s fight against fraud,” said Mike Zaneis, CEO of TAG. “With hundreds of companies interlocking their efforts, we will cut off the flow of money to criminals and shine a bright light of transparency into the digital ad supply chain. Today does not mark the end of digital ad fraud, but the path to that goal is clear. Under revisions to its Member Code of Conduct approved by the IAB Board of Directors Executive Committee, current IAB General Members will have until June 1, 2018 to register with TAG. All new IAB General Members will have to register as a condition for being accepted into IAB membership. Companies can obtain additional information and apply for TAG Registration at https://tagtoday.net/registration.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search Three High-Yield REIT Picks For Retirees April 20, 2017 9:03am NYSE:VNQ ShareTweet From Contrarian Outlook: Real estate investment trusts (REITs), when picked carefully, provide generous dividends that will fund your retirement cash flow needs by themselves. Today I’m going to show you how REITs are literally the best buy-and-hold asset you can put your money into – and I’ll introduce you to three powerful real estate plays yielding up to 7.8% annually. These three are well positioned for decades of outperformance against the rest of the investment world. We all know that REITs are income machines. First-quarter 2017 data shows that REITs on average yielded 4.1% — more than double the average S&P 500 stock! But many self-annointed “REIT gurus” focus too much on income and ignore REITs’ other outstanding virtue: growth potential. You see, REITs are becoming an increasingly large cog in America’s (and the world’s) real estate machine. The days of small mom-and-pop building owners are numbered – REITs are increasingly gobbling up apartments, malls, medical centers, golf courses, datacenters and self-storage! Thus, REITs aren’t just delivering big, fat dividend checks – they’re delivering capital gains, too, The result has been a total return performance that has outstripped every other holding in retirement-focused portfolios. Pension fund analysis and benchmarking servicer CEM Benchmarking delivered a study examining the returns of REITs and 11 other asset classes for more than 200 pension funds. This chart tells you everything you need to know: Source: CRM Benchmarking Bonds, large-cap stocks and even private equity shops were unable to outdo publicly traded REITs, which delivered average net returns of 12% annually to pension funds. Which REITs are ready to return 12%+ in the years ahead? Here are three to consider with 6.3% to 7.8% current yields and 15% to 20% price upside to boot: LaSalle Hotel Properties (LHO) Dividend Yield: 6.3% Did you know that in 2016, the U.S. added 400,000 millionaires, lifting America’s seven-digit class to 10.8 million strong – so while the middle class might be evaporating, the upper class is expanding, and fast. That means plenty of potential for companies positioned in luxury – good news for hotelier LaSalle Hotel Properties (LHO). LaSalle owns 42 upscale hotels and resorts across seven states and Washington, D.C., though it’s a little different in that rather than simply acquiring existing luxury properties, it also redevelops and repurposes some. The portfolio includes hotels such as the Grafton on Sunset in Los Angeles, Chaminade Resort & Spa in Santa Cruz and the Kimpton Onyx in Boston. What’s particularly attractive about LaSalle is how well-covered the dividend is. LHO yields more than 6% on quarterly dividends of roughly 45 cents per share, and it doled out $1.80 per share in 2016 … against adjusted funds from operation of $2.90 per share. That’s a mere 62% AFFO payout ratio, which means that dividend is about as safe as they come. LaSalle Hotel Properties (LHO) Is an Upper Crust REIT Preferred Apartment Communities (APTS) Dividend Yield: 6.4% Preferred Apartment Communities (APTS) is one of the biggest growth dynamos in the REIT space right now, dishing out 66% in capital gains alone over the past five years to nearly double the return of the Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ). What has Wall Street so giddy about this one? APTS primarily owns and operates multi-family properties in the U.S., though it also dips its fingers into a number of secondary investments, including student housing, office properties and even mortgage and other loans. What’s really interesting about APTS is that it’s able to aggressively purchase new properties while still maintaining a roughly 90% FFO payout ratio because it raises money via non-traded preferred shares. The company expects to raise $2 billion over the next three years via offerings of its mShares no-loaded preferred and commission-based Series A redeemable preferred shares. Preferred Apartment Communities also has raised its dividend six times over the past five years, for a total 47% improvement in the payout since its first quarterly distribution in 2013. Everything about APTS screams growth, from its portfolio to its stock price to its dividend. This is a clear buy with enormous potential. Preferred Apartment Communities (APTS) Is Powered by Preferreds Select Income REIT (SIR) Dividend Yield: 7.8% Last up is Select Income REIT (SIR), a hybrid of sorts that owns industrial properties and office properties, both of which are typically leased to single tenants such as FedEx (FDX) and ServiceNow (NOW). All told, the company’s 121 properties across 35 states represent approximately 44.8 million rentable square feet – with 40% of that space located in Hawaii. In fact, Select Income REIT is Hawaii’s largest industrial landowner. While it’s a relatively boring industry, the growth has been explosive, with revenues blasting off from $188 million in 2013 to $462 million last year. Management has raised the dividend by a little more than 20 percent over the past five years, but also maintained a comfortable FFO payout ratio in the 70% range. Moreover, SIR has also quieted a longtime concern – issuing a boatload of stock for years – by keeping its shares count level since late 2015. Select Income (SIR) Has Worked Out All the Kinks Live Off Dividends Forever With This “Ultimate” Retirement Portfolio Capital gains and big, sustainable yields are the cornerstones of the kind of retirement portfolio that will keep you living comfortably for decades after you retire. That’s because the key to a successful retirement isn’t just being able to live off dividends – it’s growing your nest egg at the same time, providing you with an essential backstop for whenever life throws you a curveball. The Vanguard REIT Index Fund (NYSE:VNQ) was unchanged in premarket trading Thursday. Year-to-date, VNQ has gained 3.48%, versus a 4.72% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. VNQ currently has an ETF Daily News SMART Grade of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #1 of 20 ETFs in the Real Estate ETFs category. But your retirement account needs to yield a bit more than what a couple of these plays offer. Specifically, you need to target the 8% yield of my “No Withdrawal” retirement portfolio! Why 8%? Think about the recommendations you typically see from stock-picking pundits. They tell you to put your faith in blue chips like Procter & Gamble or Coca-Cola – companies that typically yield 3%, maybe 4% if you’re lucky. But the math doesn’t work! If you earn 3% to 4% returns on a nest egg of half a million dollars, you’ll only generate $20,000 in annual income from dividends – at the high end! You didn’t work so hard in life to retire with so little to show for it. My “No Withdrawal” portfolio ensures that you won’t have to settle during the most important years of your life. I’ve put together an all-star portfolio that allows you to collect an 8% yield, while growing your nest egg – a critical aspect of retirement investing that most other strategies leave out. I’ve spent most of the past few months digging into the high-dividend world, and it’s harrowing to think about how many potential yield traps and retirement killers I’ve come across. However, the hard work has paid off, and I’ve been able to compile an “ultimate” dividend portfolio that provides you with … No-doubt dividends that yield more than 8% on average The potential for 7% to 15% in annual capital gains Robust dividend growth that will keep up with (and beat!) inflation These picks include the crème de la crème of several high-income assets, from preferred stocks to REITs to closed-end funds and more. That means crucial diversification that can weather any sort of economic storm. Don’t scrape by on meager blue-chip returns and Social Security checks, wondering whether your retirement income will be enough to pay the bills. You’ve worked too hard to settle when it matters most. Instead, collect big, dependable dividend checks that will let you see the world and live in comfort for the rest of your post-career life. Let me show you the path to the retirement you deserve. Click here and I’ll provide you with THREE special reports that show you how to build this “No Withdrawal” portfolio. You’ll get the names, tickers, buy prices and full analysis of their wealth-building potential – and it’s absolutely FREE! This article is brought to you courtesy of Contrarian Outlook.

General Motors says it has halted operations in Venezuela after authorities seized a factory. The plant was confiscated on Wednesday, April 19, 2017, in what GM called an illegal judicial seizure of its assets. GM says its due process rights were violated and it will take legal steps to fight the seizure. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya, File) f.duckett GM said Thursday that its only factory in Venezuela was confiscated. DETROIT (AP) — General Motors became the latest corporation to have a factory or other asset seized by the government of Venezuela, and the Detroit automaker faces an uphill battle to recover any damages. GM said Thursday that its only factory in Venezuela was confiscated a day earlier, as anti-government protesters clashed with authorities in a country that is roiled by economic troubles. GM said assets such as vehicles were taken from the plant, causing the company irreparable damage. The seizure is the latest in a long string of government confiscations of factories and other assets that have been a staple of the so-called 21st century socialist revolution in Venezuela started by the late Hugo Chavez two decades ago. Venezuela is currently fighting claims of illegal asset seizures at a World Bank-sponsored arbitration panel from more than 25 companies. GM vowed to defend itself legally but getting compensated could be difficult. Under Chavez, Venezuela seized some Exxon Mobil assets. The oil giant sought compensation of $16.6 billion. The company won a $1.4 billion judgment, but earlier this year the arbitration panel determined that Venezuela had to pay only $180 million. GM can seek compensation and damages for its lost plant in several different international venues, said Nigel Blackaby, a lawyer at the Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer law firm, which has battled Venezuela in several high-profile cases in international courts. The venue depends on what treaties, if any, govern the investment, he said. While Exxon's case was heard by the World Bank panel, Freshfields has successfully pursued claims against Venezuela's government before a United Nations panel. The Venezuelan government had no comment about the GM factory. Auto production in Venezuela has nearly ground to a halt amid the country's economic collapse. The cash-strapped government has choked off car companies' access to dollars needed to import parts and repatriate profits. GM's factory in the industrial city of Valencia did not produce a single vehicle last year. Nationwide, car makers assembled just 2,849 cars in 2016, from a peak of 172,218 in 2007. Still, many car makers have stayed put in case the economy experiences a turnaround. GM has about 2,700 workers in Venezuela, where it's been the market leader for over 35 years. It also has 79 dealers that employ 3,900 people. The factory seizure arose from an almost 20-year-old lawsuit brought by a former GM dealership in western Venezuela. The dealership had been seeking damages from GM of 476 million bolivars — about $665 million at the official exchange rate, but just $115 million on the black market where many Venezuelans are forced to turn to sell their increasingly worthless currency. GM said it was notified this week that a low-level court ordered an embargo of its plant, bank accounts and other assets in the country. Hundreds of workers desperate for information about their jobs gathered at the plant on Thursday to meet with government and military officials, as well as representatives of the dealership that brought the lawsuit. In Washington, the State Department said in a statement that it was reviewing details of the factory seizure and called on Venezuelan authorities to resolve the case "rapidly and transparently." The statement said a fair judicial system is critical to economic reforms that would restore growth, but it made no mention of any action the U.S. government might take. In July of last year, the Venezuelan government took control of a factory belonging to Kimberly-Clark Corp. after the U.S. personal care giant said it was no longer possible to manufacture in the crisis-wracked nation due to a lack of materials. President Nicolas Maduro accused Kimberly-Clark of participating in an international plot to damage Venezuela's economy.

Ford suspended operations at its Valencia plant in December due to slumping sales. Toyota said its lone factory in Cumana, Venezuela, continues to operate normally. GM's Venezuelan operations have been a drag on earnings for several years. In the second quarter of 2015, the company took a $720 million charge for currency devaluation and asset valuation write-downs as the economy faltered. South American operations, which include Venezuela, account for about 6 percent GM's total sales. Last year, GM lost $400 million before taxes in South America, but overall it made a pretax profit of $12.5 billion. Shares of General Motors Co. rose 31 cents to close at $34.10. ___ Goodman reported from Caracas. Dee-Ann Durbin in Detroit and Christopher Rugaber in Washington contributed to this report.

Wednesday’s move follows decisions over the past few years to concentrate on boosting profits in such markets as North America and China. GM earlier this year opted to sell its chronically money-losing Opel and Vauxhall brands and surrender its annual 1 million-plus European sales to French automaker PSA Group. The Detroit carmaker also has opted to leave Russia, cease manufacturing in Indonesia and Australia, and restructure in Thailand. Just before GM CEO Mary Barra took charge in early 2014, the automaker said it would largely pull the Chevrolet brand from Europe, leaving only a few performance models like the Chevrolet Corvette. GM builds a small number of vehicles in Venezuela, and its sales there are miniscule compared to the 10 million vehicles it sold worldwide last year. Pressured by a lagging share price and investor skepticism, GM’s leadership in recent years has focused on returning value to shareholders and growing in profitable markets instead of maintaining a presence in all of them. The Valencia plant in Venezuela was confiscated Wednesday as anti-government protesters clashed with authorities in a country roiling in economic troubles such as food shortages and triple-digit inflation. The country is highly dependent on oil; as oil prices have fallen in recent years, so has its economy. GM had not built a vehicle in the Valencia factory since 2015, according to some media reports. For more than 40 days, the Valencia plant had been shut down by an aggressive takeover by members of a union, a GM representative told the New York Times. GM asked the Venezuelan government for help, but instead the government took over its facility. Miguel R. Tinker Salas, a professor of Latin American history at Pomona College in California, believes the government likely seized the plant because of labor disputes and because GM stopped building cars there. Production from GM and other automakers is so small, he added, that the industry is not an active part of the Venezuelan economy. Auto production has come to a near halt as the cash-strapped government has choked off car companies’ access to dollars needed to import parts and repatriate profits. Last year, not even 3,000 vehicles were produced in Venezuela, down from some 170,000 in 2007, according to the Associated Press. The Detroit automaker said in a statement Thursday that assets such as vehicles were illegally taken from the plant: “The seizure was granted and enforced in total disregard of (General Motors Venezuela’s) right to due process, causing irreparable damage to the company.” GM says it will defend itself legally inside and outside of Venezuela. A GM spokeswoman Thursday declined to provide specifics on how many and what vehicles it sells in the country. But financial market research firm Evercore ISI wrote in a note to investors Thursday that GM was only expected to produce about 735 vehicles in Venezuela in 2017, “hence any lost production is unlikely to prove material.” GM, which began operations in Venezuela in 1948, has about 2,700 workers in the country, where it’s been the market leader for more than 35 years. It has 79 dealers that employ 3,900 people, and its parts suppliers make up more than half of Venezuela’s auto parts market, the company said. Dealers will continue to service vehicles and provide parts. GM’s Venezuelan operations have hurt overall profits in recent years. In the second quarter of 2015, the company took a $720 million charge for currency devaluation and asset valuation write-downs and in 2014, it took a charge of $419 million related to Venezuela. In 2015, GM cut 13 percent of its workforce in the country and for half of 2014 had essentially no production there. South American operations, which include Venezuela, account for a relatively small portion of GM’s earnings and sales. Last year the company lost $400 million before taxes in South America, but as a whole the company made a pretax profit of $12.5 billion. GM sold just over 583,000 vehicles in the region last year, but that was only about 6 percent of its total sales. Companies have been cutting operations in Venezuela as a result of runaway inflation and strict currency controls. Last May, tire-maker Bridgestone sold its business there after six decades of operating in the country. Ford Motor Co. in early 2015 said it would take a one-time $800 million pretax charge for Venezuela after regulations in the country stopped the automaker from exchanging U.S. dollars for bolivars. Ford has an assembly plant in Valencia employing about 2,500, but it has not produced vehicles since December as it balances production with demand, a Ford spokeswoman said. It opened in 1962 and produces the Ford Explorer and Fiesta. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and Toyota Motor Corp. also have factories in Venezuela. Toyota has about 1,200 employees at a plant in Cumaná that builds vehicles including the Corolla. A Toyota spokesman said the company’s operations have not been affected, though it is “monitoring the situation closely.” Fiat Chrysler has an assembly plant in Valencia that employs about 880; they build the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Forza. The company said Thursday it is maintaining its production plans there. GM’s stock closed up Thursday nearly 1 percent to close at $34.11 a share. mburden@detroitnews.com Detroit News Staff Writers Ian Thibodeau and Jim Lynch and the Associated Press contributed. 956 CONNECTTWEET 19 LINKEDIN 98 COMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Cosmetics have come from late civilizations due to need for improving looks and appearance. Since then, ingredients in cosmetics have changed drastically and new techniques and formulas were introduced to manufacture own cosmetics and scents. Different minerals were used to produce colors by the ancient Egyptian aristocracy to give description to their facial features. During the Greek era it was very universal to make use of face paints, while the Romans favored baths that contained oil based perfumes. Almost 1500 chemical entities have been recognized to be cosmetic chemicals globally. The common chemicals that are found in the cosmetics include thickening agents, carrier powders, colorants, pigments, surfactants, preservatives, emollients, film formers and moisturizers among others. The cosmetics chemicals which are consumed on a large scale include emollients, film formers and moisturizers followed by surfactants globally.

GM says it has halted operations in Venezuela after authorities seized its factory. Picture: Juan Carlos Hernandez/AP AP Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend GENERAL Motors became the latest corporation to have a factory or other asset seized by the socialist government of Venezuela, and the Detroit automaker faces an uphill battle to recover any damages. GM said Thursday that its only factory in Venezuela was confiscated a day earlier, as anti-government protesters clashed with authorities in a country that is roiled by economic troubles. GM said assets such as vehicles were taken from the plant, causing the company irreparable damage. The seizure is the latest in a long string of government confiscations of factories and other assets that have been a staple of the so-called 21st century socialist revolution in Venezuela started by the late Hugo Chavez two decades ago. Venezuela is currently fighting claims of illegal asset seizures at a World Bank-sponsored arbitration panel from more than 25 companies. GM vowed to defend itself legally but getting compensated could be difficult. Under Chavez, Venezuela seized some Exxon Mobil assets. The oil giant sought compensation of $US16.6 billion ($22.07 billion). The company won a $US1.4 billion ($1.86 billion) judgment, but earlier this year the arbitration panel determined that Venezuela had to pay only $US180 million ($239 million). GM can seek compensation and damages for its lost plant in several different international venues, said Nigel Blackaby, a lawyer at the Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer law firm, which has battled Venezuela in several high-profile cases in international courts. The venue depends on what treaties, if any, govern the investment, he said. While Exxon’s case was heard by the World Bank panel, Freshfields has successfully pursued claims against Venezuela’s government before a United Nations panel. The Venezuelan government had no comment about the GM factory. Auto production in Venezuela has nearly ground to a halt amid the country’s economic collapse. The cash-strapped government has choked off car companies’ access to dollars needed to import parts and repatriate profits. The factory did not produce a single car last year. Picture: Marcos Guedez/AFPSource:AFP GM’s factory in the industrial city of Valencia did not produce a single vehicle last year. Nationwide, car makers assembled just 2849 cars in 2016, from a peak of 172,218 in 2007. Still, many car makers have stayed put in case the economy experiences a turnaround. GM has about 2700 workers in Venezuela, where it’s been the market leader for over 35 years. It also has 79 dealers that employ 3900 people. The factory seizure arose from an almost 20-year-old lawsuit brought by a former GM dealership in western Venezuela. The dealership had been seeking damages from GM of 476 million bolivars — about $US665 million ($884 million) at the official exchange rate, but just $US115 million ($153 million) on the black market where many Venezuelans are forced to turn to sell their increasingly worthless currency. GM said it was notified this week that a low-level court ordered an embargo of its plant, bank accounts and other assets in the country. Hundreds of workers desperate for information about their jobs gathered at the plant on Thursday to meet with government and military officials, as well as representatives of the dealership that brought the lawsuit. In Washington, the State Department said in a statement that it was reviewing details of the factory seizure and called on Venezuelan authorities to resolve the case “rapidly and transparently.” The statement said a fair judicial system is critical to economic reforms that would restore growth, but it made no mention of any action the US government might take. In July of last year, the Venezuelan government took control of a factory belonging to Kimberly-Clark Corp. after the US personal care giant said it was no longer possible to manufacture in the crisis-wracked nation due to a lack of materials. President Nicolas Maduro accused Kimberly-Clark of participating in an international plot to damage Venezuela’s economy. In recent years, Bridgestone, General Mills, Procter & Gamble, Ford Motor Co. and other multinational corporations have also scaled back operations in Venezuela. Ford suspended operations at its Valencia plant in December due to slumping sales. Toyota said its lone factory in Cumana, Venezuela, continues to operate normally. GM’s Venezuelan operations have been a drag on earnings for several years. In the second quarter of 2015, the company took a $US720 million ($957 million) charge for currency devaluation and asset valuation writedowns as the economy faltered. South American operations, which include Venezuela, account for about six per cent GM’s total sales. Last year, GM lost $US400 million ($532 million) before taxes in South America, but overall it made a pretax profit of $US12.5 billion ($16.62 billion). Shares of General Motors Co. rose 31 cents to close at $US34.10.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 20 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman The 2.4 Billion Dollar Easter Bunny: A Guide to Merchandising Candy at Walmart by Quri SAN FRANCISCO, April 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Quri, the leader in Performance Driven Merchandising™, is announcing today the release of Merchandising Matters, a series of guides highlighting merchandising execution data sourced from Quri’s millions of store visits. Quri is releasing its first guide, showcasing Easter candy in-store merchandising performance, by analyzing one of America’s most successful and recognizable retailers – Walmart. The goal of the guide is to help educate the entire CPG ecosystem on the value of Performance Driven Merchandising™ and its ability to improve in-store merchandising ROI. „According to the National Retail Federation, Americans will have spent approximately 2.4 billion dollars on candy during Easter with roughly 25% of those sales occurring in Walmart,” comments David Gottlieb, President and COO of Quri. „Our new Merchandising Matters guides will provide brands with mission critical merchandising benchmarks for major retailers, helping them calibrate their own tactics and plan more effective programs with their most important customers.” Quri’s Merchandising Matters guides include key metrics like display compliance, display presence, on-shelf availability, display location, and type details. To create the new guide, Quri analyzed ten confectionery brands in 700 Walmart stores for the 14-day Easter power period ending Sunday, April 16th. The brands mentioned are: Butterfinger, Cadbury, Dove Chocolate, Ghirardelli, Hershey’s, Jelly Belly, Lindt, M&M’S, Peeps, Reese’s and observations from the guide suggest: On-Shelf Availability (OSA): Measuring on-shelf availability based on a quantified shopper view of the store is vital to keeping fast-moving seasonal items like candy, fully stocked in the weeks leading up to Easter. At Walmart, average on-shelf availability ranges from 88% to 99% with an average of 96.5% across all categories. Candy fell just below that average at 95% during Easter, but some key seasonal items such as Peeps and Jelly Belly showed OSA levels of only 86% and 87% respectively. Closing on-shelf gaps is vital to protecting brand share and increasing sales, especially during peak periods such as Easter. Display Execution: When it comes to executing display promotions, Quri’s advice is to consistently measure display compliance and understand how a brand compares to both its competition and retailer averages in order to protect and grow sales and share. At Walmart, display execution for 10 major candy brands during Easter averaged 42% with a high of 81% for Reese’s and a low of 4% for Jelly Belly. Increasing display execution during seasonal peaks like Easter is a significant opportunity for brands to capture incremental sales in this mass channel. Display Location: Displays are executed in Walmart’s coveted Action Alley 38% of the time, compared to 10% in the back of the store. Understanding where a retailer displays a brand and which locations are most effective at driving sales lift will help merchandisers maximize the ROI of their displays. Display Type: As not all display types are created equal, understanding which are most frequently executed at a retailer is key.

See Offers News Posted Yesterday at 9:20 AM Updated April 20 increase font size GM halts operations in Venezuela after government seizes factory The automaker says that vehicles and other assets were taken from the plant, causing irreparable damage. Associated Press Share Comment Read Article DETROIT — General Motors has stopped doing business in Venezuela after authorities took control of its only factory there in what GM called an illegal judicial seizure of its assets. The plant was confiscated on Wednesday as anti-government protesters clashed with authorities in a country that is roiling in economic troubles such as food shortages and triple-digit inflation. The Detroit automaker said in a statement Thursday that other assets such as vehicles were taken from the plant, causing irreparable damage to the company. GM says the plant was taken in disregard of its right to due process. The company says it will defend itself legally and that it’s confident that justice eventually will prevail. GM has about 2,700 workers in the troubled country, where it’s been the market leader for over 35 years. It also has 79 dealers that employ 3,900 people, and its parts suppliers make up more than half of Venezuela’s auto parts market, the company said. If the government permits it, workers will get separation benefits “arising from the termination of employment relationships due to causes beyond the parties’ control,” the GM statement said. Dealers will continue to service vehicles and provide parts, the company said. GM’s Venezuelan operations have been a drag on earnings for several years. In the second quarter of 2015, the company took a $720 million charge for currency devaluation and asset valuation write-downs as the economy faltered. South American operations, which include Venezuela, account for a relatively small portion of GM’s earnings and sales. Last year the company lost $400 million before taxes in South America, but as a whole the company made a pretax profit of $12.5 billion. GM sold just over 583,000 vehicles in the region last year, but that was only about 6 percent of its total sales. In its 2016 fourth-quarter earnings release, the company said that its South America region “remains challenged from macro-economic and political standpoints.” Companies have been cutting operations in Venezuela as a result of runaway inflation and strict currency controls. Last May, tire maker Bridgestone sold its business there after six decades of operating in the country. Bridgestone joined other foreign multinationals including Halliburton, Ford Motor and Procter & Gamble who have either slowed or abandoned their investments in Venezuela. Shares of General Motors Co. rose slightly in premarket trading. Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

HONG KONG CHINA INTERNATIONAL EDITORIAL FEATURES LITURGY MASS SCHEDULES CONTACT US Home >> International CATHOLIC NEWS OF THE WEEK . Saturday, 15 April 2017 Print Version    Email to Friend Around the traps   Church out of kilter? DUBLIN (SE): Father Tony Flannery says that Catholic doctrine “no longer makes sense to the modern mind.” The Irishman has been silenced by the Vatican since 2012 over his public statements in opposition to the established Church. He said that Church teaching is routinely ignored or rejected even by practicing Catholics, because the Church has not adapted to modern times. In January, Father Flannery, who is one of the founders of the Association of Catholic Priests in Ireland, defied a Vatican directive by celebrating Mass and preaching in public.   Colombia braces for refugees from Venezuela BOGOTA (SE): The Church in Colombia is preparing to offer help to refugees from Venezuela, as the economic crisis there deepens. Bishop Victor Manuel Ochoa Cadavid told the Fides on April 5 that he is worried over the plight of Venezuela, where shortages of food have become acute and the threat of violence looms. He reported his diocese had already provided food and medical help for those who left their homes in 2015 and expects to see another surge in the near future. The Colombian bishop reported that he had met with his counterpart for in Venezuela.   Ratzinger Prize-winner authored way of cross VATICAN (SE): The first woman to receive the Ratzinger Prize for Theology, Anne-Marie Pelletier, authored the meditations for this year’s Good Friday way of the cross at the Colosseum in Rome, Vatican Radio reported. An expert in hermeneutics and biblical exegesis, she has dedicated most of her research to the theme of women in Christianity. Camillo Ruini described her as “a distinguished figure in contemporary French Catholicism… with deserved scientific prestige, a great and versatile cultural liveliness and an authentic dedication to causes of the highest importance for Christian witness in society.”   Thousands of undocumented Filipinos return from Saudi DUBAI (SE): Some 5,000 undocumented overseas Filipino workers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are expected to be flying home soon after the Saudi government implements its amnesty programme for undocumented migrants that took effect two weeks ago. “We will be setting up centres to process their papers so they can take advantage of the 90-day amnesty programme,” labour undersecretary, Dominador Say, told the media. A team of senior officials of the Department of Labour and Employment has been deployed to facilitate the processing of qualified Filipinos so they can avail themselves of the three-month amnesty.   Pope Francis’ use-by date? ROME (CWN): Pope Francis caused a stir in a crowd in Rome on April 8 by suggesting that he might not be around for the next World Youth Day in Panama in 2019. “I don’t know whether I will be there, but the pope will be in Panama!” the pontiff said, adding, “at my age, we are getting ready to leave the scene.” The pope is 80. Insiders at the Vatican say there are no particular concerns about his health, so whether he believes he may reach his use-by date by then or anticipates not being on this earth is anyone’s guess.   Discount blood at Vatican VATICAN (SE): The Vatican Museums have announced a special admission rate for blood donors. Blood donors at the Gemelli Hospital will receive a voucher that entitles them to a reduced admission rate, as well as a chance to jump the entry queue at the Vatican Museums. The project is running under the theme, Give blood and follow your artistic inclination.   Laundromat for homeless VATICAN (SE): The Vatican has opened a free laundromat for homeless people in Rome. The opening of the laundry follows several other programmes for the homeless begun under Pope Francis, including free showers, haircuts and medical care. The laundromat will be operated by the Sant’Egidio community. The equipment has been donated by the Whirlpool Corporation. The Vatican also recognised Procter & Gamble, which has been providing razors and shaving cream, and will now supply detergent.   Pope’s family in Disneyland VATICAN (SE): Robert Iger, the chairperson of the worldwide Walt Disney Company, greeted Pope Francis on March 30 after attending a general audience. Introducing his family, Iger said, “Holy Father I’m Robert Iger… and this is my family. Deepest respect for you. Your niece works for us in Buenos Aires.” “God bless you and please pray for me,” the pope replied with a broad smile.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 20 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Publicis Groupe: First Quarter 2017 Revenue PARIS–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Regulatory News: Publicis Groupe (Paris:PUB): April 20, 2017   €2,328 million Reported growth +1.6% Growth at constant currency -0.6% Organic growth -1.2%   Maurice Lévy, Chairman and CEO of Publicis Groupe: “Our first quarter figures send out faint but encouraging signals as to the Groupe’s situation. Although organic growth is slightly negative at -1.2%, this is an improvement on the fourth quarter of 2016. We expect Q2 to remain in negative territory, but to show an improvement compared with the first quarter. To measure performance adequately, organic growth needs to be put into perspective alongside the impact of past difficulties. Contribution of account wins to Q1 revenue illustrates a positive momentum. This momentum is encouraging in many respects: the implementation of The Power of One is generating positive feedback from clients; over 60 GCLs and CCLs (Groupe Client Leaders and Country Client Leaders) have been appointed; Razorfish has been combined with SapientNitro to form SapientRazorfish, a merger that is well under way with new teams appointed and simplification progressing. As a result, notable progress has been made in terms of new business. Instability continues to prevail in the international environment, causing companies to proceed with great caution despite strong balance sheets. Changes in the field of technology, in consumer behavior and in the media landscape have led companies to question their business models and marketing strategies. Our recent successes show that our investment in Sapient, our own business model, which has been influenced by innovation and our understanding of advertisers needs have put us in a strong position to help our clients overcome these difficult obstacles. Moreover, Publicis has been substantially transformed to enable us to provide our clients with even better “end-to-end” service in business transformation. I am all the more confident since we have also announced Publicis Groupe’s upcoming change of governance with Arthur Sadoun appointed CEO & Chairman of a Management Board which will be reinforced by the addition of Steve King to the Management Board currently comprised of with Jean-Michel Etienne and Anne-Gabrielle Heilbronner. I am very happy about the arrangement we have chosen, especially as this was the solution I advocated before the Nominations Committee and the Supervisory Board. As for myself, this results from Madame Badinter’s request, approved by the Supervisory Board. Should the shareholders so decide, I will become Chairman of the Supervisory Board to play an active part in the consolidating of our clients, providing support to our teams when and where I am needed. The second half of 2017 should see the Groupe posting a more usual level of growth and I have every confidence in our ability to achieve our 2018 objectives. The cash we generate enables us to improve the return to shareholders while managing our debt responsibly.” 1 – Q1 2017 REVENUE Publicis Groupe’s consolidated revenue in Q1 2017 was 2,328 million euro, up 1.6% from 2,291 million euro in 2016. Exchange rates had a positive impact of 50 million euro, i.e. the equivalent of 2.2% of Q1 2016 revenue. Net acquisitions contributed 14 million euro to revenue in Q1 2017, i.e. the equivalent of 0.6% of Q1 2016 revenue. Growth at constant exchange rates was -0.6%. Organic growth stood at -1.2% in the first quarter of 2017. It was adversely affected by more than 400 basis points due to past issues. Organic growth in Q1 2017 continued to be affected by the weakness of the FMCG sector. Conversely, it benefited from the continued growth of accounts awarded since Q2 2016, in particular those of Walmart, HPE, USAA and Asda. Breakdown of Q1 2017 revenue by region EUR   Revenue   Organic   Reported Million   Q1 2017   Q1 2016   growth   growth Europe 655   631 +5.5% +3.8% North America 1,291 1,301 -5.0% -0.8% Asia Pacific 243 230 +0.8% +5.7% Latin America 77 71 +4.5% +8.5% Middle East & Africa   62   58   +1.5%   +6.9% Total   2,328   2,291   -1.2%   +1.6%   Europe recorded growth of 3.8%. When the impact of acquisitions and exchange rates is factored out, organic growth stands at +5.5%. It is worth highlighting the good performance in France (+11.9%) and the dynamism of the UK and Italy (respectively +9.1% and +6.3%). Nonetheless, Germany was down 3.6% due to unfavorable basis of comparison. The situation has been recovering in Russia with a 20.4% growth. North America returned a revenue decline of 0.8% while recording organic growth of -5.0% due to the impact of past issues, at a time when new projects had not yet ramped up to their full potential. Asia Pacific reported growth of 5.7% (0.8% on an organic basis). China was up 2.6%. Activity in Singapore went up 7.3%. In India, we are consolidating our activity: after posting an increase of almost 9% in the first quarter of 2016, growth was 0.4% during the first three months of 2017. Latin America grew its revenue by 8.5% partly due to exchange rates as organic growth for the region was 4.5%. Activities in Brazil went down 1.7% and Mexico sustained a strong growth rate (+25.7%). The Middle East & Africa reported growth of 6.9% (1.5% on an organic basis). Breakdown of Q1 2017 revenue by region: Digital & Tech and Analog     Europe   North America   Asia Pacific   Latin America   Middle East & Africa   Total Digital & Tech   +4.8%   -5.3%   +9.4%   +13.0%   +38.8%   -1.3% Analog   +6.2%   -4.5%   -4.3%   +2.9%   -8.9%   -1.1% Total   +5.5%   -5.0%   +0.8%   +4.5%   +1.5%   -1.2%             Digital & Tech’s contribution to total revenue rose 1.4% to 1,273 million euro. Digital & Tech accounts for 55% of the Groupe’s revenue. 2 – NET DEBT At March 31, 2017, net debt amounted to 2,339 million euro, compared with 1,244 million euro at December 31, 2016. The Groupe’s average net debt at March 31, 2017 was 1,677 million euro, down 19.8% in twelve months by comparison with its average net debt of 2,092 million euro at March 31, 2016. 3 – HIGHLIGHTS OF THE FIRST QUARTER 2017 3.1 – Governance Maurice Levy’s succession plan as CEO & Chairman of the Management Board was announced on January 26, 2017. From June 1, 2017, Arthur Sadoun will take on the role of CEO & Chairman of the Management Board. Steve King, CEO of Publicis Media will also join the Management Board, alongside current members Jean-Michel Etienne, Executive Vice-President and CFO, and Anne-Gabrielle Heilbronner, Secretary General. To continue to develop the Groupe, the Management Board will be able to count on the collaboration of top quality leaders, Alan Wexler and Chip Register of Publicis.Sapient, Nick Colucci of Publicis Health, Jarek Ziebinski of Publicis One, as well as Rishad Tobaccowala, Publicis Groupe’s Strategy & Growth Officer, in the field of strategy and the client-centric approach. The Supervisory Board has proposed that, upon completion of his current term of office, Maurice Lévy join its ranks as Chairman. This motion will be put to a vote before the shareholders at their AGM on May 31, 2017. 3.2 – Acquisition In January 2017, Publicis Communications acquired two companies: The Abundancy and Ardent. These agencies will add to Leo Burnett’s growing arsenal of data, creative and technology capabilities. Ardent provides proprietary technology that uses search data to understand behavior and predict consumer intent, and The Abundancy applies these learnings to inform custom content. Together, they count sixty employees who have joined the Leo Burnett team, now under the leadership of Andrew Swinand in the US. 4 – OUTLOOK The implementation of One Company and the transformation from a “holding” to a “connecting” company are taking place according to the announced plan, with excellent feedback from clients regarding the new Power of One offering. Recent successes in client retention (GMC, Mars) as well as client and budget wins (Walmart, HPE, USAA, and HSBC) and re-gains (Kellog’s Special K) are promising signs that Publicis Groupe is ready to resume its growth. As announced, the second quarter of 2017 will remain affected by past issues, and new accounts momentum should allow the return to a more satisfactory organic growth rate in the second half of 2017. Thus the 2018 plan should materialize as expected. The One Company concept (“no silo, no solo”) developed by Publicis Groupe seems to be setting a trend, as well as the end-to-end approach from consulting to creativity through technology. Publicis Groupe’s lead should be favorable in the quarters to come. * * * Disclaimer Certain information contained in this document, other than historical information, may constitute forward-looking statements or unaudited financial forecasts.
