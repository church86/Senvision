THE INSIDER AUTHORITY ON GATOR SPORTS Florida Gators gymnastics celebrate a good 2016 season- GatorCountry photo taken by David Bowie Other Sports Pair of standout gymnasts sign with Florida Gators gymnastics Home Other Sports Pair of standout gymnasts sign with Florida Gators gymnastics Written by Andrew Spivey, November 9, 2016, 0 Comments, GAINESVILLE, Fla. - A pair of top gymnasts will join the Florida Gators gymnastics team for
the 2018 season, Gator head coach Jenny
Rowland announced Wednesday.

Megan Skaggs, a 2014-15 member of the U.S. Senior National Team, has been a part of
winning U.S. teams at the 2015 Pan American Games and City of Jesolo Trophy. Vanasia
Bradley (pronounced vuh-NAY-suh) was a top junior division elite level gymnast. She
missed two seasons recovering from injuries, but made her competitive return earlier
this year.

"Megan and Vanasia are both talented gymnasts. They will come in and be contributors
on each event," Rowland said. "I think overall their enthusiasm, determination,
excitement to come to college and start their new chapter in life is very
refreshing. I know they both bring a very strong work ethic and I feel like their
college careers are going to be very successful."

Eileen Spicker.

Coach Rowland says:
"She is a very talented athlete who unfortunately has been injured for some time.
Her senior year should be her first year back after two years of not competing. She
is a dynamic and powerful athlete. Vanasia is also very technically sound which will
be an asset for her collegiate routines. She should be a good contributor to us on
all the events. Vanasia should be able to jump right into vault and floor for us,
but believe that uneven bars is one of her best events. We are excited to have a
little more depth on bars next year."

very dedicated, methodical and loves gymnastics. Her grace is a stand-out aspect of
her gymnastics. She's a very elegant athlete to watch. Expect Megan to be a

Pause Add to MyNBR Radio 0 0:00 0:10 Play NBR radio on Wall Street advanced, with the Dow climbing to a record high, while US Treasurys slid, amid bets that US president-elect Donald Trump will spend more and regulate less. "People are going through the possibilities about what Washington looks like today and what Washington can do or not do for them," John Manley, chief equity strategist for Wells Fargo Funds Management in New York, told Bloomberg. "Corporations feel there's a less restrictive hand. People may take that as a positive." At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 218.19 points, or 1.2%, to 18,807.88. Earlier in the session it touched an all-time record high 18,810.58. The Dow's previous high was 18,636 on August 15 and is up more than 5% for the week The Standard & Poor's 500 Index added 0.2% to 2167.48 and is up 4% for the week. The Dow rose, led by advances in Pfizer and JPMorgan Chase, up 4.7% and 3.9% respectively. Bucking the trend, Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola declined 3.4% and 2.9% respectively. Tech stocks fall The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.6%, as shares of Amazon and Apple declined 3.5% and 2.3% respectively. "Tech stocks aren't really in the handbook," Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York, told Reuters. "They aren't really going to benefit from Trump's stimulus spending on infrastructure and are sort of sitting in the middle. "They aren't part of the oversold sectors such as banks and health nor are they high dividend paying stocks that [are] getting sold off." Also, some investors are concerned tech stocks might suffer from Trump's protectionist stance. The US dollar rose while Treasury yields fell amid bets a Trump presidency will bolster inflation, while the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. Bond yields rise Yields on the benchmark 10-year note rose four basis points to 2.10%, while yields on the 30-year bond climbed increased five basis points to 2.90%, according to Bloomberg. "The [US] dollar will do very well" on a broad trade-weighted basis in the next 12 months, Bilal Hafeez, global head of foreign-exchange research at Nomura Holdings in London, told Bloomberg. "The Fed will be increasing interest rates, the US will be engaging in fiscal stimulus of some kind, which is much-needed by economies around the world, so we'll have faster growth and more inflationary pressures." In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a 0.3% decline from the previous close. Germany's DAX Index fell 0.2%, France's CAC 40 Index declined 0.3%, while the UK's FTSE 100 Index shed 1.2%.

The athlete, who recently retired from the sport, was overwhelmed with hugs and drawings from hundreds of pupils as she took a tour around the school. “It’s been fantastic,” said Jessica. “It’s so nice to come to different areas and see how different schools work and how they incorporate sport into their school life. Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill visits Trumacar Primary School, in Heysham. “I’ve been showed around by six kids and they have been brilliant - lots of hugs, lots of letters and pictures they have drawn for me. It’s been really, really special. “We drove up earlier this morning and it was raining and horrible, but the school has a fantastic set-up and they’ve put a lot of time and energy in.” The mum-of-one is an ambassador for consumer goods company Procter & Gamble’s ‘Thank You Mum’ campaign. Their competition encouraged children to think about the support they receive from family, friends, teachers, or anyone else, and to celebrate the people who help us to believe in ourselves. Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill visits Trumacar Primary School, in Heysham. Trumacar created a display in their hall for the competition to celebrate the campaign. The school, on Combermere Road, was picked out of thousands of entries across the UK. “What an inspirational day,” said Paul Slater, headteacher at Trumacar Nursery and Community Primary School. “She is such a wonderful, positive role model for the children. “The children were so excited to meet her. “The way she has come across today is how she behaves on television, very warm and humble, she is just a genuine person.” Chris Beckett, sports teacher at Trumacar, and Mrs Moore applied for the competition earlier this year and were told of their success in July. Staff and classes from Reception to Year 6 have been waiting for the visit for a very long time. “I knew we had a good display but I didn’t think we would win,” said Mr Beckett. “I thought if we win, we win and when I got the email I was so excited I burst into the governors meeting to tell everyone. “Jessica is such a positive role model, she has been great with the kids today.” It was Jessica’s first time visiting Morecambe and the athlete gave a motivational speech to the school assembly before handing out certificates to each class. Jessica retired shortly after winning silver at this year’s Rio Olympics. The 30-year-old mum from Sheffield is also a double world champion. “I am a mum now and can appreciate the sacrifices and challenges and how hard it can be to be a mum,” said Jessica. “My mum took me to my first athletics club and encouraged me to do athletics, she has just been an absolute role model to me.” When asked about how she feels about being a role model Jessica said: “When you get involved in sport you do sport because you love it and you want to be the best you can be. “Then as you become a role model it is something that happens over time. “It is an incredible feeling because it is a huge responsibility but also a really nice position to be in. “What I do and what I love doing can hopefully inspire other kids and people around the country to keep active.” The double gold winning athlete also wanted to give some advice to those who aspire to have a career in sports. She said: “Try as many sports as you possibly can and just enjoy what you do. “Don’t feel the pressure of having to perform or trying to set too many targets. “You have to enjoy what you do, work hard and train hard and hopefully you will go on to achieve great things.” Sign in {* #userInformationForm *} Sign in socially {* loginWidget *} with your email address {* traditionalSignIn_emailAddress *} {* traditionalSignIn_password *} {* traditionalSignIn_signInButton *} Forgot your password?

(File photo) Many businesses believe Turkey’s strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Central Asia, and its skilled workforce is a winning formula. Turkey, a rising regional hub for manufacturers: The biggest car manufacturers have located factories in Turkey. One plant visited by Euronews produces buses mainly for export. German automaker Mercedes has made one of the largest foreign direct investments in Turkey. In 50 years, it has put more than 960 million euros on the table. Auto suppliers have developed the world’s most unique manufacturing zone: 300 hectares are home to 90 companies in the sector. This system generates an annual revenue of 2.5 billion. American multinational Procter & Gamble has been in Turkey for 30 years. A quarter of its production is exported. The rest goes to the young and dynamic domestic market. “Twenty-five percent of Turkish population is below 15 years old,” P&G Turkey CEO Tankut Turnaoglu told Euronews. “So that actually creates a really vibrant consumer market. And that combine with the upward mobility and the growth of the middle class makes turkey as one of the most attractive market global for consumer goods.” The company has invested 700 million dollars in Turkey. It injected 80 million in capital this year. It benefits from a supportive government framework and a favourable tax climate. “Some of those incentives are in the tax area, some of those incentives are in the input area, on the import and making some of those imports at lower costs for the company, makes it very interesting for companies like us to invest in Turkey,” added Turnaoglu. Turkey is in the top 20 of world economies and has its sights set on the top 10 within five years. Reaching this target required significant investment in the country’s infrastructure. A third airport is being built in Istanbul. And a new ultra modern sea port has been in operation for a few months.” Remote gantry cranes that load and unload containers from the largest container ships in the world. The fully-automated, computerised system provides a real boost to productivity. Eventually this port could give a new push to the Turkish economy, and thus create – a new bridge to Europe and Asia.

FACEBOOKEMAILDRUCKEN Kommentare Kommentar schreiben Top Themen Heute Merkel will angeblich zum vierten Mal Bundeskanzlerin werdenNachholbedarf: Warum Anleger auf Infrastruktur setzen solltenDas iPhone 8: Wenn alle Gerüchte stimmen, kommt 2017 das Hammer-iPhone Der überraschende Sieg von Donald Trump bei der Wahl zum US-Präsidenten hatte zur Wochenmitte wie zu vermuten zunächst zu einer extremen “Risk-off”-Bewegung an den globalen Finanzmärkten geführt. Doch stellte sich die anfängliche Panikreaktion als erstaunlich kurzlebig heraus. Der deutsche Aktienmarkt konnte sich nach einer deutlichen Abwärtslücke zur Eröffnung dynamisch erholen und beendete den Handelstag dann sogar mit deutlichen Zugewinnen. Der DAX schloss 1,56 Prozent höher bei 10.646 Punkten. Das Tief hatte der Leitindex bei 10.175 Punkten markiert. MDAX und TecDAX verbesserten sich um 0,23 beziehungsweise 1,18 Prozent. Unter den 110 größten Aktien gab es 75 Gewinner und 35 Verlierer. Das Aufwärtsvolumen lag bei 67 Prozent. Das Gesamtvolumen war extrem hoch. Im DAX wurden 173,8 Millionen Aktien im Wert von 6,47 Milliarden EUR (5-Tages-Durchschnitt: 2,92) umgesetzt. Am deutlichsten stiegen die Aktien aus den Bereichen Pharma + Healthcare sowie Bauwerte. Versorger und Immobilienwerte wurden hingegen gemieden. Als stärkster DAX-Wert haussierte Fresenius SE um 7,10 Prozent. Bayer verteuerte sich um 5,16 Prozent. Merck schloss 4,86 Prozent fester. Volkswagen büßte am Indexende 2,06 Prozent ein. Beiersdorf und Vonovia verloren 1,36 beziehungsweise 1,30 Prozent. An der Wall Street legte der Dow Jones Industrial um 1,40 Prozent auf 18.590 Punkte zu. Der von Technologiewerten geprägte Nasdaq 100 verbesserte sich um 0,42 Prozent auf 4.825 Punkte. 54 Prozent der Werte an der NYSE verzeichneten Zugewinne. 202 neue 52-Wochen-Hochs standen 119 neuen Tiefs gegenüber. Mit Blick auf die Sektorenperformance lagen Finanzwerte und Werte aus dem Gesundheitsbereich ganz vorne. Die größten Verlierer waren Versorger und Immobilienwerte. Um 7,69 Prozent sprang die Aktie von Caterpillar und setzte sich damit die Dow-Spitze. Dahinter folgten Pfizer (+7,06%) und Merck (+6,06%). Am anderen Indexende verloren die multinational agierenden Konzerne Procter & Gamble und Coca-Cola 1,74 respektive 1,42 Prozent. Auch am Währungsmarkt folgte einer anfänglichen Flucht in die sicheren Häfen eine beeindruckende Umkehrbewegung hin zu mehr Risikofreude. Der Dollar-Index notierte gegen Ende des New Yorker Handels mit 0,53 Prozent im Plus bei 98,48 Punkten. Im asiatischen Handel war er auf ein 5-Wochen-Tief bei 95,88 Punkten eingebrochen. Der Euro wertete gegenüber allen anderen Hauptwährungen mit Ausnahme des Austral-Dollars ab. EUR/USD fiel um 0,77 Prozent auf ein 2-Wochen-Tief bei 1,0941 USD. In der Spitze hatte das Währungspaar ein 2-Monats-Hoch bei 1,1300 USD markiert. Mit Blick auf die anderen Majors fielen das Pfund Sterling mit Stärke und der Austral-Dollar mit Schwäche auf. Trotz des am Ende des Tages festeren US-Dollars verteuerten sich die meisten Rohstoffe. Der S&P GSCI für 24 Spotpreise schloss 0,55 Prozent höher bei 356,58 Punkten. Ein etwas stärker als erwarteter Aufbau der Rohöllagerbestände in den USA belastete am Nachmittag nur kurzzeitig. Brent-Öl notierte gegen Ende des New Yorker Handels 0,93 Prozent höher bei 46,47 USD. Die US-Sorte WTI stieg um 0,67 Prozent auf 45,28 USD. Beide Sorten hatten am Morgen mit der allgemeinen “Risk-off”-Bewegung an den Märkten noch deutliche Abschläge gezeigt und neue Korrektur-Tiefs markiert. Der Preis für US-Erdgas stieg um 2,92 Prozent auf 2,71 USD. Kupfer haussierte an der Comex um 3,53 Prozent auf ein 14-Monats-Hoch bei 2,46 USD und bestätigte damit das Ausbruchssignal des Vortages. Gold war am Morgen als sicherer Hafen noch um rund 5 Prozent über 1.330 USD nach oben gesprungen, notierte jedoch am Abend knapp im Minus bei 1.273 USD (1.171 EUR). Platin verlor 0,75 Prozent. Silber und Palladium konnten um 0,10 beziehungsweise 1,98 Prozent zulegen. Auch am Rentenmarkt kam es zu extremen Kursausschlägen in beide Richtungen. Die Umlaufrendite stieg um zwei Basispunkte auf 0,00 Prozent. Die Rendite zehnjähriger Bundesanleihen war am Morgen auf ein Tief bei 0,09 Prozent gefallen. Die anschließende Rückkehr der Risikofreude beförderte sie am Ende um zwei Basispunkte nach oben auf 0,21 Prozent. Dies war der höchste Tagesschluss in 6 Monaten. Der Euro-Bund-Future schloss 0,53 Prozent niedriger bei 160,94 Punkten, einem neuen Kontrakt-Tief. Am Morgen war er noch mit der Flucht in die sicheren Häfen auf ein 2-Wochen-Hoch bei 163,19 Punkten geklettert. Die Rendite zehnjähriger US-Treasury Notes stieg um 19 Basispunkte beziehungsweise 10 Prozent auf ein 10-Monats-Hoch bei 2,07 Prozent. Die asiatischen Aktienmärkte tendierten heute früh auf breiter Front kräftig nordwärts. Der MSCI Asia Pacific Index sprang um 3,17 Prozent auf 137,67 Punkte. Für den Nikkei 225 ging es als regionalen Spitzenreiter um rund 6,6 Prozent nach oben. Schwache japanische Core-Machinery-Orders im September (-3,3%) wirkten sich nicht auf das Kursgeschehen aus. Heute richtet sich der Blick auf eine Flut an Quartalszahlen.

Picture: AFP Photo / Jewel Samad Dana McCauleynews.com.au@Dana_Adele Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend IT’S bigger than Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined. Welcome to Alibaba’s 11.11 Global Shopping Festival, the world’s biggest online sale, set to tally up to $US21 billion worth of sales by 40,000 merchants in just 24 hours. Kicking off at midnight on Thursday 10th November on Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group’s online platforms, this year’s Singles Day sale is expected to be the biggest yet. In Australia, we’ll have to wait until 7pm AEDST on Friday 11th November to be able to shop the sales on Aliexpress. With basketball star Kobe Bryant headlining a star-studded, televised four-hour countdown gala orchestrated by Hollywood producer David Hill — known for his work on the Oscars, NFL Super Bowls and American Idol — the event aims to capture global attention and demonstrate Alibaba’s vision for the future of retail. The countdown begins on Thursday night at 8pm local time in China at the Shenzhen Universiade Sports Center, a huge stadium that seats more than 60,000 people. When the clock strikes midnight, the retail frenzy will begin as millions of online purchases take place, with sales figures projected on a giant screen at the venue. Katy Perry cancelled her performance due to a family emergency. Picture: Kevin Tachman / WireimageSource:Supplied ‘A WORLD FIRST’ Alibaba Group Chief Marketing Officer Chris Tung called the gala “a global carnival, a world-class performance that involves the audience throughout the event with many touch points and is like nothing else you have experienced.” In the three weeks leading up to the event, Alibaba has been rolling out hi-tech innovations that bring virtual reality and gaming into the customer experience. The company kicked off its Singles Day promotions last month with a live streamed, eight-hour fashion show that attracted more than six million viewers. Shoppers were able to order in real time after spotting creations from brands including Burberry, GAP, Levi’s, La Perla, Paul Smith, New Balance and Under Armour on the catwalk. At tonight’s gala, audience members will be invited to shake their phones to win prizes and even vote on how segments of the event are played out with an interactive, choose-your-own-adventure style app. Outside the venue, shoppers using a Pokemon Go-style game will be invited to chase Tmall’s cat mascot around to win prizes from merchants including Shanghai Disneyland and Starbucks, driving foot traffic to Tmall vendors’ shops in the real world as part of a drive to integrate the online and offline shopping experience. And the world’s first end-to-end virtual reality shopping experience this year allows 11.11 shoppers to browse, order and pay for goods through a VR headset at Macy’s, Target, Costco, P & G, Chemist Warehouse, Freedom foods, Tokyo Otaku Mode, Matsumoto Kiyoshi.

Watch how everything, from perusal to purchase, takes place inside a VR environment. pic.twitter.com/JvYfOYokqF— Alibaba Group (@AlibabaGroup) October 20, 2016 BIRTH OF A FESTIVAL Alibaba founder Jack Ma started using Singles Day, an unofficial Chinese holiday celebrating single people, to promote sales on its local B2C platform Tmall in 2009. Locally known as the “bare sticks holiday” because of how it looks numerically, Singles Day began as an antidote to Valentine’s Day in the 1990s by students at Nanjing University, who bought presents for each other to celebrate their bachelordom. Now it is the world’s biggest online shopping festival, with last year’s event selling $14.3 billion worth of goods in 24 hours — up 55 per cent on the 2014 results. This year, an estimated 1.7 million couriers and postal workers are on standby to deliver about 760 million packages from 5000 warehouses to hundreds of millions of Chinese and international shoppers — including Australians, who can shop on Aliexpress, an English language eBay rival that sells everything from fast fashion to smartphone accessories, kids’ toys and camping gear. AUSTRALIA REPRESENTS Hundreds of Australian businesses are set to profit from the Double 11 festivities, with access China’s 600 million online shoppers through their stores on Tmall Global. More than 1,300 local brands already sell through the platform, including a2 milk, Devondale, and Blackmores, making Australia the fifth biggest seller country in the world. Jessica Rudd has a popular Tmall store called Jessica’s Closet, which sells women’s and baby products, while a range of Australian brands sell on Tmall through a partnership with Australia Post, such as beauty subscription service Bellabox. Chemist’s Warehouse was the star performer last year, while sales of Bellamy’s Organic baby formula were so strong on Singles Day that the shopping festival was blamed for a shortage that cleared the shelves of Australian supermarkets.

Picture: ReutersSource:Reuters A GLOBAL VISION While Alibaba’s Singles Day sales are still largely dominated by Chinese buyers, Mr Ma’s vision is for the event — and the Alibaba Group itself — to become truly global. The Alibaba Group, which comprises e-commerce, cloud computing, payments, marketing, media and entertainment companies worth a collective $257 billion, this year overtook Walmart as the world’s largest retailer. Through its new Melbourne office, the company is ramping up its Australian presence and reaching out to local vendors and customers. During the G20 meeting in Hangzhou in September, Mr Ma signed a deal with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to make it easier for Australian small businesses to sell into China, including B2B sales on 1688.com and an annual Australian fresh food week sales promotion on its food platform, Tmall Fresh. “Our vision is in 10 years, we will help two billion consumers in the world shop online,” Mr Ma announced last year. “Our globalisation will still be focusing on helping small businesses and helping them do business in the most efficient way.” Dana McCauley is in China as a guest of Alibaba dana.mccauley@news.com.au Alibaba Targets India in Bid to Boost Growth1:55 Following its expansion into Southeast Asia, Alibaba is targeting India in an effort to increase revenue as the Chinese e-commerce giant faces tough competition at home.

Jean MarbellaContact ReporterThe Baltimore Sun Political rifts took their strain on marriages and friendships, what happens now that the election is over? Three priests stood outside a polling place Tuesday in Timonium pondering the sacred and the secular. "My congregation has a bunch of families divided — it's a microcosm of the larger country," said the Rev. Kristofer Lindh-Payne, rector of Epiphany Episcopal Church in Baltimore County. "We do stay together, even though we are divided," he said, as voters streamed in and out of Pot Spring Elementary School. "But what will the aftermath be like, if no matter who wins, a large part of our country is going to be grieving?" The presidential campaign has been so bruising and divisive that Lindh-Payne and other priests made themselves available in polling places, churches and other venues for voters who needed a healing prayer or two. Husbands and wives, parents and children, office mates, real-life and Facebook friends have found themselves on opposite sides — with the ballots they cast Tuesday not necessarily resolving the standoff. Hillary Clinton wins Maryland easily Michael Dresser Hillary Clinton scored a thumping victory Tuesday over Donald Trump in Maryland on the strength of Democratic votes in the state's urban regions.

Hillary Clinton scored a thumping victory Tuesday over Donald Trump in Maryland on the strength of Democratic votes in the state's urban regions. Maryland was one of the first states called in the presidential race after the polls closed at 8 p.m. Never regarded as a battleground state, it received... (Michael Dresser) "I get to cancel out my husband," Jan Keadle said of her vote for Hillary Clinton. Keadle, 57, ran the mile or so from her house to Pot Spring Elementary, having tucked a small American flag into her headband and wearing matching shorts. It was a festive day for many across the state. But for politically mixed marriages like hers, Keadle, a mother of two who works for a printing company and runs marathons, domestic peace required a certain diplomacy — if not outright avoidance. "There was a lot of changing of the subject — 'OK, let's cut it off here,' " Keadle said. "We had to cut it off in the bedroom." Chris Van Hollen wins Maryland's open Senate seat, will succeed Barbara A. Mikulski John Fritze Rep. Chris Van Hollen won Maryland's open Senate seat Tuesday, capping a nearly two-year campaign in which the seven-term Democratic lawmaker argued that his ability to navigate a polarized Congress would enable him to carry on the legacy of his popular predecessor.

Chris Van Hollen won Maryland's open Senate seat Tuesday, capping a nearly two-year campaign in which the seven-term Democratic lawmaker argued that his ability to navigate a polarized Congress would enable him to carry on the legacy of his popular predecessor. The 57-year-old Montgomery County... (John Fritze) Similarly, another voter at Pot Spring, Jerry Wojtowycz, 60, said he and his golfing and fishing buddies kept the peace by avoiding talk of politics. "We decided we couldn't convince each other to vote for the opponent," said the retired Procter and Gamble tech services worker, a Trump supporter. "We basically stayed away from it." After such an angry campaign season, there was palpable relief in the civic ritual of voting. "We're ready for this to be over, and hopefully the result will be conclusive and we can move on," said Mildred Charles, 43, of Upper Marlboro. She participated in early voting, casting her ballot for Clinton a few days ago so she could spend Tuesday promoting a Prince George's County school board candidate. "At first, it was entertaining. I watched all the debates. I pulled out the popcorn," Charles, an adjunct communications professor, said of the campaign. "It's no longer entertainment. This is serious." She now feels differently about a childhood friend who ardently supports Trump, and maintained a silence-is-golden stance toward her husband, who said he remained undecided as late as Tuesday morning. Joseph Butler, 62, liked some of Trump's truth-telling — although he also thought it went too far. "It's only brought up the ugliness in people that's always been there," he said. But he said the national airing of grievances will be cathartic, a necessary step before anyone can try to heal the rift. "It's therapy for the country," Butler said. In Hagerstown, a couple supporting Trump also welcomed the end of the campaign. "With the way the mainstream press has covered this, it has been nonstop — you couldn't avoid it," said Brian Robak, 43, as he and his wife, Rae, 35, left their polling place. Robak, a business owner, decried what he considered the "overwhelming" pro-Clinton bias of their 12-year-old son's teachers. Rae Robak, who teaches grade school in West Virginia, found a decided anti-Clinton sentiment there. She decided to stop teaching government and civics in class over the last few weeks because "every time I did, things blew up. "You should have heard what they've been saying," she said " 'Hillary's a killer,' 'Hillary will take our religion away,' 'Hillary's worthless.' It has been almost scary. I decided, 'Let's focus on science for a few weeks. We'll come back to social studies after the election.'" In this most dyspeptic of campaigns, there were voters who were dissatisfied with both choices on the ballot. None of the above, or at least none of the major candidates, was Edwina Harlee's choice at Hazelwood Elementary/Middle School in Northeast Baltimore. "If I had voted for either of them, I would have sold my soul to the devil," said Harlee, 33, who works for a medication delivery service. For many, the campaign raised issues that were deeply personal — from the kind of sexual harassment Trump was accused of, to the question of what to do about immigration. The latter was a concern for John Zaunfuchs, a 56-year-old Republican, who voted for Trump at Goldsboro Fire Hall in rural Caroline County on the Eastern Shore. He's met immigrants in his community of Marydel and is concerned about those who aren't learning English or trying to assimilate into American culture. "They're good people, but there's a right way and a wrong way," said Zaunfuchs, who is semiretired from the printing industry. In immigrant-rich Montgomery County, the issue was particularly personal, especially among Hispanics. Clinton won the support of Gloria Y. Arevalo, a 27-year-old paralegal, and her mother, Gloria M. Arevalo, 58, a cook for the Montgomery County school system who moved to the United States years ago from El Salvador. They voted at James Hubert Blake High School in Silver Spring. Trump's rhetoric about building a wall on the country's southern border helped make their decision an easy one. "Donald Trump wants to get rid of all Mexicans or all Hispanics in general," the younger Arevalo said. "In general, we don't want to see families separated. It's not a good thing. People are coming here looking for a better life." But another immigrant, J.D. Chawla, a 49-year-old financial planner who says he has "an American flag carved inside my heart," cast his vote for Trump. Originally from India, he and his wife, Tammy, brought their 8- and 12-year-old children to the polls to witness what he calls "a very pivotal election." "It changes the dynamic of the future of this country and the economics of this country and the track that we will end up taking significantly," Chawla said. Like others across the state, he worries about what will happen after the polls close and a victor emerges. He predicted a Clinton victory would leave the country divided. "I think the rift will continue, because there's a sense of despair among many," he said. "There's a sense of, 'No, not this again for another four years,' and possibly even eight years." Richard Sherrill, 77, similarly expressed a bleak outlook at odds with the rolling countryside surrounding his polling place, the Veronica "Roni" Chenowith Activity Center in Fallston in Harford County. "The Constitution will be ignored if one candidate wins — Hillary," the retiree said. "If [Trump] loses, I will wear black on Wednesday. And a flag pin upside down." In counterpoint was the thrill others felt at the prospect of the nation's electing its first female president. "It would let women and young girls see that you can reach for the stars," said Tanya McAllister, 40, of Timonium, the controller at an area staffing firm. That sentiment, though, was tempered by her lingering concerns over Clinton's using a private server for her emails, the subject of an investigation that kept popping up as late as last week. And yet, she said, the idea of Trump as president was worse. "The face of the country is at stake," she said.

Picture: AFP Photo / Jewel Samad Retail Inside the world’s biggest shopping event Dana McCauley, news.com.auNovember 11, 2016 3:17pm IT’S bigger than Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined. Welcome to Alibaba’s 11.11 Global Shopping Festival, the world’s biggest online sale, set to tally up to $US21 billion worth of sales by 40,000 merchants in just 24 hours. Kicking off at midnight on Thursday 10th November on Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group’s online platforms, this year’s Singles Day sale is expected to be the biggest yet. In Australia, we’ll have to wait until 7pm AEDST on Friday 11th November to be able to shop the sales on Aliexpress. With basketball star Kobe Bryant headlining a star-studded, televised four-hour countdown gala orchestrated by Hollywood producer David Hill — known for his work on the Oscars, NFL Super Bowls and American Idol — the event aims to capture global attention and demonstrate Alibaba’s vision for the future of retail. The countdown begins on Thursday night at 8pm local time in China at the Shenzhen Universiade Sports Center, a huge stadium that seats more than 60,000 people. When the clock strikes midnight, the retail frenzy will begin as millions of online purchases take place, with sales figures projected on a giant screen at the venue. media_cameraKaty Perry cancelled her performance due to a family emergency. Picture: Kevin Tachman / Wireimage ‘A WORLD FIRST’ Alibaba Group Chief Marketing Officer Chris Tung called the gala “a global carnival, a world-class performance that involves the audience throughout the event with many touch points and is like nothing else you have experienced.” In the three weeks leading up to the event, Alibaba has been rolling out hi-tech innovations that bring virtual reality and gaming into the customer experience. The company kicked off its Singles Day promotions last month with a live streamed, eight-hour fashion show that attracted more than six million viewers. Shoppers were able to order in real time after spotting creations from brands including Burberry, GAP, Levi’s, La Perla, Paul Smith, New Balance and Under Armour on the catwalk. At tonight’s gala, audience members will be invited to shake their phones to win prizes and even vote on how segments of the event are played out with an interactive, choose-your-own-adventure style app. Outside the venue, shoppers using a Pokemon Go-style game will be invited to chase Tmall’s cat mascot around to win prizes from merchants including Shanghai Disneyland and Starbucks, driving foot traffic to Tmall vendors’ shops in the real world as part of a drive to integrate the online and offline shopping experience. And the world’s first end-to-end virtual reality shopping experience this year allows 11.11 shoppers to browse, order and pay for goods through a VR headset at Macy’s, Target, Costco, P & G, Chemist Warehouse, Freedom foods, Tokyo Otaku Mode, Matsumoto Kiyoshi.

Watch how everything, from perusal to purchase, takes place inside a VR environment. pic.twitter.com/JvYfOYokqF— Alibaba Group (@AlibabaGroup) October 20, 2016 BIRTH OF A FESTIVAL Alibaba founder Jack Ma started using Singles Day, an unofficial Chinese holiday celebrating single people, to promote sales on its local B2C platform Tmall in 2009. Locally known as the “bare sticks holiday” because of how it looks numerically, Singles Day began as an antidote to Valentine’s Day in the 1990s by students at Nanjing University, who bought presents for each other to celebrate their bachelordom. Now it is the world’s biggest online shopping festival, with last year’s event selling $14.3 billion worth of goods in 24 hours — up 55 per cent on the 2014 results. This year, an estimated 1.7 million couriers and postal workers are on standby to deliver about 760 million packages from 5000 warehouses to hundreds of millions of Chinese and international shoppers — including Australians, who can shop on Aliexpress, an English language eBay rival that sells everything from fast fashion to smartphone accessories, kids’ toys and camping gear. AUSTRALIA REPRESENTS Hundreds of Australian businesses are set to profit from the Double 11 festivities, with access China’s 600 million online shoppers through their stores on Tmall Global. More than 1,300 local brands already sell through the platform, including a2 milk, Devondale, and Blackmores, making Australia the fifth biggest seller country in the world. Jessica Rudd has a popular Tmall store called Jessica’s Closet, which sells women’s and baby products, while a range of Australian brands sell on Tmall through a partnership with Australia Post, such as beauty subscription service Bellabox. Chemist’s Warehouse was the star performer last year, while sales of Bellamy’s Organic baby formula were so strong on Singles Day that the shopping festival was blamed for a shortage that cleared the shelves of Australian supermarkets. media_cameraAn employee at an Alibaba Tmall logistic centre getting ready for the event in 2015. Picture: Reuters A GLOBAL VISION While Alibaba’s Singles Day sales are still largely dominated by Chinese buyers, Mr Ma’s vision is for the event — and the Alibaba Group itself — to become truly global. The Alibaba Group, which comprises e-commerce, cloud computing, payments, marketing, media and entertainment companies worth a collective $257 billion, this year overtook Walmart as the world’s largest retailer. Through its new Melbourne office, the company is ramping up its Australian presence and reaching out to local vendors and customers. During the G20 meeting in Hangzhou in September, Mr Ma signed a deal with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to make it easier for Australian small businesses to sell into China, including B2B sales on 1688.com and an annual Australian fresh food week sales promotion on its food platform, Tmall Fresh. “Our vision is in 10 years, we will help two billion consumers in the world shop online,” Mr Ma announced last year. “Our globalisation will still be focusing on helping small businesses and helping them do business in the most efficient way.” Dana McCauley is in China as a guest of Alibaba dana.mccauley@news.com.au Alibaba Targets India in Bid to Boost Growth1:55 Following its expansion into Southeast Asia, Alibaba is targeting India in an effort to increase revenue as the Chinese e-commerce giant faces tough competition at home.

Sliva as President and Director, announces executive promotions Meat and Poultry Industry News AdvancePierre Foods appoints Christopher D. Sliva as President and Director, announces executive promotions November 10, 2016 Industry News KEYWORDS advancepierre Reprints No Comments AdvancePierre Foods, a national producer and distributor of sandwiches, sandwich components and other entrées and snacks, announced that its Board of Directors has approved a succession and transition plan for its Chief Executive Officer position. As a part of the plan, the Board announced that effective November 14, 2016, Christopher D. Sliva will be appointed President and also will join the AdvancePierre Board of Directors. On March 31, 2017, current AdvancePierre Chief Executive Officer John Simons will retire and will be succeeded by Sliva. Simons will remain a member of AdvancePierre’s Board following the transition. Additionally, AdvancePierre announced the promotions of George Chappelle and Jim Clough. Chappelle, previously Senior Vice President, Supply Chain & Corporate Development, has been appointed Chief Operating Officer. Chappelle will be responsible for overseeing the company’s manufacturing operations and supply chain as well as all business development activities including acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic projects. Currently President of the Foodservice business unit, Clough will expand his role and become the company’s first Chief Commercial Officer. Clough will continue to lead the Foodservice business unit as President and will have additional leadership responsibilities related to the company’s customer-centric efforts. Both of these promotions reflect the Company’s ongoing commitment to these critical business functions and their contributions to AdvancePierre. Regarding Simons’ transition, Dean Hollis, Chairman of the Board, said, “John has been instrumental in transforming AdvancePierre’s culture into one focused on collaboration and excellence and in building a world-class management team. Under John’s leadership, AdvancePierre has implemented the APF way, our sustainable improvement program which transformed our business performance and enhanced our margin profile. We look forward to continuing to benefit from John’s experience and guidance as Chief Executive Officer throughout the transition period.” Simons commented, “AdvancePierre is on a solid and steady path for continued success. I’m extremely proud of our team’s many accomplishments over the past several years, perhaps most notably around our successful NYSE debut and the work that followed to establish AdvancePierre on strong footing as a public company. For all of these reasons, I came to the decision that now is the right time to initiate this change, and the Board agreed that a smooth transition beginning with Chris’ appointment as President was the ideal next step. I am looking forward to working alongside Chris over the coming months, and I am confident that the future is bright for AdvancePierre.” As President, Sliva will work closely alongside Simons on the oversight and management of the company’s operating activities and to ensure a seamless transition of responsibilities. Sliva is a recognized leader and operator with over a decade’s experience as a public food company executive. Before joining AdvancePierre, Sliva was President and Chief Operating Officer at TreeHouse Foods Inc., a leading manufacturer of food and beverage products with more than 50 manufacturing facilities across the United States, Canada and Italy. Sliva joined TreeHouse in July 2012 as Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of its Bay Valley Foods operating unit and also served as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of TreeHouse and President of Bay Valley during his time at the company. Before that, Sliva spent six years as an executive at Dean Foods, including as Chief Commercial Officer of Dean’s subsidiary Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar, Chief Customer Officer for Dean's White Wave Foods division and President and Chief Operating Officer for the Morningstar division. Previously, Sliva held various leadership roles and sales and marketing positions with Eastman Kodak Company, Fort James Corporation and Procter & Gamble Distributing Company. Hollis continued, “I am very pleased to welcome Chris to AdvancePierre. Having spent a significant part of his career working in a customer-focused environment, Chris is well-equipped to reinforce and build upon AdvancePierre’s customer-centric approach. Chris also shares our passion for food and his highly relevant experience as a senior executive with publicly-traded food and beverage companies strongly positions him to lead AdvancePierre through its next phase of growth.” Sliva said, “I have watched AdvancePierre’s amazing progress over the past several years and I admire the spirit of collaboration, innovation and continuous improvement deeply-rooted in every aspect of the business. I am excited to work with John and the rest of the talented team during this transition period as we strive to deliver even greater value for customers and sustained profitable growth and value for shareholders.” Source: AdvancePierre Foods Did you enjoy this article?

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases pr @ satprnews.com Febreze Revives “The #12Stinks of Christmas” with Doug E. Fresh and Doug The Pug So You Can Breathe Happy Again This Holiday Season Febreze is Bringing Back Its Holiday Hit, “The #12Stinks of Christmas,” With a Throwback to Old School Hip-Hop in a Music Video Showcasing How to Keep it Funky Fresh All Season Long CINCINNATI–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Mom burnt the casserole, dad left the trash in the garage, and Uncle Jeff has been in the bathroom a little too long – being home for the holidays isn’t always what we imagine. Don’t get us wrong, the holidays are great, but in reality, they can literally stink. Febreze is here to spread cheer and freshness all season long, and to help them do so they have brought back their holiday hit: “The #12Stinks of Christmas.” Today, Doug E. Fresh, “The World’s Greatest Entertainer,” and social media sensation @ItsDougThePug kicked it old school and released the second installment of Febreze’s “The #12Stinks of Christmas.” The beatbox pioneer and his four-legged #12Stinks partner-in-crime put their own spin on the holiday classic, “The 12 Days of Christmas,” with a hip-hop music video collaboration-complete with matching track suits of course! Their video brings to life the stinks of the season and highlights how Febreze is the only solution tough enough to eliminate unwanted holiday odors while leaving behind a light, fresh holiday scent that keeps you guest-ready all season long. This year’s collaboration follows the success of the 2015 version starring Jane Lynch and Matthew Morrison and is being launched in tandem with the brand’s 2016 global #12Stinks campaign, including a U.K. rendition starring British comedian, Paul O’Grady. “I love to entertain and I love to keep things fresh – it’s what I do! But sometimes, when it comes to entertaining guests, things can get pretty stressful,” said legendary beatboxer, Doug E. Fresh. “Nobody has time to worry about the smell of their home when they have friends and family over. That’s why I love Febreze – it’s the perfect solution to eliminate those not-so-fresh holiday stinks no matter how big the party gets.” In addition to the music video featured on YouTube, the duo also will be featured in a full “The #12Stinks of Christmas” digital campaign including iRadio ads, Snapchat, digital ads and special content on the brand’s social channels. You can find the hip-hop remix of “The #12Stinks of Christmas” staring Doug E. Fresh and @ItsDougthePUG all season long on Febreze’s YouTube channel, beginning today: YouTube.com/Febreze.

November 10, 2016 Brian Taylor Subscribe 2016 Paper & Plastics Recycling Conference Show Dailies International Recycling News Plastics The Plastic Heroes program is providing a considerable subsidy to plastic scrap collection in the Netherlands, but a low pricing environment may cause taxpayers to wonder about their return on the investment.   Speaking at the 2016 Plastics Recycling Conference Europe in Rotterdam in early November, Thijs Cox of Netherlands-based recycling firm Ciparo BV said through the programme the Dutch government is paying local governments up to €1,100 ($1,200) per tonne for plastic scrap with as little as one-tenth of the value.   Having started his presentation to the music of David Bowies’s song “Heroes,” Cox asked of the programme, “Will it stay, or is it just for one day?” The programme has been in place for more than three years, he said, and it collected about 104,000 tonnes of plastic in 2013, 118,000 tonnes in 201 and 122,000 tonnes in 2015.   The Plastic Heroes programme is partially funded by fees paid into a fund by consumer products and packaging companies, but he said a combination of processing (sorting) and profitability challenges are leading to questions.   Cox’s fellow panelist Peter Daalder of Netherlands-based Daly Plastics BV is one skeptic of the programme, remarking that politicians are already expressing the views of some taxpayers that the Recycling Heroes programme is not fiscally sustainable.   Daly Plastics has recently invested in its capacity to recycle plastic films and bags, collected from commercial and industrial customers in the Netherlands and surrounding countries.   Daalder said Daly Plastics is not only collecting and baling the material, but also converting and processing much of it into granulate. The company has expanded its former 20,000-tonnes-per-year granulating output to 30,000 with the addition of a new processing line. Daly has a production goal of 50,000 tonnes produced in 2018, said Daalder.   He noted that one large customer such as Procter & Gamble may need 40,000 tonnes per year of just one grade of plastic, so recyclers continue to face an uphill battle to match the scale of primary resin producers.   Panelist Roger Evans of United Kingdom-based Recapture Plastics has spent four decades taking part in plastics recycling ventures in that nation. Recapture is targeting mixed rigid plastics containers for recycling and reprocessing and has secured financing from a variety of sources to equip a plant with 16,000 tonnes of annual capacity.   Evans said many challenges exist in the current plastic recycling landscape, including resin pricing volatility and, for post-consumer packaging, the often poor quality of materials collected in residential recycling programmes.   Low resin prices and past plastics recycling failures made financing his current venture difficult, Evans noted. Just 5% of his funding came from banks, while 8% came from equipment vendors and 28% from asset financing, including a mortgage on his own home. “If you’re going to do this,” he warned fellow attendees, “be prepared to risk your wealth, health and personal well-being.”   The 2016 Paper and Plastics Recycling Conferences Europe were 2-3 November at the Hilton Rotterdam in the Netherlands.

Sliva As President And Director by AdvancePierre Foods Posted: Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 3:47PM EST CINCINNATI -- AdvancePierre Foods (NYSE:APFH) (“AdvancePierre”), a leading national producer and distributor of sandwiches, sandwich components and other entrées and snacks, today announced that its Board of Directors has approved a succession and transition plan for its Chief Executive Officer position. As a part of the plan, the Board announced that effective November 14, 2016, Christopher D. Sliva will be appointed President and also will join the AdvancePierre Board of Directors. On March 31, 2017, current AdvancePierre Chief Executive Officer John Simons will retire and will be succeeded by Sliva. Simons will remain a member of AdvancePierre’s Board following the transition. Additionally, AdvancePierre today announced the promotions of George Chappelle and Jim Clough. Chappelle, previously Senior Vice President, Supply Chain & Corporate Development, has been appointed Chief Operating Officer. Chappelle will be responsible for overseeing the company’s manufacturing operations and supply chain as well as all business development activities including acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic projects. Currently President of the Foodservice business unit, Clough will expand his role and become the company’s first Chief Commercial Officer. Clough will continue to lead the Foodservice business unit as President and will have additional leadership responsibilities related to the company’s customer-centric efforts. Both of these promotions reflect the Company’s ongoing commitment to these critical business functions and their contributions to AdvancePierre. Regarding Simons’ transition, Dean Hollis, Chairman of the Board, said: “John has been instrumental in transforming AdvancePierre’s culture into one focused on collaboration and excellence and in building a world-class management team. Under John’s leadership, AdvancePierre has implemented the APF way, our sustainable improvement program which transformed our business performance and enhanced our margin profile. We look forward to continuing to benefit from John’s experience and guidance as Chief Executive Officer throughout the transition period.” Simons commented: “AdvancePierre is on a solid and steady path for continued success. I’m extremely proud of our team’s many accomplishments over the past several years, perhaps most notably around our successful NYSE debut and the work that followed to establish AdvancePierre on strong footing as a public company. For all of these reasons, I came to the decision that now is the right time to initiate this change, and the Board agreed that a smooth transition beginning with Chris’ appointment as President was the ideal next step. I am looking forward to working alongside Chris over the coming months, and I am confident that the future is bright for AdvancePierre.” As President, Sliva will work closely alongside Simons on the oversight and management of the company’s operating activities and to ensure a seamless transition of responsibilities. Sliva is a recognized leader and operator with over a decade’s experience as a public food company executive. Before joining AdvancePierre, Sliva was President and Chief Operating Officer at TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (NYSE:THS), a leading manufacturer of food and beverage products with more than 50 manufacturing facilities across the United States, Canada and Italy. Sliva joined TreeHouse in July 2012 as Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of its Bay Valley Foods operating unit and also served as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of TreeHouse and President of Bay Valley during his time at the company. Before that, Sliva spent six years as an executive at Dean Foods (NYSE:DF), including as Chief Commercial Officer of Dean’s subsidiary Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar, Chief Customer Officer for Dean's White Wave Foods division and President and Chief Operating Officer for the Morningstar division. Previously, Sliva held various leadership roles and sales and marketing positions with Eastman Kodak Company, Fort James Corporation and Procter & Gamble Distributing Company. Hollis continued: “I am very pleased to welcome Chris to AdvancePierre. Having spent a significant part of his career working in a customer-focused environment, Chris is well-equipped to reinforce and build upon AdvancePierre’s customer-centric approach. Chris also shares our passion for food and his highly relevant experience as a senior executive with publicly-traded food and beverage companies strongly positions him to lead AdvancePierre through its next phase of growth.” Sliva said: “I have watched AdvancePierre’s amazing progress over the past several years and I admire the spirit of collaboration, innovation and continuous improvement deeply-rooted in every aspect of the business. I am excited to work with John and the rest of the talented team during this transition period as we strive to deliver even greater value for customers and sustained profitable growth and value for shareholders.” About AdvancePierre Foods AdvancePierre Foods Holdings, Inc.

Half Of Razors Sold At Target Now From Harry’s Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Half Of Razors Sold At Target Now From Harry’s Image courtesy of hodad66 November 9, 2016 5:33 pm EST By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup razor wars harry's gilette target Earlier this year, Harry’s, the online razor subscription service that isn’t Dollar Shave Club, began selling its products in Target stores. The startup put up cool displays shaped like a giant orange razor, and soon half of the razor handles sold at Target were from Harry’s. One-tenth of the blade cartridges sold were from Harry’s. Dominant razor seller Gillette was not pleased. After the displays come down and Harry’s products go back on the regular shelf with other brands, sales will probably fall again. What’s interesting, though, is the reason why the products came to Target in the first place. Target wanted to bring back shoppers who have been buying a lot of their consumables online, and Harry’s was looking for new places to retail its razors. The partnership worked, based on each company’s research about its own customers. Harry’s knew that its main customers, men, would rather buy razors and blades in person, but don’t like the price points and products available in regular stores. Target shoppers, meanwhile, were looking for “something different,” according to the chain’s vice president of beauty and personal care. “We think Harry’s is filling a niche that wasn’t currently being met.” Meanwhile, Procter & Gamble’s Gillette saw its sales fall during the Harry’s promotion, and the company now realizes that it needs to watch its back, especially now that subscription blade company Dollar Shave Club has the backing of its rival consumer products conglomerate, Unilever. Gillette now has its own subscription service, but is that enough to stay competitive when the new competitors are right there on store shelves too?

What Trump's win means for companies, local economy Alexander Coolidge , acoolidge@enquirer.com 4:50 p.m. EST November 9, 2016 U.S. President-elect Donald Trump smiles as he arrives to speak at an election night rally, early Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016, in New York. (Photo: AP/Evan Vucci) Donald Trump's election win to become the 45th president of the United States has profound implications for Greater Cincinnati's economy and local companies. Local business observers say Trump has yet to fill in many blanks to reveal his policies on trade, government spending and health care. Trump won in part on a campaign that tapped voters' economic anxieties. Three areas where Trump's policies will have a big impact in the regional economy are trade, the financial sector and health care. The finance and insurance industries represent nearly 21 percent of Greater Cincinnati's $127 billion economy and almost 7 percent of local jobs. Health care accounts for 8 percent of the local economy and 13 percent of jobs. Trade generates nearly 14 percent of the region's economic output and is closely tied to jobs in manufacturing, which account for more than 10 percent of local employment, according to federal labor and economic data. Trade will be especially closely-watched since Trump promised tougher negotiations with other countries and blamed "bad deals," such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, for costing U.S. middle-class manufacturing jobs. Trump singled out Mexico and China for criticism of trade terms – Ohio's No. 2 and No. 3 trading partners that account for nearly 20 percent of $51 billion worth of exports in 2015, according to the Ohio Development Services Agency. "The trade issue is my biggest worry because with protectionism comes a whole series of dominos of repercussions," said Julie Heath, executive director of the University of Cincinnati Economics Center. "Consumers are right away looking at higher prices on imported goods. If we decrease our trade with the rest of the world, we are at risk of a global recession." In contrast with the rest of Ohio, Cincinnati's manufacturing employment has grown 23 percent or by nearly 200,000 jobs since NAFTA took effect in 1994. The entire sector employs about 1.1 million, federal data shows. Cincinnati is Ohio's capital for exports: producing $24.1 billion worth of goods, nearly half of Ohio goods sent overseas. "Trade's a challenge because we're really not sure how much of what he said will be policy and how much was just campaign rhetoric," said Jason Jackman, president and chief investment officer of Johnson Investment Counsel in Monfort Heights. Jackman said if Trump follows through with threats to slap tariffs on goods from China or other countries, they will likely retaliate and a trade war will result. Ultimately, all countries involved will sell fewer goods overseas and their economies will suffer. While Trump bemoaned the country's $19 trillion debt, he's also talked up tax cuts and infrastructure and military spending. Jackman said that bond yields on Wednesday rose, indicating interest rates would rise. That signals the market believes the nation's debt would ultimately increase, which could weigh down on the economy. "The markets are concerned about increased deficit spending," Jackman said. Heath said repealing and replacing Obamacare risked higher cost for states if millions of residents become uninsured again. Fallout in financial markets Though U.S. stock futures threatened to plummet overnight over Donald Trump's surprise victory, markets declined only modestly after opening on Wednesday morning. Dow Jones futures dropped as much as 800 points overnight, pointing to potential losses not seen since the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But by the market close, all the major indices showed gains. The Dow closed up 1.4 percent, the S&P role 1.1 percent, the Nasdaq finished the day up 1.1 percent and the Russell 3000 finished up 3.1 percent. Buy Photo  (Photo: Enquirer file) AK Steel and Fifth Third saw shares jump Wednesday morning as investors bet a Trump administration would take a harder line against steel dumping and relax some regulations that big banks face. AK Steel shares surged nearly 14 percent and Fifth Third jumped 6 percent. Shares of Ashland and Convergys stock were pummeled by more than 5 percent each on poor quarterly performance results. Procter & Gamble stock dropped 1.8 percent on trade concerns. Jeffries analyst Seth Rosenfeld predicted the steel industry would be a unique beneficiary of a more "protectionist" Trump administration. "Falling imports will improve domestic pricing power," Rosenfeld said, adding steel companies, such as AK Steel "should benefit from rising protectionist trade policy." Evercore analyst Glenn Schorr wrote in a note to investors that revising Dodd-Frank financial regulations might be "wishful thinking," but noted a Trump might be a more "friendly" rule-enforcer and his pro-growth philosophy could help the financial sector. "Pro-growth, lower taxes, fiscal stimulus-infrastructure agenda are good for lenders," Schorr wrote, adding that a Federal Reserve decision to raise interest rates was "still in play" and would be "good for banks." 6 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2ffQIz7 TOP VIDEOS Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 Use-of-force expert: 'The actions of Ray Tensing were justified' 0:50 Which stores are opening, closing Thanksgiving Day 0:34 \u0022I can't wait to see Tensing on the stand\u0022 0:55 Cincinnati Police Criminalist: Tensing 'seemed nervous or afraid' 2:59 Crime lab: No evidence on Tensing’s boots that he was dragged 4:07 Alternate juror in Ray Tensing trial has been dismissed 1:24 Born in Cincinnati, celebrated around the world: An anthem that unites us 3:39 Inside Prep Sports 360: Colerain Football prepares for playoffs 5:05 JP Macura looks ahead to the season 2:24

The company's stock fell as much as 15.6 percent to $18.48 on Wednesday, a day after the U.S election, its lowest level since January last year. On a call with analysts, executives attributed the continuing sales weakness to distractions caused by the integration of Procter & Gamble Co's specialty beauty business, which Coty acquired for $12.5 billion. "People are not necessarily fully focused on the business ... they are in transition ... helping out on the integration of the business so those have caused distractions and caused us to lose momentum in the business," Coty Chairman Bart Becht said on the call. The company also said that challenges in the consumer beauty business and the previously-announced sale of 6-8 percent of its product portfolio would hurt second-quarter sales. Becht said the results of the recently concluded U.S. presidential election do not affect the company's plans. SALES LOSE SHINE Fragrance sales fell 9 percent on a like-for-like basis, while color cosmetics fell 6 percent in the first quarter ended Sept. 30. These two segments are its biggest contributors to revenue. "This period of integration for Coty has been met with less than stellar underlying performance and lack of clarity has created anxiety in the stock," Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink said in a note. Coty has inked multiple deals to transform itself into a global beauty products giant, as it reduces its dependence on its struggling fragrance business. After buying P&G's specialty beauty business, the company acquired ghd, a high-end hairstyling appliance brand, from private equity firm Lion Capital LLP for about $522 million. Coty posted no profit during the first quarter ended Sept. 30. In the year-earlier quarter, the company reported a net income of $125.7 million, or 34 cents per share. Net revenue fell to $1.08 billion from $1.11 billion. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $1.14 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of Coty, which owns cosmetics brands like COVERGIRL and Rimmel, were down 13.2 percent in early trading. The stock has fallen as much as 23 percent in the last 12 months.

ALSO READ Market slightly lower in early trade Market hovers in red Market extends losses on negative European cues Market recovers from the day's low Side counters tumble Key benchmark indices continued trading with sharp losses in early afternoon trade. At 12:16 IST, the barometer index, the S&P BSE Sensex, was down 918.81 points or 3.33% at 26,672.33. The Nifty 50 index was down 297.40 points or 3.48% at 8,246.15. The Nifty held above the psychologically important 8,000 mark. The Sensex was trading below the psychologically important 27,000 mark. It had slipped below the 26,000 level at the onset of trading session. Selling was triggered by the Union government's surprise move to withdraw currency notes with a denomination of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500, effective from Tuesday, 8 November 2016, midnight, in an attempt to crack down on black money. Meanwhile, global financial markets sold off as the results of the US election were being called, with Asian stocks and US futures tumbling as Donald Trump pulled ahead in the race for presidency. The United States presidential elections of 2016 were held yesterday, 8 November 2016. The broad market depicted weakness. There were more than 11 losers against every gainer on BSE. 2,321 shares fell and 202 shares rose. A total of 73 shares were unchanged. The BSE Mid-Cap index was currently down 5.02%. The BSE Small-Cap index was currently down 5.91%. The decline in both these indices was higher than the Sensex's decline in percentage terms. In overseas stock markets, Asian stocks slumped in volatile trading as investors await the outcome of the US presidential election, with early results showing Donald Trump capturing several states. In US, stocks finished in positive territory for a second straight day on Tuesday, 8 November 2016, as gains in the consumer goods, utilities and telecoms sectors led shares higher. Trading in US index futures indicated that the Dow Jones Industrial Average could slump 641 points at the opening bell today, 9 November 2016, as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump pulled ahead of Democrat Hillary Clinton in electoral votes. As on 12:15 IST, Hillary Clinton currently has 215 votes, and Donald Trump has 264. Candidates need at least 270 electoral votes to win. Investors around the world are closely watching how the vote tally plays out in America, where Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump vie for the White House. Clinton is viewed more favorably by Wall Street, as she is a well-known political entity who represents the status quo. In contrast, Trump is viewed more warily by investors due to his unpredictable behavior and his negative views on free trade. Investors fear a Trump victory could cause global economic and trade turmoil and years of policy unpredictability, discouraging the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates in December as long expected. Back home, FMCG shares tumbled on concerns that the government's crackdown on black money could hit retail consumption in the near term. Tata Global Beverages (down 8.29%), Marico (down 5.1%), Jyothy Laboratories (down 4.2%), Britannia Industries (down 3.66%), Godrej Consumer Products (down 3.3%), Colgate Palmolive (India) (down 3.09%), Hindustan Unilever (down 2.87%), Dabur India (down 2.54%), Nestle India (down 1.91%), Bajaj Corp (down 1.76%), Procter & Gamble Hygiene & Health Care (down 1.44%) and GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare (down 0.54%), edged lower. Cement shares edged lower. UltraTech Cement (down 6.54%), Ambuja Cements (down 6%) and ACC (down 4.99%), edged lower. Grasim Industries was down 2.81%. Grasim has exposure to cement sector through its holding in UltraTech Cement. Hindalco Industries skidded 6.50% on equity dilution concerns after the company announced that board of directors will consider raising of funds by issue of equity related instruments. Hindalco Industries announced during market hours today, 9 November 2016, that a meeting of the board of directors of the company is scheduled on 12 November 2016 to consider among other items, approval of raising of funds by issue of equity shares, global depository receipts/American depository receipts/, foreign currency convertible bonds/, fully convertible debentures/partly convertible debentures/ preference shares convertible into equity shares, and/or any other financial instruments convertible into equity shares (including warrants, or otherwise, in registered or bearer form) and/or any security convertible into equity shares, combination of any of the aforementioned securities by way of one or more public and/or private offerings, qualified institutions placement and/or on preferential allotment basis or any combination thereof or any other method as may be permitted under applicable law, subject to such approvals as may be required. On the macro front, in a historical move that will add record strength in the fight against corruption, black money, money laundering, terrorism and financing of terrorists as well as counterfeit notes, the Government of India decided that the five hundred and one thousand rupee notes will no longer be legal tender from midnight of 8 November 2016. The Government accepted the recommendations of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to issue two thousand rupee notes and new notes of five hundred rupees will also be placed in circulation. Notes of one hundred, fifty, twenty, ten, five, two and one rupee will remain legal tender and will remain unaffected by the decision. The Prime Minister said the steps taken by the Government would strengthen the hands of the common citizens in the fight against corruption, black money and counterfeit notes. Persons holding old notes of five hundred or one thousand rupees can deposit these notes in bank or post offices from 10 November 2016 onwards till 30 December 2016, the Prime Minister announced yesterday, 8 November 2016, evening.

Credit Bill Rinehart / WVXU Democrat Aftab Pureval did something Tuesday night that seemed impossible for the past few generations of Democrats in Hamilton County – he defeated a Winkler in an election. In this case, it was Tracy Winkler, the Hamilton County clerk of courts. Pureval – a first-time candidate – had 52 percent of the vote to Winkler's 48 percent. "We had  a plan; we stuck to the plan and we ran a grassroots campaign,'' Pureval told WVXU. "In 2016, qualifications and idea won out."  It helped that he outspent his opponent by about five-to-one, but he did it too with sweat and shoe leather. The fact that he had an uncommon, hard-to-pronounce name was a concern for the 34-year-old O'Bryonville resident, when he was mulling over the possibility of running for office in Hamilton County this year, his fellow Democrats say. His name is a source of pride for Pureval. It was given to him by a father from India and a mother who was a Tibetan refugee who fled the Chinese communists. His parents came to this country and decided to settle in, of all places, Beavercreek, Ohio. He became student body president at The Ohio State University (often a door that, once opened, can lead to a career in politics), earned a law degree at the University of Cincinnati, worked for a time with a high-powered law firm in Washington, D.C. , where he did pro bono work representing battered women; and returned to Cincinnati to serve a special assistant U.S. attorney. These days, he is working for Procter & Gamble as the attorney for a billion-dollar brand. Winkler is a potent name in Hamilton County politics, particularly among the throngs of Republican voters in the West Side suburbs. As far as making people familiar with his name, he used a light-hearted approach, doing campaign TV ads with a duck puppet that would periodically squawk "Aftab" – sort of like the Aflac duck in the popular TV ads. Tracy Winkler is part of a passel of Winklers who are serving or have served in elective office – her husband Ralph "Ted" Winkler is the county probate judge; her father-in-law, Ralph Winkler, is retired after serving decades as a judge; her brother-in-law, Robert Winkler, is a common pleas court judge; and her late mother-in-law, Cheryl Winkler, was a Green Township trustee and a state representative. The newspaper City Beat acquired e-mails Winkler's then-chief deputy bailiff, Donald Robinson Jr., sent to employees of the clerk's office telling them to contact the agency's human resources  director if they were willing to distribute campaign yard signs, wear Winkler T-shirts and march in a parade with other Winkler supporters. "There are plenty of events this weekend to get out and support our Keep Tracy Winkler Clerk of Courts campaign,'' Robinson wrote in one of the e-mails City Beat acquired. "As always, post your pictures to all social media." Winkler reprimanded Robinson for the e-mails, which were sent through personal e-mail accounts but during work hours. And she transferred him to a new job, safety and security manager/director, at the same salary he made as chief deputy bailiff for municipal court.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 7:10 AM, November 11, 2016 Updated: 3:30 PM, November 11, 2016 WASHINGTON - Donald Trump's White House victory moves Apple <AAPL.O>, Pfizer <PFE.N>, Microsoft <MSFT.O> and other big U.S. corporations much closer than they have been in years to winning a big tax break on $2.6 trillion in foreign profits. Tax reform is shaping up as among the most fruitful areas for cooperation between Trump and his fellow Republicans, who held control in Tuesday's elections of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Trump and congressional Republicans have separate, but similar, tax reform plans. Both would slash tax rates on businesses, simplify and cut individual taxes, and let companies bring overseas profits into the country at a low tax rate, raising prospects for a sweeping deal on taxes. Bipartisan support for corporate tax reform has been growing as multinational companies have amassed tax-deferred profits abroad and brought continuous lobbying pressure over a decade for a tax break on them. "On tax policy, he's basically adopted the House blueprint as his approach," said Rohit Kumar, co-leader of the tax policy services practice at Big Four accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers [PWC.UL]. "There's a better chance that something happens next year than there has been at any point in the last several years." At the heart of the issue is a law that lets U.S. companies hold foreign profits overseas without paying U.S. corporate tax on them, unless and until those profits are brought into the United States, which is known as repatriation. Corporations have $2.6 trillion stashed abroad under this law. That money could be repatriated any time, but businesses choose not to because it would incur the 35 percent statutory corporate income tax. Trump and House Republicans, including Speaker Paul Ryan, would still need to agree on how to pay for lower corporate tax rates and on whether U.S.-based multinationals should pay U.S. taxes on future foreign profits. Trump and congressional Republicans would also need support for tax reform from Democrats if they intend to present the package as a benefit for the country as a whole, analysts say. Such proposals have stumbled before on Democrats' objections that they are corporate give-away, and on Republicans' insistence that they be paired with a cut in the corporate income tax rate. Democrats could still block legislation they dislike from reaching the floor of the Senate, which requires a super majority of 60 votes to advance a measure, but there are procedural maneuvers Republicans could use to bypass them. The one-time surge in revenue that would result from repatriation could help fund another cornerstone of Trump's campaign platform -- a pledge to boost the economy through big investments in U.S. highways, roads, bridges, airports and seaports. Infrastructure spending was not a campaign priority for congressional Republicans. But a new job-creating program could appeal to Democrats and be valuable to lawmakers in the 2018 mid-term elections. The four companies with the largest profits held overseas are: Apple Inc ($200 billion), Pfizer Inc ($194 billion), Microsoft Corp ($108 billion) and General Electric Co <GE.N> ($104 billion), according to March estimates by Citizens for Tax Justice, a corporate income tax watchdog group in Washington. (Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2eBx2BO). The European Commission in August hit Apple with a 13 billion euro ($14.3 billion) bill for back taxes, fanning concerns among other U.S. multinationals and U.S. officials that their untaxed foreign revenues could be vulnerable to further European penalties. Apple CEO Tim Cook told an interviewer in September that he expects to repatriate billions of dollars in global profits to the United States in 2017 but did not say how. He said in another interview that the company would not bring money back unless there was "a fair rate" and said he was optimistic that tax reform would occur next year. BUSINESS SUPPORT The House tax plan, which Ryan and other leading Republicans promoted throughout the campaign, would lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, force multinationals to repatriate existing foreign earnings and adopt a "territorial" system that would largely end taxation of U.S. companies' foreign income. Trump is calling for a steeper rate cut to 15 percent, and he has proposed a 10 percent tax rate for repatriated overseas profits held in cash, payable over a decade. Some are optimistic that those differences can be overcome. "In the end, there are no differences that can't be solved on the tax issue," said Republican Representative Tom Cole. The House Republican plan has had significant support from business. Kumar's PwC advises the Alliance for Competitive Taxation, which lobbies on tax reform for over 40 companies ranging from Alcoa Inc <AA.N> and Cisco Systems Inc <CSCO.O> to Alphabet's Google Inc <GOOGL.O>, Procter & Gamble Co <PG.N> and Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N>. "We know what we want," said Dorothy Coleman, a tax policy expert at the National Association of Manufacturers, referring to a lower corporate tax rate, adopting a "modern, competitive" territorial system, and a permanent R&D credit among other wishes. The House's corporate tax plan would cut revenues by more than $890 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The same research group says Trump's corporate plan would reduce revenues by $2.6 trillion. Trump and Republicans in Congress view tax reform as a way to jump-start economic growth and job creation. Business lobbyists say that higher tax revenues from a growing economy would address much of the House plan's shortfall. Trump advisers say revenue erosion posed by the president-elect's plan would be overcome by growth and policy initiatives including a more aggressive approach to trade.

Awards were presented October 27, 2016 at the PPC 2016 Fall Meeting and Leadership Conference in San Antonio, TX. The competition, sponsored by the Paperboard Packaging Council (PPC) and judged by a jury of packaging professionals, industry experts, and professors, is a celebration of the industry and its creative potential. It is also an affirmation of paperboard as the clear and intelligent choice for packaging in today's eco-conscious world. Diamond won an Excellence Award for Elizabeth Arden's John Varvatos Artisan Blu folding carton. The carton was converted utilizing Clearwater Paper Candesce® SBS paperboard and offset printed with four color process and blue inks, in-line with UV matte, and UV gloss spot coating. The multi-level embossed "water" pattern on the front, side, and rear panels, was tightly registered to the printing and coatings, contributing to the natural aesthetic of the carton. The interplay between the coatings and multi-level embossing create a shimmering effect, inspired by Mediterranean beaches. The embossed graphic on the rear panel represents the flask-like fragrance bottle housed in handwoven rattan. Diamond won an Excellence Award for L'Oreal USA's Matrix Oil Wonders promotional packaging. The carton was converted utilizing KapStone Kraftpak® high-yield, low density paperboard and printed with UV flexo white, opaque white, four color process, and dense black inks, in-line with UV varnish. Printed opaque white dots provide a perfect counterpoint to the brilliant gold foil stamped dots, creating dimension and visual interest. Gold foil surrounds the die cut windows, framing the hair care products within and drawing attention to the free product sample inside. Kraftpak's natural aesthetic embodies the essence of ancient world rituals, while the gold metallic flourishes infuses the visual with a rich, exotic quality. Diamond won an Excellence Award for its 2016 calendar, which marks the 25th anniversary of a long-standing company tradition. The grandfather clock theme, with its inner mechanisms perfectly balanced, represents the collaborative and precise nature of Diamond's work. The calendar was converted utilizing Clearwater Paper Candesce® SBS paperboard and offset printed with four color process inks, UV matte coating, and UV gloss spot coating. The dimensional header features a multi-level embossed and debossed woodgrain pattern, and a striking clock face insert enhanced with UV gloss spot coating, cold foil, and multi-level embossing, creating a dramatic sense of texture and depth. It also incorporates an opening APET rigid window panel and foil embossed chimes that artfully simulate a real grandfather clock. The middle backers also feature a multi-level embossed woodgrain pattern, and three unique sets of foil embossed gears enhanced with UV gloss spot coating. Metal Magic provided all of the embossing dies. The tightly-registered foil accents, which lend authenticity to the piece, were achieved using state-of-the-art, in-line cold foiling technology. They also showcase the type of decorative effects that can cost-effectively elevate customers' brands.
