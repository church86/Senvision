Driven by on-demand labour platforms and online work management solutions, digital technology is giving rise to talent marketplaces that are sweeping aside the old hierarchical management structures. Becoming an on-demand enterprise is key to being able to deliver rapid innovation and organisational change to truly transform into digital businesses for the twenty-first century. Read More Insider to host inaugural SME Conference In this talent marketplace, businesses can bring together the skills they need into ad hoc teams, to accomplish specific goals, then release them back into the talent pool to tackle another challenge. That may not appear daunting to a new or start-up company. WordPress parent company Automattic has 450 staff spanning 45 different countries and business is done based on project teams ranging from two to 12 workers. But new technology companies aren’t the only ones reinventing the traditional approach to the workforce. Procter & Gamble, established some 180 years ago, is experimenting with on-demand talent marketplaces as a means to augment its own workforce, using Upwork Enterprise. So far, products from this pilot programme were delivered faster and at a lower cost than with conventional methods 60 per cent of the time. Labour platforms like Upwork allow for teams of internal employees and freelancers with the right skills to be quickly assembled to complete projects and then dispersed when the job is done. It is a much needed talent revolution when you consider that 73 per cent of executives questioned in a recent Accenture survey reported that corporate bureaucracies are stifling productivity and innovation. The companies that are flourishing are those that are leveraging technology solutions that address the talent problem: efficiently matching the supply and demand for people and skills in a highly personalised way. In a similar vein, large companies like MasterCard, Airbus and World Bank have used Gigster’s AI-driven platform for their high end talent of software developers and project managers. Companies can spin up new agile design and development programmes in just weeks, if not days, compared to the traditional model that takes months of planning, budgeting, sourcing and launching. Companies that use online work management solutions are able to leverage both internal and external workers, fill a talent gap, jump start new projects and respond to market changes. Read More Build-up to the Scottish Accountancy & Finance Awards: Finalists in Restructuring Team of the Year The supply of available, skilled freelance workers is already steady and growing, making on-demand labour not just possible but also ideal to quickly augment a company’s workforce. Instead of a traditional structure where individuals are hired for a single position and engaged in fixed business functions, a marketplace-like approach will support people being dynamically teamed together on-demand from project to project, based on skills, knowledge and staffing needs. But there are consequences. Companies are also fundamentally rewriting the social contract – reshaping the view on the relationships and responsibilities that employers, government and society have with their workers. Who provides worker training for non-traditional employees? Who pays for benefits if someone is a fluid worker, moving between different companies? If freelance workers are between assignments are they unemployed? At Accenture, we are exploring the future of engaging on-demand workers who take on project-based work while earning credits towards training and benefits. It is going to be crucial that frameworks are created that provide the flexibility to scale the current and emerging worker relationships, while optimising the related mix of compensation, benefits, training and community engagement. The nature of work and social contracts are in flux in economies around the world. What is imperative is that we stop thinking about people working for companies and start making companies work for people. Already we are seeing a ‘liquid workforce’. This is where in response to constant disruption and fast-shifting business goals, forward-thinking enterprises are reimagining their workforce and no one person spends their entire careers doing the same job, suing the same skills. Providing constant training that gives employees the skills they need to adapt and thrive and organising them into teams around projects, is becoming a competitive advantage. Accenture estimates that as we look five years ahead is that in addition presumptive judgements around full-time employment and freelancers is likely to flip completely. Compared to traditional full-time employment, talent marketplaces will provide workers with improved earning opportunities, more rewarding work, secure benefits and respected credentials. In response, the business structures of the dominant companies will be based on small cores and powerful ecosystems, while the on-demand labour platforms will be the primary drivers of economic growth in both the developed and emerging economies worldwide.

That’s how you survive.” – Cecilio Pedro It all started with a young boy’s passion and willpower to create change in the community. Cecilio Kwok Pedro, the founder and president of Lamoiyan Corp., did not build his empire overnight. He endured failures and disappointments along the way that made him the person he is today. Blossoming entrepreneurial mindset When he was still studying, he used to sell ball pens to his classmates. Surprisingly, the pens ran out fast, but most if not all were purchased in credit. At this stage of his life, we can already see an entrepreneurial mindset waiting to blossom. The journey continued right after college; he opened a hardware store in Alonzo, Manila. The area is known as the hub for hardware stores and a new entrant will have difficulty in penetrating the market arena. The competition was so stiff that he ended up closing his business.  In the mid 1970s, he once again ventured in a new investment. This time he opened Aluminum Container Inc. The company was one the suppliers of the aluminum toothpaste packaging to large fast moving consumer goods companies such as Procter and Gamble, Unilever and Colgate-Palmolive. During that time, aluminum was the most trusted raw material for that item. The performance of the business was driving smoothly until his clients opted to change the material they used from aluminum to plastic. It was an end of an era that forced suppliers to eventually close their company. This hiccup did not allow Cecilio Pedro to lose hope; in fact, he once again took the risk. This decision led to the birth of one of the largest Filipino-owned fast moving consumer goods companies, known as Lamoiyan Corp., maker of Hapee toothpase. Leading by example True to its tagline of “Making the difference for the glory of God,” Cecilio Pedro is a strong believer of social responsibility. He is not only focused on generating profit, but his push is also to contribute to the environment and community. I think they are the first corporation who employs people with hearing disability. With this gesture, hope was restored to these hearing-impaired employees.  The reality is people with disability are given unequal opportunities in the society, which in effect, destroy their moral and self-importance. As much as possible, he really wants to help by leading by example. His main intention is to encourage other businessmen to also be socially active in helping the community. Making the dream a reality The entry and involvement of deaf people in the daily operations was not easy for the company. A lot of adjustments were made in order to achieve a peaceful and productive working environment. The management and its employees were also taught sign languages in order to communicate with them. I admire how he integrated Corporate Social Responsibility to the company’s thrusts. If you come to think of it, hiring someone with an impairment may be a big challenge. But he followed his heart and made his dream of making a difference a reality. As future Lasallian business leaders, this is something that we can emulate from Lamoiyan’s founder so we can be that change in our own communities. The author is an MBA student at the Ramon V. del Rosario College of Business. This essay is part of a journal he kept in fulfillment of the requirements of the course, Lasallian Business Leadership with Corporate Social Responsibility and Ethics.  Visit his blog at https://thegreenchatterbox.wordpress.com/.

Baker / Published: May 28, 2017 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     ROBERT BAKER / STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Horse and buggy rides added to the Christmas spirit last December in downtown Tunkhannock. On the eve of a new historical walking tour through Tunkhannock unveiled last summer, Mayor Norm Ball responded to a question about all the good things that seemed to be happening to Tunkhannock. “I wish I could take credit for it all, but the truth of the matter is that we have great groups of volunteers who know how to act when they see a need,” he said. About 20 years ago, tractor-trailer rigs carrying products from the mammoth Procter & Gamble plant 5 miles away in Washington Twp. clogged Tunkhannock’s main thoroughfares —Tioga and Bridge streets — to the point that normal business traffic was reduced to a crawl, taking a half hour to move just a couple of miles. Enter Joe DeMarco, chairman of the borough’s bypass committee, who once described his role in making the road a reality as being “a burr under people’s saddles.” The $26.5 million Tunkhannock Bypass was dedicated on Nov. 7, 2001. Almost overnight, the downtown could breathe again, and the public warmed to the idea of a business district with a “real” future. A year later, local resident Hildy Morgan spearheaded the notion of taking a rundown theater there closed since the 1980s and resurrecting it. In 2011, Morgan passed the mantle of caring for what by that time had become a four-theater Wyoming County Cultural Center to Erica Rogler and Margie Young, and it has become a magnet for economic development in town. “No, they weren’t trying to make money, but people saw the Dietrich (theater) as something positive that others wished to build on,” said Beth Bevan, who now serves as president of the Tunkhannock Business and Professional Association. “On a personal level, I also believe it provides a great opportunity for old-fashioned dating, and we need that in our lives.” TBPA Executive Director Nancy Parlo noted that people from Clarks Summit and Dallas — as well as Wilkes-Barre and Scranton — were telling her they’d rather go to a movie in Tunkhannock than head to one of the regional multiplexes, and besides, they could eat in one of the local restaurants and visit the town’s quaint shops before a movie. While the Dietrich was coming into its own, Wyoming County Commissioner and businesswoman Judy Kraft Mead spearheaded a streetscape development with grant money that not only improved the sidewalks in the business district but added 87 Victorian-style lampposts to give it an antique ambiance. Almost simultaneously, a new library and hose company headquarters moved into more modern spaces. Tunkhannock’s future began to look rosy in 2006 when the Marcellus gas was identified as being beneath the local citizens’ feet and it seemed cost-effective to bring it up by a process known as fracking. On the last weekend of September 2009, Wyoming County Recorder of Deeds Dennis Montross estimated that roughly $230 million in lease money changed hands between Chesapeake Energy and Wyoming County landowners. With money in their pockets, a boom was forecasted locally, and almost overnight two hotels — the Hampton Inn on the east end of town, and the Comfort Inn just across the river from Tunkhannock — had a groundbreaking. And almost simultaneously, the Prince Hotel, which had stood on the corner of Tioga and Bridge streets for 167 years, was sold, with buyer Samir “Sunny” Mehta promising to upgrade the landmark by pumping into it what some claim was close to $1 million. Then two things happened. The price of gas on the world market dropped precipitously, and Tunkhannock itself was ravaged by a flood in 2011 that saw water from the Susquehanna River get to its highest flood stage ever. That the area economy — and particularly the gas companies — had money in their pockets meant that cleanup efforts were expedited in ways that other river towns in the Wyoming Valley were not so fortunate to see. As the gas price has improved, drilling activity has returned to the region, but not with anything like the initial burst. The downtown district is feeling some pain, with some obvious storefront vacancies on Tioga Street as well as the closure of Seasons Restaurant, and announcements in the past 12 months that both the Prince Hotel and Brick’s Grocery Market are looking for buyers. It’s not cause for alarm, said Donna LaBar, who has worked as a real estate agent in Tunkhannock for 32 years and is a broker for Century 21 Sherlock Homes Inc. “I’ve seen cycles like this come and go,” LaBar said. Sometimes businesses have owners who experience life changes — such as those who retire — but have no one to take over the operation. “I don’t see it as negative,” she said. “These businesses have grown; they need to offer more parking and more services and things will improve.” Contact the writer: bbaker@wcexaminer.com We welcome user discussion on our site, under the following guidelines: To comment you must first create a profile and sign-in with a verified DISQUS account or social network ID.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 29 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman 1-Decanol Market : Global Industry Analysis,Trends and Forecast 2024 A new research report by Transparency Market Research offers a comprehensive evaluation of the global 1-Decanol Market. The study, titled “1-Decanol Market – Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2016 – 2024”, is available for sale on the firm’s website. The molecular formula of 1-decanol is C10H22O. 1-Decanol is a derivative of oil or natural fat. It is prepared by hydrogenation reaction of decanoic acid. The IUPAC name of 1-Decanol is Dec-1-ol. It has an aromatic odor, density of 0.8297 g/cm3 and boiling point 232.90C. 1-Decanol belongs to a group of long chain aliphatic alcohols within a carbon chain length of C6-24. It possesses solubilizing or emulsifying properties, and can be used as anti-spalling agent in concrete. It is an excellent lubricating agent. 1-Decanol is also used as antifoam and raw material for natural based wetting agents. It is a colorless liquid substance, which is inflammable. Browse Market Research Report @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/1-decanol-market.html 1-Decanol is readily biodegradable and therefore degrades in the environment. The biodegradability of 1-Decanol is expected to boost its usage in personal care and polymer processing applications. However, it is acutely toxic and therefore is harmful for aquatic life. When accumulated in large quantities, it may cause death of aquatic organisms. It causes mild skin irritation when exposed in large quantities to skin. 1-Decanol is also used in cleaning agents and coatings; however, the concentration of 1-decanol is generally low in cleaning agents. The other names of 1- Decanol are Decyl Alcohol; n-Decanol; primary Decyl Alcohol; Decylic Alcohol; n- Decyl Alcohol; Capric Alcohol; and Alcohol C-10. The market for 1-Decanol can be segmented based on end-use applications into plasticizers, lubricants, surfactants, cleaning agents, personal care, and pharmaceutical. It is used as penetration enhancer in transdermal drug delivery in the pharmaceutical industry because of its ability to permeate the skin. It is used as aluminum rolling lubricants, lubricant oil additives, and plastic lubricants in the lubricants industry. 1-Decanol is extensively used in lotions, creams, and conditioners in the personal care industry. In terms of region, the 1-Decanol market can be segregated into Asia Pacific, North America, Latin America, Middle East & Africa, and Europe. The global market for 1-Decanol is expected to expand. Asia Pacific is anticipated to be the dominant region due to the high demand for personal care products. China and India are likely to be the prominent consumers of 1-Decanol in Asia Pacific due to presence of established end-user industries in these countries. Growth in the polymer processing industry in Asia Pacific and North America is also estimated to propel the demand for 1-Decanol. The 1-Decanol market in North America and Europe is expected to expand, led by the increase in demand for beauty products in these regions. Key players operating in the 1-Decanol market are P&G Chemicals, Sasol, BASF SE, Thai Fatty Alcohol, Kao, Muslim Mas, and Emery Oleochemicals. Emery Oleochemicals sells products under the brand name EMERCOL, which is a group of natural based fatty alcohols. It is used for various purposes in skin care, sun screens, and toiletries applications. BASF SE provides 1-Decanol, which is nontoxic, non-carcinogenic and is used in various end user applications such as personal care, cleaning agents, and polymer processing. Companies are adopting aggressive marketing tactics and merger and acquisition strategies to expand their market share. They are also shifting their production facilities to emerging economies in Asia Pacific and Latin America due to the easy availability of land, cheap labor, and governmental subsidies in these regions.

Geoff Gurevich on May 29, 2017 at 11:00 am More Let’s talk about your creative agency — the team of marketing gurus who take all the messy, disjointed advantages about your company that you provide them with and turn it all into a polished campaign. They did a SWOT analysis, the pitch is polished, and you spent exorbitant amounts of your marketing budget to get their campaign in front of your market. Then, the seemingly impossible happens: crickets. Was it the creative itself or something else? Let’s explore the possibilities. The creative may not be the issue One of the biggest mistakes your agency is probably making is believing you. While you prefer to think that your agency is in the business of getting you great results, that’s actually their secondary goal. Their first goal is keeping the agency in business — a goal which requires making clients like you happy. It’s the reason you’re assigned an account manager whose only job is to refine how the rest of the team’s jargon is conveyed to you, their client. This relationship creates a conflict of interest for your business. They listen to your concerns and provide elegant solutions — but in many cases, these concerns are based on gut feelings rather than hard data or research to identify the real issues your company is struggling with. Many times, upper management is too close to the business to understand the way the market views their company (their positioning). Their anecdotal insight is valuable, but researching the needs of your company’s target market is often more critical to success. Creative agencies that typically work with large brands are in the habit of testing concepts with focus groups before releasing final work to the masses. Yet, the majority of agencies don’t place enough importance on the research that would land them on the right trajectory to begin with. There are certainly exceptions. There are quite a few creative agencies that are diligent in this area, but the majority either glaze over this process or fail to connect their concepts to the findings. Can an agency be creative and analytical? Today’s creative agencies are spending less time pitching themselves as the boutique or traditional advertising experts they started as, instead adopting a “full-service” approach. The problem lies in the fact that most agencies do not excel in all areas of marketing, and many are adopting digital because they have to. All too often, services that are outside of the agency’s core competency are outsourced and white-labeled without the client ever knowing. So, the creative agency you just hired to run your entire marketing portfolio is likely outsourcing management of the distribution channels that give their content the runway to succeed. The result is an inherent disconnect to what your account manager can communicate back to you, with intelligence, regarding the inner-workings of your campaigns. If your pay-per-click advertising is weakly executed or your SEO efforts are minimal or misguided, you may go months or years without knowing that these factors are killing your success, not the creative itself. Your results now heavily rely on their background “partner,” who you likely did not take the same care to vet, or worse yet, are not even aware of. But you wanted to hire a single point of accountability Some of the largest organizations in existence (Sears, Procter & Gamble, Kraft) still prefer to maintain a healthy mix of true boutique agencies to handle their areas of expertise separately. One agency may be responsible for all digital creative production, while another agency places and manages the media. For example, a dedicated digital marketing agency is probably better suited to build, manage and optimize paid search or display campaigns than a traditional marketing agency that offers digital services. The same is true of a digital agency offering printing services or traditional media placement. In most cases, it just makes sense to utilize firms in the areas that they are truly experts. Instead of blindly taking on an entire marketing portfolio management scope with an agency that presented well in one area, take the time to discuss each channel in-depth and understand their strategy. What methodology will they use to conduct research, create concepts, place media and assess results? Try to gain an understanding of what your prospective agency handles internally versus what they outsource. If they outsource or partner with another agency, chat with them directly and find out who your point of contact will be throughout the engagement. After having these discussions, you’ll be in a stronger position to decide whether the agency you are considering can handle it all, or whether they’re stretching their capabilities on your campaign.
