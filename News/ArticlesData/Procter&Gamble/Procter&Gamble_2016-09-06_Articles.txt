Leo Burnett and Citizen Relations launched a new spot for Mr. Clean starring actor Kellan Lutz of the Twilight series and The Legend of Hercules. Don’t worry, we had to Google him too. The spot, which arrives on the heels of Leo Burnett reviving the Mr. Clean jingle for the brand, features Lutz in a mock audition for the Mr. Clean role. A casting director comments that it’s a big departure from “the whole teen hearthrob thing” and he explains that he’s been looking for something different. His qualifications for the role? He washes his car after every use, polishes his Teen Choice Awards every single day and has “never had a dirty thought” in his entire life. After initially struggling to adapt to the new character, he impresses the casting director…until she finds out something “too dirty for Mr. Clean.” After the spot’s attempts at meta humor fall flat, it ends with Lutz inviting viewers to try out for the role themselves, directing them to TheNextMrClean.com. In addition to the full-length version online, which stretches the premise well past its breaking point, there’s also a 60-second broadcast version. “This is the second in our series of efforts to go back to our roots,” Kevin Wenzel, associate brand director for Procter and Gamble North America, explained to Adweek. “The first was the new modern version of our jingle television spot, which we launched July 1. It was a well-known jingle that was used to launch the brand. We used it for decades, and it was brought into a more modern context.”  “We will still have our iconic Mr. Clean, but this will be a chance to let a consumer have a little bit of fun and let us have a little bit of fun as well,” Wenzel clarified. “That next Mr. Clean will be helping us generate content, including appearing in a calendar which we’ll be showing online.” The brand will be poring over audition tapes submitted online from today through October 7, as well as hosting a pair of casting sessions in New York and Los Angles, before announcing the contest’s $20,000 winner in mid-October. We know someone who would be perfect for the role. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Andrés Cardenal (TMFacardenal) Sep 7, 2016 at 9:47AM Image source: Getty Images. Dividend aristocrats are a select group of high-quality dividend stocks. Among other requirements, a company must have increased its dividends for 25 consecutive years or more to be considered a dividend aristocrat. Past performance is no guarantee of future results, but a solid track record of dividend payments can say a lot about the health of a business. On the other hand, many dividend aristocrats have been delivering lackluster dividend growth lately. This includes widely popular dividend stocks such as Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), AT&T (NYSE:T), and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), which are raising their dividends at anemic rates.  The retail giant is asleep On Feb. 18, Wal-Mart announced its most recent dividend increase, raising dividends by $0.01 per share, from $0.49 to $0.50 quarterly. This was the third consecutive year in which Wal-Mart increased payments by only $0.01, so lackluster dividend growth is becoming a trend for the discount retailer. The retail industry is aggressively competitive, and things are tougher than ever for brick-and-mortar operators because of increasing pressure from online players in the past several years. Wal-Mart is actively investing in people and technology to expand its online presence, and the company recently announced the acquisition of Jet.com for $3.3 billion to gain ground in e-commerce. Management is doing the right thing by putting the company's long-term strategic position above current profit margins. However, investments for online growth are taking a toll on profit margins, and consolidated operating income excluding the sale of Chinese e-commerce marketplace Yihaodian declined 7.2% last quarter. The stock is paying a dividend yield of 2.7% at current prices, a premium over an average dividend yield of 2.3% for companies in the S&P 500 index. In addition, Wal-Mart has a conservatively low dividend payout ratio of around 46% versus earnings forecasts for the current year, so dividend sustainability is not in question. However, as long as earnings remain under pressure, chances are that Wal-Mart will continue raising its dividends at a modest rate over the middle term.  Connectivity problems AT&T stock is paying an attractive dividend yield of 4.7% at current prices. On the other hand, the company has raised dividends by only $0.01 annually since 2009. These minuscule dividend increases are barely enough for AT&T to retain its status as a dividend aristocrat, but the company is really not offering much in terms of dividend growth. The telecom business is going through massive challenges since internet and related technologies are reducing communications costs across the board, which is putting considerable pressure on different industry operators. AT&T acquired DirecTV in 2015, and the company is now the biggest provider of pay TV services around the world. However, the pay-TV industry is also facing a major threat because of cord-cutting and the online streaming revolution, so AT&T is on the wrong side of major technological trends in its two main businesses. Wall Street analysts are on average estimating that AT&T will produce $2.86 in earnings per share during the current year. This puts the dividend yield at nearly 67% versus earnings expectations. Unless the company can materially accelerate earnings growth over the middle term, this doesn't allow much room for rapid dividend increases going forward. A business in transition Procter & Gamble made a series of mistakes over the past several years. The company entered too many markets, and product innovation didn't work out as expected. This produced a stagnation in revenue growth at the consumer-staples giant.  In order to jump-start performance, the company is transforming itself into a nimbler and more flexible organization. Procter & Gamble has sold nearly 100 underperforming brands over the past couple of years, and the company is embarked on an ambitious cost savings program. In cost of goods sold alone, Procter & Gamble has achieved over $7 billion cumulative savings since 2012. This transformation will probably be a good thing for investors in Procter & Gamble over the long term, but dividend growth has materially decelerated lately. The company raised dividends by 1% in 2016, a considerable slowdown from 3% dividend growth in 2015 and 7% in 2014. The dividend payout ratio is in the area of 70% versus earnings estimates for 2016, so the company will need to improve earnings growth if it's going to revitalize dividend payments in the future. The dividend yield is above average, though, in the area of 3.05%. The Foolish bottom line Don't get me wrong: Dividend aristocrats such as Wal-Mart, AT&T, and Procter & Gamble are solid and dependable dividend stocks, and they're good candidates for investors looking for defensive plays and current income. On the other hand, those looking for vigorous dividend growth should focus on younger companies with superior potential for expansion over the coming years.

The reason: Facebook's promise of "targeted marketing" simply doesn't deliver the goods. P&G have got better results – particularly for its air freshener, Febreze, by going back to old-fashioned mass marketing. I could say I told you so, but many of the digital clevers out there – and brand managers desperate to appear technologically hip – won’t listen. The reality is that the old “dinosaurs” like TV and print still work. One of the reasons newspapers are still a highly effective advertising channel is that readers do pay attention to the ads. In some cases, readers remember the ads before they remember the deathless prose of yours truly. This is especially true where the ad has a price or a number in it: print can be very effective as a call-to-action and retail medium. If a price is truly appealing, and the surroundings appealing, then a print ad is powerful. The Trafalgar ad Another one caught my eye this week in The Star, for Trafalgar, the well-known tour and travel company. The main image in the ad showed a couple, against the backdrop of what could be an old European castle or city wall, about to tuck into some delicious ice creams. The headline said, simply: “Taste your way around Europe”. Below that was a real call-to-action line: “+Save 10%”. There followed details of some of the company’s European itineraries, which all feature food in some way. Along with these were the all-important numbers, price and savings. I bet many people lingered over it and did their sums. It’s effective advertising and it works because it’s in print. And good value, too... So the first Orchid this week goes to Trafalgar. Advertisement And to show how effective TV can be, especially when the ad is well shot and directed, I was mesmerised by a Checkers commercial for its top quality pork offerings. It featured a number of top South African chefs and pork dishes they prepared. To say it was mouth-watering doesn’t come close. Both my wife and I noticed it. It positioned pork as something to salivate over and it positioned Checkers as the place to get the best. Checkers has done this before and got Orchids from me, most notably for its food. So, here’s another sizzling, tasty one for you, Checkers. Well done. One of the grammatical, and common sense, rules that people often get wrong is the use of “ever”, or “all time”. Both those phrases mean exactly what they say. So if you boast that your product is the “best ever”, you are saying, somewhat stupidly, that it will never be bettered. Never say never. Overuse use of ever is never going to make it correct, just as feet are different from metres. And difference does make a difference: I would hope the pilot flying the plane I am in would know the difference between feet and metres. So, I was irritated this past weekend when Caltex kicked off its latest national promotion by saying it was offering the “best prizes ever”. Even if they had used correct grammar – “best prizes to date” – they would have fallen a long way short. Please people, a number of vouchers for a road trip of R15,000 each (including fuel) are hardly the best in history up to now. They are not that great by today’s standards. The chances of them being the “best ever” are, therefore, nil.

Just What Is the 'Agency of the Future' and Has Omnicom Built It? Dedicated McDonald's Shop Takes Leap Toward New Model, But It's One of Many Approaches By Jack Neff. Published on September 06, 2016. Reprints Reprints Explosion Credit: iStock Marc Pritchard might have said it best: "Frankly, your complexity should not be our problem, so we want you to make that complexity invisible." Addressing agencies at Ad Age's Digital Conference in April, the Procter & Gamble Global Brand Officer added that "our expectation is that over time, our agency partners, whoever we choose, are going to be able to integrate [all of the workload], so you can get the production out, the distribution out as well as the creative out." It's not just P&G. Amid a movement toward transparency, marketers broadly are demanding that agencies simplify processes while still delivering a complex array of marketing services specific to their needs. They want to cull agency lineups, using fewer agencies or at least a single agency or other party to lead the multidisciplinary throng. Making that happen gets even tougher as media continues to fragment, increasing marketer demand for advertising and other content to feed a growing array of channels, and for a wider variety of providers from outside the tradititonal agency world to fill the void. This "agency of the future" is what Omnicom Group says it will bring to McDonald's, following its win last week of a closely watched review it won out over Publicis Groupe. This unnamed multidisciplinary shop will have 200 staffers and will partner on site with employees from Google, Facebook, the New York Times content studio in addition to people from other Omnicom agencies, including digital shop Critical Mass, Omnicom Media Group, multicultural shop Alma, and boutique agency Sparks & Honey. Pushing for years It's the latest iteration of an agency-of-the-future idea some big marketers and agency holding companies have been pushing for years. WPP, which bowed out of the McDonald's contest over reported concerns about cost pressures, has been perhaps the biggest proponent to date, deploying such hybrid custom agencies from Ford (Global Team Blue) to Colgate-Palmolive Co. (Red Fuse). Michael Fanuele Credit: General Mills Similarly, General Mills is seeking for its U.S. grocery business "one core agency to handle the bulk [of the work] but to supplement with other partners, which might be technology platforms or media partners," said Chief Creative Officer Michael Fanuele, or "an anchor agency supplemented with a roster of interesting partners." One of the participants in the General Mills pitch is Publicis Groupe, which is proposing a holding-company solution, yet there are others in the hunt not pitching in that manner, including McCann, Deutsch, Mother and 72andSunny. "This an exercise in finding the right partners, not the right model," said Mr. Fanuele. David Beals, CEO of consulting firm JLB and Partners, said he sees few clients clamoring for a custom holding-company solution taken by Omnicom for McDonald's. "It gets reported when it happens, because it's big news," Mr. Beals said. "But there are down sides to the model that in reality prevents it from becoming more pervasive." The talent issue Chief among those, he said, "Is how do you attract top creative talent if you're an agency that's just in service to one client?" Even if the custom agencies after a year or two open up to outside clients -- as is the plan with Omnicom's McDonald's shop or WPP's Global Team Blue -- he said, "in the meantime you're asking people to work for a year or two with only one client only." The alternate approach of periodically pulling people in from other agencies creates additional logistical issues, which include holding-company turf wars and avoiding the conflict issues that maintaining separate agency brands within holding companies is designed to circumvent.

Increasingly, for example, P&G brands don't have both a general creative and digital agency, and while statistics aren't broadly available, Mr. Beals believes a single agency covering both is becoming the norm. Unilever, in the midst of simplifying its own marketing ranks in its latest reorganization, is looking to simplify agency lineups too, according to people familiar with the matter. Unilever's zero-based budgeting exercise -- similar to what dozens of other big marketers have undertaken in recent years -- essentially makes the question of whether the company needs as many agencies as it has now part of the process. But ultimately, it also comes down to longing for the days when a brand had basically one agency and a fear that specialization breeds distraction and waste. "One of the things that concerns me most is the potential fragmentation of our brands," said Unilever Chief Marketing and Communications Officer Keith Weed in an interview at Cannes in June. "You have lots of agencies telling you this is what you have to do to be fluent on mobile, on social, on search. And if you're not careful, the brands get pulled in different ways." Gerry Preece, a P&G marketing procurement alum and now senior consultant with External View Consulting Group, said the quest for simplification and finding a new, more functional agency model is the top business generator for his firm at this point. Gerry Preece Credit: Gerry Preece "It's driven by a fundamental dissatisfaction with the way things are going," he said. "Agency structures are still too siloed, and integration is too hard to do." Marathon training It's also clear that simplification is no sprint, more like a marathon on a twisting road. Take P&G, which nearly a decade ago began an effort to simplify its far-flung marketing-services system at a time when the company had an estimated 2,500 agencies and roughly $1 billion in agency and production spending. It implemented a Brand Agency Leader system that designated a point agency to work with all the rest. By 2014, though, P&G was working with 6,000 marketing-services agencies and spending around $2 billion annually. Thanks to a new round of consolidation and simplicity efforts, the company has reduced those numbers to around 3,600 agencies and $1.4 billion. But simplification remains far from simple. Despite Mr. Pritchard's call for simplification, the urge to try new agencies and models is hard to resist. Amid its broad agency culling, P&G's SK-II brand went outside its main agency Leo Burnett to tap hot Swedish independent shop Forsman & Bodenfors for an SK-II project in China that focused on single women over 25 cruelly referred to as "leftover women," which won a Glass Lion at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. For another recent project, P&G's Olay tapped a team of five video bloggers represented by Gen.video to come to its Cincinnati headquarters, talk with researchers and create videos for a new line of eye creams that was used on the brand website, adapted by the bloggers for their site and used as advertising on e-commerce sites. It's a different approach really dictated by how media is changing, Mr. Pritchard said in an interview: "The paid and earned advertising world are blending together as never before," he said. "This is a different approach for a new ecosystem." It's also one more sign that work that once done by ad agencies can now come from many places, including media companies or video bloggers building their own miniature media empires on the backs of other media companies. Frenemies Nowhere was that more obvious than at the Cannes International Festival of Creativity, where frenemies lurked everywhere as everyone to some extent was looking to get into someone else's business. Facebook and Google were there, looking in part to expand their direct relationships with marketers, which include developing creative and media planning in some cases, albeit also heavily focused on working with agencies. IBM was there to tout not just data and analytics, but also its agency services. And WPP's J. Walter Thompson won Creative Data and Cyber Grand Prix awards for a project seemingly worthy of IBM's Watson -- "The Next Rembrandt," which used facial recognition, predictive data modeling and ED imaging to create what it projected Rembrandt's final painting would have looked like had he lived a bit longer. Beyond the question of what is JWT doing in the predictive analytics business is the question of why is IBM in the agency business? It's taken a bigger plunge of late, acquiring independent digital shop Resource Ammirati and adding former Unilever VP-global media innovation Babs Rangaiah to lead its Global Marketing Solutions Effort earlier this year. Babs Rangaiah Credit: Rohanna Mertens A big part of what IBM looks to do is actually to help manage, not add to, the complexity, Mr. Rangaiah said, for example by helping companies do some of the work he was doing at Unilever in navigating a particularly complex chunk of the marketing universe – the ever denser thicket of ad-tech providers. "In the past the advertising agency was the right hand of the CMO," he said. "In the past three to five years, with the increased importance of technology and data, that just hasn't been the relationship, and the CMO or anyone working on a brand can't just count on the ad agency to lead that." Beyond offering some agency services, Mr. Rangaiah believes the IBM iX unit he works for can work as the integrator of the marketing effort. "I don't think it's so much of a turf war as an urgent struggle to get marketing right," Mr. Preece said of the increasingly crowded field of agency types, and he believes the core problem is that the industry has yet to identify exactly who should integrate all their efforts. In many cases, marketers themselves are comfortable handling the job of parceling out work among various agencies, said Mr. Beals. But Mr. Preece believes the marketers "are in an even weaker position than 10 years ago to do this, because marketing organizations have been stripped down." Mr. Preece said he led the group at P&G that once helped do this, but said, "It's a very labor-intensive thing, and for a typical marketer it's tough to do. Most agencies aren't structured to do it either." The nitty gritty of the integration work requires skills such as optimization of work processes and attention to detail more akin to cost accounting or logistics management, he said, "which is the kind of work most agencies eschew. It's not who they want to be. But it's becoming more and more critical to marketing. And somebody's going to have to build it, or marketing is just going to be inefficient." Handing the job off to a consultant or other third party just adds another layer of cost and complexity, he said. And he believes agency holding companies are in the best position to actually do the job, given that they own many or most of the pieces needed and merger-and-acquisition executives who have a purview of the external market. But he doesn't believe holding companies have generally developed people designed to put all the pieces together for marketers. "Integration is something that as an industry we are not well structured to handle," he said. "And the need there has exploded because the complexity has exploded."

Here’s how some top marketers approach it now Sep 6, 2016 Amy Laski   YouTube star Troye Sivan meeting fans at Fan Fest 2015. Brand marketers are still figuring out how best to manage relationships with influencers like Sivan. (Don Arnold/Getty) If only we still watched daytime soap operas. I can’t say I’ve ever felt compelled to watch them myself—but as a business owner and marketer in today’s highly fragmented media landscape, I must admit that simpler times—when the original “sponsored content” could reach millions every day—have a certain appeal. It was 1933, after all, when Procter & Gamble began producing sensationalized radio dramas as a way to deliver its advertising to homemakers, and it later made the leap to television (the company went on to produce blockbuster soap operas like Another World, As The World Turns, and Guiding Light). This innovation helped P&G captivate a vast audience of housewives each afternoon and attain market leadership against key competitor Lever Brothers. If you were a marketer in the mid-20th century, you could devote most of your budget to one source that was clearly and explicitly advertising, then call it a day. For decades, the dominant model of marketing has been brands “talking to” consumers, as they did in the golden age of soap operas. Brands would transmit a message, without any sort of expectation by consumers of conversation or reciprocity. Being “engaged” with a brand meant buying it, and little else. Now, consumers expect a brand to “talk with” them, to engage them beyond the functional benefits of a product and into the transcendental benefits of being associated with that brand. Like it or not, two-way, consultative conversations are considered table stakes today. Brands that don’t open themselves up to these conversations risk appearing dated and impervious. As a result, the old “outreach” model is dead. It has to evolve into an “inreach” approach, whereby the former recipients of marketing communications are “insourced,” or embedded within a brand’s core processes, from planning through execution. Optimism is the heart of great marketing Yet, our mission as marketers remains the same. Canadian Business marketing columnist Bruce Philp said it best: “We still show up for work in the morning to make something people want, present it to those people and sell it to them at a price that leaves everybody satisfied. The tools for doing it have evolved continuously for a century, but the essence of marketing is the same as it ever was.” Putting this into play, however, can pose a major challenge for business leaders today. Successful brands need to engage their audiences and stakeholders in two-way conversations. But according to the fifth McKinsey & Company Global Survey on external affairs,”[engaging external stakeholders] ranks as a top or top three priority for more than half of CEOs…yet only 17 percent say their companies are very effective at tailoring their narratives.” While social media makes it easier to reach target audiences, it’s getting more challenging to engage and influence them. So what are some of the new rules of engagement? And what tools and solutions are proving effective, particularly when it comes to working with bloggers, influencers, content creators, and media? As our thoughts turn to nailing down plans for the year ahead, it’s a good time to start thinking about these new rules of engagement. I checked in with some of our client partners and respected brand leaders for their take on today’s marketing landscape, and what we can all be doing to best navigate it. Made to measure…but what? At General Mills, Associate Marketing Manager Nicole Korb says several of the company’s brands work directly with influencers and bloggers, a trend that is, without question, continuing to gain momentum. “As marketers, we’re obsessed with measurement. We want to see how any given ‘lever’ we’ve pulled can impact sales. Ideally, we’d want to see how sales have increased based on our work with influencers. I haven’t seen that so far, but we respect the work of influencers more and more, because we see the impact [on engagement metrics] when an influencer shares our content.” For example, General Mills works with Bewitchin’ Kitchen and Dinner with Julie for its “Life Made Delicious” social platform. These bloggers concoct new recipes each month using a variety of the company’s products, then blog about them. Looking at numbers alone when evaluating an influencer partnership may not actually be that effective, given followers can be “bought.” The focus should be in quality vs. quantity: fit with your brand, engagement levels and the composition of the influencer’s viewership or readership. And like any prospective investment, brands should still begin with their bottom line business goals and then use those to orient communications goals and strategies. These may be measurable in dollars and percentage points, or improved brand perception and purchase intent over time. From transaction to trust While even a few years ago it would have been deemed unethical to “buy” media coverage (unless of course it was clearly labeled “advertorial”), today, there are entire companies dedicated to enabling brand leaders to buy coverage from so-called social influencers. These influencers have earned loyal followings based on their unique points-of-view and the compelling ways in which they express them. But, while they may have “earned” the right to be paid for the content they create, is the resulting content deemed credible by consumers? That remains uncertain. How new rules could change Canada’s social media marketing landscape Pay-to-play transactional content may have a place in an integrated communications plan, but should not be the only pillar. Furthermore, both sides of the proverbial coin benefit from a policy of full disclosure when payment has been exchanged for content. While this has been mandated in the United States, here in Canada consumers will still have to sift through it all for themselves and make their own decisions about what can be trusted and what cannot, at least until early 2017 when Advertising Standards Canada plans to introduce disclosure rules here. Even when these are in place, it is questionable whether sponsored content will be discernible, particularly since the non-compliance process and consequences are as murky as disclosure is for many influencers. In our team’s work with creators (bloggers, YouTubers, Instagrammers and the like) we have heard, time and again, that they’re eager to establish longer-term relationships with brands, rather than “pay to play” transactional ones. This desire is echoed on the brand side as well. According to Holly deGraaf, Interim General Manager and Director, Retail Operations and Public Relations at Ten Thousand Villages Canada, “The highest [impact is made] when what [bloggers] share and write doesn’t look like— [or better yet, isn’t]—a paid endorsement. The beauty of many bloggers is that their followers feel like they are connecting with a friend. To sully that by having too much of a paid content feel could be detrimental.” The penultimate goal is to strike the right balance to produce paid or company-generated content as good as high-quality editorial, such that it will be embraced by consumers. Many brands either err too much on the “advertorial” side, where consumers tune out veritable propaganda, or the content is too soft and fails to set up the story to sell-in the product. An example of a brand that’s getting it right is Ontario’s liquor distributor, the LCBO, with its glossy magazine Food & Drink. Graham Robertson is the former VP Marketing with Johnson & Johnson Canada and is now President and CMO at Beloved Brands. He says, he “doesn’t know why anyone would want to follow a media outlet that just pumps out sponsored content all the time. If only one out of every 10 messages is authentic, they will be losing followers.” Nicole Korb from General Mills weighs in: “Right now, we treat PR [and influencer/blogger relations] as a media buy, as a channel. There are increasingly opportunities to collaborate and co-create with influencers, and brands need to do more of that.” Crossing the line There’s no question that we’re in the age of information overload.  Robertson says, “There’s just too much out there. People are no longer seeking out news and knowledge, they are filtering through it. ” He looks forward to its evolution—a “settling down”—to a more credible, focused and consolidated, media environment. The five skills marketers of the future will need As communicators, marketers, media, stakeholders and influencers all navigate this new ecosystem, one thing is certain: collaboration is a necessity for doing business today and going forward. We need to shift our approach from the old-school “outreach” model to an “in-reach” model, which actively cultivates and incorporates the thoughts of influencers and stakeholders in every facet of business, from product development to content co-creation to crisis communications. Mattel did this last year in their quest to evolve Barbie into a more true-to-life body type: They brought together a group of carefully selected female leaders, including Canadian icon Erica Ehm. In a series of meetings at Mattel headquarters with top decision-makers, these women not only helped shepherd major changes for the Barbie brand in a way that would resonate with parents and their kids, but also fostered fandom amongst the female leaders who took part. As Ehm said, “I’m so proud to have played a tiny part in re-imagining Barbie to become a doll that girls can see themselves in, no matter their size, shape or colour.” This inreach model—or as our team is calling it, our “content collective approach”—is mutually beneficial. So when you’re sitting down at the table to plan for 2017 and beyond, you’ll want to have the right people who influence your target’s opinions—and your bottom line—at the table, engaged in the right way. No soap opera dramatics necessary. Amy Laski is founder and president of Felicity [Inspiring Communications], a communications and content agency based in Toronto. Prior to starting Felicity, Amy worked at Coca-Cola Canada and at several leading Canadian PR agencies.

Lowdown: NFL Splits Auto Sponsors as Ford Joins Hyundai in Three-Year Deal Published on September 07, 2016. Ford is now the official truck of the NFL: Ford's Mark Laneve, NFL Hall of Famer Anthony Munoz and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell Credit: The Ford Motor Company The Lowdown is Ad Age's weekly look at news nuggets from across the world of marketing, including trends, campaign tidbits, executive comings and goings and more. Hyundai's reign as the NFL's only automotive sponsor ended today when Ford announced a three-year deal as the official truck of the NFL. Hyundai's four-year deal began last year when the Korean brand replaced General Motors, which had sponsored the NFL since 2001. Splitting categories into two like this is unique, but not unprecedented in professional sports. For instance, the Los Angeles Rams recently announced a deal to make Corona its official imported beer, while Bud Light is expected to remain as the team's domestic beer sponsor. Hyundai's fleet is dominated by cars. While it sells crossovers and SUVs, it does not sell trucks, making the NFL's deal with Ford a little less threatening. "There is not a lot of overlap between a Hyundai Santa Fe customer and a Ford F-150 customer. If there was, that is where it might get a little bit problematic," said Jim Andrews, senior VP-marketing for sponsorship consultancy IEG. A Hyundai spokesman said the automaker has known there would be a truck sponsor since day one. "Like Hyundai, Ford recognizes the value in being an NFL sponsor and reaching the millions of passionate fans who are gearing up for the start of the season tomorrow," the spokesman said. "We are extremely pleased with how our sponsorship has unfolded so far and have some exciting plans for year two. As the official car, SUV and luxury car of the NFL, we have exclusivity in the categories where Hyundai sells vehicles." Ford's deal includes a "Built Ford Tough Offensive Line of the Week award." Ford also plans to run a "Built Ford Tough Tailgate Tour." Stated Ford: "These experiences will give consumers access to their own Built Ford Tough Tailgates on demand on game day, as well as hard-to-get game tickets." Could the deal also mean Ford might advertise in the Super Bowl? The spokeswoman said there is "nothing to share on Super Bowl yet." Turning to brand mascot news … Mr. Clean usually has been an animated figure during his 57 years on TV, which helps limit SAG-AFTRA payments and keeps him out of trouble after hours, but the Procter & Gamble Co. brand, fresh off reviving the iconic jingle, is going out on a limb by issuing an open casting call for a live-action Mr. Clean to appear in a limited-edition 2017 calendar. A teaser video featuring Twilight star Kellan Lutz failing his audition directs would-be applicants to details at TheNextMrClean.com. "We found Mr. Clean has such a strong heritage and we hadn't necessarily been taking best advantage of that," said Kevin Wenzel, associate brand director. "Phase one was revitalizing the jingle, which has gotten off to a phenomenal start." Sales have accelerated in the seven weeks since the new jingle in three languages came out, and Mr. Wenzel hopes for a similar boost from publicity surrounding a new Mr. Clean. While the gig, which comes with a $20,000 prize, initially just includes the calendar appearance, he said it could ultimately work into other advertising or public appearances. Where does mayonnaise come from? Unilever is trying to answer that with two video spots that included a live-stream from a real Hellmann's Canola Farm in Canada. Launched in Canada, it's the first North American work for Unilever from Cubocc New York, an offshoot of a Brazilian agency and part of Interpublic's Flagcx "creative disruption network," which bills itself as a "post advertising agency." The agency was also responsible last year for Axe's "Romeo Remix" in Brazil, a modern remake of the Romeo and Juliet story with thousands of versions served to people programmatically based on such things as their taste in music or movie genres. A week after abandoning its plan to buy Hershey, Mondelez International is making chocolate plans on its own. On Wednesday, Mondelez said it will pursue a major expansion into the U.S. chocolate market. Those plans include marketing an Oreo Milka chocolate bar in the United States, a product that's already a hit for the company elsewhere. Oreo Milka 300g Bar Credit: Mondelez International Mondelez already sells the Milka with Oreo product in about 20 markets, including Germany. And It is branded as Cadbury Dairy Milk with Oreo in big Cadbury markets such as the U.K. and Australia. "With our strong brands and global expertise in chocolate, we see enormous potential to grow our U.S. business and expand the category," Chief Growth Officer Tim Cofer said in a statement. Other U.S. plans include expanding its higher-end Green & Blacks line. Mondelez is currently a distant 8th in the U.S. chocolate confectionery market with 1.7% market share, well below leader Hershey's 31.6% share, according to Euromonitor International. Globally, Mondelez ranks second behind Mars, with 13.6% market share. JC Penney plus-size clothing collection Credit: JC Penney In advance of New York Fashion Week, which begins Thursday, JC Penney hosted its own runway show on Tuesday outside its Manhattan store. The live-streaming event, which highlighted looks from the retailer's new plus-size clothing collection from "Project Runway" winner Ashley Nell Tipton, was open to the public and included a "braid bar" hair-styling outpost, photo booth with a cardboard cutout of Ms. Tipton, and "bold lip" salon for passersby. The Plano, Texas-based retailer also debuted a three-part video series about the collection in late August. After a decade as CEO, Hormel's Jeffrey Ettinger plans to retire from that role on Oct. 30. Mr. Ettinger will remain chairman of the board, while Hormel President and Chief Operating Officer James Snee will become the Spam maker's next CEO as of Oct. 31. Mr. Ettinger, with Hormel since 1989 and CEO since 2006, helped the company grow in part through a series of acquisitions, including this year's purchase of the Justin's brand. He was the eighth leader to oversee Hormel's longstanding relationship with BBDO. In 2013, Mr. Ettinger spoke highly of BBDO Minneapolis when the marketer and agency won the gold in Ad Age's first agency-client-marriage contest. Contributing: E.J.

Mumbai: Mindshare, the Group M agency, managed to secure the agency of the year title at the 16th edition of The EMVIES Awards on Friday. The agency has picked this title eight times in the last 16 years, winning the top spot from 2008-2016, with the exception of one year—2014, when it lost the title to sister agency, Maxus. The agency took home a total of one Grand Emvie (the only one awarded on Friday evening), eight gold, eight silver and 15 bronze metals. “The awards are a direct result of the effort and hard work put in by each and everyone in the team. We at Mindshare believe in recognizing our employees’ skills and commitment, which is further driven to a level of aspiration that leads to rewarding experiences such as the Emvies. Winning these awards by such a large margin is not only a testimony to our accomplishments so far, but also significantly adds to the quality of service we intend to deliver. Creating ground-breaking innovations and strategies has been Mindshare’s forte and this has kept us at the forefront in the industry,” said Prasanth Kumar, CEO South Asia, Mindshare alluding to the agency’s total score of 395 points. Mindshare was followed by Lodestar UM, which amassed a total of 135 points, with six gold, three silver and three bronze metals. Maxus, also a GroupM company, shared the second place with a score of 135 points including four gold, five silver and five bronze metals. Hindustan Unilever Ltd took home the client of the year award, followed by Pepsico India Holdings Ltd in the second place and Procter & Gamble India Ltd in the third place. Mindshare took home the only Grand Emvie awarded on Friday night for their work for Pepsico India, under the best integrated campaign category for consumer products. The campaign, titled ‘Crash the Pepsi IPL’, was an initiative where the brand invited consumers to create ads for the product and share it. The five best entries were then picked by consumers themselves. The initiative received over 2,600 entries, 900 of which were shortlisted. This pool was further filtered down to 33 finalists, of which five ads were judged winners. The agency also picked up numerous awards for their work for HUL’s Brooke Bond Red Label tea brand, the six pack band—India’s first transgender band, among others. The idea, which was created jointly by the brand team at HUL, Mindshare and Y-Films, picked up six gold, one silver and two bronze metals. The golds were won for best innovation in—branded content, digital social media, radio and digital multiple platform, best media strategy—consumer products and the best use of Bollywood celebrity. Incidentally, this campaign also won India a Glass Lions Grand Prix at the 63rd International Festival of Creativity in Cannes. The Glass Lion category was introduced to celebrate culture-shifting creativity that positively impacts gender inequality, imbalance and injustice. “I must first of all congratulate our clients who push us to keep raising the bar year after year. Clients who believe in innovation and back our teams to take risks are the ones who win and in turn help us win,” said C.V.L. Srinivas, CEO, GroupM South Asia. Lodestar UM won four gold awards for their inspiring work for the Door Step School, a non-governmental organization that was established with the aim of addressing literacy in marginalised sections of society. The campaign saw them naming no-name alleys and narrow lanes in the slums after children who had done well academically or had risen above their circumstances to achieve something. This was used as a way to motivate the children to stay in school and do better, as well as create role models for others to follow. “While this project was difficult to execute as it involved obtaining permissions from the civic authorities, educational department, political parties, local corporators, among others, it was a unique and innovative initiative to celebrate these symbols of societal change. It was to about inspiring them to continue their education and do something they could be proud of,” said Dhruv Jha, GM, IPG Mediabrands. The agency also won two golds for their work for Salaam Bombay Foundation, wherein they created future resumes for three little girls who each aspired to become a lawyer, chartered accountant and an engineer. The agency got human resources (HR) and recruitment firms on board and sent out the resumes to potential employers were surprised to find a little girl, with her future resume. They appealed to companies urging them to help so they could complete their education and actually go on and pick the career of their dreams. The EMVIES Awards, conducted by The Advertising Club (TAC India), recognises outstanding work done by media agencies. With over 29% increase in agency participation, the awards have further grown in impact and inclusivity, said a statement from the industry body. The 2016 awards were adjudged by an eminent jury of 225 media and marketing professionals through judging sessions held in Mumbai and Delhi. “In today’s day and age of extensive media exposure, the greatest challenge is to create clutter breaking communication that is impactful, optimal and delivers the brand message. As always this year too at the EMVIES we have seen works by media agencies that have not only been pioneering and engaging but also helped change mindsets and helped drive resonance for the brand,” said Punitha Arumugam, chairperson, EMVIES committee.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Sep 6, 2016 at 8:30PM Image source: The Motley Fool. Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) got a much-needed shot in the arm in after-hours trading on Tuesday, when it was announced that Pershing Square Capital Management has purchased 9.9% of the burrito chain. Chipotle's stock is "undervalued and is an attractive investment," says Pershing. Pershing Square is one of the best known hedge funds in the world thanks to its founder Bill Ackman. The billionaire investor has assumed an increasingly activist bent over the past few years, most recently stirring a shake-up at consumer-products giant Procter & Gamble that ended in the ouster of its chairman and CEO. He's also been publicly active in attacking Herbalife, calling the multilevel-marketing company a Ponzi scheme and shorting its stock. And earlier this year, Ackman testified before Congress concerning his investment in Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which has drawn fire for raising the price of prescription drugs. By the sounds of it, Ackman's intentions toward Chipotle are friendly, as Pershing Square's regulatory filing announcing the stake compliments both Chipotle and its leaders: "[Chipotle] is a leading fast casual restaurant company that [Pershing Square] believes has a strong brand, differentiated offering, enormous growth opportunity, and visionary leadership." At the same time, Pershing is clear that it intends to engage with Chipotle's leadership: "[Pershing] intends to engage in discussions with [Chipotle] and [Chipotle's] management and board of directors, other stockholders [...] and other interested parties that may relate to the governance and board composition, business, operations, cost structure, management, assets, capitalization, financial condition, strategic plans, and the future of [Chipotle]." It's impossible to say what this means for Chipotle, though I'd be hesitant to assume that Ackman's presence will augur in any type of substantive change in direction for the restaurant chain, which is already capably managed. A more likely outcome is it will just improve investor sentiment toward Chipotle's stock, which of course would be much appreciated. Shares of Chipotle have struggled since a series of foodborne-illness outbreaks at the end of last year caused its sales to fall sharply. In the first quarter of this year, same-store sales at locations open at least a year dropped 29.7%. They improved in the second quarter but were still off by 23.6%. The effect on Chipotle's share price has been significant. After reaching $750 a share in 2015, they fell to as low as $384 last month. Before Pershing's announcement, they were at $414 per share -- down 45% from last year's high. Thus, while the surge in after=hours trading following today's news will only make up a little of this deficit and the gains may be fleeting, it's safe to say that Chipotle investors will take what they can get right about now.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    A divided House of Representatives is keeping several crucial pieces of key legislation for the nation's veterans from advancing, Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert McDonald said Tuesday, while addressing the massive transformation the nation's primary veterans agency has been undergoing in the past two years since he was brought on board. "We have put forward 100 different pieces of legislation that we need to continue this transformation," McDonald told MSNBC's "Morning Joe" program. "Some of them are absolutely critical to veterans getting [assistance]." The most important legislation would cover extensions and providers agreements, said McDonald, noting that the Senate has been working together and has passed the Veterans First Act out of committee unanimously. That legislation, if passed, will serve to improve the accountability of employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs and to improve healthcare and benefits for veterans while amending Title 38, the U.S. code governing veterans' benefits.  However, the House's divisiveness is "not allowing these things to get through committee and to the floor," said McDonald, insisting the lag is not because of a funding issue. "I think there's a tremendous unanimity what needs to be done, but it's just the matter of having political will to get it done," he told the program. McDonald was brought in from the private sector after being with Procter & Gamble for 30 years, including running the company, with President Barack Obama tasking him with making it the VA run like a successful healthcare business. "We have hired more doctors, put in more space, more nurses, expanded hours," said McDonald. "We've driven down disability claim backlog by 90 percent, from its peak of 600,000 and we've cut veteran homelessness in about half since 2010. We are making progress but we've got more to do." McDonald took over a VA that was plagued with scandal following revelations that wait lists had been falsified to conceal chronically long wait times for care. The VA is in the midst of implementing a new scheduling system, to replace one dating back to 1995, said McDonald, and has hired a former Johnson & Johnson IT director to work on the VA's issues. "Fourteen of 17 of my top managers are new," said McDonald. "We're in the midst of a transformation." GOP nominee Donald Trump has spoken of privatizing some of the VA's functions, but McDonald thinks that is a bad idea. "When I came in, before my Senate confirmation, some senators asked me to look at that," said McDonald. "I'm a business guy and I look at those kinds of things. What I discovered was not only do veterans need the VA and want the VA, but also American public and American medicine needs the VA." Many key advances have come from the VA, including the nation's first implantable pacemaker, the first liver transplant, the first kidney transplant, and the shingles vaccine, noted the secretary. "The VA trained 70 percent of doctors in this country," said McDonald. "Without the VA, who would train those doctors? Then clinical care. Over 80 percent of veterans say they prefer getting their care at the VA, and they recommend it to a friend." September is National Suicide Prevention Month, and McDonald said the VA is making a special effort toward preventing suicide among veterans, after a report this summer revealed an estimated 20 vets commit suicide every day. "There's no question that any suicide of any veteran is a terrible thing," said McDonald. "The biggest challenge is how we get people connected. We have a new hashtag that we are doing on Twitter. "We really need the help of the American public. When you notice the signs, get them connected. Call our crisis line. Let's get them connected so we can treat them."

(espensorvik/Flickr/Creative Commons) Join us on our podcast each weekday for an interesting story, well told, from Charisma News. Listen at charismapodcastnetwork.com. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday banned some over-the-counter antibacterial hand and body wash products, saying they are no more effective than soap and water and could cause long-term harm. The move affects 2,100 products, or roughly 40 percent of the over-the-counter antibacterialsoap market, Dr. Theresa Michele, director of the FDA's division of nonprescription drug products, told reporters on a conference call. The ruling does not affect alcohol-based hand sanitizers or antibacterial products used in hospitals and clinics. The agency said it is banning products that contain any one of 19 ingredients that have not been proven safe. Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble Co and Colgate-Palmolive Co have said they have either reformulated or are reformulating their products to delete the most common of the 19 ingredients, including triclosan and triclocarban. FDA spokeswoman Andrea Fischer and Brian Sansoni, of the American Cleaning Institute, which represents multiple cleaning products companies, were unable to identify the products most affected by Friday's ruling. The FDA had proposed banning the ingredients in 2013 unless companies could prove they were safe and effective, but was unsatisfied with the data. The ACI, whose members include Dial Corp., a unit of Germany's Henkel, insists the products are effective. <a href="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=6421ee36eb&cb=861630843" ><img src="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873539&cs=6421ee36eb&cb=861630843" border="0" alt=""></a> advertisement "Clearly this is an industry that needed a good, swift kick in the triclosan. It took far too long," said Ken Cook, the president of the Environmental Working Group, a non-profit environmental research organization. Thomas DiPiazza, a spokesman for Colgate-Palmolive, said none of the company's products in the continental United States are affected, although a "small quantity of our bar soap in Puerto Rico, where FDA rules also apply, is being reformulated." Procter & Gamble spokeswoman Tressi Rose said it will replace "a few" products well in advance of the FDA's deadline for removing or reformulating the products a year from now. The regulator also deferred by a year a ruling on three additional ingredients used in consumer wash products – benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride and chloroxylenol (PCMX) – to allow for the submission of new safety and effectiveness data for those ingredients. Consumer antibacterial washes containing those specific ingredients may be sold during this time, the FDA said. Manufacturers are conducting research to fill data gaps identified by the FDA, Sansoni said. © 2016 Thomson Reuters.

Grab these big-upside opportunities before they vanish. Thinkstock By Brian Nichols September 8, 2016 The stock markets may be near all-time highs, but there are countless high-quality large-cap stocks to buy that keep getting pushed lower, simply haven’t risen with the rest of their peers or remain grossly underpriced despite recent gains. It is absolutely inexcusable that some of these stocks keep flying under the radar as screaming buys. Much of Wall Street hasn’t noticed, but the value and upside are too apparent for anyone just willing to look. See Also from Kiplinger: 3 Battered Stocks to Buy While They Are Down This fact almost guarantees that two years from now, each of these noted securities will have outperformed the market. Advertisement With that said, I have seven stocks to buy that are beaten-down, disrespected and poised to beat the market in the years to come. You’ve heard of every one of these names, but you might not be familiar with the great value case at play right now. Gilead Sciences The fact that Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD) stock trades at $78 per share and less than 7 times earnings is insulting to the intelligence of investors. No, Gilead’s blockbuster HCV franchise is no longer responsible for billions of dollars in new revenue each year. And no, Gilead has not completed its next game-changing acquisition. However, despite Harvoni’s rapid sales decline, its drugs Sovaldi, Truvada, and Viread are still performing well enough to keep Gilead’s total losses at a minimum. Analysts expect sales to decline 6% this year and 3% next year. That’s not too bad for a company with $30 billion in annual revenue. Advertisement Furthermore, Gilead may go through several years of mid-single-digit revenue losses, but with operating margins over 60%, it will still generate lots of cash and create shareholder value. Personally, I think GILD is the most attractive acquisition target in all of healthcare. But even if Gilead isn’t acquired, it can create long-term value from buybacks, future dividends and, of course, acquisitions of its own. AT&T AT&T Inc. (T) isn’t exactly beaten-up. In fact, it’s only 6% off its high and has soared at a whopping 19% this year alone. And it’s still a value! AT&T trades at just 15 times free cash flow with a nearly 5% dividend yield. You don’t find many opportunities like that in a market like this. Advertisement Dividend stocks in just about every other industry are overvalued. Consider that Procter & Gamble Co (PG), which yields just 3%, is trading at 21 times free cash flow. Further, many of the stocks that Wall Street considers top dividend plays continue to trade at multiyear highs — and many of those, like Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM), have real macro risks. See Also from InvestorPlace: 7 Dividend Stocks That Owe You More Money AT&T is a company with strong future earnings potential because of Mexico, Latin America, 5G and the Internet of Things. Its free cash flow is only going to grow larger. With its dividend costing less than $12 billion annually to maintain, that growth in free cash flow will continue to create long-term shareholder value. Apple It’s likely that no stock is more disrespected than Apple Inc. (AAPL). And it’s possible that no stock offers more short-term upside. Advertisement Apple currently is off 20% from its all-time high. That loss is largely tied to its expected 8% decline in overall revenue this year. At less than 12 times free cash flow, AAPL is poised to surge as the next generation of iPhones spark top-line growth over the next year. So while Apple’s 8% loss in 2016 has not been pleasant, it gives the company some favorable comps for 2017. Given that iPhone “s” units are always in less demand than next-generation iPhones, investors can assume that 2017 will showcase considerable year-over-year growth — likely far better than the 4% growth that analysts expect. That means a lot of potential rocket fuel for Apple shares. Kroger Grocery retail is a segment of the economy that performs well regardless of the market. Within that segment, Kroger Co. (KR) has been the leader. Kroger has grown identical supermarket sales for 50 consecutive quarters, and has stolen market share from the likes of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) while pushing smaller players like Whole Foods Market, Inc. (WFM) aside. Despite its very impressive past growth, Kroger is on pace for 5% growth in each of the next two years as it enters new businesses like specialty pharma and online/mobile grocery. If there is one company that should not be questioned, it is Kroger. Therefore, it is a bit odd that analysts see deflation and pricing pressure as a big risk for the grocery retailer. Yes, it is a concern, but if any company can weather the storm, it is Kroger. See Also from InvestorPlace: The 10 Best ETFs on the Planet There is simply no reason for KR to be trading 24% off its 52-week high. This is long-term value just waiting to be snapped up. Walgreens Boots Alliance Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA) is another stock with recent losses — it’s down 16% from its 52-week high — that I can’t explain. While some of the pressure is likely political, investors must realize that no matter what happens with the Affordable Care Act, no politician is going to rip healthcare away from the millions who are now insured thanks to Obamacare. Any change will be for future enrollees. With that said, WBA is the king of retail pharmacy here in the U.S., but it is quickly building end-to-end solutions for the entire pharmaceutical space. When it successfully acquired Boots, it gained pharmaceutical wholesale and with a 23.9% stake in AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC), it has distribution and sourcing incentives. After it absorbs Rite Aid Corporation (RAD), Walgreens will grow its retail presence, but the bigger catch may be the gain of EnvisionRX through RAD, a pharmacy benefit manager, to compete with CVS. In other words, Walgreens is a complete play on healthcare, and at 16 times free cash flow, WBA trades well below fair value. Bank of America Bank of America Corp. (BAC) has had a great month after rallying 11%. However, it still is down 10% from its 52-week high, and it still presents a good buying opportunity. Investors have been skeptical of big banks since the housing crisis, but now there are countless reasons to own BofA in particular. Not only has the company’s earnings been solid, but it recently passed its stress test. This gave BAC approval for a far more significant dividend and share repurchase plan. These developments are why BAC stock has recently surged higher, and will continue to do so. See Also from InvestorPlace: 7 Healthcare Dividend Stocks for Quality and Security While it is hard to predict the Fed’s action with interest rates, we all know the Fed wants to raise interest rates. No industry benefits more than banking, and no stock is better positioned or cheaper to gain from interest rate hikes than BofA. Collectively, it is a great time to own BAC. Dollar Tree Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR) has fallen 13% over the last month. The losses are in response to earnings that did not meet high expectations. Investors must realize that DLTR is not a quarter-to-quarter kind of business, but operates year-to-year with little regard for Wall Street and a long-term vision. What it accomplished with Dollar Tree retail stores before Family Dollar is simply incredible — to achieve a higher margin than any of its competitors with a $1 cap. I doubt any other retailer could be profitable with Dollar Tree’s business model. That’s why DLTR might ultimately be the best performing stock on this list 10 years from now as margins, revenue, and its stock multiple rises over time. Further, if Dollar Tree can earn the highest margins of its competitors with a $1 cap, including Walmart, then just think of what it can do without that cap in an equally large Family Dollar! It will take some time, and some growing pains, but history proves that DLTR will make all current investors who hold look like geniuses 10 years from now. This article is by Brian Nichols.

Photo: Ramesh Pathania/Mint As chief executive officer of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Sue Desmond-Hellmann leads the Foundation’s efforts to promote equity for all people around the world. This is her third visit to India and she is excited to meet with the India country office, which is led by Nachiket Mor. In an interview, she talks about the challenges in India, the partnership between the Indian government and the Foundation, how exciting it is to work with the Gates’s and her experience as a director on the board of directors at Facebook Inc., and Procter & Gamble. Edited excerpts: As head of the Gates Foundation what do you see as some of the biggest challenges in India? In India, our work started with HIV aids and that was tremendously positive. The other positive experience that the Foundation has had with collaboration is for polio that led to its eradication so the infectious diseases that are issues for people, especially poor people. HIV Aids is still a global issue but less so in India. The eradication of polio led to bigger aspirations but clearly our focus in India is on maternal neonatal and child health, nutrition, expansion into areas of agriculture, financial services for the poor, water sanitation and hygiene but our work is also focused on the two states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (UP) in particular, because 300 million people are there. So if we are focused on equity and making the biggest impact with our partners, Bihar and UP are the obvious places for us to go. What has been the Indian government’s stance towards the Gates Foundation? One of the reasons we are extremely committed to India are the two states of UP and Bihar, but the other reason we have been in India and continue to be in India is the very positive interaction with government. What we do as a Foundation is that we never pick sides, we are not political because government’s change. We are careful about following the law, we are apolitical. But its also practical for us because we know there are transitions to government so we push ourselves to always be prepared to be the people who bring the data, who care about equity, health problems and that has served us well. Our goal is that whoever is in government and is in the job, thinks of the Gates Foundation as experts who give inputs and wisdom that can help with the problems and that is a positive thing for us. We value our independence and stay above the fray of the government or politics not only in India but also in America where we are in the middle of elections. Staying above that is very important. You also talk a lot of precision medicine. How can this be used to solve health problems in India? I’ve challenged myself and my colleagues that if we are thinking about things like HIV Aids or Tuberculosis (TB) we need to know precisely where in India TB is the biggest problem. Let’s be more precise and more effective in making a diagnosis for TB, so we have been working, including with private providers, to make sure that they can recognize TB where it is and the most precise thing is to know where is the most resistant TB, the most serious, scary kind. The degree to which India will benefit with more precise effective diagnosis and therapy for TB outstrips what we could accomplish with the cancer story in the US. So the more precise we are with who is affected with the disease and how we can most effectively treat them minimizing side effects and minimizing costs, as an ambition is profoundly more positive especially in low resource areas. This precision is just a fancy way of saying let’s get smart because when resources are low, you have to make the best, most precise use of it. How is it like working with co-chairs Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett who is a trustee of the Foundation? It’s been great. They are all so different. The thing I love about working with Bill is that he is like a walking encyclopedia you can ask him anything and he’s thought about it read about it and remembered everything so one of the things I enjoy working with him is if I’m struggling with something, or I’m thinking about a problem, it’s really fun to think through with him because he has data, facts and history. What I love about Melinda is that she brings her passion about women and girls so directly to our work. I am a scientist so I ask about the statistics and the DNA but Melinda when she is thinking about the problems we are trying to solve will say what did that mom think, what did that mean to her, how will that affect her family, so she brings this incredible empathy and she’s also a mom so thinks in ways that are so empathetic to the human beings involved in the problems we are trying to solve that I am so inspired by what drives her passion which is that women and children have a better life in the future. And Warren is one of the funniest people I’ve worked with. Here is this hard hitting, tough Berkshire Hathaway businessman—but every time I am around him, I can’t stop smiling because he’s so funny. When we had our first annual employee meeting—he announced that he had made up a song just for me and he gets on the stage and sings for me. And I thought who in the world is so important and so special and does that, well Warren does. People use this funny word called ‘folksy’ I don’t know if you use that word in India. It’s kind of down to earth, humble and never forgetting your roots—Warren epitomizes that. He is just very folksy and funny. You are also on the board of Facebook and P&G, so how is that experience? I joined the board of Facebook more than three years ago and before I joined the board, I met Mark several times. At that time I was chancellor at the University of California, San Francisco, and I was fascinated about Facebook for medial reasons. I wanted to learn more about Facebook because I had learnt how important a social network is in behaviour change, and as an American physician I was really struggling with diseases like diabetes and obesity. I wanted to talk to Mark about this and how he thought about social network and behaviour change. We really enjoyed meeting each other and after a while I joined the board. And I’m delighted with the experience. Mark is a great leader, it’s extraordinary at such a young age how seriously he takes being a CEO and a leader, and I also enjoy being with Sheryl Sandberg who is such a great female leader. And it is such a big contrast to working as a director at Procter & Gamble that is 175 years old and all about consumer products. I wanted to learn at P&G about branding and marketing, something I don’t know much about, but I also learnt about integrity and company values, so both boards in their own ways have taught me a lot about management, leadership, about growth of a company, and cultures and I use those learnings everyday at the B&M Gates Foundation. What do you think have been some of the tangible achievements of the Gates Foundation in India? Making increments in maternal and infant health and survival has been extremely important, polio eradication in collaboration with others is another big, achievement and the third I’d mention is enormous progress in financial services for the poor what we call mobile money. There has been great progress, more to come but there is a lot of potential for people to get access to funds now.

Lee Jeans Introduces the Lee Woman and the Lee Man Denim Brand Returns to Can-Do Roots With GSD&M Campaign By Adrianne Pasquarelli. Published on September 06, 2016. Lee Jeans today debuts a brand refresh, complete with TV spots, a new website and a digital push as a way to reengage customers who may have been drifting away. The heroes of the new "Move Your Lee" ad platform are the Lee Man and the Lee Woman, who each appear in his and her own 30-second TV spot. The Lee Woman is "lean, mean and covered in jean," as she works as a physician, rides a motorcycle and takes care of her kids and husband. Similarly, the Lee Man likes to crash through boardroom walls and crushes having fun as he wears his "freedom pants." "We created this purpose, this life in motion," said Kim Yates, who joined the VF Corp.-owned brand as VP of marketing from Procter & Gamble last year. "There's this playfulness, an unpretentious nature of who we are that's always been there in the humorous way we approach the consumer and we wanted to bring that back." She noted that Lee's innovative fit, which includes stretch and cooling, wicking and warming properties in its jeans, allows its wearers to embrace a more active lifestyle. Interestingly, this "can-do" life was initially introduced by Lee's founder, Henry David Lee, who created the brand 127 years ago. "From an innovation standpoint, we're still in sync with our founder, but from a communication standpoint, we weren't," said Ms. Yates, who noted that most consumers only remember ads featuring the doll Buddy Lee, which first aired over 15 years ago. VF Corp. purchased Lee in 1969. The 30-second spots will also air in 15-second versions. A 45-second video will appear online that includes mini vignettes as well. Lee's new website debuted last week, and the brand is also rolling out new products for both men and women this fall. Omnicom's GSD&M handled creative duties, while Lee worked with Starcom on media and Hill & Knowlton Strategies on PR. Ms. Yates declined to say how much the Merriam, Kansas-based brand is spending on the effort. Last year, VF Corp. dedicated $19.8 million, or 19% of its total spending on measured media in the U.S., to Lee, according to Kantar Media. Though VF Corp. does not break down sales by label, its jeanswear division, which includes Lee, Wrangler and 7 For All Mankind, represents $3 billion of the conglomerate's $12.4 billion sales. Last week, Lee's sibling brand Wrangler unveiled its own new marketing campaign, which similarly highlights the adventure and boldness of wearing good denim.

She is a Pahara Aspen Fellow and a Ms. Foundation Public Voices Fellow through The OpEd Project. Don’t forget them this Labor Day—or ever Labor Day is not only a day off work for many Americans to acknowledge the contributions of millions of workers; it is also a day off from childcare for millions of American children and the educators who work to care for them. Although the earliest years are the time of greatest brain development, we have structured childcare as the responsibility—and burden—of individual families. Unlike our system of K-12 education, we don’t include early childhood education as part of our public investment framework. That neglect is in spite of the acknowledgment from many arenas of the importance of early childhood education. Police chiefs across the country have called for investment in early childhood education as a way to reduce crime, citing research demonstrating that children who have high-quality early learning experiences are five times less likely to engage in criminal behavior as adults. Mission Readiness, a consortium of retired military leaders, purports that early childhood education is essential to our national defense, by helping to a create a pool of better-prepared and qualified military recruits. Business leaders such as John Pepper, the former CEO of Proctor & Gamble, and Ben Bernanke, former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, have identified early childhood education as critical to developing the workforce of tomorrow. Yet despite the importance of their work, early childhood educators work long hours for low pay. The median income for childcare workers is just $20,320, less than hairdressers or janitors. Half of the nation’s early childhood educators live in poverty, scraping by with the help of federal benefits such as food stamps and Medicaid. African-American early childhood educators earn 84 cents for every dollar earned by their peers. To complicate matters, we call them “babysitters,” not educators. We ignore the training, care and attention that they bring to their work with children. As a result, the choice to engage in this profession can seem ill-advised. Because most early childhood educators are poorly paid, we tend to assume that their work lacks value. Because we assume that their work lacks value, we feel justified in paying them poorly. In the absence of a universal childcare system, this cycle is created by our assumption that childcare is a private good, and that families should shoulder the burden of care without public support. Yes, early childhood education is expensive; center-based childcare for an infant or toddler is more expensive than college tuition in most states. We have a model for investing in early childhood education as a public good: the United States Military. Our nation’s defenders have created a system for investing in childcare that is affordable, high-quality and accessible for military families. They provide quality training and oversight for childcare programs serving military families, subsidize up to 50% of the cost of care, and ensure adequate wages—$15 an hour, on average—for childcare workers. Major Latosha Floyd writes: ““The U.S. military has come to realize that providing reliable, high-quality child care for service members’ children is a key component of combat readiness.” It’s time to create a system of national investment comparable to what the military has. By Labor Day 2017, we can hope to have a plan in place for an early childhood education system that isn’t built on the backs of its workers. And one that does not forfeit the future for the children they teach. Tap to read full story TIME Ideas hosts the world's leading voices, providing commentary on events in news, society, and culture.

At 14:19 IST, the barometer index, the S&P BSE Sensex was up 291.73 points or 1.02% at 28,823.84. The Nifty 50 index was currently up 90.10 points or 1.02% at 8,899.75. Positive global stocks underpinned sentiment. The latest rally on the bourses was also triggered by outcome of a monthly survey showing that August saw a solid rebound in the rate of expansion in Indian service sector business activity. Domestic stocks saw a gap-up opening, as trading resumed after a local holiday yesterday, 5 September 2016. The Sensex hit its highest level in over 16-1/2 months. The Nifty hit 18-month high. The Sensex jumped 333.97 points or 1.17% at the day's high of 28,866.08 in mid-afternoon trade, its highest level since 16 April 2015. The barometer index rose 99.16 points or 0.35% at the day's low of 28,631.27 in opening trade. The Nifty surged 100.70 points or 1.14% at the day's high of 8,910.35 in mid-afternoon trade, its highest level since 5 March 2015. The index rose 38.80 points or 0.44% at the day's low of 8,848.45 in early trade. In overseas stock markets, European stock markets rose following gains in Asian equities. Asian shares gained as prospects for a US interest-rate increase this month remained subdued. Low US interest rates could support demand for emerging-market assets. Data on Friday, 2 September 2016 showed US employment growth slowed more than expected in August after two straight months of robust gains. US markets were closed yesterday, 5 September 2016 for Labour Day holiday. Meanwhile, the Group of 20 major economies (G20) wrapped up their annual summit, held in Hangzhou, China, yesterday, 5 September 2016 with a stronger commitment to coordinate policies to support growth and promote trade liberalization.

The UK throws away around 3bn disposable nappies a year, while in the US it’s approximately 20bn. Each can take hundreds of years to degrade. But now companies are developing new ways of reusing dirty nappies. Waste2Aromatics, a Dutch-led project from tech company Biorizon, is working with a consortium of companies to convert the virgin wood fibre from recycled nappies, supplied by UK nappy recycler Knowaste, and other absorbent hygiene products (AHPs) into bio-aromatics – raw materials for the chemical industry. “These products can be used in coatings, lubricants and performance plastics,” says Biorizon project manager Murk van Rooijen. “We hope to produce small amounts of these products in the next 18 months.” Plans are underway to commercialise the technology, starting with a pilot plant likely to be built in the Netherlands, which could be operational by 2019 Bio-aromatics could potentially replace traditional aromatics made from fossil fuels, if production can be scaled up. “We haven’t calculated the CO2 emission savings in detail yet, but expect to have these results in six months,” says van Rooijen. Knowaste’s UK managing director Paul Richardson says projects like Waste2Aromatics may represent the future of nappy recycling. Knowaste aims to recover around 18% of the UK’s AHP waste, including disposable nappies, by building five to seven specialist recycling facilities over the next five years. It’s ambitious, given that nappy recycling is still nascent in the UK. Currently Knowaste uses mostly commercial sources to collect AHP products, such as hospitals, nursing homes. The company is aiming to tap into the harder to access domestic stream, which Richardson estimates produces more than three times the amount of waste. While there are councils with dedicated nappy recycling schemes, these are few and far between. Knowaste was refused planning permission in July for a £15m nappy recycling plant in west London over potential odour problems. In 2013, Scottish nappy recycling trials involving Knowaste’s now-closed West Bromwich plant were deemed a success, but they have since ground to a halt with no plans to reinstate them. Despite this, Richardson remains optimistic. He says his company has developed products such as pet litter, waste containers and insulation material from the recovered fibre and plastic fractions of AHP waste. “The cat litter market for the UK and Europe is around 500,000 tonnes a year, and we would produce about 10,000 tonnes from one facility,” he says, adding that Knowaste has secured a wholesale deal for the cat litter, that would cover the output from two plants. Global nappy brands Pampers and Huggies are keen to be associated with similar end-of-life solutions. In Italy, Pampers manufacturer P&G has established Fater, a joint venture with AHP producer Angelini, to build a pilot plant capable of recycling 8,000 tonnes of disposable nappies each year, which are likely to come from kerbside collection schemes. Pampers’ spokesman Ioannis Hatzopoulos says the technology is still in pilot stage but the plastics generated by the facility could be turned into street benches, school desks and bottle tops. Two of P&G’s US manufacturing sites are converting pre-consumer nappy and baby wipe scrap into upholstery filling. Hatzopoulos says the plan is to roll this out across other sites. “We use nappy scrap to produce baby wipe containers in a closed-loop recycling programme. Last year, we also started using nappy scrap to generate fuel cubes used in cement plants locally for heating.” In New Zealand, Kimberly-Clark’s Huggies partnership with Envirocomp has composted over 19m nappies since 2008 to make soil for landscaping. Customers register with Envirocomp, pre-purchase compostable nappy bags and are then able to deposit used nappies at drop off points. More than NZ$850,000 (£467,000) has been invested in the initiative. “We’re working to create a more circular business model that allows us to recapture materials for reuse,” says Kimberly-Clark’s sustainability adviser, Ryan Kane. Kimberly-Clark is also repurposing leftover nappy scrap – its Huggies nappy mill in Sydney, Australia, is fitted with a specialist reclaim unit. Kane says any material that can’t be reused is sold on to local producers for horticultural and consumer goods, or processed into fuel pellets for cement factories. Startups like DYCLE and gDiapers are addressing nappy waste. DYCLE’s social enterprise model turns compostable nappy inserts into black soil – a fertile, synthetic soil – to grow fruit and nut trees. A pilot project ran in Berlin last year, involving a week’s supply of nappies from 20 babies. “One tree could produce 50kg of fruit every year,” says DYCLE founder, Ayumi Matsuzaka. “We want to keep the harvested fruit in the local communities. We could turn it into baby food, juice, jams and more.” Another way of dealing with the waste stream is to focus on nappy design. GDiapers, featuring an outer reusable pant with flushable or compostable inserts, says its nappies are growing in popularity – despite commanding a 10-15% premium over traditional disposables. “We see cost reductions possible in the near future,” says Jason Graham-Nye, co-founder of the Australian-based company. Due to “challenges with older plumbing”, Graham-Nye says gDiapers aren’t guaranteed to be flushable outside of Australia and North America. That said, Europe now accounts for nearly one-third of global sales of gDiapers, 50% of which are in the UK.

Clinton says she won't go to Mexico before Election Day World by The Associated Press Posted Sep 5, 2016 8:36 pm MST Last Updated Sep 5, 2016 at 9:40 pm MST WASHINGTON – The Latest on campaign 2016 (all times Eastern): 10 p.m. Hillary Clinton says she won’t be going to Mexico before Election Day. ABC News’ David Muir asked Clinton Monday if she would accept Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto’s invitation to visit, as Republican rival Donald Trump did last week. Clinton responded, “No.” The Democrat says she’s “going to continue to focus on what we’re doing to create jobs here at home.” At a rally earlier Monday in Cleveland, Clinton called Trump’s meeting with Pena Nieto “an embarrassing international incident.” ___ 8:30 p.m. Donald Trump is praising Phyllis Schlafly, the conservative activist who died Monday at 92, as “a patriot, a champion for women and a symbol of strength.” Trump says Schlafly was “a conservative icon who led millions to action, reshaped the conservative movement and fearlessly battled globalism and the ‘kingmakers’ on behalf of America’s workers and families.” Schlafly helped defeat the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s and founded the right-wing Eagle Forum. Trump says in a statement released Monday night, “She fought every day right to the end for America First.” Schlafly endorsed Trump at a rally in St. Louis in March, and she co-authored a book called “The Conservative Case for Trump” that is being released Tuesday. Trump says he was “honoured to spend time with her.” ___ 5:50 p.m. Hillary Clinton says the U.S. has shown “great restraint” to a series of cyberattacks by state and non-state actors. But Clinton told reporters travelling with her on her new campaign plane that “we are going to have to take those threats and attacks seriously.” The Democratic nominee said that a Russian attack on the U.S. election system is “almost unthinkable.” She said that Russian President Vladimir Putin appears “quite satisfied with himself” and the U.S. needs to “make clear that we’re not going to let anyone interfere with the decisions of the American people.” Clinton’s comments follow reports that the Russian government may have been involved in the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails just days before the party’s national convention. The emails, later revealed by WikiLeaks, showed that DNC officials had their finger on the scale favouring Clinton over her opponent Bernie Sanders. ___ 5:43 p.m. Hillary Clinton says she is concerned about “credible reports about Russian government interference in our elections.” “We are facing a very serious concern,” Clinton told reporters travelling with her to Illinois Monday, adding that the U.S. has never had a foreign power get involved in electoral system like the recent hacking of Democratic National Committee emails. She added that there has also never been a candidate who urges a country to hack more, alluding to comments made by her opponent Donald Trump who said in a July news conference: “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.” He later said he was being sarcastic. The Democratic nominee told reporters Monday that recent accusations that Russia is behind the DNC’s hacked emails “raises some grave questions about potential Russian interference with our electoral process.” ___ 4:35 p.m. Sen. Bernie Sanders is urging voters to remember that this election has never been about the people running for office, but about the voters. Campaigning on behalf of his former rival, Hillary Clinton, on Labor Day, Sanders told a crowd of supporters that the election is “about you and your needs and the needs of the American people.” For that reason, he said, Clinton is the best choice. Despite a handful of protesters with the die hard “Bernie or Bust” movement and supporters of Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Sanders’ speech largely stuck to the major points of intersection between himself and the Democratic nominee. He pointed how that both he and Clinton will fight for increased funding for sustainable and renewable energy, a higher minimum wage, a Supreme Court nominee who supports overturning Citizen’s United, and increased infrastructure spending in order to create more jobs. ___ 4:00 p.m. Hillary Clinton is calling Donald Trump’s trip to Mexico last week an “embarrassing international incident.” She said on Monday that Trump’s immigration speech in Arizona last week was one of his most “hate-filled, hard-line speech yet.” She suggested that he’s already set his position in stone when it comes to deporting everyone living in the country illegally, even as he continues to shift his language. Clinton said Trump would “double down” on his “absurd plan” to use a deportation force to round up people living here illegally. Trump told reporters Monday that immigrants living here illegally may not need to return to their countries of origin to obtain legal status. His position on what to do with people living in the United States illegally continues to be unclear. ___ 3:30 p.m. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are letting Ohio voters know they’re important while campaigning in Cleveland on Labor Day. Kaine, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, asked at crowd at a Labor Day festival Monday if they felt “battle-tested and ready for the home stretch.” Labor Day typically marks the final and most intense period of presidential campaigning. Ohio is a critical swing state. No Republican has won the White House without capturing the state in modern campaigns. He says Ohio voters know how to work the grassroots to win on Election Day. Clinton, meanwhile, said Ohioans know firsthand the importance of selecting a president, noting President Barack Obama’s bailout of the auto industry that saved jobs in the state. “I’m not taking anything for granted, that’s why we’re here today.” ___ 3:20 p.m. Hillary Clinton is having a rough start to her Labor Day rally, battling a stubborn cough. The Democratic nominee took the stage in Cleveland coughing uncontrollably, before turning it into a joke about her opponent, Donald Trump: “Every time I think about Trump I get allergic.” Several people in the crowd began shouting “get her some water.” She battled through the cough and delivered her speech with some difficulty. Both Clinton and Trump are in Ohio courting voters in this critical swing state. ___ 3:00 p.m. Former President Bill Clinton says the Clinton Foundation is doing good work around the world and says his wife’s political opponents are trying to distract voters from the issues by raising questions about the organization. Clinton spoke Monday to the annual AFL-CIO Labor Day picnic at the Coney Island amusement park near Cincinnati. Based on the records released so far, the AP found that more than half the people outside the government who met or spoke by telephone with Hillary Clinton during her tenure as a Cabinet secretary had given money — either personally or through companies or groups — to the Clinton Foundation. The AP’s analysis focused on people with private interests and excluded her meetings or calls with U.S. federal employees or foreign government representatives. Bill Clinton gave examples of Clinton Foundation partner projects, including with Cincinnati-based consumer products company Procter & Gamble Co. He says P&G’s clean water initiative has provided billions of water-purifying packets to help give safe drinking water in poor countries. He asked: “Is there something wrong with that?” ___ 1:25 p.m. Donald Trump’s immigration speech in Arizona last week may have gotten mixed reviews, but Trump says it was the “enthusiasm of the crowd” that inspired him. Speaking to reporters on his private plane in Ohio Monday, Trump said of his tough talk on immigration, “Some people loved it; A lot of people loved it.” The Republican nominee has come under heavy criticism for flip-flopping on the issue of immigration. Some Hispanic leaders who have been advising his campaign also said they feel betrayed after his long-awaited immigration speech that definitively ruled out a pathway to legal status for people living in the country illegally. Trump said Monday, “We had a very big crowd. It was unbelievably enthusiastic.” The speech was delivered on the heels of his visit to Mexico, where he held a joint press conference with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. The two said they discussed a number of issues on that visit, but not Trump’s controversial proposal to have Mexico pay for a border wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. ___ 1:20 p.m. Donald Trump says he plans to take part in all three presidential debates against rival Hillary Clinton. The Republican nominee was rumoured to be considering skipping at least one of the debates. But he told journalists aboard his private plan in Ohio on Monday that only something along the lines of a hurricane or natural disaster would keep him from participating. “I look forward to the debates,” Trump told reporters, saying he regards them as “an important element of what we’re doing.” As for preparation, Trump says he does not believe in doing mock debates, as is tradition for many candidates, saying, “I’ve seen people do so much prep work that when they get out there they can’t speak.” The first debate between the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees is scheduled to take place on Monday Sept. 26. ___ 1:20 p.m. Donald Trump has allowed a handful of journalists on his private airplane on the same day that his rival Hillary Clinton invited journalist to join her on her new campaign plane for the first time. Trump spoke with journalists Monday in Ohio before leaving his morning stop in Cleveland for Youngstown. The Cleveland Airport offered a glimpse of how critical the fight for Ohio has become in the lead-up to the general election, as airplanes for both party nominees and their running mates were parked on the tarmac Monday morning. Trump told reporters that he is open to inviting them on his plane more often. The billionaire businessman has repeatedly criticized Clinton for not holding a news conference since last year. ___ 1:00 p.m. Donald Trump’s campaign manager says there is a “very organized” effort underway to target Democrats in Ohio and beyond. Kellyanne Conway said Monday that “voters who traditionally have not voted Republican or haven’t even voted in a very long time seem to be coming out to support” Trump and his message. Trump was in Cleveland on Labor Day with Democratic Mayor Tom Coyne, of Brook Park, Ohio, who said he supported Trump in this spring’s Republican primary and would vote for him this fall. Conway said Coyne’s support for Trump is “just one example of what’s happening across this country.” ___ 12:25 p.m. Former President Bill Clinton is warning organized labour that Donald Trump’s economic policies would cause millions of Americans to lose their jobs. Clinton campaigned Monday for his wife, Hillary Clinton, at a United Auto Workers picnic in Detroit after walking in a Labor Day parade. He said that when the country last adopted Republican policies that cut taxes on the rich and raised the debt, “it didn’t work out too well for us.” Bill Clinton says his wife’s economic plan would create 10.5 million jobs while Trump’s would cut 3.5 million jobs. He is urging union members to support Hillary Clinton “because she has the best ideas.” He questions Trump’s leadership and says his visit last week to Mexico “damaged America in every serious country in the world.” He says Trump played nice only to return home “to dump on them” for his own political benefit. ___ 12:05 p.m. Donald Trump says he would have refused to meet with Chinese officials if they treated him like they treated President Barack Obama over the weekend. The Republican presidential highlighted the issue as he met with labour leaders Monday in suburban Cleveland. Trump noted that Obama couldn’t use his traditional staircase to exit Air Force One when he arrived in China over the weekend. The president used an alternative exit instead, something Trump described as “a metal staircase in the back of the plane.” Trump called it “a sign of such disrespect.” “If that were me,” Trump said, “I’d say, ‘You know what folks, I respect you a lot, let’s close the doors, let’s get out of here.'” Obama has downplayed the issue. ___ 11:55 a.m. Donald Trump says America’s manufacturing jobs are “going to hell.” The Republican presidential nominee blamed the Obama administration for allowing companies to move jobs to Mexico. He also lashed out at the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership as “a catastrophe.” The New York billionaire made the comments during a Monday round table discussion with labour leaders in suburban Cleveland. He’s spending Labor Day campaigning alongside running mate Mike Pence in battleground Ohio. The pair met with about a dozen current and retired union members, including teamsters, steelworkers, plumbers, police patrolmen and firefighters. Trump noted that he’s often best known for immigration, but he’s also focused on jobs and the economy. “We’re going to stop companies from leaving,” Trump vowed. He said it’s going to be “so easy.” ___ 9:55 a.m. Vice-President Joe Biden says there’s still work to be done to revive the American economy. Campaigning in Pittsburgh Monday alongside vice-presidential hopeful Tim Kaine, Biden told a crowd of union workers that the policies of President George W. Bush deeply hurt the economy and crippled job growth. He said the Obama administration “got the truck outta the ditch,” but that it’s still not going as fast as it could be. ___ 9:45 a.m. Vice-President Joe Biden is praising Tim Kaine, his possible successor, as a man who is highly qualified for the job and capable of handling any challenge that Hillary Clinton may throw his way. Biden joined Kaine in Pittsburgh for a Labor Day event Monday, where they addressed several hundred union workers. He said, “Hillary is really going to need him…because the plate is so full.” Biden said Kaine has more experience that any vice-presidential nominee in the past, something Democrats frequently say about Clinton in her quest for the presidency. He said he expects Clinton and Kaine to build a partnership similar to the one he’s built with President Barack Obama, if they are elected. Biden also described Kaine as a strong friend of organized labour, saying “no one has to tell Tim who built this country.” ___ 9:20 a.m. Tim Kaine is making Labor Day personal as he campaigns alongside Vice-President Joe Biden, the man he hopes to replace in the White House. Speaking to a crowd of several hundred in Pittsburgh Monday, Kaine shared the story of his father’s iron-welding business in Kansas City. He told supporters his father built a “partnership” with his employees, teaching Kaine and his brothers the value of shared prosperity. He said Democrats believe in management and unions working together, not against each other. Hillary Clinton’s father also ran a small business. Kaine said that as the children of business owners, both he and Clinton have a unique perspective toward the value of labour. He said, “We haven’t been sitting in an ivory tower.” Biden is also expected to speak at the Pittsburgh rally. ___ 8:00 a.m. Hillary Clinton is travelling aboard a new Boeing 737 campaign plane for the first time this Labor Day. Clinton was flying to events in Ohio and Illinois on Monday in a light blue-and-white campaign plane with her press corps. The plane has Clinton’s slogan “Stronger Together” on the side and her “H” logo on the tail. Clinton has travelled mostly by private jet during the campaign and has not held a formal news conference with journalists since December 2015 in Iowa. ___ 3:30 a.m. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are making competing Labor Day pitches in Ohio, setting the stage for a critical month in their testy presidential campaign. The Republican real estate mogul is joining running mate Mike Pence at a morning round-table discussion with union members in Cleveland. The Democratic nominee plans to arrive in the city for a Labor Day festival with union leaders and workers. Trump is also expected to campaign at a fair in Youngstown, Ohio, in a nod to the state’s role as a make-or-break proving ground for Republican presidential candidates.

Trump and Hillary Clinton are making competing Labor Day pitches in Ohio, setting the stage for a critical month in their testy presidential campaign. (Ross D. Franklin, File/Associated Press) By Associated Press September 6 WASHINGTON — The Latest on campaign 2016 (all times Eastern): 10 p.m. Hillary Clinton says she won’t be going to Mexico before Election Day. ABC News’ David Muir asked Clinton Monday if she would accept Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto’s invitation to visit, as Republican rival Donald Trump did last week. Clinton responded, “No.” Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said Donald Trump "choked" during his Aug. 31 meeting with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, at a rally in Hampton, Ill. on Sept. 5. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) The Democrat says she’s “going to continue to focus on what we’re doing to create jobs here at home.” At a rally earlier Monday in Cleveland, Clinton called Trump’s meeting with Pena Nieto “an embarrassing international incident.” ___ 8:30 p.m. Donald Trump is praising Phyllis Schlafly, the conservative activist who died Monday at 92, as “a patriot, a champion for women and a symbol of strength.” Trump says Schlafly was “a conservative icon who led millions to action, reshaped the conservative movement and fearlessly battled globalism and the ‘kingmakers’ on behalf of America’s workers and families.” Schlafly helped defeat the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s and founded the right-wing Eagle Forum. Trump says in a statement released Monday night, “She fought every day right to the end for America First.” Schlafly endorsed Trump at a rally in St. Louis in March, and she co-authored a book called “The Conservative Case for Trump” that is being released Tuesday. Trump says he was “honored to spend time with her.” ___ 5:50 p.m. Hillary Clinton says the U.S. has shown “great restraint” to a series of cyberattacks by state and non-state actors. But Clinton told reporters traveling with her on her new campaign plane that “we are going to have to take those threats and attacks seriously.” The Democratic nominee said that a Russian attack on the U.S. election system is “almost unthinkable.” She said that Russian President Vladimir Putin appears “quite satisfied with himself” and the U.S. needs to “make clear that we’re not going to let anyone interfere with the decisions of the American people.” Clinton’s comments follow reports that the Russian government may have been involved in the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails just days before the party’s national convention. The emails, later revealed by WikiLeaks, showed that DNC officials had their finger on the scale favoring Clinton over her opponent Bernie Sanders. ___ 5:43 p.m. Hillary Clinton says she is concerned about “credible reports about Russian government interference in our elections.” “We are facing a very serious concern,” Clinton told reporters traveling with her to Illinois Monday, adding that the U.S. has never had a foreign power get involved in electoral system like the recent hacking of Democratic National Committee emails. She added that there has also never been a candidate who urges a country to hack more, alluding to comments made by her opponent Donald Trump who said in a July news conference: “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.” He later said he was being sarcastic. The Democratic nominee told reporters Monday that recent accusations that Russia is behind the DNC’s hacked emails “raises some grave questions about potential Russian interference with our electoral process.” ___ 4:35 p.m. Sen. Bernie Sanders is urging voters to remember that this election has never been about the people running for office, but about the voters. Campaigning on behalf of his former rival, Hillary Clinton, on Labor Day, Sanders told a crowd of supporters that the election is “about you and your needs and the needs of the American people.” For that reason, he said, Clinton is the best choice. Despite a handful of protesters with the die hard “Bernie or Bust” movement and supporters of Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Sanders’ speech largely stuck to the major points of intersection between himself and the Democratic nominee. He pointed how that both he and Clinton will fight for increased funding for sustainable and renewable energy, a higher minimum wage, a Supreme Court nominee who supports overturning Citizen’s United, and increased infrastructure spending in order to create more jobs. ___ 4:00 p.m. Hillary Clinton is calling Donald Trump’s trip to Mexico last week an “embarrassing international incident.” She said on Monday that Trump’s immigration speech in Arizona last week was one of his most “hate-filled, hard-line speech yet.” She suggested that he’s already set his position in stone when it comes to deporting everyone living in the country illegally, even as he continues to shift his language. Clinton said Trump would “double down” on his “absurd plan” to use a deportation force to round up people living here illegally. Trump told reporters Monday that immigrants living here illegally may not need to return to their countries of origin to obtain legal status. His position on what to do with people living in the United States illegally continues to be unclear. ___ 3:30 p.m. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are letting Ohio voters know they’re important while campaigning in Cleveland on Labor Day. Kaine, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, asked at crowd at a Labor Day festival Monday if they felt “battle-tested and ready for the home stretch.” Labor Day typically marks the final and most intense period of presidential campaigning. Ohio is a critical swing state. No Republican has won the White House without capturing the state in modern campaigns. He says Ohio voters know how to work the grassroots to win on Election Day. Clinton, meanwhile, said Ohioans know firsthand the importance of selecting a president, noting President Barack Obama’s bailout of the auto industry that saved jobs in the state. “I’m not taking anything for granted, that’s why we’re here today.” ___ 3:20 p.m. Hillary Clinton is having a rough start to her Labor Day rally, battling a stubborn cough. The Democratic nominee took the stage in Cleveland coughing uncontrollably, before turning it into a joke about her opponent, Donald Trump: “Every time I think about Trump I get allergic.” Several people in the crowd began shouting “get her some water.” She battled through the cough and delivered her speech with some difficulty. Both Clinton and Trump are in Ohio courting voters in this critical swing state. ___ 3:00 p.m. Former President Bill Clinton says the Clinton Foundation is doing good work around the world and says his wife’s political opponents are trying to distract voters from the issues by raising questions about the organization. Clinton spoke Monday to the annual AFL-CIO Labor Day picnic at the Coney Island amusement park near Cincinnati. Based on the records released so far, the AP found that more than half the people outside the government who met or spoke by telephone with Hillary Clinton during her tenure as a Cabinet secretary had given money — either personally or through companies or groups — to the Clinton Foundation. The AP’s analysis focused on people with private interests and excluded her meetings or calls with U.S. federal employees or foreign government representatives. Bill Clinton gave examples of Clinton Foundation partner projects, including with Cincinnati-based consumer products company Procter & Gamble Co. He says P&G’s clean water initiative has provided billions of water-purifying packets to help give safe drinking water in poor countries. He asked: “Is there something wrong with that?” ___ 1:25 p.m. Donald Trump’s immigration speech in Arizona last week may have gotten mixed reviews, but Trump says it was the “enthusiasm of the crowd” that inspired him. Speaking to reporters on his private plane in Ohio Monday, Trump said of his tough talk on immigration, “Some people loved it; A lot of people loved it.” The Republican nominee has come under heavy criticism for flip-flopping on the issue of immigration. Some Hispanic leaders who have been advising his campaign also said they feel betrayed after his long-awaited immigration speech that definitively ruled out a pathway to legal status for people living in the country illegally. Trump said Monday, “We had a very big crowd. It was unbelievably enthusiastic.” The speech was delivered on the heels of his visit to Mexico, where he held a joint press conference with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. The two said they discussed a number of issues on that visit, but not Trump’s controversial proposal to have Mexico pay for a border wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. ___ 1:20 p.m. Donald Trump says he plans to take part in all three presidential debates against rival Hillary Clinton. The Republican nominee was rumored to be considering skipping at least one of the debates. But he told journalists aboard his private plan in Ohio on Monday that only something along the lines of a hurricane or natural disaster would keep him from participating. “I look forward to the debates,” Trump told reporters, saying he regards them as “an important element of what we’re doing.” As for preparation, Trump says he does not believe in doing mock debates, as is tradition for many candidates, saying, “I’ve seen people do so much prep work that when they get out there they can’t speak.” The first debate between the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees is scheduled to take place on Monday Sept. 26. ___ 1:20 p.m. Donald Trump has allowed a handful of journalists on his private airplane on the same day that his rival Hillary Clinton invited journalist to join her on her new campaign plane for the first time. Trump spoke with journalists Monday in Ohio before leaving his morning stop in Cleveland for Youngstown. The Cleveland Airport offered a glimpse of how critical the fight for Ohio has become in the lead-up to the general election, as airplanes for both party nominees and their running mates were parked on the tarmac Monday morning. Trump told reporters that he is open to inviting them on his plane more often. The billionaire businessman has repeatedly criticized Clinton for not holding a news conference since last year. ___ 1:00 p.m. Donald Trump’s campaign manager says there is a “very organized” effort underway to target Democrats in Ohio and beyond. Kellyanne Conway said Monday that “voters who traditionally have not voted Republican or haven’t even voted in a very long time seem to be coming out to support” Trump and his message. Trump was in Cleveland on Labor Day with Democratic Mayor Tom Coyne, of Brook Park, Ohio, who said he supported Trump in this spring’s Republican primary and would vote for him this fall. Conway said Coyne’s support for Trump is “just one example of what’s happening across this country.” ___ 12:25 p.m. Former President Bill Clinton is warning organized labor that Donald Trump’s economic policies would cause millions of Americans to lose their jobs. Clinton campaigned Monday for his wife, Hillary Clinton, at a United Auto Workers picnic in Detroit after walking in a Labor Day parade. He said that when the country last adopted Republican policies that cut taxes on the rich and raised the debt, “it didn’t work out too well for us.” Bill Clinton says his wife’s economic plan would create 10.5 million jobs while Trump’s would cut 3.5 million jobs. He is urging union members to support Hillary Clinton “because she has the best ideas.” He questions Trump’s leadership and says his visit last week to Mexico “damaged America in every serious country in the world.” He says Trump played nice only to return home “to dump on them” for his own political benefit. ___ 12:05 p.m. Donald Trump says he would have refused to meet with Chinese officials if they treated him like they treated President Barack Obama over the weekend. The Republican presidential highlighted the issue as he met with labor leaders Monday in suburban Cleveland. Trump noted that Obama couldn’t use his traditional staircase to exit Air Force One when he arrived in China over the weekend. The president used an alternative exit instead, something Trump described as “a metal staircase in the back of the plane.” Trump called it “a sign of such disrespect.” “If that were me,” Trump said, “I’d say, ‘You know what folks, I respect you a lot, let’s close the doors, let’s get out of here.’” Obama has downplayed the issue. ___ 11:55 a.m. Donald Trump says America’s manufacturing jobs are “going to hell.” The Republican presidential nominee blamed the Obama administration for allowing companies to move jobs to Mexico. He also lashed out at the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership as “a catastrophe.” The New York billionaire made the comments during a Monday round table discussion with labor leaders in suburban Cleveland. He’s spending Labor Day campaigning alongside running mate Mike Pence in battleground Ohio. The pair met with about a dozen current and retired union members, including teamsters, steelworkers, plumbers, police patrolmen and firefighters. Trump noted that he’s often best known for immigration, but he’s also focused on jobs and the economy. “We’re going to stop companies from leaving,” Trump vowed. He said it’s going to be “so easy.” ___ 9:55 a.m. Vice President Joe Biden says there’s still work to be done to revive the American economy. Campaigning in Pittsburgh Monday alongside vice presidential hopeful Tim Kaine, Biden told a crowd of union workers that the policies of President George W. Bush deeply hurt the economy and crippled job growth. He said the Obama administration “got the truck outta the ditch,” but that it’s still not going as fast as it could be. ___ 9:45 a.m. Vice President Joe Biden is praising Tim Kaine, his possible successor, as a man who is highly qualified for the job and capable of handling any challenge that Hillary Clinton may throw his way. Biden joined Kaine in Pittsburgh for a Labor Day event Monday, where they addressed several hundred union workers. He said, “Hillary is really going to need him...because the plate is so full.” Biden said Kaine has more experience that any vice presidential nominee in the past, something Democrats frequently say about Clinton in her quest for the presidency. He said he expects Clinton and Kaine to build a partnership similar to the one he’s built with President Barack Obama, if they are elected. Biden also described Kaine as a strong friend of organized labor, saying “no one has to tell Tim who built this country.” ___ 9:20 a.m. Tim Kaine is making Labor Day personal as he campaigns alongside Vice President Joe Biden, the man he hopes to replace in the White House. Speaking to a crowd of several hundred in Pittsburgh Monday, Kaine shared the story of his father’s iron-welding business in Kansas City. He told supporters his father built a “partnership” with his employees, teaching Kaine and his brothers the value of shared prosperity. He said Democrats believe in management and unions working together, not against each other. Hillary Clinton’s father also ran a small business. Kaine said that as the children of business owners, both he and Clinton have a unique perspective toward the value of labor. He said, “We haven’t been sitting in an ivory tower.” Biden is also expected to speak at the Pittsburgh rally. ___ 8:00 a.m. Hillary Clinton is traveling aboard a new Boeing 737 campaign plane for the first time this Labor Day. Clinton was flying to events in Ohio and Illinois on Monday in a light blue-and-white campaign plane with her press corps. The plane has Clinton’s slogan “Stronger Together” on the side and her “H’’ logo on the tail. Clinton has traveled mostly by private jet during the campaign and has not held a formal news conference with journalists since December 2015 in Iowa. ___ 3:30 a.m. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are making competing Labor Day pitches in Ohio, setting the stage for a critical month in their testy presidential campaign. The Republican real estate mogul is joining running mate Mike Pence at a morning round-table discussion with union members in Cleveland. The Democratic nominee plans to arrive in the city for a Labor Day festival with union leaders and workers. Trump is also expected to campaign at a fair in Youngstown, Ohio, in a nod to the state’s role as a make-or-break proving ground for Republican presidential candidates. Labor Day has traditionally been the kickoff to the fall campaign. Both Clinton and Trump have been locked in an intense back-and-forth throughout the summer. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

ASU researcher applauds federal rule on antibacterial soaps Gavin Maxwell, Cronkite News 3:59 p.m. MST September 7, 2016 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday issued its ruling on the safety and effectiveness of soaps and washes containing certain antibacterial chemicals. (Photo courtesy of Adriano Gadini via pixibay) (Photo: Adriana Gadini via Creative Commons) PHOENIX – Arizona State University researcher Rolf Halden has been warning the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of the dangers of ingredients found in antibacterial soaps for more than a decade. His research focuses on how man-made pollutants found in personal-care products seep into our natural resources and eventually, our bodies. He said the FDA has been slow to react to the recommendations of environmental scientists, but the agency has finally taken action. On Sept. 2, the FDA issued its ruling on the safety and effectiveness of soaps and washes containing certain antibacterial chemicals. The ruling effectively bans 19 chemical compounds from the popular over-the-counter products. Halden, the director of the Center for Environmental Security at the Biodesign Institute, called it a “public health victory.” “It took over 40 years,” Halden said. “I applaud the FDA for finally ruling on it and ignoring industry lobbying.” Harmful ingredients The FDA’s announcement states that companies can no longer market antibacterial washes containing these ingredients because manufacturers failed to demonstrate that the chemicals are safe for long-term daily use and more effective than regular soap and water in preventing illness. The FDA explained that some research shows long-term exposure to these ingredients, such as triclosan and triclocarban — the most common of the 19 chemicals used — can be harmful to public health. AZCENTRAL Food and Drug Administration bans sale of most antibacterial soap, saying it's pointless, potentially harmful Hand-wash products containing these chemicals go down drains and into water treatment plants, where a considerable amount ends up in our groundwater supply, according to Halden’s research. The chemicals re-enter homes in drinking and bath water. In 2004, Halden and a team of researchers discovered triclocarban pollution in metropolitan areas across the nation. “(Triclosan and triclocarban) are amongst the most abundant man-made pollutants. They are present everywhere, in our drinking water, urine, blood, breast milk and in newborns,” Halden said. The prevalence of these toxins across the U.S. is due to their popularity amongst manufacturers. They have been popular additives to products for more than 40 years. “Right now, the market consists of over 2,100 products and the vast majority of which do contain one of the 19 active ingredients,” said Andrea Fischer, a spokeswoman for the FDA. Cancer among risks  Potential health risks include bacterial resistance, hormonal imbalances and increased chance of cancer, according to Halden’s research. Fischer said the FDA’s ruling sends a message that the potential health consequences of these ingredients outweigh the benefits. However, some manufacturers claim these ingredients help to kill more bacteria than regular soap. These companies have not been able to produce enough scientific evidence to convince the FDA of their claims, Fischer said. Meanwhile, some manufacturers are ahead of the FDA’s new regulation. She said two major manufacturers, Proctor & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson, announced on their websites that they would phase out triclosan in their antibacterial products prior to Friday’s ruling. All manufacturers have one year to comply with the FDA’s new regulation. FDA officials said they hope the rule will curtail the level of toxins across the country. “I certainly can say we detect (the 19 chemicals) wherever we look, and that includes here in Arizona. This ruling will have a local effect in limiting pollutants,” Halden said. “This is something that we are going to monitor to see what the effect of the ban is.” For now, the FDA recommends keeping it simple and sticking to your old school soap and water. 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://azc.cc/2c8g9y8 TOP VIDEOS Zoo's gorilla barrier didn't meet standards when Harambe died 0:47 People formed a human ladder to rescue an man from a river in China 0:36 Marilyn Monroe's iconic dress sell for $4.8 million 1:05 Twitter expected to field offers to buy social media network this week 1:32 Black police group unhappy with political endorsements 0:32 Emu loose on I-10 in Arizona 0:12 First look: Sky Harbor Terminal 3 upgrades 1:23 Halloween 2016 By The Numbers 0:50 Octopus hunts one of the world's most venomous fish 0:35 Kent Somers, Bob McManaman discuss news from Cardinals camp on Friday 2:12 You Can Sleep In Dracula's Coffin Thanks To Airbnb 1:09 Five things that matter to Millennials in the election 1:52 Half-zebra, half-donkey is 100% adorable 0:27 Punchlines: Disenchanted yet? 4:54 Mexico City cartoon exhibit depicts Donald Trump as a Nazi 2:04 Former Jets player killed in crash 0:37 Glenn Beck praises Michelle Obama's speech as incredibly effective 1:15 4 dead when truck plunged off San Diego bridge into crowd below 0:43 What to watch for in Sprint Cup race at Kansas Speedway 1:56 Several women say Trump inappropriately touched them 0:50 Energy-saving tips 1:45 Sustainable building at ASU 2:10 Sedona house destroyed 1:36 Dad's heartfelt Facebook post inspires flood of support from strangers 0:54 Teen Marine surprises his mom after six months away 0:37 Accused school shooter charged with murder, attempted murder 4:29 A Phoenix resident is suing a Pappadeaux restaurant 0:49 Pottermore will tell you what your Patronus is 0:41 5 most memorable Ryder Cup moments 1:11 Trump campaign touts donation windfall after the debate 1:08 This beer is supposed to taste like a burger 1:02 The Republic editorial board's 2016 presidential endorsement 1:07 Pepe the Frog declared a hate symbol by Anti-Defamation League 0:30 More Stories Red table, blue table: Talking turkey at post-election Thanksgiving dinner Nov. 18, 2016, 6:02 a.m. Montini: Is Arpaio off the hook?

This research report titled 'Global Advertising Market 2016-2020' provides an in-depth analysis of the market in terms of revenue and emerging market trends. This market research report also includes an up to date analysis and forecasts for various market segments and all geographical regions. Social media advertising is on the rise, making it mandatory for major vendors to have a significant online presence. Engaging the customers and measuring the performance of an ad is easy on social media. Advertisers, thus, regularly monitor the performance of social media advertisements to justify the company's investment and request an additional budget for ad-spending.

The report categorizes the global advertising market into four major segments based on medium of advertising. They are: TV advertising Digital advertising Print advertising Out-of-home (OOH) advertising Ask an analyst: http://www.technavio.com/content/ask-analyst?report=53018 Have a question about this market? Ask Technavio's lead analysts a question and they will have your answer within 24 hours. Global TV advertising market The global TV advertising market is expected to reach USD 281 billion by 2020, growing at a CAGR of more than 4% during the forecast period. TV ads are the largest segment of the global ad spending market. They are the most viewed, influential, and favored advertising media in the world. TV advertising reaches mass audiences, and thus will continue to be the dominant advertising segment, despite the growing popularity of digital platforms. "One of the major trends in the market is TV ads with digital touch points. In this, the TV ads include the address of their digital presence in the content so that the viewers can know more about the campaign and product," says Ujjwal Doshi, a lead analyst at Technavio for publishing and advertising research. Including a digital touch point in the TV ad increases its effectiveness by 16%. With online purchases growing at a higher rate than in-store purchases, marketers see this as an opportunity to boost the effectiveness of TV commercials. Advertising is a premium source of revenue for TV broadcasters. TV channels need to increase their market share among viewers to attract companies to advertise on their channels. This is predominant in new TV channels who will have to engage their target audience before advertising revenue takes effect. Global digital advertising market The global digital advertising is expected to reach USD 280 billion by 2020, growing at a CAGR of close to 11% during the forecast period. Digital media is transforming the advertising industry. It is currently the fastest growing marketing technique, and will continue to grow during the forecast period. Earlier, only large corporations opted for digital marketing. However, many start-ups and SMEs have started adopting the digital marketing technique due to the affordability of the platforms. One of the prime factors for the growth of the market is that digital platforms allow user interaction. Moreover, the customer engagement rate and success of these digital campaigns are relatively higher than other marketing strategies. "Digital advertising campaigns also help to acquire new clients and customers. Posts and updates from companies on social media provide them with business insights and the latest news on product launches. Digital platforms like social media are, thus, rapidly becoming important venues for effectively engaging with the target audience," says Ujjwal. Digital advertising, however, is a long-term strategy. ROI can take anywhere between several months to a couple of years before a company benefits from the increased customer loyalty and sales. This factor also makes it difficult for the companies to quantify ROI or forecast profits. Global print advertising market The corporate sector has reduced their print ad spending, which has further resulted in newspaper companies facing budget constraints. Subscription and renewals too have dwindled significantly. However, print advertising does offer several advantages. One of the major advantages is that it sets a standard for advertising in the market. Print advertising holds a niche in the market as very few vendors can afford it. With region specific newspapers, print advertising can also target specific audience effectively. Advertising in newspapers and magazines require large investment of time, personnel, and money. The cost of a print ad can be significantly reduced if the same content is used in multiple advertising mediums. Ad-spend in the print media is rapidly declining. It accounts for approximately 21% of total advertising expenditure. As of 2015, the global print advertising was valued at close to USD 126 billion. It is expected to reach USD 135 billion by 2020, growing at a CAGR of more than 1% during the forecast period. Global OOH advertising market The global OOH advertising is expected to exceed USD 48 billion by 2020, growing at a CAGR of more than 4% during the forecast period. OOH is one of the oldest advertising mediums, which was deemed as inflexible because of its physical nature and its inability to hit the target. However, in the last 10 years, the medium has become more flexible with technological advances such as increasing adoption of digital outdoor advertising with the ability to interact and engage with customers. Among all the different types of advertising, OOH is the only medium which has complete reach over the target audience. With an increasing number of people spending more time out of their homes, OOH media delivers the brand's message continually across consumers of various demographics in their daily routine. One of the major factors influencing the effectiveness of an OOH advertising campaign is its placement. It varies from that of a billboard on the road to the placement of an ad during the break at Super Bowl stadium. Another challenge is the low amount of ad-spent on OOH media for the amount of time individuals spend outdoors. An individual is exposed to outdoor advertising nearly 24% of the time, but only about 7% of the total advertising expenditure is dedicated to this segment. However, during the forecast period, the disparity between time spent and ad-spend for outdoor advertising is expected to reduce.

Among the various regional markets, the market in Asia Pacific accounted for 41.0% volume share in 2015. In terms of value, the global baby diaper market is anticipated to expand at a CAGR of 4.1% during the forecast period and is expected to be valued at US$ 70.4 Bn by 2024 end. Among all product type segments in the baby diaper industry, disposable diapers are projected to be the fastest-growing segment over the forecast period (2016-2024). This segment accounts for approximately 49.0% of the global volume of diapers consumed; attributed to the availability of improved raw materials and technological advancements in markets in various regions across the globe. In Asia Pacific, disposable segment accounted for majority market share of 42.5% in 2015. Revenue contribution of this segment to the APEJ baby diaper market is expected to increase at a CAGR of 6.0% from 2016 to 2024. In North America, a market share of the cloth diaper segment is anticipated to fall from 11.2% in 2015 to 10.8% in 2024. This is due to the introduction of new baby diaper products with more efficient absorbency as compared to that of cloth diapers. In terms of value, the disposable segment in the Europe baby diaper market accounted for 49.4% share in 2015. Demand for baby diapers in countries in this region is primarily driven by increasing number of private labels and increasing the focus on raw material suppliers towards developing biodegradable materials. Download and View Report Table of Content, Figures, and Tables: http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/baby-diaper-market/toc Primary factors driving growth of the global baby diaper market include increasing promotion and advertising of various baby diaper brands and improved raw materials, and technological advancements. In addition, growing affluence and increased per capita spending on personal hygiene products and increasing birth rates in developing countries are other factors expected to drive growth of the global baby diaper market over the forecast period. Demand for baby diaper across the globe is growing steadily and can be attributed to the various associated benefits such as ensuring increased hygiene and low risk of skin damage. One of the major restraints for a growth of the global baby diaper market is a significantly slow rate of degradation of baby diapers. Diapers rank among the third-largest consumer item to be disposed of in landfills and represent 30% of non-biodegradable waste volumes. Moreover, disposable diapers contain dioxin, which is an extremely toxic by-product of the paper-bleaching process. This factor is anticipated to restrain the growth of the global baby diaper market over the forecast period.

Not doing so could mean a drop in stock prices, a decrease in revenue or worse — bankruptcy or even death. Just take a look at some of the brands that used to be on top but have taken a beating over the years (does the name “Blockbuster” sound familiar?). Fortunately, many of the prosperous and best brands you’ve grown to love have undergone transformations to reinvent themselves and secure your loyalty. Here’s a look at a handful of companies that maintained longevity and their bottom line by rebranding or reinventing themselves. 1. Netflix Today’s younger generation probably doesn’t remember that in the late ’90s to the early 2000s, “Netflix and chill” wasn’t as easy as firing up the laptop, logging into a Netflix account and picking a movie or TV show to binge watch. Instead, Netflix was kind of like an online Blockbuster, more or less. In 1998, Netflix launched the first DVD rental and sales site with Netflix.com. One year later, the company debuted its subscription service, which allowed movie buffs to rent unlimited DVD rentals for a low monthly cost and receive them by mail. It wasn’t until 2007 that Netflix transitioned into online streaming — and it was a smart move. Finally, viewers of all ages would have access to some of their favorite shows and movies, as well as original Netflix content. In fact, in 2013, Netflix nabbed 31 primetime Emmy nominations for its original shows like “House of Cards” and “Orange Is the New Black.” Although the company has received some angry outcries from customers over the years because of changes in pricing, the company has experienced financial success over the long term. For example, Netflix stock was trading at $3.80 at the beginning of 2007. On Sept. 1, 2016, the stock closed at $97.38. These days, it’s safe to say Netflix is considered one of the coolest stocks to invest in. And although the company didn’t grow its subscriber base as much as it wanted to in second-quarter 2016, Netflix did grow its members by 1.7 million. 2. IBM Sure, some might argue that investing in IBM would be a mistake because its revenue has fallen in previous quarters, reported NASDAQ in July. However, NASDAQ also reports the company is “amid a transformation process” and might actually be a good buy. And if there’s only one thing you’ll learn about IBM’s history, it’s that this company knows a thing or two about reinventing itself and keeping pace with ever-evolving technology. Since debuting as the Computing – Tabulating – Recording Company more than 100 years ago, IBM has undergone major transformations. Back then, C-T-R would manufacture and sell various machinery such as commercial scales, industrial time recorders, meat and cheese slicers, and more. And, it wasn’t until 1924 that C-T-R became the International Business Machines Corporation, although it has operated under the name since 1917 in Canada. Fast-forward a few decades to the ’50s and ’60s after Thomas J. Watson Jr. became CEO and “led IBM’s transformation from a medium-sized maker of tabulating equipment and typewriters into a computer industry leader,” according to IBM’s website. In 1964, the company created System/360, which essentially made it possible for machines in a product line to work with each other, making a huge impact in the business world. Less than 20 years later, in 1981, the IBM Personal Computer (IBM 5150) arrived. Although it wasn’t the first-ever PC, people began buying these computers to use in their daily lives. However, the ’80s and early ’90s were rough for the company. According to its website, “IBM was thrown into turmoil by back-to-back revolutions.” The company didn’t properly prepare for the PC revolution, reported NPR in 2011. With the focus on “desktop and personal productivity” instead of business applications, IBM suffered annual net losses that reached the billions — a record of $8 billion in 1993. The company had two options: reinvent or die. So, IBM shifted its focus to IT and consulting, according to NPR. Still, the company has plans to further reinvent itself. In her 2015 chairman’s letter, CEO Ginni Rometty wrote, “Today, IBM is much more than a ‘hardware, software, services’  company. IBM is now emerging as a cognitive solutions and cloud platform company.” Thanks to its transformation, IBM reported its analytics, cloud, mobile, social and security strategic imperative grew by 26 percent and contributed $29 billion in revenue in 2015. 3. Amazon More than 20 years ago, Amazon was a much different company. It’s hard to believe this go-to online retailer that sells everything you could possibly think of — from TVs and computers to groceries and household items — started off as an online book retailer. In 1995, CEO Jeff Bezos sold his first book on Amazon.com, which itself has changed drastically since the mid-90s. Back then, the website contained a lot of blue, hyperlinked text — quite different from the colorful photos and organized categories you’ll see on the site today. But Amazon’s design was practical; the company’s main mission was to sell books, after all. Author Brad Stone — who wrote the book “The Everything Store” about Amazon and Bezos — told NPR in 2013 he thinks Bezos started off selling books because it was “a good place to start: [Books are] small, they ship easily in the mail, the selection that the internet enables was a great strategic advantage over the traditional chain booksellers of the time like Barnes & Noble and Borders.” Indeed, buying books on Amazon was — and still is — easy and even preferable to going to a physical bookstore for many people. Although Amazon experienced success with its book-selling strategy, Bezos reinvented Amazon to sell more than just books. See: 10 Things You Didn’t Know Amazon Can Do for You In 1996, the retailer introduced an affiliate program — known as the Amazon Associates Program — which helped the company expand its reach, reports CBS News. And after announcing its IPO in 1997, Amazon introduced “one-click shopping” and began offering different products and services in various categories: music, DVD/video, home improvement, software, video games, gift ideas, kitchen, and so on. These days, the company is making big money. According to its second-quarter financial results report, net sales hit $30.4 billion — a 31 percent increase compared to second-quarter 2015. Forbes also named Amazon as one of the world’s most innovative companies of 2016. 4. Old Spice Old Spice is no longer associated with “old” or “colonial” men, thanks to successful rebranding attempts. The product — which debuted in 1937 as Early American Old Spice for women and then in 1938 as Old Spice for men — is now a popular men’s grooming brand. But it wasn’t always that way. After experiencing decades of success, Old Spice began to lose sales as competition increased and because it suffered from “an outdated brand image,” found a 2014 case study by the University of Southern California. In June 1990, Procter & Gamble — which owns tons of brands, from Pampers to Gillette — bought Old Spice from the Shulton Company. P&G attempted to rebrand the product, but it wasn’t until Old Spice launched its “Swagger” Campaign in 2008 that it started attracting the younger demographic it needed to compete with other brands, such as Axe, according to the study. Old Spice’s real moment of reinvention, however, came two years later. In 2010, former NFL player Isaiah Mustafa starred in Old Spice’s “The Man Your Man Could Smell Like” campaign. You might remember it: Standing in front of a running shower with nothing but a towel on, Mustafa tells female viewers, “Hello, ladies. Look at your man, now back to me. Now back at your man, now back to me. Sadly, he isn’t me,” and suggests that if their men switch to Old Spice, they could smell like him. When the ad debuted on YouTube during Super Bowl weekend, it became a viral hit. It was simply funny. According to an undated P&G fact sheet that addresses the initial campaign and its sequel “Smell Like a Man, Man,” Old Spice received a 2,700 percent increase in Twitter followers, an 800 percent increase in Facebook fan interaction, a 300 percent increase to the Old Spice website and around 105 million YouTube views. The campaign made an impact on sales as well, though the fact sheet didn’t provide any exact figures. AdWeek, however, reported in July 2010 that overall sales for Old Spice body wash products jumped 107 percent in the last month after two new TV spots and online response videos debuted.

McDonald’s In 2001, the book “Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal” released — and it didn’t have that many nice things to say about fast food giant McDonald’s. In a New York Times book review, Rob Walker wrote, “The aim of his book … is to force [the author’s] readers to stop and consider the consequences of McDonald’s and its ilk having become inescapable features of the American (and, increasingly, global) landscape — to contemplate ‘the dark side of the all-American meal.”’ Although it’s hard to tell if the book’s release directly — or indirectly — hurt McDonald’s reputation and brand in a monetary way, the Wall Street Journal did report in 2003 the restaurant posted its first quarterly loss in 38 years as a publicly traded company. However, the WSJ article said the closing of hundreds of restaurants, restructuring costs and other factors attributed to the huge loss. Nonetheless, McDonald’s food offerings have changed over the years to accommodate the healthy eater. McDonald’s currently offers plenty of healthy options, including salads, low-fat and fat-free milk, fruit and more. Plus, the fast food joint continues to make its nutritional facts available for everyone. No longer is McDonald’s only seen as the go-to place to grab a Big Mac loaded with 500-plus calories; its image is more health-conscious. In addition, McDonald’s has taken steps to reinvent the fast food world by offering “All Day Breakfast” and its McPick 2 menu. According to its second-quarter 2016 results, McDonald’s experienced its “fourth-consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales across all business segments.” And according to Forbes, the fast food giant has a market value of more than $100 billion. 6. Lego Lego has been around since 1932 and for years has been a hallmark toy in many children’s lives. At one point in 2014, Lego even became the top toy company in the world, surpassing Mattel’s Barbie doll, reported the Wall Street Journal at the time. But the Danish toy company wasn’t always a star performer. According to a 2015 Fast Company article titled “How Lego Became the Apple of Toys,” the company was reportedly on the brink of bankruptcy more than 10 years ago. The growth of video games and the internet threatened the toy company, which might’ve been considered as “old-fashioned” in the face of new, innovative toys and games, reports Fast Company. In reaction, Lego reportedly made a few mistakes. However, by cutting costs, improving processes and managing cash flow, the company was on its way to bouncing back. In 2011 came a Lego line called Lego Friends, which helps the brand appeal to young girls and combat the stereotype that only boys can play with the building blocks. But jump ahead to 2014, when “The Lego Movie” hit theaters. The movie and its products really helped Lego get the revenue boost it needed to overshadow Mattel in 2014, according to WSJ. Thanks to innovative products and a successful movie, Lego is now more than just a toy — it’s a cool franchise. According to BoxOfficeMojo, “The Lego Movie” film has grossed more than $460 million worldwide. And according to the company’s 2015 annual report, as reported by Bloomberg, net income reached 9.2 billion Danish kroner in 2015 — the equivalent of $1.34 billion and an increase of about 31 percent. 7. Apple It’s hard to imagine that in late the ’90s, Apple was on the verge of bankruptcy — but it was, reports Business Insider. Fortunately for the company, one of Apple’s biggest competitors — Microsoft — put on the Superman cape and rescued Apple from its collapse by forking over millions of dollars in 1997. According to Bloomberg, Microsoft’s $150 million investment helped Apple get the money it needed to change the technology space. In fact, it might be fair to say that thanks to Microsoft, Apple is now one of the world’s most valuable and innovative brands. After all, Forbes puts Apple’s brand value at $154.1 billion. In comparison, Apple was worth less than $3 billion when Microsoft invested in the company, reports Bloomberg. But give Apple some credit for its success; the company reinvented itself as more than just a Mac maker. Its handheld devices — from iPods to iPhones to iPads — have brought the company to an entirely new level. Apple’s ability to reinvent itself, and truly the product place, can easily explain why it’s consistently considered one of today’s best brands. Apple loyalists are always wondering, “What’s next?” Perhaps that’s why investors, including the famous Warren Buffett, continue to invest in this hot brand.

[steve p2008/Flickr] Print Comments2 DISCLAIMER: All opinions in this column reflect the views of the author(s), not of EurActiv.com PLC. Across Europe, consumers are choosing renewable electricity and are doing so on a large scale. It’s time to recognise this demand for renewable energy by reporting on national consumption, and not only production, of renewables, writes Jared Braslawsky. Jared Braslawsky is secretary-general of Renewable Energy Certificate System (RECS) International. He is a leading expert in the market for guarantees of origin and other electricity tracking instruments. He recently launched the International REC Standard Foundation, which implements and standardises attribute tracking systems around the globe. Dual reporting of renewable electricity can support consumer choice, showing the impact of collective action – and is in line with EU ambitions to empower consumers. According to the European Commission, citizens are at the core of the EU’s most ambitious energy strategy to date, the Energy Union. Today, there is legislation in place that requires national governments to report national figures of renewable energy production. Mandatory reporting of national consumption figures would ensure consumers are also part of the national statistics. This is the first step towards placing the energy consumer in the driver’s seat. If we expect the consumer to play a larger role in the energy transition we must also acknowledge their decision to purchase renewable electricity, and not only measure the production of renewables as we do now. Historically, electricity producers have been centralised, state-owned, top-down entities. The consumer had no choice of supplier, or of the source of their household electricity supply. The legacy of this traditional mode of energy production means that the energy sector is today the only sector where we are measuring the production – and not the consumption – of a commodity. Take electric vehicles for example: to measure real progress on the ground, we count how many electric vehicles are on the road in Norway, not how many are being produced in Germany. Across Europe, consumers are actively choosing renewable electricity and are doing so on a large scale. Last year European consumers made the conscious effort to purchase renewables for more than 550 TWh of electricity, equivalent to roughly 20% of all electricity consumption in Europe. If we include electricity that is not eligible for private consumption – such as German production that receives the feed-in tariff and is consumed equally by all German electricity end-users – nearly 770 TWh of citizen-led renewables was consumed in Europe. Many businesses are already voluntarily reporting their CO2 emissions from electricity usage as part of calculating their annual carbon footprint. One reporting agency alone, CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), had more than 5,500 companies voluntarily reporting their emissions in 2015 – accounting for nearly 17% of global emissions. Linked initiative RE100 supports companies in achieving a public goal to procure 100% of their electricity from renewable sources of energy, and includes global players such as Google, IKEA, Philips, Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble. The demand for renewable energy from these companies and millions of households around Europe is not currently recognised in any European statistics. Shouldn’t we recognise this positive choice for renewable energy in national reporting? CDP companies report CO2 emissions from electricity usage based upon a national/regional production mix (location-based accounting) and a company-specific consumption mix (market-based accounting), a method developed by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. This voluntary dual reporting ensures companies are responsible – for both where they consume electricity, but also, what market choices they make for their company’s electricity consumption. Dual reporting would be similar for national governments: report the national production of renewables and report the national consumption of renewables. Already member states measure national renewables production through the guarantee of origin (GO) instrument defined in the Renewable Energy Directive (Article 15). GOs are electronic certificates issued to renewable energy producers for every 1 MWh of energy produced. The electronic document is used to guarantee to the consumer that the energy delivered is produced from renewable sources. Once the energy is sold, the GO is then cancelled to avoid double counting. Collaboration over the last fifteen years between national regulators, market players, stakeholders and consumers has resulted in a robust and reliable GO system. The European market for renewable energy, documented with GOs, increased by 26.5% in 2014 compared to 2013. In 2014, the demand surpassed 300 TWh for certificates adherent to the European Energy Certificate System (EECS) standard, held by the Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB). This is nearly one tenth of all electricity demand in Europe (approximately 3,300 TWh) and one third of all electricity from renewable sources in Europe (approximately 900 TWh). In 2015, for the first time, an increase in cancellations of GOs, (and therefore of renewable energy demand) together with the decrease in issuing volumes, created a shortage of supply. This scarcity of supply marks a turning point in the development of guarantees of origin, setting the market in a good state for 2016 and the years to come. With limited exceptions, guarantees of origin are issued by members of the Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB) – mostly transmission system operators, electricity regulators and energy market operators. Measuring consumption of renewables based on GOs is therefore relatively simple to implement, and will highlight the increasing demand from consumers and businesses for renewable energy. The European Commission is currently preparing proposals for a new renewable energy directive (REDII) for the period 2020-2030, with a draft anticipated before the end of 2016. It’s not too late to include a dual reporting obligation in the new directive to support the citizens and businesses that are driving the European energy transition and show that collective action can make big changes.

Now we have a case that all consumers are paying this difference in the price. Also renewable electricity are extremely unreliable.

At 14:20 IST, the Sensex was up 25.85 points or 0.09% at 29,003.87. The Nifty was currently down 2.15 points or 0.02% at 8,940.85. The Sensex was currently trading a tad above the psychologically important 29,000 mark. The barometer index has alternately moved above and below that level in intraday trade so far. The market breadth indicating the overall health of the market was positive. On BSE, 1,436 shares rose and 1,174 shares declined. A total of 164 shares were unchanged. The BSE Mid-Cap index was currently up 0.11%. The BSE Small-Cap index was currently up 0.62%. Both these indices outperformed the Sensex. Meanwhile, data released by the stock exchanges showed that foreign funds made substantial purchases of Indian stocks yesterday, 6 September 2016. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought shares worth a net Rs 1438.72 crore yesterday, 6 September 2016, as per provisional data released by the stock exchanges. In overseas stock markets, European stocks were trading higher as investors digested weaker US data which lowered the chances of the US Federal Reserve hiking interest rates later this month. Asian stocks were trading on a mixed note. US stocks closed higher yesterday, 6 September 2016, after surprisingly weak US services sector activity data lowered the chances a Federal Reserve will hike rates this month. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) yesterday, 6 September 2016, said its non-manufacturing purchasing manager index (PMI) index fell to six-year low of 51.4 in August from 55.5 in July. FMCG stocks rose. Godrej Consumer Products (up 3.21%), Colgate-Palmolive (India) (up 1.47%), Britannia Industries (up 0.98%), GlaxoSmithkline Consumer Healthcare (up 0.39%), Marico (up 0.07%), Tata Global Beverages (up 0.88%), Jyothy Laboratories (up 0.93%), Bajaj Corp (up 0.86%) rose. Hindustan Unilever (down 0.72%), Dabur India (down 0.7%), Nestle India (down 0.96%), Procter & Gamble Hygiene and Health Care (down 0.66%) fell. Bharat Heavy Electricals (Bhel) surged on high volume after the company reported strong Q1 result during market hours today, 7 September 2016. The stock jumped 13.52% to Rs 157.05. Bhel's net profit surged 54.21% to Rs 77.77 crore on 20.84% growth in total income to Rs 5871.78 crore in Q1 June 2016 over Q1 June 2015. On BSE, so far 60.79 lakh shares were traded in the counter as against average daily volume of 8.03 lakh shares in the past one quarter. Bhel's order backlog stood at Rs 1.08 lakh crore as on 30 June 2016. Seperately, Bhel said that India Ratings and Research has downgraded its Long-Term Issuer rating to 'IND AA+' from 'IND AAA'. The announcement was made during trading hours today, 7 September 2016. Bhel said that India Ratings and Research has, simultaneously, removed all ratings from Rating Watch Negative (RWN) and a Negative Outlook has been assigned to all Long-term ratings. The removal of RWN follows the completion of the ongoing evaluation of Bhel's key business parameters. According to statement issued by India Ratings and Research, decline in Bhel's revenue for the period from FY 2013 to FY 2016, slow moving projects in the company's order book, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margins turning negative and high debtors days led to downgrade of the company's ratings. Telecom stocks were mixed. Bharti Airtel (down 0.84%), Idea Cellular (down 0.47%), Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) (down 0.5%) fell. Reliance Communications (up 1.72%) and MTNL (up 1.62%) rose.

Find out how addiction and substance abuse impact your community Health FDA bans soaps claiming to contain antibacterial properties Selima Hussain Washing your hands with soap and water is one of the best ways to stop the spread of germs. Privacy Policy You may want to think twice before buying soap that claims to kill 99.9 percent of bacteria. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration Friday banned soaps with certain “antibacterial” or “antimicrobial” properties, saying there is not enough proof to show the claims are actually true. The organization also barred companies from marketing soaps containing one or more of 19 active ingredients – most commonly, triclosan and triclocarbon. “Consumers may think antibacterial washes are more effective at preventing the spread of germs, but we have no scientific evidence that they are any better than plain soap and water,” Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. The FDA first proposed a rule back in 2013, after finding that long-term exposure to active ingredients in antibacterial soaps could lead to health problems such as bacterial resistance and hormonal issues. The agency prompted manufacturers to send data and clinical studies proving these antibacterial washes were significantly better than non-antibacterial washes in terms of reducing infection. In the three years following, the FDA received either no evidence or insufficient evidence to back up the health claims. Now, manufacturers will have one year to remove products marketed with these active ingredients. Some companies, like Proctor & Gamble, have already started removing the chemicals from soap products. The FDA’s rule doesn’t apply to hand sanitizer or wipes. When soap isn’t available, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend using sanitizer containing at least 60 percent alcohol to stop the spread of germs.   Sticking with good, old-fashioned soap and water, however, is one of the FDA’s main recommendations.    “Washing with plain soap and running water remains one of the most important steps consumers can take to avoid getting sick and to prevent spreading germs to others,” the statement said.

As Indonesia seeks ways to grow its economy, product exports are one way to build cash reserves, create jobs and lift more of its 250 million citizens out of poverty. But environmental groups say industries such as pulp, rubber and palm oil cause a bevy of challenges, from human rights abuses to environmental degradation. The result could be irreversible damage from deforestation that also threatens Indonesia’s most profitable sectors. Widespread fires, often lit to dry peatlands, are exacerbating this problem. It is easy for companies to say no to deforestation – the implementation of such plans, however, has often proven to become a difficult task. Greenpeace, one of the NGOs that says it is aggressively tackling this crisis, worked with other stakeholders to come up with a long-term solution to Indonesia’s growing deforestation problem. The environmental activist group worked with other nonprofits, consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies and Indonesia’s largest commodity producers to develop the High Carbon Stock Approach (HCS). The HCS Approach is a methodology incorporating a wide array of scientific data to identify the world’s most valuable forests. With its current focus on Indonesia, HCS Approach practitioners can identify forests that are highly valuable and therefore should be designated for protection. On the other hand, areas that may have degraded over time — and demonstrate low carbon or biodiversity values — can be primed for development in order to harvest commodity crops. The result is a tool for companies that are keen to enact change in their supply chains, but struggle to identify lands and companies with ties to deforestation. Companies can access HCS data to make sure they aren’t using raw materials, such as palm oil, that come from dubious sources. And despite its name, the HCS Approach is not just about carbon. HCS data can also give an idea about a forest’s biodiversity and vegetation density, as well as land-source planning and land rights tied to these regions. Companies that struggle with human rights abuses within their supply chains, for example, can tap into this data to ensure land use occurs within free, prior and informed consent protocols (FPIC) that grant local communities the right to vet companies and grant access to their ancestral lands. Supporters of the HCS Approach include companies against which Greenpeace has long campaigned. And they say the methodology is scientifically credible, transparent, and can halt species loss and land rights abuses. CPG companies involved with the HCS Approach include P&G and Unilever. They are joined by palm oil producers Wilmar, Musim Mas and Agropalma. Asia Pulp and Paper (APP) is one large Indonesian company that worked to develop the HCS Approach, along with Greenpeace, the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Rainforest Alliance. For APP, which is responsible for a supply chain that covers 2.6 million hectares (10,000 square miles), much of its involvement with the HCS Approach is about developing a legal framework. The company has held some of its concessions for nearly 30 years, but land rights cases can arise at any time, leaving the company and its suppliers scrambling to find solutions. HCS data offers a tool by which companies like APP can compromise with local communities while preventing wayward suppliers and contractors from harvesting forests illegally. This data can also help provide local governments, which usually lack the resources to enforce laws, with the information they need to prevent illegal logging and tree-felling. The threats to Indonesia’s forests are still daunting, but the HCS Approach is an example of how technology and “big data” can help solve this problem and allow stakeholders to work together. Aida Greenbury, managing director of Sustainability at APP, is cautiously optimistic, as she explained to an audience at this week’s IUCN Congress in Honolulu. “It might be a long shot,” she said, “but those of us in the private sector can use these resources we now have at hand to work with governments to protect these forests.” Image credit: Leon Kaye Disclosure: Asia Pulp and Paper (APP) is funding Leon Kaye’s trip to Hawaii to cover the IUCN Congress.

Kids will be signed up for soccer, gymnastics, instrument lessons, play dates, and academic enrichment work.  What most likely won’t be a highlight on kids’ harried calendars: enough time for healthy sleep. In 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics published, “Let them Sleep,” a report that recommended among other things delaying start times for middle and high school students to 8:30am, at the earliest.   Later start times would align the natural rhythms of children and adolescents, and hopefully afford them with 8.5-9.5 hours of necessary sleep.  Sleep deprivation among kids and adolescents increases risks associated with obesity, depression, cognitive performance and driving.  Sleep should be considered alongside nutrition. Would school boards ever approve of serving cheese fries, Twinkies, and Coke for lunch? That menu is essentially analogous to a 7am start time. It is downright unhealthy.   The scientific data are in, so why haven’t things changed? Because we live in a culture where sleep has been hyper-moralized.  Like obesity, addiction, and depression, the need for sleep is understood as a vicious moral weakness rather than what it actually is— a critical physiological process required for maintaining overall health and well-being. The need for sleep is highly stigmatized and sleep disorders often cluster around mental illness, obesity, and other ethically fraught health conditions. Historically, sleep has generally not been considered alongside other serious public health issues. In the US, sleep is generally considered to be a quotidian and habitual part of everyday life that wastes precious time.  Sleep apnea, for example, is a serious medical condition that has only recently been recognized by mainstream medicine and primary care providers.   Despite calls from the Institute of Medicine, very few medical schools include even a modest number of hours on sleep disorders in their curricula. This lack of physician training has led to over 40 million Americans undiagnosed, misdiagnosed, and untreated for sleep disorders. An attitude of indifference toward sleep health defines high performance jobs, where toughness, stamina, and grit are considered basic qualifications. In the presidential election, sleep deprivation has been cast as heroic, while a purported need for sleep is weak.  Branches of the military, for example, embrace an ethos of performance enhancement through controlled sleep deprivation. Pilots have long been issued amphetamines and modafinil –drugs used to allow soldiers to stay awake sometimes for days at a time.  It remains unclear what the long-term impact of sleep deprivation, modafinil and other anti-sleep interventions have had on the health of soldiers and veterans, but it is unlikely to be good.  Mental illnesses such as posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety are more common among veterans who have experienced disturbed sleep and report symptoms of insomnia and sleep deprivation. Similarly, the culture of medicine is anti-sleep. The structure of medical education is built upon a presumption that trainees will be sleep deprived for years, especially during residency.  It is true that things have improved as work hours have been reduced, but oftentimes, overworked residents are left with no other option than to fudge the numbers so that their training programs remain in compliance with the 2011 duty hour regulations put forth by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.  Work hour restrictions are mostly aimed at enhancing patient safety and overlook the health concerns of young doctors.  However, sleep schedules that result from periodic and often random night swings have been shown to have long-term adverse consequences. In traditional corporate settings, the idea of “nap rooms” seems ridiculous— to get ahead there is simply no time for sleep.  The Society for Human Resource Management found in 2013 that only 6% of companies had employee nap rooms.  Progressive businesses are recognizing the fact that they and their employees simply cannot afford sleep deprivation.    Companies like Google, Nike, Proctor and Gamble, and Huffington Post all provide the time and space for employees to nap.  Some even use “energy pods” – futuristic white capsules where employees can lay back and catch a power nap during the day.  These companies see the bottom line value in investing in well-rested and refreshed employees.   The economic impact of sleep deprivation is staggering.  A 2011 study found that insomnia costs the U.S. workforce $63.2 billion in productivity losses in a given year, not to mention increased health care spending from individuals with sleep loss. Sleep loss results in cognitive impairments, including deficits in attention, vigilance, and memory, and chronic sleep deprivation is associated with poorer mental health status, resulting in depression and anxiety. Poverty and sleep deprivation are also connected.  A 2011 study by Patel and others found that sleep health was significantly reduced in the poor.  It is difficult to determine causation: does poverty mediate poor sleep quality, or does poor sleep quality lead to poverty? Probably both.  Regardless, it is clear that without intervention, sleep deprivation has an enormous impact on one’s health, well-being, and ability to successfully build a stable life above the poverty line. Despite the facts, sleep is still viewed as a luxury or a sign of laziness rather than being akin to potable water and nutrition— the basic public health necessity that it truly is.    While there has been some progress, there is still a long way to go to elevate the importance of sleep in both policy and practice. In the 1990’s, smoking bans seemed novel, but now smoke free public spaces are normal.  That process required a slow but steady effort to change the public’s attitude. Likewise, attitudes about sleep must be transformed through education and public policies that encourage healthy sleep.   But to make real headway in rationalizing our nation’s attitude toward sleep, we need to start with our kids.  Let’s not continue to subject them to the insidiously destructive structure of ridiculously early school start times.    It is time to think creatively about providing the necessary hours of sleep to our kids, to provide them with immediate benefits and to engender healthy sleep habits for adulthood.  Dominic Sisti is Director of the Scattergood Program for Applied Ethics of Behavioral Health Care and Assistant Professor of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at Penn.

DDB Mudra's campaign for Indian food brand Nutralite leveraged the popularity of Ganesh, incentivising people to eat more healthily, while Leo Burnett India's work for Bajaj Motorcycles honed in on Indians' sense of national pride. Multinationals such as Nestlé, Mars, P&G, Lego, Vodafone, Amazon and Unilever are well represented, alongside non-profits such as Make Love Not Scars, Love Yourself and The Akanksha Foundation, which was also shortlisted for the Warc Prize for Social Strategy and was featured in the 2016 Warc 100. “This year's shortlist demonstrates the very best in smart strategic thinking delivering awesome business results," said Sanjeeb Chaudhuri, global head of brand and chief marketing officer, Standard Chartered Bank and chair of the judging panel. “The wide range of brands, categories and markets represented is a fitting testament to the reputation within the industry that the Warc Prize for Asian Strategy has built since its inception in 2011," he added.

Sign up for The Power Lunch: Florida Politics newsletter - our must-read, weekday roundup of Florida political news and buzz >> Health FDA bans soaps claiming to contain antibacterial properties Selima Hussain Washing your hands with soap and water is one of the best ways to stop the spread of germs. Privacy Policy You may want to think twice before buying soap that claims to kill 99.9 percent of bacteria. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration Friday banned soaps with certain “antibacterial” or “antimicrobial” properties, saying there is not enough proof to show the claims are actually true. The organization also barred companies from marketing soaps containing one or more of 19 active ingredients – most commonly, triclosan and triclocarbon. “Consumers may think antibacterial washes are more effective at preventing the spread of germs, but we have no scientific evidence that they are any better than plain soap and water,” Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. The FDA first proposed a rule back in 2013, after finding that long-term exposure to active ingredients in antibacterial soaps could lead to health problems such as bacterial resistance and hormonal issues. The agency prompted manufacturers to send data and clinical studies proving these antibacterial washes were significantly better than non-antibacterial washes in terms of reducing infection. In the three years following, the FDA received either no evidence or insufficient evidence to back up the health claims. Now, manufacturers will have one year to remove products marketed with these active ingredients. Some companies, like Proctor & Gamble, have already started removing the chemicals from soap products. The FDA’s rule doesn’t apply to hand sanitizer or wipes. When soap isn’t available, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend using sanitizer containing at least 60 percent alcohol to stop the spread of germs.   Sticking with good, old-fashioned soap and water, however, is one of the FDA’s main recommendations.    “Washing with plain soap and running water remains one of the most important steps consumers can take to avoid getting sick and to prevent spreading germs to others,” the statement said.

(*this news item will not be available after 12/01/2016) Friday, September 2, 2016 FRIDAY, Sept. 2, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is banning most antibacterial soaps and body washes currently on store shelves, arguing that the products create potential health risks but don't perform any better than plain old soap and water. The ban covers soaps and body washes containing triclosan and triclocarban, the two most common antibacterial ingredients, the FDA says. Another 17 active ingredients also are included in the ban. "Most consumer wash products labeled 'antibacterial' or 'antimicrobial' contain at least one of the antibacterial ingredients addressed in this final rule," said Dr. Theresa Michele, director of the Division of Nonprescription Drug Products at the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. There are more than 2,100 antibacterial soaps sold today, representing about 40 percent of the overall soap market, Michele said during a media briefing Friday. The agency said it took this action over concerns that antibacterial soaps might be contributing to bacterial resistance. In the United States, at least 2 million people a year become infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and at least 23,000 die from these infections, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The FDA also noted other health concerns related to long-term use of the now-banned active ingredients. For example, recent studies have shown that triclosan can affect the thyroid, estrogen and testosterone systems of mammals, which could have implications for human health, the agency reported in its final rule. At the same time, manufacturers failed to show that their antibacterial products are any better than ordinary soap and water at preventing the spread of germs, the FDA said. People should remain diligent about washing their hands with regular soap and water "to avoid getting sick and prevent the spread of germs, especially during the start of the school year," Michele said. The new ban does not cover hand sanitizer gels or wipes, which are not used with water and often contain alcohol as the active ingredient. It also does not cover antiseptics used in health care settings, the FDA said. If soap and water aren't available, the CDC recommends that people use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60 percent alcohol. Manufacturers have one year to comply with the ban, although the FDA noted that many have already started phasing out triclosan, triclocarban and other active ingredients. Both Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson announced prior to the ban that they are phasing out triclosan, Michele said. The FDA estimates that this ban will reduce Americans' exposure to these active ingredients by 2.2 million pounds per year. Triclosan is most often included in liquid soap, while triclocarban is found in bar soaps, Michele said. The ban first was proposed by the FDA in 2013. At that time, the agency required manufacturers to provide additional data on the safety and effectiveness of the active ingredients in their antibacterial soaps, if they wanted to keep those products on the market. In terms of effectiveness, the manufacturers had to prove to the FDA that antibacterial soaps worked better than plain soap and water at preventing the spread of germs or reducing infections. The FDA is deferring the proposed ban one year for three other ingredients used in consumer wash products, based on promises from industry to provide more evidence, Michele said. Antibacterial soaps containing benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride and chloroxylenol will remain on the market while manufacturers develop additional safety and effectiveness data for these ingredients, she said.

The report forecasts the global online beauty and personal care market to grow at a CAGR of 16.70% during the period 2016-2020. The report has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs from industry experts. The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects over the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market. Rise in demand for dermocosmetic products will be a key trend for market growth. Dermocosmetics are products that combine cosmetic action with dermatological functions. It is a branch of dermatology concerned with the aesthetic appearance of the skin. The segment has doubled in the last 15 years, from 2.2% to 4.4% of the global beauty market. Western Europe represents almost 60% of the dermocosmetics market. Currently, France is the market leader in terms of revenue, followed by Italy, Germany, and Spain. Worldwide demand for dermocosmetic products has grown in the last five years. According to the report, one of the key drivers for market growth will be high rate of internet and smartphone penetration and increase in online spending. As of 2014, the internet penetration rate (percentage-to-population) in the US was 87.4%. Approximately 279 million people in the US were internet users; this number is the third-largest globally, after China and India. Users in the US spend more time online per capita than other users globally. An average US internet user spends more than 90 hours online per week, which is almost five times the global average. Also, broadband penetration in the country has increased recently with the growth of both fixed and wireless broadband connections. This high amount of time spent by US consumers online is encouraging beauty and personal care marketers to expand their product offerings through digital platforms. Further, the report states that increasing webrooming will be a challenge for the market.

However, there is an adage, too, that mid-caps have always been about bottom fishing. If one can pick good stocks, which can transform into large-caps, the returns can be exciting. Here are 10 mid-cap stocks which reported a decent set of earnings in FY16 and continued to do so in the June quarter, or Q1 of FY17. These had revenue and net profit growth of 11 per cent to 40 per cent in FY16, compared to the eight per cent average revenue and profit growth of companies constituting the S&P BSE Midcap index. Importantly, they are also expected to do well over the next two years. Click here for details about these 10 stocks Although the valuations for some of these (Page Industries, Procter & Gamble, Bajaj Finance) companies are high as has been the case historically, it is largely due to their high earnings growth visibility. Unless these companies falter on growth or external and domestic factors play spoilsport, analysts expect them to do well.

Sport Other Sports Rio Paralympics 2016: Captaining Team GB will be pinnacle after a punch ended my Premier dream, says Jack Rutter Matt Watts Wednesday 7 September 2016 09:29 BST Battling back: Jack Rutter kickstarting the P&G Sainsbury's campaign to raise money for the British Paralympic Association Paralympic footballer Jack Rutter today said captaining Team GB's Cerebral Palsy side would be the pinnacle of a seven-year battle back to the top of the game after an assault wrecked his dreams of becoming a professional. The 25-year-old said leading the seven-a-side team out in the opener against Brazil at the Paralympic Games in Rio would be the proudest moment of his career.  In 2009 Rutter, then 18, was punched during a night out in Gloucester in an unprovoked attack which left him with brain damage and deaf in one ear.  It happened a month before he was due to be given a professional contract by then Premier League club Birmingham City, wrecking his future. The midfielder said he then went through the "darkest times" of his life as he dropped to the bottom tiers of non-league football as his injuries stopped him being the player he once was. But Rutter said he was inspired after being offered a route back through Cerebral Palsy football.  Having seen the Team GB side play at London 2012 he was called by the head of disability football at the FA, Jeff Davies, who told him he had heard his story and he could have a trial. Rutter became England captain and played at the world championships but the Paralympic Games were his ultimate focus.  He told the Standard: "Captaining the team at the Paralympics will easily be the proudest moment of my career. "I feel like the adversity and pain I suffered during those dark times is the strength I feel now.  To go out and captain Great Britain in the first game, the opening game against Brazil, will put all that bad stuff to bed and that for me will be the best feeling in the world." Rutter, who plays for Lydney Town in the ninth tier of English football, said he hoped his story would be an inspiration to others who face adversity.  He spoke as he kick-started a campaign which will see donations from P&G products sold at Sainsbury's help raise money for the British Paralympic Association.  One P&G product will equal one donation until September 20.

Sport Other Sports Rio Paralympics 2016: Anne Dickins: I beat seasickness to become a paracanoeist Athlete tells of therapy journey to prepare for contest in Rio  Matt Watts Wednesday 7 September 2016 09:21 BST Contender: Paralympics GB athlete Anne Dickins Paracanoeist Anne Dickins today told of her journey from a lifelong avoidance of boats due to severe seasickness to going for gold in Rio. The 47-year-old former endurance cyclist will be favourite for the KL3 200m race in Brazil in the culmination of an incredible journey after injury ended her career on a bike. During a break in a 24-hour race in 2011, the athlete laid down with her pump and multi-tool still in her back pocket. She ruptured a disc in her back and injured nerves in her leg which left her disabled and forced her to give up cycling. A chance meeting with a GB paracanoe coach while volunteering at London 2012 saw her invited to try out for the sport. Since then she has won both European and world titles. But one of her main fears about finding a new career in a canoe was her severe seasickness which saw her avoid boats her whole life. She told the Standard she had a desensitisation programme normally saved for fighter pilots to cure motion sickness: "I had lots of specialists, lots of investigations, lots of treatments. Before I started this journey to Rio I'd never been in a canoe. But this was all part of the challenge I wanted." She said of becoming a Paralympic athlete: "If I can inspire someone to take up a sport, that's what it's all about." Ms Dickins spoke as she took part in a campaign which sees donations from P&G products sold at Sainsbury's to help fund British Paralympic Association athletes. One product = one donation, until September 20. See stores for details.
