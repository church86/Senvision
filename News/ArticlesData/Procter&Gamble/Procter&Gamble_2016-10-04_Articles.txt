Photo: Abhishek B.A./Mint Bengaluru: In 1999, British entrepreneur Kevin Ashton coined the term ‘Internet of Things’ while he was working at Procter & Gamble. Around that time, he made a presentation on putting sensors in everyday objects that would be powered by the Internet. Shortly afterwards, he co-founded a research centre in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology called the Auto-ID Centre. Since then, Ashton founded three more companies in IoT. In an interview on the sidelines of the Nasscom Engineering Summit on Wednesday on IoT’s evolution and challenges. On a lighter note, when asked about the US presidential elections, Ashton said emphatically, “Trump won’t win. He doesn’t stand a chance.” Edited excerpts: It’s been 17 years since you coined the term ‘Internet of Things.’ However, overall results in terms of scaling up have been mixed. Is IoT facing a mid-life crisis of sorts? I think I am! (laughs) No—the very interesting thing that you see about the Internet of Things is…when it works, it’s kind of invisible. Like all good technology. Just as a simple example, if you look at the rise of the smartphone, one of the funny things about smartphone is that it’s got the word ‘phone’ in it today — because it’s not what it is. It’s not a phone. Phone is an app that sometimes you use — so, what is a smartphone? Some say it’s a pocket-sized computer. But that’s not really it either. At least not how I look at it because a typical smartphone today has as many as 10 network sensors. That’s twice as many as a human being. So it’s a very sentient platform—and the obvious sensors are for example, cameras, microphones, etc. But your smartphone knows where it is even when you don’t. It measures things like barometric pressure—many of them can detect your heartbeat or fingerprint or your moving. The vision of the Internet of Things is network sensors. Also Read: Indian IoT market to touch $15 billion by 2020: Nasscom And the smartphone is just a visible example of a network sensor platform—the irony is that just because it’s called a phone nobody seems to realise it. My view is that we’re 15 years into a 100-year roll-out. So, I think if there’s any sort of crisis to IoT, it’ll be a teenage sort of crisis… we’re still in a very early growth phase—I don’t think we’ve grown up yet. IoT deployments are moving at a much slower pace than was originally hoped. In many organisations, it’s still at a proof of concept stage. Why is the IoT facing challenges in scaling up? It’s a software challenge that you have right now. We got very good at gathering sensor data. Sensors have become very cheap, networking has become very cheap—the new challenge is how to automatically process that data. In the 20th century, you got some data and you put it on a spreadsheet and everybody looked at the spreadsheet. In the 21st century, the machine looks at the data and figures out what’s important and what to do with the data. There’s some complexity there—technological machine learning is getting better all the time, but that’s the limit right now. What are the futuristic applications of IoT that seem like science fiction now? The technology points to what you call autonomous automation. So, we think of automation right now, we think of giving machine a task, it executes a task, it stops. What will happen in the Internet of Things age is that’s the back-loop that’ll keep turning. The machine will change something in the world somehow, they will then sense that change and then figure out what to do next with that change. Any examples that you can think of? The easy one is self-driving cars. That’s coming very quickly everywhere... So this sort of continuous autonomous automation which will start with self-driving cars, I think that technology will start applying itself in the home where you’ll see things like more sophisticated vacuum cleaners, things like laundering which today is barely automatic—that’s the kind of stuff that you’re going to see. Continuous autonomous automation. How does India compare with the tech boom that you saw in the US? The first time I came to India I came as a student and I got a tourist railway pass. I was in Bombay and then I travelled around the country kind of in a clockwise direction. I always told my Indian friends that I’ve seen more of India than they have. Because of the direction of travel, Bangalore was one of the last places I came to and the contrast between Bangalore and what was Calcutta back then and Delhi and Bombay was very striking. And so, it’s always amazing to come back here and remember what it was like. And that’s representative of the changes around the world. Which is the age of United States as a world technology leader is really over—which is very surprising to Americans because they talk about Facebook or Google. But if you look at what’s been going on in the market, US tech exports is sort of flat to declining and then you have Asian nations particularly China, Korea, Singapore and India that are on the rise. And what’s fuelling that is very interesting to think about when you’re in Bangalore — which is what drove America to technological excellence in the 20th century was the establishment of some major technology universities between 1900 and 1950 and then significant government investment in science and research and development between 1950 and 1970. And those investments laid the foundation for, take for example, all the tech companies of the dotcom boom, and we’re seeing the end of that tail now with Google and Facebook. Now if you look at what’s happened in Asia, you basically see the same path only a little later. There’s an investment in education in technology, followed by government investment in pure science and R&D which is inevitably followed by an expansive technology sector that is supposed to be disruptive to more mature tech economies. If you think of India with that pattern in mind, you have IITs everywhere, which in the 20th century exported its undergraduates to places like MIT but now they are coming back….What you see in India is also an amazing space program right here in Bangalore, increasing investment in defence and development. And what that is inevitably leading to is India becoming not just an offshore-outsource subsidiary centre of technology, but also a leading exporter of high technology and leading user of high technology. I expect that we really are at the beginning of the Indian technology revolution…They’re going to form amazing technology companies and they’ll do it in areas like the Internet of Things which is new and disruptive…It’s great to come here and talk about the Internet of Things because my expectation is that 5-10 years from now, India will be one of the top three IoT tech exporters in the world. You’ll be competing with China and possibly South Korea.

The Mom Project matches employers with women seeking challenging but flexible assignments that keep them in the game. Zara Kessler ZaraKessler October 5, 2016 — 11:07 AM EDT Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Allison Robinson looks young for a mom, let alone a chief executive officer. But, days from turning 30, she’s both—the mother of a 14-month-old son and an even younger company, the Mom Project, which matches women who want flexible work with employers who want them. Robinson had been at Procter & Gamble since college, most recently working on the Pampers brand as a senior account executive for the North America baby-care market and strategy team. While on maternity leave, she read about the many highly qualified mothers who leave their jobs. Returning to work after a leave can be difficult, and women’s earning power can take a hit. “I felt like the decision of being a full-time career mom or a stay-at-home mom was too binary, and I wanted to create a solution in between, that allowed moms to stay professionally engaged through rewarding, challenging work to keep their skill sets current,” said Robinson, who lives in Chicago with her husband, Gregory, a business operator at a private equity firm, and their son, Asher. Allison Robinson Source: The Mom Project Robinson never went back to P&G. In early April, she launched her “digital talent marketplace.” The service, for which more than 6,500 people have signed up, is mainly for women but will help connect anyone with work ranging from project-based, its focus, to permanent.1 For employers, it can provide skilled female candidates eager to work in flexible roles. The Mom Project, free to job hunters, collects information on their backgrounds and aims and on companies' needs. In candidates, it looks for an undergraduate degree, at least, and five years of work and verifies education and employment histories before someone gets an offer. Employers pay Robinson a service fee of 20 percent of what they pay their new hire. The business has signed up more than 150 employers, including Hyatt Hotels and Penn Mutual Life Insurance Co., and more than 50 have made a match or are close to making one. Resources such as iRelaunch are for women who want to return to work. Après has a job market, while the nonprofit Path Forward focuses on midcareer internships at companies for people following a caregiving stint.2 Robinson said she’s looking to keep millennial women in the workforce, by letting them scale back when they need to. The brand new network currently has some older members. It took Kate Thomson, 37, to the marketing department at Penn Mutual, in Horsham, Pa. She’s on site Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. for an initial six months and has Penn Mutual’s permission to maintain her clients in a consultancy she started in the summer of 2015. The setup allows her to get her five-year-old on the school bus for kindergarten and drop her two-year-old at preschool before work, then reverse the process on the way back. “So it’s almost like they won’t even know I’m gone,” she said. “Which is sort of incredible.” Before she began consulting, Thomson had spent 15 years in marketing and advertising, telecommuting the last several years but with a lot of travel. She came across the Mom Project on Facebook. “I want to wear clothes and talk to grownups,” she said. “But I don’t want to sacrifice my children’s babyhoods for that, and I did that for a long time.” Ten days into her new schedule, Thomson wrote by e-mail that things were going well. She was treasuring spending time with her kids, “soaking them in,” she wrote, but “there's a special joy to be found in commuting BY MYSELF,” when “nobody is touching me or needing things.” Still, untraditional work arrangements may not come with benefits, and years of project-based work could leave a woman ill-prepared to ratchet her salary back up for full-time work. And not every job pans out.  Catherine Siris, 34, a millennial mother of two, had already left her career. The Hershey, Pa., resident has an MBA from George Washington University and completed Johnson & Johnson’s human resources leadership development program. She hasn’t been employed since she had her first child, who is three. “I feel like I’ve lost a piece of my identity, because [career] was such a big part of my life,” she said. The Mom Project submitted her as a candidate for a four-month, full-time, remote position in recruiting, which she thought would be a good test of whether she was ready to return to work full time. Siris, who has also signed up for Après, recently learned from the Mom Project that the company is holding off on the role until early next year.  Robinson doesn’t have a monopoly on flexible work. The Second Shift helps find projects for experienced women; it takes a 5 percent cut when processing a member's payment from an employer and charges the employer 15 percent. MomSource Network charges users a one-time $50 fee and focuses on finding people flexible, long-term positions.3 FlexJobs, at $14.95 a month, with quarterly and yearly options, boasts tens of thousands of job listings. Prokanga offers a network of “vetted flexible talent” and charges that talent 20 percent of their payments.4  If Robinson’s venture expands over time, it will be harder to maintain an intimate environment. Both Thomson and Siris had introductory calls after signing up. Now that isn’t feasible, Robinson said, and the service is trying to engage women digitally.  And scale requires money. So far, Robinson and her husband have been financing the business themselves. The company is working toward closing a round of funding. Robinson took Thomson to a brick-and-mortar office. She may one day return Siris to work. Courtney Hyde, 40, found a job at the Mom Project itself. Hyde, who has a three-year-old daughter, was working as an account executive for LinkedIn Talent Solutions when she saw a Facebook ad for the Mom Project. She signed up in March, before the official launch, looking for project-based or part-time work, wanting a sense of what was out there. Instead, she got a phone call from Robinson and, in June, joined the company full time as vice president of sales, responsible for building and maintaining the base of its employer partners. A big company might want to support working parents, gain employment flexibility through peaks and valleys, or bring in an expert for a project without paying a consultant’s fee, Hyde said.  Employers also come to the Mom Project, signing up on the digital platform. Interface, an Atlanta-based maker of modular flooring with a focus on sustainability, became a partner after Global HR Director Jillian Adams saw an article about it on LinkedIn and was drawn its similar focus on purpose. In the traditional staffing model, Adams said, you deal either with headhunters (or recruiting agencies) who find full-time professionals or with staffing agencies that fill temporary and permanent positions with less-specialized workers. To find highly trained experts to work as consultants, it usually takes a formal consulting or specialized vendor, she noted. A mom Interface hired through the network will soon start a job in communications on a project basis.  In the grand scheme of things, it isn't clear whether millennials or Gen X-ers or anybody will find it easier to navigate flexible work, keeping a baby toe in the workforce while caring for babies. On a smaller scale, there’s Asher, who started walking several weeks ago, with both Mom and Dad in attendance. It was late afternoon, in their basement, where Robinson and her toddler hang out because it’s carpeted. “I feel like I’m making sacrifices to make this model work,” she said. “Being there was a taste of what I want to solve for.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 5 October 2016 | MYT 9:00 AM Advertising on mobile: it's all about 'stopping the thumb' Mobile addiction: Estimates suggest that the average person looks at his or her smartphone as much as 150 times a day. — AFP Relaxnews NEW YORK: Almost 80 years old, the deodorant Old Spice is learning new tricks for finding customers in the era of smartphones and social media.  The Procter & Gamble product, having spoofed itself for years with advice on how to become more "mantastic," posts to its 2.6 million Facebook followers a steady stream of videogames, prize entries, and advertisements as short as two seconds.  Creating "thumb-stopping" content is the goal, and marketers are doing everything they can to achieve it. That includes using neuroscience to study which visual and audio cues offer the best bet to grabbing and keeping an impatient smartphone user's attention.  Estimates show that the average person looks at his or her smartphone as much as 150 times a day. The attention is there, but it's just not long-lived.  "You get the three-second audition," said Frank Amorese, media director at Heineken USA. "If you are relying on the 14th or 15th second to do the heavy lifting of the ad, it's not going to work."  Ever-changing mobile landscape  Advertisers are in a dizzying race to connect with customers as new mobile-borne social media platforms emerge and evolve.  "The landscape changes every six months," Amorese said. "It's changing at an increasingly fast rate."  Digital ad spending is projected to reach US$72.1bil (RM297.57bil) in 2016, growing at a rate of 21% and now comprising almost 37% of the overall market, according to eMarketer. Social media accounts for US$15.4bil (RM63.55bil) of this.  Heineken has doubled its spending on digital ads to 30% over the last five years.  The dominance of smaller mobile devices has heightened the challenge of capturing the attention of potential shoppers.  Ads must be tailored depending on whether they are being seen on a widescreen television, a tablet or a smartphone and must not demand too much time if a consumer is merely glancing at a feed and not planning on a lengthy stay.  "We have to really identify how do consumers engage with every single platform and then what is the creative experience we need to give them," said P&G chief brand officer Marc Pritchard at the four-day Advertising Week conference in New York this week.  "But it also has to look like one brand because people have 5,000 ads coming at them every day and that's 10 times what it was just 10 years ago."  Measuring 'sharing velocity'  Anna Fieler, chief marketing officer at PopSugar, a women's shopping and content site, said marketers are devising benchmarks like "sharing velocity" to monitor resonance.  "Shareability is the gold standard of how engaged people are," she said. "People like it so much that they want to share it with someone else."  Not all Ads place the brand front and centre. Frito-Lay, which spends about 40% of its advertising budget on digital media, offers tips on its Facebook feed on professional mentoring and networking, in addition to the usual fare of ads that aim to excite and amuse.  "People are using social media to build their (personal) brand," said Jeff Klein, vice president of brands and portfolio marketing. Sometimes Frito-Lay just "takes a little bit of a back seat."  'Upload videos like crazy'  Much of the buzz at the Advertising Week conference was the wildfire growth of video streaming and broadcast of live events.  Facebook vice president Will Platt-Higgins predicted video could comprise 80% of all smartphone content by 2020.  "You've got the perfect marriage of basically a supercomputer, which is in your pocket, plus super powerful wifi, plus a video composer and a high-definition camera," he said.  "All of that together creates the perfect storm for all of us to upload videos like crazy and that's what's happening."  The growth of video also opens up new opportunity for rivals like Twitter, which has lagged Facebook in terms of building profits from ads.  Twitter posted 18% growth in advertising revenue last quarter spurred by video. It is betting that marketers will see more upside in plans for live events in pro football and other sports.  Video "is the number one ad format for us now and it barely existed a year ago," said Matt Derella, vice president of global revenue and operations at Twitter. "It's risen extremely fast and it's driven by consumer behaviour." — AFP You May Be Interested Facebook buys facial recognition tech startup Five standout video games in the history of Sony's PS3 Acer unveils a notebook that's thinner than 1cm Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official China badminton star Lin Dan apologises for affair with model while wife was pregnant Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Emphasis on UPSR English language programmes pays off Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot The Star's executive editor Soo Ewe Jin passes away advertisement Latest News US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins Toyota sharpens focus on electric cars through new in-house unit Most Viewed in Tech Hotlink Fast: Get 17GB of data with the new Internet pass Sign your name digitally in iOS Mail Toyota sharpens focus on electric cars through new in-house unit Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead White supremacist ad allowed on Twitter, CEO apologises Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Oct 4, 2016 at 7:44PM Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) stock recently touched $90 per share -- just a few percentage points below an all-time high. The consumer goods titan is up 20% in the last 12 months, making it one of the best-performing members of the Dow. That share-price gain seems to clash with P&G's sinking business trends. Organic growth slowed to just 1% in 2016 from 2% the prior year and 3% in fiscal 2014. However, the company is managing important financial and operating wins that help explain why investors are so optimistic about its stock right now. 1. Cost cuts Every blue chip business is looking for ways to cut costs, but few have had as much success as P&G. It has sliced down its expenses on cost of goods sold to the point where it is saving nearly $1.5 billion per year -- beating the $1.2 billion goal management set in 2012. PG Cost of Goods Sold (TTM) data by YCharts. Since 2012, costs in just that category have dropped by $7 billion. P&G plans to achieve even better results ahead, targeting $10 billion of cumulative productivity savings through fiscal 2021. These improvements promise to send profitability higher.  2. Cash flow One of P&G's core long-term financial targets is to achieve cash flow productivity, or the ratio of free cash flow to adjusted earnings, of at least 90%. The company has trounced that target lately. In fact, P&G generated $12.1 billion of free cash in the past 12 months on earnings of $10.5 billion, yielding a ratio of 115% of earnings. This increase has helped keep cash returns to shareholders rising even as earnings decline due to to a weak selling environment, brand divestments, and foreign-currency moves. 3. Marketing P&G is a skilled marketer -- and that success goes far beyond simply putting out effective TV advertisements at global events like the Olympics. While any company with a large budget can make an international splash like that, P&G's marketing reaches an entirely different level. Image source: P&G. For example, its relationships with hospitals across the country helps it get trial samples of Pampers diapers to 70% of new moms. And when it launched a new Gillette razor recently, its marketing department succeeded in getting a trial product into the hands of 80% of young men. 4. Cutting its losses The company has proven itself ruthless when it comes to walking away from market segments that don't offer the right mix of sales and profit growth. This month's $11 billion sale of its beauty business to Coty is just the single biggest example, but there are over 100 more including P&G's exiting of the value-priced Mexican tissue paper niche. Overall the company has whittled its portfolio down by 105 brands representing 15% of its 2013 sales but just 6% of earnings. Going forward, that shift should produce a leaner, faster-growing, and more profitable company. 5. Cash returns P&G's cash returns have always played a key role in the total returns that shareholders can expect from this stock. In the five years ended in fiscal 2015, the company delivered $60 billion to investors at a pace of about $12 billion per year. Smaller rival Kimberly-Clark, in contrast, has returned about $2 billion per year to shareholders over the last decade. FY = Fiscal year. BN = Billion. Image source: P&G investor presentation. While Kimberly-Clark's return outlook is stable at just below $2 billion, P&G's is soaring. The company expects to deliver $22 billion to shareholders this year on its way to $70 billion in the three years ending in fiscal 2019. These significant wins have helped power solid gains for P&G shareholders lately, but the successes won't mean much if the company can't begin clawing back lost market share. The projected uptick to 2% organic growth this year is encouraging, but it would represent only a small step toward that goal. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos has no position in any stocks mentioned.

And it was not just the campaign itself that departed from the norm, as the Japanese brand brought in a Swedish agency which in turn worked with a Danish partner on media strategy. (For more, read Warc's exclusive report: SK-II Marriage Takeover: How a Japanese skin care brand cut through in China.) My Troedsson, Planner at Forsman & Bodenfors in Sweden, told Warc how the brief – which tasked the agency with creating buzz, strengthening emotional connections and breaking the category language – had taken a long time to properly understand, but that once the team came across the phenomenon of sheng nu (the 'leftover woman'), they seized on it. This is the term given to women who reach the age of 27 without getting married, and whose parents post ads describing them on public display in 'marriage markets'. "The fact we came from outside enabled us to see this in a totally new way," explained Troedsson, as she outlined the disconnect between the traditional expectations of parents and the very different desires of women in today's fast-changing China. "Everyone feels really pressured – parents and daughters – but they don't really talk about it and they feel very alone," she said. That insight, along with research that revealed the target audience wanted to hear about more than just rational product benefits, indicated the direction for the campaign. "We wanted to make use of the fact that no prestige skin care competitor had an emotional and values-driven communication approach," said Troedsson. And the marriage market gave them "a symbolic way to make a statement". An installation in Shanghai's People's Park replaced the dating ads with personalised messages from single women declaring that their independence made them happy; a film focusing on four women and their parents was widely shared on social media both inside and outside the country and generated global media coverage The result has been "a clear increase in sales both in-store and online and an increase in the inflow of new customers", Troedsson reported. But perhaps more importantly, she added, "the ultimate goal is to celebrate women, whatever their personal choices may be, and make them feel valued and appreciated".

The research study covers the present scenario and growth prospects of the global female depilatory marketfor 2016-2020. To calculate the market size, the report considers the revenue generated from the retail and salon sales of female depilatory products and equipment to individual customers in the global market. Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=52528 Technavio's sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. Technavio consumer and retail analysts highlight the following four factors that are contributing to the growth of the global female depilatory market: Product innovation and line extension by vendors Consumer emphasis on personal grooming and hygiene Increased demand for do-it-yourself (DIY) hair removal methods Increase in number of working women leveraging demand for personal grooming Product innovation and line extension by vendors Marketers of depilatory products launch new products to enhance safety and faster way of depilation. The major reason behind that is to gain consumer interest by addressing consumer needs for quick, complete and longer-lasting hair removal. For instance, in 2015, P&G, introduced Gillette Flexball innovation in a razor exclusively for women, the 'Venus Swirl'. The handle of this razor is fitted with a ball-hinge that allows the razor to rotate and provide a clean shave, particularly on body parts like the knees and ankles. P&G sold more than 2.5 million of these razors in the US in 2015. In addition, since the launch of this line in January 2015, Venus brand's share of women's system razors in the US increased by four points and reached to 64% during the end of the same period. Additionally, marketers of the hair removal cream and shave gel segment are diversifying their product lines to meet the wide range of requirements set by the large base of consumers. These include hair removal creams based on the part of the body (legs, bikini line, face, arms, underarms), skin type (normal, sensitive, dry), and desired effect (long-lasting and quick results). Such launches provide more choices and help gauge consumer preferences. Consumer emphasis on personal grooming and hygiene According to Brijesh Kumar Choubey, a lead analyst at Technavio for cosmetics and toiletry research, "Increasing emphasis on personal hygiene and grooming is likely to drive the market for depilatory products over the forecast period." For instance, in the US, a woman spends an average of USD 45 per month on beauty products. The Hispanics form a major part of the beauty industry. In 2015, this population segment spent over 3% more on shaving products than it did in 2014. Similarly, spending by this group on personal care products increased by over 4% from that of 2014. In key developing markets like India, demand for personal care products has grown significantly during the period 2010-2015. Increased demand for do-it-yourself (DIY) hair removal methods The preference for salons is decreasing in developed markets such as Germany, France, the US, the UK, Japan, Canada, and Australia, particularly for regular use, with people increasingly preferring cost-effective do-it-yourself (DIY) methods of removal of unwanted body hair. Hair removal creams and waxes gained considerable popularity during 2010-2015, with many brands offering skin moisturizing and smoothening effects and slower and reduced hair growth. DIY kits are also available to cater to consumers' on-the-go requirements. Products like and the Tweezerman Mini Slant Tweezer and the Helix Threadease Hair Removal System, priced between USD10-15, are affordable options and can easily fit in makeup boxes. Other popular DIY products include the Sally Hansen's Microwavable Eyebrow, Face Lip Wax Kit and Ouch-Relief Stripless Hard Wax Kit, and Ouch-Relief Wax Strip Kit for Face. Increase in number of working women leveraging demand for personal grooming The working population segment is one of the major revenue contributors to the global beauty market. Working women account for a significant share of the total revenue generated in the global female depilatory products market. Globally, more than 55% of the total female population aged between 15-64 years comprised the female labor force in 2014. "This increasing number of working women has created considerable opportunity for depilatory product marketers to grow. They are focusing more on regular or frequently usable depilatory products as well as epilators and electric hair removal systems that provide a quick and smooth solution on a daily basis," says Brijesh. Epilators that have become popular in the global market include Braun Silk-épil epilators, Gillette Venus Silk-expert IPL powered by Braun from P&G and Veet Infini'Silk and Veet Infini'Silk PRO from Reckitt-Benckiser.

Business P&G under pressure as eco-friendly products surge Proctor & Gamble Luke Sharrett / Bloomberg Procter & Gamble Co. (P&G) Tide brand laundry detergent inside a Costco Wholesale Corp. store in Nashville, Tennessee, on Friday, Sept. 25, 2015. Procter & Gamble Co. (P&G) Tide brand laundry detergent inside a Costco Wholesale Corp. store in Nashville, Tennessee, on Friday, Sept. 25, 2015. (Luke Sharrett / Bloomberg) Sarah VeryBloomberg Procter & Gamble Co., which is losing market share to eco-friendly products, is under mounting pressure to either fend off the competitors or buy one of them. The maker of Tide and Crest is struggling to maintain its position in key categories, including skin care, razor blades and laundry detergent. Companies with so-called sustainable brands — products that are seen as more natural, environmentally sensitive or purpose-driven — are chipping away at P&G's longstanding hold on American households. Though P&G remains the world's largest consumer-products company, its wares don't have the same maverick appeal as newer brands. Unilever, P&G's top competitor, raised the stakes last month when it agreed to acquire Seventh Generation, a Vermont-based company that makes sustainable cleaning products. The company had previously acquired Dollar Shave Club — another startup targeting America's bathroom cabinets — and expressed interest in Honest Co., the household-products company co-founded by actress Jessica Alba. Billion Dollar Shave Club: L.A. start-up is purchased by Unilever for a staggering sum Shan Li, David Pierson One of the darlings of the Los Angeles’ start-up scene is cashing in on a $1-billion payday — a rise fueled by a disruptive business model and a series of offbeat viral ads. But this company does not traffic in virtual reality headsets, video games or disappearing messages. Its business, instead,... One of the darlings of the Los Angeles’ start-up scene is cashing in on a $1-billion payday — a rise fueled by a disruptive business model and a series of offbeat viral ads. But this company does not traffic in virtual reality headsets, video games or disappearing messages. Its business, instead,... (Shan Li, David Pierson) The situation may lead to a broader hunt for other sustainable acquisitions, said Philip Gorham, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. Buying a brand like Honest Co. or Method Products — assuming those businesses can be acquired — could help P&G appeal to younger consumers. "The consumer products industry is going niche," he said. "Any number of the multinational consumer product manufacturers would want companies like Honest Co. and Method Products in their portfolio." P&G's sales in core categories have slipped in recent months. Its share of the U.S. skin care market fell to 12.7 percent in September, down from 14.2 percent in July, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, which cited IRI retail data. And the company, which owns Gillette, is facing a declining market for razor blades. At the same time, Dollar Shave's smaller rival, Harry's, has been gaining share. That company recently began selling at Target stores, further squeezing P&G. P&G just sold 41 beauty brands to New York-based Coty Inc., a deal that closed on Monday. But the company may soon return to acquisition mode. Chief Executive Officer David Taylor signaled on a conference call in August that P&G will rely on deals to fill out its product portfolio. "Am I open to M&A bolt-on acquisitions that we think are strategic and would help accelerate the growth in any of our 10 core categories? The answer is clearly yes," he said. Champagne, tacos and time off: How Dollar Shave Club employees are celebrating $1-billion sale Shan Li Alex Janckila, a software engineer at Dollar Shave Club, was sporting something a bit unusual for an employee of a razor company: a five o’clock shadow. “There was happy hour every hour,” Janckila said with a sheepish grin, one hand clutching a large bottle of electrolyte water. “I was happy for... Alex Janckila, a software engineer at Dollar Shave Club, was sporting something a bit unusual for an employee of a razor company: a five o’clock shadow. “There was happy hour every hour,” Janckila said with a sheepish grin, one hand clutching a large bottle of electrolyte water. “I was happy for... (Shan Li) Damon Jones, a spokesman for Cincinnati-based P&G, declined to comment on its acquisition strategy. Unilever, meanwhile, has been more aggressive in snapping up nontraditional brands. It agreed to acquire Dollar Shave Club in July in a deal that was said to be worth about $1 billion. Unilever then set its sights on Seventh Generation, announcing plans to purchase that company in September. The buying spree raised questions about other brands in the category. Unilever has also discussed an acquisition of Honest Co., according to a person familiar with that matter. But Honest Co. may push ahead with a plan for an initial public offering. The startup has been working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley on a possible IPO, people familiar with the matter said earlier this year. Since Alba helped start Honest Co. in 2011, the company has branched out from natural baby products to home cleaning and beauty items. Honest Co. has gotten a foothold in stores such as Target and Whole Foods Market Inc., but it's also faced challenges. Honest Co. was the target of a class-action lawsuit filed last year in which customers claimed its products were deceptively labeled and contained unnatural ingredients. Eco-friendly products typically carry a premium over traditional cleaners and hygiene items — a key advantage at a time when supermarket prices are getting squeezed. Consumers are often willing to pay about 20 percent more for sustainable products, according to Bill Harrison, head of consumer investment banking at Headwaters. The market for sustainable personal health products alone could be worth $117 billion, his firm estimates. But there's always the chance that smaller brands don't want to be acquired by a consumer-products behemoth. Take Method, the San Francisco-based company that sells green cleaners. It agreed to a merger with Belgium's Ecover in 2012 because the companies seemed to have the same philosophy. Drew Fraser, CEO of Method, says Seventh Generation's deal with Unilever was quite different. "By becoming part of Unilever — a company that isn't built on the same philosophy — Seventh Generation risks alienating its current customer base," he said in an e-mail. "Customers in our category want to buy and support brands aligned with their values, so joining Unilever's portfolio may feel disjointed to Seventh Generation's consumers." These concerns may make it difficult for P&G to buy its way into the hearts of sustainable-product shoppers. Instead, the company may need to focus on rehabilitating its own brands, said Ali Dibadj, an analyst from Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. "P&G is still trying to get its house in order," Dibadj said.

The Daily Texan does not guarantee their accuracy. Published on October 4, 2016 at 12:59 am Last update on October 5, 2016 at 6:50 pm By Laura Zhang Shameika Wilmington’s scientific curiosity was sparked in the 1990s when she first looked through a telescope she received as a Christmas gift. Over 20 years later, she continues to explore her passion as a regulatory affairs scientist at Procter & Gamble and an advocate for women and minorities in STEM, or science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields.  Wilmington, who graduated from UT in 2016 with a Ph.D. in biochemistry, uses her degree to make sure household and personal care products comply with government regulations around the world.  While Wilmington does not directly work in a lab, her knowledge of biochemistry helps her communicate and collaborate with scientists who do. She said she must understand the science behind the products in order to help them meet federal regulations. “Science has its own language, and you realize this if you sit in the lab and talk to grad students,” Wilmington said. “They have their own language, and the same thing applies in industry. We have a language we are speaking, and the basis of it is science.” As a graduate student at UT, Wilmington worked in the biochemistry lab of molecular biosciences professor Andreas Matouschek. His lab studies and regulates the biological cellular processes of proteins by understanding the complement of protein synthesis which is protein degradation. Wilmington took a new angle and targeted the proteins that already existed by molding her project around the mechanism of protein degradation. According to Matouschek, this project made the lab much more collaborative, bringing in researchers from other fields, such as chemistry.  “She really had to do a lot of creative and original things,” Matouschek said. “It took a lot of initiative and independence and courage [to do things the lab doesn’t normally do].” At UT, Wilmington also served as a science and research mentor for high school students through an outreach program with Austin Regional Science Festival. One of her mentees, Shazma Khan, is now a biology and public health junior at UT.  Khan said working with Wilmington, a minority woman in STEM, changed her preconceived archetype of who scientists are. According to Khan, Wilmington’s ability to explain technical jargon and relate to Khan convinced her to pursue research. “For me, I had that stereotype with scientists and lab work, where I just thought of a guy who was socially awkward and very preoccupied with what was in his petri dish,” Khan said. “So the fact that I had Shameika, who’s a minority woman and really fun to talk to and the opposite of what I was expecting, was a breath of fresh air.” Khan said it is crucial to shatter prejudices in STEM fields where the lack of diversity is apparent, especially in tenure faculty and science leadership. According to Khan, although the number of women and minorities in STEM is increasing, unconscious bias still remains. “I’m in this group project in lab and there’s this one guy who doesn’t let anyone else do anything, so everyone’s like ‘OK, whatever,’” Khan said. “But if I were that person who started doing everything, everyone would label me as annoying and a control freak, whereas for him he’s ‘confident’ and ‘taking initiative.’” Wilmington said she continues outreach efforts, hoping to inspire other young scientists. One time, she was judging a poster competition when a young girl around nine years old came up to her.  “[This girl came up to me and said], ‘Are you one of the scientists?’ and I said yes, so she grabs her mom and says, ‘Mom, she’s a scientist!’” Wilmington said. “That moment, I will never forget, because I got used to myself as a scientist. But for this young girl, me coming up to her … was something different. It was something she needed to question, and it got her really excited.” According to Wilmington, mentoring women and minority scientists in STEM is crucial to advancing the field as a whole. “Yes, I know I’m underrepresented,” Wilmington said. “But at the same time, that’s why my representation is so important.”  View the discussion thread.

The Lowdown is Ad Age's weekly look at news nuggets from across the world of marketing, including trends, campaign tidbits, executive comings and goings and more. Bud Light's New Design Credit: Bud Light Anheuser-Busch InBev is close to overtaking PepsiCo as the nation's top sponsorship spender, according to a new ranking. The two NFL sponsors opened up a sizeable gap on third-place spender Coca-Cola Co., according to the annual ranking by sponsorship consultancy IEG, which calculates sponsorship fees in the U.S. and the portion of international spending dedicated to the U.S. PepsiCo spent between $365 million-$370 million and $375 million, according to IEG estimates. A-B InBev is not far behind as its spending jumped from $300 million-$305 million in 2014 to $360 million to $365 million last year. Coke, which ended its "American Idol" sponsorship in 2014, retained the No. 3 spot, but its spending fell from $290 million-$295 million in 2014 to $275 million-$280 million last year. General Motors, which dropped its NFL sponsorship in 2014, fell from fifth to ninth and is now behind Ford. Here is the top 20, courtesy of IEG: U.S. Top 20 Sponsors chart Credit: IEG Here is more proof that Nike won the Olympics: Three of the marketer's ads made Ace Metrix's list of the top 10 breakthrough ads from the third quarter. Placing first was Nike's 145-second digital spot about Paralympian runner Scout Bassett. The ad (below) is part of the "Unlimited" campaign that got heavy airplay during the Olympics. The fifth and 10th-place ads also belonged to Nike. Frosted Flakes took the second spot with its "Let Your Gr-r-reat Out'" ad that features an 11-year-old girl in a wheelchair at a skate park. Tying for No. 2 was a long-form ad from Olive Garden, while BMW took third place with an ad featuring a Paralympian. "Nike, Frosted Flakes and BMW all delivered humbling and inspiring messages, making that strong emotional connection that engages viewers," said Peter Daboll, CEO of Ace Metrix. Pampers' 'Pooface' Credit: Pampers What brand delivers the world's best customer experience? Surprisingly, Pampers, according to WPP's brand experience agency Group XP, which found the Procter & Gamble Co. brand edged Disney and Paypal. Pampers' end users are notoriously hard to survey, but the algorithm behind the ranking is really based on such factors as branding, store design, content, online presence and user experience, based on data drawn over a 10-year period by WPP sibling Millward Brown's Brand Z. Amazon actually scored first in the U.S. on customer experience, followed by Pampers, with the two flipping the top two spots in the U.K. Rival Kimberly-Clark Corp.'s Huggies also did well, coming in 12th globally and fourth in the U.S. With so many babies having such great diaper experiences, the world's future is undoubtedly bright. Clorox Co. is better known for bleach and cleaners than snack foods, but that may be about to change. The company, which also markets Hidden Valley Ranch and KC Masterpiece, is rolling out a social media campaign to back an extension of its Soy Vay line of Asian sauces and marinades into Asian-flavored snacks. A #SnackHour hub on Tumblr, launching Thursday, is backed by social media influencers who include Matt Bellasai, formerly of BuzzFeed and a People's Choice "Social Media Star of the Year." Soy Vay also will get paid advertising on Tumblr and Facebook, public relations and sampling programs. AKQA, Current and the in-house Clorox Digital Labs are handling the effort. For years – at least since Fusion launched in 2005 – people have wondered what fully new system P&G's Gillette would come up with next. Some speculation has focused on a razor with heated blades. Well, now that system is here, but it's not from Gillette. SmartRazor is hitting the market, kind of, with a Kickstarter campaign that launched yesterday. The backers are not just scruffy bootstrappers who know nothing about bending metal. They also sell ShaveMate razors with shaving cream dispensed from the handle and backed via direct-response ads featuring prolific pitchman Anthony Sullivan. SmartRazor CEO Lou Tomassetti said he's gotten keen interest in the heavily patented SmartRazor since a 2015 teaser showing at CES, and most recently from big retailers. Now, he's just looking for the capital to make it. Another formerly scruffy startup, Dollar Shave Club, recently sold to Unilever for $1 billion, is poking a bit of fun at its parent-to-be in the yet-to-close deal in a new in-house campaign for its latest line extension – Wanderer body wash and bath products. The ads lampoon muscle-bound imagery from P&G's Old Spice or hormone-infused ads akin to Unilever's Axe of old (though the body-wash bottle in question looks more like Suave), with a voiceover from Dollar Shave Club CEO Michael Dubin asking: "How about a shower product that's more you?" Chobani is eager to post more videos with BuzzFeed's Tasty after a successful Olympic-themed run. Tasty, which has been around for a little more than a year with its food-focused videos, said Chobani was one of the first brands it partnered with back in December. This summer, Tasty aired three Chobani videos produced by BuzzFeed with a bit of a different look and feel from Tasty's regular content. The videos included shots of athletes Morgan Brian and Marlen Esparza instead of focusing just on the top-down recipe preparation shots Tasty is known for. The most popular video showed soccer player Ms. Brian preparing a chicken, quinoa and avocado salad. In all, the three videos reached nearly 154 million people, with more than 83 million views, 1 million likes, and about half a million shares, BuzzFeed said. Those figures were exponentially higher than results from other Chobani videos Tasty posted in late 2015 and early 2016. Both sides said they learned throughout the process, noting for example that videos were shared more often when they included the word healthy when discussing a recipe. Chobani, which pays for views, not engagement, said the 1.2 million likes/shares and comments across the videos topped its engagement expectations. Chobani and Tasty are working on projects for the upcoming holiday season that may include experimenting with Tasty's Nifty or other franchise brands. Tasty has also worked with food brands including Mondelez and Diageo. It may still feel like summer in parts of the country but the fall and winter soup season is heating up. Progresso's new batch of spots tout that it is the first large U.S. grocery store brand using only antibiotic- and hormone-free chicken breasts in all of its chicken soup. The spots mark the General Mills' brand's first work from the Joan Agency and feature voiceover by actor John Lithgow. The Progresso spots show off the brand's new packaging featuring a redesign worked on by Hornall Anderson that marks Progresso's first big packaging makeover in more than 10 years. Advertising Age Player The next spot set to air after one that launched the campaign in late September is "Opus" (above), which should run from Oct. 10 through mid December. Another one of four new spots set to run later in soup season is "Contained," which focuses on the brand's broth (below). Advertising Age Player Cincinnati-based Nehemiah Manufacturing, which gives second chances to orphan brands, ex-convicts and people recovering from addictions, is branching out with a new brand – Saline Soothers. The saline-infused wipes, aimed at preventing irritation for people wiping runny noses, are something of an adult-positioned extension of the Boogie Wipes brand the company sells for kids (and their parents). With this launch, Nehemiah is also for the first time incorporating its social mission into its consumer marketing, said VP-Marketing Eric Wellinghoff. Packages of Saline Soothers include a new "2C" logo and message "Every purchase helps provide jobs for Second Chance Employees." About half of Nehemiah's 100-plus employees have done time on felony convictions or are recovering from drug and alcohol problems. Saline Soothers are backed by a video, directing people to buy the product at Walgreens and Rite Aid stores, from Molio, the Salt Lake City, Utah, agency founded by Jeff Davis, who launched Orabrush, acquired last year by DenTek. Other Nehemiah brands include P&G castoffs Downy Wrinkle Releaser, Dreft and Kandoo. We end with a holiday note: Kids and adults alike might want to sink their teeth into the North Pole Santa displays at a handful of shopping centers this Christmas. Mall operator General Growth Properties has tapped candy seller It's Sugar to outfit the sections, branded as It'Sugar Winter Escape. The 10-year-old candy brand will fill 2,000 square feet with a host of confectionary delights, like a tree made of candy, 100,000 jelly beans, and a marshmallow snowman. The experience will be limited to five malls in Friendswood, Texas; San Antonio, Texas; Tucson, Ariz.; Newark, Del.; and Pembroke Pines, Fla. The kiosks are meant to provide another reason to draw visitors to brick-and-mortar shopping as malls face foot traffic declines. Contributing: Jack Neff, Jessica Wohl, Adrianne Pasquarelli, E.J.

The next level: UAE graduates' expectations of their first job 05 October, 2016 05 October 2016 It is a tough time to be a fresh university graduate no matter where you live at the moment amid concern about global economic growth and political uncertainty. In the Middle East, the sharp drop in oil prices has led governments and companies to tighten their belts and reconsider hiring plans. Online recruitment firm GulfTalent surveyed 303 recent graduates and final-year students from the American University of Sharjah for insight into how a future generation is feeling and thinking. Carried out in June this year and across a range of academic backgrounds and nationalities, the findings raised a number of interesting conclusions and showed how diverse graduates' expectations are. Read the full report here. Dubai-based airline Emirates Group was deemed the most popular company for fresh university graduates in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), followed by international consumer goods company Unilever, local fashion firm the Chalhoub Group, GE, Nestle, ADNOC, Petrofac, Pwc, Procter & Gamble and Etihad Airways. There was a big difference along gender grounds, with male graduates more attracted by multinationals and technical firms, while female graduates focused more on government organisations and consumer goods firms. Three quarters of UAE nationals were attracted to government entities or companies majority-owned by the government, while 91 percent of their expat rivals preferred multinational companies, such as Unilever, GE or Nestle. Locally owned private firms appear to be less attractive, favoured by only 3 percent of expatriates and 12 percent of Emiratis. So what attracted graduates to specific employers? The survey found the dominant factors cited by the majority of graduates when it came to their preferred employers were finding interesting work, training opportunities and how reputable the company's brand is. While pay scales were not stated as a high criteria by graduates, their expectations on starting salaries varied dramatically. Expatriate graduates on average expect a starting salary of 9,000 dirhams ($2,450) per month. By contrast, the average starting salary expected by an Emirati graduates was 27,000 dirhams, or three times their expatriate rivals. Finally, at the end of the day, despite the differences in perception, a third of Emirati graduates said they had a job lined up, while only one in five of expats said they had a contract signed when they finished their studies. © Copyright Zawya.

If you are a subscriber, simply log in or Subscribe now! This week I want to give you some pointers about saving money in all kinds of ways. There are several kinds of coupons, discounts depending on your age and what you do and other discounts you can buy to help save. You also can combine some coupons, gift cards and discounts to save even more. Coupons It is easy to accumulate manufacturer coupons when you receive the Sunday Herald and News. Red Plum and Smart Source have coupons in the paper weekly — except over major holiday weekends — and Proctor and Gamble provides coupons in the paper once a month. If you need an extra set of coupons, you can stop by the Herald and News and pick up a Sunday paper during the week for a reduced cost. Simply cut out the coupons you will use — or think you might want to try — and sort them by expiration date. Story continues below video × They will all have an expiration date stores strictly adhere to. Match your clipped coupons to store ads and be sure to take them with you when you shop. Also check with the stores you shop at to make sure they accept manufacturer coupons as some of the local discount stores do not. Some manufacturer coupons also are available online and can be loaded to the rewards cards of specific stores, instead of printing and cutting out coupons. Watch advertisements in the paper for store coupons – they are different from manufacturer coupons in that they can only be used at the specific store that the ad is for. Some, but not all, store coupons can be combined with manufacturer coupons, especially for food items. Most store coupons are for extra percentages off certain departments or items in the store. Be sure to read the coupon for details on what the store coupon applies to and the dates it is effective. Rewards Some box stores, or national chain stores, have reward cards where you earn points based on how much or what you buy that can then be used as store credit or cents off your next gasoline purchase. As mentioned above, you can pre-load manufacturer coupons to some stores’ rewards cards as well as free items that are offered and any other specials that may apply to that store at that time. There’s even a rewards card for our local cinemas, and you can earn a free popcorn or even a free movie pass. So be sure to have your rewards card scanned when you make a purchase to get the best bang for your buck. Special discounts At some entertainment places — such as at the movies or bowling — there are discounts for children and seniors, as well as the military. But you will need to ask when or if those discounts apply. Also, check with stores to see if and when they offer senior or military discounts, for either a percentage off, or special pricing. You would be amazed how many of our local stores offer military and senior discounts as well as our restaurants and fast food eateries. Most of them do not publicize the discounts, so you will need to ask. Also check the Herald and News and the Nickel for coupons for certain restaurants that are good for dollars off or percentage off – be sure to check the expiration dates. Smart Source in the Sunday Herald and News sometimes offers restaurant coupons for both in and out of town. Other discounts There are other ways to save even more with coupon books or cards sold locally, generally by students in the schools. The books or cards mostly offer single use two-for-one meals or entertainment. Fundraising groups that have silent or oral auctions have items you can possibly buy at a good deal and the money goes to a good cause. Gift cards are another way to save money either by buying them at a reduced cost on some online sites or buying them at a local store that will then double (or quadruple their value) toward gas purchases saving you more at the pump. So it might be worth it to invest some time in understanding and using coupons to help you stretch your money. And remember, it doesn’t hurt to ask for discounts at the store or restaurant to save even more.

While some perfume-makers rely on celebrities, such as Kendall Jenner kicks, to move their products, the industry appears to be shifting toward artisanal scents.  (Jamie McCarthy / GETTY IMAGES)   By Stephanie WongBloomberg Tues., Oct. 4, 2016 Fabrizio Freda, the chief executive officer of Estee Lauder Cos., could tell the fragrance industry was changing by watching the members of his own family. His grandfather picked a signature cologne and never changed it, Freda says. But the executive’s son hasn’t shown that kind of loyalty — a typical attitude for younger consumers. If they wear cologne or perfume, they switch between niche brands and opt for smaller bottles. “The new generation really looks at fragrances as a wardrobe but not anymore as a personal signature,” the 59-year-old said in an interview. Many millennials don’t want mass-market perfumes, and celebrity scents — once a vibrant part of the industry — have fallen into decline. But so-called artisanal fragrances are surging. Sales of the products, which sometimes come in offbeat varieties, rose 22 per cent last year, according to the research firm NPD Group. That made them the fastest-growing fragrance segment. In short, millennials no longer want to smell like Justin Bieber or Britney Spears — they’d rather have the scent of a smoky fireplace or old lipstick. And they don’t want to wear the same perfume every day. Article Continued Below Merger deals also are reshaping the industry and intensifying competition. Revlon agreed to buy Elizabeth Arden this year, teaming up with a large maker of celebrity perfumes. And Coty is poised to become the world’s largest seller of fragrance when it completes its purchase of Procter & Gamble Co.’s 41 beauty brands this year. Premium scents have kept the industry growing despite a slump in mass-market perfumes and colognes. The $6.6 billion market for U.S. artisanal products and other premium fragrances is projected to grow 18 per cent by 2020, according to Euromonitor International. Mass-market fragrances, meanwhile, are forecast to drop 15 per cent. Celebrity brands were once seen as key growth drivers for Elizabeth Arden and Coty. But sales in that category dropped 31 per cent in 2015, according to the NPD. Coty Chairman Bart Becht said his company plans to refocus on top designer brands, such as Marc Jacobs and Gucci, while cutting out some other names. Elizabeth Arden, which gets three-quarters of its sales from scents, also could shift more toward premium names under Revlon. Estee Lauder, best known for cosmetics and face cream, has used on the artisanal trend to fuel growth. Its fragrance sales increased faster than any other segment besides makeup last year. And the scents are more profitable than some designer-label products because they don’t require the same advertising and promotion, Freda said. Estee Lauder’s Frederic Malle, Le Labo and By Kilian scents might not be known to most consumers, but they are some of its most promising fragrance brands. It also sells scents under the more recognizable names of Tom Ford and Jo Malone, offered in such varieties as nutmeg, ginger and wood sage and sea salt. “A lot of people won’t have heard of these brands, but that’s what makes them cool because it’s not the same fragrance that you smell on everybody walking down the street,” said Eleanor Dwyer, a beauty analyst at Euromonitor. “It’s a discovery that you made. You liked it, and you bought it — and you’re wearing it.” For the past five years, the top brands in the U.S. have been dominated by European companies, Chanel SA and L’Oreal SA, according to Euromonitor data. But New York-based Estee Lauder has climbed the charts with its Jo Malone scents. The label jumped to the No. 9 spot last year, up from No. 24 five years ago. Angela Lopez, who works in finance in New York and wore Chanel No. 5 in her college years, is an example of a millennial shopper looking for something different. “I used to wear what’s popular, but I don’t want to smell like everyone else now,” said the 31-year-old. “There are some perfumes that you smell everywhere. I like to discover new names and buy from small boutiques. It’s more expensive, but it’s worth it.” That attitude has prompted the industry to adopt smaller sizes, such as rollerballs that come in at around 10 millilitres. That’s the fastest-growing form of packaging, with an increase of 50 per cent or more last year, according to Euromonitor data. Most other sizes either dropped or grew less than 1 per cent. Rollerball-size fragrances can cost less than half the normal price, making it easier for budget-conscious millennials to try out new scents, said Karen Grant, a beauty analyst at the NPD. That could then build a foundation for the future. “A younger consumer is able to discover, experiment, carry it with them,” Grant said. “Different formats provide access to even higher-end fragrances, so then they are ready to graduate into a full fragrance.” The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

Published on October 04, 2016. Reprints Reprints Carolyn Everson. Credit: Nathan Skid for Advertising Age Most Popular Carolyn Everson is drawing on the wall at Facebook's offices in New York. It's a warning sign of sorts. There's a graph of revenue over time, and there are four basic kinds of companies represented: the comfortable giants with plenty of money but plateauing growth, rivals that have more or less caught the giants and are still growing, the startups that might come for them all, and the flameouts. "This is something that I've been using to guide a lot of my conversations with key clients over the last nine months," Ms. Everson said. "So a lot of what we do, culture is the most important." Why is Facebook's VP-global marketing solutions so focused on what she calls "culture" questions? Here's what Ms. Everson had to say about how she's schooling the industry to not just innovate but, of course, use Facebook to do so. This conversation has been lightly edited. Advertising Age: What do you tell advertisers about "culture" and why it's important? Carolyn Everson: Think of it this way. There are the traditional companies -- General Motors, Ford, Marriott, Starwood, Procter and Gamble, Unilever, Coke, Pepsi -- the traditional companies that have been around a long time, and they're either growing in single digits or they're declining or flattening, but none of them are skyrocketing, for the most part. Related Stories Facebook's Marketplace Has an Edge on Craigslist, but No Room for Marketers (Yet) P&G, GM and Facebook Agree: Big Is Beautiful Facebook Tells Advertisers to Speed Up Sites or Don't Bother Asking for Clicks Unilever Buys Dollar Shave Club for $1 Billion, Opening New Front Against P&G Walmart Chasing Amazon With $3.3B Acquisition of Jet.com GM Invests $500 Million in Lyft to Battle Uber, Build Network of Self-Driving Taxis Then there are these disruptors. They're emerging on the scene. They're often mobile-first. They get a lot of excitement. They get the funding, but they execute really poorly and they implode, because if you think about it every day, about 1,000 apps get sent to iOS and Android for approval. They all don't make it. There are these companies that are superhot and, poof, they're gone. Then there are you know, take Walmart, Target, and take Amazon. Amazon is clearly coming at them. And sometimes these types of companies are too small for the bigger companies to even see a hit on their revenue, but you know they're coming. Ad Age: How can Facebook even begin to help with a client's culture? Ms. Everson: With 4 million advertisers we get to see all the different kinds of companies, because we have relationships with all the top marketers. And the disruptors often are building their businesses -- they might spend 90% of their investment on Facebook. That's not an uncommon thing we see. Ad Age: So, you've helped diagnose cultural shifts for clients. How does that help Facebook? Ms. Everson: Here's the thing. If you can start to act more like a disruptor -- move fast, get rid of the silos, become more collaborative, more data-driven -- what we do becomes more intuitive. They start saying, "Of course, we need to create hundreds of versions of creative and test them." And, of course, we can't be on a six- to nine-month creative cycle, because that's just not the way these digital environments work. And, of course, we're going to measure business outcomes and not proxy metrics. Ad Age: What do you tell any lumbering companies to do? Ms. Everson: There are four strategies. You can't just sit there and say I'm not going to do anything. One is acquisition -- what Unilever did with Dollar Shave Club. And Walmart bought Jet. Just in the last two months that happened. The second strategy that we see is to create an investment arm of your company and invest like you're a VC. That's what General Motors did with Lyft. They gave them $500 million, and I'm sure they'd love Lyft to be successful, but on the other side I'm sure GM is doing it to learn. The third one is to create what I've called parallel organizations by setting up a separate team in the company that operates with different KPIs. The fourth is rewiring of the culture, and that's the hardest one to do. It is hard to find companies that have rewired themselves culturally. IBM is one. They've done a really good job of rewiring their culture. Kodak is one example -- they blew all four strategies. Ad Age: How does all this culture talk fit into all the changes in advertising? For instance, do you see brands continuing to change their agencies, which we've seen a lot of? Ms. Everson: I do hear there will be more, but I don't know. My hope for the industry is that they're being done in the right spirit, in the spirit of maybe changing the model of how they are working. Perhaps they want media and creative to work more closely together, which I personally think is going to be a major theme we're going to see in the agency community. If you look at AT&T's decision around Omnicom and Hearts & Science and BBDO, it's a blending of media and creative. Media and creative I just think have to come closer together. Even if a brand gives its media to one holding company and creative to another, they will need them both to be working together more closely.

By James Gray / Published 4th October 2016 GETTY NEW BOY: Bradley is the first American manager in Premier League history March 3, 1958: Robert Bradley was born in Montclair, New Jersey, the oldest of three sons to his parents Jerry and Mary. His father had turned down a minor league baseball contract with the Chicago Cubs to join the Marines. On his return from Korea he went to Upsala College and played baseball and American football but never went professional, and never had any interest in ‘soccer’. 1970: Bradley went to West Essex High School which was rare in that it was a school that took football seriously when others were playing the American version. The best Premier League summer signings XI Tuesday, 4th October 2016 THE 2016/17 Premier League season is well and truly underway - and it seems as though some clubs have performed some fantastic business over the summer. 1 / 12 GETTY GK: Steve Mandanda - Brought in on a free and has already begun to shown his quality for Palace. A huge upgrade on Hennessey 1976: Bradley played on the right wing for four years and graduated as one of the highest rated players in the state. He was accepted into Princeton but didn’t want to go because they did not offer an athletic scholarship. But his parents told him they would make the money work. 1978: In his second year at university, his footballing days looked like they might be ended by a bad leg break. But he rehabilitated himself and returned to the game the following summer and scored four times on his return. 1981: Having briefly worked for Proctor & Gamble, Bradley joined the Ohio University management programme and got his first job in management aged just 22. 1984: Bradley worked his way to the job in charge of the Princeton Tigers just four years after he had left the team as a player. In his 11 years there he won two Ivy League titles and reached the national semi-finals. 1987: Bob's son is born, Michael. He would go on to win more than 100 caps for the US and played for Aston Villa and Roma. He now plays in MLS for Toronto FC. 1996: After working at the Olympics as an assistant on the US under-23s, Bradley was taken on by Bryce Arena at DC United in the first year of Major League Soccer. 1998: Bradley got his first managerial post on a professional team when he was hired by the Chicago Fire and won the MLS Cup and US Open Cup in his first year. He won MLS Coach of the Year for his achievements. 2002: Bradley returned to his home state to manage the MetroStars, and turned their fortunes around significantly. 2003: MetroStars reached the final of the US Open Cup and the play-offs. 2005: Bradley was unable to maintain his early form though and is fired three games before the end of the season. 2006: Bradley was appointed to US soccer’s top job, in charge of the national team, and won the Gold Cup within a year of taking over. 2010: Bradley led the US to the top of Group C at the 2010 World Cup, beating Algeria and drawing with Slovenia before losing to Ghana in the last 16. 2011: After defeat in the Gold Cup final to Mexico, Bradley was sacked. He was out of work for just two months before taking over the Egyptian national team. 2013: After Egypt were beaten 7-3 on aggregate by Ghana in the last round of qualifying for the 2014 World Cup, Bradley was dismissed. 2014: Bradley became the first ever American to manage in a European top division when he was given the Stabaek job in Norway. 2015: Having led Stabaek to a third place in the Norwegian league, Bradley was poached by Le Havre in Ligue 2. He took over with the side struggling in 15th position but finished the season in 4th. 2016: With Le Havre 5th in Ligue 2, Bradley was brought in at Swansea to replace Francesco Guidolin with the Swans 17th in the Premier League after seven games.

While the southern edge of the storm is still in Haiti, affecting the northern part of the country, the 200-strong in-country American Red Cross staff and its Haitian partners are conducting initial damage assessments today to begin emergency response efforts and distributions. IT/Telecommunications equipment is being mobilized to further support overall communication and coordination in country, and emergency relief supplies, including hygiene kits, kitchen kits, and cholera kits are being delivered to vulnerable locations in the north and south. In the United States, the American Red Cross is preparing a large multi-state response to help people in the path of Hurricane Matthew as the storm heads toward the southeast coast. The Red Cross has shelters, more than 500 disaster workers and 90 response vehicles standing by in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. In Florida, the Red Cross is prepared to open or support as many as 100 evacuation shelters and has more than 30 emergency response vehicles standing by. In South Carolina, the Red Cross plans to open or support 19 evacuation shelters today, and dozens of additional shelters are ready to open in Georgia and North Carolina, as needed. The Red Cross has also prepositioned 30 trailer loads of sheltering supplies, ready-to-eat meals as well as clean-up kits and comfort kits containing personal hygiene items. "We're preparing for a large response across several states, opening dozens of shelters to make sure people have a safe place to stay and food to eat as Hurricane Matthew marches northward," said Brad Kieserman, vice president, Disaster Operations and Logistics for the Red Cross. "This is a dangerous storm, the most powerful Atlantic hurricane since Felix in 2007. As the Red Cross gets ready, we urge people who may live in the path of this storm to make their own preparations now. It's critical that coastal residents pay close attention to the forecast and listen to their local authorities, as even a small shift in the storm could have a significant impact." The Red Cross is also working in close collaboration with government officials and community partners to coordinate preparedness activities and potential response efforts. DOWNLOAD EMERGENCY APP  Everyone should download the Red Cross Emergency App to have safety information available on their mobile device, including emergency weather alerts, safety information and shelter locations. Red Cross apps are available in smartphone app stores by searching for the American Red Cross or going to redcross.org/apps. HAVE A DISASTER KIT  Include a gallon of water per person - enough for three days, a three-day supply of non-perishable food, family and emergency contact information, copies of important papers and a map of the area. More details on what to include are available here. HURRICANE SAFETY  People living in the path of the hurricane should listen to local officials and obey any evacuation orders. Other safety steps include: Know your evacuation route. Bring in anything that can be picked up by the wind. Close doors, windows and hurricane shutters. If someone doesn't have shutters, close and board up all windows and doors with plywood. Fill the car's gas tank. Avoid flooded roads and bridges. Turn around, don't drown. PLEASE GIVE BLOOD Hurricane Matthew has already forced the cancellation of about a dozen Red Cross blood drives in South Carolina resulting in approximately 570 donations going uncollected. Dozens more blood drive cancellations are possible along the East Coast depending on the path and impact of the storm. In addition to blood drive cancellations, the Red Cross is also at risk of being unable to collect more than 100 platelet donations if donation centers are forced to close over the next few days. Platelets, a key clotting component of blood often needed by cancer patients, must be transfused within five days of donation and, therefore, are always in demand. The Red Cross has sent additional blood products to areas likely to be impacted by the storm and will send more as needed to ensure patient needs continue to be met. The Red Cross encourages eligible donors in parts of the country unaffected by the storm to please give blood or platelets to help ensure we have a readily available blood supply for patients in need. Even before the threat of Hurricane Matthew, there was an urgent need for donors of all blood types, especially type O. Appointments can be made by using the Red Cross Blood Donor App, visiting redcrossblood.org or calling 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767). MAKE A DONATION The work of the American Red Cross starts long before a hurricane makes landfall in the United States. For example, we have warehouses stocked with disaster relief supplies, thousands of trained workers, and more than 320 mobile response vehicles on standby year-round to be ready to help people in need. If we didn't maintain these resources 24/7, we couldn't get help to people in a timely fashion—but we depend on donations from the American public to be ready. Help people affected by disasters like hurricanes, floods and countless other crises by making a donation to Red Cross Disaster Relief. Your gift enables the Red Cross to prepare for, respond to and help people recover from disasters big and small across the United States. Visit redcross.org, call 1-800-RED CROSS or text the word REDCROSS to 90999 to make a $10 donation.

Glasgow marked the Senator’s second stop on a 650 mile long tour that will undertake in three days. After flying into Malta on Oct. 4 to begin his tour, Glasgow was the second stop out of the 15 planned destinations. The Senator took time to address a crowd of 20 local leaders, business owners, ranchers and members of the press at the event hosted by Farm Equipment Sales. The Senator addressed local concerns on issues as well as national ones. The Senator met with city officials and county commissioners to discuss how he will work with them to solve the sticky situation that has become of our levy south of town. Citing that there were some survey errors made, he aims to work with our local government to help forge a plan to move forward and hold the federal government accountable for their mistakes. Daines went further to state that he wants to make sure we are protected, particularly as far as private property rights and that our concerns over flood insurance rate will be addressed as well. He spoke about a bill he is working on that would give local governments more control over land usage. The common sense bill deals with issues and concerns over such things as our veterans monument, and prevent federal land grabs. Daines spoke about the US beef ban in China, and how the 13-year long ban is looking like it will be finally lifted. The Senator recently went to China with two other members of the senate and two members of congress. Daines cited he has experience with how the Chinese market works, as he had spent five years there while employed by Proctor and Gamble. With the ban lifted he expects to see US beef shipped to China sometime next year. He also took time to address other concerns ranging from free roaming bison, the Affordable Health Care, and water concerns. The Senator will continue his tour with his next stop being in Scobey, followed by Westby, Plentywood and Culbertson on Tuesday. Wednesday tour stops include Sidney, Glendive, Wibaux, Baker. Ekalaka, Broads, and Ashland will be the final three stops on Thursday.

The stunning Saturdays star was a runner up in the final of the BBC One dancing show in 2014. WENN 5 Frankie Bridge would love Len Goodman’s job Speaking exclusively to The Sun Online about who she’d like to get the Strictly judging job, Frankie says: “I think it should be me! “Imagine me sitting there, ‘Oh, you’ve turned your toe in there.’ I don’t know what I’m talking about.” The mum-of-two does know that whoever takes Len’s job when he retires at the end of this series has a big job ahead of them. Frankie says: “I’m devastated Len’s leaving. Getty Images 5 Len revealed he wouldn’t be coming back when this series of Strictly Come Dancing ends “I think whoever fills Len’s boots will have a hard job, they’ll be given a hard time. He’s going to be missed but I don’t blame him. He goes backwards and forwards to America to do the US version and stuff.” Frankie’s former partner, Kevin Clifton, is paired with her friend Louise and she’s been watching the couple avidly since the launch show. BBC 5 Frankie is cheering on her friend Louise and her former Strictly partner Kevin She explains: “Obviously I’m rooting for Kevin and I know Louise as well. “I was part of the ‘you have to do it, you have to do it’ crowd and then they got paired together – it’s perfect me for I still get to cling on.

Peter Andre, Frankie Bridge and Alex Jones support the Do Your Thing campaign for Children In Need “Louise is so good but she’s always really nervous. She’s not overly confident so it’s going to be amazing for her and she’s got the best partner. “Kevin is amazing, even when you think you can’t do something he’ll make it fun. He’s not like a taskmaster but you always get there in the end.” Doug Peters 5 Frankie Bridge opens the salon to celebrate Superdrug’s #FeelSuper campaign, which aims to raise money for the Marie Curie charity Frankie was speaking to The Sun Online at the #FeelSuper Salon Launch to celebrate Superdrug and P&G’s campaign supporting Marie Curie. Until 18 October, at Superdrug each time you buy from selected P&G products including brands such as Olay, Gillette, Oral-B and Max Factor, you’ll trigger a donation to Marie Curie. The cause is something close to Frankie’s heart. She explains: “In the past with the Saturdays we did lot with Marie Curie, I’ve been around the hospitals and met a lot of the nurses and I can see where the money goes. “I’ve known people with terminal illnesses and I’ve known people Marie Curie have helped, it’s the little things that they do. Doug Peters 5 Frankie spent the day with some of the Marie Curie nurses as they launched the pop-up “It’s a hard job, going into someone’s home at that time in people’s lives must be really difficult – I don’t think many people could do what these nurses do. They stay so upbeat and so lovely and they work throughout the night. “Last time we went out to raise £100,000 and we made over £200,000 – that’s the equivalent of 10 nurses for a year. “This year we want to do even better than that!” Harry Redknapp jokes about the Strictly Come Dancing 'curse' with son Got a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk or call us direct on 02077824220 Topics Frankie Bridge Len Goodman Louise Redknapp Strictly Come Dancing Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments Comments Most Read in TV & Showbiz back on Nick Knowles moves back in with estranged wife Jessica Moor TV & Showbiz Pictured no BLURRED tan LINES Emily Ratajkowski goes topless as she pulls her swimsuit down to her waist TV & Showbiz Video EXTREMELY DISTASTEFUL I'm a Celebrity viewers blast hosts Ant and Dec over Stephen Hawking sketch TV & Showbiz Exclusive don't old back, joel Joel Dommett's ex girlfriend backs his I'm A Celebrity flirting with Carol Vorderman - despite their 25… TV & Showbiz Pictured SNOWDON GETS A SOAK Lisa Snowdon strips to bikini and flashes cleavage in I'm A Celebrity shower TV & Showbiz 'we're still in love!'

Sharonville residents honored by Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur 12:18 p.m. EDT October 5, 2016 The Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur presented Sharonville residents Patti and Keith Hanley with their Hearts as Wide as the World Award at their September Friends Appreciation Dinner. (Photo: Provided) The Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur presented Sharonville residents Patti and Keith Hanley with their Hearts as Wide as the World Award at their September Friends Appreciation Dinner. Both Hanleys participate in the Associates Program of the sisters, which is comprised of lay community members who work to further the sisters’ mission of education and service to people who are marginalized. Of particular interest to the Hanleys has been the sisters’ Photovoltaic Learning Lab at their Reading convent. The Learning Lab serves as a prototype for photovoltaic systems in Africa that provide electricity and clean water to the hospitals, clinics and schools where the sisters work. The Lab is staffed by area high school students who test the hardware, generate electricity to purify water, determine cost/benefit ratios for various equipment, etc..., all while simulating African climate conditions. The Hanleys were instrumental in establishing the Learning Lab and continue to serve as advisors for the teachers, students and Sisters of Notre Dame using it. Keith Hanley is a retired engineer from Procter & Gamble. Patti Hanley also works with the Sisters in their efforts to raise awareness in local schools regarding clean water, particularly as it relates to the lives of people in the developing world. Two of the Hanleys four children attended Mount Notre Dame High School, a school established by the sisters. “We honor Keith and Patti because they are truly our friends,” says Sister Mary Ann Barnhorn, the sisters’ director of development. “They are our friends personally and they are our friends, our partners, in the work we do in Cincinnati and around the world.” The Hearts as Wide as the World Award is so named because of the instruction given to the sisters by their foundress more than 200 years ago. “Our charity must not be limited by the love we have for one another,” St. Julie Billiart said. “It must make our hearts as wide as the world.” Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2e2iTSm TOP VIDEOS Joe Deters: "I didn't believe the tears for a second" 2:47 Are deals better on Black Friday or Cyber Monday? 1:00 Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 Predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 Student at UC Tensing forum: 'It's time for war' 0:45 Sam DuBose sister: 'This, to me, is murder' 1:30 Protests in Cincinnati after Ray Tensing mistrial 1:09 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Mistrial declared in Ray Tensing case 3:46 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 Use-of-force expert: 'The actions of Ray Tensing were justified' 0:50

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Oct 5, 2016 at 8:25AM In this segment of the Sept. 22 MarketFoolery podcast, Chris Hill and Bill Barker of Motley Fool Funds discuss whether the market is being too negative about the parent of chains Ann Taylor, Justice, Dress Barn, and Lane Bryant, among others. The whole industry is suffering from macro headwinds, but where do they go from here?   A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Sept. 22, 2016. Chris Hill: Ascena Retail is having a bad week, shares down around 30 percent. This is the parent company of Lane Bryant, Dress Barn, Justice, Catherines, and Maurices. With the exception of Lane Bryant, I believe that all of those retail outlets are showing declining sales, and yet, 30 percent? That seems like a hell of a haircut for this stock. Bill Barker: Yeah. This stock has seen a lot of trouble over the years. It's really not delivered much to shareholders. I guess prior to coming into that -- look retail has been challenging, clothing retail has been challenging. This store has never really delivered to shareholders and so more people found the exit again because of it. The declines were 4 percent at Justice -- this is the same-store sales declines for the quarter -- 4 percent at Justice, 9 percent at Maurice's, 7 percent at Dress Barn, 5 percent at Catherine's. Ann Taylor was going to be around 5 percent, 6 percent. That's pretty thorough, that's pretty across the board. You can say that there are macroeconomic factors, you can say the company is obviously not getting it right when there are declines everywhere to that degree. I would say that- So Maurice's was down the most, 9 percent. That's really not too much of a surprise because it's a sort of a small-town-oriented, Midwest, middle-of-the-country brand. That is where more of the economic problems in the country are right now. Chris: If you're Ascena, do you need to think about, I don't know, getting rid of one of these brands? I don't know. Maybe that's too simplistic, but it seems like they've got a bunch ... We've seen this with other businesses. We've seen this with large conglomerates like Procter & Gamble, Colgate, Palmolive. In those cases you're talking about a business that has 75 to 100 different brands and business lines underneath it and they look to shed some here and there. We've also seen it with a company like Darden Restaurants, which owns Olive Garden and The Capital Grille and that sort of thing, and then got rid of Red Lobster because they just thought, you know what we got to focus here. I'm wondering if at least part of the solution for Ascena Retail Group is to take one or possibly more of these brands and say, you know what, we're going to be a better operator if we're more focused on fewer brands. Bill: I think they probably should consider that. I'm not going to answer as to whether that would definitely be the right thing to do because I don't know. Frankly when you and I discuss women's retail, we're definitionally way over our heads. Chris: Yes. Bill: For us to tackle men's fashion is probably not a fair fight there. Women's is just ... Chris: Right. Bill: Who are these clowns? Chris: Exactly. Bill: That said, they're going the opposite way of what you suggest might be something to think about. They just acquired Ann Taylor. The Ann Taylor numbers, because it hasn't been part of the company for a full year yet, aren't baked into that full company comp decline. They're acquiring, that's what this company historically has done. They have grown by getting more brands, they haven't grown shareholder rewards so maybe it is time to look at hey if you're empire building, great for you. If you're CEO and now your compensation is based on more sales, more employees, whatever, maybe that's only working out for you. Maybe that's not how the CEO's compensation works out, I don't know, but the shareholders are entitled to look at the business plan and say, maybe you're not executing on our behalf.

Shots Studios rebrands from selfie app to social star video factory Posted Oct 5, 2016 by Josh Constine (@joshconstine), Katie Roof (@Katie_Roof) 0 SHARES Next Story InkHunter’s AR tattoo app exits beta on Android as startup looks to wider, B2B play Twitter once tried to buy Shots for $150 million to score its 3 million rabid teen users, a source tells TechCrunch. But the Justin Bieber-funded selfie app developer dreamed of a different destiny, where it would become the “Saturday Night Live” of the mobile generation. The Shots app grew to a peak of almost 8 million users, but ultimately it was too difficult to compete with Instagram and Snapchat. Despite a shift to comedy and acquisitions like lo-fi video capture app Camcorder and music video maker Mindie, the Shots team decided they were better off as a content creator. Social media stars from Vine, Instagram and Snapchat befriended the startup. The Bieber affiliation gave it credibility, and co-founder John Shahidi’s “I’m on the creator’s side” stance fostered trust with multi-million view video makers like Lele Pons and Rudy Mancuso. Shahidi discovered that as long as these web celebs kept pumping out funny skits, their fans would follow them from one social media platform to the next. So over the past few months, Shots has rebranded as Shots Studios, and turned its focus from apps to the content people share on them. It’s taken stars who built their fame in still Instagrams, 6-second Vines and off-the-cuff Snapchat clips, and helped them shoot high-production four-minute YouTube videos. The result? Millions of views per video, strong ad revenue and, according to a source close to the company, sudden partnership interest from Facebook, Netflix and Verizon that could potentially spill into acquisition talks. With the help of Shots Studios, former Vine star Lele Pons racks up millions of views on her YouTube videosShots has now signed deals with social stars Lele Pons, Rudy Mancuso and his show Awkward Puppets and Anwar Jabawi. They have exclusive deals with Shots which takes a revenue cut of their earnings that John Shahidi wouldn’t specify but that he called “creator friendly”. In exchange, creators get access to a production team including a film crew, writers, and editors; brand management; sales help; and access to Shots’ data and growth teams. While the startup declined to comment on specific discussions, Shots Studios insists that they are not focused on selling the company right now. Their new business model has been building momentum and the company is a few months away from profitability, due to ads and partnerships with Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola and American Express. Shots will still run its app, but the team is concentrating on video production and distribution. Related Articles More Than A Selfie App, Shots Produces Original Videos With Puppets (And Bieber) Shots acquires Mindie to build a teen video app empire Justin Bieber-Backed "Shots Of Me" Launches Selfie Sharing App Content creation has become a growing business, with mobile video consumption skyrocketing in the past few years thanks to better cameras, screens and wireless networks. Advertisers are looking to reach these viewers, particularly in the young demographic that Shots caters to, and video ads pay much more than their annoying banner cousins. If executed correctly, Shots’ plan could ultimately lead to a big exit for the company. Maker Studios was acquired by Disney for more than $500 million. Fullscreen also found a lucrative outcome.  Anything at or above that original $150 million price Twitter dangled would be a big win for Shots’ investors. It has raised $15 million in funding; investors include 500 Startups, Floyd Mayweather and Major League Baseball. And Shots’ most famous investor, Justin Bieber, is more involved than ever. The star got his own start on YouTube and we’re told that he’s very enthusiastic about helping the next generation of artists. And that concept of creating as a team could be Shots’ greatest strength. Each of its affiliated stars do cameos in each others’ videos and cross-promote them to their own fans. That strategy let the Shots family of stars become the oligarchy ruling Vine’s Popular page. Now the startup will give them the spotlight for a lot longer than six seconds. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Shots Studios Founded 2013 Overview Shots Studios is a data-driven entertainment company that creates comedy sketches and music for Millennials.

Earlier this month, Maruti Suzuki India had announced that its total sales jumped 31.1% to 1.49 lakh units in September 2016 over September 2015. Domestic sales surged 29.4% to 1.37 lakh units in September 2016 over September 2015. Exports jumped 54% to 11,822 units in September 2016 over September 2015. Capital goods stocks were also mixed. Bharat Heavy Electricals (Bhel) (down 1.38%), Havells India (down 0.54%), and ABB India (down 0.1%) declined. Bharat Electronics (up 0.2%), L&T (up 0.41%), Thermax (up 2.59%), and Siemens (up 0.17%) gained. Alembic Pharmaceuticals rose 3.32% after the company said that its formulation facility located at Panelav in Gujarat has received Establishment Inspection Report (EIR) from US Food & Drug Administration (USFDA) for the inspection carried out by them in March 2016. The announcement was made during trading hours today, 5 October 2016. Motherson Sumi Systems rose 0.96% on reports that a foreign brokerage has initiated coverage on the stock with a buy rating. The foreign brokerage reportedly said that the passenger vehicle recovery would drive domestic business for Motherson Sumi Systems. The company's strong order book offers visibility on overseas business, it added. Motherson's FY 2019 earnings per share (EPS) estimates are 12% ahead of consensus, it further added. The brokerage sees further value-accretion for the company through acquisitions. On macro front, data showed today, 5 October 2016, that the health of the Indian private sector economy improved in September, but to a lesser extent than in August. Output and new business increased at softer rates in both the manufacturing and service sectors. Meanwhile, prices charged were raised in line with higher cost burdens. Reflecting softer expansions in activity at both service providers and manufacturers, the seasonally adjusted Nikkei India Composite PMI Output Index fell from August's 42-month high of 54.6 to 52.4 in September. Nonetheless, the latest above-50 reading was the fifteenth in as many months, highlighting ongoing growth in the country. The headline seasonally adjusted Nikkei India Services Business Activity Index registered 52 in September down from August's 43-month high of 54.7, thus the latest reading pointing to a slower rate of expansion that was moderate overall. Global economic growth will remain subdued this year following a slowdown in the United States and Britain's vote to leave the European Union, the IMF said in its October 2016 World Economic Outlook yesterday, 4 October 2016. The world economy will expand 3.1% this year, the IMF said, unchanged from its July projection. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised India's growth forecast a tad, citing the resilience of its economy and robust growth momentum. The IMF now expects the economy to expand 7.6% in 2016-17, up from its earlier projection of 7.4%.

A contributor of Forbes, Kimberly A. Whitler, PhD, University of Virginia Darden School of Business asked herself the very same question, and when she couldn’t find any such data, she partnered with Christine DeYoung, partner at DHR International, a leading senior-level executive search, management assessment and succession planning company, to survey executive recruiters who specially place C-level marketers. Their 2016 top 20 list includes 11 CG companies, with P&G at the very top; the second and third spot belong to PepsiCo and Unilever. Here is the full list, as published in Forbes: Best Companies for MBA Marketing Students: Procter & Gamble PepsiCo Unilever Google American Express Coca-Cola General Mills Amazon Apple Starbucks Nike Target Kellogg’s KraftHeinz/Mondelez Macy’s Clorox Johnson & Johnson Verizon Facebook McKinsey & Co./Nestle The survey highlighted that the companies that continually breed and turn out top marketing talent have a few things in common:  1) they invest in their people heavily: training, exposure, and cross-functionally; 2) they invest heavily in Strategic Marketing because they believe in its power to drive results; and 3) “Marketers” are synonymous with general managers versus marketing communication experts. The top marketing companies also teach and expect their brand marketers to holistically drive the P&L, which ultimately is what creates more capable, enterprise-wide leaders, according to DeYoung. In total, the 2016 survey includes executive recruiter responses who represent 19 different firms (including boutique, mid-sized, and large recruiting firms) and have placed over 2600 C-level marketing leaders over the course of their careers.

Anorak Anorak | Manchester United career not enough for Ryan Giggs to land Swansea job Menu Home News Politics Madeleine McCann Strange But True Celebs Film Music TV & Radio Fashion Tech Cars Money The Consumer Sport Flashback Photos Home News Politics Madeleine McCann Strange But True Entertainment Celebs Film Music TV & Radio Life Fashion Tech Cars Money The Consumer Sport Flashback Photos Manchester United career not enough for Ryan Giggs to land Swansea job by Anorak | 4th, October 2016 When Swansea sacked head coach Francesco Guidolin on his 61st birthday too, the British Press all tipped former Manchester United player Ryan Giggs to replace him. Daily Mail columnist Jamie Redknapp said he’d be “amazed” if Giggs didn’t get the job. Giggs didn’t get the job. Swansea’s US-based owners Steve Kaplan, Jason Levein and chairman Huw Jenkins appointed former USA coach Bob Bradley, who leaves Ligue 2 side Le Havre. Bradley was chosen for his “experience and character”. He is the first American coach to work in the Premier League. Giggs, says the Mail, failed his interview. The paper says Giggs “was confident of landing his first permanent post having held an interview with Swans chairman Huw Jenkins last week.” The owners had “concerns about his lack of experience and an underwhelming interview scuppered Giggs’s chances”. Giggs – who has worked as Louis Van Gaal’s Number 2 coach at Manchester United, for whom he played 672 times – lacked experience. Bradley – who never played professionally and has managed the Princeton Tigers, Chicago Fire, Egypt and the USA – has the better CV. It’s not hard to imagine that Bradley, who went to Princeton University and worked in the Procter & Gamble’s executive training program, was better in interview than Giggs, especially those parts when they fire question, like ‘What is 10 per cent of £12.50’ and ‘Can Swansea build a franchise in the USA – discuss?’ and ‘Is it ever OK to high-five a player after-scoring a goal?’ In May 2016, thy Times wrote, “Giggs as Manchester United manager? It will happen one day if he waits patiently enough, rather than risking his reputation elsewhere.” Last questions: Was missing out on the Swansea job a lucky escape?

Stocks close lower after US economic data; real estate lags CNBC 10/3/2016 Fred Imbert Click to expand Replay Video Trump rode $5 billion in free media to the White House Donald Trump didn't spend nearly as much on advertising as typical presidential candidates, and he didn't have to -- he relied on billions of dollars of free mentions in media ranging from major TV news networks to Buzzfeed and Twitter instead. The real estate magnate got $4.96 billion in free earned media in the year leading up to the presidential election, according to data from tracking firm mediaQuant. Over the past 12 months, the president-elect received more than $800 million in free earned broadcast media, compared to $666 million for Clinton, and $2.6 billion in free earned online news attention, compared to $1.6 billion for his rival. He edged out her and other major political names in American and worldwide newspapers as well.

Non of the news we've gotten have been terribly encouraging," said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. "Some sort of corrective action, given the [high] valuations wouldn't be surprising and would be healthy for the market." Quotes in the article Henderson Group PLC HNDGF ▲ 2.96 +0.22 +8.03% Deutsche Bank AG DB ▼ 15.89 -0.20 -1.24% The Dow Jones industrial average fell about 100 points in midmorning trade before holding about 60 points lower, with Travelers Companies and UnitedHealth Group contributing the most losses. "The auto sales data were not great," said Chuck Self, CIO at iSectors. "The manufacturing data were not great, either. They're higher, but not running away. I think a lot of this has to do with rally we had Friday." The S&P 500 fell 0.48 percent, with real estate falling more than 1.5 percent to lead decliners. "Things seem to be quiet at the moment. October is usually a rough month for stocks. i guess we're getting a bit of a kickback from Friday, said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Service. The Nasdaq composite slid approximately 0.4 percent. "For me, it could be the return of overbought conditions on Friday. We had a pretty strong session on Friday and that supports a pullback today," said Katie Stockton, chief technical strategist at BTIG. She added, however, that overall short-term momentum remains strong, and that the S&P could break above its all-time intraday high of 2,193.81. "It's a minor level because it hasn't been tested that much. Technical levels are stronger the more you test them," Stockton said. Stocks ended the third quarter on a high note on Friday, rising around 1 percent. In economic news, the September Markit Manufacturing PMI came in at 51.5, a three-month low. "U.S. manufacturers signalled another moderate upturn in both production volumes and incoming new work during September, but the latest survey indicated a further loss of growth momentum from July's recent peak," Markit said. The ISM Manufacturing index for September came in at 51.5, up from 49.4 in the previous month. Construction spending fell 0.7 percent in August, with analysts expecting a 0.2 percent increase. "The market, I think, is becoming more accepting of the fact that [Federal Reserve Chair] Janet Yellen wants to raise interest rates in December," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "But you need the market to be underpinned by growth." "The ISM number came above consensus, and that's positive," she said. Also, Nissan reported its U.S. auto sales rose 4.9 percent in September, beating expectations. Ford reported a sales fall of 8 percent, still better than the expected 8.5 percent. Toyota sales, meanwhile, missed estimates, rising 1.5 percent. General Motors sales fell 0.6 percent, less than expected. Other vehicle sales for September will be released throughout the day. Crude prices rose broadly, with U.S. oil futures settling 1.2 percent higher at $48.81 per barrel, supported by a planned production cut by exporter group OPEC, although analysts cautioned a stubborn supply overhang could temper a longer-lasting rally. Brent prices broke above $50, hitting their highest level since August. The OPEC deal is expected to take effect in November. "If we get a production cut, even if it's small, or even a production freeze, that's the best news we've gotten over the past two years," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. Overseas, European stocks closed mostly flat as investors kept an eye on Deutsche Bank and the U.K. process to leave the European Union. On Friday, U.S. equities had closed sharply higher amid a report that Deutsche Bank was near a settlement with the Justice Department. However, U.S.-listed shares traded 1.9 percent lower Monday with no official deal being announced between Deutsche Bank and the DOJ. British Prime Minister Theresa May said Sunday she'd start the Brexit process in the early part of 2017, a process which is expected to take about two years to complete. The British pound fell about 1 percent against the dollar on Monday, trading at $1.286. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar rose 0.24 percent, with the euro near $1.122 and the yen around 101.54. U.S. Treasurys were mostly lower, with the two-year note yield at 0.794 percent and the benchmark 10-year note yield around 1.62 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 60 points, or 0.35 percent, to 18,244, with Procter & Gamble leading decliners and DuPont the top advancer. The S&P 500 fell 9 points, or 0.42 percent, to 2,159, with utilities all sectors lower. The Nasdaq slid 16 points, or 0.31 percent, to trade at 5,295. About nine stocks declined for every five advancers at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 497 million and a composite volume of 2.324 billion in afternoon trade. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded near 13.8. Gold futures for December delivery fell $4.40 to settle at $1,312.70 per ounce. —CNBC's Matt Clinch and Reuters contributed to this report. On tap this week: *Planner subject to change.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 4 October 2016 | MYT 7:41 AM Wall St dips in slow start to fourth quarter NEW YORK: The fourth quarter got off to a weak start for U.S. stock investors on Monday, with financials, consumer staples and utilities pulling the S&P 500 lower. Major indexes have bounced between gains and losses in the past few days, with investors nervous about the outcome of a tight race for the White House ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Big banks extended recent declines as investors worried about the stability of Deutsche Bank and also Wells Fargo & Co's handling of sales abuses. U.S-listed shares of Deutsche slipped 0.85 percent as hopes faded of a swift deal with U.S. authorities over a multi-billion dollar penalty for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities. "The feeling is there will be a negotiation lowering that penalty but it's certainly a bit of an overhang on the overall market," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. The S&P 500 financial index declined 0.43 percent as Wells Fargo slid 1.02 percent to its lowest since December 2013. Also weighing on investor sentiment was a plan announced by Britain on Sunday to start its separation from the European Union by March. With yields on U.S. Treasury bonds up following stronger-than-expected U.S. manufacturing data for September, the interest-rate sensitive utility sector fell 1.35 percent. The consumer staples index declined 0.6 percent, with Procter & Gamble falling 1.21 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3 percent to end the session at 18,253.85 points and the S&P 500 lost 0.33 percent to 2,161.2. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.21 percent to 5,300.87 points. About 5.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, well below the 7.1 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. S&P 500 companies on average are expected to posts a 0.5 percent dip in third-quarter earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data. That would mark a fifth straight quarter of year-over-year earnings declines, in large part due to weak oil prices. Tesla Motors jumped 4.74 percent after the electric carmaker said third-quarter deliveries rose by 70 percent to 24,500 cars. Cabela's surged 15.02 percent after the retailer said it would be acquired by Bass Pro Shops in a deal valued at about $5.5 billion. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.40-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.40-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 77 new highs and 32 new lows. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Corporate News , Markets , Oil & Gas You May Be Interested Snap's youthful founders show no fear in race to IPO Wall street stocks lifted by data, earnings Yellen remarks Tanah Makmur shareholders approve proposed SCR Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official China badminton star Lin Dan apologises for affair with model while wife was pregnant Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot The Star's executive editor Soo Ewe Jin passes away Property Related advertisement Latest News Opec moves closer to oil output deal as Iran gets new offer Wall St flat at the open; Nasdaq hits record high Prestariang wins RM3.5bil deal to revamp Immigration’s IT system Musa tables RM3.78bil surplus budget for Sabah SC appoints Gumuri as AOB executive chairman Most Viewed in Business Ringgit continues slide Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot Prestariang wins RM3.5bil deal to revamp Immigration’s IT system SC appoints Gumuri as AOB executive chairman Musa tables RM3.78bil surplus budget for Sabah Ringgit opens lower against US dollar Prince Alwaleed sees Saudi currency depeg as last resort MDEC and UOA Holdings to set up gaming hub Ringgit, KLCI continue to fall advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Soap and detergent maker Henkel tests products at this facility in Scottsdale. (Photo: John Samora/The Republic) Story Highlights Arizona will lose roughly 375 jobs as soap/detergent maker Henkel moves an operation from Scottsdale The German firm will combine the operation with Sun Products, which it acquired this year The move severs a connection with one of Arizona's hallmark companies, the Dial Corp. The German parent of an Arizona company that makes soaps and detergents plans to consolidate the unit's operations in Connecticut, closing its operations in Scottsdale over the next year and a half. The move will end Arizona's historic connection to Dial soaps. Roughly 375 people work in the Scottsdale office of Henkel AG. Those employees will be offered the chance to relocate, the company said. The German company makes Dial soaps, Persil and Purex laundry detergents, Right Guard antiperspirants, beauty products, adhesives and other items. The Scottsdale office tests products, conducts market research and performs other tasks but doesn't manufacture. Henkel, which employs about 50,000 people worldwide, bought the operation when it acquired Dial Corp. in 2004. An article last year in The Arizona Republic examined the Scottsdale facility and its people in more detail.

The move will start in either the second or third quarters of 2017 and conclude in early 2018. Henkel said the move "represents the next step toward fully integrating Henkel and Sun operations." Sun makes products include Sun and Snuggle. The combination makes Henkel the No. 2 company behind Procter & Gamble in the U.S. laundry business. Relocating to Connecticut brings Henkel's consumer  businesses closer to other company operations in the eastern U.S. and to its North American headquarters in Rocky Hill, Conn. Henkel, headquartered in Dusseldorf, was founded in 1876, and its flagship Persil detergent dates to 1907. Dial soap products evolved in the 1940s in Chicago under meatpacker Armour & Co., as tallow used in soap was a byproduct of meatpacking. A separate entity, bus company Greyhound Corp., bought Armour in 1970 and moved to Phoenix the following year. After the company exited the transportation business in the 1980s, it changed its name to the Dial Corp., in 1991. Five years after that, the company split in two, with Dial and its consumer products going one way and a new corporation, Viad, going another. Viad, which offers marketing/events services and those geared to travel/recreation, remains an independent company still headquartered in Phoenix.

A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Here's a look at longtime Arizona businesses that have closed recently.  The Republic Fullscreen ED DEBEVIC'S: Ed Debevic's was another family favorite, near 20th Street and Highland Avenue. Sassy waitresses served burgers and meatloaf at the retro-style diner through the '80s and '90s. The jukebox, photos and snarky neon signs went to auction when the diner closed in the early 2000s.  Jack Kurtz/The Republic Fullscreen CHOCOLATES BY BERNARD CALLEBAUT: Master chocolatier Bernard Callebaut first brought his exquisite confections to Arizona in 1996, when he opened a store in Scottsdale's Hilton Village. More Valley stores followed. The Chandler store closed in 2004, and the rest of the chocolates began to disappear from Arizona.  Emmanuel Lozano/The Republic Fullscreen SCOTTSDALE 6 DRIVE-IN: This drive-in was demolished in 2014, years after it shut down. It was the latest in a string of drive-in movie theatres to close, the result of changing habits and tastes among movie-goers. The Phoenix area used to be dotted with the outdoor screens. A partial list of names: Big Sky, Pioneer, Nu View and the Thunderbird. One drive-in theater still exists: The WestWind Glendale 9 on 55th Avenue, south of Bethany Home Road.  David Kadlubowski/The Republic Fullscreen VIDEO PARADISE: Video Paradise, at Alma School and Warner roads in Chandler, is from a bygone era, when video stores were a hot weekend stop for people of all ages and the wait for a new release created some buzz. It closed at the end of January 2016 after 25 years, according to the owner.  Chris Coppola Fullscreen MY FLORIST: This bakery, sandwich shop and wine bar was one of the first of the new wave of restaurants in the central Phoenix area when it opened in 1996. It offered a pricey, but delicious, peanut butter sandwich and offered a white wine with which to pair it. The piano performances by Nicole Pesce would delight crowds. It closed suddenly in 2010. More eateries had filed into downtown by then. The iconic sign was left over from when the building did house a florist beginning in 1947. Below it now is a chain hamburger restaurant.  The Republic Fullscreen DOWNTOWN DELI : A longtime fixture in downtown Phoenix, the Downtown Deli shuttered its doors on May 22, 2015. The deli was known for its Skyscraper sandwich with corned beef piled high with pastrami and Swiss cheese. Glenn Schultz, who owned the deli with wife Trish, said the landlord raised the rent, forcing the business to close. But, there's hope. Schultz said they're hoping to relocate the business somewhere else downtown.  Downtown Deli Fullscreen BIG APPLE: Bill Johnson's Big Apple, a 59-year icon at 3757 E. Van Buren St., closed May 24, 2015. The Phoenix restaurant was the last remaining in a chain that once had seven locations. The eatery was known for its Western decor and sawdust on the floor. The waitresses wore cowboy hats on their heads and toy six-shooters on their hips.  Michael Chow/The Republic Fullscreen HARKINS CAMELVIEW 5: After a 42-year run as one of the Valley's preeminent movie theaters, Harkins Camelview 5 in Scottsdale closed in December 2015, replaced by a new 14-screen cinema next door at Scottsdale Fashion Square mall.

Johnson/The Republic Fullscreen LEGEND CITY: The memories of this amusement park are better than the reality. Envisioned as an Old West theme park, it quickly devolved into a carnival on an asphalt lot. The economic reality was it was too hot for an amusement parks during Phoenix summers and winter evenings didn’t generate enough business.  The Republic Fullscreen A-1 BEER: There was a time when every city had its own breweries, and A-1 was the major player in Phoenix. It was later bought by a larger national brewery and the quality slipped a bit. If you remembered the brand from the 50s, when it was the “Western way to say welcome,” you thought of a crisp pilsner. Those who remember the canned beer from the 70s, have less fond memories.  David Wallace/The Republic Fullscreen BLAKELY'S: Blakely's was a string of service stations through the Phoenix area. Attendants in white uniforms would pump gas, fill up tires and check oil. Patrons were either given a free glass, or a receipt slip that could be saved and redeemed for dinnerware. The glasses, which were painted with cactuses, have become collectibles. The chain started in 1937. It was bought by Gulf Oil in 1963.  The Republic Fullscreen KARSH'S BAKERY: This venerable kosher bakery fell victim to the times. It could not compete with high volume bakeries and increasing rents. It closed in March 2014, ending nearly 50 years in business. On its last day, there were lines around the block. Owners said at the time they hoped to find a smaller, more affordable location and re-open.  Stacie Scott/The Republic Fullscreen HANNY'S: Back when Phoenix residents went downtown to buy clothes, this was one of the department stores of choice. Shopping districts moved to malls and power centers in farther-flung areas. Hanny’s sturdy concrete structure stood vacant for years. The fire department would set it on fire for structure practice. But it has been reinvented and occupied as a wine bar and restaurant since 2008. Patrons can stand over the old elevator shaft. Names of clothing brands still decorate the walls.  Markow Photography Fullscreen CINE CAPRI: Blakely's was a string of service stations through the Phoenix area.

Employees helped landscape countless Phoenix-area homes. And provided a bit of free gardening advice or whimsey with rotating series of signs along 40th Street. In 2006, the namesake signed the business over to his daughters, who closed it in late 2014.  The Republic Fullscreen DOWNTOWN DELI : A longtime fixture in downtown Phoenix, the Downtown Deli shuttered its doors on May 22, 2015. The deli was known for its Skyscraper sandwich with corned beef piled high with pastrami and Swiss cheese. Glenn Schultz, who owned the deli with wife Trish, said the landlord raised the rent, forcing the business to close. But, there's hope. Schultz said they're hoping to relocate the business somewhere else downtown.  Downtown Deli Fullscreen PINNACLE PEAK PATIO: Pinnacle Peak Patio in Scottsdale closed on June 28, 2015. Generations of visitors, hankering for an Old West experience, set foot in the dusty wooden establishment, known for its 2-pound porterhouse steaks and of neckties hanging from the ceiling.  Michael Schennum/The Republic Fullscreen HENKEL AG: Henkel, parent company of the Dial Corp., announced in October 2016 that it was shuttering its Scottsdale, Arizona, offices.

Arizona lost roughly 375 jobs. Henkel acquired the Dial Corp., formally one of Arizona's largest corporations, in December 2004 for $2.9 billion.  John Samora/The Republic Fullscreen Like this topic?
