FUER DEN INHALT IST ALLEIN DAS BERICHTENDE UNTERNEHMEN VERANTWORTLICH. In partnership with UNESCO and Save the Children, P&G and its Always feminine care brand help rebuild the confidence of girls impacted by the Syrian crisis through education and skill development. DAVOS, Switzerland --(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 17.01.2017 -- Today, Procter & Gamble and global feminine care leader, Always, announce a new commitment to address the challenges girls and young women are facing due to the effects of the Syrian refugee crisis. In partnership with UNESCO and Save the Children, they will help rebuild the confidence of girls in Jordan through education and skill development. Today’s commitment furthers the Always brand’s mission of championing girls’ confidence and a world free from gender bias. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170117006529/en/ Marking the launch of this new commitment during a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, P&G and Always brought together international experts and leading figures to discuss solutions to securing the future of young women through education and skill development within the context of the current refugee crisis. Participants included Carolyn Tastad, Gender Equality Executive Sponsor and Group President of North America, P&G, Gülser Corat, Director of the Division for Gender Equality, UNESCO, Lliam Findlay, Policy and Advocacy Adviser to the CEO, Save the Children and Maurice Levy, CEO, Publicis Groupe. A large number of Syrian refugees, especially girls, are no longer attending school. Adolescent girls entering puberty or going through their early teenage years are particularly at risk. Their bodies are changing and the support they might usually receive from their families may no longer be available, resulting in a loss of confidence and them being left out of school and education. Additionally, many young women affected by the refugee crisis are unable to work and provide income for their families, lacking access to training and facing gender-based barriers that keep them at home. P&G and Always are working to stop this, rooted in the belief that education is key to empowering girls and young women so they are confident, skilled, strong and equipped to take charge of their future even in the most challenging circumstances. It’s well-documented that when girls and women thrive, families are healthier and communities are stronger. This new commitment in Jordan builds on the Always’ 30-year heritage of providing puberty and confidence education to more than 17 million girls around the world every year, and furthers P&G’s focus on and commitment to gender equality. It extends our existing partnership with UNESCO which has provided much-needed support to girls in Senegal and Nigeria to help them stay in school. This new initiative with UNESCO focuses on reaching young Syrian and Jordanian women, who have encountered significant challenges with continuing and completing basic education or pursuing training opportunities. The programme provides these young, at-risk women with life-skills and work readiness training, whilst encouraging shared experiences and an open dialogue between Syrians and Jordanians. It is designed to help the young women develop business and vocational skills to realise their potential. Always are also supporting a second programme with Save the Children; which expands our collective work, focused on helping thousands of adolescent South African and Nigerian girls stay in school. This programme provides homebound girls with life skills and educates their parents on the importance of supporting their daughters through puberty. The programme also involves local community support through formal and non-formal education, either in local schools or home-school efforts. Removing social and family barriers is important to ensuring girls have the confidence to grow and thrive. That’s why these efforts include training and education of parents and community members on topics including girls’ right to education, the role of women in society, and the importance of gender equality. The programmes aim to reach around 1000 girls and young women. Carolyn Tastad, Gender Equality Executive Sponsor and Group President of North America, P&G adds: “At P&G, we believe girls and women are a force for positive change in the world. Growing their knowledge and skills builds confidence and unleashes their full potential and power. Our commitment today as P&G and through our Always brand contributes to our aspiration to build a better world for all of us — a world free of gender bias." Those who want to support this commitment can donate to UNESCO and Save the Children funds, which will allow them to reach more girls and women with life-changing support.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Jan 17, 2017 at 4:19PM Consumer goods giant Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) will announce its fourth-quarter results before the market opens on Tuesday, Jan. 24. The stock underperformed the market and global rival Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) in 2016 as sales growth ground to a halt. But will the owner of the Huggies diapers and Kleenex tissue brands have more bad news for shareholders to kick off the new fiscal year? Below are a few critical trends for investors to watch in the upcoming report. Organic growth Kimberly-Clark's last quarterly outing showed evidence of a sharp growth slowdown as sales volume dove from 4% in the prior quarter to just 0%. Organic sales, the company's single most important metric, fell to 0% from 3%. Image source: Kimberly-Clark. Some of that slump can be tied to the weak sales environment that's keeping the entire industry at near zero growth. However, competitive threats are also taking their toll. Procter & Gamble competes with Kimberly-Clark's Huggies brand, and the consumer products titan saw its volume trends improve over the past quarter, as its Pampers market share lead hit a new high. Thanks to both increased competition and softening demand, Kimberly-Clark dialed back its full-year sales growth outlook to just 2%. That's far from the 3% to 5% gains that CEO Tom Falk and his executive team originally projected, and it's even below the 3% that they were targeting as recently as the second quarter. Hitting that lowered goal won't be enough to hint at a business rebound, though. Within the organic sales growth figures, investors should keep an eye on the balance of volume and pricing contributions. Ideally, Kimberly-Clark will show volume-driven growth while at least keeping its average prices unchanged. If instead volume is flat and the company relies only on price boosts to raise revenue, that's an indication that growth is fragile and not likely to quickly recover its prior 4% pace. Profits and cash Kimberly-Clark's financial wins keep piling up despite the weak sales growth pace, and investors will want to see more progress there. Gross and operating profit margins both improved last quarter, thanks mainly to an expense-cutting initiative that is removing $375 million from annual costs. That's the key reason why even with a lower revenue base, the company managed to generate $836 million of operating profit last quarter, up from $779 million in the prior year. KMB Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YCharts. Kimberly-Clark is also producing plenty of cash, with operating cash jumping 12% to $950 million at the last quarterly checkup. Return on invested capital is on the rise too and running well ahead of management's goal. The company can't do much about a weakening industry or rising competitive threats, but executives do have the power to keep earnings -- and cash returns to shareholders -- rising through continued improvements on the efficiency side of the business. The rebound plan At this time last year, Kimberly-Clark issued what turned out to be an overly optimistic annual growth forecast that executives had to dial back twice during the year. Another quarter of weak volume gains could convince the company to stay conservative for its 2017 outlook, though. If it hits its full-year goal of 2% organic growth, Kimberly-Clark will be entering the new fiscal year at about the same pace as Procter & Gamble, but also at just half the level it enjoyed in fiscal 2015. Shareholders can be sure that a disappointing forecast like that would come with a detailed plan to recover momentum. Any rebound initiatives would likely include stepped-up cost-cutting and efficiency moves but also might venture into more aggressive actions, like the brand-shedding process that P&G just concluded.

In partnership with UNESCO and Save the Children, they will help rebuild the confidence of girls in Jordan through education and skill development. Today’s commitment furthers the Always brand’s mission of championing girls’ confidence and a world free from gender bias. Marking the launch of this new commitment during a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, P&G and Always brought together international experts and leading figures to discuss solutions to securing the future of young women through education and skill development within the context of the current refugee crisis. Participants included Carolyn Tastad, Gender Equality Executive Sponsor and Group President of North America, P&G, Gülser Corat, Director of the Division for Gender Equality, UNESCO, Lliam Findlay, Policy and Advocacy Adviser to the CEO, Save the Children and Maurice Levy, CEO, Publicis Groupe. A large number of Syrian refugees, especially girls, are no longer attending school. Adolescent girls entering puberty or going through their early teenage years are particularly at risk. Their bodies are changing and the support they might usually receive from their families may no longer be available, resulting in a loss of confidence and them being left out of school and education. Additionally, many young women affected by the refugee crisis are unable to work and provide income for their families, lacking access to training and facing gender-based barriers that keep them at home. P&G and Always are working to stop this, rooted in the belief that education is key to empowering girls and young women so they are confident, skilled, strong and equipped to take charge of their future even in the most challenging circumstances. It’s well-documented that when girls and women thrive, families are healthier and communities are stronger. This new commitment in Jordan builds on the Always’ 30-year heritage of providing puberty and confidence education to more than 17 million girls around the world every year, and furthers P&G’s focus on and commitment to gender equality. It extends our existing partnership with UNESCO which has provided much-needed support to girls in Senegal and Nigeria to help them stay in school. This new initiative with UNESCO focuses on reaching young Syrian and Jordanian women, who have encountered significant challenges with continuing and completing basic education or pursuing training opportunities. The programme provides these young, at-risk women with life-skills and work readiness training, whilst encouraging shared experiences and an open dialogue between Syrians and Jordanians. It is designed to help the young women develop business and vocational skills to realise their potential. Always are also supporting a second programme with Save the Children; which expands our collective work, focused on helping thousands of adolescent South African and Nigerian girls stay in school. This programme provides homebound girls with life skills and educates their parents on the importance of supporting their daughters through puberty. The programme also involves local community support through formal and non-formal education, either in local schools or home-school efforts. Removing social and family barriers is important to ensuring girls have the confidence to grow and thrive. That’s why these efforts include training and education of parents and community members on topics including girls’ right to education, the role of women in society, and the importance of gender equality. The programmes aim to reach around 1000 girls and young women. Carolyn Tastad, Gender Equality Executive Sponsor and Group President of North America, P&G adds: “At P&G, we believe girls and women are a force for positive change in the world. Growing their knowledge and skills builds confidence and unleashes their full potential and power. Our commitment today as P&G and through our Always brand contributes to our aspiration to build a better world for all of us — a world free of gender bias." Those who want to support this commitment can donate to UNESCO and Save the Children funds, which will allow them to reach more girls and women with life-changing support.

But Mr Trew, who has spent 38 years in the industry, will not give up work entirely as he will stay on as part-time as director of community involvement for the hotel. Mr Trew, 66, said: I really very much enjoy working with people and Ive enjoyed every day of the time that Ive spent here. To this day, I look forward to coming to work. He added: The nice thing is that no two days are the same. Different things are coming your way, whether guest-related issues or staff issues  its really interesting. Im very fortunate in that the hotel has asked me to stay on three days a week  Im very much looking forward to that because I enjoy golf and that will allow me to get in two extra days playing golf. But Mr Trew, who began his career in 1979 as assistant front desk manager at the Fairmont Southampton, might never have joined the industry he came to love as he first took a degree in business administration at McMaster University in Canada and worked in accountancy for consumer goods firm Proctor & Gamble for several years before returning to Bermuda. He said: I always enjoyed working with people and after working for three years at Proctor & Gamble, I didnt meet anyone. After three years of that I wanted to try something different and returned home and opened a sweater shop  after three years of that, I joined the hotel. And since then he has swapped between Southampton and Hamilton in increasingly senior management posts before returning to the Hamilton Princess as hotel manager, in charge of day-to-day operations, in 2006. Mr Trew said: Over these years, Ive seen quite a few changes. Ive seen the hotels go from primarily being serviced by Bermudians and Ive certainly seen a change in the guests we now get. In the past few years, our guests have come with higher expectations. Bermuda is not an inexpensive destination and if they come with higher expectations, its up to us to deliver. He added: Because the hospitality industry is a seven-day operation, even though people dont work seven days, a lot of Bermudians at that time enjoyed their weekends off. There was a growing construction industry which led a lot of young locals away into that industry because their earning power was greater and they had their weekends off. But he said he was glad to see a drive, spearheaded by the Bermuda Hospitality Institute, to recruit more Bermudians into the industry. Mr Trew added: There is a sort of a turnaround and were seeing more interest by young Bermudians. He explained that many thought their options were limited to waiting duties or housekeeping. But he said: There are far greater opportunities than those two careers. We will do tours for schoolkids and well take them through the kitchens and show them the pastry chefs or butchers at work and its very nice to see the interest shown by young Bermudians in these areas. Mr Trews time at the Princess has seen the hotel transformed with a massive investment of around $100 million by new owners the Green family. He said: The changes that weve made here have been absolutely fantastic  and theyve come at the right time. Having been at the hotel for a number of years and seeing the state of the physical plant prior to the Greens buying it, I was almost every day wishing someone would come along with a lot of money and invest in us. For me, its been personally satisfying and personally and professionally challenging to see this whole project come to fruition. Mr Trew added that he had dealt with a few interesting situations over his career which still made him look back and laugh. He recalled a guest during one of his stints at the Fairmont Southampton who arrived without a booking from the UK and said that his visit would be paid for by a local travel agent, by arrangement with an overseas travel operator. Mr Trew checked the guest in and later called the travel agent who confirmed the story of the guest  who ran up a $25,000 bill in just three days. Mt Trew said: In ten days, the gentlemans bill was $84,000. He left us, we sent the bill to the local travel agent and they paid the money. Some time later, I was at home watching 60 Minutes on television and he was featured as a fraudster who was selling investment schemes to people. And he said of his new role as community ambassador: We get approached by a lot of local entities looking for support or in-kind donations Ill be looking after that and ensuring we get more involved in the local community. Jamahl Simmons, the Shadow Minister of Tourism, offered congratulations on behalf of the Progressive Labour Party. Mr Trew is a fine example of what we believe is Bermudas greatest tourism asset: hard working Bermudians in the industry, Mr Simmons said. We enthusiastically welcome his continued involvement in Tourism in his new role as director of community involvement for the hotel and wish him much success. Having had the pleasure of working with Mr Trew at The Hamilton Princess sister hotel, I can personally attest to his work ethic and commitment to quality service. His willingness and enthusiasm in encouraging and mentoring Bermudians in hospitality sets a high standard. Make text smaller Make text larger Comments You must be registered or signed-in to post comment or to vote.

Podcasts & Newsletter Service Teaching German Teaching German DW im Unterricht Unterrichtsreihen Deutschlehrer-Info Germany World Business Science Environment Culture Sports TOP STORIES / Environment plastic waste Big businesses vow to tackle plastics problem At the World Economic Forum in Davos, major corporations have signed on to an initiative to better reuse and recycle plastic packaging - to reap economic benefits, and in hopes of stemming an environmental crisis. Unilever, Proctor and Gamble, Coca-Cola, Danone and Dow Chemical are among the heavy players in the 40 parties to have endorsed New Plastics Economy initiative Monday (16.01.2017) at the Swiss ski resort during the World Economic Forum (WEF). If enacted, the plan would see 70 percent of plastic packaging reused and recycled globally - five times more than the percentage currently estimated to be recycled. The New Plastics Economy plan, spearheaded by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and unveiled at the WEF in January 2016, points out that, without urgent action, the planet's oceans will contain more plastic waste than fish by 2050. The action plan endorsed in Davos in 2017, which is based on the concept of a circular economy, said 20 percent of the world's plastic packaging could be profitably reused, and a further 50 percent recycled instead of becoming waste. Plastic packaging can be tricky to recycle Food and detergents multinational Unilever has now promised that all of its plastic packaging be fully reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. In a statement, Unilever CEO Paul Polman said: "We urgently need to transform global plastic packaging material flows if we are to continue to reap the benefits of this versatile material … it's now up to us all to get it done." New Plastics Economy estimates that about a quarter of all plastics that are produced end up as packaging. Most plastic is made from oil, and it requires significant energy to produce - which contributes to greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. When plastics enter the natural environment as waste, this impacts wildlife and ecosystems; 10 to 20 million tons of plastic end up in the world's oceans every year. Two-thirds of all seabirds have consumed plastics, a 2015 study said. Fish, sea turtles, marine mammals and innumerable other sea creatures also consume plastics. Many ocean animals become entangled in plastic waste - this can lead to a painful death, as the creature slowly starves or suffocates. Although the full effects of animals consuming plastic waste have not been thoroughly studied, it is known to impair digestion, and can reduce the vigor of the organism. Microplastics can even end up on our own plates in seafood or ocean fish. Over the next year, the New Plastics Economy initiative and its partners will seek to innovate around redesigning plastic packaging. Fighting the plastic flood Tons of trash At least 8 million tons of plastic waste ends up in the world's oceans every year, according to a report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. The report warns plastic trash will outweigh fish by 2050 unless drastic action is taken. Much of the floating trash collects in several large ocean vortices far from land. Beaches, like this one on Midway Island in the remote Pacific Ocean, also suffer. Fighting the plastic flood Addicted to plastic The floating plastic isn't just an eyesore: as it breaks down into smaller pieces, marine animals mistake it for food. A recent study by Uppsala University showed ingesting plastic can have devastating effects on fish, including stunted growth and increased mortality rates. Surprisingly, some fish even seem to prefer plastic. Plastic in fish is also suspected of posing health risks for humans. Fighting the plastic flood Edible alternatives The Ocean Conservancy estimates more than 690 species of marine animals have been affected by plastic pollution. In an effort to reduce the impact of all that waste, some companies have come up with alternatives. The Delray Beach craft brewery, in Florida, has developed edible six-pack rings from wheat and barley left over from the brewing process. It hopes to begin production in October. Fighting the plastic flood Biodegradable packaging As an alternative to single-use plastic packaging - which makes up a significant portion of the waste found in oceans - some companies have come up with biodegradable alternatives. At a plant in Poland, wheat bran is being used. According to inventor Jerzy Wysocki, the Biotrem packaging can be used in the oven or freezer, and will decompose in 30 days - or can simply be eaten. Extra fiber! Fighting the plastic flood Bamboo to the rescue? Fast-growing bamboo is also an alternative to plastic - used to make everything from toothbrushes, shower curtains, utensils and even computer parts. Work at the Tonggu Jiangqiao Bamboo & Wood Industry Company, pictured here, started mass production of bamboo keyboards, mice and monitor casings in 2008. Fighting the plastic flood Ocean skimmer Alternatives may help reduce waste, but millions of tons of plastic still float around the world's oceans - and will remain for centuries, slowly breaking down. Dutch foundation Ocean Cleanup aims to collect the trash with a 100-kilometer (60-mile) floating dam system that is supposed to trap plastic waste without harming fish and other sea creatures. It aims to install one in the Pacific by 2020. Fighting the plastic flood From trash to fashion Some of that plastic could be recycled and reused in other forms, becoming flower pots, home insulation or - in the case of Spanish firm Ecoalf - clothing. The Madrid-based clothing line takes plastic waste collected by 200 fishing boats in the Mediterranean, crushes it into flakes, and then creates polyester fibers - which in turn become fashionable jackets, backpacks and other items. Fighting the plastic flood Reduce, recycle ... and reuse Plastic waste can also be reused in its original form.

The plan was announced at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort, where powerful executives are gathering just days ahead of the inauguration of Donald Trump as US president, who views concern about such environmental issues with suspicion. The planet's dangerously polluted oceans will contain more plastic waste than fish by 2050 if urgent action isn't taken, the companies warned. Answering a call by British sailor and philanthropist Ellen MacArthur, multinationals such as Unilever and Procter and Gamble made a commitment to increase recycling and cut back overall use. Food-to-detergents giant Unilever said it would ensure that all of its plastic packaging "is fully reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025". The Davos initiative said 20 percent of the world's plastic production could be profitably re-used and a further 50 percent recycled instead of infesting landfills and killing wildlife in the ocean. But even then, "without fundamental redesign and innovation, the remaining 30 percent of plastic packaging (by weight) will never be recycled and the equivalent of 10 billion garbage bags per year will be destined to landfill or incineration", the WEF said. "The 'New Plastics Economy' initiative has attracted widespread support, and across the industry we are seeing strong initial momentum and alignment on the direction to take," said MacArthur, who is a regular Davos presence along with celebrities such as Matt Damon. Other companies backing the initiative include Coca-Cola, Danone and Dow Chemical. "Plastics are the workhorse material of the modern economy -– with unbeaten properties," said Martin Stuchtey, a professor for resource management at Innsbruck University in Austria who is working on the programme. "Minor changes in material, format and treatment ... can make the economics of recycling viable and take us into a positive spiral of ... lower costs and better design," he said.

(GuruFocus) Many market observers speculating that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates multiple times this year following just one increase in each of the past two years. Couple that with some investors theorizing 3 percent Treasury yields would spell doom for the bond bull market, high dividend stocks and exchange-traded funds could come under pressure. There are plenty of ETFs that, while focusing on payout strategies, do not emphasize high dividend names and/or defensive, rate-sensitive sectors. That group includes the Schwab Strategic Trust (NYSE: SCHD). The ETF And Her Index The $4.9 billion SCHD tracks the Dow Jones Dividend 100 Index, which along with a quality mandates that constituent firms have a dividend increase streak of at least 10 years. As highlighted by top 10 holdings such as Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG) and The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO), many of SCHD's 114 holdings have payout increase streaks spanning much longer than 10 years. A Quiet Entrance Still, SCHD has not set the world on fire since coming to market in 2011. “Since its inception in October 2011, SCHD has managed to keep pace with its average peer in the large-value category. The fund's middling performance over this span can be largely attributed to the fact that high-quality stocks have lagged both the broader market as well as higher-beta, lesser-quality firms,” said Morningstar in a recent note. With a focus on dividend consistency and growth, it is not surprising that SCHD's largest sector weight is consumer staples at over a quarter of the ETF's weight. Talk About A Tech Allocation! However, SCHD also has one of the largest allocations to technology stocks among all dividend ETFs at nearly 21.5 percent. That is notable for multiple reasons, including tech's dividend ascent over the past few years and the sector's stout cash piles, which should ensure dividend growth going forward. “Relative to its large-cap dividend-oriented peers, this fund will likely generate an income stream that is more stable and that should grow with time. This is reflective of the methodology of its underlying benchmark, which specifically targets high-quality, steady dividend payers, and is not--as some of competing funds' benchmarks are — tuned to isolate constituents exclusively on the basis of high current and/or prospective payouts or yields,” according to Morningstar. With an annual expense ratio of 0.07 percent, or $7 per $10,000 invested, SCHD is the least expensive dividend ETF on the market. Yes, even less expensive than its Vanguard equivalents.

Houston, TX (PRWEB) January 17, 2017 HighRadius, the leading provider of Credit and Accounts Receivable automation solutions and the preferred choice of Fortune 1000 companies, will host their 4th Annual Credit and Accounts Receivable Innovation Conference on February 20-22, 2017. Record registrations are taking place for this newly expanded event where hundreds of accounts receivable professionals exchange with their peers lessons learned and best practices that provide immediate improvement in operations and efficiency in the CPG, Apparel, Food and Food Services, Industrial and Chemical Manufacturing, Energy, Wholesale / Distribution, Pharmaceuticals, Hi-tech, Services, and Transportation and Logistics industries. The two-and-a half-day, all-inclusive event features speaking sessions from leading credit, A/R and payments industry practitioners and thought leaders Procter & Gamble, Starbucks, adidas Group, Danone, EmployBridge, Land O’Lakes, J. J. Keller, McCormick, Tyson, XPO Logistics and more on Tuesday and Wednesday, February 21 and 22. In-depth training sessions that cover step-by-step instructions and best practices to unlock new efficiencies and productivity gains will take place before the main conference on Monday, February 20, 2017. Attendees need not be users of HighRadius products to attend the conference and gain valuable insights and tangible, executable steps that will provide tremendous advantages for credit and A/R teams. Beyond the high-profile speaking sessions, A/R Automation Stations across the credit-to-cash cycle will be available to allow attendees to view robotics process automation in action. Immediate Impact Workshops will guide participants through specific process improvements and software tweaks that unlock efficiencies. With a Totally Awesome Eighties theme and a Zumba class, the conference will also strive to be an upbeat, fun event that is not a typical run-of-the-mill conference. Every year, attendees benefit from the learning opportunities provided. “The Credit and A/R Innovation Conference is a can’t-miss event,” says Mike Pettyjohn, Director, Customer Financial Services, Danone North America, Finance Business Services. “This year’s speaker line up is tremendous and anyone in the credit and A/R space needs to carve out the time to attend. The sessions are extremely informative and it’s clear that HighRadius takes seriously their mission to lead credit and A/R teams to the most innovative approaches and introduce leading-edge technology to change the payment processing game. I am excited to hear from industry peers and to also have the opportunity to impart my knowledge and experience.” Mike, along with Jessica Butler of Attain Consulting, will be leading one of the scheduled Tuesday Impact Workshops on Deductions: 5 Actionable Improvements to Deductions Operations. “I am extremely excited that event registrations have already blown last year’s count out of the water as more and more credit and A/R leaders realize the value this conference provides.

Mind Click was recently acquired by e-learning firm Learning Pool – ranked as one of the fastest-growing technology businesses in Ireland. It has now announced plans to create new jobs at its Strelley Hall base, where it works with clients such as Boots, Procter & Gamble and Sky, as it launched a new graduate programme. The company, which employs more than 40 staff, also hopes to relocate to Nottingham city centre later this year to accommodate the anticipated growth and attract the county's most talented workforce. Sean Reddington, Mind Click managing director, said: "Growing with Mind Click has been an incredible journey and now we've teamed up with Learning Pool we have over 400 joint clients, giving us the capability to expand even further. "Our new partnership has already opened up multiple job opportunities for people in Nottingham and we are expecting further capacity for multiple strategic hires in the New Year in tandem with our big office move to the city centre."

After acquiring Mind Click in September last year, it created up to 10 jobs in Nottingham and boosted its joint workforce to 120 people – making it the largest provider of Totara learning management systems (LMS) in the global network. It aims to continue focusing on innovation to deliver "first-class learning solutions" to both public and private sector clients across the UK and internationally. This includes "gamification", where video games are used to encourage engagement with a product, as well as creating virtual environments and fresh visuals to learn about topics. It also builds programmes for controlling training schemes, while helping users switch between platforms containing course content, such as Moodle and Blackboard. Learning Pool, which was given the highest accreditation of three stars in the Sunday Times Best Companies to Work For 2016, already has a scholarship scheme in place, as well as five IT student placements with permanent job prospects. The company is now looking to open up similar career opportunities with Mind Click for graduates with aspirations to work in the technology sector. There is currently one graduate vacancy, included within the eight other jobs initially made available within the business. These roles are across a range of departments, including sales and marketing, technical support and project management. Georgia Avery, a recent graduate who works at Mind Click as a solutions architect, said: "It's a challenge to follow your desired career path straight out of university but Mind Click offered me a fantastic opportunity with a graduate scheme that has allowed me to boost my confidence and excel my career in the technology industry.

"It's such an exciting and fulfilling company to be a part of. The unique, fun and family-like working culture in both Mind Click and Learning Pool is unparalleled and I'm excited to progress my career with the inspirational organisation." Paul McElvaney, CEO at Learning Pool, said: "2016 was a whirlwind year for us. We secured significant investment from Carlyle Cardinal Ireland, welcomed the talented Mind Click team into the Learning Pool family and now we're looking for even more enthusiastic people to join our team in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK. "These appointments will allow us to build out our technology at a quicker pace for our customer's benefit. I'm excited about the next phase of Learning Pool's growth that will see us deliver more product innovation and significant expansion of our customer base and our team."

Multinationals to act on ocean-clogging plastics Technology Tuesday 17 January 2017 - 5:40am Wooden boats are seen on a polluted beach in Jakarta, Indonesia, 16 March 2016. According to data from a report of environment advocacy group Ocean Conservancy, roughly eight million tons of plastic enter the ocean every year. Photo: EPA/BAGUS INDAHONO DAVOS – Forty of the world's biggest companies assembled in Davos agreed on Monday to come up with cleaner ways to make and consume plastic as waste threatens the global eco-system, especially in oceans. The plan was announced at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort, where powerful executives are gathering just days ahead of the inauguration of Donald Trump as US president, who views concern about such environmental issues with suspicion. The planet's dangerously polluted oceans will contain more plastic waste than fish by 2050 if urgent action isn't taken, the companies warned. READ: China passes new law that levies taxes on pollution Answering a call by British sailor and philanthropist Ellen MacArthur, multinationals such as Unilever and Procter and Gamble made a commitment to increase recycling and cut back overall use. Food-to-detergents giant Unilever said it would ensure that all of its plastic packaging "is fully reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025". The Davos initiative said 20 percent of the world's plastic production could be profitably re-used and a further 50 percent recycled instead of infesting landfills and killing wildlife in the ocean. But even then, "without fundamental redesign and innovation, the remaining 30 percent of plastic packaging (by weight) will never be recycled and the equivalent of 10 billion garbage bags per year will be destined to landfill or incineration", the WEF said. "The 'New Plastics Economy' initiative has attracted widespread support, and across the industry we are seeing strong initial momentum and alignment on the direction to take," said MacArthur, who is a regular Davos presence along with celebrities such as Matt Damon. Other companies backing the initiative include Coca-Cola, Danone and Dow Chemical. "Plastics are the workhorse material of the modern economy – with unbeaten properties," said Martin Stuchtey, a professor for resource management at Innsbruck University in Austria who is working on the programme. "Minor changes in material, format and treatment ... can make the economics of recycling viable and take us into a positive spiral of ... lower costs and better design," he said. AFP Comment Now!

Home Industry Coca-Cola’s #BrotherlyLove campaign missing the local Indian flavour Coca-Cola’s #BrotherlyLove campaign missing the local Indian flavour Though running global campaigns across markets isn’t new, advertisers agree that localising is important to create a connect. By: Meghna Sharma | Published: January 17, 2017 6:50 AM Though running global campaigns across markets isn’t new, advertisers agree that localising is important to create a connect. For a major multinational company to run its global campaign across markets is not a new phenomenon. Every now and then, a single campaign is aired across regions to emphasise on the brand’s message and vision. Or often, their ‘locally’ adapted versions. Most global campaigns tend to focus on universal truths: emotions that resonate with people all across the globe — love, sex and peace. And then each of these can have their own avatars. For instance, for 2016 Rio Olympics, P&G ran its tear-jerker Thank you, Mom ad from the Wieden & Kennedy stable, continuing a six-year run with a two-minute film depicting the strong mothers behind Olympic athletes. You May Also Like To Watch This: Now consider Coca-Cola India which has launched #BrotherlyLove, a commercial capturing the camaraderie between two brothers. The film, released on YouTube late last month, is the brand’s Indian execution of the international ad which was launched in January 2016. The film highlights the unique and challenging relationship experienced between two brothers. When the younger brother finds himself without his ice-cold Coca-Cola and is bullied by other kids, his big brother comes to the rescue. Following the ‘one brand’ strategy of introducing one single iconic brand campaign that celebrates both the product and the brand, Coca-Cola launched the Indian version of the Brotherly Love TVC which depicts everyday moments of life. “We have a bouquet of ads as part of our global Taste the Feeling campaign from which we choose the ads which are best suited to the Indian context and reality,” says a Coca-Cola spokesperson. “Brotherly Love’s Indian version differs from the global campaign in terms of the nature of playful bullying between brothers around Coca-Cola along with new situations added to bring in freshness to the ad campaign.” “Love can be segmented into a spouse’s love, a lover’s love, a wife’s love, sisterly love, brotherly love and more. Coke has used one of these segmented positions to popularise itself,” says Harish Bijoor, brand expert and founder of Harish Bijoor Consults. This is not the first time the company has done so.

(Supplied photo) The start-up has successfully adapted augmented reality for children's edutainment Amongst other successes, the start-up featured today has successfully adapted Augmented Reality (AR) to Edutainment for children. AR brings education to life for children, making learning a happy interactive experience. On October 18, 2016 this column had described the history of AR. It had also made reference to an article in fastcompany.com that indicates that investments in the AR and Virtual Reality (VR) space will exceed $150 billion. On December 6, 2016, Amazon set out to change the way people shop for groceries. The launch of Amazon Go's store in Seattle visibly blurred the lines between the physical and the digital space. Although shoppers physically buy at the store, the entire experience is digital. Physical shopping has gone virtual through the usage of facial recognition, the application of artificial intelligence, geo-location and the elimination of the entire check-out process,. Regardless of the success of Amazon Go, it is self-evident that the physical retail industry has reached a bend in the road from which there will be no going back. The convergence of the physical and the virtual world is happening in multiple areas. The list includes applications in medicine, art, construction, education, precision engineering and tourism amongst an ever expanding number of other verticals. The story In a dimly-lit cinema hall, a little boy of Middle Eastern origin watched the Back To The Future trilogy with rapt attention. Like many of the young minds around the world that watched the series, there was an explosion of thoughts about time, space and possibility. Dany El-Eid decided right then that he had to live his dream. No wonder when you talk to him now, you cannot miss his wide-eyed wonder and infectious enthusiasm for all that is happening around.  Right through his studies, he kept his finger on the pulse of technology and the creative arts. El-Eid is the Founder and CEO of Pixelbug (www.pixelbug.com), an award winning Virtual and Augmented Reality company. The first flagship product is Colorbug (www.getcolorbug.com) a family-oriented edutainment AR app launched in 2015 and available on the iOS and Google stores. Colorbug was an evolution from the pioneering work that Pixelbug had done in creating a platform to help global brands such as Proctor & Gamble, Lego and Citibank create an AR experience for their customers. Looking at the work done for these companies, it was surprising to see that Pixelbug, a UAE-based company, has been doing cutting-edge AR work at least a couple of years ahead of the Pokemon Go craze. El-Eid has no rancour or cynicism. In fact, he's really glad that more people are waking up to the possibilities of AR and VR in this part of the world. His inbuilt enthusiasm and energy has kept him motivated from his first job onwards. The MD of the first company that he worked in as a digital media specialist would often come around trying to understand exactly what El-Eid was up to. This was at a time that Facebook had not even begun to be popular and people had no understanding of the power of digital media.  He then went on to launch Out of The Blue, a Bluetooth-based marketing technology. The company did not take off. That did not dampen his enthusiasm in the least. He got back to a job. While working he participated in the Stars of Science contest instituted by the Qatar Foundation. He was one of the 16 finalists. With this recognition and the support that came with it, he built the first AR headset, even before Google Glass was launched. This recognition validated his strong belief in his Middle Eastern identity. It helped reinforce to him that, given the right environment and encouragement, innovation from this part of the world is on par with the best. He launched Pixelbug. As soon as he got his first big brand name as a customer, he quit his job and became a full-time entrepreneur. And from then on, the company has grown from success to success, first with implementations for corporate customers and now the Colorbug app. You can experience Pixelbug's AR and VR by downloading the Colorbug app and templates. Another fun way of experiencing AR is to go to the Lost Chambers Aquarium in the Atlantis on the Palm. An AR-based virtual treasure hunt will guide you and reward you for searching and discovering species of marine life in the aquarium. The next step for Pixelbug is to create the equivalent of a website builder like WordPress for AR. Using this platform, corporate organisations can tap into the Pixelbug platform to fully create their own AR experience from within their own app or digital interface.  Think one step beyond Amazon Go. You could enter a store and point your phone at anything you want to buy. A virtual assistant will pop up and give you key information that you need to know about the product including price and availability. You could even query the assistant in real time. Pixelbug has won a number of awards including the MIT Enterprise Forum Pan Arab Entrepreneurship prize in 2015. This year, Pixelbug was a finalist in the highly prestigious Dubai Future Accelerators event, lining up the company for even more success. The writer is a director at Vyashara.

That was why the home-grown skincare company has embarked on an exceptionally ambitious expansion journey across Asia since it was set up in April 2015 with the aim of offering affordable products. In less than two years, The Face Inc has established a presence in eight markets - Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Taiwan and China - selling its 16 proprietary skin treatment products in more than 1,000 retail stores. In comparison with its large rivals, sales may be modest to date but the firm has succeeded in creating an extensive regional network in a short time. "In this industry, there are constantly new brands and new products. So we want to make sure our products do not get weeded out by competition," Mr Goh, 37, told The Straits Times in a recent interview. QUALITY AND AFFORDABILITY A lot of people here who are in need of quality skincare end up buying products from aesthetic clinics, dermatologists, because they can't find what they need on the shelves. We wanted to get rid of that kind of affordability and accessibility issue. MR WILSON GOH, managing partner of The Face Inc, on his firm's aims to bring affordable skincare products to the market. "We had it planned since day one - the idea is to grow very fast, to achieve scale. Doing that will allow us to access a lot of advantages, be it in terms of product cost or marketing," he said. After all, the skincare industry is traditionally dominated by giant corporations such as Procter & Gamble, which owns Japanese prestige beauty brand SK-II, and Unilever, alongside a number of smaller Japanese and Korean firms. Mr Goh said The Face Inc aims to plug a gap in the market for affordable, yet high-performance, skincare treatment products. "A lot of people here who are in need of quality skincare end up buying products from aesthetic clinics, dermatologists, because they can't find what they need on the shelves," noted Mr Goh, who left his job as chief operating officer of a non-surgical aesthetics firm in 2015 to set up The Face Inc with his business partner, a dermatologist. "We wanted to get rid of that kind of affordability and accessibility issue. So the products we offer are very similar to what you might get from a dermatologist - a personalised set of prescriptions - but probably at a fraction of that price. It's about bringing the doctor to you." The Face Inc has an intelligent online skincare consultation system that offers customers a personalised diagnosis of their skin concerns before prescribing the appropriate treatment products. Close to 800 different treatment protocols and permutations can be derived from the 16 products, Mr Goh said. Expanding the company's footprint across the region, where each country has its own set of rules and regulations, has not been easy. For example, entering the market in the Philippines took about six months, during which the firm had to get through six different government agencies just to have its products registered. To help ease the process further, The Face Inc enters each market by partnering retail companies with brick-and-mortar stores, such as Guardian or Watsons. "Choosing established stores like Guardian and Watsons helps to give credibility to a new brand like ours. Customers trust that the retailers have done their homework and that they sell reputable brands, not dodgy products," said Mr Goh. The company, which has nine employees and turned in its first profit in December 2015, raked in close to $2 million in revenue last year. The prospects, Mr Goh noted, are rosy. This comes as the Asian beauty and skincare industry, valued at about US$130 billion (S$185 billion), continued to grow from strength to strength despite the challenges in today's global economic landscape, with demand bolstered by a burgeoning middle class, particularly in China. "Whether or not the economy is doing well, people still need skincare. They may just switch to more affordable alternatives and start looking for value-for-money products," he said, adding that The Face Inc has another brand, Science on Skin, catering to users who are more cost-conscious and who prefer convenience over a more rigorous skincare regime. In line with its growth plans, Mr Goh said The Face Inc eventually hopes to start making and selling men's skincare products, although it will first take time for the market to develop and mature. He added that the company has lined up plans to expand into Thailand, Japan, India and the Middle East this year. The bigger goal for the next three to five years is to set foot in 40 countries, including those beyond Asia. "We are also definitely looking at opening our own flagship store in Singapore, hopefully by 2018. It won't be just a retail store, but one coupled with spa services."

Posted 18 Jan 2017 05:32 Updated 18 Jan 2017 05:40 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Financial shares and biotechs were among the biggest losers on Tuesday (Jan 17) as US stocks retreated ahead of the presidential inauguration of Donald Trump. Banking stocks, a winner since Trump's election, stumbled badly, with Goldman Sachs losing 3.3 per cent and Citigroup 2.1 per cent. Both companies report earnings on Wednesday. "There's some profit taking setting in with regards to financials," Bill Lynch, director of investment at Hinsdale Associates. "Given the fact they've done so well since the election based on the prospects of higher interest rates and deregulation, maybe they've come too far too fast." Banks have led a major stock rally since Trump's election Nov 8. But trade has been choppy the last couple of weeks. Pharma stocks were also weak, with Merck losing 1.4 per cent, Celgene 2.2 per cent and Gilead Sciences 1.6 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 58.96 points (0.30 per cent) to 19.826.77. The broad-based S&P 500 shed 6.75 points (0.3 per cent) to 2,267.89, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 35.39 points (0.63 per cent) to 5,538.73. Consumer staples stocks were higher, with Procter & Gamble rising 1.4 per cent, Target 1.1 per cent and Wal-Mart 1.9 per cent. Wal-Mart announced it was creating 10,000 jobs in the US in an announcement applauded by Trump. Mattel jumped 4.7 per cent after announcing that Margaret Georgiadis had been named chief executive. She previously worked as president of Americas at Google. Qualcomm tumbled 4.0 per cent on news that the Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint charging the company with using anti-competitive tactics in the supply of a key semiconductor device used in cell phones and other consumer products. - AFP/de Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Connect Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2017 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

Finance Search Banks, biotechs lead US stocks lowerAFP – Tue, Jan 17, 2017 10:28 PM AEDT Related Content View Photo At the closing bell, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen 0.1 percent to 19,804.72, while the broader S&P 500 gained 0.2 percent to 2,271.89 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.3 percent to 5,555.65 Financial shares and biotechs were among the biggest losers Tuesday as US stocks retreated ahead of the presidential inauguration of Donald Trump. Banking stocks, a winner since Trump's election, stumbled badly, with Goldman Sachs losing 3.3 percent and Citigroup 2.1 percent. Both companies report earnings Wednesday. "There's some profit taking setting in with regards to financials," Bill Lynch, director of investment at Hinsdale Associates. "Given the fact they've done so well since the election based on the prospects of higher interest rates and deregulation, maybe they've come too far too fast." Banks have led a major stock rally since Trump's election November 8. But trade has been choppy the last couple of weeks. Pharma stocks were also weak, with Merck losing 1.4 percent, Celgene 2.2 percent and Gilead Sciences 1.6 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.3 percent to 19.826.77. The broad-based S&P 500 shed 0.3 percent to 2,267.89, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 0.6 percent to 5,538.73. Consumer staples stocks were higher, with Procter & Gamble rising 1.4 percent, Target 1.1 percent and Wal-Mart 1.9 percent. Wal-Mart announced it was creating 10,000 jobs in the US in an announcement applauded by Trump. Mattel jumped 4.7 percent after announcing that Margaret Georgiadis had been named chief executive. She previously worked as president of Americas at Google. Qualcomm tumbled 4.0 percent on news that the Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint charging the company with using anticompetitive tactics in the supply of a key semiconductor device used in cell phones and other consumer products.

Today, tech vendor Cloverleaf is launching artificial intelligence-powered digital signs that slide over retailers' shelves to give marketers insights about who is standing in front of their store displays. Procter & Gamble has tested the technology—dubbed shelfPoint—and Dell is currently using it in a Micro Center store in Houston, Texas. "We're able to gather insights about what shoppers are doing in front of the shelf itself, engage them and convert the sale to get them to throw one more item into the basket," explained Gordon Davidson, founder and CEO of Cloverleaf.

A PwC survey of nearly 1,400 CEOs released on the eve of the annual World Economic Forum in Davos found that 29 per cent expected global economic growth to pick up this year, up from 27 per cent last year. It found that 38 per cent were very confident they could increase revenue growth in the next year, up from 35 per cent at the same time last year, which was a six-year low. REUTERS Firms agree to reduce plastic use Forty of the world's biggest companies that are assembled in Davos have agreed to come up with cleaner ways to make and consume plastic as waste threatens the global ecosystem, especially in oceans. The planet's dangerously polluted oceans will contain more plastic waste than fish by 2050 if urgent action is not taken, the companies warned. Answering a call by British sailor and philanthropist Ellen MacArthur, multinationals such as Unilever, Procter and Gamble, The Coca-Cola Company and Dow Chemical made a commitment to increase recycling and cut back overall plastic use. AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE Clean energy pitch for Trump Dr Bertrand Piccard, the Swiss pilot who circumnavigated the world in a solar-powered plane, wants to convince United States President-elect Donald Trump that investing in clean energy is key to creating jobs and growth. Dr Piccard, chief executive officer of Solar Impulse, wants to meet Mr Trump after he has been inaugurated to highlight the falling costs of renewables compared with fossil fuels, he said in an interview ahead of the World Economic Forum in Davos. "If they want to make America great again, they will need to use clean technologies and renewable energies," Dr Piccard said in a phone interview from Munich. "You will not have growth with old technologies." BLOOMBERG A version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on January 18, 2017, with the headline 'In Brief'.

Photo / AP The US dollar fell after President-elect Donald Trump said the currency was "too strong," undermining the nation's competitiveness abroad. Trump, who will be sworn in on Friday, made the comments in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. "The dollar is the guiding light at this point, and all eyes are on the shape US policy will take," Fredrik Nerbrand, global head of asset allocation at HSBC Holdings in London, told Bloomberg. "I would put today's dollar weakness down to noise rather than a structural shift. "If Trump wants to become as growth-generative as he's planning to be and you don't have the same fiscal push coming from the rest of the world, then it's a question of where does the capital flow to," Nerbrand noted. "The dollar is the tallest pygmy." Meanwhile, the British pound strengthened after UK Prime Minister Theresa May eased some nerves about the country's pending exit from the European Union when she said the nation's parliament will get a vote on the final terms of the Brexit deal, though her comments made clear she is seeking a so-called hard exit-the country will leave the EU's single market. "I want to be clear: What I am proposing cannot mean membership of the single market," said May. "Instead we seek the greatest possible access to it through a new comprehensive, bold and ambitious free trade agreement." Wall Street moved lower. In 1.20pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index slid 0.5 per cent.

While you were sleeping: Dollar too strong for Trump Jan. 18 (BusinessDesk) – The US dollar fell after President-elect Donald Trump said the currency was “too strong,” undermining the nation’s competitiveness abroad. Trump, who will be sworn in on Friday, made the comments in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. “The dollar is the guiding light at this point, and all eyes are on the shape US policy will take,” Fredrik Nerbrand, global head of asset allocation at HSBC Holdings in London, told Bloomberg. “I would put today’s dollar weakness down to noise rather than a structural shift. “If Trump wants to become as growth-generative as he’s planning to be and you don’t have the same fiscal push coming from the rest of the world, then it’s a question of where does the capital flow to,” Nerbrand noted. “The dollar is the tallest pygmy.” Meanwhile, the British pound strengthened after UK Prime Minister Theresa May eased some nerves about the country’s pending exit from the European Union when she said the nation’s parliament will get a vote on the final terms of the Brexit deal, though her comments made clear she is seeking a so-called hard exit—the country will leave the EU’s single market. “I want to be clear: What I am proposing cannot mean membership of the single market,” said May. “Instead we seek the greatest possible access to it through a new comprehensive, bold and ambitious free trade agreement.” Wall Street moved lower. In 1.20pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index slid 0.5 percent. In 1.06pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.2 percent. Meanwhile, US Treasuries rose, pushing yields on the 10-year note eight basis points lower to 2.32 percent. Gold, another safe-haven trade, also gained. US financial markets were closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr Day. The Dow slid as declines in shares of JPMorgan Chase and those of Goldman Sachs, recently 3.1 percent and 2.4 percent weaker respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Wal-Mart and those of Procter & Gamble, up 2.1 percent and 1.5 percent respectively. Wal-Mart said it plans to create about 10,000 US jobs this year through the opening of 59 new, expanded and relocated Walmart and Sam’s Club facilities as well as e-commerce services. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the session with a 0.2 percent decline from the previous close. Germany’s DAX Index slipped 0.1 percent, while France’s CAC 40 Index fell 0.5 percent. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index dropped 1.5 percent, as the pound’s rebound hurt shares of exporters.

(Andrew Kelly/Reuters) About The Author Peter Armstrong Host, On the Money on CBC News Network Host of On The Money on CBC News Network (7pm ET) and economics reporter for CBC news. A former host of World Report on CBC Radio, Peter Armstrong has been a foreign correspondent and parliamentary reporter for CBC. He is based in Toronto. Related Stories Stocks rise as oil climbs ahead of OPEC meeting Dow breaks through 19,000 U.S. stock indexes extend record highs Canada's economy could see an upswing in 2017 — here are 5 reasons why There are few things economic experts agree on. That the Dow Jones Industrial Average is ridiculous as an economic indicator is one. That its milestones are meaningless is another. For weeks now, headlines have been breathlessly anticipating the Dow breaking through the 20,000-point mark. Never mind that the much broader S&P500 has hit new all-time highs since Donald Trump was elected, as has the technology-focused Nasdaq — it's usually "the Dow" that claims top billing in newscasts and business pages. It finally passed the milestone on January 25th, and was met with more of the same. And yet, just about everyone who knows anything about it will tell you it is a deeply flawed, overly simplistic, wildly inaccurate measure of either the economy or stock markets. 'It just happens to be wrong' "It's actually a pretty bad metric," says John Shoven from the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. "It's poorly constructed. Its only claim to fame is that it's been around for 120 years." Before we even tackle the arcane way the Dow is calculated, let's address the milestone. "It's just a round number," says Shoven, who has criticized the Dow and our obsession with milestones in the past. "There's nothing more significant about it crossing 20,000 than when it crossed 17,500 or any other number." Dow within reach of 20,000 milestone6:18 Every time it goes up, it hits a new all-time high; we arbitrarily celebrate some more than others. When you look at the Dow's methods, things get even muddier. The Dow puts 30 big-name U.S. companies in a basket and adds up the total dollar value of all those stocks. It doesn't adjust for inflation. Dow tops 19,000 for first time The Dow has its own divisor, a figure it uses and changes over time to try to adjust for stock splits or spinoffs. As such, it gives more influence to expensive stocks. So if two companies are worth about the same amount, if one has fewer shares that are worth more, that company has an oversized influence on the average. "It's simple," says Shoven. "It just happens to be wrong." Math was really hard — in 1896 And why, you may ask, does a major stock market index use such a simplistic method? Because when the index was created back in 1896, computers didn't yet exist. "The Dow Jones is just a relic from old days, when computation was difficult," says Ronald Balvers, professor of finance at the DeGroote School of Business at Hamilton's McMaster University. He says the Dow is built the way it is because that was the easiest way to add things up 120 years ago. The Dow has been flirting with 20,000 for weeks now. It closed at 19,911.21 on December 13, 2016. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) That basket of 30 companies has traditionally been something of a relic, as well. Apple was only added in 2015. General Electric has held a spot since 1907. Proctor and Gamble's been listed since 1932 and Dupont since 1935.  Balvers says that means the index offers a limited scope into market activity. "We're not including bonds, we're not including real estate, we're not including small companies, so from that perspective it's a bit of a very select measure of the performance of financial markets," Balvers says. It's misleading, too  Worse yet, Shoven says, the Dow does not include dividends. So it doesn't come close to reflecting total returns for shareholders. If the Dow had added dividends back when it overhauled the index in 1928, it would be approaching a very different milestone today. 5 reasons Canada's economy is looking up in 2017 "If you had the total return index," he says, the Dow "would be well over 500,000 today, approaching a million. On the very long run, it's off — it's way off." So keep all this in mind as you are inundated with blaring headlines about the Dow breaking through 20,000. It is a snapshot of a particular group of stocks and it provides some limited historical context. The Dow Jones is a dated relic of an older time. Traders keep an eye on it, but most use other indexes as a more accurate measure of market activity. (Mark Lennihan/Associated Press) What the Dow does do is show a very broad trend in stock markets. "I would say it is right directionally," says Shoven. "It indicates that stock prices have gone up over the long haul — and indeed they have." The Dow is up, as is the S&P 500 and almost every other North American stock index. But the whole point of an index like this is to help us understand something about the stock market and about the state of the economy at large. And on that, the Dow is an indisputably lousy indicator.

African governments are promoting value-addition. / Appolonia Uwanziga. More in Business Annual EPRN meet to discuss ways to keep economy competitive RRA donates Rwf45m to build homes for Genocide survivors in Ngoma Appetite for RNIT Iterambere Fund reinvestment option surges further Africa is home to seven of the 10 fastest-growing economies in the world, and despite the pre-conceived ideas of a continent forever plagued by disease, war and turmoil, it is rapidly becoming one of the most desirable investment destinations. The past two years have, however, not been easy for the continent. In 2015, GDP growth slowed to 3.0 per cent, down from 4.5 per cent in 2014 due to an economic slump, while low commodity prices continued to impede growth last year, and expansion decelerated to lows not seen since the 2009 global financial crisis. However, I believe the continent will bounce back this year. Here’s why. While the headlines might be all about falling commodity prices, here on the ground I’m seeing something different: an environment where private sector-led investment is starting to flourish, thanks to economic and political reforms by governments. Indeed, the business landscape has been rapidly changing, due to increased regional mobility, rapid urbanisation and population growth, all of which has boosted demand for African-made products and services. This, coupled with strong interconnectedness and a sense of pan-Africanism, has brought much optimism for businesses operating in the region. With the public sector facilitating the establishment of Africa’s biggest economic bloc, which could culminate in a Free Trade Area, spanning Cape to Cairo, the next great investment destination for 2017 may very well be Africa. Take the example of agri-business, which has and always will be at the centre of growth in the continent. Recently, the continent has seen a surge of innovations that are accelerating agricultural productivity. For instance, new platforms are providing farmers data on commodity prices, the availability of buyers and sellers, and guidance on best practices in harvesting and disease management. Four signs that things are looking up in Africa The rise of these innovations speaks to the progress and potential of Africa’s economy more broadly, its people and their ability to identify localised solutions for growth. But this isn’t the only clue as to Africa’s potential. In fact, I see four key trends driving large-scale private sector growth on the continent. These trends are, not only shaping the strategies for existing companies, but have also influenced the nature and appetite for joint venture projects across the continent. Processing and value-addition For a long time, development practitioners have emphasised need to give more attention to the processing of raw agricultural produce rather than exporting unprocessed agricultural commodities. Indeed, African governments have been promoting value-addition for economic development for years, and yet there are still plenty of investment opportunities. Over 80 per cent of value in the global food industry is in value-added components such as sorting, cleaning and packaging fruits and vegetables. The various forms of value-addition provide opportunities for the private sector to expand their commercial activities and access higher-value markets, either for domestic consumers or exports. Not only do they provide employment at all levels, but they have proven time and time again to drastically change the economic landscape of countries. A good example of this is Kenya; the export value of fresh vegetables grew by as much as 250 per cent after it stopped simply exporting raw material and started incorporating value-added tasks such as cleaning, packaging and freezing products. Similar to the fruit and vegetables sub-sectors, Africa’s cotton and apparel value chain have joined forces to integrate the global textile supply chain. In South Africa, the Aid by Trade Foundation entered into a partnership with the African Cotton and Textiles Industries Federation to promote the sustainable cotton and textile industry in sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of this partnership was to increase productivity, competitiveness and sustainability of cotton production, and thus strengthen textile production in Africa. In Tanzania, the MeTL Group started out with cotton ginning operations for export. We then opened four textile factories for spinning and weaving of cotton in Tanzania and Mozambique. Today, we have launched our first ever garmenting factory which manufactures school uniforms, T-shirts and several cotton-apparel by-products. With its growing population and increasingly skilled labour force, Africa is ideally placed to benefit from processing and value-addition across the agro-processing sub-sector. Fast-moving consumer goods for Africa by Africa Africa is home to one of the world’s fastest growing populations and an exploding middle-class with more disposable income than ever before. As a result, there is high demand for fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), such as apparel, hygiene products, food and electronics. Currently, almost all these products are still being imported. FMCG retailers tend to operate in low-margin environments and, as a result, large markets are crucial to their growth and success. With a rapidly growing continent and changing livelihoods, the potential for private sector actors in the FMCG space is promising for 2017 and beyond. McKinsey projects the growth of these consumer-facing industries will surpass $400 billion by 2020. Over the past few years, several African entrepreneurs have started local production using locally-available material in manufacturing soaps, edible oils, household cleaning products, and even school uniforms. From local companies like Del Monte Kenya Limited, Tongaat Hulett, to foreign conglomerates like Unilever and Procter and Gamble, Africa’s FMCG sector has provided plenty of business opportunities, and there are some who say this could be the next “gold rush”. US retail giant Wal-Mart’s recent $2.5 billion dollar investment into South African retailer Massmart points that way. McKinsey have described this sector as the “single-largest business opportunity in Africa”. If figures from the A.T. Kearney 2015 African Retail Development Index (ARDI) are anything to go by, that prediction is accurate. ‘Bottom of the pyramid’ consumers Despite rapid socio-political advancements in Africa, only around half of people there earn more than $4 a day. While in Africa this might be categorised as “middle class”, manufacturers locally and globally would still label them as low-income consumers, or the bottom of the pyramid (BOP) market. The competitive advantage of African owned and run businesses is that, unlike their foreign counterparts, they understand the purchasing decisions of the world’s more than five billion low-income consumers, which gives them a competitive edge. When CK Prahalad’s published The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid, he was speaking directly to the many African entrepreneurs that understood the world’s poor and their untapped buying power. Companies on the continent are learning how to serve these consumers while making money in the process. Single-use and/or low-cost products have been experiencing solid demand. Products like SC Johnson’s individual mosquito coils for $0.01 and returnable 200ml bottles of Coca-Cola continue to be profitable because these companies have invested heavily in the logistics needed to reach BOP consumers, and have carried out market research on the packaging and disposable income required for poorer consumers to be able to buy their products.  African export market Export-led growth has been a successful strategy for several developing economies. Through incentive programmes and policies, African governments and multilateral donors have encouraged exports, which have allowed companies to further diversity their operations and reap the financial benefits. For a long time, the continent was not able to meet global export requirements. However, with the multiplicity of opportunities today – increased market linkages, partnership support, consultation, information sharing and tailored training for export trading – we’ve been able to take advantage of the global demand for African exports. With a growing world population and an imminent danger of global food shortages, Africa is well poised to become the breadbasket of the world. Africa’s exports will be critical to our development as a global society. The continent’s exports will become extremely important in the growth of Africa’s private sector this year and beyond. These four trends have been a long time in the making, but after a slow 2016, it looks like 2017 could be a good year for all those doing business in what is now one of the most exciting and dynamic regions in the world.  The writer is the president and CEO, MeTL Group, Tanzania  Adapted from: https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/four-trends-that-will-shape-the-african-business-landscape-in-2017 Please enable JavaScript to view the Comments powered by Disqus.

On Monday, the group announced that Dennis Darby is leaving his role as CEO of the Ontario Pharmacists Association and taking the helm at CME starting January 30. “Manufacturing remains the cornerstone of the Canadian economy, representing almost one-third of all economic activity. It has been and must continue to be the pillar of innovation, of wealth creation and of prosperity for Canada,” Darby is quoted as saying in a press release. “We will work together with governments to support our vision and the central role that manufacturing continues to play in Canada.” The press release notes that Darby strengthened the Ontario Pharmacists Association by increasing memberships and advocating public policy improvements for association members. Prior to that, he had a 24-year career at Procter & Gamble. Darby takes over from Jayson Myers, who left CME at the end of September after 25 years with the organization. When CME announced Myers’ departure last June, they noted his many “advocacy successes.” Those included corporate and payroll tax reductions for businesses, the implementation of the Accelerated Capital Cost Reduction (ACCA), the creation of the Regulatory User Fee Reduction Act and the negotiation and signing of various free trade agreements. Monthly communication reports from the office of the lobbying commissioner show the association has been very active recently. The 12-month lobbying summary for Mathew Wilson, vice president, national policy, shows 199 reported communications related to a range of policies, bills, and programs — among them a national manufacturing and exporting strategy, funding support for manufacturers and opposition to plain packaging for tobacco. The summary lists communications with the prime minister, innovation and economic development minister, and the governor of the Bank of Canada.

CONRAD DE AENLLE The New York Times News Service Published Monday, Jan. 16, 2017 1:44PM EST Last updated Monday, Jan. 16, 2017 1:49PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Losing one referendum crucial to the future of Europe may be regarded as misfortune, but, as Oscar Wilde might say, losing two looks like carelessness. Europe’s leaders are looking careless after forcing votes in Britain and Italy that went the wrong way, from their perspective, within less than six months. But you would barely realize that any of that happened, judging by the performance of European markets. Stocks plunged after the British vote in June to leave the European Union, and had a more muted decline, based on futures prices, after the Italian referendum last month, which strengthened the hand of politicians who want to take Italy out of the euro. Despite those short-term moves, the average fund that invests in European stocks ended 2016 not far from where it started, down 2.4 perc ent, according to the investment research firm Morningstar, mostly because of a decline in the euro. Popular exchange-traded funds, like Vanguard FTSE Europe and iShares Europe, lost 3.9 per cent and 3.2 per cent on the year, although dividend payments meant that shareholders just about broke even. European government bond yields have soared since the so-called Brexit vote, but they were still down for all of 2016, which means that bond prices, which move in the opposite direction, rose. The markets are taking political developments in stride, but that may not last. For while the people have spoken, they are not about to pipe down soon; national elections are scheduled this year in the two most important EU states: Germany and France. There are populist parties on the ballot in each that could achieve enough support to ruffle the markets. Many Europeans are frustrated with decades of economic stagnation exacerbated by a failure by leaders to confront barriers to prosperity like high taxes and rigid labor markets. With so much at stake, investment advisers warn, it would be foolish to downplay the dangers. Europe is suffering from “the rise of populist backlash against the establishment,” said Paul O’Connor, head of multiasset for Henderson Global Investors, a British company that manages $12.5-billion in assets in American mutual funds. “It feels as if it’s in its infancy, and it’s going to overshadow the next few years quite significantly.” Populist governments often spend lots of money on infrastructure projects and other programs intended to curry favor with the public, market strategists say. That enhances growth in the short run, and it may provide a notable boost for Europe by accelerating a nascent trend away from the austerity that many governments imposed during the debt crisis a few years ago. But the spending programs are often financed with borrowed money, something that Europe owes plenty of already, and the damage from the added debt usually outweighs and outlasts the benefits from the growth. Stock buyers lately seem to be focusing on the positive growth factors, while bond sellers are looking further ahead. “Typically, when a populist government gets elected, one of the first things it does is fiscal expansion” to promote job growth and voter confidence, said Markus Stadlmann, chief investment officer of Lloyds Private Bank. “What happens in the next phase of fiscal expansion is that it’s financed by government borrowing.” President-elect Donald Trump and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain have proposed programs of one sort or another that would serve this purpose, Mr. Stadlmann said. When the bill comes due, it is often in the form of higher interest rates or higher inflation. At that stage, he warned, “government is less in control, the deficit deteriorates, government spending is unsustainable, wages fall in real terms and there are capital outflows. That’s one of the reasons the bond rout has been really intense.” Another populist impulse that should worry investors is protectionism through tariffs or other curbs on foreign goods. The aim is to protect jobs, but most economists say that constraining trade limits competition and leads to higher consumer prices. One concern about Brexit is that Britain will lose access to the free-trade zone within Europe. Not only might British merchandise be hit with tariffs, but British companies might also have to pay more for European goods used in manufacturing. Mr. Stadlmann called the potential for trade disruptions “a big risk.” A potentially (if, at the moment, unlikely) catastrophic economic event that investment advisers say is not accounted for in asset prices is the departure from the European Union, or at least the euro, of the one indispensable member: Germany. If Germans wanted to leave the union — say, because of disenchantment with the influx of migrants or the assistance provided to weaker member states — it could do so. Germany has a more robust economy than its neighbors, and it runs a large current-account surplus with the world outside Europe (more money comes in than goes out), so it could replace the euro with a stronger currency, reducing the country’s debt burden, whereas a weaker country that left the eurozone might risk default. If Germany left, “the EU would be severely wounded, at best,” said William Porter, global credit strategist for Credit Suisse, adding, “Politics in the periphery is not what’s going to drive” developments in Europe. “It’s the core.” Mr. Stadlmann expressed similar thoughts, saying, “It’s not Spain and Italy that are different in the EU, it’s Germany.” He added that he is “not very negative on the EU holding together at the moment.” What investment advisers are very negative on when they consider the impact of rising populism is European bonds. “The re-pricing in government bonds is incomplete,” said Mr. O’Connor at Henderson, adding, “It’s plausible the bull market in fixed-income has come to an end.” Mr. Stadlmann likewise noted that the reversal of bond yields is “continuing and gaining speed.” As for other assets, he encourages being “very, very selective.” In particular, he favors stocks of German retailers and real estate companies. John Maxwell, manager of the Ivy International Core Equity Fund, is more optimistic on European stocks, especially on multinational companies that are cheaper than rivals based elsewhere and that are comparatively immune to politics. “If something goes wrong, it doesn’t mean Procter & Gamble is going to do better than Unilever selling detergent in Italy,” he said. Unilever is one portfolio holding that illustrates his point. Others are the energy company Total, British American Tobacco, the health care concern Smith & Nephew and Reckitt Benckiser, which makes household goods. Mr. O’Connor of Henderson prefers market segments that do well when inflation rises, including financial services and economically cyclical sectors like natural resources and consumer discretionary. Among the 10 largest holdings in the Henderson International Opportunities fund on Nov. 30, the last date for which holdings had been disclosed, were the French carmaker Renault, the British insurance company Standard Life and the German tire manufacturer Continental. But Mr. O’Connor’s support for European stocks in general is lukewarm, and with the penchant that European voters have shown for making surprising decisions with ramifications that will remain hard to gauge, taking big investment risks may start to look like carelessness. “Equities are the place to be, but I think it’s going to be a bumpy ride,” he said. While he finds that “momentum is gradually improving,” the inability to find lasting solutions to what does not work in Europe ensures that there will be “no very powerful bull script.” “There is a more plausible path to growth” in Europe, Mr. O’Connor said, “but it’s not enough to dispel some of the political things that are flaring up.” Report Typo/Error   More Related to this Story Pound skids on Brexit worry; investors hope for Trump clarity EQUITIES Britain's FTSE 100 on record-breaking streak in 'unbelievable start to the year' What high-net-worth investors should expect for 2017 Topics United Kingdom Oscar Wilde Europe Germany European Union Italy British American Tobacco plc Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Next story | Learn More Discover content from The Globe and Mail that you might otherwise not have come across.

REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer 5/5 By Valentina Za and Sudip Kar-Gupta | MILAN/PARIS MILAN/PARIS Italy's Luxottica (LUX.MI) and France's Essilor (ESSI.PA) have agreed a 46 billion euro ($49 billion) merger to create a global eyewear powerhouse with annual revenue of more than 15 billion euros. The all-share deal is one of Europe's largest cross-border tie-ups and brings together Luxottica, the world's top spectacles maker with brands such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, with leading lens manufacturer Essilor. "Finally ... two products which are naturally complementary -- namely frames and lenses -- will be designed, manufactured and distributed under the same roof," Luxottica's 81-year-old founder Leonardo Del Vecchio said in a statement on Monday. Shares in Luxottica were up by 8.6 percent at 53.80 euros by 1405 GMT (9:05 a.m. ET), with Essilor up 12.2 percent at 114.60 euros. The merger between the top players in the 95 billion eyewear market is aimed at helping the businesses to take full advantage of expected strong demand for prescription spectacles and sunglasses due to an aging global population and increasing awareness about eye care. Jefferies analysts estimate that the market is growing at between 2 percent and 4 percent a year, while Luxottica and Essilor say that at least 2.5 billion people in the world still suffer from uncorrected vision problems. The deal also removes -- for now at least -- uncertainty over succession at Luxottica, which has lost three CEOs since 2014 because of rifts with Del Vecchio. "The strategic rationale is strong," JPMorgan Cazenove analysts said in a note, adding that the deal defuses the risk of growing competition between two groups that had been encroaching on each other's areas of expertise in recent years, with Essilor buying online retailers and Luxottica investing in lens manufacturing. ONLINE FOCUS Both companies have been grappling with slowing sales growth, hit by weakness in North America, and face rising competition from cheaper rivals and the challenge of online distribution. While Asia and Latin America are seen by the companies as potential growth markets, e-commerce will also be a top priority. Luxottica's third-quarter results had showed revenue from its online platforms grew by 18 percent, with the company stating that e-commerce had been targeted as an area for accelerated growth in 2017. The third-quarter e-commerce growth far exceeded that for overall sales, which rose by 1.4 percent at constant exchange rates. The merger is expected to boost operating profit by up to 600 million euros in the medium term, the companies said. It will also leave smaller rivals lagging even further behind. Dutch retailer GrandVision (GVNV.AS) and Italy's Safilo Group (SFLG.MI) had revenue of 3.2 billion euros and 1.3 billion euros respectively in 2015. Though advisers on the deal have presented it as a merger of equals, Del Vecchio will be the biggest shareholder of the combined group with a stake of between 31 percent and 38 percent through his family holding company Delfin. Voting rights will be capped at 31 percent. Analysts said that Essilor shareholders are getting a good deal because the share exchange ratio implies a 5 percent discount to Luxottica's closing price on Friday, which was down 27 percent from its 2015 peak. Delfin will contribute its 62 percent stake in Luxottica at a ratio of 1 share in the Italian group for every 0.461 Essilor shares. The French lens maker will launch a mandatory exchange offer on all remaining Luxottica shares at the same ratio, with the aim of delisting Luxottica's shares. TWIN BOSSES The merged EssilorLuxottica will have 140,000 staff and will be headquartered and listed in Paris. It will also have a complex governance structure, with Del Vecchio and Essilor Chairman and CEO Hubert Sagnieres effectively sharing the driving seat, while the 16-strong board will have an even split of Essilor and Luxottica executives. A source close to the deal said no arrangements had been made at this stage for when Del Vecchio will retire. Del Vecchio, who returned to the helm of Luxottica two years ago after taking a back seat for the previous 10 years, will be CEO and executive chairman of the merged group. Sagnieres, 61, will serve as executive vice-chairman and deputy CEO, but he and Del Vecchio will have the same powers. In a conference call with analysts, the two sought to play down concerns over the co-leadership. "We have and share the same values, we have and share the same vision, we have and share the same interest in the product ... If we really want to provide consumers with the best product, Leonardo and I will have to co-manage," Sagnieres said. Del Vecchio, who grew up as an orphan but is now Italy's second-richest person, said he had long dreamed of such a merger. "This marriage will take place and will work," he said. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year and Del Vecchio said he is confident there will be no problems gaining approval from competition authorities. Luxottica and Essilor, which have a market value of about 24 billion euros and 22 billion euros respectively, had explored a possible tie-up a few years ago. Luxottica said in September 2014 that discussions had taken place in 2013 but were dropped for a number of reasons, including shareholding governance issues. A source close to the deal said that the two companies' business models, operations and strategy have converged since then and that the merger makes more sense now, given growing competition. The source said the tie-up had been agreed in the past six weeks. Mediobanca advised Delfin on the merger, with Essilor advised by Rothschild and Citi. Delfin's shareholders are Del Vecchio's six children and his second wife.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A      Italy's Luxottica and France's Essilor have agreed a 46 billion euro ($49 billion) merger to create a global powerhouse in the eyewear industry with annual revenue of more than 15 billion euros, they said in a statement on Monday. The deal, one of Europe's largest cross-border tie-ups, brings together Luxottica, the world's top spectacles maker with brands such as Oakley and Ray-Ban, with Essilor, the world's leading manufacturer of ophthalmic lenses. "Finally ... two products which are naturally complementary -- namely frames and lenses -- will be designed, manufactured and distributed under the same roof," Luxottica's 81-year-old founder Leonardo Del Vecchio said in a statement. Shares in both companies were up 14 percent at 0814 GMT (03:14 a.m. ET). By merging, the companies will be better positioned to take advantage of strong demand in a $95 billion market expected to achieve continued growth because of an aging global population and increasing awareness about eye care in Asia and Latin America. The companies said the deal is expected to bring annual revenue benefits and cost savings in the range of 400 million euros to 600 million euros in the medium term. Del Vecchio, who returned to the helm of Luxottica two years ago after taking a back seat for the previous decade, will be CEO and executive chairman of the merged EssilorLuxottica, which will be listed in Paris. Del Vecchio will take a stake of between 31 percent and 38 percent in the merged group through his family holding Delfin, becoming the biggest shareholder. Voting rights will be capped at 31 percent. Essilor Chairman and CEO Hubert Sagnieres will be executive vice-chairman and deputy CEO, with the same powers as the chairman and CEO. In a call with journalists on Monday, Sagnieres said the companies' combined operations will be able to offer a much faster service to their customers. Delfin will contribute its 62 percent stake in Luxottica at a ratio of 1 share in the Italian group for every 0.461 Essilor shares. The French lens maker, a long-time supplier to the Italian group, will launch a mandatory exchange offer on all remaining Luxottica shares at the same ratio, with the aim of delisting Luxottica's shares. GROWING MARKET Luxottica and Essilor, which have a market value of about 24 billion euros and 22 billion euros respectively, had explored a possible tie-up a few years ago. Luxottica said in September 2014 that discussions had taken place in 2013 but were dropped for a number of reasons, including shareholding governance issues. The companies expect rapid growth in the global eyewear market, saying that at least 2.5 billion people in the world still suffer from uncorrected vision problems. Luxottica has been dogged by management upheaval in recent years, raising questions over Del Vecchio's succession plans and strategy. Some insiders have said a merger could help settle such issues. A year ago Luxottica announced the departure of its third chief executive in 17 months when Adil Mehboob-Khan, a former Procter & Gamble executive, stepped down and Del Vecchio tightened his grip on the group by taking on executive powers. Long-standing CEO Andrea Guerra quit in 2014 after a rift with Del Vecchio. His successor, Enrico Cavatorta, left only six weeks into the job, also because of differences with Del Vecchio. Since taking the lead, Del Vecchio has stepped up investments to boost Luxottica's retail network and expanded its lens manufacturing business. However, revenue and profit growth have slowed in a tough U.S. market that contributes 59 percent of Luxottica's revenue while Del Vecchio has sought to increase control over pricing by limiting online discounts.

REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer 5/5 By Valentina Za and Sudip Kar-Gupta | MILAN/PARIS MILAN/PARIS Italy's Luxottica (LUX.MI) and France's Essilor (ESSI.PA) have agreed a 46 billion euro ($49 billion) merger to create a global eyewear powerhouse with annual revenue of more than 15 billion euros. The all-share deal is one of Europe's largest cross-border tie-ups and brings together Luxottica, the world's top spectacles maker with brands such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, with leading lens manufacturer Essilor. "Finally ... two products which are naturally complementary -- namely frames and lenses -- will be designed, manufactured and distributed under the same roof," Luxottica's 81-year-old founder Leonardo Del Vecchio said in a statement on Monday. Shares in Luxottica were up by 8.6 percent at 53.80 euros by 1405 GMT (9:05 a.m. ET), with Essilor up 12.2 percent at 114.60 euros. The merger between the top players in the 95 billion eyewear market is aimed at helping the businesses to take full advantage of expected strong demand for prescription spectacles and sunglasses due to an aging global population and increasing awareness about eye care. Jefferies analysts estimate that the market is growing at between 2 percent and 4 percent a year, while Luxottica and Essilor say that at least 2.5 billion people in the world still suffer from uncorrected vision problems. The deal also removes -- for now at least -- uncertainty over succession at Luxottica, which has lost three CEOs since 2014 because of rifts with Del Vecchio. "The strategic rationale is strong," JPMorgan Cazenove analysts said in a note, adding that the deal defuses the risk of growing competition between two groups that had been encroaching on each other's areas of expertise in recent years, with Essilor buying online retailers and Luxottica investing in lens manufacturing. ONLINE FOCUS Both companies have been grappling with slowing sales growth, hit by weakness in North America, and face rising competition from cheaper rivals and the challenge of online distribution.
