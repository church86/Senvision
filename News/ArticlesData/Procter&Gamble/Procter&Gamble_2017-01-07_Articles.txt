These stocks are what you're looking for. Dan Caplinger, Neha Chamaria, and Daniel Miller (TMFGalagan) Jan 8, 2017 at 8:02AM Investing in stocks involves risk, but smart investors manage that risk to identify stocks that have strong return potential with minimal chances of potential losses. That balance can result in market-beating returns over the long run without the same volatility you'll see in the overall market. Let's learn why Ford (NYSE:F), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), and Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED) deserve a closer look to see if they belong in your portfolio. Image source: Ford. Rev up your engines with Ford Dan Caplinger (Ford): One way to find top stocks with low risk is to look for companies that have solid prospects but that have had their share prices beaten down. Ford is a good example, with the automaker having gone through some recent challenges that have caused a dramatic downdraft for the stock over the past couple of years. Auto sales remain strong overall, but Ford has seen some difficulties with demand for some of its U.S. models, including the key F-150 pickup truck. In October, Ford had to idle four plants briefly in order to let demand catch up to inventory, and some worry that overall industry sales figures will have to fall from their recent heights in the years to come. For Ford investors, however, the stock already incorporates a great deal of that downbeat view. Shares currently trade at just seven times trailing earnings, and even though analysts expect somewhat of an earnings pullback for 2017, they don't see any threat to single-digit forward earnings multiples for the foreseeable future. That's a margin of safety you just won't find in many places in the stock market right now. With the potential to surprise on the upside with unexpected gains if sales don't deteriorate, Ford has a lot going for it right now. A leaner and meaner company Daniel Miller (Procter & Gamble): It's very likely you're aware of Procter & Gamble. After all, it's one of the world's largest consumer product manufacturers with a slew of household names, including Tide laundry detergent, Gillette razors, Charmin toilet paper, Pantene Shampoo, just to name a few. In fact P&G owns 22 brands that generate more than $1 billion in annual sales. If you're looking for a stable company with a long list of products that are necessities, this is a one-stop shop for investors looking for little to no risk. The good news for investors is that P&G is putting the finishing touches on slimming down its portfolio of products after entering too many markets in too many categories too quickly. It trimmed roughly 70% of its brands, now with only 65 of its best and most proven brands and reduced the categories it participates in by 60%. The strategy has been that as the company sheds under performing brands in more competitive categories its top-line growth would return. That was the case in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 as its total organic sales checked in at 3% with increases in 9 out of its 10 largest markets. Another reason that makes P&G much less risky than many stocks is its dedication to returning massive value to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. During fiscal 2016 P&G returned $15.6 billion to shareholders, and it expects that to reach $22 billion during fiscal 2017, and up to a staggering $70 billion between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2019. On top of that, management believes it can generate $10 billion in productivity savings between fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2021. P&G is leaner and meaner than it has been in recent years, and its focus on trimming brands and costs will ensure that its top and bottom line will continue improving in the near-term, and its focus on returning huge sums of capital to shareholders makes this one of the lowest risk investments in the market.  A defensive stock to suit your risk profile Neha Chamaria (Consolidated Edison): If you have a low appetite for risk, your best bet would be a defensive stock that can make you money regardless of the business cycle. One way to find such a stock is to look for companies that provide essentials, the demand for which doesn't ebb and flow with the economy. Utilities like Consolidated Edison is a perfect example. Having been around for almost two centuries now, Con Ed provides electricity and gas to more than ten million people in New York City and Westchester County. As the industry is highly regulated and has strong barriers to entry, Con Ed doesn't have to worry much about competition. To top that, Con Ed's rates are decoupled, which means its revenues are predetermined and don't depend on sales volumes. That's undoubtedly a huge advantage as it eliminates much of the uncertainty associated with profits and operating cash flows. For Con Ed investors, that has translated into 42 consecutive years of dividend increases. In short, two factors make Con Ed a low-risk stock: A stable, non-cyclical business and solid shareholder returns. If you're worried a regulated business might mean muted earnings growth, you can take heart in Con Ed's ongoing efforts to tap growth opportunities in non-utility and renewables, including battery storage, electric vehicles, solar, and wind. I believe this diversification should not only help Con Ed expand its customer base but also push its earnings higher in the years to come. Overall, Con Ed is the kind of stock that will let you sleep at night while it fills your coffers. Psst...the stock's dividend yield has consistently kept its head above the 3% mark in the past decade.  Dan Caplinger owns shares of Ford. Daniel Miller owns shares of Ford.

Looking around at her Labour colleagues from the 2015 parliamentary intake, the new MP for Dewsbury in West Yorkshire saw former special advisers and academic high-fliers with Oxbridge degrees. “I’d never been to university, so I felt completely out of my depth,” sighs Sherriff. “But then you find your way, you find your place. I’ll never be an expert in economics, but if you want somebody to get something through then I’m probably your girl because I’ve got this incredible northern grit.” The 41-year-old former Unison shop steward found her way pretty quickly and has become one of the breakout stars of the 2015 cohort. Last week, the Guardian revealed that Tesco had pledged to reduce the price of women’s twin-blade razors to the same as men’s at 50p for a pack of five following Sherriff’s pressure on the supermarket giant. Kari Daniels, Tesco’s commercial director, wrote to Sherriff to insist the products were not simply a different colour – pink rather than blue – but added that Britain’s biggest supermarket would act “on concerns about the difference in price”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Paula Sherriff. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian Tesco’s concession is already being viewed as one of the major victories in the war to end gender price discrimination on the high street. The news added just a little extra lustre to a short but glittering parliamentary CV that includes: persuading Boots to pilot a scheme to let customers gift sanitary products to food banks; forcing WH Smith to lower product prices in hospital shops to match those in high street stores; and making House of Commons history in her bid to abolish the so-called tampon tax. Sherriff joined the police at 18 and then spent 13 years in healthcare, but, as an MP she is defining herself as the champion of the shopper. She tweeted after the Tesco story broke: Paula Sherriff MP (@paulasherriff) Really pleased with this result. Chipping away at gender pricing bit by bit. Watch out retailers-I'm onto you! https://t.co/u7ZJlCEJwI January 1, 2017 Her efforts in highlighting gender price discrimination in clothes, beauty products and toys during a parliamentary debate, secured in her name last February, were noted by Jeremy Corbyn. Sherriff did not vote for him in either of his leadership election victories – she backed Yvette Cooper in 2015 and then Owen Smith last summer – but he still made her Labour’s women and equalities spokeswoman in October’s reshuffle. Fresh off her Tesco triumph, Sherriff will now push supermarkets and major brands to sign up to a charter pledging not to “knowingly impose” prices that rip-off women. Analysis suggests that products aimed at women are, on average, 37% more expensive than identical items marketed to men. “It’s time just to raise an awareness among retailers about the ‘pink tax’ or the ‘sexist surcharge’ or whatever you want to call it,” says Sherriff. “I just like the idea of asking them to not just talk about specific items but to sign up to this mentality. I just like the idea of shops saying: ‘We do not impose a sexist surcharge.’” The sexist surcharge – how women ​get ripped off on the high street Read more This month Sherriff will meet executives at Proctor & Gamble, which manufactures the Tampax and Always feminine hygiene brands, to talk about how it can help with The Homeless Period Campaign by donating sanitary products to shelters. An online petition aimed at P&G gathered nearly 70,000 signatures. This follows Sherriff’s success over the Tampon Tax last year, when she became the first opposition MP to amend a government’s budget. Sherriff was furious that tampons carry 5% VAT – or “vagina added tax” as she memorably described it to the House of Commons – because of European Union rules. At a birthday party for Clive Lewis, who is now shadow business secretary, Sherriff told senior party aide Nick Parrott that she was desperate to remove the rate altogether. Parrott devised a “long-shot” plan that allowed Sherriff two attempts at forcing the government to accept a zero rate. After narrowly losing the first time around, Parrott and Sherriff ambushed the government by making a Faustian pact with a group of Conservative Brexiters to sign an amendment to abolish VAT on tampons. This was tabled shortly before the finance bill debate took place, so that the Conservative whips had no time to persuade rebels to change their minds. The government had to adopt the amendment or face humiliating defeat. David Cameron headed to Brussels, where the UK and other EU members states were granted permission to abolish VAT on sanitary products. “All the major retailers have agreed in writing that they will pass the savings on to the consumer,” says Sherriff, proudly. Prior to this nugget of Commons’ history, Sherriff had already forced WH Smith to drop its prices in hospital shops. As a junior manager responsible for outpatient services in Wakefield, Pontefract and Dewsbury, Sherriff found out how chains would sell their products at a premium in hospitals. For example, people were paying 89p more for a bottle of water in a WH Smith shop in a Wakefield hospital than they would in Leeds city centre. WH Smith bowed to the pressure and lowered prices on items such as “get well soon” cards. Today, Sherriff is full of praise for the chain. “Stephen Clarke, who is the CEO, keeps in touch with me literally monthly, saying: ‘Look, if there are any problems, just let us know.’ It’s fantastic, all credit to them.” By contrast, Marks & Spencer refused to yield on its higher prices in hospital outlets, arguing it was impossible because they are run under franchise and forcing cuts would breach competition law. But M&S had better heed her Twitter warning: the high Sherriff of shops is preparing to ride into town once more and she isn’t about to let any major retailer escape her sights.

Home Industry Technology New age smartphone cameras: Not just selfies, detect anaemia, check food quality and more New age smartphone cameras: Not just selfies, detect anaemia, check food quality and more If you thought a smartphone camera was good enough to only click selfies, think again. From sensing food quality to screening for anaemia, there’s much more to the new-age smartphone camera than meets the eye. By: Nitin Sreedhar | Published: January 8, 2017 6:04 AM Researchers across the globe today have tweaked and developed smartphone cameras into tools that can do all this and more. (Reuters) THE LATEST report doing the rounds regarding the launch of iPhone 8 some time next year is that Apple is working with LG to develop a smartphone camera module that would enable 3D photography. This news is bound to send selfie-lovers into raptures. But while 3D photography on a smartphone, no doubt, is an exciting prospect, what if we were to tell you that there’s much more that some new-age smartphone cameras can achieve? How about using the camera on your phone to sense food quality, for instance? What if it could screen you for anaemia or help you brush your teeth better? Researchers across the globe today have tweaked and developed smartphone cameras into tools that can do all this and more. Detecting melanoma Melanoma is one of the deadliest forms of skin cancer, but if detected in the early stages, the chances of survival are remarkably high. Now, researchers are working on devising a new way to detect the disease not with blood tests, but with a smartphone camera. In an IBM Research blog post, cognitive computing and computer vision scientist Noel Codella mentions how, in the future, doctors and patients will be able to identify possible signs of melanoma with the help of skin image analysis. “Our vision is that taking pictures to diagnose melanoma might one day be as routine as drawing blood to detect other diseases. Equipped with a smartphone or any other camera attached to a dermascope, this type of technology would enable doctors, nurses or support staff to take a photo of a lesion, send it to a cloud-based analytics service and receive a detailed report,” Codella writes in the blog post. This report, Codella writes, could help a clinician determine whether the lesion has characteristics of melanoma or any other type of skin cancer. It would also contain other relevant information, which might further assist the medical staff in assessing a patient. Once implemented in clinical practice, this technology could be a game-changer since there are currently no reliable blood tests for melanoma. In 2015, the IBM Research team published preliminary research on this topic in which they explained the ability of computer vision approaches to help find disease markers in dermoscopy images. They have also directly compared the performance of these new methods to that of eight specialists. A well-established dermatologist, writes Codella, sees 25 or more patients per day. Assuming there are approximately 20 workdays in a month, this results in over 6,000 patients per year, with potentially multiple lesions observed in each patient. By comparison, writes Codella, the IBM system has seen fewer than 3,000 lesions, meaning its experience level is along the lines of a medical student. “But the hope is that, one day, the simple act of taking a picture could help clinicians quickly and accurately test for melanoma and other dangerous skin diseases,” Codella writes. The technology, however, remains a work in progress, as it requires more research and testing. The Genius 9000 toothbrush, developed by the Oral-B brand of Procter & Gamble, teaches people to brush more effectively with the help of their smartphone camera. Brushing teeth better The same camera that lets you click that picture-perfect selfie can now help you brush your teeth better. Wondering how? The Genius 9000 toothbrush, developed by the Oral-B brand of Procter & Gamble, teaches people to brush more effectively with the help of their smartphone camera. The toothbrush is fitted with a set of accelerometers that measure changes in motion in three dimensions, calculating even minute changes in brush angles. This is where the smartphone camera comes into the picture. All you need to do is download an app, created by P&G scientists and the Fraunhofer Society for the Advancement of Applied Research, on your smartphone. This app uses the smartphone’s camera and facial recognition technology to measure the position of the brush relative to the mouth—Oral-B has termed this ‘position detection’. Users just have to place their smartphone in front of them when they brush—they can attach it to the bathroom mirror using a suction cup holder that comes with the toothbrush, which is available online (R32,000). The app then shows a user which parts of the mouth have been brushed properly and which areas need more work. When a user starts brushing, the app displays a circle in six blue segments corresponding to the six areas of the mouth. As you brush each area, the blue fades, leaving a clean white segment. The app also remembers the user’s past 30 brushing sessions. The smartphone app that links to the brush can also be programmed by your dental professional to issue notes and reminders during and after a brushing session. But does it work? Well, initial data for the Oral-B Genius 9000 shows that some users now brush for 2 minutes and 24 seconds on an average, which is more than the recommended time of two minutes twice a day. Japanese tech giant Hitachi has developed a technology in which the smartphone camera can be used for such authentication. Finger vein reading Finger vein reading is a popular method of biometric authentication. A type of infrared light is transmitted through the finger and partially absorbed by hemoglobin in the veins to capture a unique finger vein pattern profile, which is then matched with a pre-registered profile to verify individual identity. Now, Japanese tech giant Hitachi has developed a technology in which the smartphone camera can be used for such authentication. As per the company, this is the first practical finger vein authentication technology that uses a phone’s camera. The use of colour information software makes this technology more effective than the infrared variant. Additionally, multiple fingers can be used in this technology, which improves accuracy—the colour and shape of fingers are registered in advance. The technology can even extract fingers from a background image. There’s also the provision of normalising finger postures, so that authentication can be done even when the angle of the hand changes. Hitachi tested the technology in-house. Pictures were taken using an 8-MP camera and transferred to a tablet computer for authentication. And even though the technology was used with Android, the company has plans to support iOS as well when it’s ready for commercial use. As per the company, this technology can replace the traditional means of authentication when it comes to financial transactions, online shopping and so on. What makes finger vein authentication more feasible is the security aspect. Biometric authentication methods such as fingerprints, voiceprint and facial recognition are prone to spoofing and can be forged easily. But finger vein authentication is impervious to security threats because one can’t possibly replicate vein patterns. Also, at the time of commercialisation, Hitachi plans to use a smartphone or a cloud server to carry out the authentication instead of a tablet. The answer comes from the University of Washington, where scientists have developed an application called HemaApp, which uses a smartphone camera (and the flash) to estimate haemoglobin concentration and screen for anaemia. Detecting anaemia Anaemia remains a major problem in developing countries. Take India, for instance. A recent National Family Health Survey found that over 55% of Indian women were anaemic. But how does a smartphone camera enter the frame? The answer comes from the University of Washington, where scientists have developed an application called HemaApp, which uses a smartphone camera (and the flash) to estimate haemoglobin concentration and screen for anaemia. All one has to do is focus the light from the camera’s flash on to a patient’s finger. HemaApp then analyses the colour of the blood. It continuously floods a patient’s finger with different wavelengths of light and infrared energy, and creates a series of videos. By analysing how colours are absorbed and reflected across those wavelengths, HemaApp can detect the concentration of haemoglobin and other blood components such as plasma. Researchers say they tested the app under three different conditions: using the smartphone camera’s flash alone; in combination with a common incandescent light bulb; and with a low-cost LED lighting attachment. The app correctly identified cases of low haemoglobin levels 79% of the time when used with just the phone camera. This number went up to 86% when the app was used with some additional light source. To ensure it worked on different skin tones, the team developed processing algorithms that use a patient’s pulse to differentiate between the properties of the patient’s blood and the physical characteristics of his/her finger, the paper said. As per the university website, HemaApp is not meant to replace traditional blood tests—which are more accurate—but researchers do believe that the app can be an effective and affordable initial screening tool to determine whether further blood testing is needed or not. As of now, the app is set for more testing. Some features, like fruit freshness, can also be seen from the spectral image without algorithms, but most applications usually require processing of the data. Check health, food quality Researchers from VTT Technical Research Centre in Finland have developed the world’s first hyperspectral mobile device by converting the camera on an iPhone into an optical sensor that can sense food quality, as well as monitor health. As per the VTT website, the cost-effective optical MEMS (micro opto electro mechanical systems) spectral technology enables the development of new mobile applications for environmental sensing and monitoring vehicles and drones—other uses include food analysis and health monitoring. “Consumer benefits could appear in health applications such as mobile phones that are able to check whether food is edible or moles are malignant,” says Anna Rissanen, research team leader, VTT. You May Also Want To Watch: Hyperspectral imaging provides access to the optical spectrum at each point of an image, enabling a wide range of measurements. The adjustable MEMS filter is integrated with the camera lens and its adjustment is synchronised with the camera’s image capture system. The hyperspectral sensor measures the data in each camera pixel of the target. This spectral data can be transformed into information about the measurement target by developing intelligent computational algorithms. Some features, like fruit freshness, can also be seen from the spectral image without algorithms, but most applications usually require processing of the data. The sensor can also verify product authenticity or identify users based on biometric data. The VTT website adds that the centre aims to work with companies to commercialise the tech and bring new innovative optical sensor products to the market in the future. They have already developed a wide range of new applications, including environmental sensing based on nano-satellites, drone applications for precision agriculture, forest monitoring, etc. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Globe reporters unearthed true tales of transformation and the catalysts may surprise you HAYDEN MAYNARD FOR THE GLOBE AND MAIL The Globe and Mail Last updated: Saturday, Jan. 07, 2017 3:54PM EST Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Comments Alicia Raimundo, a 27-year-old Toronto mental-health advocate and speaker who suffers from Asperger’s and anxiety, discovered that Pokemon Go was a godsend, motivating her to get her outside, talk to strangers and explore her city – all while reaching her exercise goals. I was first diagnosed with anxiety and depression after I tried to take my own life at the age of 13. I have intermittently seen therapists and counsellors, which led to a diagnosis of Asperger’s when I was in university. I am lucky to be relatively high functioning but I think people always knew that something was a little bit different with me – the difficulty understanding social cues and the inability to relate to or connect with other people in a meaningful way. Asperger’s affects my brain in a way that I didn’t intuitively pick up how to do this like a lot of other people did. That led to a lot of isolation and trouble maintaining friendships. I will go to pretty extreme lengths to avoid social interaction: I don’t go out all that often if I don’t have to. That Pokemon Go might benefit me was an afterthought – I just really like Pokemon. It gave me a good excuse to go outside and do something that wasn’t high pressure. Instead of going outside with lofty goals of talking to people or running 5K, I would go outside to catch a Pokemon that was nearby. I didn’t feel as much anxiety when I was getting dressed to go. It got me moving again: If you walked two or five or 10 kilometres, you would hatch eggs and get new Pokemon, and that was fun. I reached my calorie goals, my standing goals and my exercise goals. I find myself able to walk and run for longer distances. I feel healthier and better. What really affected me about this, though, was that everyone was being really passionate about something at the same time. I didn’t have to worry about being weird or seeming too “into” something: everyone around me was just as into this thing. Everybody was being fundamentally weird together. As told to Zosia Bielski Volunteering becomes a lifesaver Getty Images/iStockphoto Carl Wiese, 64, began volunteering as a meal-delivery driver for Humber Community Seniors’ Services in Toronto nearly 10 years ago. He says it saved his life. After 17 years, my marriage fell apart. That’s when I started getting real health problems. I was so unhappy and depression took over. I was also getting terrible irritable bowel syndrome, diarrhea every day, and aches and pains all over my body. I used to go hiking in the woods, for instance, and I’d walk for 20 miles. Now, I was at the stage where if I went a quarter of a mile, I was so sore and out of breath and tired and aching. Eventually, doctors decided that was fibromyalgia. I had been doing a little bit of volunteering at the Toronto Wildlife Centre, but it was becoming difficult for me to get there. From my home, it was two buses and a long walk. And I just couldn’t walk any more. I remembered my mom used to get Meals on Wheels whenever I went out of town on business. As a driving instructor, I would travel right across Canada for companies like DuPont, Kodak, Procter & Gamble and Hewlett-Packard. One day, coming home from the wildlife centre, I saw a sign on the window at Humber Community Seniors’ Services: Meals on Wheels drivers needed. And I thought, “Gee, my mom used to love that so much, I should go and try it.” Before I started volunteering at Humber, I had reached a point where I didn’t want to take my own life or anything, but I just wished I could just die. I was so unable to do all the things I so loved doing. The day I went in, everything started to change. I do believe it saved my life. Two amazing things happened. The first was the emotional support. The staff there were so supportive. And going to each house delivering the meals, I started to realize, “Wow, I’m not in as bad shape as I thought I was.” These people were inspiring me because they’re fighting their battles and doing so much to keep themselves alive. So I started thinking, “I’ve got to look after myself better.” One of the most important things was seeing the meals I was delivering and going, “Gee, that’s not how I eat.” McDonald’s, Harvey’s, Wendy’s was a typical dinner, especially once I became single again. So I started eating the same foods Humber serves, and boy, oh boy, each year, I got a little better and a little better. I ate more fruits, more vegetables. Now I never buy processed food, I buy fresh only. And now I’m in pretty good shape. I still have a bit of trouble walking distances or carrying anything, but it’s much better than I used to be. In the beginning, I was only able to volunteer one or two days a week. Now I go nearly every single day. I love doing the meals and if I can’t make it, I miss it. Mostly, it’s just the people. Meeting people, talking to people. You know, when they open their door and say, “Hi Carl, how have you been? I’ve missed you.” That makes you feel good. It makes you forget about your tummy ache and your headache. As told to Wency Leung Antidote via entrepreneurship Getty Images/iStockphoto Lindsay Brock, 31, of Peterborough, Ont., has anorexia nervosa. Her health has also been complicated by a recent diabetes diagnosis. Opening her own coffee shop, Amusé Coffee Co. in Peterborough, has helped her tackle her social anxiety and has motivated her to keep her condition in check. I’ve been told before “you’re resisting treatment, you’re not co-operating.” But you wouldn’t tell someone with cancer whose radiation isn’t working, “you’re just not co-operating with your treatment.” The reality is it’s the disorder that’s resistant. Eating disorders are very resistant to treatment. And the current models of treatment, from what I could tell from my own experience, are not effective. I was in the hospital for about six weeks. After I left, I still couldn’t go back to work and my medical state got worse. But I had only ever been a worker and I thrive in busy work environment, especially in management roles. I’ve always wanted to own my own business. On a whim, I found a used espresso machine. The price was really reasonable, and for whatever reason, I just took some money out of my savings and bought it. It’s a commercial machine and it sat in my kitchen for months. I didn’t know what I was going to do with it, it was just too big. But I started crunching some numbers together and put a solid business plan together. I started attending local networking events and small business workshops. That was in January, 2015. And by July 1, I had keys to a space. I had no idea that would happen. I just had to jump at every opportunity, and the more that happened, the more doors opened. It was all very motivating to try to keep myself well enough to work. If nothing else, opening my own business gives me a really positive outlook. I don’t have a lot of traction yet in the way of sales. But it’s rewarding in a lot of other ways. Eighty per cent of our business right now comes from regulars and we have a really amazing following. I’ve also built a really positive rapport with our business community here. It’s a little business family almost. So the social anxiety I was having during all the time I was off work and having trouble getting back out in the world, there’s been a huge improvement. Being my own boss and making all the rules, including menu items and everything, it’s restored some confidence. I’m hoping as that grows, the confidence will follow suit in other areas and will allow me to take better care of myself. I do all the baking for the shop. With my health condition, it does create some tension. But part of why I put myself in the position to bake is I do find it kind of therapeutic. Baking made me more comfortable to be around food and less phobic. It seems a little bit dark or morbid that I’m making all this food, but denying myself of having any. But it’s actually quite calming. There’s a mindfulness to baking. There’s accuracy in numbers and measuring, and an element of control. You have to be fairly rigid about ingredients. So it allows me to get out of my head a little bit. It keeps me in the moment because I have to be focused on what I’m doing as opposed to feeling preoccupied with what I’m feeling in my body. As told to Wency Leung Giving her body a break Getty Images/iStockphoto As an athletic teenager with a double-D chest, Cassie Rodriguez of Vancouver suffered from severe back pain until she had breast reduction surgery at age 20. Years later, her breasts returned to their original size after she went off the pill and had two children. But Rodriguez, now 32, says she would have the surgery again in a heartbeat. When I was 11, I was a 36C. That’s already a pretty tough time for a girl – all of the changes that you’re going through. Then there was the self-consciousness of having old men stare at you. I hated it. By the time I was in high school, I was a 36DD. I’m not a stick but I probably had a 27-inch waist. It was all in the chest. I was really athletic and into volleyball and things like that. I started to get major back pain probably when I was 14 or 15. It felt like really bad tightness and burning between my shoulder blades. I was going for regular massage appointments, trying to get the pain under control. I talked to my family doctor and it was definitely not tricky to get the surgery approved for coverage under the [B.C.] Medical Services Plan. But I still had to go into the specialist’s office and have before pictures done, and he had to do measurements on my clavicle and things like that. We talked about how big he thought I should be versus how big I thought I should be – we didn’t see eye to eye on that. He seemed to want me to be closer to a C, but I wanted to be a small B. I went along with what he said, and ended up a C. I think they removed about 8.5 pounds. I was definitely happy to have the majority of the weight gone. After the surgery, it was the worst car ride of my life getting home over all of the bumps in the road. But the recovery was easy, maybe two weeks. I was still a little hunched over because I had been that way for so long. Massage therapy helped loosen up the muscles so I could stand up better. After about three weeks, I started to feel relief in my back. Running felt much better. And my confidence really went up because I felt like my breasts weren’t the first thing people were seeing about me. Now I have back pain again. Around 2010, my breasts grew back. Sometimes that happens. I don’t know if it was a hormonal change or what – I did go off the birth control pill around that time. I don’t know yet if I’m done having kids, but unless my breasts go way down after I’m done nursing, I would like to have another reduction for sure. As told to Adriana Barton Meditation forges a makeover Getty Images/iStockphoto Michael Satok Wolman, a 59-year-old Toronto artist, was addicted to painkillers for more than three decades and suffers from fibromyalgia and multiple sclerosis. Practising mindfulness meditation has given him not only a way of dealing with his addiction but a whole new perspective as well. You’re craving all the time to get rid of the pain that’s always present and never satiated. I relate it to the myth of Sisyphus. It’s the stone of addiction. It’s like rolling it uphill every day trying to say, “I don’t want to be overcome by this. I want to free myself,” and every day the stone comes rolling back. I was introduced to a program at Toronto General Hospital to help people with chronic pain find alternatives to opiates. I just knew I could not keep willing the stone up the hill every single day and not feel crushed when it rolled back down. I had had enough. I had been on some form of opiate for 30 years. I thought, this has got to stop. I was absolutely chained to the clock. Every day I would be watching the clock to know when I could take my next round. I was put on a medication called Suboxone. The program also teaches mindfulness meditation. I didn’t think I’d be a good candidate for it. I thought the idea of mindfulness meditation where you’re in the present and you’re breathing and you’re focusing on things other than your problems wasn’t something I was going to respond to. But I found that it was an opportunity to focus in a certain way. I try to do it at least once a day for about 15 minutes. I can have that good moment and then be able to refer to it throughout the day. It calms the nerves. It’s given me an opportunity to change the way I thought about my pain. Taking so many painkillers all the time was for me a solution and this was different. This was me recognizing the most important thing that I’ve learned, and that is that I will never be pain-free. There will always be something that will hurt me. How am I prepared to live with it? I have to do it differently. My ability to focus on my art has increased a hundredfold. Mindfulness has given me the chance to engage more with my life. As told to Dave McGinn These interviews have been edited and condensed.

Daniel Patrick HANNON 1939 - 2017 Obituary Condolences Gallery Flowers HANNON, Daniel Patrick 77, loving husband to Chris, father, grandfather, brother, uncle, Santa, coach, and friend to all who graced his path, was lifted high, surrounded in love and light by his family on January 5, 2017 at the family home in Reily, Ohio. Born on July 27, 1939 to Christopher Francis (d) and Eva Catherine (d) (Hemioben) Hannon in Cincinnati, Ohio, Dan was the family patriarch and oldest brother to Tom, Mary, and Marjorie (d) and two half siblings, James (d) and Charlotte (d). A proud 1957 graduate of North College Hill High School, where he excelled at all sports, drama, honor society and was class president, Dan was swept off his feet and married Christine Ann (Seithel) Hannon on October 7, 1961 for a wonderful 55 years. Dan's family grew and grew over the years. He had a wonderful relationship with Chris's six sisters and three brothers and was the apple of his mother in-law Betty Lou's (d) eye. Dan's greatest accomplishment, his pride and joy were his seven children, their families and twelve grandchildren: Son, Patrick & Judy (Williams) Hannon - Sean and Samantha; Son, Timothy & Rhonda (Farrow) Hannon - Rebecca and Emily; Daughter, Elizabeth Hannon & Ty Manzo Andrew; Son, David & Kelly Hannon - Sara (Hannon) & Jonathan Jordan, Ryan and Kody; Daughter, Jeanne Hannon - Alex and Daniel Ross; Son, Paul & Melissa (Sizer) Hannon - Layla and Christopher; Son, Steven Hannon Snarf. Dan worked for 35 years at Proctor & Gamble's Miami Valley Labs making major contributions to the field of dermatohistopathology and the advancement of electron microscopy. His love of sports was prolific. In 2004 his children, on behalf of more than 400 children he coached, mentored or befriended, dedicated a plaque to the baseball complex at Reily School. It reads, "Coach Daniel P. Hannon, His love of children and baseball compelled him into service as a coach for over 30 years. He, with the help from family and friends, was instrumental in refurbishing this ball diamond and in reforming the Reily Baseball/Softball League in 1973." Dan was a master chess player and refereed high school football for 25 years, and served as the PTA and Booster president for decades. His legacy will live on each time an area child laces up their cleats, picks up a glove or tosses a football, as each ref blows her whistle and in every mother or father that smiles as their child makes a friend or treats another as they are the most special person in the world. That is how Dan treated everyone, with love, recognizing their humanity and potential. Because of his natural ability to inspire this greatness in everyone, to many, he is one of the greatest men to walk the earth. Please join the family on Monday January 9th in celebration and bereavement: Visitation - Ogle & Paul R. Young Funeral Home in Oxford 10AM-2PM; Celebration of Life Service - Kumler Chapel, Miami University, 3-4 PM; Memorial Gathering - Reily Community Center, 6096 Reily Millville Rd, 5-8PM In lieu of flowers please send a donation to the Hannon Family Charitable Fund at any US Bank or by mail to the Oxford Branch, 1 Lynn Avenue, Oxford, Ohio 45056.
