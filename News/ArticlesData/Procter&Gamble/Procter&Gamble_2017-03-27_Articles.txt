Students enrolled in the college’s international development program teamed up with Etobicoke-based humanitarian agency GlobalMedic on March 22 to assemble 1,700 of the kits — each of which contains water purification sachets and essential hygiene supplies donated by Procter & Gamble. Officials from GlobalMedic — which runs capacity-building programs in post-conflict nations — called the current devastation in Syria “unimaginable,” with millions of refugees fleeing the ongoing conflict left stranded in internally displaced camps inside Syria and in refugee camps in neighbouring countries. “The cost of basic necessities has skyrocketed, leaving these mobile populations with few resources to protect their health and safety,” GlobalMedic representatives said in a statement. “There is no reliable access to clean drinking water or essential hygiene supplies to protect Syrians from communicable diseases. Children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable. “It is therefore vital to provide immediate protection to these families.” To those ends, the family emergency kits, which will support 10,000 displaced Syrian refugees, will now be packed into sea containers, before being shipped and distributed to Syria and surrounding countries.

Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives create brand affinity in the minds of the larger society. It does not only have the concern of brand equity awareness among the larger society, but also leads to a positive brand image among potential consumers. An increasing majority of global private companies embrace corporate social responsibility, not only because it is the right thing to do, but also because it strengthens their brands. Investigations show that a chunk of majority of consumers would switch to a brand associated with the good cause. A new concept of co-donation has been triggered by some major companies in which they are giving donations that involve consumers by letting them co-donate or co-decide what kind of social responsibilities will be carried out, as happened with Pepsi Refresh. The percentage of brand value represented by corporate social responsibility is trending upward while all other identifiable contributors to corporate brand value, which includes advertising, market cap, and the industry in which a company competes appear to be declining. Consumers increasingly expect global companies to make a broader contribution to society. Prior studies concluded that consumers’ purchase decisions are positively influenced by socially responsible initiatives implemented by companies. In a recent survey, 79% of consumers would switch to a brand associated with a good cause. Speaking on this, Chief Executive Officer/Executive Creative Director of O seme Group, Isi Eromosele said; “co-donation and cause related marketing help promote competition, which in turn leads to corporate innovation. This is essential for developing sustainable products and promoting sustainable consumption around the world. For brands, it is an excellent way to show they care, taking the lead with innovative “give back” schemes.” According to him, “in the past, Procter and Gamble teamed up with UNICEF to introduce Nutristar, a powdered drinking product that addressed micronutrient malnutrition in some populations and by acquiring the PuR brand to bring low-cost water purification technologies to consumers in developing markets. The company also promoted better hygiene in at-risk communities and in return had the benefit of forming new markets for its products like soap and toothpastes.” He pointed out that; “exposure to any type of well-conceived promotional initiative for a brand leads to more positive feelings and judgments about the brand in a consumer’s mind. A promotional initiative emphasizing a brand’s affiliation with a social cause has a high degree of affinity. How much a given initiative will help or hurt a given brand will depend on the characteristics of its target markets.” “A high degree of affinity can enhance the effectiveness of a brand’s promotional initiative that increases the likelihood of consumers treating the initiative as an important and positively weighted attribute of the brand. However, when a promotional initiative does not mention an affiliation, consumers may weight a brand’s style of marketing as a negative attribute. “he noted. Further, he stated that, “consumers would weigh the style of marketing as positive with those types of affiliations that have alignment with a cause like cancer research, environmental protection or disaster relief. Moreover, a social-cause affiliation could also have a “halo effect” on how a brand is seen on other attributes, such as trustworthiness or quality. “ “Those initiatives in which the logic behind the brand’s affiliation can be easily recognized by most consumers typically produce a more positive effect on consumer brand judgments and feelings than initiatives with weaker fit. The management of socially responsible behavior is important because of its impact on the perception of the brand image. Enriching a brand with ethical and social questions increases its value. These associations influence the consumer in their assessment of its products and increased brand loyalty.” He added. On his part, a brand management consultant, Bernard Okhakume told Daily Times that; “there are many companies with CSR programs but not all leverage or communicate them to help consumers understand their values. Reputation Institute does an annual survey of companies with the highest reputation scores for CSR initiatives. Google, Microsoft, The Walt Disney Company, BMW and Apple scored the highest in 2014. Not surprisingly these companies are some of the most successful in their market category. According to the Reputation Institute’s website “Firms with better CSR reputation have a much higher ability to foster desired supportive behaviors among consumers, including buying their products, recommending their company, or trusting the company to do the right thing when faced with difficulties or disruptions.” According to him, “there is an old (and maybe weird) saying that “the camel’s nose is in the tent”, meaning you cannot deny or turn this trend around. CSR is in the tent and is impacting how investors, consumers, activists, and communities respond to brands with not only with their wallets but with their employment choices, their influence, and their consumption and purchasing behaviors.” Stressing the importance of communication in corporate social reasonability, he disclosed that; “successful CSR strategy is one that is shared, nurtured and communicated consistently to all stakeholders and shareholders. It is also important for companies to engage the services of experts when to handle their CSR activity for purpose of brand affinity” He also said that, “companies that have made Corporate Social Responsibility a central part of their businesses are reaping the benefits, such as improved brand image. It works best for those companies in which social responsibility is a core company value and informs all aspects of the business.” For him, Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives are not only about philanthropy but translating these ideas into practical business strategies. Corporate Social Responsibility driven efforts does not only relate to donating money but it talks about integrating social and ethical practices into business strategies that help the consumer in creating a positive brand image. “With the increase in corporate social responsibility awareness, some companies promote a very elementary understanding of corporate governance and ethical standards. Another important aspect of corporate social responsibility is that it channels funds of socially responsible investors into promoting corporate social responsibility among investors.” He said. Speaking further, he disclosed that, “corporate social responsibility initiatives are not only about philanthropy but translating these ideas into practical business strategies. Corporate Social Responsibility driven efforts does not only relate to donating money but it talks about integrating social and ethical practices into business strategies that help the consumer in creating a positive brand image. With the increase in corporate social responsibility awareness, some companies promote a very elementary understanding of corporate governance and ethical standards. Another important aspect of corporate social responsibility is that it channels funds of socially responsible investors into promoting corporate social responsibility among investors.” “The content of corporate social responsibility creates an emotional connection with consumers and builds connections between the brand, its corporate social responsibility initiatives and the viewers. Promoting brand image with the help of corporate social responsibility initiatives encourages positive comments and ultimately has a positive effect on the brand, because the company is being transparent about its external communications and internal practices which show alignment,” he added.

The lightweight packaging is made entirely of post-consumer materials such as milk and orange juice containers, and morning coffee lids. The box is produced from a single process Polypropylene with no added chemicals. The modular design allows it to be used as a stackable, interlocking component of a product display or storage system, Nike says. “These are all intentional features and qualities which revolve around the intent of every Miniwiz product — reducing the impact on the environment in every way it can,” Huang said in a statement. “In this case, we’re adding features and efficiency to an existing product (shoe boxes) and by re-using non-virgin materials in a sustainable and responsible way.” The package can also be used as a backpack and is recyclable. Nike begin using the shoe box for its  NikeLab Air Max 1 Royal in China this month and will launch the product and its sustainable packaging globally next month. Nike’s announcement comes as several leading companies are employing circular economy approaches to creating new packaging from various waste streams. In January Procter & Gamble, in partnership with recycling and environmental management companies TerraCycle and Suez, developed the world’s first recyclable shampoo bottle made from up to 25 percent recycled beach plastic. Late last month Dell developed the technology industry’s first packaging trays made with 25 percent recycled ocean plastic content. Sustainable packaging can help companies save money on material and transportation costs, while also reducing their environmental impacts. Plus, it is becoming increasingly popular among consumers. For these reasons the global demand for recyclable, bio-based and other sustainable packaging types will reach about $440.3 billion by 2025, growing at a compound annual growth rate of around 7.7 percent, according to a Research and Markets report.

PinItInstapaperPocketEmailPrint <a href="//americanprospect-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=4ea03cc6b7f8a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"><img src="//americanprospect-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=92678&cs=4ea03cc6b7f8a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> (Photo: AP/Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen There’s no story that better illustrates the power of the growing anti-Trump grassroots resistance movement than Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen’s about-face on the president’s health-care bill. Frelinghuysen’s defection was a major victory for a new liberal grassroots movement that sprung up in his affluent New Jersey district soon after Donald Trump’s surprise November victory, and pressured him to change his vote. As chair of the House Appropriations Committee, Frelinghuysen is a key member of House Speaker Paul Ryan’s leadership team. The New Jersey Republican has been an important ally on the president’s policy initiatives. Like other party stalwarts, he repeatedly pledged to support Trump and Ryan’s Obamacare “repeal and replace” bill. But just hours before Ryan scheduled a vote on their American Health Care Act last Friday, Frelinghuysen threw the administration a curveball. Calling the legislation “unacceptable,” Frelinghuysen said in a statement that he planned to vote against it. His change of heart doomed the bill’s prospects, signaling to other House Republicans that they could defy Ryan’s leadership and Trump’s threats to punish them. Acknowledging defeat, Ryan pulled the bill before Republican House members had to cast their votes. Overall, 33 Republicans brought the bill down. Until this bill, Frelinghuysen had fallen in line with Trump and Ryan on every vote during this congressional session. The burgeoning movement, spearheaded by the NJ 11th for Change coalition, kept the heat on Frelinghuysen with weekly protests against the bill and a not-so-veiled threat to run a Democrat against him next year. Upset that Frelinghuysen hadn’t held an in-person town hall meeting in three years, NJ 11th for Change also sponsored five “Where’s Rodney?” town hall gatherings in Morristown, Little Falls, Sparta, Livingston, and Boonton—and invited the congressman.  He didn’t show up to any of them. But each time, hundreds of voters did, and organizers responded to Frelinghuysen’s absence with a cardboard cutout cartoon likeness of the 70-year-old “seated” in a chair. Stung by the group’s success in drawing media attention, but still unwilling to attend in-person meetings with his constituents, Frelinghuysen instead held several lightly publicized “telephone town halls” in March. The night before the scheduled vote, NJ 11th for Change staged a symbolic seventh birthday party for Obamacare outside Frelinghuysen’s Morristown office. After Frelinghuysen’s announcement about his “no” vote, NJ 11th for Change issued a statement explaining that it had “organized a sustained effort with thousands of our members—calling, visiting, mailing, faxing, and showing up [at Frelinghuysen's office]— all urging him to vote against taking health care away from more than 30,000 fellow constituents.” Montclair resident David Rosenberg created the NJ 11th for Change Facebook group one week after the presidential election, “after the shock wore off,” he says. At the outset, there were only three members, but that number skyrocketed to 7,000 by early March, and included many independents and Republicans.  “When we started, I thought we’d have ten people sitting around, having coffee, bitching and moaning,” Rosenberg tells The American Prospect. “But people are coming out of the woodwork. They’re saying, ‘I want in. How can I help?’” He adds, “Our mission is to hold Rodney accountable and let people know where he stands.” Since January, the group has organized weekly “Fridays with Frelinghuysen” protests outside his Morristown district office. The group gathers at a nearby Starbucks before walking over to Frelinghuysen's office, bringing pastries for his office staff and messages opposing his stances on key issues. As many as 400 people have shown up. Frelinghuysen’s support for “repeal and replace” was only one of the issues that brought hundreds of people to NJ 11th for Change’s protests and monthly meetings. The group has challenged him on immigration, the elimination of federal funding for Planned Parenthood, the overturning of environmental regulations, and the loosening of restrictions on gun purchases by people with mental illnesses. Organizers have also joined forces with Planned Parenthood, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), the Working Families Party, New Jersey Citizen Action, Clean Water Action, and Blue Wave New Jersey, a coalition of progressive activists. Most of NJ 11th for Change’s members are political neophytes, according to Rosenberg, himself a newcomer to activism. The group arranged a Skype session to discuss strategy with Indivisible founder Ezra Levin, whose “how to” guide for protesting against and defeating Republicans has spawned more than 5,000 local groups around the country. “We’ve all read the Indivisible manual,” Rosenberg says. “We know we have to apply the Tea Party tactics, but be more respectful. We’re angry and fed up and we’re making ourselves known. Frelinghuysen is out of touch with the people in our district.” The coalition plans to educate voters about Frelinghuysen’s record and to register new voters.  Frelinghuysen is the scion of a prominent New Jersey family whose history dates to back to the Revolutionary War. He is the sixth member of his family to serve in Congress. Frederick Frelinghuysen, his great-great-great-great-grandfather, was one of the framers of New Jersey’s first constitution and served in the U.S Senate. His father, Peter Frelinghuysen Jr., also a Republican, served in Congress from 1953 to 1975, representing much of the same affluent suburban Morris County and its environs that his son does today. One of the wealthiest members of Congress, Rodney Frelinghuysen is the heir to the Ballantine Brewery and Procter & Gamble fortunes.   Between 1994 and 2014, Frelinghuysen won between 58.8 percent and 72 percent of the vote in his district. But his victory last year, with 58 percent of the vote, was his lowest margin ever. Trump, meanwhile, beat Hillary Clinton by less than 1 percentage point—48.8 percent to 47.9 percent—in the district. For most of his congressional career, Frelinghuysen was a moderate Republican, but in recent years has moved to the right. He and his wife used to donate money to their local Planned Parenthood chapter, and he voted to fund Planned Parenthood in 2007, 2009, and 2011. But in 2015, he began voting against funding. Frelinghuysen only belatedly realized that backing Trump had eroded his support in the district, which led to his speedy U-turn on health care. Long considered a safe Republican stronghold, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) put the 11th District, along with three other New Jersey House seats currently held by Republicans, on its target list of 59 battleground districts where the party intends to make a stand in 2018. West of New York City, the 11th, with a per capita income of $48,898, is one of the wealthiest congressional districts in the country. Democrats hope to exploit the backlash against Trump to defeat Republican House members who sided with the president. To neutralize most of Trump’s initiatives, the Democrats need to gain 24 seats to win a House majority. No Democrat has emerged yet to run for the seat, but Rosenberg is confident that several will compete in next year’s June party primary. “This is now a swing district,” he says, “and it can be swung to the Democratic side.”     PinItInstapaperPocketEmailPrint You may also like The Hidden Monopolies That Raise Drug Prices David Dayen How pharmacy benefit managers morphed from processors to predators Will Suburban Activism Pave the Democratic Path to the House?

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Industry Going digital: How a strong online presence can give brands the power to reach consumers effectively Going digital: How a strong online presence can give brands the power to reach consumers effectively 'Some companies favour the traditional over creativity when building a website. While the website aims at informing readers of your products and services, it need not be boring. Tell a story!' New Delhi | Published: March 28, 2017 3:50 AM ‘Social media helps consistently interact with the target audience and mould their thinking. A case in point, the Dumb Ways To Die campaign by Melbourne Metro’ In 2012, Maggi launched a campaign, Main aur Meri Maggi, which involved customers narrating unique and personal stories about the noodle brand. It struck a chord with Indian audiences. The brand relied on the traditional route — television, radio and outdoor media — instead of the digital channel. The campaign ran successfully until 2015, when it was banned for about five months due to high lead and MSG content. The brand had to rethink its strategy and came up with the We Miss You Too campaign, to earn back its loyal customer base. The messaging was simple — Maggi is better now, but stays delicious. There was one noteworthy difference between both campaigns. The comeback campaign invested heavily on digital acceleration over traditional. The brand engaged with customers through social media, mainly YouTube. The concept was not just digital media, but of competing in a digitally-connected age. It illustrates how digital has led to a tectonic shift. It has levelled the playing field and the top dog no longer has a greater advantage over a challenger brand. The biggest advantage of online media is that the world is shrinking into a global village. It is helping brands reinvent customer thinking through innovative and content driven strategies. Here are a few tips to help you build a strong online presence and mould customer thinking: Great website Some companies favour the traditional over creativity when building a website. While the website aims at informing readers of your products and services, it need not be boring. Tell a story! Tell the reader about the most defining moments of your business, but keep it brief and crisp. Use visuals, but don’t be afraid of white space either. The company website must be updated as static information will not serve your purpose. You May Also Want To Watch: Content is king A common element in all successful campaigns has been strong content. A powerful online campaign by P&G’s Always, titled #LikeaGirl is a testament to that. The campaign was created to change the bad connotation associated with the phrase ‘Like a girl’. The brand made several videos showing what the phrase means to several adults, educating the viewer that it should be associated with strength. For challenger brands, content plays a crucial role. Challenger brands can be bold and slightly controversial content can work in their favour. Tap the influencers Influencers are an excellent conduit to communicate the desired message. The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge shows what an integral part influencers play in making online campaigns a success. Notable people like Mark Zuckerberg, former US President Barack Obama, and many celebrities participated in the challenge helping raise millions of dollars. Use social media effectively Social media helps consistently interact with the target audience and mould their thinking. A case in point, the Dumb Ways To Die campaign by Melbourne Metro. The campaign was aimed at raising rail safety awareness and used a melodic music video featuring animated creatures who die in comically unintelligent ways. The idea was to highlight that the train moves in a predictable fashion and accidental death due to trains is possibly the dumbest way to die. The campaign was a roaring success globally and the video became viral on social media. Blogging Blogging frequently can help change customer thinking. Blogs need not be solely about your business. If you are a life insurance company, you can write educative blogs about the need for insurance and how it benefits an individual. Use online ads A 30-second film can help change customer thinking about your product. When you use Google, Facebook or Bing ads, you also increase your SEO for local and national searching. Find the forums To reinvent customer thinking, use online forums. You should post there and listen to what groups are saying about your product, service or industry. You can post ideas to change customer thinking about your product and service. Contests Online contests are becoming popular and the use of social media can allow you to be creative and have a fun interaction with your target audience.

The funds will be used to improve its technology and expand its sales team, a statement yesterday said. The funding round was led by Vickers Venture Partners and existing investors, including Wavemaker Partners and SPH Media Fund - the corporate venture arm of Singapore Press Holdings. Snapcart gives shoppers cashback or rewards for submitting photos of their receipts. Its technology reads receipts with minimal human intervention. The company uses artificial intelligence to generate real-time consumer insights from these receipts for advertisers and brands. The data from receipts is fed into a proprietary analytics platform, which can provide brands with reports on real-time consumer spending and shopping habits. The company operates out of Jakarta in Indonesia, and expanded to the Philippines last August. It is in the process of exploring several new markets - including Singapore - with plans to launch over the next 12 months. "We believe we are disrupting the way market research is traditionally done, especially in the brick-and- mortar stores which contribute over 95 per cent of total grocery sales," said founder and chief executive Reynazran Royono. Snapcart has worked with a number of major consumer goods companies, including L'Oreal, Nestle, Unilever, Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble. "In the next 12 to 18 months, we want to focus on product development and client acquisition. We are confident that with the successful completion of this fund, we are on the right path," added Mr Royono. This is SPH Media Fund's second investment in Snapcart - it took part in a US$1.7 million round announced in January last year. A version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on March 28, 2017, with the headline 'Snapcart raises $4m in funding round'.

 Why you won't see Unilever announcing it is pulling its ads from YouTube Lara O'Reilly Mar. 27, 2017, 6:38 AM 2,848 facebook linkedin twitter email print Unilever chief marketing and communications officer Keith Weed.Unilever Unilever's marketing chief Keith Weed has long been vocal about the need for digital platforms to be more accountable around what he dubs the "3Vs": Value, viewability, and verification. But despite the high-profile disquiet around brand ads appearing next to extremist content on YouTube, Weed says Unilever — which owns brands including Axe, Magnum, and Lipton — won't be joining the growing list of global advertisers saying they are suspending their campaigns from Google's video ad platform. Speaking to Business Insider and a small group of journalists (a briefing also attended by Google's Europe boss Matt Brittin) ahead of Advertising Week Europe, which took place in London last week, Weed said: "The best way to do negotiations with any supplier is one-on-one and in private, so you won't find us coming out and making public statements." Weed did reveal that Unilever and Google had "an incredibly difficult conversation" about viewability — the measure of which an ad had the ability to be seen by a human — two years ago, which "did affect then what I was willing to invest in YouTube." Historically, Unilever also took issue with Google and other platforms like Facebook and Twitter over verification and their willingness to open its platforms up to third-party measurement firms. A conversation with Google's head of product at its headquarters in Mountain View in 2014 led to Weed coming up with the phrase "marking your own homework" — or "grading your own homework" in the US, he joked. The phrase has since been adopted by a number of prominent figures in the advertising industry — including WPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell — when calling for digital platforms to provide greater transparency over their metrics. Speaking with Business Insider after the briefing, Weed said: "The debate back then was I want to be able to understand what counts as a view and then, within that, what third-party verification was in place for me to be able to say that it's a definite view and that they are not marking their own homework. A view on some platforms not so long ago was just an ad being served. So if you were on a PC and you were looking at the top of the page, an ad was being served at the bottom of the page [where a user may not scroll], you were paying for that. I hasten to add, Unilever wasn't, but I can guarantee a huge amount of people were." Weed says the current industry-standard for a view — 50% of the pixels of an ad seen for 1 second or more — doesn't go far enough. He says a view should be 100% of the pixels seen. On video, he says half of the ad must have been watched to count as a view — versus the industry-standard of 50% of the pixels for 2 continuous seconds. "I was saying [back during discussions with Google in 2015] I'm not taking a stance against YouTube or any other platform, I'm taking a stance about what I'm willing to pay for. This is my criteria, if you don't match that criteria, at the end of the day, it's Unilever dollars. If you don't match that criteria, that's fair enough. But our dollars will follow where that criteria exists," Weed said. Marc Pritchard, the chief marketing officer at consumer goods giant P&G, delivered two landmark speeches earlier this year in which he gave its agencies and suppliers a year's notice to get audited and open themselves up to accredited third-party verification services. Media agency The&Partnership's founder Johnny Hornby said advertisers and agencies should set a "Cannes deadline" — referring to the Cannes Lions advertising industry event that takes place in June — for Google and Facebook to sort out issues such as ad fraud and ad misplacement, or else the industry should cut its spend on those platforms Weed said the progress digital platforms have made on those types of areas over the past couple of years has been "fantastic," although they are still not where they should be. But he doesn't plan to put an public deadline on his demands, like his biggest competitor has. Instead, Unilever is giving individual companies separate, private deadlines. Industry-wide definitions run the risk of lowering the bar, so that everyone else can step over it, Weed explained. "What you won't catch me doing as I've seen some people saying: 'The industry must address this by September' or something. These are unrealistic expectations to set out. Does the industry as a whole need to put more pressure on media companies to resolve this quickly? Absolutely. Do I applaud more people getting involved in this conversation and holding the industry to account? Absolutely. The more people that understand and make the right choices the better," Weed said. While Unilever is working to hold media companies to account for the quality of ad inventory they offer on their platforms, Weed said it's also incumbent on marketers to protect themselves. Unilever uses third-party verification services that check websites before it places ads on them to make sure they will be appearing in safe environments. It's something the company has been doing for years and one of the reasons why he is surprised discussions around brand safety, verification, and ad fraud seem to be flaring up right now. Weed said: "I reflected recently on why does there seem to be more press about it? Maybe just more people caught on to what was going on and that also includes journalists ... I think this is a little concerning because this is a fast moving world ... and in a fast moving world, I think everyone needs to keep themselves tooled up and sharp with what's going on ... Some of the comments I'm seeing in the press right now, it's easy to blame one person, and they [Google] have the biggest accountability, but we all need to do our homework." For its part, Unilever puts all its 5,500 marketers — from junior employees to its executive committee — through compulsory digital training modules on subjects such as SEO or big data. If they fail, they must complete the test again. Weed said: "Marketers need to tool up. I'm a great believer in building capabilities and skills. There isn't a football team that sits around eating crisps and drinking beer all week that then gets up on a Saturday morning gives it their best. No, they train and they coach. I think if you want to be an elite marketer, just like if you want to be an elite footballer, you need to train and coach." Get the latest Google stock price here.

The funds will be used to improve the company's technology and expand its sales team, a statement yesterday said. The round was led by Vickers Venture Partners and existing investors including Wavemaker Partners and SPH Media Fund - the corporate venture arm of Singapore Press Holdings. Snapcart gives shoppers cashback or rewards for submitting photos of their receipts. Its technology reads receipts with minimal human intervention. The company uses artificial intelligence to generate real-time consumer insights from these receipts for advertisers and brands. The data captured from receipts is fed into a proprietary analytics platform, which can provide brands with reports on real-time consumer spending and shopping habits. The company operates out of Jakarta, Indonesia and expanded to the Philippines last August. "We believe we are disrupting the way market research is traditionally done, especially in the brick-and-mortar stores which contribute over 95 per cent of total grocery sales," said founder and chief executive Reynazran Royono. Snapcart has worked with a number of major fast-moving consumer goods companies including L'Oreal, Nestle, Unilever, Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble. "In the next 12 to 18 months, we want to focus on product development and client acquisition. We are confident that with the successful completion of this fund, we are on the right path," added Mr Royono. This is SPH Media Fund's second investment into Snapcart - it previously also took part in a US$1.7 million round announced in January last year.
