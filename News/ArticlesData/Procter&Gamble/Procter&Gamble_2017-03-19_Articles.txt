A digital marketing CEO’s prescription to cure advertising fraud As the threat of ad fraud continues to loom over digital marketers, columnist James Green lays out the ingredients we need to promote transparency and drive the industry forward. James Green on March 20, 2017 at 10:27 am More Challenges around viewability, media metrics and transparency in the advertising inventory supply chain have festered for more than a decade, and they’ve recently hit a fever pitch. We see marketers increasingly demanding accountability for their digital media spends and looking for transparent and standard metrics to support digital advertising effectiveness. They’re fed up with ad fraud and waste in the supply chain — and so am I. A wake-up call was issued by Procter & Gamble’s chief brand officer in late January at the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s Annual Leadership meeting. Marc Pritchard, marketing leader of the world’s biggest advertiser, lambasted the digital ad industry for creating poor experiences for consumers, and highlighted media and tech giants Facebook and Google for lack of transparency on the performance of campaigns on their platforms, along with uneven inventory quality. Pritchard asserted that he doesn’t “want to waste time and money on a crappy media supply chain” and urged the industry to fix issues his company has been demanding for over a year. Undeterred, at an Association of National Advertiser meeting in February, he took up the issue again. When a behemoth like P&G talks, its impact as a change agent isn’t likely to be ignored. Most recently, Pritchard said Facebook and Google’s agreement to submit to audits by the Media Rating Council is not enough, and that agencies must offer more transparency around audit results. My reaction to Pritchard’s charges? Good for him — and for us. The more we all rally around change in a complicated and fast-moving industry, the better. Here’s another smoldering issue: Brand marketers’ ads are increasingly being served up on inflammatory media websites like Breitbart News. There is a striking lack of, or ineffectiveness of, safeguards for brands that need to know where their ads are running. Marketers want their ads running in “brand-safe” and contextually relevant environments, but when buying ads on open exchanges, there are no guarantees where the ads will run. According to a New York Times article, investment advisory firm Vanguard was clued into its ads showing up on Breitbart, not by its advertising agency but by a client. Not exactly the kind of call Vanguard was hoping for. As CEO of a company with a marketing platform for ad, email and site personalization, I’ve had a front-row seat to these issues as they’ve unfolded in our industry. I’ve also experienced endless “the buck stops with me” moments while trying to face head-on the challenges of this complex industry. So, here’s my “prescription” to move us forward: Ingredient One: What’s our version of the Lemon Law? If you’ve ever bought a car and encountered persistent problems caused by the manufacturer, you’re likely familiar with a law on the books in the US called the “Lemon Law.” This legislation is intended as a remedy for purchasers who, by no fault of their own, purchased a defective product. I am not proposing a Lemon Law per se, but a way to legitimately address a brand’s concern over paying for a “defective” advertising campaign (i.e., you shouldn’t pay for an ad that isn’t seen). Instead, the advertising industry hides behind the “contractual clause” excuse or complicated jargony explanations Pritchard rails against. Specifically, sellers of media need to be responsible for the ads they sell, and that should trickle down from the top to the bottom of the value chain. Thus, if I sell an inappropriate ad impression to an agency or brand, they shouldn’t pay for it. But if I bought that impression from an ad exchange, then I shouldn’t pay for that impression. And then, of course, the ad exchange shouldn’t pay the original seller. That is not how it works today. If I buy an ad, and an agency says it’s not viewable, I don’t get the revenue, and I still pay for the purchase, which means the seller still makes money. When the seller is selling fraud, that’s just not right, and it encourages more bad behavior. Ingredient Two: Be our own change agents and agree to universal standards When I look at what’s happening around the world and here in the US as people vie for change, I see action, not talk. Grassroots initiatives are popping up everywhere to push for change. In politics, we see people putting a stake in the ground defining non-negotiable issues. More people are preparing to run for local or state elected office having never served before. Indeed, we have a president who was elected at least in part because millions of people felt forgotten and wanted a revolution rather than more of the same. I’m hoping that we’ll see similar enthusiasm in our industry. We should be the ones to drive change, not be driven by it. This needs to start with agreeing to viewability standards, rather than opining on why they won’t work. P&G is adopting the MRC standard. It may not be perfect, but it’s a start. Our industry has evolved dramatically over decades — and so can our standards, so long as we define them. Ingredient Three: Consensus-driven industry guidelines and individual ethics We need consensus-driven industry guidelines and must adhere to an “honor code” of sorts to responsibly regulate ourselves within the industry. Every person, no matter what function or title, can live up to this honor code. What stops one from making an unethical choice? Generally, it’s our individual moral compass. For example, our company sees and uses data on the way people behave and engage, but we made the decision not to collect data on medical status or history, or any personally identifiable financial information. It’s reasonable to think there are companies that could utilize this data, but we don’t believe it is ethically appropriate. This is in line with IAB guidelines. I am reminded of the Charles Dickens novel, “A Tale of Two Cities,” and its most famous line, “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.” It was, of course, the age of wisdom and “the best of times,” and yet at the same time it was the age of foolishness, “the worst of times.” We are lucky to be in an industry that reaps the benefits of imagination and rigor of data science. As an industry, we have come so far and have many great advancements ahead of us. We need a cure that encompasses industry-wide reform, or future foolishness will win out.

Matthew DiLallo, Demitrios Kalogeropoulos, and Daniel Miller (TMFmd19) Mar 20, 2017 at 8:10AM The first valuation metric most investors learn is the price-to-earnings ratio, which is simply a company's stock price divided by its earnings per share over the past year. It's such a popular metric that most finance websites already calculate it for investors. However, while it's the gold-standard valuation metric for most investors, it's always a good idea to have a few more tools in your toolbox when researching stocks.  With that in mind, we asked three of our contributors which valuation metric they thought was the most important. While they all noted the value of the P/E ratio, they thought that price-to-sales, debt-to-equity, and enterprise value-to-EBITDA were even more important. Here's why. Image source: Getty Images. Focus on revenue Demitri Kalogeropoulos (price-to-sales): There are good reasons the P/E ratio is so popular with investors, given that it neatly captures how many years of profits you're paying to buy a business. When valuing a stable and predictable earnings stream, that metric can speak volumes. Consider Costco (NASDAQ:COST), which generates between 1.5% and 2% of sales in earnings each year thanks to membership fees that tend to flow at the same pace despite swings in the broader retailing industry. Investors have decided to pay between 25 and 30 times that profit to own Costco's business, marking a solid premium over its less consistent retailing peers. But in situations where recent earnings are volatile or unreliable, I'm a fan of price-to-sales. There are many ways a company can swing profit over the short term, but revenue is more difficult to manipulate. Consumer-goods giant Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), for example, recently saw its P/E ratio collapse to below 17 -- a 40% decline in the past year. That's mostly thanks to a one-time, $9 billion divestment of a big collection of its beauty brands. On a price-to-sales basis, P&G has become more expensive lately, with investors paying 3.9 times revenue today, compared with 3.5 times revenue a year ago. With the simple price-to-sales metric in your toolbox, an investor can quickly look behind those unusually high or low P/E numbers to get a more complete picture of a stock's valuation. An important metric and beyond Daniel Miller (debt-to-equity): When investors are looking for the next big winner in the stock market, understanding a company's financial health should be a top priority. The debt-to-equity ratio is used to measure a company's financial leverage by dividing a company's total liabilities by its stockholders' equity. And while that's a great metric that investors should acquaint themselves with, this example is going to go a step further and explain why you truly need to understand the figures you put into the equation. Here's a great example of arguably the world's most misunderstood debt figure, which unfairly inflates Ford Motor Company's (NYSE:F) debt-to-equity ratio when compared with its competitors. The reason behind the misunderstood figure is Ford Credit, which effectively acts as a bank to lend consumers financing when purchasing a vehicle, among other business objectives. Many of Ford's competitors don't have comparable financial divisions. Because Ford Credit assumes a massive debt load to fund these strategies, and isn't often separated from Ford's total debt sum, which is used in the equation, it's mostly incorrect. For context, at the end of 2016 Ford's total debt load was $142.9 billion, according to Yahoo! Finance, but its automotive debt is a modest $15.9 billion. Many investors overlook the debt situation at Ford, and let's remember that Ford Credit, which is responsible for the bulk of total debt, is actually Ford's most profitable entity outside its North America region. Debt to equity is a very important metric, but perhaps the most important thing about investing isn't about important metrics; it's about understanding what data you put into them.  Drilling down deeper often tells a different story Matt DiLallo (enterprise value-to-EBITDA):As Demitri already pointed out, a company's reported earnings can be volatile or even unreliable, which can cause a price-to-earnings ratio to become useless. The energy sector, in particular, is one where a P/E ratio often doesn't tell the correct story. That's because earnings are often artificially low because of large depreciation charges or writedowns resulting from lower commodity prices. Take pipeline giant Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI), which at first glance appears to trade at a nosebleed valuation of 86 times earnings. However, that's because the company recorded several impairment charges and other items last year, which pushed its net income down to $522 million. That's a far cry from the company's underlying earnings of $7.2 billion. And that's why I prefer to use the enterprise value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio, because it tells the whole story. Not only does it measure a company's underlying cash flow instead of its earnings, but it also compares that cash flow to a company's enterprise value, which takes debt into account. When we use this metric on Kinder Morgan, its valuation ratio falls to 15, which is right in line with other large energy infrastructure companies. Many businesses use this valuation metric to make buying or selling decisions for a unit or an asset. For example, last year Kinder Morgan sold a stake in one of its pipelines for 11.6 times EV/EBITDA to shore up its balance sheet. While that valuation was less than the 12 to 14 ratio that similar assets had fetched in the marketplace, the company sold the asset for less because it expects to earn a much higher EV/EBITDA multiple on capital invested in future system expansions with the new partner, which will more than make up the difference.  While it takes some extra work to figure out a company's EV/EBITDA ratio, that work is often worth the effort because it gives an investor a more accurate picture of a company's true value.   Daniel Miller owns shares of Ford.

Published on March 20, 2017. Most Popular Do you think there's any correlation between a less-than-robust economy and marketers' increased reliance on digital commerce and advertising? The 21st century hasn't been very cooperative so far. David Brooks, columnist for The New York Times, says the current time period is "looking much nastier and bumpier" than the 20th century. "Rising ethnic nationalism, falling faith in democracy, a dissolving world order." And, I would add, the 21st century marks the rise and absolute domination of the internet. The internet has been playing havoc with all sorts of traditional businesses, from retailing to the media. And about all we've got to show for the disruption is Amazon, Google and Facebook. And competitors find it exceedingly difficult to compete against Google and Facebook. Chuck Townsend, the retired chairman of Condé Nast, told me last year that he was "really disappointed" in the amount of digital advertising Condé Nast had generated -- a little more than 15% of ad revenues. That's why the company has teamed up with NBC Universal and Vox Media to collectively deliver 200 million web visitors, about double the Condé Nast number. What other $80 billion business doesn't know if its product is even seen or is effective in selling merchandise? What other business treats fraud as a necessary expense? And what other business is dominated by two gigantic ad platforms in Google and Facebook, with everybody else getting the crumbs? And speaking of crumbs, consumers sure don't seem to be in a buying mode. Many of the top brands are showing declines as consumers look for healthier and more innovative items. It doesn't help that many digital advertisers seem to be conceding that their products will interest only consumers who are already sold on them. So brand building is taking a backseat, and marketers are pumping more and more of their money into digital ads, focusing intently on their most avid buyers by following their every move around the internet. Casual or indifferent buyers are ignored. Procter & Gamble, for one, has come to the conclusion that it is missing out on building its brands by not stretching for a broader reach. P&G's focus is now on "reach and continuity," said Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard, with brands such as Tide, Pampers and Febreze increasing reach 10% to 20% in the U.S. while still focusing on their most important consumer segments. That effort has included "shifting to more broadly appealing television shows and also higher–reach digital platforms," Ad Age reported. P&G is also scaling back on targeted Facebook advertising because it wasn't helping it reach enough new customers. Maybe Facebook should start a new service going beyond "likes" and catering to the much broader segment of "take it or leave its" or even the more lackadaisical "so whats?" The point is marketers, to grow in a non-growth environment, need to become more aggressive in building their brands by reaching out to once-in-a-while churchgoers rather than preaching to the choir over and over again. Kraft Heinz, meanwhile, is not simply making small adjustments. The company, the product of a 2015 merger, is a proponent of the slash-and-burn style of management. As The Wall Street Journal said, the company "is motivated by an inexorable logic. There is little growth in consumer products, so the model appears to be: buy, cut costs and buy again. Kraft Heinz believes it needs a big new target. It will likely prove a determined hunter." You would think that this approach, which encompasses zero-based budgeting, would prove devastating to ad spending, but at Kraft Heinz they seem to be cutting so they'll have more money for advertising. A year ago, the company said it would increase "working media" by $50 million and cut back on "nonworking" media such as production (as P&G has done). What's actually happened in the last year is surprising -- at least to me. I asked our crack Ad Age Datacenter crew -- Kevin Brown and Brad Johnson -- along with reporter Jessica Wohl, to look into what Kraft Heinz actually spent on advertising during 2016, fully expecting that it couldn't resist chopping ads to bolster the bottom line. But here's what they found: Kraft Heinz "appears to have met -- and exceeded" its plan to increase its U.S. working media budget by $50 million in 2016, Brad told me. He said the company's measured media spending rose by $92 million, or 19.2%, in the first 11 months of 2016 versus the same period in 2015, according to our analysis of data from Kantar Media. Since Kraft Heinz is fixated on increasing its operating margins, you've got to figure that its increased ad spending paid off by selling more high-margin products (unless it got the extra money by drastically lowering its production costs -- maybe it shot its TV commercials on an iPhone). In addition to a big Heinz "Meet the Ketchups" Super Bowl campaign, the company spent money on cleaner formulations of well-known products, such as Capri Sun Organic and Kraft macaroni and cheese with no artificial flavors, preservatives or synthetic colors. In 2017, the company said it would focus on three key brands -- Heinz, Kraft and Planters -- and on five categories with global potential: condiments and sauces, cheese, meals, nuts and baby food -- with plans for "significant incremental investment in marketing." It would have been very interesting to observe how the Kraft Heinz-Unilever amalgamation would have panned out. Last year, Unilever reduced its "brand marketing investment" as a percentage of sales, enabling the company to improve its operating margin. Maybe Kraft Heinz can show the Unilever people how they can have higher margins and still spend more money on advertising, and why I'm guessing Kraft Heinz will continue to be a "determined hunter" of Unilever and why P&G will also be paying close attention.

Read more about the partnership here. Answer from Aaron Yip, software engineer: With the turn of the 1900s, Germany was perfectly poised to become the greatest superpower in written history, one of the most industrialized nations at the time (next to UK and Argentina) paired with the biggest military for the following 50 years. Trending: Pep Guardiola’s Bizarre Claim After Liverpool Draw The German empire and territories would soon give birth to an overwhelming portion of future Nobel Laureates and many of the greatest minds of the 20th century including Max Born, Hans Bethe, Alexander Grothendieck, Bernard Katz, Henry Kissinger, Madeleine Albright, Walter Kohn, Hans Adolf Krebs, Charles Proteus Steinmetz, and Albert Einstein. All of these people would be forced to flee the German empire. Where did they go? Well… The United States is universally renowned for its universities and industry giants today like Apple, Google, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, Dropbox and Uber; as well as Sun Microsystems, Intel, Yahoo!, IBM all the way to Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, AT&T, Goldman Sachs, eBay, United States Steel, Ford, and General Electric. Albert Einstein, fleeing Germany, would find refuge at Princeton and change the world forever in many ways. On the eve of World War II, he penned a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt which would establish the Manhattan Project. There, future Nobel Laureates Hans Bethe and Enrico Fermi, refugees from Italy, ran the labs that invented the atomic bomb to end WW2 for the United States.

Reuters Nobel Laureates With Immigrant Roots Abdul Fattah Jandali is a political migrant from Homs, a city now destroyed by the Syrian civil war. Jandali started university at the American University of Beirut, but protests ultimately forced him to flee Lebanon. He finished his degree at Colombia University in the U.S. and continued with an economics PhD at Wisconsin University. There he met and dated Joanne Carol Schieble, a German-Swiss Catholic. She became pregnant, and they placed their child for adoption in San Francisco. The couple that adopted their baby named him Steve Jobs.

Reuters Most popular: Poll: Half of Canadians Want Asylum Seekers Who Illegally Cross U.S. Border Deported South African Elon Musk builds on the Martian dream with his work at SpaceX. In his biography, answering why he choose to move to the U.S., Musk says, "The United States is definitely ahead in culture of innovation. If someone wants to accomplish great things, there is no better place than the U.S.” This is absolutely correct. But let us imagine a slightly different world. A world where Maryam Mirzakhani and Pardis Sabeti are Canadian Professors; where Apple and Google are Canadian companies; where Carnegie Mellon University and the Industrial Revolution were founded in Canada; and so were YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, Dropbox, Uber, Sun Microsystems, Intel, Yahoo!, IBM, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, AT&T, Goldman Sachs, eBay, Boeing, Citigroup, Kroger, Costco, Home Depot, Walgreen, State Farm Insurance, Lockheed Martin, Walt Disney, Oracle, Amazon, McDonalds, and innumerable other companies. Imagine Satya Nadella, Sundar Pichai, and Vinod Khosla running Canadian internet giants. For our entire history, our country has been defined by welcoming when other nations oppressed. The most American thing is unconditional love — love that ended wars; love that helped build everything from YouTube and Instagram to McDonalds and Disney; love that uncovered new laws of physics, advanced the frontiers of space, and saved countless millions of lives on earth. The most American thing ever is exclaiming boldly and unyieldingly, "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free; the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me.” Those were the greatest minds of the last century who came and helped transform America into the global center of innovation from technology and politics to sciences and the arts.

The German empire and territories would soon give birth to an overwhelming portion of future Nobel Laureates and many of the greatest minds of the 20th century including Max Born, Hans Bethe, Alexander Grothendieck, Bernard Katz, Henry Kissinger, Madeleine Albright, Walter Kohn, Hans Adolf Krebs, Charles Proteus Steinmetz, and Albert Einstein. All of these people would be forced to flee the German empire. Where did they go? Well… The United States is universally renowned for its universities and industry giants today like Apple, Google, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, Dropbox and Uber; as well as Sun Microsystems, Intel, Yahoo!, IBM all the way to Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, AT&T, Goldman Sachs, eBay, United States Steel, Ford, and General Electric. Albert Einstein, fleeing Germany, would find refuge at Princeton and change the world forever in many ways. On the eve of World War II, he penned a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt which would establish the Manhattan Project. There, future Nobel Laureates Hans Bethe and Enrico Fermi, refugees from Italy, ran the labs that invented the atomic bomb to end WW2 for the United States.

A survey of 102 companies, including Nestle SA and Procter & Gamble Co., found that 180,000 products were reformulated in 2016, according to a report from the Consumer Goods Forum. That was about double the previous year. “The big consumer companies are responding to competitive pressures,” Peter Freedman, managing director of the industry body, said by phone. “The growth in the industry is coming from small startups with product portfolios that have a healthier angle.” The biggest producers are losing share to smaller, localized brands that are capitalizing on shoppers’ growing preference for healthier and more sustainable products. Organic growth for global consumer companies has fallen to less than 3 percent for the last three years, according to Credit Suisse analysts. Adding to changing consumer tastes, governments are clamping down on unhealthy products. In March, the U.K. followed Mexico in imposing a tax on sugary drinks in an effort to cut obesity. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last year announced companies would be required to label products with more detailed information about their sugar content. After failing to meet internal goals, Nestle says it has found a way to reduce sugar in chocolate by as much as 40 percent and will cut the amount of sugar in the chocolate and confectionery it sells in the U.K. and Ireland by 10 percent by next year. Mars said 99 percent of its products now contain less than 250 calories per serving. “The forces of the market are pushing things in the right direction, and there will be more to come,” Freedman said. “Products will have less salt, less sugar and fewer calories.” Tags Consumer Goods Commerce Economics Salt Shopper Product Sugar Maker Consumer Portfolio Recommended for you Race photos Click here for photos Follow Live Well Nebraska More events Health and fitness events Mar 23 Breathe and Brew Spring Yoga Series Thu, Mar 23, 2017 @ 6:30 pm Lucky Bucket Brewery Mar 28 Simple Fix Freezer Meal Preparation Workshop Tue, Mar 28, 2017 @ 5:30 pm Hy-Vee Mar 29 Adult Alcohol & Drug Evaluations Wed, Mar 29, 2017 @ 9:00 am Serenity Matters Counseling Mar 30 Who Leads, Who Follows: Feeding and Physical Activity Division of Responsibility in Childcare Thu, Mar 30, 2017 @ 6:30 pm ISU Extension and Outreach, West Pottawattamie Mar 31 DBS Therapy: A Seminar Focusing On A Therapy For The Movement Symptoms of Essential Tremor Fri, Mar 31, 2017 @ 1:00 pm Scott Conference Center Live Well Nebraska Magazine 'It's never too late to get started': Omaha woman becomes professional bodybuilder at 46 “I wouldn’t say I’m obsessive about anything.

Similarly, when it comes to video, marketers need a screen, creative, eyeballs and accurate measurement to track performance. Since the debut of the television, the medium of video has cast a spell that works wonders for marketing. Today, it remains the content format du jour for advertisers and marketers of all shades, and encompasses TV ads, VoD, OOH display, and numerous forms of online content. It spans multiple marketing disciplines and environments, and expertise is claimed by everyone from creative agencies to analytics firms. While the format seemingly finds its way into every area of marketing, we still don't necessarily have clear definitions of what video marketing encompasses and who should 'own' video - or if we even need this clarity. One thing is sure though: Brands are eating up all forms of video. This is hardly surprising, given the vast proportion of internet traffic that it accounts for. Last year, Cisco predicted that video would represent 82% of all internet traffic by 2020. Whether it's pre-roll, in-stream, auto-play, skippable, viewable or cost per completed view, an ad that moves seems to be more desired - and has more cut-through - than a static ad. A third of today's UK and US digital video viewers already watch more than 4 hours of digital video every week. But the consumption route is changing, as more consumers become 'mobile-first'. At this year's Ad Week Europe conference, I'm particularly looking forward to seeing how video fits into the mobile strategies discussed. Will all of the brands be using mobile video, and - more importantly - should they? Which video marketing strategies will be mobile-first? And what changes and innovations can we expect in this space in terms of creative, delivery, and measurement? While the pace of change accelerates, the most prominent challenge will continue to be the rapid shift of video consumption to mobile. Despite this clear trend, many marketers are still repurposing landscape, TV-style content for mobile ads. Rather than creating mobile-first content, they're simply recycling existing video or trying to squeeze TV and web content into a mobile environment. As an industry, we need to re-think mobile creative. It must be short, punchy, and engaging. The brand needs to appear as soon as possible in the video, particularly for skippable ads, in order to register a brand impression. In broad terms, we need to change the mindset from that of creating video for the 'digital world' in general, and think specifically of creating video content for mobile consumers. Discussion of impressions also reminds us that digital marketing campaigns live and die by targeting and measurement, and video is no exception. Digital videos are a form of performance marketing, and their success is judged in a binary, quantifiable way. Was the ad seen? How long for? Was it the right kind of viewer? Was there a click-through? How many shares? These are the metrics that dominate the plans and reports of digital marketers. But one trend I'm seeing emerge is the growth of digital campaigns as branding exercises. Rather than a hyper-targeted approach, some brands are beginning to see their digital campaigns as 'brand broadcasts'. In line with this, just a few months ago Procter & Gamble's chief brand officer, Mark Pritchard, announced that the company was diverting spend away from much of its targeted digital marketing, and turning back towards broad reach. No other media is measured in the same way as digital campaigns. Print ads and billboards may well lead to sales, but these can't be quantified. Having stuck rigorously to the idea of hyper-targeting and inflexible metrics, it seems that digital marketers may now be more willing to accept that certain ads are 'brand ads' rather than simply a hard driver of sales leads. The best magicians stay ahead of their peers, always coming up with new ways to amaze. Similarly, marketers must constantly find ways to keep their audiences impressed. Newer ideas, like short-form and interactive, encouraged marketers to be better storytellers, and they continue to do so. Meanwhile, advanced measurement tools help marketers better track performance and success, however the brand defines it. Video is always evolving, and the best 'video magicians' don't just have the best wand or the smartest top hat. They have the right knowledge and a finger on the pulse of a format that's continuously evolving. Enjoy your Ad Week!

A new survey of 113 members of the ANA revealed that 89% viewed independent audits as a positive development. Around half (57%) saw them as very positive and one third (32%) as moderately positive; a further 8% were neutral and just 3% were moderately negative. And the advertiser body upped the ante by demanding action from seven named platforms: Amazon, Foursquare, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Snapchat and Twitter. "The ANA calls on these organizations to embrace transparency and break down their walled gardens by allowing independent audits by the MRC, " it said. Last month both Facebook and YouTube started the ball rolling when they agreed to undergo audits by the MRC. Pinterest and Twitter are understood to have discussed a similar process. Not so Snapchat, although it is open to third-party ad measurement. The platform fared badly in a recent ranking of social platforms in terms of ROI. It scored just 3.43 on a scale of 1 to 8, in part because of the difficulty marketers face in measuring key performance indicators and in targeting. The growing calls for transparency that are coming from both agencies and advertisers cannot be resisted forever. The fact that the world's largest advertiser, Procter & Gamble, has declared that it regards MRC validation as its viewability gold standard, for example, has concentrated minds. "We're accepting a shared level of error in order to conduct business on a level playing field across platforms and publishers," P&G's chief brand officer said recently. "But we expect all of our agencies, media suppliers, and platforms to adopt the standard during 2017 … We will no longer tolerate the ridiculous complexity of different viewability standards." An particular frustration for marketers, according to Bill Duggan, exec VP, ANA, is that "they are unable to optimize if walled gardens don't open up and share data".

(Brett Le Blanc/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @bleblancphoto BIRD-WATCHING TOOLS Binoculars or camera Binoculars are the go-to tool of most bird watchers, including nearly all those on Saturday's early-morning walk. Some use cameras with long-range lenses. Spotting scope Doug Chang, the guide for the Wetland Park walk, uses a Swarovski spotting scope to focus in on birds out in the field. Traditionally used for hunting, the spotting scope sits on a tripod and has a powerful lens allowing viewers to see birds in greater detail than by using binoculars. Bird-watching guide or app Chang uses the "Sibley Birds West: Field Guide to Birds of Western North America," but he recommends any guide published by the Audobon Society or National Geographic. He also uses the book's auxiliary smartphone app, which allows him to hear the bird's call. By BROOKE WANSER LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL Just after sunrise Saturday, bird enthusiasts gathered to celebrate International Migratory Bird Day by wandering through Clark County Wetlands Park, hoping to catch a glimpse of birds passing through. Crystal Alura Jackson, a program specialist at the park, said around 600 schools, parks, zoos and museums in the Americas create events to celebrate the day, which is the main program of Environment for the Americas. This year’s theme was “Stopover Sites: Helping Birds Along the Way.” “For Southern Nevada that’s quite important,” Jackson said.“Water is scarce here, so it’s important to have a habitat for migratory birds that keep going and for those that rest here and nest.” Wetlands Park is a major stopover site for hundreds of species of birds traveling the north-south Pacific Flyway that extends from Alaska to Patagonia, organizers said. Jackson said the approximately 30 people participating in the morning’s two-hour walk through the nature preserve were likely to be “die-hard enthusiasts.” Birds trilled in the cool morning air as David Walker shot a photo of a black phoebe. Walker, whose wife Jody works at the Wetlands Park, became interested in bird watching through her work about two years ago. “For me, it’s more about photography,” said Walker, who posts wildlife photos on his blog, naturallyvegas.com. The hobby began when his wife gave him a book, which is a bucket list of birds. “My goal is to take a good picture of a male and a female,” Walker said. The group’s largest bird sighting was just above the preserve’s Big Bridge as guide Doug Chang pointed out cinnamon teal and blue-winged teal ducks and a great-tailed grackle. Chang, who is president of the Red Rock Audubon Society, said he became involved in wildlife after retiring from Proctor & Gamble and moving to Las Vegas five years ago. “Bird-watching is just something that requires some studying, and for people to get out in nature,” Chang said. “Both of those are things that I like to do.” He’s taken many trips and read many books and articles about birds, but he said the bulk of his knowledge has come from being wrong. “You go out and say, ‘Oh, that’s a duck!’ And it’s really not a duck, and somebody corrects you,” Chang said, laughing.

To support Ad Age and the industry we cover please either: SUBSCRIBE or WHITELIST US ANA Aims to Standardize Gender Equality in Ads By Jack Neff. Published on March 20, 2017. In a bid to strengthen its #SeeHer gender-equality push, the Association of National Advertisers is making the ad-scoring system behind it available for any copy-testing service, meaning it could become a standard module in the software engines by which analytically inclined marketers evaluate ads. At the same time, the ANA's Alliance for Family Entertainment has completed testing the 200 most-watched TV shows using its Gender Equality Measure, with an eye toward providing those ratings to advertisers that want to align their gender-conscious ads with like-minded TV buys. "The reason we're testing both advertising and media is that context matters," said Shelley Zalis, a co-developer of #SeeHer, founder and CEO of the Girls' Lounge and former CEO of research firm OTX. TOP 10 GEM ADS TV Ranking (GEM) of 30-second ads, March 4-10 1 Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion (113) Johnson & Johnson 2 Swiffer (112) Procter & Gamble 3 Brow Stylist Definer (109) L'Oreal Paris Coca-Cola (109) Coca-Cola 5 Amazon Echo Dot (108) Amazon Geico Auto Insurance (108) Geico McDonald's Happy Meal (108) McDonald's 8 Amazon Echo Dot (107) Amazon 9 Egg McMuffin with Canadian Bacon (106) McDonald's Garnier Whole Blends Hair Products (106) Garnier Source: Alliance for Family Entertainment/ABX The Gender Equality Measure scores ads or entertainment on how prominently they depict women, amid a larger industry conversation about gender equality in both ads and the business itself. It might seem unusual for competing copy-testing services to adopt a common methodology like the protocol behind GEM scores, but Ms. Zalis said copy testers tend to measure the same basic things, such as effects on purchase intent or likability, even if they get their scores in different ways or call them different things. "One thing that's very important for us is to measure what matters," Ms. Zalis said. "One of the biggest problems we've had in our industry is that we don't have accountability to measure progress." GEM already has been run on more than 17,000 ads, creating a "robust database," said Stephen Quinn, the former Walmart chief marketing officer who chairs the Alliance for Family Entertainment. While the ANA isn't generally releasing the results publicly, both camps are privately asking for diagnostics to help improve their scores, said Mr. Quinn, who will be meeting with media companies on the subject this week. Since those GEM scores could ultimately find their way into standards or software that govern media buys, the stakes for media are potentially huge. The Alliance for Family Entertainment also has developed GEM "bootcamps" to help advertisers understand and improve their gender-equality scores. Georgia-Pacific, marketer of such brands as Brawny and Quilted Northern, has fared well with GEM but was still the first company to participate in a bootcamp. The top 10 ads by GEM score from the week of March 4 show that there's no set formula. They include an ad from Procter & Gamble's Swiffer showing a little boy cutting the hair of his stuffed animals and sister, and mom cleaning up. Another two are conventional beauty ads from L'Oréal USA for L'Oréal Paris and Garnier. Amazon's Echo Dot fared well with two ads on the list featuring household vignettes with men and women. Coca-Cola made it with an ad featuring mostly male race car drivers plus Danica Patrick, while Geico appeared with arguably one of its least funny ads in years—albeit one with a man and woman getting equal face time.
