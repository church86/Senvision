Each rubber-stamped image was allocated SR20 by the three Saudi firms, and the proceeds, totaling SR50,000 were then donated to Al Ehsan Human Care Charity Association. “We’ve been overwhelmed by the reaction of our consumers and how they’ve taken to this Guinness World Record attempt. We’d like to thank everyone who took part and who made it possible for us to say thank you to our public employees on today’s Saudi National Day,” said Hossam Chehab, National Sales Director. He added: “Saudi National Day is a special occasion for us all to remember our country’s development with pride and joy. For our consumers, it’s an important date in the calendar, and we wanted to design an activity that would engage our shoppers and which would give them an opportunity to get involved.” The new Guinness World Record was set by Saudi shoppers using rubber stamps to create a mosaic image of the Kingdom. The campaign, which was live for a period of three days in the run up the then 86th Saudi National Day celebration, was a tribute to the Kingdom’s public employees and their service in support of the country and its people. Talal Omar, MENA country manager at Guinness World Records, said: “Breaking a Guinness World Record is no mean feat; an attempt must fulfill key criteria before it will even be considered – it must be measurable, breakable, verifiable and standardizable, among others. These criteria were met, and Saudi consumers created the image with the highest number of individually-stamped contributions globally. We would like to extend our congratulations to them.” — SG TAGS Panda Retail Company SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleTo fight deadly stigma, Kenya turns to albino beauty pageant Next articleNatcom stuns Nestle Milo Sadiq Hussain RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Panda unveils digital action to promote healthy lifestyle Panda distributes free shopping vouchers to hospitalized children Panda holds employee Iftar NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply November 2016 S M T W T F S « Oct       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30   STAY CONNECTED 1,489,252FansLike 41,132FollowersFollow Ads Recent Posts SR16b dirty money: 15 under probe Nov 20, 2016 48-hour coalition truce in Yemen takes effect Nov 20, 2016 Traffic disrupted as pedestrian bridge collapses in Jeddah Nov 20, 2016 Some public buildings found violating law on hoisting national flag Nov 20, 2016 Ministry comes to the rescue of abused woman Nov 20, 2016 Archives November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 © Saudi Gazette 2015 All rights reserved.

Published on October 21, 2016. Most Popular Procter & Gamble Co. Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard took over as chairman of the Association of National Advertisers officially on Friday, outlining his priorities at the group's Masters of Marketing conference in Orlando. McDonald's CMO Deborah Wahl takes over for Mr. Pritchard as vice chair, putting her in line to likely chair the group starting in 2018. And the ANA elected a slate of new and returning board members, with the new group including Maryam Banikarim, global CMO of Hyatt Corp.; Suzy Deering, CMO-North America of eBay; Melisa Goldie, CMO of Calvin Klein; Maggie Chan Jones, CMO of SAP; Denise Karkos, CMO, TD Ameritrade; and Karen Walker, CMO of Cisco Systems. In a video interview with Advertising Age, Mr. Pritchard outlines his priorities for the ANA. And he looks at why "less is more" when it comes to content for P&G and for advertisers broadly. ~ ~ ~ CORRECTION: An earlier version of the story incorrectly listed Melisa Goldie as CMO of SAP. She is CMO of Calvin Klein. Another new board member, Maggie Chan Jones, CMO of SAP, was omitted.

Marc Pritchard, Global Brand Officer at Procter & Gamble, discussed this subject at the Association of National Advertisers' (ANA) 2016 Masters of Marketing Conference. And he suggested that the manufacturer of Tide detergent, Pampers diapers and Crest toothpaste – and, indeed, the world's biggest advertiser – is currently forced to expend too much energy on issues surrounding metrics. "Frankly, our patience has run out. It's time to insist that all media partners adopt common, transparent measurement standards and accept third-party verification," said Pritchard. (For more details, read Warc's exclusive report: P&G seeks to end the measurement debate – for the sake of creativity.) Expanding on this argument, he suggested that the outsized effort required to address measurement reduces the time available to generate breakthrough creative. "Beautiful craft requires time. And we have a problem, because we're spending too much of our time on [the] measurement of advertising versus the quality," Pritchard said. The need to move on from insular debates about metrics, and instead focus on delivering ads worthy of consumer attention, is brought into stark relief by several trends observable in the digital ecosystem. Examples of these shifts include the surging popularity of ad-blocking software, as well as the habit of fast-forwarding through TV commercials and skipping pre-roll messages whenever possible. "We're fiddling with measurement debates while consumers are blocking our ads. Measurement is not going to make crappy advertising better," Pritchard reported. "We need to stop wasting time on measurement transactions, and invest in what's really important, which is elevating the craft of our work." And focusing on craft, he continued, can help marketers foster much deeper relationships with consumers. "The consumers that we serve deserve our very best, and it is the key to unlocking growth."

Published on October 21, 2016. Most Popular Tony Pace's two-year reign as chairman of the Association of National Advertisers ended this week when Procter & Gamble Co. Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard took over the lead role. Ad Age caught up with Mr. Pace at the ANA's Masters of Marketing conference in Orlando this week to get his perspective on his two-year term, during which the ANA drew headlines for taking on media rebates and other transparency issues in media buying and selling. "I think we made some real good progress there but I think there is a lot more to be done" on transparency, he said. With the issue consuming much of the ANA's attention, Mr. Pace said he regrets not being able to spend more time addressing the industry's training and development issues. Closing the talent gap is among the priorities of the ANA's CMO-led "Masters Circle" leadership alliance program that was announced in Orlando. That includes working with the ANA's educational foundation and other organizations to "ensure that university students are encouraged to consider careers in advertising and marketing," according to priorities outlined this week. Mr. Pace -- the former Subway CMO who now runs a consultancy called Cerebral Graffiti -- addressed the transparency issue and more in a video interview: In this article: Agencies Regulation Special Report: ANA Annual Meeting 2016 Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2016 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17 x Scroll to Continue

The in-depth report, underwritten by Eyeview, surveyed more than 200 senior brand marketers, including interviews with leaders from P&G, Honda, Clorox and Bank of America, highlights how brands can harness the power of video to reach consumers and influence their in-store buying decisions. The study’s most noteworthy findings indicate that to demonstrate real ROI from video marketing campaigns, brands must embrace a one-to-one model instead of one-to-many. With this approach, brands stand not only to gain foot-traffic into their stores and drive sales, but they are able to demonstrate ROI directly from their video campaigns. “When it comes to digital video advertising, marketers have traditionally relied on the medium to deliver branding objectives with less of a focus on sales goals. However, the following research reveals that digital video is at its inflection point of the adoption curve, moving from a branding to a sales tool,” said Jim Spaeth, former President of The Advertising Research Foundation (ARF) and co-author of the study (pictured top left). “Digital video has strong financial returns and unique capabilities to drive sales while still building brands. Indications are that this medium is poised and ready to mature in the next 1-2 years.” Through in-depth interviews with marketers from today’s leading auto, CPG, retail and travel brands, the report highlights the efforts companies are making to embrace this vision, wins they have recorded as a result and what hurdles continue to hold them back. According to the study, 65 percent of marketers say that digital video is growing in importance for driving offline sales. However, that near-future view contrasts with the current state, where a smaller 42 percent of advertisers see digital video as superior to other leading media. Marketers today are more likely to view digital video as a branding tool with more than half seeing it as superior for building brand awareness and favorability, telling their brand’s story and connecting with consumers emotionally. “The future of marketing is about business outcomes, not media outputs. Marketers now can deliver on the long-awaited promise of marrying the engagement and appeal of television-quality video advertising with data and targeting capabilities in order to drive sales,” said Oren Harnevo, CEO and Co-founder, Eyeview. “Where before marketers always had to choose between promoting the brand or making a sale, today, video can do more than branding and drive significant incremental offline sales for clients across all screens, television, desktop, mobile and social.” Additional key findings from the report include: Marketers’ Perceptions of Digital Video Are Shifting. The study revealed a disconnect between marketers’ perceptions and their experience with digital video — 87 percent reported enjoying positive ROIs with the medium. Evidence Shows Strong Potential for Digital Video to Drive ROI. A substantial proportion of marketers, 40 percent, already see digital video as a sales driver while 28 percent of marketers recognize it to be both a superior branding medium and a superior sales driver. Will video be the next performance-driven, marketing category? Marketing categories like search and retargeting have been held to a higher standard of accountability with sales and ROI as the main measures of campaign success. Evidence shows strong potential for digital video to drive ROI as 65 percent of marketers agree that video can be personalized like search and display. Fifty-six percent see that video fits with the current emphasis on data, targeting, efficiency and programmatic. Fifty-four percent believe it’s easy to track and prove digital video’s impact. The Death of TV Advertising or TV Advertising Reinvented? Return on ad spend (ROAS) or sales lift per dollar will surpass traditional branding in importance as a measure of digital video success within the next one to two years. This shift from measuring success by media outputs like impressions and CPMs to business outcomes such as sales will drive a major step change with how marketers plan, activate and determine traditional linear TV and video success.

PEAK SEASON: K Street is drafting contingency plans to address all potential outcomes of the election, Catherine Ho reports for The Washington Post. “The period from November to March around a presidential transition is probably the busiest time for lobby and public affairs firms,” said Stewart Verdery of Monument Policy Group. “Trying to figure out how to engage a new administration, who the appointments are, changes with [congressional committee] chairmen. That’s a huge amount of work for clients. At least 60 percent of business development work is done in the next couple months.” Key issues to the business community include immigration, tax reform and infrastructure spending. CHAMBEROLOGY: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is expected to announce changes in its leadership structure with the impending departure of Bruce Josten, who will retire at the end of the year after 22 years, The Washington Post’s Catherine Ho reports. All eyes are on president and chief executive Tom Donohue and his executive vice president and adviser Suzanne Clark. “Tom is the Chamber outside Washington, Bruce is the Chamber inside Washington,” said one Republican lobbyist. “Together they’re a phenomenal act.” The restructuring will offer clues to its future lobbying strategies and operations. “The country is moving in a more populous mood, versus a what’s-good-for-business-is-good-for-America kind of thing,” lobbyist Rick Hohlt said. TAX TASTING: Speaker Paul Ryan’s Senior Tax Counsel, George Callas, led a discussion on tax reform Wednesday at an invitation-only luncheon hosted by Steptoe & Johnson at Sonoma Restaurant & Wine Bar. On hand from Steptoe’s tax team were firm Chair Phil West, who previously served as Treasury’s international tax counsel; Lisa Zarlenga and Cameron Arterton, who served as Treasury’s tax legislative counsel and deputy legislative counsel, respectively; and Leslie Belcher, a Hill veteran and close friend ofRyan and his wife, Janna. Attendees included Dell’s Jill Shapiro, the Economic Innovation Group’s John Lettieri, Fluor Corporation’s David Marventano, NAIFA’s Judi Carsrud and Paul Dougherty, P&G’s Timothy McDonald, TD Bank’s Ron Lefrançois, and The Carlyle Group’s Shannon Stafford.

The letter, led by the National Association of Manufacturers, stressed the “urgent need to restore faith in our vital economic and government institutions and to bolster the promise of America.” To #BeTheSolution, let’s start with infrastructure, a bipartisan priority. Let’s rebuild our roads, bridges, ports, passenger rail and transit systems. Let’s invest in pipelines, railroads, tunnels and airports as well as drinking water and wastewater systems. The “Building to Win” initiative lays it all out. From transportation infrastructure to the energy infrastructure that powers our country, we can build a stronger, more inclusive economy. America is falling behind the rest of the world, but with a serious, targeted plan we can secure our economic leadership, spur real economic growth and offer more people the dignity of work.

And why have so many been so silent about it? A recent article in the Wall Street Journal reports that not one CEO at a Fortune 100 company has donated to Donald Trump's campaign, whereas one-third supported Mitt Romney in 2012. Many in business have said privately that they are terrified of a Trump administration and the possibility of trade wars and ballooning deficits, yet few CEOs vocally oppose him. So why isn't a CEO social movement taking to the barricades against a Trump presidency? One possibility: To mobilize a movement, you need a social network, and CEOs no longer have one. In other words, corporate America's "old boys' club" is dead. The question is: Is that entirely a good thing? As our research – and Trump's rise – shows, not necessarily. Building the old boys' club For most of the postwar era, American corporations were overseen by a group of elite executives and directors who all knew each other or had friends in common. In 1974, there were roughly 100 people (all male and all but one white) who each served on five or more corporate boards. Corporate America was controlled by an "old boys' club." Social network analysis shows that the board members of any two corporations were rarely more than three or four degrees of separation apart. A sneeze in one boardroom could have triggered a flu epidemic infecting more than 90 percent of the Fortune 500 within a few months. Louis Brandeis, who served on the Supreme Court from 1916 to 1939, warned about this concentration of power in his 1914 book Other People's Money: And How the Bankers Use It. To him, the network among corporate directors was an "endless chain" that served as the "most potent instrument of the Money Trust." In the 1950s, sociologist C. Wright Mills labeled this group the "power elite," interweaving business, government and the military, and subsequent researchers documented how pervasive these ties were. The heyday of corporate influence President George W. Bush's first Cabinet may have been the high-water mark of the corporate network's influence. A few highlights: Before he became vice president, Dick Cheney served on the boards of Electronic Data Systems, Procter & Gamble and Union Pacific. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had previously been CEO of GD Searle and General Instrument and served on the boards of Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Gilead Sciences and Tribune Co. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill was CEO of Alcoa and director of Eastman Kodak and Lucent Technologies. And Labor Secretary Elaine Chao was on the boards of CR Bard, Clorox, Dole, HCA Healthcare, Marine Transport, Millipore, Northwest Airlines, Protective Life and Raymond James Financial. In all, the Bush Cabinet was directly tied to 21 corporations, two degrees from another 228 and three degrees of separation from over 1,100 companies listed on Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange. No administration in history had as many direct personal contacts with corporate America. Such network ties have a tangible effect on corporate actions. Scholars found that ideas about how to run a corporation spread from board to board through shared directors, just as fads and fashions spread through contact among people. Moreover, a number of studies showed that these connections shaped how corporations and their executives engaged in politics. For example, executives at companies linked together by shared directors tended to donate to the same political candidates. At the center of this network reigned a small, linked group of powerful executives – Wharton Business School professor Michael Useem dubbed them the "inner circle" – who came to share a common viewpoint about what was best for the long-term interests of American business as a whole. Serving on many boards, particularly big bank boards (which were bigger and often filled with well-connected CEOs), gave this group an expansive view of what was best for all of business and not just particular companies and industries. As Useem's work showed, this group tended to be prominent in both business and civic life, often including corporate executives, leaders of nonprofit and cultural institutions and former government officials. Being in regular contact with each other made concerted action possible, which helped them achieve their own aims but could also have positive societal benefits, such as organizing a successful Olympics bid. It also gave the group the potential to influence government policy – for better or worse. The demise of the power elite This world of cozy, highly connected boards is now gone. The JP Morgan Chase board in 2001 had 15 directors, and all but two of them served on other boards. One director served on eight boards, including the bank itself, five held five seats each, and another five were on three or four. Today, the bank's board consists of a dozen directors, half of them retirees from prior corporate jobs. One serves on four boards, another serves on three. The rest are on just one or two. For the corporate network as a whole, by 2012, only one director sat on five major boards (compared with about 100 who sat on that many or more in 1974). So what killed the inner circle? The corporate scandals of the early 2000s and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 were the precipitating factors. As our research shows, before these events, serving on many boards was a source of prestige, and the largest corporations courted well-connected directors. But after the scandals, being a well-connected director became suspect. For example, in 2002, Forbes published an article that profiled the five directors with the most S&P 500 board seats, asserting that they were too overstretched to provide adequate oversight. In 2004, Institutional Shareholder Services, which advises large institutional investors on corporate governance, began recommending that its clients vote against directors who served on too many boards. Within a few years, the inner circle had disintegrated. From group think to kingmakers Did the demise of the inner circle stop the 1 percent from dictating policy? Well, not exactly. Each individual in the corporate elite still wields considerable influence. But as sociologist Mark Mizruchi has pointed out, they now tend to do so as individuals pursuing their own idiosyncratic agendas rather than as a group. Think Sheldon Adelson or the Koch Brothers rather than the Business Roundtable. This has not been altogether a good thing. When a single network connected corporate America, executives were forced to listen to opinions from a range of peers. And although the group skewed Republican on average, individual directors held a range of political opinions. The most well-connected leaders converged on a preference for more moderate candidates and policies and often ended up donating to both parties' candidates, not just one. The support of this group was useful, if not absolutely essential, for potential presidential candidates, and it is hard to imagine that a putative anti-establishment candidate like Trump would have passed muster. The dense web of connections allowed the inner circle to police the corporate ranks and present a unified, middle-of-the-road message to policymakers. Our own research, forthcoming in the American Journal of Sociology, finds that board ties are now too sparse to provide a means for business executives to forge common ground. CEOs today rarely serve on two or more boards, and, as a result, they no longer have monthly opportunities to hear what peers who support another point of view might think. Those board connections turned out to be a force for political moderation, and annual gatherings in Davos are not enough to replace them. American politics has arrived at a millennial inflection point. While Mills and his fellow critics lambasted the well-connected corporate inner circle for furthering their own interests over those of the majority of society, we now see that the alternative may be dysfunction and an inability to find common ground. Extremists in every corner of the political universe can gather power by targeting well-heeled funders like Adelson on the right and George Soros on the left. In this new world, compromise is frowned upon. While we don't want to return to a world where a handful of powerful white men held rule over corporate America and by extension the nation, we may benefit from building structures that operate like board ties previously did, acting as a force for compromise and moderation. To hold together, American society may require new institutions that connect a broad and diverse spectrum of business and nonprofit leaders to each other, forcing individuals to consider the views of their peers.

Gartner: Global IT Spending to Reach $3.5T Worldwide IT spending will reach $3.5 trillion in 2017, according to Gartner analysts. That's up 2.9 percent from this year's estimated spending of $3.4 trillion, according to the latest forecast.  Software spending is projected to grow 6 percent in 2016, and it will grow another 7.2 percent in 2017 to total $357 billion. IT services spending is on pace to grow 3.9 percent in 2016 to reach $597 billion, and increase 4.8 percent in 2017 to reach $943 billion.  "The immediate impact of Brexit has caused modest growth in IT spending to turn negative for 2016," John-David Lovelock, research vice president at Gartner, said. "Without the UK, global IT spending growth would have been modestly positive at 0.2 percent in 2016, but with the UK included, IT spending is expected to decrease 0.3 percent. The immediate impact of the British pound will also cause the IT spending patterns to shift as prices for IT will increase."

Admap Editor Colin Grimshaw believes this is a hot topic right now. "We think this is a big issue. Many brands, including P&G, Mars and McDonald's, having jumped in to experiment with social media, and in some cases taking money from traditional media to do this, are now re-evaluating their use of social media. "But I think there is also a broader issue around how traditional media and new media fit together in the marketing landscape," he added. This is the sixth year of the Admap Prize, sponsored by Kantar, an essay contest that encourages and rewards individual excellence in strategic thinking in brand communications. Entry is free, essays are judged by a panel of the industry's foremost thought leaders, with all awarded essays being published in Admap. The closing date for entries is January 31 2017, and there will be a prize giving event in Cannes in June. Full details are available on the Prize website. Entrants are asked to consider how TV and social media can be used solus or in combination in meeting the challenges and seizing the new opportunities in today's advertising world. Different marketing categories often require different advertising and channel strategies, so essays will need to consider a specific marketing category – FMCG, autos, retail, financial services, food, telecommunications, etc – or a more granular product/service category within a marketing category. "Watching TV transform and interact with social media and creating new possibilities will be the biggest revolution in marketing since...the birth of TV," said Marco Rimini, CEO, Central Team, Mindshare Worldwide, and one of this year's judges. "I can't wait to see what the brightest, research-based minds think about what will happen." Fellow judge Darren McColl, Chief Brand & Marketing Strategy Officer, Global for SapientNitro, commented: "As social media matures, it is clearly becoming another core marketing and content channel like TV. However, the participatory nature of social channels is redefining the landscape for content and marketing. Our expectations are changing, our behaviours are changing, our marketing must change accordingly." Any readers wanting to enter at a later date or to be reminded of the deadline can register their intention now by emailing admap.prize@warc.com and putting 'Reminder' in the subject line.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Advertise How to Build an Online Community Online Reputation Management October 22, 2016 Online Reputation Management Meg CabreraOctober 22, 2016 SEJ STAFF 670SHARES 684READS 670SHARES 684READS SEJ STAFFMeg Cabrera 670SHARES 684READS In the digital marketing world, more and more brands are now geared towards building a community. A community is a group of people engaging, sharing, and working toward a common goal. They are bound by similar interests, or thoughts. Brands like Disney and Red Bull have embraced this marketing initiative. Erica McGillivray, former senior community manager at Moz, talked about nurturing and growing a community in this recent Marketing Nerds episode. Listen to how she discussed the benefits of building a strong community around your brand, how they rolled out this strategy at Moz: Your browser does not support the audio element. Moz has successfully built its community through live events. At SEJ, we’ve also seen the importance of meeting our community through SEJ Summit, our conference series specifically designed for search marketers held year-round across the United States. The members of a brand’s community may not necessarily be product consumers. They may be a group of individuals who share a common belief, or who are followers of your brand.  These followers may become your biggest brand advocates, who can defend you in bad times, and empower your brand even more during good times. Here are a few tips on how to build your own community. Target Emotions One of the biggest advantages of building a community is allowing people to follow your brand, and they do this voluntarily. They weren’t forced, they deliberately decided to follow you. And once they do, they either love your brand or they’re upset. If they love your brand, then they’re your biggest brand ambassadors who will champion your causes. If they’re upset about your brand, welcome their insights, and hear them vent or rant about your brand. For sure, they’ll make it known in your community and will elicit good engagement between those who love you—and those who hate you. Good engagement will help your community grow. Educate Your Followers One good strategy to further build your community is to not talk about your brand. Instead, educate your followers about their need for your product, without even mentioning your brand. Procter & Gamble has a campaign called “Everyday” which offers insights and tips to the different members of their communities. The My Black is Beautiful community celebrates the collective beauty of black women. It provides fellowship amongst the members, plus it gives tips and provides education to its members. Hear Them Out Take advantage of the dialogue amongst the members of your community. Hear out their feedback, and make sure that you take action from their suggestions. Starbucks has successfully leveraged its community insights to come up with product ideas, experience ideas, merchandise materials, and community ideas in its My Starbucks Idea campaign. In Conclusion Build a dynamic community by welcoming your followers—both the good, and the not so good ones. Allow room for engagement and discussion, so you can learn from them. Educate them so they can also learn from you. Foster growth by helping them connect with others, so they can learn from each other as well.   Image Credits Featured Image: Rawpixel/DepositPhotos.com All screenshots by Meg Cabrera.

Busiest day for earnings, GDP and more coming in the next week CNBC 10/21/2016 Evelyn Cheng A flood of earnings, U.S. economic growth and some Fed speakers are set to hit markets in the coming week, and could help add confidence to a picture of moderate growth and an end to the earnings recession.  Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 110.06 +0.11 +0.10% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 760.16 +3.76 +0.50% Alphabet Inc GOOGL ▼ 775.97 -10.19 -1.30% About a third of S&P 500 (.SPX) companies are scheduled to report next week, including Apple (AAPL) on Tuesday. Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google's parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are set to post quarterly results on Thursday, the busiest day of the earnings season. "If nothing changes … we would say we came out of the earnings recession this quarter and that the second quarter was the final quarter of this earnings recession," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Financials, materials and technology are expected to show the most earnings per share growth this quarter, Stovall said, while energy industrials and telecom are forecast to be the laggards.  In the past week, financials were among the top performers after the major bank earnings topped expectations. The S&P 500 gained about 8 points for the week to end at 2,141 Friday. Next week, "I think really the big focus is going to be on earnings," said Casey Clark, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede. "I think we're in a situation where investors are focusing on earnings and traditional drivers of equity markets. Part of that is there's more comfort on global central bank policy." A UBS study in October showed that over the last five years, the S&P 500 moves more in sync with earnings per share than the level of interest rates. The correlation between stocks and earnings was very high, almost 90 percent, vs. less than 40 percent correlation between stocks and interest rates. The average year-end S&P 500 target is 2,198, according to CNBC's Market Strategist Survey conducted in October. But strategists are watching whether earnings growth will sustain further gains in the market.  "Next year's earnings look too high, and that might mean the market is a tad more expensive than it looks, but it's helpful that the third-quarter earnings [are beating so far]," said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at TIAA Global Asset Management, which has about $915 billion in assets under management. "We're still making our way out of this period where energy earnings look weak compared to where they were one year ago," Nick said. Most analysts expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates at its December meeting, but will watch data ahead of the central bank's meeting on Nov. 1 and 2. The Markit manufacturing and services PMI are scheduled for release next Monday and Wednesday, respectively. Three Fed speakers are set to speak Monday ahead of the blackout period heading into the Fed's meeting Nov. 1 and 2. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard speaks on the U.S. economy and monetary policy Monday morning, while Chicago Fed President Charles Evans is set to speak on current economic conditions and monetary policy in the afternoon. Fed Governor Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak later in the day on the future of Treasury market settlement. The first read on U.S. gross domestic product is due next Friday, and the consensus estimate from Reuters is 2.5 percent. The final read on second-quarter GDP showed an annual rate of 1.4 percent growth. A print between 1.5 percent and 3 percent is "probably a number consistent with the Fed passing in November but hiking in December," said John Canally, chief economic strategist at LPL Financial. Other data scheduled for release next week include the Markit manufacturing and services PMI, the employment cost index, consumer sentiment and pending home sales. Overseas, the preliminary estimate on third-quarter U.K. GDP is due for release Thursday, the first full-quarter GDP data since the surprise U.K. vote to leave the European Union.

Published on October 21, 2016. Most Popular As chief marketing officer of Koch Industries' Georgia-Pacific Corp., Douwe Bergsma has brought on Droga5, Deutsch, Cutwater, the Martin Agency and most recently VaynerMedia to rework the marketing across eight brands. But along with that, he's taught his entire marketing department about storytelling with the help of Character LLC in a process that includes improv training. In a talk to the Association of National Advertisers Masters of Marketing Conference in Orlando on Friday, Mr. Bergsma said that's helped his brands grow sales and share despite not boosting spending -- and getting outspent by the likes of Procter & Gamble Co. and Kimberly-Clark Corp. Among other things, his marketers have learned that good stories frequently involve conflict – something that the brand has worked into the narrative around Brawny's "Stay Giant" campaign from Cutwater, which is about personifying the brand's inner contradiction about being both tough and gentle. In a video interview with Advertising Age, Mr. Bergsma talked about why storytelling training is important for marketers, and how the approach has played out for Brawny.

About a third of S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report next week, including Apple on Tuesday. Amazon.com and Google's parent Alphabet are set to post quarterly results on Thursday, the busiest day of the earnings season. "If nothing changes … we would say we came out of the earnings recession this quarter and that the second quarter was the final quarter of this earnings recession," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Financials, materials and technology are expected to show the most earnings per share growth this quarter, Stovall said, while energy industrials and telecom are forecast to be the laggards. In the past week, financials were among the top performers after the major bank earnings topped expectations. The S&P 500 gained about 8 points for the week to end at 2,141 Friday. Next week, "I think really the big focus is going to be on earnings," said Casey Clark, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede. "I think we're in a situation where investors are focusing on earnings and traditional drivers of equity markets. Part of that is there's more comfort on global central bank policy." A UBS study in October showed that over the last five years, the S&P 500 moves more in sync with earnings per share than the level of interest rates. The correlation between stocks and earnings was very high, almost 90 percent, vs. less than 40 percent correlation between stocks and interest rates. Correlation of S&P 500 vs. interest rates and EPS, last five years, in % Source: UBS, as of October 20, 2016. The average year-end S&P 500 target is 2,198, according to CNBC's Market Strategist Survey conducted in October. But strategists are watching whether earnings growth will sustain further gains in the market. "Next year's earnings look too high, and that might mean the market is a tad more expensive than it looks, but it's helpful that the third-quarter earnings [are beating so far]," said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at TIAA Global Asset Management, which has about $915 billion in assets under management. "We're still making our way out of this period where energy earnings look weak compared to where they were one year ago," Nick said. Most analysts expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates at its December meeting, but will watch data ahead of the central bank's meeting on Nov. 1 and 2. The Markit manufacturing and services PMI are scheduled for release next Monday and Wednesday, respectively. Three Fed speakers are set to speak Monday ahead of the blackout period heading into the Fed's meeting Nov. 1 and 2. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard speaks on the U.S. economy and monetary policy Monday morning, while Chicago Fed President Charles Evans is set to speak on current economic conditions and monetary policy in the afternoon. Fed Governor Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak later in the day on the future of Treasury market settlement. The first read on U.S. gross domestic product is due next Friday, and the consensus estimate from Reuters is 2.5 percent. The final read on second-quarter GDP showed an annual rate of 1.4 percent growth. A print between 1.5 percent and 3 percent is "probably a number consistent with the Fed passing in November but hiking in December," said John Canally, chief economic strategist at LPL Financial. Other data scheduled for release next week include the Markit manufacturing and services PMI, the employment cost index, consumer sentiment and pending home sales. Overseas, the preliminary estimate on third-quarter U.K. GDP is due for release Thursday, the first full-quarter GDP data since the surprise U.K. vote to leave the European Union. "Brexit negotiations [are] always on slow boil every week and next week is no different," Canally said. "A very weak number on the U.K.[GDP] may weaken Prime Minister May's hand temporarily."

Credit: Target More like this Apple commits to run off 100% renewable energy Apple’s $850M solar plant rockets it to first place among U.S. corporations Rooftop solar installation prices drop as does payback time Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles Target has surpassed perennial champion Walmart as the U.S.'s top corporate user of solar power, according to a new report. Target has installed 147 megawatts (million watts or MW) of solar capacity on 300 stores, according to the 2016 Solar Means Business Report from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). "We're incredibly proud of the progress we've made in improving building efficiencies and reducing environmental impact. Our commitment to installing solar panels on 500 stores and distribution centers by 2020 is evidence of that progress," John Leisen, vice president of property management at Target, said in the SEIA statement. Walmart had held the top spot for the previous four years and still claims second place with 145MW of solar power installed on 364 buildings, according to the SEIA, which has been tracking corporate solar deployments for the past five years. This year, real estate developer Prologis came in third with 107.8MW of solar. Apple, which is in fourth place with 93.9MW of installed solar power, is a likely contender for first place sometime next year. Last year, Apple announced it was investing $850 million in a solar power plant through a partnership with First Solar, one of the nation's largest photovoltaic (PV) manufacturers and provider of utility-scale PV plants. Through a 25-year purchasing agreement, Apple will get 130MW from the new California Flats Solar Project. The project is currently under construction and is expected to be completed by the end of this year. Other Top 10 companies recognized in the SEIA's report include Costco (50.7 MW), Kohl's (50.2 MW), IKEA (44 MW), Macy's (38.9 MW), General Growth Properties (30.2 MW) and Hartz Mountain Industries (22.7 MW). While IKEA is in seventh place, it powers 91% of its retail locations through solar, according to the SEIA. Overall, U.S. corporations have doubled their solar installations year over year and are expected to close out 2016 with nearly 280MW of solar power -- compared to 130MW in 2015. The SEIA's report covers corporate solar installations in 38 states plus Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico; it tracks almost 1,100MW of solar installations at 2,000 U.S. companies. "To put that in context, that's enough electricity to power the equivalent of 193,000 homes every year," the report stated. "Also noteworthy, in just the first three quarters of 2016, the report found 142MW of corporate solar was added in the U.S., more than was installed in all of 2015 (129 MW)." In 2014, frustrated by a lack of renewable energy and a purchasing system that's too complicated, major U.S. companies joined an initiative to force the government and utilities to change. Along with the World Wildlife Fund and the World Resources Institute, the corporations signed a pact supporting six principles to clearly identify what's needed when purchasing renewable energy. The initial companies included Bloomberg, Facebook, General Motors, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Johnson & Johnson, Mars, Novelis, Procter and Gamble, REI, Sprint and Walmart. The companies called for six specific changes they wanted the energy industry to adopt to increase renewable energy use: Greater choice in procurement options More access to cost competitive options Longer- and variable-term contracts Access to new projects that reduce emissions Streamlined third-party financing Increased purchasing options with utilities "Solar plays a vital role within our renewable energy portfolio," Mark Vanderhelm, vice president of energy for Walmart, said in a statement. "This is evident by our 2020 commitment of doubling solar energy projects at our Walmart stores, Sam's Clubs and distribution centers across the nation. Our focus is on finding those solar projects that are right for the business."

We are here providing food, shelter, relief supplies and other support to help thousands of people whose lives have been upended by this storm,” said Brad Kieserman, Red Cross vice president, Disaster Operations and Logistics. “We’re in the middle of a vast response, and our work is far from over. The Red Cross will be here as long as people need our help.” MAKE A DONATION The massive Red Cross relief effort in response to Hurricane Matthew in the U.S. could cost between $24 – $28 million as volunteers continue to help in the weeks ahead while residents recover from the devastation – yet, the Red Cross has raised only $8.1 million in designated donations and pledges for the response to Matthew thus far. The Red Cross depends on donations to provide immediate relief. Help people affected by Hurricane Matthew by visiting redcross.org, calling 1-800-RED CROSS, or texting the word MATTHEW to 90999 to make a $10 donation. Donations enable the Red Cross to prepare for, respond to and help people recover from this disaster. The Red Cross depends on donations to provide immediate relief. Help people affected by Hurricane Matthew by visiting redcross.org, calling 1-800-RED CROSS, or texting the word MATTHEW to 90999 to make a $10 donation. Donations enable the Red Cross to prepare for, respond to and help people recover from this disaster. RED CROSS RESPONSE Preliminary reports indicate more than 12,000 homes across four states have been affected. The Red Cross has deployed more than three-fourths of its emergency vehicle fleet, along with 5,500 disaster workers to provide relief. Working alongside dozens of partners, this help includes: Opened 378 Red Cross and community shelters with more than 97,000 overnight stays in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Today, nearly 1,000 people remain in shelters in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina. Served more than 1.1 million meals and snacks with the help of Southern Baptist Disaster Relief, and deployed 25 mobile kitchens. Distributed more than 238,000 relief items, including hygiene and cleaning supplies. Provided almost 23,000 health services, such as replacing lost medications and eyeglasses and emotional support contacts. ROLL UP A SLEEVE TO REPLENISH THE BLOOD SUPPLY Hurricane Matthew has had far-reaching impacts in the Southeast, forcing the cancellation of approximately 110 blood drives resulting in nearly 3,500 uncollected blood and platelet donations. Right now, there is an emergency need for platelet donations in many areas of the country. Platelets are a key clotting component of blood often needed by cancer patients that must be transfused within five days of donation. Eligible blood and platelet donors are urged to make an appointment as soon as possible to help replenish the blood supply for patients in need. Appointments can be made by using the Red Cross Blood Donor App, visiting redcrossblood.org or calling 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767). HELPING IN HAITI The American Red Cross, with a permanent team in Haiti of almost 200 staff, continues to work with local and international partners to deliver critical relief to aid many of the 175,000 residents displaced by Hurricane Matthew. American Red Cross and Haitian Red Cross teams have been distributing items including cholera-kits, hygiene kits and kitchen (cooking) kits, water purification products, shelter items and mosquito nets to meet people’s urgent needs. Cholera is an increasing threat due to damaged water systems and the lack of potable water; thus the provision of cholera kits —which contain items like soap, water purification tablets and oral rehydration salts – are an effort to help stem this threat. The American Red Cross is also supporting the Haitian Red Cross in coordinating between local authorities and other humanitarian organizations, and is working directly with the United States government to help distribute relief supplies. In addition, the American Red Cross has also brought in and set up generators and telecommunications equipment to support communications capabilities and deployed 11 disaster response specialists to lend their humanitarian relief expertise in areas such as emergency distribution and telecommunications support. In Haiti, the American Red Cross currently estimates spending more than $4 million to help the country recover. To date, the American Red Cross has received approximately $400,000 in donations and pledges specifically for the Caribbean, including Haiti. In addition, the American Red Cross will utilize some funds raised for the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, which were allocated specifically for contingencies and unexpected events such as disasters, as well as funds from grants and other donations designated for international causes.

Target has installed 147 megawatts (million watts or MW) of solar capacity on 300 stores, according to the 2016 Solar Means Business Report from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). "We're incredibly proud of the progress we've made in improving building efficiencies and reducing environmental impact. Our commitment to installing solar panels on 500 stores and distribution centers by 2020 is evidence of that progress," John Leisen, vice president of property management at Target, said in the SEIA statement. Walmart had held the top spot for the previous four years and still claims second place with 145MW of solar power installed on 364 buildings, according to the SEIA, which has been tracking corporate solar deployments for the past five years. This year, real estate developer Prologis came in third with 107.8MW of solar. Apple, which is in fourth place with 93.9MW of installed solar power, is a likely contender for first place sometime next year. Last year, Apple announced it was investing $850 million in a solar power plant through a partnership with First Solar, one of the nation's largest photovoltaic (PV) manufacturers and provider of utility-scale PV plants. Through a 25-year purchasing agreement, Apple will get 130MW from the new California Flats Solar Project. The project is currently under construction and is expected to be completed by the end of this year. Other Top 10 companies recognized in the SEIA's report include Costco (50.7 MW), Kohl's (50.2 MW), IKEA (44 MW), Macy's (38.9 MW), General Growth Properties (30.2 MW) and Hartz Mountain Industries (22.7 MW). While IKEA is in seventh place, it powers 91% of its retail locations through solar, according to the SEIA. Overall, U.S. corporations have doubled their solar installations year over year and are expected to close out 2016 with nearly 280MW of solar power -- compared to 130MW in 2015. The SEIA's report covers corporate solar installations in 38 states plus Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico; it tracks almost 1,100MW of solar installations at 2,000 U.S. companies. "To put that in context, that's enough electricity to power the equivalent of 193,000 homes every year," the report stated. "Also noteworthy, in just the first three quarters of 2016, the report found 142MW of corporate solar was added in the U.S., more than was installed in all of 2015 (129 MW)." In 2014, frustrated by a lack of renewable energy and a purchasing system that's too complicated, major U.S. companies joined an initiative to force the government and utilities to change. Along with the World Wildlife Fund and the World Resources Institute, the corporations signed a pact supporting six principles to clearly identify what's needed when purchasing renewable energy. The initial companies included Bloomberg, Facebook, General Motors, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Johnson & Johnson, Mars, Novelis, Procter and Gamble, REI, Sprint and Walmart. The companies called for six specific changes they wanted the energy industry to adopt to increase renewable energy use: Greater choice in procurement options More access to cost competitive options Longer- and variable-term contracts Access to new projects that reduce emissions Streamlined third-party financing Increased purchasing options with utilities "Solar plays a vital role within our renewable energy portfolio," Mark Vanderhelm, vice president of energy for Walmart, said in a statement. "This is evident by our 2020 commitment of doubling solar energy projects at our Walmart stores, Sam's Clubs and distribution centers across the nation. Our focus is on finding those solar projects that are right for the business."

"The effects of Hurricane Matthew are still causing significant flooding in parts of North Carolina and South Carolina. We are here providing food, shelter, relief supplies and other support to help thousands of people whose lives have been upended by this storm," said Brad Kieserman, Red Cross vice president, Disaster Operations and Logistics. "We're in the middle of a vast response, and our work is far from over. The Red Cross will be here as long as people need our help. MAKE A DONATION The massive Red Cross relief effort in response to Hurricane Matthew in the U.S. could cost between $24 – $28 million as volunteers continue to help in the weeks ahead while residents recover from the devastation – yet, the Red Cross has raised only $8.1 million in designated donations and pledges for the response to Matthew thus far. The Red Cross depends on donations to provide immediate relief. Help people affected by Hurricane Matthew by visiting redcross.org, calling 1-800-RED CROSS, or texting the word MATTHEW to 90999 to make a $10 donation. Donations enable the Red Cross to prepare for, respond to and help people recover from this disaster. RED CROSS RESPONSE Preliminary reports indicate more than 12,000 homes across four states have been affected. The Red Cross has deployed more than three-fourths of its emergency vehicle fleet, along with 5,500 disaster workers to provide relief. Working alongside dozens of partners, this help includes: Opened 378 Red Cross and community shelters with more than 97,000 overnight stays in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Today, nearly 1,000 people remain in shelters in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina. Served more than 1.1 million meals and snacks with the help of Southern Baptist Disaster Relief, and deployed 25 mobile kitchens. Distributed more than 238,000 relief items, including hygiene and cleaning supplies. Provided almost 23,000 health services, such as replacing lost medications and eyeglasses and emotional support contacts. ROLL UP A SLEEVE TO REPLENISH THE BLOOD SUPPLY Hurricane Matthew has had far-reaching impacts in the Southeast, forcing the cancellation of approximately 110 blood drives resulting in nearly 3,500 uncollected blood and platelet donations. Right now, there is an emergency need for platelet donations in many areas of the country. Platelets are a key clotting component of blood often needed by cancer patients that must be transfused within five days of donation. Eligible blood and platelet donors are urged to make an appointment as soon as possible to help replenish the blood supply for patients in need. Appointments can be made by using the Red Cross Blood Donor App, visiting redcrossblood.org or calling 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767). HELPING IN HAITI  The American Red Cross, with a permanent team in Haiti of almost 200 staff, continues to work with local and international partners to deliver critical relief to aid many of the 175,000 residents displaced by Hurricane Matthew. American Red Cross and Haitian Red Cross teams have been distributing items including cholera-kits, hygiene kits and kitchen (cooking) kits, water purification products, shelter items and mosquito nets to meet people's urgent needs. Cholera is an increasing threat due to damaged water systems and the lack of potable water; thus the provision of cholera kits —which contain items like soap, water purification tablets and oral rehydration salts – are an effort to help stem this threat. The American Red Cross is also supporting the Haitian Red Cross in coordinating between local authorities and other humanitarian organizations, and is working directly with the United States government to help distribute relief supplies. In addition, the American Red Cross has also brought in and set up generators and telecommunications equipment to support communications capabilities and deployed 11 disaster response specialists to lend their humanitarian relief expertise in areas such as emergency distribution and telecommunications support. In Haiti, the American Red Cross currently estimates spending more than $4 million to help the country recover. To date, the American Red Cross has received approximately $400,000 in donations and pledges specifically for the Caribbean, including Haiti. In addition, the American Red Cross will utilize some funds raised for the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, which were allocated specifically for contingencies and unexpected events such as disasters, as well as funds from grants and other donations designated for international causes. CORPORATIONS HELP  The generous donations from members of the Red Cross Annual Disaster Giving Program (ADGP) and the Disaster Responder Program enable the American Red Cross to prepare communities for disasters big and small, respond whenever and wherever disasters occur and help families during the recovery process.

The major averages eventually ended the session on opposite sides of the unchanged line. While the Nasdaq rose 15.57 points or 0.3 percent to 5,257.40, the Dow dipped 16.64 points or 0.1 percent to 18,145.71 and the S&P 500 edged down 0.18 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 2,141.16. For the week, the Dow edged slightly higher, while the S&P 500 climbed by 0.4 and the Nasdaq advanced by 0.8 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq benefited from a strong gain by Microsoft (MSFT), with the software giant jumping by 4.3 percent. With the gain, Microsoft reached a record closing high. The advance by shares of Microsoft came after the company's first quarter adjusted earnings per share and revenues exceeded forecasts, helped by a strong performance by its Cloud business. Global payments company PayPal (PYPL) also moved notably higher after reporting third quarter earnings that matched estimates and a growing number of active accounts. Shares of McDonald's (MCD) moved to the upside after the fast food giant reported third quarter earnings and sales that beat analyst estimates. Global same-store sales rose 3.5 percent during the quarter. Meanwhile, General Electric (GE) closed modestly lower after the conglomerate reported third quarter earnings that beat estimates but on lower than expected revenues. GE also lowered its full-year revenue growth forecast. Sector News While many of the major sectors ended the day showing only modest moves, considerable strength was visible among internet stocks. Reflecting the strength in the sector, the Dow Jones Internet Index advanced by 1.8 percent. PayPal helped to lead the sector higher, although j2 Global (JCOM), Twitter (TWTR), and VeriSign (VRSN) also posted notable gains. Tobacco stocks also saw some strength on the day, with Reynolds American (RAI) rising sharply after British American Tobacco (BTI) offered to acquire the 58 percent stake in the company it does not already own for $47 billion. On the other hand, natural gas stocks came under pressure over the course of the session, dragging the NYSE Arca Natural Gas Index down by 1.7 percent. Southwestern Energy (SWN) posted a steep loss after reporting weaker than expected third quarter earnings. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly lower during trading on Friday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index fell by 0.3 percent, while Australia's All Ordinaries Index dipped by 0.2 percent. The Hong Kong markets were closed for a holiday. Meanwhile, the major European markets ended the day roughly flat. While the German DAX Index inched up by 0.1 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index and the French CAC 40 Index both edged down by 0.1 percent. In the bond market, treasuries showed a lack of direction before closing roughly flat for the third consecutive session. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, edged down by less than a basis point to 1.740 percent. Looking Ahead Next week's economic calendar is relatively light, but traders are likely to keep an eye on reports on consumer confidence, new home sales, durable goods orders, and third quarter GDP. A slew of well-known companies are also due to release their quarterly results next week as earnings season hits full stride. Visa (V), 3M (MMM), Caterpillar (CAT), General Motors (GM), Procter & Gamble (PG), Sprint (S), AT&T (T), Coca-Cola (KO), Dow Chemical (DOW), Sony (SNE), UPS (UPS), Twitter (TWTR), and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are just a few of the companies due to report their results. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Preview: Thanksgiving Week Economic Data Top Ten Corporate Comeback Stories The Most Influential Books In Business More Top Stories Fiat Chrysler Recalls Cars For Wiper, Fuel Leak Issues Stocks Move Modestly Lower Amid Quiet Trading Day - U.S. Commentary Dupont Will No Longer Contribute To Pensions Fitch Warns On Trump Trade Policies Stocks Seeing Modest Weakness In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary Trump Taps Sessions As AG, Pompeo As CIA Director, Flynn As Security Advisor Stocks Showing A Lack Of Direction In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary U.S. Leading Economic Index Inches Higher For Second Straight Month Sen Sessions To Be Attorney General, Gen Flynn Touted As NSA: Reports CFO Shake-up For Actuant Ohio Congressman Challenges Nancy Pelosi For House Dem Leader Japanese Prime Minister Abe Says He Has Great Confidence In Trump Stocks May Show A Lack Of Direction In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary Trump Reportedly Picks Sen.

The evening opened with the national anthem by "The President's Own" United States Marine Band, "God Bless America" by Janine Stange followed by inspiring remarks from the Second Lady of the United States, Dr. Jill Biden. "Our country has one sacred obligation -- to equip those we send to war and to care for them and their families during deployments and when they return home," Biden said. "This commitment to our military and their families is something that you, the USO, does better than anyone else." Gala attendees included the USO Board of Governors, corporate sponsors, senior military officials, honorees and their families. Special guests included members of the 75th Anniversary Honorary Committee including the iconic Ann-Margret along with Trace Adkins, Nigel Barker, Carla Hall, Craig Morgan, Kellie Pickler, Warrick Dunn, Alex Trebek and Miss USA 2016 Deshauna Barber. Together, they collectively represent the talent that donate countless hours to support the USO and entertain American service members around the world. Chef Robert Irvine -- a British Royal Navy veteran and tireless USO supporter -- designed the fall-inspired menu and Ryan Seacrest presided over the evening as master of ceremonies and shared his earnest sentiments about the USO's milestone year. "For 75 years, the USO has delivered programs and services that connect, support, comfort and inspire America's troops and their families wherever they serve," Seacrest said. "As someone with deep and abiding respect for our service men and women and the sacrifices they and their families make every day on behalf of our country -- it has been a tremendous joy and pleasure to share this evening with you." Guests were treated to an exclusive preview of USO's 75th anniversary documentary, "USO - For The Troops," made possible by Johnson & Johnson, the Official Healthcare Partner of the USO. Partisan Pictures' filmmaker and producer Peter Schnall was on hand to lend his support and Courtney Billington, an Army veteran and Johnson & Johnson Vice President of Janssen Supply Chain, invited all who attended to watch the full documentary set to air Nov. 7 on PBS. After a heartfelt tribute to USO celebrity entertainers past and present -- USO CEO and President Dr. J.D. Crouch II took the stage and proudly introduced the USO's new Force Behind the Forces -- a campaign that aims to bridge the military-civilian drift by inviting all Americans to take action in support of service members. "The American people must remain engaged with their military, and our Force Behind the Forces campaign aims to connect the American people to those they serve," Crouch said. "Today's USO -- your USO -- has been 75 years in the making, and our milestones were achieved because of the network of volunteers, partners, corporate donors and service chiefs who have never wavered in supporting this noble cause." The Grammy Award-winning Zac Brown Band delivered a passionate four-song set and spoke about their experiences connecting with service members on USO tours to the war zone. PenFed Credit Union, Deloitte, LLP and the National Football League served as the Chairman's Circle for the evening, and USO leaders acknowledged the many contributors who have donated to the organization's Force Behind the Forces: A $7.5 Million Challenge Campaign -- an effort supporting the expansion and refurbishment of more than 35 USO centers and programs by the end of 2016. Warrick Dunn, a former NFL player and avid USO supporter, announced the NFL recently contributed $5 million to the USO and that a portion will go to the USO's Challenge Campaign. "This funding will help serve more than 125,000 service members and military families, which means a better experience for more than 2 million visitors to USO centers each year," Dunn said. "I hope you will stop and think of the men and women in service tonight. Go back to your families and work places and do what you can to express your personal gratitude." The first award of the evening -- presented by retired Army General George W. Casey, Jr., Chairman of the USO Board of Governors -- went to The Coca-Cola Company, this year's Spirit of the USO Honoree. Coca-Cola has proudly served on the front lines with the USO since World War II, helping provide service members with the kindness, caring, comfort, compassion, encouragement and support they deserve. "Tonight on behalf of all of my Coca-Cola associates, we thank you for this kind award, and we commit to being part of the team for the next 75 years," said J. Alexander M. Douglas Jr., Executive Vice President and President, Coca-Cola North America. The Pritzker Military Museum and Library President and CEO Kenneth Clarke paid special tribute to Janice K. Emmert -- a tireless advocate of the USO's mission for decades. Emmert died in July, and the USO renamed its highest volunteer award in her honor. Two honorees, Ron Meier of the Bob Hope USO in Palm Springs, California, and Ralph Nelsen of USO Osan, South Korea, proudly received the award. Air Force General Paul J. Selva, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, joined service chiefs and senior military officials to honor six service members from each service branch. Miss USA 2016 Deshauna Barber -- an Army Reserve officer -- presented each service member with their well-deserved award. Selva ended the evening by acknowledging the community of USO supporters and entertainers who serve as the driving force behind the more than 180 networked USO locations worldwide. "If you do the numbers, over 35 million soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and Coast Guardsmen, and countless family members have been touched by the USO," Selva said. "Those of us who wear the cloth of the nation or stand behind those who wear the cloth of the nation thank you."

About the USO The USO strengthens America's military service members by keeping them connected to family, home and country, throughout their service to the nation. At hundreds of locations worldwide, we are united in our commitment to connect our service members and their families through countless acts of caring, comfort, and support. The USO is a private, non-profit organization, not a government agency. Our programs, services and entertainment tours are made possible by the American people, support of our corporate partners and the dedication of our volunteers and staff. In addition to individual donors and corporate sponsors, the USO is supported by President's Circle Partners: AT&T, the BNSF Railway Foundation, Clark Construction Group, LLC, The Coca-Cola Company, FedEx, Jeep, Johnson & Johnson, Kroger, NFL, Southern New Hampshire University and Four-Star Partners: Advisors Excel, BIC, ConAgra Foods, GEICO, Harris Teeter, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, Starbucks, TKS, USAA and the Wawa Foundation. We are also supported through the United Way and Combined Federal Campaign (CFC-11381). To join us in this important mission, and to learn more about the USO, please visit uso.org.
