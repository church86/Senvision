But he earned those bad boys long before the Houston Texans snapped him up with the No. 12 pick. On the day before the biggest day of his life, the two-time Heisman Trophy finalist reflected on the milestones that led him to that moment. As a game-changing quarterback, Watson is used to being in the eye of the storm. But as Complex linked up with him in the Procter & Gamble VIP Style Lounge while he was getting the finishing touches on his look, he was honest about the pressures of being a top prospect. He told us about the unlikely influences that kept him on the straight and narrow, and how the draft process—his biggest job interview ever—compared to the four previous gigs he had to hold down. And he explained the “memo” he wants to send with everything from his social media to his suit. Image via USA TODAY Sports/Bill Streicher First of all, you said there would “be consequences” if Mitch Trubisky were drafted higher than you. What did you mean by that? Right, well it wasn’t anything bad or any diss or anything like that. Consequences just means, it could be good consequences, or it could be bad. I’m just saying “Hey, if that’s who y’all want, if that’s who y’all take, don’t second guess it. And you gon’ get the consequences that come behind it.” Regardless if it’s Mitch or if it’s me, it’s the same way—it could be bad or good. That’s how I saw it. We’re both competitors, we both support each other, we both want the best for each other, and we both feel like we’re one of the top quarterbacks in the draft. Did the projections that he’d be drafted higher make you feel underrated? Not at all. ‘Cause I know who I am and I know what I can do, and I know what I’ve done before, so that’s people’s opinions; if that’s how they feel then that’s how they feel. Regardless of the situation, I’m still gonna be me and do my thing. Scrolling through your ‘gram, it’s clear that you’re a hip-hop fan. Is Future on the pregame playlist? I love hip-hop. He’s one of my favorites. Probably if I had to pick, my favorite would be [YFN] Lucci. That’s my boy. I guess I’m biased because I know him. [Laughs.] Lucci, Future, Young Thug, Lil Uzi, Drake, those are probably the top ones. OK, since we’re talking hip-hop, who are you going with if it’s K.dot versus Big Sean? Ooh shoot! I don’t know. I’m gonna just stay in the middle. Gonna stay neutral? OK, that’s smart. So we’re here in the Old Spice room. Right now is a special time as you start to build your brand. Why did you decide to align with Old Spice in particular? I wear Old Spice, so I kinda thought it was a good relationship to build and try to prove on, and so we partnered up this week, and they’re making sure I stay clean and fresh for the big day tomorrow. Old Spice is known for having really quirky commercials. Are you comfortable with that; do you feel you have the personality for it? [Laughs] I think I do. I don’t come off like it at first, but once I’m comfortable, then I can do all that stuff. I noticed on social media that you tend to sign your posts 815™. What’s the story behind that? 815 is the neighborhood I was born and raised in, 815 Harrison Square is the exact name. It’s in Gainesville, Georgia. It was just where I was raised, and everything just kinda started flowing. It was where I started playing football, really focusing on school, then also the struggles and adversity I went through that kind of helped me grow as a man and as a young boy, all started there. It was a tough neighborhood? One of the toughest in Gainesville, so it was a lot of struggling, but at the same time it was kind of the norm, so it’s all I really knew. Would you say sports is what kept you out of trouble? I’d say so. Sports and then also, the older guys in the hood made sure I stayed out of trouble. Even though I was trying to look up to them, they saw greatness in me and they made sure I stayed on the right path. Another tag of yours is Memo™. Where does that come from? Memo kind of started ‘cause Young Thug came out with the song “Memo,” and it was one of my favorite songs. I always said, “Hey, you get the memo?” So it’s like saying make sure you get the memo. Actually, my suit tomorrow it has memo and 815 in the lining. So the suit—y’all get the memo. On that note, what are your DMs looking like? The DMs? [Laughs.] Uh, they’re straight. Is it going down? Let’s say I haven’t checked them. [Laughs.] All right, that's fair. You were raised in a Habitat for Humanity home and gave back to the organization throughout your collegiate career. Do you plan to continue to support them, and why is it important? I think so, just because it made an impact in my life. Living in Harrison Square where we were before it was a struggle, a lot of different bad things going around. And then once I moved out of that environment and got to a more safe and more laid-back environment, it kind of changed my life and made me see life differently. Gave me hope, gave me dreams that I wanted to accomplish, and started a new way for our family. Declaring for the draft puts you under so much scrutiny, not just your on-field performance but the way you carry yourself. What’s been the most surprising or challenging part of the entire process? The most challenging part is trying to work out and then travel at the same time. Trying to get your throws in, get in the weight room, do all that stuff, and also be able to hit the road, visit these teams, work out for these teams, and then also go to the draft, and then the next week start playing football again. It’s not really the best thing, I think, but I guess that’s how they’ve been doing it for a long time, so I think that’s the hardest part. Ideally you’d like to space some of this out? Right, splitting it up, and have this month for just workouts or just like visits—I don’t know, something.   Memo™ 💯 Lets Eat! Photo by: @jp.hoto A post shared by Deshaun Watson (@deshaunwatson4) on Mar 16, 2017 at 3:50pm PDT Has any pro athlete—not just in football—reached out and shared any advice? Floyd Mayweather, he gave me advice just to stay in your lane, never get satisfied, and learn more about the business; don't just learn about your sport, learn about the whole business because it’s only going to last for so long. Really you’re your own CEO, so you wanna be as productive and wealthy as you can while you can. A lot of athletes came through and gave similar advice: “Stay strong. Be you,” just really encouraging me. Have you ever had a “regular job”? I have. Actually, I had four. I was a ball boy for the Atlanta Falcons, I was a tax assessor—this was all in high school—I was an account assistant at the courthouse, and then I was a real estate assistant. Image via USA Today Sports Why did you have four jobs? Because I had to help my mom out because she went through her situation. She had cancer, so she was away a lot, she was out of work, so me and my older brother had to get some money to make sure food was on the table and make sure my little brother and little sister was straight. That’s amazing. How would you compare your first job interview to the combine? Totally different. [Laughs.] I was comfortable at both, but the Combine is just more…I don’t know the word…I don’t want to say all over the place, but so much going on, so many eyes on you. A regular interview is just one on one; just be yourself and you can kill that, but the Combine you gotta be straight perfect. Because they’re grading you on so many different aspects— Right, and you don’t even know it. Tell me more about this tax assessor business. It was 10th and 11th grade in Hall County, Georgia. It wasn’t me by myself. I was with a guy who’d worked there a long time. You know, I’d just ride around with him house to house to house and just kinda make sure their taxes were—he had some form of paperwork, but my job was easy, I just kinda showed up. I kinda watched and helped him out. And the first one you said was ball boy. I’m sure that was very formative. Yeah, it was fun. Falcons is literally 10 minutes from my house; they’re like right there. Every training camp I’d work for them, be the ball boy for Matt Ryan, throw to the receivers, and I worked every home game. I started in ninth grade and I did it all the way until twelfth. It was real cool. They knew who I was, and they’d show love and support.  Is there an experience that stands out? Really the biggest is of course the games. Being on the sidelines and in the locker rooms for the games, I felt like I was a player. And then, just being able to throw to the receivers, getting to know Julio Jones and Roddy White. And now they’re going to be your colleagues—and competitors. I’m sure that’s a cool feeling for you. It is.     WatchNow Tags: Features, Interviews, Houston Texans, NFL Draft, NFL, Clemson, Deshaun Watson  Like  Follow  Chat Show Comments Lateststories With Marc Stein's Layoff, Speculation Is Increasing That Adrian Wojnarowski Might Join ESPN BY Aaron Mansfield 7 hours ago In an Instant, Texans Draft Pick Deshaun Watson's Idols Became His Rivals BY Dria Roland 9 hours ago Rugby Player Goes Absolutely Ballistic, Punches Out Referee Before Fighting Opponents BY Gavin Evans 9 hours ago NFL Draft Pick Wins $40,000 Bet With Dad Over Where He Was Selected BY Chris Yuscavage 11 hours ago Music Rick Ross Makes a Plea to Carmelo Anthony and Snoop Dogg Reflects on the L.A.

Larry MacDonald Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday, Apr. 28, 2017 4:41PM EDT Last updated Friday, Apr. 28, 2017 4:41PM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Michael Byrne Occupation Sales associate The portfolio Primary holdings include Shopify Inc., Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Procter & Gamble Co., AT&T Inc., General Electric Co. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. The investor Mr. Byrne started investing around the time of the 2008 financial crisis. “I really had no idea what I was doing and got burned a few times,” he remembers. “But I loved the process and kept at it.” How he invests Mr. Byrne is intrigued with investing in underappreciated companies, particularly those that have good growth prospects. When expectations are low, “you often get some nice gains on even minor good news,” he declares. One of his largest positions is Shopify, a provider of cloud-based commerce platforms for small and medium-sized businesses. It is Mr. Byrne’s most successful investment to date and he plans on holding it for years to come. “Obviously, e-commerce and online shopping is a huge secular trend and I was looking for a way to get exposure to that but felt Amazon had already had a huge run,” Mr. Byrne says. “I was looking for something different.” He found it in Shopify. Its revenue increased 90 per cent in 2016 and Mr. Byrne sees strong growth continuing in years ahead as more merchants sign up to use its platform and as recent partnerships with Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and others bear fruit (the collaborations let Shopify clients sell products on their websites). Mr. Byrne likes how Shopify’s stock “keeps surging even without a lot of the media coverage that high-flying tech stocks like this would usually garner.” He expects a fresh wave of interest in the company when it “catches the eyes of people like the hosts on CNBC.” Best move “My best investment move of all time was investing in Shopify when it was in the high $20s and sticking with it through a few early declines,” Mr. Byrne reports. The price is now above $70 (on the U.S. stock market). Worst move “Investing in a ‘hot’ new company in China that later was exposed as a fraud and went to zero.” Advice “I would tell other investors, especially younger ones, to jump in and just get started,” he advises. “Get started early while time is on your side and you have many years of compounding gains ahead of you.” Want to be in Me and My Money?

Earnings Drop on Industry Slowdown The consumer goods titan couldn't buck the weak overall market trends in its fiscal third quarter. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Apr 28, 2017 at 10:00AM Given the recent slump in the branded consumer products industry, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) investors had modest expectations heading into this week's quarterly report. But while the headline numbers weren't exciting, the owner of the Tide, Pampers, and Bounty franchises managed modest sales and profit growth. P&G also affirmed its full-year outlook on both the top and bottom lines. More on that forecast in a moment, but first, here's how the big-picture results stacked up against the prior-year period: Metric Q1 2017 Actuals Q1 2016 Actuals Change (YOY) Revenue $15.61 billion $15.76 billion (1%) Net income $2.56 billion $2.78 billion (9%) EPS $0.96 $1.00 (4%) Data source: P&G financial filings. YOY = year over year. Sales and profits Revenue growth slowed for the second straight quarter, with organic sales gains weighing in at 1% thanks to a slight volume increase as prices held steady. That broader result put the company ahead of rival Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB), which earlier in the week announced a 1% drop in organic sales. P&G also beat its key diaper rival by managing a healthier mix of volume and pricing. In a worrying sign for the Gillette brand, though, organic sales dove 6% in the grooming category. P&G has seen its global dominance slip in the razors-and-blades industry, and this week's results suggest continued struggles against major competitors like Unilever (NYSE:UL) and its online-based Dollar Shave Club. Unilever is trouncing peers overall right now, boosting sales by nearly 3% this past quarter. P&G's profits showed modest improvements. Core gross profit margin dipped by 20 basis points as significant efficiency gains were overwhelmed by rising commodity costs and increased spending on brand support. Expense discipline helped protect bottom-line profitability, though. Despite a boost in marketing and research and development spending, core operating profit ticked up slightly to keep the company near the top of the industry on this key metric. Management and outlook CEO David Taylor focused on the operating and financial wins that P&G managed despite a tough overall market. "The third quarter macro environment was characterized by a slowdown in market growth, continued geopolitical disruptions, and foreign exchange challenges," he said in a press release. Still, "against this backdrop we delivered modest organic sales growth and double-digit core EPS growth," Taylor added. Image source: Getty Images. Executives also highlighted P&G's recent announcement of a 3% boost to the dividend payout that marked a solid acceleration over last year's 1% uptick. The consumer goods giant has now raised its dividend for 61 consecutive years. P&G affirmed its full-year outlook, which projects organic sales gains speeding up to a 2.5% pace from 1% last year. That would put the company ahead of Kimberly-Clark and the roughly 1.5% growth it is targeting. P&G is still on track to trail Unilever, though, which is projecting 4% gains at the midpoint of guidance. Investors can't be excited that the results imply further market share losses and suggest continued declines in the Gillette shaving franchise. On the other hand, P&G's operations are becoming more profitable and the company is making progress toward returning to market-beating sales gains. The company also expects to turn 95% of its net earnings into free cash flow this year -- up from the prior forecast of 90%. That financial strength will produce plenty of flexibility for P&G to navigate a rough selling environment while continuing to invest in its brands and sending big piles of cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson 28 Apr 2017 06:07PM Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail REUTERS: Procter & Gamble Co , maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors, reported an 8.3 percent fall in third-quarter profit hurt by a strong dollar and slowing economic growth that dampened consumer spending in several countries. Economic and political uncertainties - from higher gas prices in the United States and higher utility prices in Saudi Arabia to demonetization in India - triggered a sharp brake in consumer spending during the quarter, the company said on a post-earnings conference call. Making matters worse, the U.S. dollar rose about 3.6 percent in the March quarter, on an average, compared with a quarter earlier, spurred by investors betting on the so-called "Trump trade". A strong dollar makes U.S. goods less competitive abroad, and foreign earnings less valuable when converted into dollars. P&G, which sells its brands in more than 180 countries, gets nearly half its revenue from Europe, China, Asia and the Middle East. "We continue to deal with an unprecedented amount of geopolitical disruption and uncertainty, which is affecting market growth, currencies and commodities," Chief Financial Officer Joe Moeller said on the call. Advertisement "We're aggressively driving cost savings to mitigate these impacts." P&G has said it plans to save as much as US$10 billion in costs over the next five years, and use a chunk of those savings to improve packaging, research and development, and sales coverage. The company's stock, which has jumped 10.6 percent in the past year, fell as much as 2 percent in morning trading on Wednesday. The S&P 500 index has risen 6.6 percent in the same period. SALES FALL AGAIN The consumer goods giant, whose iconic brands include Pampers, Head-and-Shoulders and Vicks, maintained expectations of a mid-single digit rise in full-year adjusted earnings per share growth, and a 2-3 percent increase in organic sales growth. Net income attributable to the Cincinnati, Ohio-based company declined to US$2.52 billion, or 93 cents per share, in the three months ended March 31. Adjusted earnings came in at 96 cents per share, beating Wall Street estimates by 2 cents. Organic sales in P&G's two largest businesses - fabric and home care, and baby, feminine and family care - rose 1 percent. Organic sales at its grooming business fell 6 percent. Net sales fell about 1 percent to US$15.61 billion - the thirteenth straight quarter of declines. Analysts had been looking for US$15.73 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. P&G, which traces its roots to a family-run candle and soap business in 1837, has been selling off unprofitable brands and focusing on core brands such as Tide and Pampers to revive sluggish sales. It sold 41 of its brands, including Clairol and Wella, to Coty Inc in a US$12.5 billion deal in October.

By Kathryn Hopkins on April 28, 2017 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk View Slideshow   View Gallery — 6   Photos While the late British-born legendary hairdresser Vidal Sassoon is often linked with Los Angeles’ glamorous Bel Air neighborhood, a little known fact is that Cincinnati also had a place in his heart. It all started when rights to his name and image were sold to Procter & Gamble and he was contractually obliged to spend some time in the Ohio city where the consumer goods giant is headquartered, according to broker Lee Robinson of Robinson Sotheby’s International Realty. It was there he met his fourth wife, Cincinnati native Rhonda “Ronnie” Holbrook, who worked on a P&G account at a local marketing firm, and they ended up buying two homes in the Mt. Adams neighborhood. While PropertyShark’s records show that their first home was sold in 2007 for $900,000, the second, which they bought for $1.2 million in 2006, has just been listed for sale with a barely inflated $1.25 million price tag. And if the listing pictures are anything to go by, it wasn’t just the architecture of the bob that Sassoon, who died in 2012, was interested in as the property is also architecturally significant for the area. After all, he once told ‘Architectural Digest’ that “architects have always been my heroes.” The pale brick-clad contemporary four-story, 4,966-square-foot home was designed by well-known local architect Carl Strauss in 1966 and is believed to be the first home in the area with an elevator to all floors. The unique home gives you the feeling of living in a tree house, thanks to its hilltop location high overlooking trees and boasts three balconies offering views of the Ohio River and Downtown Cincinnati. Features of the four-bedroom, two-bathroom property include spacious rooms, vaulted ceilings, three fireplaces, brick walls, large windows which allow lots of natural light and a grand central staircase. Of Ronnie’s decision to sell, Robinson said she’s not in the city very often as she has homes in Los Angeles, New York and Connecticut. She sold their Richard Neutra-designed mansion in Bel Air for $16.5 million in 2012, according to Zillow. You're missing something! Activate your FREE PREVIEW now.

Elyse Dupre, Special Features Editor April 27, 2017 Fem or Foe: Do Brands Promoting Femvertising Actually Practice What They Preach? Share this content: facebook twitter linkedin google Email Print Photo: Dove's Campaign for Real Beauty Advertising has long been a men's game. You can't even spell the word advertisement without “men” in it. But more and more advertisers are rethinking the ways they portray women in campaigns and how women respond to them — so much so, in fact, that the industry has introduced a new term: femvertising. SheKnows Media, the women's lifestyle media company that coined the term, defines femvertising as “advertising that employs pro-female talent, messages, and imagery to empower women and girls.” It's not a cry for brands to portray women as better than men. It's a call-to-action to show both genders accurately and equally. “As we evolve the concept of femvertising, it's really going towards more equality…of the genders through media and advertising,” says Samantha Skey, president and chief revenue officer of SheKnows Media. Several factors have contributed to the femvertising movement — “none of which are just for the betterment of mankind or womankind,” Skey says. She points to consumer demand and interest, as well as to conversations sparked from social media and Sheryl Sandberg's book Lean In. But the main drivers, she says, are concerns for how advertisers influence the next generation of women and girls and how brands impact the way women view themselves today. Consider: A SheKnows Media study found that 90% of women surveyed say ads that show women as sex symbols are harmful, and a survey by beauty brand Dove revealed that 69% of women polled say increasing pressures from advertising and media to reach unrealistic beauty standards produce appearance anxiety. Marc Pritchard, chief brand officer for consumer packaged goods giant P&G, believes that advertising can be a “force of good” — and he would know. P&G's feminine hygiene brand Always became the golden child of femvertising when it launched its #LikeAGirl campaign in 2014 and turned the common insult of doing something “like a girl” into an empowering phrase. “We reach five billion people on the planet every day with our 65 brands, and advertising has an impact on how people see themselves,” Pritchard said at the 2017 Tina Brown Women in the World Summit in New York. “And therefore, as the largest advertiser, we can be a force for good.” Still, like all advertising, brands launch femvertising campaigns to ultimately sell products. The SheKnows Media survey found that 53% of consumers say they'll make purchases because they like how women are portrayed in a brand's ad. And at the Women in the World Summit, Pritchard said that ads that portray gender equality have a 26% higher purchase intent rating. While brands have a financial motivation to engage in femvertising, it's important to see if their marketing messages are matched by their internal structures, like hiring practices, corporate programs, and donations. In other words, are brands marketing this kind of gender equality messaging actually practicing what they're preaching, or are they just jumping on the feminist bandwagon to make a buck? This article will take a closer look at three brands' femvertising campaigns and analyze whether these companies are walking the walk or just talking the talk. Dove If there's one brand that's synonymous with femvertising, it's Unilever's beauty brand Dove. Nick Soukas, VP of marketing for Dove, says it's been 60 years since the brand debuted its Dove Beauty Bar, and the brand is working to make the standards of beauty more inclusive, such as by launching Dove Real Beauty Productions: a "collaborative studio" initiative done in partnership with TV producer Shonda Rhimes that helps women share their personal beauty stories through film.  But Dove's first foray into femvertising dates back to 2004 when it launched the “Campaign for Real Beauty.” Soukas says the campaign was born out of research the brand commissioned that found that only 2% of surveyed women described themselves as beautiful. For Soukas, these findings highlighted something bigger than the brand; they highlighted a societal issue. The definition of beauty was becoming “unattainable” and “limiting,” he said, and women had gotten used to “blonde, skinny, blue-eyed” models as being the industry standard. “Women were not seeing themselves represented in advertising,” Soukas stated in an email interview. “And as a global beauty brand, we felt a deep responsibility to change this. “ Soukas said Dove wanted to broaden the definition of beauty and have it serve as “a source of confidence” rather than a source of anxiety. So, the brand created a series of billboards highlighting women with different physical attributes — most of which didn't match advertisers' traditional standards of beauty. The billboards asked consumers to judge these women's physical appearances by checking one of two tick boxes. A billboard featuring a woman with freckles asked viewers to indicate whether the woman was “flawed” or “flawless,” for instance, while an ad featuring a woman with gray hair asked if she was “gray” or “gorgeous.” Consumers could cast their votes by visiting the campaign's website. Then in 2005, Dove kicked off the second phase of “Campaign for Real Beauty” by featuring six real women with relatable bodies and curves in its advertisements. These ads drove people to CampaignForRealBeauty.com where they could discuss relevant beauty issues. According to DMN's sister publication Campaign, the ads drove a 700% increase in Dove firming product sales during the first half of the year.  Dove has been promoting this type of femvertising ever since and has caught the attention of millions of consumers. More than 50 million people viewed Dove's 2013 "Real Beauty Sketches" ad within 12 days of its release, according to Dove, and its 2016 “My Beauty, My Say” spot has more than 12.9 million views on Dove's U.S. YouTube channel. Soukas also noted that the number of women who consider themselves beautiful has increased from 2% to 4%. Dove has continued to profit from this femvertising movement, too. Although Soukas said Dove doesn't disclose sales information, Ad Age reported that the brand's sales increased from $2.5 billion in the first year of “Campaign for Real Beauty” to $4 billion in 2014. But Soukas doesn't consider Dove's femvertising profits a bad thing. In fact, he describes it as a win-win for both the brand and its consumers. “We truly believe profit and purpose can work well together to achieve the right balance,” he said, “and we are proud to have a brand mission that makes sense for our business and provides a wider benefit to society. When consumers choose Dove's products, they are helping to support the Dove brand's vision to create a world where beauty is a source of confidence, not anxiety.” Profits aside, one has to wonder if Dove actually lives by its own pro-female messaging. In many cases, it does. Dove launched several female empowerment initiatives after its “Campaign for Real Beauty.” In 2006, it launched the Dove Self Esteem project — a program that aims to promote positive self-image and confidence in the next generation of women. According to Soukas, Dove has reached more than 20 million young people through this type of education, and it intends to reach an additional 20 million by 2020. The brand also committed to “The Dove Real Beauty Pledge,” which promises to feature “real women” (not models) in all of its advertisements, avoid digital distortion, and encourage body confidence and self-esteem. In addition, Unilever's executive team has a strong female presence. According to the company's website, five out of 10 of Unilever's executive leaders are women. Still, no brand has a perfect track record, and it can be difficult to home in on the right message. For instance, media companies condemned Dove for tricking women into thinking patches could improve self esteem and for making them appear so gullible in the “Dove: Patches” ad. Others criticized the brand for conveying that high self-esteem is only achieved through feeling beautiful (as opposed to feeling funny or smart) in Dove's “Choose Beautiful” campaign. Whatever the response, Soukas values feedback. “Our relationship with real women and girls is our greatest pride, and we take their feedback into great consideration,” he said. “With each campaign, we work to deepen our relationship with women and, no matter the response, we continue to move toward our goal of inspiring a world where beauty is a source of confidence, not anxiety.” Other speculation has stemmed from ads produced by Dove's sister brand Axe. Sexualization is a recurring theme in many of the male grooming brand's advertisements, which often feature attractive models and suggestive messages like “the cleaner you are, the dirtier you get.” This stark contrast to Dove's pro-female campaigns has made people question how authentic Unilever's messaging can be. “How could the same company that launched Dove's Campaign for Real Beauty…be behind the arguable degrading depictions of females in ads for Axe?” read a case study written by Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management that was cited in U.S. News and World Report. While Dove issued a statement saying Unilever tailors its brand efforts to “reflect the unique interests and needs” of each respective audience, it looks like the company is changing Axe's tone. According to Unilever's 2016 Annual Reports and Accounts, Axe is taking a more "progressive" stance on masculinity and attractiveness. This is exemplified in its 2016 “Find Your Magic” campaign — an ad that encourages men to embrace personal style and go against traditional standards of masculinity.  Axe is also participating in Unilever's #UnStereotype initiative — a call-to-action for all Unilever brands to avoid dated, stereotypical portrayals of different genders in its ads. “In 2016, we listened to consumers and looked at the way we portray gender in our advertising and realized we needed to change,” Unilever stated in its Annual Reports and Accounts. So, is Dove's Real Beauty messaging real? Yes. But it looks like the brand and its parent company need to continue to evolve its gender portrayals if it hopes to resonate with consumers in the future.

Organised and hosted by Process Systems Enterprise (PSE), providers of the gPROMS APM platform, the two-day conference is a key annual event for process industry organisations focused on creating sustainable value through the application of high-accuracy predictive process modelling and optimisation. Keynote speaker Jan van Schijndel of VS Strategic Consulting, formerly head of GTL development at Shell, outlined a vision for Operational Excellence capable of bringing $40-80m per annum improvements in process economics for large-scale petrochemical plants. Brian Henry, Vice President for Drug Product Design at Pfizer, described how digital design techniques that draw on technologies developed and proven in other areas are changing the way the industry develops and manufactures drugs, based on a fundamental understanding of process and product performance. In the formulated products sessions, aimed at the pharmaceuticals, food & beverage and consumer goods sectors, presentations from GSK, Roche, AstraZeneca, Dr Reddy’s, Eli Lilly, Procter & Gamble, Danone and FrieslandCampina described the application of advanced mechanistic modelling in improving drug product manufacture, increasing food product throughput and reducing energy costs and CO2 footprint. New technologies such as global system analysis are now allowing manufacturers to systematically explore the decision space to an unprecedented degree. This accelerates innovation and significantly decreases time-to-market for new formulations. It also reduces process uncertainty, resulting in more robust processes. Also at the Forum, PSE and Dutch food research organisation NIZO announced the formation of a Centre of Excellence for Food Product & Process Modelling, and PSE provided a preview of the all-new gPROMS FormulatedProducts environment for integrated design and optimisation of formulated products and their manufacturing processes, scheduled for release in May. In the chemicals, petrochemicals and energy & environment sessions, where presenters included Shell, Sabic, SCG Chemicals, DSM, Primetals and Velocys, the focus was again on the application of large-scale optimisation techniques to reduce operating costs or enhance product values to the tune of millions or tens of millions of dollars per year. The Oil & Gas session similarly focused on new multi-site and integrated asset optimisation approaches for maximising asset utilisation. Conference organiser Mark Matzopoulos, PSE Marketing Director, said “a key takeaway of the conference is that the maturing of advanced process and materials modelling techniques and tools is making it increasingly easy for process organisations – whether pharma, food manufacture or petrochemicals – to deal with systems of enormous complexity. The increased understanding enables them to make better-informed decisions faster, resulting in competitive advantage and accelerated innovation”.

The sector has been on a tear since last summer, when in response to the vote to leave the European Union, the BoE said it would use its firepower to buy corporate paper from September 2016. Ahead of the central bank announcing the completion of its £10bn corporate bond purchase scheme (CBPS) - 11 months earlier than originally scheduled - there was some trepidation that the vibrancy of the market would be undermined. But this week US consumer company Procter & Gamble raised £750m in its first sterling outing for 15 years, and UK utility Thames Water paid only a minimal premium for its second dual-tranche trade of 2017, a £550m subordinated note carved into six and 10-year maturities. The deal attracted £1.4bn of demand. Meanwhile the significant pipeline primed for next week's business indicates that activity remains healthy. "The sterling market was fully functioning before the Bank of England introduced CBPS," said Marco Baldini, head of European bond syndicate at Barclays. "And it has remained well bid since the BoE's CBPS completion announcement which itself was expected, and since the bank is not active in the sterling primary market, I would argue that the transmission mechanism between the sterling secondary market is in any case less direct." DOUBTS RAISED Nonetheless the BoE's withdrawal and upcoming Brexit negotiations have prompted some to begin questioning sterling as a strategic market for international borrowers. "It's a home-grown market and one that has provided issuers and investors with duration of up to 40 or 50-years, but we expect more credit spread widening, and therefore more international companies will lose the rationale for issuing," said one senior official at a US bank. As the market anticipated an early end to the BoE programme, initially slated for March 2018, spreads widened 4bp earlier in April. However, they have since recovered, with the iBoxx GBP non-financials index at Gilts plus 135bp at Thursday's close, 6bp tighter than when the BoE announced its programme in August. And the more prominent sterling houses argue that the UK market still has a lot to offer. "Clearly, there is some uncertainty around the Brexit negotiations, but we fully expect the sterling market to continue to offer attractive financing options to international borrowers as well as domestic," said Jonathan Peberdy, head of syndicate at NatWest Markets. "The sterling market has always proved resilient in times of adversity, it has a large and sophisticated community of investors and the UK will remain a large and important economy." Sterling has typically been the go-to European market for borrowers and investors alike in need of duration. Over the past three years 37% of sterling corporate supply has been at 15-years or longer; the equivalent figure in euros is 5%, according to NatWest Markets. "It remains the local base for a range of UK corporates to raise money and enables issuers to raise very long term debt, as well as price more complex/esoteric structures," said Jonathan Platt, head of fixed income at Royal London Asset Management. FLOODGATES OPEN The central bank has so far bought £9.978bn of bonds as part of the scheme (settled as of April 26), and is expected to announce the final weekly purchase volumes next week. That is equivalent to around half of the £20bn of sterling corporate investment-grade issuance seen since the programme was announced. However, the removal of the BoE's backstop bid is not expected to deter issuance in the near term, with spreads forecast to hold steady following a string of successful deals last week. The pipeline includes global engineering group GKN Holdings, which will hold investor meetings next week for a 12 to 15-year benchmark deal. In the high yield crossover space, insurer Saga plc, Ba1/BB+ (Moody's/S&P), will meet investors in London and Edinburgh from May 2 for a debut, likely seven-year, benchmark. The market can also expect to see some M&A supply from BAT as its acquisition of Reynolds draws closer. BAT intends to refinance two bridge facilities and said it would sell a mix of debt in US dollars, sterling and other currencies, although investors expect most to be in dollars.

Former Lib Dem MP who dated Cheeky Girl Gabriela Irimia and rumoured Celebrity Big Brother housemate The parliamentary romancer has had a unusual life from high profile relationships, near fatal paragliding accidents and even a short stand-up career By Guy Birchall 28th April 2017, 12:30 pm Updated: 28th April 2017, 7:10 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments LEMBIT Opik was a Liberal Democrat MP for 13 years who frequently hit the headlines for his high profile love life. The former Welsh Lib Dems leader became hugely recognisable as he appeared on countless television programmes. Daily Mirror 6 Former Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Opik and partner Sabina Vankova who is seven months pregnant Recently, rumours suggested he could be a contestant in Celebrity Big Brother and reunite with former ex-fiancee and Cheeky Girl Gabriela Irima. Now he’s announced his partner Sabina Vankova is pregnant, despite fears a childhood accident might “have left him sterile”. How old is Lembit Opik? What’s his background? Lembit Opik was born in Bangor, Co Down, Northern Ireland on March 2 1965. His parents had fled their native Estonia after it was occupied by the USSR under Joseph Stalin. He has an older sister named Urve and hand a younger brother, Endel, who died in 2005. His grandfather was a respected astronomer and astrophysicist who spent the second half of his career at the Armagh Observatory and has an asteroid named after him as well as a crater on Mars’ moon Phobos. Lembit would go on attend the University of Bristol before beginning a career at consumer goods company Procter and Gamble in Newcastle upon Tyne. Rex Features 6 The former MP for Montgomeryshire spent 13 years in Parliament from 1997 to 2010 When did Lembit Opik get into politics? During his time in Newcastle, Opik was elected onto the Liberal Democrats’ Federal executive committee. He was elected as a councillor in the city in 1992 and in the same year unsuccessfully stood in the general election for the Newcastle upon Tyne Central constituency. Two years later he would also fail to get elected as a Lib Dem MEP for Northumbria in the European Parliament elections. In 1997 he finally won the seat of Montogomeryshire in Wales after the sitting Lib Dem MP retired. How long was Opik’s his parliamentary career? Opik held the seat from 1997 to  2010, when he was ousted by Tory Glyn Davies. During his time in parliament he served as the Lib Dem spokesman on education, Northern Ireland, Wales, business and housing. Times Newspapers Ltd 6 His first high profile relationship was with ITV weathergirl Sian Lloyd but the pair split in 2006 From 2001-2005 he was a member of he agriculture select committee and was also leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats from 2001-2007. He twice unsuccessfully stood for the party presidency in 2004 and 2008. What has happened in Opik’s life outside politics? Outside Westminster, Opik has been the focus of much media attention for two high profile romances. The first was with ITV weathergirl Sian Lloyd with whom he appeared on a celebrity version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire in April 2006. But the couple later split in October that year with Lloyd blasting the then MP in her autobiography. She claimed Opik’s boozing and womanising were two things that destroyed their relationship blasting his “rowdy drunken behaviour” and claiming they would down two bottles of wine in a night. PA:Press Association 6 He would later start stepping out with Cheeky Girl Gabriela Irimia who was just 24 when they started dating He later struck up a romance with Gabriela Irimia, one half of pop double act The Cheeky Girls, who was then just 24-years-old. The announced their engagement after Opik popped the question on a Roman holiday, but the couple separated in July 2008 following what was described as a “difficult period”. Other TV shows he has appeared on include a celebrity version of The Apprentice, Celebrity Come Dine With Me, I’m a Celebrity…Get Me Out of Here and Celebrity Juice. twitter/Sabina Vankova 6 Lembit revealed he kept their baby news a secret because he feared he had been left sterile after impaling himself on a tree What is Opik doing now – and when is baby due? Opik is currently the campaigns and communications director for the Motorcycle Action Group, a position he has held since November 2013. He also has a fledgling career as a stand-up comedian as well as holding a pilot’s licence. Last year he had surgery to realign his jaw which suffered substantial damage in 1998 following a paragliding accident. He plunged 80 feet to the ground in north Wales in a near fatal collision in which he broke his back in 12 places, his ribs and sternum as well as his jaw. Opik also hosts a regular Friday discussion programme on BBC Radio Kent. His pregnant partner, Bulgarian property lawyer Sabina Vankova, 33, is expecting a baby girl in less than two months. Lembit revealed he wanted to keep the baby news a secret because he feared he had been left sterile after impaling himself on a tree which damaged his “personal parts” in an accident in 1971, Daily Mirror reported. Daily Mirror 6 The pair met in July 2015 at a party to celebrate Tim Farron’s election as Lib Dem leader Former fiancees  Sian Lloyd and Gabriela Irimia both miscarried while pregnant by him. He told the Daily Mirror: “I’ve twice been in situations where I tried to have children, which both ended in miscarriage. “I didn’t want to talk about this pregnancy until I was sure things would be OK. I remain wary, because until a child is born you’re still dealing with a pregnant.” His wife posted a picture of a positive pregnancy kit on Twitter.

The good news is that more and more companies are recognizing this and setting goals. Almost half of Fortune 500 companies (48 percent) have at least one climate change or clean-energy target on the books, an increase from years past. These findings and more comprise a joint report from the World Wildlife Fund, Calvert Investments, CDP and Ceres entitled Power Forward 3.0: How the largest US companies are capturing business value while addressing climate change. The cohort of researchers insist emissions-reduction projects save money: Almost 80,000 projects employed by 190 companies netted almost $3.7 billion in savings last year alone. The annual emissions reductions from these projects equated to taking 45 coal-fired power plants offline for one year. Both the largest and smallest Fortune 500 companies are leading the way. The Fortune 100, the largest companies in the index, continue to be the leaders: 63 percent of them have set one or more clean energy targets. Forty-four percent of the smallest 100 companies in the index have set goals in one or more categories, a 19 percent increase from 2014. Companies within the consumer staples sector have the largest amount of companies with targets, while the energy sector has the smallest amount. Corporate goals are more ambitious than ever One of the most significant new trends among the Fortune 500 is the increasing ambitiousness of the goals, with more companies moving to create science-based targets and set 100 renewable energy goals, the cohort representing NGOs and an investment body concluded. As of January, 210 companies set targets through the Science Based Targets initiative, which galvanizes corporate goal-setting based on climate science. These leaders include American multinationals like Procter & Gamble, General Mills and Kellogg. The Science Based Targets initiative is a collaboration between the WWF, CDP, World Resources Institute and the United Nations Global Compact, in partnership with the We Mean Business Coalition. For what it’s worth, 72 percent of the Fortune 500 (14 percent) reported to either CDP or the Science Based Targets initiative that they intend to adopt a decidedly science-based target within a few years. For its part, consumer packaged goods giant P&G is committed to reducing the emissions from operations by 30 percent by 2020 from a 2010 base-year, according to a Science Based Targets case study. During this time frame, P&G will address the main source of emissions across its value chain, which include targets related to cold-water washing, post-consumer plastic use and zero-deforestation policies. Before setting the target, the company had already committed to sourcing 30 percent of its energy from renewables. And P&G isn’t alone. Renewable energy is looking attractive to a growing number of companies. Almost two dozen Fortune 500s committed to power all of their corporate operations with 100 percent renewable energy, mainly wind and solar. Last year, only a handful of companies made such a commitment. Some of the companies pledged to 100 percent renewables are Walmart, Bank of America, Google and Facebook.  A goal to source only renewable energy is a “signal of high ambition,” the most recent joint report states. And company size is a “key indicator of the likelihood” of setting such a target: 14 of the targets come from companies in the Fortune 100, with four in the Fortune 101-200, three in the Fortune 201-300, and just two in the Fortune 301-400. There are no companies in the bottom quintile of the Fortune 500 with a 100 percent renewable energy target. All 23 companies with such a goal are in four sectors: information technology, financials, consumer staples, and health care. While only a fraction of Fortune 500 companies have adopted such an ambitious goal, more than double the amount (53 companies) have set a target to buy or invest in renewables such as wind and solar. Companies are using various approaches to meet their targets, including unbundled renewable energy certificates (RECs) purchases, onsite installations (mainly solar), and larger-scale, off-site purchases. Since the Power Forward 2.0 report, 33 companies signed almost seven gigawatts (GW) in new, direct and off-site corporate renewable energy contracts, with most of them in the Fortune 500.

Tags india complexion World Skin lightening products under fire as Indians seek whiter shade of pale Reuters | Friday, Apr 28, 2017 Reuters Friday, Apr 28, 2017 MUMBAI - Mirror, mirror on the wall - who is the fairest of them all? The one with the palest skin, of course. Or that's the idea behind India's multibillion-dollar skin lightening industry, with a host of 'fairness' products appearing to offer dark-skinned Indians a lighter, fairer, better version of themselves. Now the industry has come under fire after a popular Bollywood actor lashed out at India's obsession with fair skin and highlighted a persistent bias against darker faces. "You have to stop buying into the idea that a particular shade is better than others," Abhay Deol, an actor known for playing offbeat roles, said on his Facebook page this month. Deol lambasted his Bollywood peers - including Shah Rukh Khan, John Abraham, Shahid Kapur and Deepika Padukone - for endorsing so-called fairness brands and urged them to stop using their popularity to peddle products he called racist. "(These) campaigns are blatantly, and sometimes subtly, selling you the idea that whiter skin is better than darker skin," said Deol. NOT FAIR Controversy around 'fairness' products has raged for decades, with darker skin shades variously described as "dusky" and "wheatish", and lighter tones sold as more attractive. The market - which includes creams, face washes, deodorants, even a vaginal whitener - is estimated to be worth about 270 billion rupees ($4 billion) and is growing at a steady clip. Unilever Plc's Hindustan Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Nivea, Garnier and Emami are among those making fairness products. Hindustan Unilever's Fair & Lovely, launched in 1975, is India's best known fairness brand, and claims to be the world's first of very many skin-lightening cream. Scientists say some contain harmful bleaching ingredients. The World Health Organisation banned the active ingredients - hydroquinone and mercury - from unregulated skin products. Research firm Centre for Science and Environment said in a 2014 study that nearly half the creams it tested in India contained mercury, which is "completely illegal and unlawful". A spokeswoman for Hindustan Unilever declined comment on the controversy. CASTE AT ROOT OF RACISM Some activists link the bias to an entrenched caste system, where higher-caste Brahmins generally have lighter skin. In a country where arranged marriages are still the norm, matrimonial ads consistently describe a woman's complexion, and dark-skinned women often pay a higher dowry, activists say. Bullying and taunting of dark-skinned girls and women is common, while dark-skinned actors complain of fewer roles. Advertising campaigns for various brands have typically depicted women - and increasingly men - as winning better jobs and partners, thanks to the fairness creams. But Kiran Khalap, co-founder of brand consultancy Chlorophyll in Mumbai, said the adverts were not to blame. "Our obsession with fair skin didn't come from HUL or Emami: it's a deep-seated cultural bias that equates being fair with being superior," he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. "When a demand for a product exists, a manufacturer will cater to that demand. And people will buy that product, even without a Shah Rukh or a John Abraham telling them to buy." DARK IS BEAUTIFUL Nor is India alone in buying into the 'fairness' dream. Similar products are on sale in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and in parts of Africa, although India, with its population of 1.3 billion people, is a prized consumer market. Ivory Coast and Ghana have banned cosmetics containing hydroquinone, which critics say can cause cancer. A similar ban exists in Japan, South Africa and the European Union. Nivea recently pulled an ad in the Middle East with the tagline 'White is Purity' after it was slammed as racist. Advocacy group Women of Worth launched a 'Dark is Beautiful' campaign in 2009 with the tagline 'Stay unfair, stay beautiful,' to fight the "toxic belief that a person's worth is measured by the fairness of their skin". Members of India's upper house have called for a ban on advertisements for fairness products. There has also been legal action. A Delhi consumer court said in 2015 said Emami's advertisements for Fair and Handsome were a misrepresentation of the product's effectiveness. Emami has appealed the verdict. A spokeswoman for the company declined comment. Just last week, Times of India, the country's biggest English-language daily, ran a message about its popular matrimonial ads. "Don't you think it's unfair to ask a girl to be fair and bautiful?" the message read. "Henceforth, we hope that atrimonial ads will inspire people to choose girls based on heir education rather than only their looks." But filmmaker Ram Subramanian wants action, not words, and is video on the topic has been viewed almost 3 million times. "Once upon a time slavery was acceptable, the caste system as acceptable, until someone said they were not," he said. "I want the government to ban these products because they cause so much damage," he said. Sign up for our e-newsletter now!

Growth investors tend to be younger and more aggressive, as they are looking to build long-term wealth for their old age. Income investors are typically older and more cautious, as they want to protect the investment gains made in their younger years while generating an income to fund a comfortable lifestyle in retirement. However, these camps aren’t as opposed as you might think, because one of the best ways of generating growth is to invest for income. You do this by investing in top companies that pay dividends, regular payouts made to shareholders as reward for holding their stock. Many investors overlook these dividends, as they are typically just a few cents or pence per share, but over the years they can roll up into big money. The key is to reinvest those dividends back into your portfolio for growth, rather than taking them as income. That way you benefit from the miracle of compound interest, as reinvested dividends gradually accumulate more shares, which earn you more dividend income, year after year. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at the online trading company IG, which has offices in Dubai, says investing for dividends has become more popular as the income on cash and bonds has slumped since the financial crisis. "You can get income of anything between 2 and 7 per cent a year from top blue-chip companies quoted in the UK, US, Europe and emerging markets, far higher than on most other investments," he says. Often the returns from your income can dwarf those from capital growth. Take the UK’s FTSE 100, which is full of dividend-paying global stocks such as the oil majors BP and Royal Dutch Shell, miners BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, and international banks such as Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered. The FTSE 100 currently trades 12.8 per cent higher than 10 years ago, but with dividends reinvested the total return is a far healthier 64 per cent, according to figures from online investment platform AJ Bell. Investors who had targeted individual income stocks may have generated a much more spectacular return. Global cigarette giant British American Tobacco’s share price grew 238 per cent over the decade, but with reinvested dividends the total return is an even more impressive 412 per cent. It currently yields 3.22 per cent. Similarly, mobile phone operator Vodafone yields a generous 5.66 per cent. Its share price grew just 42 per cent over the past decade, but the total return is 150 per cent with dividends reinvested. Defence manufacturer BAE Systems grew 38 per cent over 10 years but delivered a total return of 117 per cent including dividend growth. You can invest for dividends either by purchasing individual company stocks, through a low-cost exchange traded fund (ETF) or an actively managed mutual fund: Dividend stocks The longer you invest for, the longer you have for those dividends to roll up and compound interest to work its magic. Dan Dowding, a director at investment advisers AES International in Dubai, quotes figures from investment house Woodford Asset Management which shows how dividend income is the ultimate growth machine. "£1,000 [Dh4,706] invested in the UK stock market in 1926 would have appreciated at a compound annual growth rate of 5.4 per cent a year and grown to just over £100,000 today. With dividends reinvested, it would be worth £7.8 million," he explains. The best dividend-paying stocks tend to be large, established, cash-generative and often multinational businesses, that aim to increase their dividend year after year. For example, British American Tobacco has increased its dividend at an annual compound growth rate of 9.9 per cent a year, and Vodafone by 4.8 per cent. This allows you to lock into a rising income – and rising growth prospects. The key figure to look for is the yield, which is calculated as the annual dividend payout divided by the share price. However, Mr Dowding says you should never simply plump for the highest possible yield because a dizzying dividend may reveal a company in trouble. In December 2015, yields at global commodity companies Anglo American and Glencore topped out at 14 per cent and 12.5 per cent respectively, as their share prices and profits collapsed in the face of dwindling demand from China. That level of generosity simply wasn’t sustainable, and shortly after both companies took the axe to their dividends. Today, Anglo American yields nothing, while Glencore pays just 0.93 per cent. Mr Dowding says one way to check the safety of a yield is to look at the company’s dividend "cover", which shows how many times over it can pay a dividend from its profits. Cover of two times or more is ideal. Anything below one is a concern. Some companies have a distinguished track record of increasing their dividends year after year. For example, top US companies Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, Emerson Electric, 3M Corporation and Cincinnati Financial increased their dividends for an incredible 50 consecutive years or more. Mr Dowding says the best dividend payers tend to be listed on the UK and US markets. "London-listed stocks have historically paid the higher dividends". He tips Shell, which yielded 7.15 per cent at time of writing. The company is renowned for never having cut its dividend since the Second World War, although if the oil price stays below US$50 for an extended period, that proud record could be broken. Vodafone is another favourite, currently yielding 5.66 per cent, and although cover is currently thin at just 0.4, this is expected to improve as profit rises, and the yield is forecast to hit 6.3 per cent by 2019. Mr Dowding also likes the London-listed pharmaceutical group GlaxoSmithKline, which yields 5.11 per cent and utility National Grid, which yields 4.33 per cent. He also picks out five US stocks, all familiar, established names with slightly lower yields than their UK rivals: Johnson & Johnson, which yields 2.68 per cent, IBM (3.42 per cent), Microsoft (2.36 per cent) and Cisco Systems (3.33 per cent), and ExxonMobil (3.75 per cent). Chris Beauchamp at IG suggests UK-listed consumer goods companies Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever, which both have strong long-term dividend track records. "You might also try some European companies, where top dividend payers include insurers Allianz, Axa and Zurich Insurance, pharmaceutical companies Bayer and Roche Holdings, motor manufacturer Daimler and Finland’s Nokia." Exchange-traded funds Buying individual company stocks may be too risky for many individuals, but there is a low-cost method of spreading this risk. Mr Dowding says the simplest and lowest risk way to benefit from the compounding miracle of reinvested dividends is to buy a low-cost tracker ETF fund. "These may track an index, such as the FTSE 100, which currently yields approximately 3.6 per cent, or the S&P 500, which yields 1.97 per cent." Alternatively, you could buy an ETF that invests in a basket of attractive dividend stocks, such as iShares Core High Dividend ETF, which currently yields 3.50 per cent, and iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF, which yields 2.17 per cent. These invest in top US companies such as ExxonMobil, AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Chevron, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, Philip Morris, Coca-Cola, Cisco, JP Morgan Chase and Apple. If you want a spread of international stocks you might consider the DJ Global Select Dividend Ucits ETF from UBS, which invests across Australasia, Europe, the US, UK and Canada, and currently yields 4.35 per cent. Top holdings include US internet company CenturyLink, broadcaster Sky Network Television and UK builder Carillion. Another option is the iShares Stoxx Global Select Dividend 100 Ucits ETF, which tracks the 100 leading dividend-paying global stocks from the Stoxx Global 1800 Index, and currently yields 3.94 per cent. Top holdings include Shell, UK budget airline easyJet and the National Australia Bank. Mutual funds You might also consider investing in a mutual fund, where the active fund manager selects a portfolio of income stocks on your behalf. Mellissa Gallagher, a director at Allianz Global Investors, recommends Merchants Trust, which has increased its dividends for the past 34 years. "Fund manager Simon Gergel invests in a diversified portfolio of large, well-established and well-known UK companies, and currently yields 5.66 per cent," says Ms Gallagher. Merchants is an investment trust, a special type of London-listed fund that can be traded like a share. They have a long pedigree and three have increased their dividends for an incredible 50 consecutive years: City of London Investment Trust, which currently yields 3.73 per cent, Bankers Investment Trust (2.21 per cent) and Alliance Trust (1.86 per cent). Phil Smeaton, chief investment officer at global wealth advisers Sanlam, tips the Schroder Income Maximiser Fund, run by Thomas See, which aims to pay the maximum possible income and currently yields 7.17 per cent a year. He also tips the other UK-focused income funds, CF Miton UK Multi Cap Income, Royal London UK Equity Income and the Threadneedle UK Equity Alpha Fund. Those who want exposure to Europe might consider BlackRock Continental European Income Fund, which invests in companies such as Zurich Insurance Group, Spanish telecoms company Telefonica, and Italian transport infrastructure company Vinci. It currently yields 4.08 per cent. Jupiter European Income, which yields 3.10 per cent, and Liontrust European Income, yielding 3.86 per cent, are also worth considering. Sheridan Admans, investment research manager at UK stockbroker The Share Centre, tips the Guinness Asian Equity Income, which gives you exposure to high-quality dividend-paying companies in the Asia Pacific region. "Fund manager Edmund Harriss takes a long-term view and invests on a high conviction basis with typically 36 positions in his fund," says Mr Admans. The fund currently yields 3.76 per cent and has delivered a total return of 61 per cent over the past three years. pf@thenational.ae Follow us on Twitter @TheNationalPF Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Personal Finance Paying for memories gives value for money This week in money Inside investment: Investing advice to follow, but with just a few caveats Dubai resident annoyed over small print in health insurance MOST VIEWED Business | All Blame Alitalia’s employees for this latest scary scenario for the airline Dh59m Dubai villa has Palm Jumeirah’s biggest private swimming pool – in pictures Seven mistakes to avoid in a job interview Mediclinic shares surge on change to Abu Dhabi co-pay rules Fifa Club World Cup travel packages start at Dh1,380, says Abu Dhabi Sports Council Paying for memories gives value for money Oil sector squeezed by rising costs and investment slump First look at Warner Bros World Abu Dhabi theme park attractions – in pictures Ethiopian dam creates waves Emirates set to go all-A380 in flights to Melbourne More Most Viewed World’s former heaviest woman to be transported to Abu Dhabi for life-saving surgery Make Nashville great again?

The one with the palest skin, of course. Or that’s the idea behind India’s multibillion-dollar skin lightening industry, with a host of “fairness” products appearing to offer dark-skinned Indians a lighter, fairer, better version of themselves. Now the industry has come under fire after a popular Bollywood actor lashed out at India’s obsession with fair skin and highlighted a persistent bias against darker faces. “You have to stop buying into the idea that a particular shade is better than others,” Abhay Deol, an actor known for playing offbeat roles, said on his Facebook page this month. Abhay lambasted his Bollywood peers — including Shah Rukh Khan, John Abraham, Shahid Kapur and Deepika Padukone — for endorsing so-called fairness brands and urged them to stop using their popularity to peddle products he called racist. “(These) campaigns are blatantly, and sometimes subtly, selling you the idea that whiter skin is better than darker skin,” said Abhay. Nor fair  Controversy around “fairness” products has raged for decades, with darker skin shades variously described as “dusky” and “wheatish”, and lighter tones sold as more attractive. The market — which includes creams, face washes, deodorants, even a vaginal whitener — is estimated to be worth about 270 billion rupees (RM17.4 billion) and is growing at a steady clip. Unilever Plc’s Hindustan Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Nivea, Garnier and Emami are among those making fairness products. Hindustan Unilever’s Fair & Lovely, launched in 1975, is India’s best known fairness brand, and claims to be the world’s first of very many skin-lightening cream. Scientists say some contain harmful bleaching ingredients. The World Health Organisation banned the active ingredients — hydroquinone and mercury — from unregulated skin products. Research firm Centre for Science and Environment said in a 2014 study that nearly half the creams it tested in India contained mercury, which is “completely illegal and unlawful”. A spokeswoman for Hindustan Unilever declined comment on the controversy. Caste at root of racism  Some activists link the bias to an entrenched caste system, where higher-caste Brahmins generally have lighter skin. In a country where arranged marriages are still the norm, matrimonial ads consistently describe a woman’s complexion, and dark-skinned women often pay a higher dowry, activists say. Bullying and taunting of dark-skinned girls and women is common, while dark-skinned actors complain of fewer roles. Advertising campaigns for various brands have typically depicted women — and increasingly men — as winning better jobs and partners, thanks to the fairness creams. But Kiran Khalap, co-founder of brand consultancy Chlorophyll in Mumbai, said the adverts were not to blame. “Our obsession with fair skin didn’t come from HUL or Emami: It’s a deep-seated cultural bias that equates being fair with being superior,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “When a demand for a product exists, a manufacturer will cater to that demand. And people will buy that product, even without a Shah Rukh or a John Abraham telling them to buy.” Dark is beautiful  Nor is India alone in buying into the “fairness” dream. Similar products are on sale in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and in parts of Africa, although India, with its population of 1.3 billion people, is a prized consumer market. Ivory Coast and Ghana have banned cosmetics containing hydroquinone, which critics say can cause cancer. A similar ban exists in Japan, South Africa and the European Union. Nivea recently pulled an ad in the Middle East with the tagline “White is Purity” after it was slammed as racist. Advocacy group Women of Worth launched a “Dark is Beautiful” campaign in 2009 with the tagline “Stay unfair, stay beautiful”, to fight the “toxic belief that a person’s worth is measured by the fairness of their skin”. Members of India’s upper house have called for a ban on advertisements for fairness products. There has also been legal action. A Delhi consumer court said in 2015 said Emami’s advertisements for Fair and Handsome were a misrepresentation of the product’s effectiveness. Emami has appealed the verdict. A spokeswoman for the company declined comment. Just last week, Times of India, the country’s biggest English-language daily, ran a message about its popular matrimonial ads. “Don’t you think it’s unfair to ask a girl to be fair and beautiful?” the message read. “Henceforth, we hope that matrimonial ads will inspire people to choose girls based on their education rather than only their looks.” But filmmaker Ram Subramanian wants action, not words, and his video on the topic has been viewed almost three million times. “Once upon a time slavery was acceptable, the caste system was acceptable, until someone said they were not,” he said. “I want the government to ban these products because they cause so much damage,” he said. —Thomson Reuters Foundation                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week World’s oldest gymnast, 92, stars in Singapore's International Ageing Week Hundreds displaced as Bahamas luxury festival implodes Soy protein may ease inflammatory bowel disease, study finds In Muslim Indonesia, tiny Jewish community lives on Why a combination of exercise and vitamin D could be good for your heart Local YouTuber asks fans to Photoshop her — and the internet responds In Muslim Indonesia, tiny Jewish community lives on Design thinking for professional productivity Cash is king no more China's ‘Christmas Town’ opens doors to Middle East migrants but future uncertain Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Reuters Video: Nationwide strike hobbles Brazil Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Here’s the first trailer for ‘Kingsman: The Golden Circle’ Related Articles Resign if you disagree with Zakir Naik’s PR, Perkasa tells MIC chief Hak sama rata, bangsa Malaysia aspirasi belia India dalam TN50 Ample India: An inspiring example ― Roger Cohen Amazon, Flipkart battle in India for e-commerce’s ‘last frontier’ Dalai Lama accuses China of fooling its people (VIDEO) Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

By Tom Foremski for Tom Foremski: IMHO | April 28, 2017 -- 01:14 GMT (18:14 PDT) | Topic: E-Commerce Grad Conn in center in blue at Sprinklr media dinner. The average job tenure of the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) continues to decline and is now less than half that of the CEO's average of 7.2 years. I recently met Grad Conn, CMO of Microsoft USA and I was impressed by what he had to say and his approach. We spoke at a recent media roundtable dinner organized by Sprinklr -- an enterprise-ready social media toolset used by Conn and a team of more than 150 Microsoft social media managers. The first thing Conn told me was that he has been in his job nearly twice as long as the industry average. Job security is certainly uppermost in the minds of CMOs -- even the successful ones. Here's some of my notes into Conn's approach to social media and job security: - Conn said that he had to accept that much of what he had learned about marketing in school and as a former P&G product marketing executive was wrong or was no longer as effective. - To understand the social media platforms such as Twitter it is important to be active in them. Experience is important because they change all the time. Read this Enterprise social media: New battleground for CIO influence As social media strategy becomes more important, CIOs and IT have a new lever to drive conversation with peers in marketing and other departments across the company. Read More - It is important to be responsive to any issues and to give your social manager managers the authority to quickly respond and to take conversations into a private channel. - Standardizing on a set of tools and metrics is important. The changing nature of digital media should be supported by your toolset and integrated into management dashboards. For example: Sprinklr says it is constantly integrating newly acquired technologies and creating new services - The CMO has to have the confidence to publish a lot and has to seek attention. Conn is very active online in many media platforms and also offline as a speaker. Foremski's Take: Grad Conn is a near perfect example of what a tech company CMO should be like. - He is comfortable with a reasonable degree of self-promotion and he constantly seeks attention online and also offline -- look at the way he dresses. - He is creating a persona and a following by knowing how to communicate publicly in an authentic and relevant manner. - He is very active as a self-publisher in social media, blogging, video and is a frequent speaker at conferences. - He has trained hundreds of social media managers to act independently and react to any crisis with full trust of the management. - He knows what tools to use, how to use them and why. - He understands that what works today in marketing might not work for long and that new marketing processes will constantly be needed. Most CMOs have mostly none of the above qualities. But they know how to keep their CVs updated.

(AAP) Previous Next Show Grid Previous Next Hide Grid Image 1/ Video Audio Solomon Thomas fondly remembers eating fish and chips and spending long days at the beach in Sydney as a child. Source: AAP 28 Apr 2017 - 12:08 PM  UPDATED YESTERDAY 12:08 PM Tweet Solomon Thomas, a 191cm-tall and 125kg defensive lineman who grew up on Sydney's beaches, has been selected by the San Francisco 49ers with the third overall pick in the NFL Draft. Jarryd Hayne's old NFL team was desperate to add a pass rusher to what has been a dismal defensive line in recent seasons. Thomas was born in Chicago and when he was two-years-old his father, an executive at consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble, moved the family to Sydney. They lived in Australia for five years, a period Thomas says he fondly remembers, including eating fish and chips and spending long days at the beach. "It was great as a kid to be exposed to a different culture, a different way of living," Thomas told FOX Sports in the US. "Be around a beautiful place. "Get to go to the beach all the time. "Start (life) in kind of an unconventional way, coming from Australia to the United States. "It definitely gave me a different perspective on life and definitely shaped me for life." The 49ers know 21-year-old Thomas well as he was a star at Stanford University, just a short drive to the NFL team's Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara. Thomas wreaked havoc on opposing quarterbacks in college with 14 tackles for loss and 8.5 sacks for Stanford in the 2016 season. The Cleveland Browns selected another pass rusher, Texas A&M defensive end Myles Garrett with the No.1 pick. The Chicago Bears made a surprise move by doing a deal with the 49ers, who had the second pick, to trade up to second for North Carolina quarterback Mitchell Trubisky. The Bears gave the 49ers the No.3 pick and a pick next year. Australia's top chance is punter Cameron Johnston, who after an outstanding stint at Ohio State, is a long shot of being a late round selection or picked up as an undrafted free agent. The three day draft is being held in Philadelphia.

McIntyre April 28, 2017 6:35 am EDT Print Email Tweet Earnings reports for the Big Five tech stocks — Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) — pushed their combined market cap close to $3 trillion. In particular, Amazon and Alphabet rallied sharply after better-than-expected results. Just a year ago, the value of the group was closer to $2 trillion. Apple still has to report earnings. With shares trading near an all-time high, it will need extremely strong numbers for its stock to rise sharply. However, some analysts have price targets near $180, well above the current $143 level. The same is true for Facebook, a stock on which the great majority of analysts have Buy ratings and price targets well above its $149 level. The stock prices year to date are already extraordinary, except for Microsoft, which is up 8% before reaction to its earnings. Alphabet’s shares are up 11%, Amazon’s 18%, Apple’s 23% and Facebook’s 27%. The dominance of these five companies in terms of their market values is fairly recent, and it shows the huge rotation toward tech as Wall Street’s favorite sector. A decade ago, a list based on the same criteria would have included Berkshire Hathaway, Exxon Mobil, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan, General Electric and Procter & Gamble. Four of these companies are over a century old. The old economy dominated by consumer products, energy and banking has started to fade away. There are reasonable arguments that the money that has moved into tech stocks will continue. Cloud computing may be the largest single business in enterprise computing. It is dominated by Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft. Google and Facebook control over half of all online advertising, and that market share is growing. Apple’s iPhone 8 release could drive sales more than any of its predecessors. Artificial intelligence consumer products are starting to be as much a part of consumer spending as traditional consumer goods. The rise of e-commerce continues to destroy the traditional parts of the retail business. The value of the Big Five may break the $3 trillion mark within a month or two, depending on Apple and Facebook earnings.

Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 20, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid 28 Apr 2017 05:51PM (Updated: 28 Apr 2017 06:44PM) Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail New York: U.S. stocks ticked lower on Wednesday following two sessions of strong gains as strong corporate earnings were offset by uncertainty over the feasibility of a proposed business tax cut. The proposal from the Trump administration slashes tax rates for businesses and on overseas corporate profits returned to the country. It offered no specifics on how it would be paid for without increasing the deficit. "A lot to digest on the tax side and to be honest we don’t have a lot of details at this point aside from just a few bullet points from the press conference," said David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas in New York. "This is going to be a bit of an uphill fight to get this plan enacted into law." The expectation of a corporate tax cut was partly behind the rally in U.S. stocks since the November election of Donald Trump. The market stalled over the last several weeks as the administration has failed to score a major legislative victory, Republican majorities in the House and Senate notwithstanding. Advertisement The S&P 500 traded above its record closing high throughout the day, however. Some analysts say even though tax reform would be a major boost to stocks, economic and earnings growth are enough to support current market levels. Overall profits of S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 11.8 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,975.09, the S&P 500 lost 1.16 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,387.45 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.27 point to 6,025.23. Despite the tick lower, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.37-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.62-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The tax proposal includes a cut on so-called pass-through business taxes that would deliver a windfall to investors in MLPs, master limited partnerships. Among stocks, United Technologies rose 1.1 percent to US$118.20 and provided the biggest boost to the Dow industrials after reporting a quarterly profit that beat expectations helped by higher sales in all four of its business units. "Earnings are very strong, you could see a 15 percent year-on-year growth on the S&P," said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer, Multi-Asset Strategies and Solutions at Voya Investment Management in New York. "We're seeing a global, synchronized up swing." On the flip side, Boeing shares fell about 1 percent to US$181.71 after the planemaker reported a decline in revenue. The S&P 500 posted 82 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 210 new highs and 28 new lows. About 7.33 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.44 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

MUMBAI|NEW DELHI: Many small retailers and wholesalers are restricting the quantity of products they buy from consumer goods companies, fearing that they may incur a loss when the country moves to goods and services tax (GST). The worry is that from July 1, GST would apply on the goods they sell, even if they had bought those before that date and already paid value-added tax, excise duty and other levies. While the government said that the seller would get a 40% deemed credit on the Central GST paid, experts said there could still be some loss. Also, CGST is just half the total GST, with the rest here being states' share -so the credit may not fully offset the taxes already paid. “Many distributors and retailers are reluctant to buy products that they think they would not be able to sell before July 1 when GST comes in,“ said Pratik Jain, leader, indirect tax, PwC. “This is mainly due to the 40% deemed credit and the loss that can happen to retailers and distributors due to the differential rates and (ambiguity on) who shall bear that.“ The new mantra for the retailers and wholesalers of consumer goods and automotive sectors seem to be `buy what you can sell till July 1'. The question is what would happen to goods which are lying with the retailers on July 1. In most cases, these products are subjected to a maximum retail price.The retailer will have to sell the products on the basis of the MRP -the Legal Metrology Act does not permit any alterations to that price -but pay an additional GST. He could face a loss if the rates under GST are higher than the existing rates. So, if a shopkeeper has a TV set in his showroom which was bought in May and on which taxes were already paid, when GST kicks in on July 1, he would be required to also collect GST on the product without altering its MRP. If the tax rate under GST on TV sets is higher than that under the current system, the difference would be referred for deemed credit. But since deemed credit is only available on 40% of CGST there could be some losses.Exactly the opposite could happen if tax rates on TV sets are less under GST. But traders aren't willing to gamble on that. There is also a view that the deemed credit of 40% CGST would be applicable when the seller can't produce bills of the various levies, such as the excise duty paid by the manufacturer, that reflected in the MRP . In such cases, he may have to absorb the remaining tax cost, though those who provide the documents would get full credit. “This makes it essential to focus on supply chain planning from now so that stock optimisation strategies at various distribution channels are planned and executed well in advance,“ said MS Mani, senior director, Deloitte Haskins & Sells.Traders want clarity on the implications. “The problem is that many retailers are worried. First, they are not sure about the rates and, secondly , they are not even well informed about GST,“ said Praveen Khandelwal, secretary-general, the Confederation of All India Traders. “Some retailers do not want to fall in the trap where they end up making losses although I think the government should come out more clearly and say that there would be no loss and there would be 100% tax credits on such tax losses.“ While different products would have different rates, some retailers and wholesalers fear that there could be a loss of 3.5% to 9% on taxes alone. Some of the retailers have already stopped dishing out discount schemes fearing this. ET had on April 10 reported that some of the biggest FMCG companies, including Hindustan Unilever and Procter & Gamble, have altered their manufacturing strategies with a hope of benefiting from GST. These companies have also changed prices of some of their products. J Suresh, chief executive at Arvind Lifestyle Brands, which sells international brands including Gap and Arrow, said the company isn't doing anything right now over GST. “First of all we don't know the rates yet. Second, the procedure is not known. Whatever action we may take now, that action has only 50% chance. So, we will not do anything,“ he said. ET VIEW: Make Clear Rules The onus lies on the Centre and states to ensure a smooth transition to the goods and services tax, which is the biggest indirect tax reform to create a unified market. Malaysia, which introduced GST two years ago, educated businesses and customers, but that did not suffice. India should be prepared better for the switch over to avoid any choas. So, rules must be clear, and the tax administration well-equipped to handle GST. Ideally, the new levy should be rolled out three months after the publication of GST rules to make transition smooth for businesses.

Trade “A readout of the calls sent out late last night by the White House narrows any chance that Trump will sign an executive order withdrawing from the deal, which was expected to happen Friday. It also signals a defeat for the economic nationalist faction of Trump’s advisory circle. Peter Navarro, the head of Trump’s National Trade Council, drafted the order in close cooperation with White House chief strategist Steve Bannon” [Politico]. “The White House readout also provided an indication that Trump will continue to follow the congressional consultation process as laid out by trade promotion authority legislation — a process Trump called ‘ridiculous’ last week. Trump and the other leaders agreed to ‘proceed swiftly, according to their required internal procedures, to enable the renegotiation of the NAFTA deal to the benefit of all three countries,’ the statement said.” “Proceed swiftly, according to their required internal procedures.” Is that like make haste, slowly? Politics Corruption Shot: “Obama’s $400,000 Wall Street Speech Is Completely In Character” [HuffPo]. Chaser: “Ask all the bankers he jailed for fraud.” Trump Transition “House Democrats will oppose a short-term spending bill if Republican leaders attempt to expedite an ObamaCare repeal bill this week, Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) warned Thursday” [The Hill]. “Hoyer, the Democratic whip, spoke with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) Thursday morning to warn him of the Democrats’ position. The threat is significant because GOP leaders will likely need Democratic votes to pass a short-term spending bill in the face of opposition from conservatives historically opposed to government funding bills.” Too funny. Ryan is so bad that even the Democrats can outmaneuver him. “We expect Congress to pass a week-long stop-gap government funding bill. That means a shutdown will be averted, giving the two parties time to iron out more details, but pushing this crisis into another week. That’s a bad sign for other legislative priorities. By the way: no money was included to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border” [Politico]. “If the House schedules a vote [on a new version of the AHCA] soon, it’s not going to have any analysis from the Congressional Budget Office to look at. So it won’t have any idea how many states might apply for waivers from the required benefits or the ban on charging higher rates to sick people, or how many people might be affected” [Axios]. 2016 Post Mortem “The Clinton Comedy of Errors” [Current Affairs]. A review of Shattered, well worth a read. This caught my eye: Shattered depicts a calamity of a campaign. While on the surface, Hillary Clinton’s team were far more unified and capable than their counterparts in 2008 had been, behind the scenes there was utter discord. The senior staff engaged in constant backstabbing and intrigue, jockeying for access to the candidate and selectively keeping information from one another. Clinton herself never made it exactly clear who had responsibility for what, meaning that staff were in a constant competition to take control. Worse, Clinton was so sealed off from her own campaign that many senior team members had only met her briefly, and interacted with her only when she held conference calls to berate them for their failures. Allen and Parnes call the situation “an unholy mess, fraught with tangled lines of authority, petty jealousies, distorted priorities, and no sense of general purpose,” in which “no one was in charge.” Of course, a Clinton administration would have been completely different. Realignment and Legitimacy “A fall 2015 Harvard poll of 18-29 year olds reported integrity, level-headedness and authenticity as the three most valued attributes in a presidential candidate—some of which can be easily signaled through swearing” [Politico]. Authenticity: If you can fake that, you’ve got it made. Hence Perez using “sh*t” profusely, as we pointed out Tuesday (with a bit of history on how that worked out the last time we tried it). I mean, come on. Bernie doesn’t have to effing cuss, right? Could there be a reason for that? “Are Trump voters ruining America for all of us?” [USA Today]. Apparently so: The fact of the matter is that too many Trump supporters do not hold the president responsible for his mistakes or erratic behavior because they are incapable of recognizing them as mistakes. They lack the foundational knowledge and basic political engagement required to know the difference between facts and errors, or even between truth and lies. And yet, without a hint of irony or even cognitive dissidence, in the preceding paragraph we have this: Possibly. A hard knot of Hillary Clinton’s supporters, for example — led by Clinton herself — refuse to accept that her defeat was anything less than a plot by the Russians or the FBI (or both). The idea that Clinton was an awful candidate who ran a terrible campaign is utterly alien to them. Assuming that the headline is a Betteridge’s Law violation, one can only conclude that Trump voters had plenty of help. I mean, is Putin Derangement Syndrome based on foundational knowledge? Does it show the capacity to distinguish between truth and lies? “The ‘deep state’ is President Trump’s most compelling conspiracy theory” [WaPo]. (The headline is lazy journalism; the term doesn’t originate with Trump.) Results from Post polling: I don’t have the time or (right now) the inclination to disentangle the Post’s new definition of the “deep state” from other definitions. (Basically, I’ve suggested that since we’re stuck with the term, we try to retrofit a degree of conceptual rigor onto it through developing patterns of usage, but its advocates seem curiously unwilling to take up the challenge.) At this point, the “deep state” is rather like Obama: “a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views.” That is, no doubt, why organs like WaPo find it so useful. “Though Trump’s agenda has unified Democrats in near-term opposition, clear fault lines have quickly emerged about the party’s long-term strategy to regain power. On one side are those—largely affiliated with Senator Bernie Sanders—arguing for a biting message of economic populism, which is intended largely to recapture working-class white voters that stampeded to Trump in 2016. On the other are party strategists who want Democrats to offer a more centrist economic message, aimed primarily at reassuring white-collar suburbanites drawn to the party mostly around cultural issues:” [Ronald Brownstein, The Atlantic]. No, Ron. Please sit down. And just try, try, for once in your life, to say “working class” without prepending “white.” In my language: “[U]niversal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class” are not intended to “recapture working-class white voters.” They are intended — after doing a lot of people a lot of good — to capture all working class voters, and to create a multigenerational left coalition of a New Deal-like scale and duration and power, instead of endlessly sintering together 50% plus one “coalitions” based on demographic verticals, as both liberals and conservatives have been doing, throughout their oscillations in office. That’s my story and I’m sticking to it. “The 22 Dems Supporting Sanders’ $15 Minimum Wage Bill… and 24 Who Aren’t” [Common Dreams]. Stats Watch Kansas City Fed Manufacturing Index, April 2017: “The pace of growth slowed in the Kansas City manufacturing sector from March’s unusually strong 20 to an April reading of 7” [Econoday]. “March was the strongest month for this report since early in the expansion, 6 years ago, which makes April’s numbers look weak by comparison.” And: “Kansas City Fed manufacturing has been one of the more stable districts and their index declined (similar to the other Fed districts). Key internals likewise were positive but declined” [Econintersect]. Durable Goods Orders, March 2017: “Aircraft lifted durable orders throughout the first quarter and made for a very solid 0.7 percent rise in March. But the story is different when excluding civilian aircraft as the ex-transportation reading fell 0.2 percent which is below Econoday’s low estimate” [Econoday]. “[C]ore capital goods (nondefense ex-aircraft) are soft.” And but: “This series has wide swings monthly so our primary metric is the three month rolling average which marginally improved. The real issue here is that inflation is starting to grab in this sector making real growth much less than appears at face value – and this month if we inflation adjust the rolling averages they decline. The trends on this series are indicating marginal economic improvement” [Econintersect]. “What should be concerning to analysts is the continuing contraction of backlog (unfilled orders) which have been contracting year-over-year since mid 2015.” And: “[T]here is no evidence of a significant increase in capital spending despite an underlying increase in business confidence” [Economic Calendar]. International Trade in Goods, March 2017: “Slightly narrower than expected” [Econoday]. “Exports fell 1.7 percent as both consumer goods and vehicles were down sharply. Lower oil prices during March also cut into exports, specifically industrial supplies which also fell sharply. Imports, likewise held down by lower oil prices, fell 0.7 percent but with consumer goods and capital goods, in inescapable signs of weak domestic demand, both down. Trade has not been a plus for the U.S. economy and the outlook for the rest of the year, given slow improvement in foreign markets and talk of trade wars, is guarded.” Pending Home Sales Index, March 2017: “Resales have been moving to expansion highs though moderate retracement is the outlook for April and perhaps even May” [Econoday]. “Though negative, today’s results are not a surprise for a housing sector that as a whole is entering the Spring selling season with strength.” But: “[R]olling averages marginally improved. Because there is so much noise in the monthly numbers the rolling averages are the best way to view the data” [Econintersect]. “I continue to see few signs that the residential sales market is improving.” Retail Inventories [Advance], March 2017: “Retail inventories rose 0.4 percent in March following a similar build in February. Much of the build may be unwanted given weakness in underlying retail sales” [Econoday]. “Inventory build is a positive for GDP but, against the backdrop of slow growth, is a likely negative for future production and employment.” Wholesale Inventories [Advance], March 2017: Edged lower and February revised down [Econoday]. “These results point to strong inventory management at the wholesale level but will be negatives for quarterly inventory change in tomorrow’s GDP report.” Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index, week of April 23, 2017: Very strong [Econoday]. “Strength in confidence readings ultimately points to strength in the jobs outlook.” Retail: “Overall purchases of consumer packaged goods in the U.S. declined 2.5% in unit terms in the first quarter… hitting results at companies including Procter & Gamble Co., PepsiCo Inc. and Nestlé SA. The results suggest that the sector is undergoing a deep structural shift: The 20 largest consumer packaged goods companies last year had flat sales while smaller ones posted sales growth of 2.4%, according to Nielsen” [WSJ]. Crapification? Cost-consciousness? Alexa? (“Alexa, order tissues” vs. “Alexa, order Kleenex™.”) Real Estate: “[The U.S. industrial property segment] vacancy rate hits 5.3 percent, 300 basis points below 10-year average” [DC Velocity]. “U.S. industrial demand has been spurred by the growth of e-commerce, which has led to the development of more and larger warehouses and distribution centers. A recent pickup in the global economy and international trade has provided a secondary boost.” Shipping: “Container port congestion in China is spreading up and down the coast as new liner alliance schedules added to poor weather cause disruption to container shipping operations” [Lloyd’s Loading List]. “Forwarding sources said another factor in the congestion was improved access to the port of Shanghai via the Yangtze River. The completion of river improvements along the Yangtze meant vessels from western parts of China such as Chongqing can reach Shanghai more easily, which has increased the number of ships, one forwarder told Lloyd’s Loading List.” Shipping: “[UPS] first-quarter operating profit slipped 2.4 percent in the U.S. package division even as revenue rose 5 percent from a year earlier, Atlanta-based UPS said in a statement Thursday. That signaled continued challenges in the company’s efforts to benefit from surging e-commerce, since home deliveries are less efficient than shipments to businesses” [Bloomberg]. The Bezzle: “Uber targets 2020 for on-demand VTOL demo flights in Dallas and Dubai” [TechCrunch]. If only there were an algorithm that could replace the stories planted by public relations firms with blank space, or soothing music, or beautiful pictures of plants or animals… The Bezzle: “Juno always had the best sales pitch. The company started in New York in early 2016, a late entrant to the competitive ride-hailing business, but quickly made a name for itself by promising to be nicer to drivers. Juno pledged to keep its commission low, at 10% of a fare, and to operate a round-the-clock support center. It also told drivers that, by working enough hours, they could earn Juno stock from a special program, and share in the company’s long-term success” [Quartz]. Wait for it… “The agreement [Juno driver Steven Savader] signed does give Juno the option to pay him in cash instead of in shares. However, the numbers emailed to him today, and to a driver contacted by the New York Observer, suggest that Juno has priced the shares at less than 2 cents apiece. That’s not even a tenth of the $0.20 share price Juno advertised to drivers in recruiting materials last summer. Two other contracts seen by Quartz offered $100 payments for 1,604 and 3,580 shares respectively, or 2.8 cents and 6.2 cents per share, suggesting that there may have been a minimum payment of $100.” Read the whole thing, it’s just as slimy as you would expect. The Bezzle: “The $30bn sex tech industry is about to unveil its biggest blockbuster: a $15,000 robot companion that talks, learns, and never says no” [Guardian]. Public Relations: “United Airlines just announced 10 major changes to avoid another violent passenger-removal incident” [Business Insider]. This doesn’t look so bad, I have to say. Airline experts? Honey for the Bears: “Throughout San Francisco and Silicon Valley, cash-rich technology firms have built or are erecting bold, futuristic headquarters that convey their brands to employees and customers” [The Economist]. See Parkinson’s Law, chapter 6: It is now known that a perfection of planned layout is achieved only by institutions on the point of collapse…. [P]erfection of planning is a symptom of decay. During a period of exciting discovery or progress there is no time to plan the perfect headquarters. The time for that comes later, when all the important work has been done. Perfection, we know, is finality; and finality is death. Today’s Fear & Greed Index: 48 Neutral (previous close: 46, Neutral) [CNN]. One week ago: 34 (Fear).

This is rich, given that Ebony isn’t paying its (black) writers the money it owes them. “Blunt Talk: The Racist Origins of Pot Prohibition” [Rolling Stone]. “At first, back in the late 19th Century, academic and medical conversations about the dangers of inebriation included every popular mood-altering substance: cocaine and opium, yes, but also alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and tea. But in the next 50 years, concerns about inebriation only translated into law if the substance wasn’t already controlled by a powerful industry, and if there was a perception, accurate or not, that a given drug was being used by poor people, immigrants, and people of color.” Class Warfare The flood of inequality charts isn’t slowing: Income gains going to top 1% in 1954-7: 5% 1975-9: 25% 2009-12: 95%https://t.co/qJ7ZBYmd9O pic.twitter.com/ZmBQucq8TA &mdash; Conrad Hackett (@conradhackett) April 27, 2017 Another: CHART | Income #inequality in the US increased almost continuously from the late &#39;70s until 2013 https://t.co/QJqbxT4vAS pic.twitter.com/eC3jAQvC8g &mdash; Bruegel (@Bruegel_org) April 27, 2017 “Noticed today that there’s some new hostile architecture in Lamont Park: wooden dividers installed on all the benches so folks can’t lie down.

What’s more, low-income borrowers appeared to be most sensitive to the change in home prices, probably because they faced the largest earning plunges, had the smallest savings cushions, and, as a result, may not have been able to continue repaying their loans.” “Boeing Co. could bring more work in-house as part of an effort to reduce the cost of building jetliners that also includes introducing more automation and job cuts” [Wall Street Journal].

Donate $25$50$75$100 00600 This entry was posted in Guest Post, Water Cooler on April 27, 2017 by Lambert Strether. About Lambert Strether Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

Reply ↓ Adam Eran April 28, 2017 at 11:11 pm Sorry, that just empowers unelected staff (and doesn’t work, as California’s experience demonstrates). Personally, I think there’s a racist element to the term limit talk in California. Willy Brown ran the Assembly and was undefeat-able. I doubt there’s a really good answer to this problem, but term limits has functioned so poorly that legislators now have to quit by the time they’ve learned their jobs, and how to spot the con men amongst lobbyists.

Physics prevents single payer health care….dark energy, dark matter, dark, dark, money….. Until a strong majority of dems are ready to say what is patently obvious to anyone even mildly willing to acknowledge reality, i.e., that policy is decided not by a majority of voters, but by a majority of dollars, than there is simply no hope for reform.

Still another reason to be antiwar. Cantor Fitzgerald loses 700 people, and Syria now has something like 11 million displaced people / refugees. And who even bothers to count the Iraqi dead? That’s so 2002-ish. Obama isn’t just showing that he is a creature of the banks.

The opponents already have studies from the single payer Schwarzenegger vetoed, and from Vermont demonstrating it’s too expensive in California. Not asked in the hearing: 1.

Goldman, Citi, et al. knew who they were getting. Besides, Obama was kind of on his rookie contract. The idea is that he needs to do his very, very best for them for eight years, and then they’ll pay him what they think he deserves. That way, he continues to push himself to do better and better, in the hopes of an even better reward when he’s done. One nice thing about the fee being announced like this is that we can all see how much his efforts were valued by his masters. I wonder what he’d have gotten if he’d pushed TPP over the finish line.

An airline attendant could and may have considered that a security issue and still call in the wild dogs in that event. Hopefully the training will address that specifically. I do know CEOs do not like not being in control. Once the police get involved United is no longer in control and that bit them, so motivations seem reasonable to institute calling security as a very very last resort going forward via policy and training.

I think it is also one of those words that has different meanings depending on who speaks it like, for example, queer. Said by a LGBTQer it is a mark of pride. Said by some ignorant redneck it’s an insult. Conspiracy theory said by intelligence people or the media means your current theory is on the right track. Said by average Americans it means “I don’t want to think critically about this so I’ll use the government term for crazy.” I’ve also been thinking: what about Dark State instead of Deep State? Gets away from the Turkey connotations and the terms feels more appropriate to the secretive malevolence generated by said body.

Reply ↓ DJG April 27, 2017 at 4:22 pm j84austin points to the main cause: In the 2010 census, unlike New York proper and Los Angeles proper, both of which gained population. Chicago dropped from about 2.9 million to 2.7 million, or 10 percent. The main drop has been in the black population. Black people are fleeing. It is indeed part of the general atmosphere of looting the school system, privatizing public assets like street parking, and raising various use / excise taxes along with property taxes. The job market isn’t bad: With the usual conditions. Chicago now draws lots of young college graduates who want to work in edgy, disruptive companies like the fabled Groupon. And for anyone who has lived for a long time in Illinois there also comes a moment when you realize that you can’t take another winter. Much of the rest of Illinois is still losing population. I ran across a reference recently to a town, Savanna, in the Mississippi Valley, that has managed to lose quite a bit of its population in the last 20 years. A shame: Savanna is a scenic town, poised on a bluff, one of those “picture postcard” places (and there are more in Illinois than one would suspect given its tough-guy image). Savanna, not so coincidentally, is in the part of the upper Mississippi Valley that Clinton could not capture, even though Obama had. Reply ↓ Huey Long April 27, 2017 at 5:51 pm I’m not surprised the black population of Chicago is running for the hills considering the 4300+ shootings and 750+ murders that occurred there last year, primarily in black neighborhoods. I also wouldn’t be surprised if they end up moving back to places like the Mississippi Delta, where most of these people have roots and relatives they see periodically at family reunions. Blacks in Chicago are a relatively recent phenomenon, dating back to the 1940’s-1960’s when labor was needed in Chicago and herbicides/mechanization displaced lots of farm workers in the delta. Chicago was a natural destination due to the layout of the railroads in the area. The Promised Land: The Great Black Migration and How It Changed America by Nicholas Lemann is a great book on this phenomenon and I highly recommend it.

Maybe I’m from Canada so I will struggle to empathize with this one, but from what I can tell all of the Great Lakes areas have very mild winters. My other question is how can people who have lived there for years, decades, or even generations suddenly decide they cannot take another winter?

Reply ↓ JustAnObserver April 27, 2017 at 3:11 pm Very roughly its this: Your internet performance – data rate, packet delay, packet error rate, etc. – is independent of the site you’re visiting (*). It’s important that this is a measure of the *internet* itself and not that of the web server that’s responding to your request. (*) More exactly: At each “hop” as the packets get moved by the internet routers the hop delay should be independent of the source & destination IP addresses. The ISPs are not allowed to e.g. bandwidth throttle a connection dependent on whether the destination IP is Google, MS’ft, Apple, etc. Or, more perniciously, choose a different route with more hops or slower and/or more congested connections Reply ↓ Goyo Marquez April 27, 2017 at 3:28 pm Net neutrality, AIUI, means not turning the internet into cable T.V., where you must “pay” for each channel that you want to watch.

Unless you or the website want to pay a premium for decent service. Basically it’s just more neoliberal rent seeking, charging you a premium on top of what you’re already paying for. Reply ↓ Vatch April 27, 2017 at 4:20 pm This isn’t an answer to your question, which has probably already been adequately answered by at least three people. Ajit Pai, the principal opponent of net neutrality on the FCC, is engaging in a form of McCarthyism, which implies that his case is weak: http://fortune.com/2017/04/27/fcc-mccarthyism-net-neutrality/ From Ajit Pai’s speech: Consider, for example, the leading special interest in favor of Title II: a spectacularly misnamed Beltway lobbying group called Free Press. Its co-founder and current board member makes no effort to hide the group’s true agenda. While he says “we’re not at th[e] point yet” where we can “completely eliminate the telephone and cable companies,” he admits that “the ultimate goal is to get rid of the media capitalists in the phone and cable companies and to divest them from control.” And who would assume control of the Internet? The government, of course. The overall goal is to “remove brick by brick the capitalist system itself, rebuilding the entire society on socialist principles.“ Socialism! If we don’t get rid of net neutrality, we’ll have Socialism! He neglects to mention that we currently have net neutrality, and our ALEC and Koch Brothers dominated system of government is about as far removed from socialism as is possible. The author of the article picks apart Pai’s ludicrous argument in several paragraphs.

Most of the demand for bandwidth comes from a small slice of the users. However there is no reason that non-streaming websites, or those with low bandwidth demand should be discriminated against. There has to be a way to protect the small providers while also making the large providers pay their infrastructure costs.

This is a common misconception. Netflix pays for every byte that it uses. You pay for every byte that you use. What the abolishment of net neutrality does is it allows the ISP’s to say “That’s a nice business you got there, be a shame if we were to throttle it”. Netflix would have to pay for the ISP’s to do nothing to their bytes.

Reply ↓ redleg April 27, 2017 at 10:43 pm The solution to that is to add a licensing fee to every data plan which then gets paid out to the performers and publishers where it gets distributed. This would make sharing legal as long as a performer/writer/distributor agrees to the payment scheme (some money is usually better than none). This is how it works with TV and satellite radio. The fees are not collected on volume of use, just an simple access/license charge and the total is divided up.

Short, short version: the Deep State is the set of people (government officials, mostly) who wield some amount of power but whose positions are not affected by election results. Nothing particularly secret about it. Reply ↓ justanotherprogressive April 27, 2017 at 3:21 pm As a former government employee, I’m trying to figure out who “the set of people (government officials, mostly) who wield some amount of power but whose positions are not affected by election results” are. I hear about them all the time, particularly on right wing blogs, but I’ve never actually seen one…… The power in a government agency is held by political appointees (“politicos” in guvspeak) and those political appointees are the only ones that speak for or direct the agency. And they change every time there is a change in the Presidency. Most agencies have more than one political appointee. My last job was with a small agency (less than two hundred employees) that had five. If a senior staff member is not immediately in line with the politicos’ policies, that person is removed (demoted, sidelined, or transferred to another agency). Those governmental employees that stay year after year (the “weebees”) just do the work, they have no power, and they definitely cannot make any decisions for the agency. Reply ↓ Vatch April 27, 2017 at 3:34 pm In some government agencies, the high ranking career employees seem to be rather good at manipulating the political appointees. This does not apply to all agencies; the primary examples are in the military, intelligence, financial, and justice realms. Unsurprisingly, these are the agencies that are the heaviest users of secrecy. There’s also a lot of cross pollination between portions of the private sector (completely unelected, of course), and the murky deep state. Some of this involves the “revolving door”, but some is just shadowy cooperation, such as we see among the NSA and various giants in telecommunications and Silicon Valley, or among Wall Street, the Treasury Department, and the Federal Reserve. The public does not elect those people. Reply ↓ justanotherprogressive April 27, 2017 at 4:13 pm I don’t think there is much “manipulation” needed. After all the politicos come from the lobby/contractor/donor class, whether they be Democrat or Republican and they are already unwilling to change anything that they perceive as giving them power and control….. But I guess it is easier to believe in a “Deep State” than realize that those shiny new politicians we just elected really do not want to change anything…… Reply ↓ Vatch April 27, 2017 at 5:21 pm Some of us believe that there is both a deep state and that there are elected politicians who wish to preserve the status quo. Reply ↓ likbez April 27, 2017 at 10:07 pm When weI say “deep state” we typically understand this term as “intelligence agencies”; we say “intelligence agencies” and mean “deep state”. From Wikispooks ( https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Deep_state ): “The phrase “deep state” derives from the Turkish “derin devlet”, which emerged after the 1996 Susurluk incident so dramatically unmasked the Turkish deep state. It has experienced a surge of use in 2017, though often not in keeping with the meaning attributed by the diplomat who coined the phrase. …As powerful and self-interest groups (probably even more dominated by psychopaths and sociopaths than other large hierarchies), deep states seek to frustrate radical and progressive change, so as to preserve their own power, and that of the establishment in general. In contrast to overtly authoritarian rule, deep states must operate more or less secretly, like terrorist groups, so preserving secrecy is a high priority. Control of the commercially-controlled media is essential to the effective preservation of secrecy need for the deep state to work effectively. In the US this is effected through deep state control of the CIA. With the apparatus of nation states under their control, their subterfuges can be elaborate and complex. The deep states of the world have a natural common interest in hiding their existence, which predisposes them to mutual assistance. As a Turkish cartoon put it in 1997 “Deep state protects its own.”[5] ” I think the term “deep state” is closely connected with the notion of “national security state” and by extension with the term “military industrial complex”. And the core of deep state are always intelligence agencies which tend to escape the control of the governments and in turn attempt to control the government that should control them. There are certain requirement for such agencies that very few agencies outside intelligence agencies meet. 1. Institualized ability to collect dirt of politicians, or access to such information collected by other agencies. 2. The veil of secrecy over the actions and funding. Access to some “non-controlled” or “semi-controlled” funding for “special operations” and “actions” 3. Set of people trained for conducting covert operations, especially false flag operations. 4. Experience with covert operations abroad that can be transferred to the “home territory” in case of necessity. Peter Dale Scott refers in a recent essay to “A Supranational Deep State”, noting how their international integration effectively allows intelligence agencies to evade even the limited control national governments had on them in the first half of the 20th century. 5. Infiltrated, or at lease “influencable” on the level of “useful contacts” with publishers and top journalists media. Deep state generally controls corporate media as Church commission established long ago. Any agency that meets whose three criteria is “by definition” belongs to deep state. That means that outside Pentagon and three letter agencies only State Department (which now performs a part of functions of CIA as for color revolutions preparation) and Energy Department can qualify. Reply ↓ hunkerdown April 27, 2017 at 6:22 pm Try Charles Hugh Smith‘s working definition: The Deep State is fundamentally the public-private centralized nodes that collect, archive and curate dominant narratives and their supporting evidence, and disseminate these narratives (and their implicit teleologies) to the public via the media and to the state agencies via formal and informal inter-departmental communication channels. In other words, the people who, in the public mind, define and legitimize (or delegitimize) the agenda and the members and objectives of the ideal power structure you describe, which, contrary to almost any anecdotal observation of office politics in general, seems to contain no dotted lines, no stovepipes, perfect subordination, no split allegiances or conflicting interests, and no other indirect pressures from within or without. Sounds more liberal than progressive, tbh. Reply ↓ Aumua April 28, 2017 at 12:21 am The Deep State is a great phrase that very succinctly sums up a lot of angles, for me. The State has reached its expiration date, but it doesn’t want to go just yet, so it’s digging in Deep. It’s hunkered down. It’s grabbing and holding on as close to the roots of society, biology and planet as it can, and it’s going to take some doing to rip it out, cause it’s not going to let go by itself.

Reply ↓ Huey Long April 27, 2017 at 3:21 pm It is now known that a perfection of planned layout is achieved only by institutions on the point of collapse…. [P]erfection of planning is a symptom of decay. During a period of exciting discovery or progress there is no time to plan the perfect headquarters. The time for that comes later, when all the important work has been done. Perfection, we know, is finality; and finality is death. Following this line of reasoning, it seems to me that the US military establishment has been in decline ever since the Pentagon was built and the temporary Navy Dept. buildings erected on the National Mall were razed. Being that the Pentagon opened in 1943 and the buildings on the Mall were razed in 1970, which roughly coincides with our costly imperial adventures in Korea and Vietnam, I think Parkinson’s Law #6 is dead on here.

They are: Reply ↓ grayslady April 27, 2017 at 8:03 pm Actually, Patty Murray introduced the bill on April 30, 2015, which would have raised the minimum wage gradually to $12 by 2020. There were 32 original co-sponsors, all Dems. Bernie introduced a similar bill on July 22, 2015, with Ed Markey as the original co-sponsor, which would have raised the minimum wage to $15 dollars by 2020. Members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus introduced a companion bill in the House. The most recent bill is a re-introduction of Murray’s bill, with Sanders now supporting $15 by 2024. I know that many here continue to wish to believe that Sanders hasn’t sold out to the Dems, but the evidence becomes clearer that he is no longer the fighter he was when he ran for President.

Reply ↓ DJG April 27, 2017 at 4:49 pm fascinating: The defects that are Clinton-specific (or, at least, not fundamental to contemporary Democratic politics) are managerial incompetence and Nixonian levels of cronyism and paranoia. Clinton was obsessed with loyalty, “prizing [it] most among human traits” (above, e.g., virtue). She had downloaded and rooted through the emails of all her 2008 campaign staff to determine who had screwed her, and tried to sniff out “acts of betrayal.” She even assigned “loyalty scores” to various members of Congress, “from one for the most loyal to seven for those who had committed the most egregious acts of treachery.” Reply ↓ marku52 April 27, 2017 at 5:43 pm That Current Affairs article is great from one end to the other. It was so good I subscribed to the print edition. Reply ↓ Altandmain April 27, 2017 at 7:44 pm Nathan Robinson, the Editor of Current Affairs writes pretty good articles. Here’s another: https://static.currentaffairs.org/2016/02/unless-the-democrats-nominate-sanders-a-trump-nomination-means-a-trump-presidency Here, a Clinton match-up is highly likely to be an unmitigated electoral disaster, whereas a Sanders candidacy stands a far better chance. Every one of Clinton’s (considerable) weaknesses plays to every one of Trump’s strengths, whereas every one of Trump’s (few) weaknesses plays to every one of Sanders’s strengths. From a purely pragmatic standpoint, running Clinton against Trump is a disastrous, suicidal proposition. … Every Democrat should take some time to fairly, dispassionately examine Clinton’s track record as a campaigner. Study how the ‘08 campaign was handled, and how this one has gone. Assess her strengths and weaknesses with as little bias or prejudice as possible. Then picture the race against Trump, and think about how it will unfold. It’s easy to see that Trump has every single advantage. Because the Republican primary will be over, he can come at her from both right and left as he pleases. As the candidate who thundered against the Iraq War at the Republican debate, he can taunt Clinton over her support for it. He will paint her as a member of the corrupt political establishment, and will even offer proof: “Well, I know you can buy politicians, because I bought Senator Clinton. I gave her money, she came to my wedding.” He can make it appear that Hillary Clinton can be bought, that he can’t, and that he is in charge. It’s also hard to defend against, because it appears to be partly true. Any denial looks like a lie, thus making Hillary’s situation look even worse. And then, when she stumbles, he will mock her as incompetent. Note that this was published in February 2016.

To improve its power and make RADAR small enough to install in aircraft the Brits also invented the cavity magnetron in early 1940 but didn’’t have the large-scale manufacturing capability to mass-produce it. So in 1940 a mission led by Henry Tizard secretly brought the magnetron to the United States and persuaded the US to help develop and produce the device. The MIT Radiation Laboratory was set up and quickly became one of the largest wartime projects, employing about 4000 people. Researchers and workers there made mass-production versions of the magnetron and developed about 100 different radar systems, and the US then and afterwards generally cashed in on British ingenuity handed to them for free.

These are just some of the findings of a new study released today by Peak Sales Recruiting.

The split with the highest satisfaction (36%) is 60% base and 40% commission. The split with the lowest satisfaction is 0% base and 100% commission. Compensation plans with uncapped commissions were correlated with higher levels of satisfaction (33%) versus capped commissions (14%).

Photographer: Mustafa Yalcin/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images The La Rotonde brasserie in Paris has a storied past as a haunt for the likes of Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Picasso, and Trotsky. This spring it’s back in the news for a different kind of guest: Emmanuel Macron, who took his entourage to La Rotonde after winning the first round of the presidential election on April 23. The celebration and triumphant victory speech that preceded it struck many as premature, given that the 39-year-old political neophyte must still face Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front in a runoff on May 7. The press criticized Macron as tone-deaf, #larotonde became a Twitter meme, and Le Pen pounced on the event as proof that Macron was an “elite Parisian” out of touch with traditional values. “Macron could find nothing better to do than to celebrate?” asks Thomas Guénolé, a professor of politics at the Sciences Po institute in Paris. “He needed to show himself as a statesman, and instead he comes across as a child king.” The misstep is highly unlikely to cost Macron the presidency, because polls show him beating Le Pen by at least 20 percentage points. The greater risk is that it will tarnish his image with a divided electorate and weaken his hand in parliamentary elections in June. Former President Nicolas Sarkozy was dogged by fallout from a 2007 election night dinner at a glitzy restaurant on the Champs-Élysées that helped earn him the nickname “President Bling-Bling.” And while Sarkozy had a ready-made majority in Parliament, Macron’s En Marche! (On the Move!) party was formed only a year ago and has no deputies. En Marche plans to field candidates in every district, but it’s unlikely to secure the 289 lower-house seats needed for a majority to enact Macron’s legislative program of wide-ranging labor reforms and lower corporate and payroll taxes. If he’s seen as politically clumsy, he’ll have trouble wooing members of the center-right Republicans and center-left Socialists to back any eventual coalition government. After the first round, Macron “lacked gravitas, he looked too satisfied,” Socialist Party head Jean-Christophe Cambadélis, who’s endorsed Macron, said on RTL radio on April 25. The National Front holds only two seats in the lower house, but it’s likely to win more in June. Le Pen got almost 22 percent of the vote on April 23, up from the 2012 election, when she placed third in the initial round with 17 percent. Stubbornly high unemployment and a series of deadly terror attacks have strengthened her hand in some traditionally leftist regions, and her lifetime of political experience—her father founded the National Front—may give her a tactical edge over Macron. He’s known as a whiz kid who excelled at top schools and worked as an investment banker before serving as economy minister under Socialist President François Hollande, but he’s never been elected to political office. Another risk is meddling by hackers. Macron’s campaign has been targeted by cyberattacks similar to those used to infiltrate the Democratic National Committee in Washington last year, according to Trend Micro Inc. The cybersecurity consultant said the hackers used a technique known as spearphishing, sending emails appearing to come from Macron’s official website, with attachments that would install spyware if opened. En Marche has confirmed five such attacks since January, but says no campaign data was compromised, and it says staffers generally communicate via encrypted messaging systems rather than email. Le Pen was quick to display her street-fighting skills after Macron’s election night dinner, touring downtrodden areas of northern France to bolster her image as a woman of the people. “This is obviously not La Rotonde,” she said at a market in Rouvroy, a town where she gathered almost 43 percent of the vote. On April 26, she made an unannounced stop at a Whirlpool Corp. plant in Macron’s hometown, Amiens, shortly before he was scheduled to visit. When he arrived, he was greeted by a hostile crowd. The factory is slated to lose 280 jobs as production shifts to Poland—evidence, Le Pen said, that Macron is selling out French workers by supporting “savage globalization.” Macron contends France can benefit from international trade if the government helps companies respond to competition and provides better education and training to workers. “Le Pen’s project will fix nothing of the Whirlpool problem,” he told reporters in Amiens, noting that a local Procter & Gamble Co. plant exports 90 percent of its output.

Sign Up If Macron prevails, the Republicans and Socialists may not be eager to back his government, says Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations in Brussels. While presidential candidates from both parties were knocked out in the first round and asked their supporters to vote for Macron, their deputies in Parliament may be reluctant to work with him for fear of strengthening his nascent party. Undermining Macron, though, would probably do more to help Le Pen than either of the traditional parties—and Leonard says it could bolster an eventual presidential bid in 2022 by Le Pen. “It’s a choice between death by asphyxiation or by drowning,” he says. “In the end I suspect some will peel off to join Macron and others will oppose him.” —With Helene Fouquet and Mark Deen The bottom line: Even if he beats Le Pen on May 7, Macron may have trouble finding support in Parliament for his agenda.
