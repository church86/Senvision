Trian has been increasing its stake in the household products giant. Monday, 5 Jun 2017 | 11:21 AM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters P&G CEO David Taylor: We listen to ideas from shareholders    Monday, 5 Jun 2017 | 10:43 AM ET | 04:04 Procter & Gamble is in "ongoing constructive, active" talks with Trian Fund Management about the future of its brands, P&G Chief David Taylor told CNBC. "We are willing to engage. We want to be better," Taylor said. He added that he is willing to take ideas from the hedge fund about how to improve its business as it does from other stakeholders. CNBC reported in February that Trian had acquired a $3.5 billion stake in the multinational consumer goods maker. In May, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that the fund reported it held 36.17 million P&G shares, six times that of the prior quarter. P&G recently made an effort to focus on its core products, like Gillette razors, and shed unprofitable brands after it struggled to boost top-line growth. Taylor told CNBC the company is moving ahead on sharpening its focus on 10 categories, including its laundry care and shaving businesses, and empowering its brand presidents to make decisions and operate independently. These decisions encompass everything from how much to invest in research and development to which markets to enter. The P&G chief told CNBC the company continues to work on its plan to shave $10 billion in costs through productivity improvements, including reducing overhead costs and the costs of goods sold, marketing and media buying. As for questions about whether P&G should break up into smaller companies, Taylor said that the scale of the company helps it in a variety of ways. Trian was founded in 2005 by Nelson Peltz, Peter May and Ed Garden and it seeks to invest in high-quality but undervalued and underperforming public companies. —Reporting by Sara Eisen.

Photographer: Ulrich Baumgarten/Getty Images Google, which controls more than 40 percent of the U.S. digital ad market, has decided to teach the world which ads are acceptable and which aren't. Starting next year, its Chrome web browser will block all ads -- including those bought through Google -- on websites that don't follow guidelines set by an industry group. This monopolistic move is meant to save the digital ad industry from itself. It would also have the side effects of making Google's business model more sustainable. Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google's senior vice president for ads and commerce, delivered the warning to website owners in a recent blog post. Chrome, he wrote, won't show any advertising on sites that try to run ads that are designated as annoying by the Coalition for Better Ads, a group that, apart from Google, includes the second digital ad powerhouse -- Facebook, as well as content creators such as News Corp. and The Washington Post and major advertisers such as Procter & Gamble. The group has researched user experiences and concluded that internet users hate pop-up ads, self-launching videos with sound, countdown ads that make one wait before a page loads, and large sticky ads that don't go away as you scroll. Google is not the first browser maker to build in ad blocking functionality. Last year, Norway-based Opera Software did so, saying it wanted to motivate the industry to stop annoying viewers and increasing website load times. Like Google, Opera also declared it supported lighter ad formats, but didn't pick and choose websites on which to filter out advertising. Now, about a third of Opera users have turned on the blocking feature. But there are too few of them to count: Opera commands a 3.5 percent global market share. Chrome, with 54 percent, dwarfs all other players, and its threat to stop showing ads on certain sites is essentially an order to change or die.  It's not a nice move. Many will see it as a power grab aimed at weakening other players, who are already losing share to Google and Facebook. Content creators could point out that the two giants sell some of the most irritating ad formats, but the Coalition for Better Ads has no problem with them. Instead, it's helping Google wage war on the formats that bring in the most revenue for publishers. So why would Google expose itself to new accusations of abusing its monopoly position, especially given that its business keeps growing and so does the global digital ad market, which is expected to reach $223.7 billion this year and continue to make double-digit leaps until at least 2020? Google founders and executives have built such a powerful company because they've never allowed themselves to get stuck in the present or the near future. And the medium term looks troubling for the digital ad industry because of the quickly growing use of ad blockers. On desktop computers, the use of such software is increasing while web traffic from them is going down. But that's not what should worry Google, whose strategy is based on mobile dominance; on mobile devices, the use of ad blockers is rocketing. In 2016, Google's ad sales increased about 18 percent. The number of mobile devices that use an ad blocker grew 38 percent (to 380 million), according to PageFair. Much of that growth is in Asia, one of the most promising regions for advertisers. Increasingly, Google and other companies exploiting advertising-based business models are facing a world in which ads are sold, providing a robust revenue stream, but people find ways to opt out of looking at them. That gives fraud -- primarily the practice of "showing" ads to bots rather than real people -- an increasing weight in the industry's total revenues. Google needs to get real people to keep looking at ads, and it appears to believe that making other people's ads less intrusive is the way toward that goal. I doubt it's going to solve the problem, mainly because the guidelines are written in a way that ensures that viewers will continue to see annoying ads from Google and Facebook -- if not from many other sites. Clear thinking from leading voices in business, economics, politics, foreign affairs, culture, and more. Share the View Sign Up Google appears to believe that the digital ad market's fundamental contradiction between people's desire for free content and their annoyance with ads is a matter of balance. That belief is apparently shared by some content producers: A few of them have signed up for Google's relaunched Contributor program, which allows sites to charge a small fee -- usually $0.01 per page -- to show a visitor no ads at all. But the program did badly before the relaunch, and very few content sites have signed up for it now. To most readers, paying to see no ads is essentially like paying protection money -- something to be avoided with the help of a comprehensive ad blocker, not a pro-Google, pro-Facebook one.  Content creators, like any other manufacturers, are on shaky ground when people can consume their product free of charge. A strong paid subscription base is the only good insurance against a future digital advertising crisis, which Google is trying to stave off with its attempt to join a trend it can't beat.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

He is not a chef or restaurant manager, but a food scientist. (Courtesy | Tom Ryan) Print Email Shandra Martinez | smartinez@mlive.com By Shandra Martinez | smartinez@mlive.com The Grand Rapids Press on June 05, 2017 at 8:30 AM, updated June 06, 2017 at 1:45 PM comments   GRAND RAPIDS, MI -- McDonald's dollar menu, Pizza Hut's stuffed crust pizza and Smashburger were all dreamed up by Grand Rapids native Tom Ryan. The restaurant guru will make a rare visit to his hometown this week to speak at a ACG Western Michigan event about his business successes and struggles. Ryan says he has purposefully built his career around products that connect with a large number of people. "I think to be creative over decades requires you to have an eye for all things modern and to inspire," said Ryan, who grew up on Grand Rapids' West Side.  The Smashburger CEO isn't your typical restaurateur. He isn't a chef or restaurant manager, but a food scientist. He earned a bachelor's, master's and doctorate degrees in flavor and fragrance chemistry from Michigan State University. During his doctoral studies, he became intrigued with marketing and consumer research, which set him on his career path. When he graduated from West Catholic High School in 1975, Ryan headed to MSU on a pre-med track before realizing he wasn't a good fit to be a doctor. It wasn't a profession that offered him enough creativity or team work. Trying to figure out a way to avoid an extra year in college from switching majors, he discovered food science classes while thumbing through the curriculum book. "I just excelled in all of it," he said of his food sciences classes. He began his career in development positions at Proctor & Gamble and Pillsbury, where he recognized the power of combining strong technical knowledge with consumer insights. Ryan says he spent hours chasing and evaluating restaurant trends, searching for the next "big idea" to bring to grocery shelves. Along the way, he fell in love with restaurants, menu innovations, and the creativity he saw in the emerging restaurant landscape and moved in that direction. He joined Pizza Hut in the late 1980's and quickly brought his first round of successful products to the marketplace. Ryan and his team launched the Lover's Line, Breadsticks and Chicken Wings, Sicilian Pizza and Stuffed Crust Pizza. A decade later, Ryan hopped over to McDonald's, where he moved up the ranks from menu development to chief marketing office to worldwide chief concept officer. During his seven years at the fast food giant, Ryan introduced McFlurries, The Dollar Menu, and McGriddles to the marketplace. By 2003, Ryan partnered with Rick Schaden in Denver to focus on new concepts. He joined the Quiznos team as chief branding officer, adding Steakhouse Beef Dip and the Prime Rib Sub to the menu. In 2007, the partners launched Smashburger, what they called the burger joint for the next generation. The 10-year-old chain now has more than 380 locations in 38 states and 9 countries. More than 220 are owned and operated by Smashburger, and the rest are franchised -- including the two locations in Grand Rapids.  The Denver-based chain has been named twice by Forbes as "Americas Most Promising Company," has won countless local awards for best burgers, and earned Ryan a spot on Gourmet Magazine's "25 Top Food Entrepreneurs of the Last 25 Years" list. In 2012, the partners opened Tom's Urban, a sports bar for the next generation and in 2013, Tom's Live Basil Pizza, a pizza parlor for the next generation. The partners have also created a private equity firm that invests in their restaurant ventures. Ryan is speaking to the business group at the request of a childhood friend. The visit will give him some time to spend with his dad, too. While here, Ryan plans to tour some restaurants. "With my schedule, I don't make it back to Grand Rapids often," he said. "I'm excited to be back there." He's impressed with Grand Rapids' evolution in the four decades since he moved away. "When I graduated, I was ready to go someplace else bigger, some place more dynamic, someplace with things going on," Ryan said. "To be perfectly honest with you, that wasn't Grand Rapids in 1975." He's a big fan of Founders Brewing Co., Martha's Vineyard and the Downtown Market. "The whole resurgence of downtown, whether it's the hotel scene, the restaurant scene, the bar scene, it's now a source of pride, instead of not," Ryan said. "All that is really, really cool stuff to be happening in Grand Rapids." His siblings, who now live in the Chicago area, would love to come back, he said. Ryan lives with his wife Jody in Denver and Minneapolis. They have three grown children. The ACG Western Michigan's first-ever "Hometown Hero" Breakfast, at 7:30 a.m. June 8 at Thousand Oaks Country Club, is free to members and $40 for non-members. The business trade association regularly features thought-provoking speakers who speak directly to the concerns of high-growth and midsize businesses.

Submit news Admap Prize 2017 winners announced 5 Jun 2017 | Save | Email | Print |  PDF    Issued by: Kantar TNS How should TV and social media be used to maximum effect? Kyle Findlay of Kantar TNS South Africa wins silver for his paper, “Four tips for using TV with social” Kyle FindlayThe winners of WARC’s annual global Admap Prize 2017, an essay contest that encourages and rewards individual excellence in strategic thinking in brand communications, are revealed. Based on the topic ‘How Should TV and Social Media Be Used to Maximum Effect?’ entrants were asked to address the current re-evaluation by many brands on how traditional media and new media fit together in the marketing landscape. Colin Grimshaw, editor of Admap, organiser of the prize says: “We are delighted with the response to this year’s Admap contest, now in its sixth year. We were impressed by the volume and quality of the essays submitted based on the topic motivated by P&G’s famous declaration last year of an about-face in its marketing strategy, which has prompted many brands into re-thinking their ad budgets.” Mandy Pooler, chief marketing officer for Kantar, sponsor of the Admap Prize, comments: “It is established that multichannel campaigns are more effective than single-channel, yet how brands marry TV and social continues to be a challenge. Knowledge of exactly how people consume media and subsequently act is key to the solution.” Judged by a panel of the industry’s foremost thought leaders, seven winning authors were selected offering widely different solutions. Commenting on this year’s essays, judge Gemma Craven, SVP, Director Social & Mobile of McCann New York says: “The Admap Prize topic is one of the primary challenges facing our industry today. The essays were thought-provoking, diverse and very well researched. There were different opinions on how TV and social should work together, but the clear message was that we spend much time on short-term, knee-jerk approaches to creating buzz and much less time on building long-term success via well-structured programmes.” Winning Gold and a $5,000 prize cheque, Thomas Henry, Senior Strategist at Mother New York, USA, in his top award-winning essay titled ‘Why we’re all wasting our time’, comes down forcefully on the side of TV over social for long-term brand growth. Admap Prize judge Jason Burby, President of Americas at Possible says: “Whether you believe that TV is the core and future of all marketing, the Gold Award-winning essay tells a compelling story about marketers over-focusing on short-term wins at the expense of considering long-term brand growth. It reminds us that no matter the channel, we as marketers must be focusing on the long-term impact, and that a combination of TV and digital channels leads to improved performance and impact.” The six other winners of the Admap Prize 2017 are: Silver Award: Kyle Findlay of Kantar Innovation, South Africa, for ‘Holistic strategies require a bird’s eye view’ Bronze Award: Matthew Turner, United Kingdom, for ‘Social is the solution to marketing’s esprit de l’escalier moments’ Bronze Award: Charlie Ebdy of Vizeum, United Kingdom, for ‘Screen Wipe: Why social media is slowly killing TV and how it could help transform advertising for the better’ Three Judges’ Commended Awards are awarded to: Gareth Price of The Social Partners, United Kingdom, for ‘Bridging the gap between activation and fame’; Jon Reay of e3 Media, United Kingdom, for ‘Standalone TV ads are nothing than creative indulgence’; and Satish Pai, India, for ‘The tipping points’. The winners will be presented with their awards at an Admap event in Cannes on Wednesday, 21 June, during which members of the Admap jury and senior industry experts will discuss burning issues around the marriage of TV and social and debate over short-term and long-term marketing strategy, To attend this free event, register here. All award-winning essays are published in the June edition of Admap magazine and on warc.com.

Be it the simple-minded Geetha Miss of Ethir Neechal, the effervescent livewire Radha who gets aunt Sridevi to open up in Gauri Shinde’s English Vinglish, or the lovable Priya of Vai Raja Vai, she’s been the go-to girl-next-door. We catch up with her as she becomes the Shiksha Superhero for P&G’s Shiksha initiative, and chats about education, films and what lies ahead: We’ve missed seeing you in Tamil films lately. Why the break? I’ve always been choosy about roles, especially making sure that my character is strong, independent and educated. I am happy that the audience has been warm and welcoming, and I am fortunate to have been able to make films in five languages. Eventually, I would like to take it slow and leave a legacy. You’ve just made your debut in Malayalam films with Ezra. Tell us about that experience. I love the Malayalam film industry. There’s so much respect from both audience and the filmmakers for your craft as an actor. I was intimidated at first: I didn’t want to be labelled as the girl who can’t act. But it’s been an exciting ride. With no prior knowledge of Malayalam, the language barrier was definitely challenging, but it’s been very satisfying to work in an industry where they are open to experimentation. How much does your personality affect the kind of roles you choose? As someone who is the master of her own life, I’m very clear that the characters I play should convey the same spirit. Any plans to direct or produce films in future? Currently, no. As someone who’s seen what goes on, on the other side of the camera, I can’t imagine doing it. The process definitely gives me a new-found respect for the people behind the scenes, but for now, I am happy being in front of the camera. You were also the ambassador of ‘Save the Children’ campaign... While adults can always find opportunities to make their lives better, children do not have that luxury. I was lucky to have loving parents, and for the kids that don’t, I want to make sure they know they are loved.

Research and Markets News provided by Research and Markets 05 Jun, 2017, 11:30 ET Share this article DUBLIN, June 5, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Global Scented Candles Market 2017-2021" report to their offering. The global scented candles market to grow at a CAGR of 5.88% during the period 2017-2021. The report covers the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global scented candles market for 2017-2021. To calculate the market size, the report considers the revenue generated from sales of scented candles used for massage purpose (includes applications in medical and intimacy industries) by end-users such as individuals and spas. The report also includes a discussion of the Key vendors operating in this market. The high sales of scented candles can be attributed to a rapid surge in internet penetration, which has helped connect sellers and buyers. This has increased the sales opportunity for scented candle providers, along with providing options for consumers to choose from a broad range of products. One trend in market is increase in the number of spas. In the last decade, there has been a growth in the number of spas that use scented candles during massages to create a relaxing environment for their customers. Such spas have witnessed tremendous growth, along with the global wellness economy. Scented candles are used by spas for several purposes, including aromatherapy, pain relief, and for intensive treatments for elbows, hands, and feet, and for dry skin. According to the report, one driver in market is product novelty and packaging innovation. In a rapidly changing world, busy lifestyle and the need for easier and faster solutions have provided an opportunity for the manufacturers of scented candles to innovate according to the changing needs. An increase in stress-related cases has also necessitated therapies such as massages that use scented candles to soothe the mind. Further, the report states that one challenge in market is product recalls. There have been instances where scented candles have reportedly cause fires due to fault in products and improper handling of the products. For instance, in January 2015, CoScentrix, a provider of scented candles was forced to recall its particular batch of products due to surface ignition caused by its scented candles.

Recovery Senior Nation You are here: Home / Archives / It’s the Last Picture Show at Chester 5 Theatres It’s the Last Picture Show at Chester 5 Theatres June 5, 2017 by Peter Heck 5 Comments The Chester 5 Theatres movie complex is closing. The Chester 5 Theatres at Washington Square shopping center in Chestertown closed after the final showing Sunday, June 4. The last show was Sunday night, June 4, according to an email to the Spy from a movie-goer who learned of the closing while at the theater. The films on display the final weekend were “Captain Underpants,” “Wonder Woman,” “Pirates of the Caribbean,” “Baywatch” and “Guardians of the Galaxy.” Manager Charlene Fowler, who has been at the theater 18 years, confirmed the closing in a phone call Monday morning. She said business has “dropped off” over the last five years, and the theater was no longer able to turn a profit. Asked what factors contributed to the downturn in business, Fowler said, “Middletown kind of hurt us.” She said the Westown Movies in Middletown has “more up-to-date” facilities, including slanted seating that gives a clear view of the screen from all seats. Also, she said, the Middletown theater has alcohol sales, which Chester 5 could not compete with. She also cited the presence of restaurants and shopping facilities in Middletown as factors that drew possible viewers away from Chestertown. “We had our regulars, but we didn’t draw from a very big crowd,” Fowler said. The comparatively small population of Kent County, along with a small number of the younger families who are typically the audience film makers aim their product toward, undoubtedly had an effect on the theater’s ability to draw. With Washington College between sessions, the timing of the closure is not surprising, either. Alexander, the movie-goer who told the Spy of the closing, said he and his wife were planning to attend the movies on Monday, because they enjoyed the free popcorn that was the theater’s promotion. But checking the website, they saw movie times listed only through Sunday. They decided to go on Saturday. While picking up their tickets, he joked with Fowler that the theater must be closing. She told him she had a meeting with the owners the next morning. Hearing that, the couple decided to return Sunday to see another film they were interested in. After that film, Fowler told them the theater was closing. She said the mall owner was not interested in bringing in another theater to replace it. Posters for two of the movies shown on the final weekend. Chester 5 Theatres were a division of P&G Theaters, which also owns the Essex 5 Theatres in Tappahannock, Va. There was no answer to a call to the number listed for the theater manager, but the recorded message listed showings through Thursday, with features much the same as at the Chester 5 Theaters. Fowler said she had seen declining sales at the theater since its conversion to digital technology about five years ago. She said she wasn’t sure whether options such as Netflix and cable TV movie channels were a factor in the drop in attendance. With the closing of the Chester 5 Theatres, the Westown Theater in Middletown is the closest movie venue to Chestertown, with theaters in Dover, Easton and Annapolis slightly farther away.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 June 2017 by Abhishek Budholiya Global Cold, Cough and Sore Throat Remedies Market anticipated to incur sluggish growth at 3.2% CAGR, 2026 Seeking professional medical help for curing cold, cough or sore throat is become a rare practice, let alone getting admitted in a hospital. Prevalence of cold, cough & sore throat problems through the ages has made people more independent in terms of treating them. In the years to come, effective home remedies will continue to gain traction and people will be taking care of their cold or sore throat through such easy-to-treat remedies. Future Market Insights’ latest report delivers such discernments that are expected to leave a considerable imprint on the global market for cold, cough & sore throat remedies. Based on the report, the global cold, cough & sore throat remedies market is presently valued at US$ 32.4 Bn, and is anticipated to incur sluggish growth at 3.2% CAGR to bring in just over US$ 45.4 Bn by the end of 2026. The report distinctly indicates that rising adoption of self-medication practices and effective home remedies is restraining the market’s overall growth. Ask For Report Sample@ http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-1292 In the report, titled “Cold, Cough and Sore Throat Remedies Market: Global Industry Analysis and Opportunity Assessment, 2016-2026,” affordability of OTC drugs, rising economic burden of respiratory diseases, availability of medications in variable dosages, and fast & instant relief delivered through such cold, cough & sore throat remedies are driving the market’s growth. Nevertheless, the demand for cold, cough & sore throat remedies is less likely to soar at a healthy rate. Product Recalls & Low Entry of New Players Impacting the Market’s Growth Firstly, the global cold, cough & sore throat remedies market is projected to witness umpteen product recalls. Global leaders in pharmaceuticals industry such as Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Bayer AG, GlaxoSmithKline plc., and Reckitt Benckiser Group plc are key players in the global market for cold, cough & sore throat remedies. Despite, there are several newly-launched products that have been recalled after FDA’s censure. Besides, even consumer goods behemoths such as Procter & Gamble Co. and Johnson & Johnson Services Inc. are partaking in the market’s growth. This has resulted in a lowering entry of emerging drugmakers, which has further distorted the market’s growth. Other leading manufacturers of cold, cough & sore throat remedies include AstraZeneca plc, Prestige Brands Inc., and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. The report highlights how Asia-Pacific excluding Japan (APEJ) region will remain the largest market for cold, cough & sore throat remedies. The region’s proximity to environmental pollution makes its residents more prone to respiratory diseases. With over 30% stake in global revenues, the APEJ cold, cough & sore throat remedies market will global dominate through 2026. North America and Europe will also remain at the forefront, by collectively accounting for nearly half of the global revenues throughout the forecast period. Ask For More Information@ http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/askus/rep-gb-1292 The report further reveals that in 2017 and beyond, the demand for antihistamine drugs, expectorants and decongestants will remain considerably high as these revenues from sales of these drugs will showcase growth at more than 3% CAGR. Tablets or pills and nasal drops will also dominate as dosage types, accounting for over 40% share of market value through 2026. The report also predicts retail pharmacies & drug stores as the largest distribution channels for cold, cough & sore throat remedies. Together, these channels will bring in nearly US$ 30 Bn by the end of 2026.

PANAJI: Around 1,700 government and government aided schools reopen on Monday for the academic session 2017-18. More than two lakh students from primary, high schools and higher secondary schools will return to school on the day after the summer break. "We have decided to lay more stress on value-based education from the new academic year," director of education G P Bhat said. In the new academic year, the state government has signed an MoU with Pune-based Mutha Foundation to provide education to children in waste management, traffic management and menstrual hygiene for girls as part of the curriculum. At least two classes in these subjects will be conducted for students in a week and they will be assessed by their respective schools in the subjects, Bhat said. "The subjects will be introduced in Class III and IV during the current academic year and in Classes V to VIII and Classes IX to X in the subsequent years in a phased manner," Bhat said. The scheme will be implemented within the next two months, he said. Procter & Gamble, personnel from the Saligao waste treatment plant, experts like Patricia Pinto and officials from the Goa Education Development Corporation, state traffic cell and the state council for educational research and training have been roped in to draw up the curriculum for the subject, Bhat said. Also, no new schools have been granted permissions to open in the new academic year. The 2017-18 academic year will also have two fewer working days for schools, as the directorate of education has brought Goa on a par with the rest of India as per the requirements of the Right To Educate (RTE) Act. Goa, which had 236 working days last year, will now have 234. There is no change in the number of minimum instructional days at 200. School instructional hours also remain the same — five-and-a-half.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Meet Warren Buffett's 2 Trusted Stock Pickers This pair is likely to take over Berkshire’s investment portfolio after the Oracle of Omaha is gone. Matthew Frankel (TMFMathGuy) Jun 4, 2017 at 8:03AM Warren Buffett is well known for his stock-picking acumen. As I wrote in a recent article, some of Buffett's stock investments have increased more than tenfold since he bought them for Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) portfolio. So it may surprise you to learn that it's not only Buffett calling the shots in Berkshire's stock portfolio anymore. Within the past several years, Buffett has added two stock-pickers to the mix, and they've been responsible for some of Berkshire's most notable recent stock investments. Here's a quick background on Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, and what the pair's role could evolve into, especially when Buffett is no longer running Berkshire. Warren Buffett loves running Berkshire Hathaway, but he knows he won't be around forever. Image source: The Motley Fool. Meet Ted and Todd For much of the time Buffett has been at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, he has managed the company's stock portfolio all by himself. However, that has changed in recent years with the hiring of two investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who were hired in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Both men are hedge fund veterans with impressive track records. For example, Weschler's fund delivered 1,236% in gains in just 11 years before he closed it -- roughly 9 times the gain of Buffett's stock portfolio during the same time frame. Combs ran a hedge fund from 2005 to 2010, and his returns over that period were 34%. That may not sound too impressive, but recall that this time period contained the Great Recession, and the S&P 500's total return was just 2.9% for those years, so it's fair to say that Combs' fund beat the market by a considerable margin. A significant component of Buffett's investment strategy is to consistently beat the market in bad years, so this may be one factor that made Combs attractive for the position. Weschler initially met Buffett as the winner of two charity auctions, in 2010 and 2011, where the prize was a lunch with Buffett himself. Weschler's winning bids: $2,626,311 and $2,626,411 -- a total of more than $5.2 million. Reportedly, Weschler's investment success -- and, more importantly, how he achieved it -- impressed Buffett at the lunches. The results have been strong so far Buffett told CNBC in an interview that hiring the pair is "one of the best decisions that Charlie [Munger] and I have ever made." He's even gone so far as to say that "they've made more money than I would have" with the capital they've been entrusted with. Weschler has reportedly opened Buffett's eyes to sectors he had previously avoided, specifically technology. For example, Buffett's Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) investment started as a roughly $1 billion stake in early 2016 and was reportedly initiated by Weschler. Buffett himself has increased the position many times over since then. Combs has also changed Buffett's thinking in a few instances. It was Combs who reportedly convinced Buffett to acquire the Duracell battery brand and get rid of Berkshire's position in Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) stock. And the pair have made some pretty successful investments for Berkshire themselves in their relatively short tenure. For example, their first notable win was DIRECTV, of which about 36.5 million shares were acquired in the ball park of $42 to $47 per share. The bulk of it was converted into AT&T stock and cash when the telecom giant acquired the company in 2015, at a valuation of more than $93 per share. Increasing responsibilities Since Weschler and Combs started at Berkshire, they have been given an increasing amount of Berkshire's money to invest. As of Buffett's 2016 letter to shareholders, each man manages over $10 billion -- about $21 billion altogether, which includes $7.6 billion of the pension trust assets of Berkshire subsidiaries. This is still a small fraction of Berkshire's roughly $150 billion stock portfolio, but it's far more than the $2 billion Buffett says they started with. And Buffett stresses that each manages this money independently. In fact, Buffett says he usually doesn't learn about investment decisions they've made until he looks at Berkshire's monthly trade sheets. In addition to their stock-picking responsibilities, both men have some of Berkshire's operating subsidiaries reporting directly to them, Combs confirmed in a recent interview. Their future role at Berkshire After Buffett picked Berkshire's stock investments himself for years, it may seem strange that he would reduce his role. However, it's important to point out that the reason Weschler (who is 56) and Combs (46) have been brought on, and given an increasingly large sum of money to invest, is that Buffett wants to make sure Berkshire's investment methods live on long after he's no longer at the helm. In his 2014 shareholder letter, which marked 50 years of the Buffettera at Berkshire, Buffett laid out his vision for the next 50 years of Berkshire. In the discussion, Buffett said that in the area of investments, "We are in fine shape for decades to come," referring to Weschler and Combs as "first-rate in all respects." He also said that they would continue to handle Berkshire's investment decisions and will be of particular help to the next CEO in evaluating acquisitions. To sum it up, if you were wondering what Buffett's plans are for the future of Berkshire's closely watched stock portfolio once he's no longer at the helm, these two investment managers are it. And if their early performance is any indicator, it looks as if Berkshire investors will have their money in good hands. Matthew Frankel owns shares of Apple and Berkshire Hathaway (B shares).

As consumers shift away from brick and mortar towards eCommerce for consumables, the popularity of Amazon's services such as Prime, Pantry and Fresh is gaining ground. This is according to research from One Click Retail, a leader in eCommerce data measurement, sales analytics and search optimization for global brand manufacturers. Health & Personal Care One Click Retail's Health & Personal Care report reveals that Amazon is the best growth opportunity for HPC brands, given that US total HPC sales increased only about 1% in Q1 2017. Amazon already earned $1.3 billion, or 27.5% of the total annual sales, in 2016.  The real MVP of Amazon's HPC product group continues to be Prime Pantry. With more shoppers buying into exclusive Amazon Pantry access, the rate of growth for HPC (and most other product categories) is much higher in Pantry than in the general marketplace, with top categories multiplying by hundreds of percentage points. The leading Amazon HPC category is Hair Care in the U.S. (85% growth), and Household Consumables (440% growth) in the UK. Baby Products In the Q1 2017, total US baby products revenues dropped 10%. Most of this decrease took place in offline sales, allowing eCommerce market share to rise from 20% to 22%. The Baby Products category enjoyed the highest eCommerce CPG penetration, with Amazon having 43% of the total. Q1 Amazon US sales of diapers increased 30%, baby food 15%, and baby formula 80%. In both the US and the UK, Amazon saw triple-digit growth of top brands like Pampers (700% increase). Grocery One Click Retail reports 30% growth in Amazon Grocery averaged across the US, UK and Germany, driven by the growing adoption of Amazon Prime in Q1 2017. Traditionally, grocery has been less susceptible to the shift towards eCommerce (in 2016, only 5% of U.S. grocery sales occurred online). According to Amazon sales data calculations for Q1 2017, Amazon's grocery sales outpaced that of the total market fifteen-fold. "The popularity of perishables is growing rapidly, not only because consumers are becoming more comfortable with buying their groceries online but also because Amazon is improving its delivery times and offering more fulfillment options," explains Spencer Millerberg, One Click Retail CEO. "There are now more than 65 million Amazon Prime subscribers and they are more likely to buy their groceries online than non-subscribers. Last year's sharp rise in Prime membership has continued into Q1 2017. With more shoppers buying exclusive access to Amazon Pantry, the rate of growth for most consumables is much higher in Pantry than in the general marketplace, with top categories multiplying revenue by as much as 5 times. As Amazon continues to corner the market, CPGs in the U.S., U.K. and Germany would be smart to engage with Amazon Prime members as their target audience."

View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170603005047/en/ “Dollar General is excited to celebrate the grand opening of our Janesville distribution center and it is an honor to welcome Speaker Ryan to our facility as well as state and local leaders who supported this project,” said Todd Vasos, Dollar General’s chief executive officer. “We have built a strong team in Janesville, and this new facility strengthens our distribution network and our ability to serve customers. We are delighted to have a strong presence in Wisconsin and look forward to a longstanding partnership with the community as we continue to focus on our mission of Serving Others.” Construction began on the approximately one-million-square-foot facility in November 2015 and shipping from the facility began in January 2017. The Janesville distribution center serves approximately 800 stores in nine states in the upper Midwest. With the completion of this project and its more than 130 store locations in the state, Dollar General now has more than 1,300 employees in the state of Wisconsin. Negotiations with the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, and local and county representatives produced an incentive package that ultimately solidified Dollar General’s commitment to Wisconsin. “Congratulations to Dollar General on the opening of its new facility, which is creating hundreds of new jobs in the region. It will have a very positive impact on Rock County and the rest of the state,” said Governor Scott Walker. “The pro-business climate in Wisconsin is attracting more companies like Dollar General to our state, which is part of the reason Chief Executive Magazine just placed us on its Top 10 list of the Best States for Business.” “I am thrilled Dollar General has decided to build its new distribution center in my hometown, Janesville,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan. “I believe the employees and employers in the Badger State can compete with anyone, and with pro-growth policies like tax and regulatory reform, we can help to continue to create jobs.” As part of the celebration, Dollar General donated $10,000 to the Hedberg Public Library to support its literacy and outreach initiatives. “Dollar General has been an outstanding addition to our local economy and great community partner,” said Josh Smith, Rock County administrator. “We look forward to continuing to work with them as a strong member of our community for years to come.” “The City of Janesville is proud to be able to say that it is home to a key component of one of the fastest growing retailers in the United States,” said Gale Price, economic development director, City of Janesville. “In addition to the over 500 jobs that will be added to the Janesville and Rock County economy, Dollar General and its employees are engaged in important community activities that help make Janesville a community of choice.” Dollar General’s 13 other distribution centers are located in Alachua, Florida; Ardmore, Oklahoma; Bessemer, Alabama; Bethel, Pennsylvania; Fulton, Missouri; Indianola, Mississippi; Jonesville, South Carolina; Lebec, California; Marion, Indiana; San Antonio, Texas; Scottsville, Kentucky; South Boston, Virginia; and Zanesville, Ohio. The company has begun construction on its 15th distribution center in Jackson, Georgia, and is planning for its 16 [th] distribution center in Amsterdam, New York. Clayco Inc. served as general contractor for the Janesville distribution center. Leo A Daly did the building design and Élan Design Lab, Inc. did the civil design work.
