Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Sep 28, 2016 at 2:21PM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is flush with cash thanks to a portfolio reboot that's involved selling off a few valuable brands, including Duracell batteries and Coty beauty products. Yet weak operating trends have produced two consecutive years of disappointing dividend raises for income investors. The consumer products giant boosted its payout by 3% last year and by just 1% in 2016. So today I'm looking at Target (NYSE:TGT), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ): Three stocks that investors might prefer over P&G right now. Here's how the dividends stack up against each other. Dividend comparison Metric Procter & Gamble Target Coca-Cola Johnson & Johnson Yield 3% 3.5% 3% 2.7% Last raise 1% 7% 6% 7% Payout ratio 76% 44% 77% 57% Data sources: Company financial filings and S&P Capital IQ data. Last raise is the most recent percent change in the dividend. Target for the yield Target's stock is out of favor right now in part due to a slowdown in the retailing industry. Yet the company has stumbled enough to separate itself from peers -- and not in a good way. Customer traffic dropped last quarter, even as Wal-Mart's rose. And Target's comparable-store sales are negative at the same time that grocery competitor Kroger has pushed its growth streak past 50 straight quarters. Investors have punished the stock for those missteps: Target is now valued at less than 13 times earnings, compared to a price-to-earnings ratio of 15 for both Kroger and Wal-Mart. Investors who believe the retailer will recover from this recent slump, as it has many times in its near 50-year history, might be enticed by that discount -- especially considering that Target boasts a market-beating 3.5% dividend yield, a low payout ratio, and a strong track record for recent dividend increases. Coca-Cola for the profits Like P&G, Coca-Cola is making a major structural change that it hopes will produce a leaner, more profitable, and faster-growing enterprise. Rather than sell off parts of its portfolio, though, the beverage giant is refranchising a large portion of its bottlers. Coke is aiming to produce a turnaround in the disappointing operating trends that drove volume growth of just 1% through the first two quarters of 2016. CEO Muhtar Kent and his team have identified several levers that the company can pull to achieve that goal, including focusing on emerging markets like China and India while investing heavily in non-soda brands like waters and juices. Its hefty dividend, meanwhile, should continue climbing at a steady pace as the refranchising initiative boosts profitability. Johnson & Johnson for innovation Johnson & Johnson may not pay as meaty a yield as P&G right now (2.7% vs. 3%), but that's partly because the stock is up so sharply. Shares have more than doubled over the last five years including dividend reinvestments, compared to a market-lagging 71% rise for P&G. JNJ Total Return Price data by YCharts. Its dividend growth rate is impressive, too: J&J's payout has improved at a 7% compound annual rate over the last five years and by nearly 9% over the past decade. Yet one of the best reasons to like J&J over Procter & Gamble is that, while both companies admit that innovation is critical to their entire business model, only one has demonstrated consistent success at it. Johnson & Johnson dedicates $9 billion to research and development each year and investors see the fruits of that spending: Roughly 25% of sales last year came from products that J&J introduced in just the past five years. In contrast, P&G hasn't launched a new $1 billion product in over a decade. Procter & Gamble pays one of the most dependable dividends on the market, raising it for 60 consecutive years. As impressive as that streak is, however, the latest hike was for less than $0.01 per share. Income investors have plenty of options for stronger dividend growth than that.

Crunch Network Large CPGs are under attack by startups… and consumers are winning Posted Sep 28, 2016 by Tien Tzuo (@tientzuo) 0 SHARES Next Story Uber teams with Sears on new rewards program for drivers and riders Tien Tzuo Crunch Network Contributor Tien Tzuo is the CEO of Zuora. More posts by this contributor: To compete with Amazon, Walmart should cut itself in half How Prince and Bowie started streaming music services How to join the network Consumer packaged goods are big business — valued at more than $2 trillion — with much of that market share dominated by CPG powerhouses like Unilever, P&G and Nestlé. These CPG leaders know a lot about packaged goods — a lot about how to manufacture and market and sell at scale. But, as is becoming more and more apparent, they don’t really know very much at all about their customers. And this is proving to be a problem. The issue is built into the category: The large CPG companies don’t sell directly to their consumers. They sell to retailers like Walmart, who then sell to consumers. So the CPG giants miss the whole direct-to-consumer relationship. They have no access to — or insight into — the people who actually buy and use their products. And now they’re under attack by a new breed of digitally native, vertically integrated startups that are reinventing what it means to buy everything — from razor blades to toothbrushes to mattresses. Bonobos, Warby Parker, Birchbox, Harry’s, Casper… the list goes on. These guys are keenly interested in establishing smart relationships with their customers, and they are establishing flexible, recurring revenue-based business models to make it happen. In this new environment, it’s getting harder for CPGs to grow as they’ve traditionally done. Look at P&G (owner of the Gillette razor brand) which lost 12 percent share of the men’s razor and blade industry last year, while upstart direct-to-consumer razor startup Dollar Shave Club claimed 5 percent of the market. The big vendors can try to buy their way out of the problem — much like how Unilever eventually bought Dollar Shave Club. But in order to stay relevant, they’re going to have to embrace digital transformation and incorporate direct-to-consumer strategies into their own business model. Here are seven strategies that leading CPGs can — and must — adopt to better engage with consumers in the digital age. E-commerce. As recently as 2013, only about 3 percent of non-food consumer packaged goods was purchased through online sales. But online sale of consumer packaged goods is starting to pick up, and the CPG powerhouses are getting on board. In the 2014 Customer Channel Management Survey from McKinsey, which surveyed 50+ CPG leaders, e-commerce was “ranked as the second leading driver of change over the next five years.” The potential for CPG online sales is only going to grow as e-commerce giants like Amazon increase their focus on the sale of groceries and personal care products with Amazon Pantry. In addition, CPGs can explore distribution to niche online retailers like Ulta or Drugstore.com, as well as individual brands selling direct to consumers online. Social. Leading CPG companies are used to selling their consumer goods through the middleman of retail partners and rely heavily on in-store marketing to propel their brands. Startups, without the deep pockets of these CPG powerhouses, must look elsewhere to create their brands. Consumers have changed — and the consumer packaged goods industry needs to respond. Social is the solution. People have always looked to their networks for trusted recommendations, but now this old-school practice has met the digital age as consumers look to their online social networks for product suggestions. Companies can use social platforms to spread the word and build their brands, while capitalizing on accessible platforms like YouTube to generate buzz. For example, Dollar Shave Club led a master class in social with their hilarious 2012 YouTube video introducing their brand: “our blades are f**king great.” Just six hours after release, their entire inventory sold out and the video has gone on to garner over 4.75 million views. When done well, social is an effective (and inexpensive) way to connect directly with consumers to create accessible, and sought-after, brands. Digital first. Brick-and-mortar retailers used to be paranoid about people coming into their stores and then finding cheaper things online. Now people are doing online research and using retail stores as showrooms. The digital influence has flipped the script. Smart companies are using digital to create a brand, and a brand experience, rather than push products. For example, look at a company like Casper, which doesn’t promote itself as merely a mattress company, but rather a digital-first brand focused around the concept of sleep. Subscriptions. The CPG industry is made up of products that people are always going to need, and that frequently need to be replaced. You know what this sounds like? An industry ready to be subscriptionized! A subscription model isn’t just about the recurring revenue derived from repeat purchases; it’s a key to developing ongoing relationships. When your consumer becomes a subscriber, that establishes a relationship — and that foundation is one that businesses can build on and monetize. Niche focus. We’ve seen CPG leaders cutting smaller brands and not seeking out new brands as they instead focus their efforts on a small number of core brands. For example, P&G announced last year that they were planning on divesting about 100 “non-core” brands in favor of honing their focus on 70 choice brands. Related Articles Away, The Direct-To-Consumer Luggage Brand, Packs Up $2.5 Million FTC Officials Back Tesla's Right To Sell Cars Direct To Consumers Rue La La’s Founder Returns With M.Gemi, Direct-To-Consumer Italian Footwear But consumers don’t care about “distribution efficiency” for CPG companies. They care about getting the products they need, when they need them. Consumers don’t want less choice and mass-produced products. They want convenience, accessibility and an improved consumer experience. This is why companies like oral care product Hello are making their mark with their niche products, quirky flavors and a personable approach to consumers. In-store technology. As consumers demand ever-improved shopping experiences (and the best deals), many retailers are looking to technology to enhance the consumer experience. This includes more prosaic options like price-checking stands, but it’s also transformative technology like Sephora’s Fragrance IQ, an interactive kiosk that uses tech to provide consumers with customized fragrance recommendations. And it’s also beacon technology: hardware that sends push notifications to targeted consumers. This means that RiteAid can send you discount coupons as soon as you enter the store. Internet of Things. We’re just starting to see the potential of IoT, but already we can see that it poses a huge opportunity for CPG companies. As connected devices become more popular, they’re going to completely cut out the middleman, with washing machines ordering more detergent when they’re running low, or refrigerators placing a milk order. In short, consumers have changed — and the consumer packaged goods industry needs to respond. The leading CPG Goliaths may not yet be fearing the advancing Davids, but they should be watching. The share shift to these direct-to-consumer brands is gaining momentum, and these upstart brands are collectively leading a movement. If the CPG giants can ride the wave of digital transformation and adapt to the Subscription Economy, they will continue to drive growth while putting the “Consumer” back into “Consumer Packaged Goods.” Featured Image: ferlistockphoto/Getty Images 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe Latest Crunch Report Tesla Acquisition of SolarCity Approved | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Consumer packaged goods eCommerce Popular Posts Featured Stories Shareholders approve Tesla acquisition of SolarCity 19 hours ago | Darrell Etherington Airbnb is turning itself into an ‘experience’ machine beyond just booking places to stay 22 hours ago | Matthew Lynley Open source and coopetition are the new normal 23 hours ago | Ron Miller YC tries a new experiment: temporary partners 23 hours ago | Connie Loizos Latest From TechCrunch BMW and Baidu’s self-driving car partnership has reportedly run out of gas 22 minutes ago | Jon Russell Sesame Street’s VC fund makes its first investment in tutoring app Yup 36 minutes ago | Lora Kolodny Sony’s Xperia Ear wearable voice assistant will be available in December for $200 53 minutes ago | Brian Heater Google reverses its ‘digital death sentence’ for Pixel phone resellers 1 hour ago | Sarah Perez Comment moderation powered by Up Next Uber teams with Sears on new rewards program for drivers and riders Posted Sep 28, 2016 CrunchBoard Job Listings Director, Software Security @ Practice Fusion at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Developer at CastleBranch (Wilmington, NC, United States) Infrastructure Engineer Tango at The Sourcery (Mountain View, CA, United States) Senior Software Engineer @ Pared at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Software Engineer @ Pared at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2016 AOL Inc.

The split-off transaction is a key step in the previously announced separation from P&G of its global fine fragrances, salon professional, cosmetics and retail hair color businesses, along with select hair styling brands (collectively referred to as "P&G Specialty Beauty Brands"). In the proposed transaction, P&G will transfer the assets and liabilities of P&G Specialty Beauty Brands, other than specified excluded brands, to Galleria Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of P&G created to facilitate the transaction. Following completion of the exchange offer, Galleria Co. will merge with a subsidiary of Coty Inc. (NYSE:COTY) and become a wholly owned subsidiary of Coty. The exchange offer provides P&G shareholders with the opportunity to exchange their shares of P&G common stock for shares of Galleria Co. common stock. Each share of Galleria Co. common stock will be converted into the right to receive one share of Coty class A common stock upon completion of the merger, which is expected to occur as promptly as practicable following completion of the exchange offer. P&G is offering 409,726,299 shares of Galleria Co. common stock for shares of P&G common stock. Based on the final exchange ratio, P&G will accept for exchange a maximum of 104,969,205 shares of P&G common stock in the exchange offer. P&G shareholders who tender their shares of P&G common stock in the exchange offer will receive approximately 3.9033 shares of Coty class A common stock (subject to receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares) for each share of P&G common stock accepted for exchange. The exchange and the merger are expected to be tax-free to participating P&G shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The final calculated per-share value of the shares of P&G common stock and the final calculated per-share value of the shares of Galleria Co. common stock, in each case determined in the manner described in the Prospectus dated September 1, 2016 (the "Prospectus"), would have resulted in an exchange ratio higher than the upper limit of 3.9033. Accordingly, the final exchange ratio has been set at 3.9033 shares of Galleria Co. common stock for each share of P&G common stock accepted in the exchange offer. Based on the calculated per-share value of P&G common stock and the calculated per-share value of Galleria Co. common stock, in each case determined in the manner described in the Prospectus, tendering P&G shareholders will receive approximately $1.042 of Coty class A common stock for each $1.00 of P&G common stock accepted in the exchange offer. The exchange offer and withdrawal rights will expire at 12:00 midnight (the last minute of the day), Eastern Daylight (New York City) Time, on September 29, 2016, unless extended or terminated. The exchange offer will be subject to proration if the exchange offer is oversubscribed, and the number of shares of P&G common stock accepted in the exchange offer may be fewer than the number of shares tendered. If the exchange offer is completed but not fully subscribed, P&G will distribute all of the shares of Galleria Co. common stock it continues to own as a pro rata dividend to all P&G shareholders whose shares of P&G common stock remain outstanding and have not been accepted for exchange in the exchange offer. As promptly as practicable following completion of the exchange offer and, if the exchange offer is completed but is not fully subscribed, the subsequent pro rata dividend of all remaining shares of Galleria Co. common stock to the remaining P&G shareholders, a wholly owned subsidiary of Coty will merge with and into Galleria Co., with Galleria Co. surviving the merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Coty. The transactions are subject to customary closing conditions, including a minimum tender condition. For more information about the proposed transaction, please visit the website that P&G maintains for the exchange offer at www.dfking.com/pg. For more information about the exchange offer, please contact the information agent, D.F. King Co., Inc., at (212) 269-5550 (for banks and brokers) and (877) 297-1747 (for all other callers).

( ) Print Email Stephen Koff, cleveland.com By Stephen Koff, cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Follow on Twitter on September 27, 2016 at 1:29 PM, updated September 28, 2016 at 9:33 AM comments WASHINGTON -- Some of Ohio's most prominent companies, including Procter & Gamble, Timken and Invacare, told President Barack Obama's administration today that regulations intended to crack down on corporate tax loopholes will harm businesses instead. The 47 companies' concern is a set of rules designed to keep corporations from shifting their ownership to lower-tax countries in a set of unusual transactions, with a smaller foreign company buying a larger U.S.-based one. This is known as a corporate inversion, and companies that have inverted include Mentor-based Steris and Cleveland-based Eaton Corp., both now part of once-smaller companies based in, respectively, Great Britain and Ireland. These and other companies that already operated internationally justify their moves as making sense for strategic global-business reasons. But the Obama administration and other critics note that inversions result in shifting corporate profits to headquarters in countries with lower tax rates. The inversion may change little if anything in U.S. operations. Even though they're now based abroad, the corporations can still get U.S. government contracts, for example. But a foreign headquarters saves the company money on income taxes -- or, as critics see it, costs the United States tax revenue. Moving offshore? Here, have another contract. In April, the Treasury Department released rules and proposals to clamp down. The clampdown, however, could create more harm than good, say the Ohio businesses, in a letter to Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew. The letter was signed by, among others, Procter & Gamble, Timken, Invacare, Steris, Whirlpool, Cardinal Health, Forest City Realty Trust, and Ohio-based operations of Nestle, Anheuser-Bush, Miller Coors and the Kraft Heinz Company.  Most of these companies are headquartered in the United States and have not announced plans to change that. The problem is that the proposed regulations would affect any company with cross-border operations, regardless of whether it inverted, according to the Organization for International Investment, another critic of the proposal. The proposed regulations "go far beyond Treasury's stated intent to curtail abusive transactions," the letter from the Ohio companies said. "If the regulations were to become final in their current form, they would significantly impede the ability of our businesses to invest and create jobs in Ohio." What Obama wants to do: Part of what Treasury rolled out in April used existing authority to restrict tax savings for so-called serial inverters -- companies that inverted overseas and then, within three years, became part of yet another inversion scheme with another U.S.-based company. Without the tax savings, the companies would lose an incentive to merge. The announcement served to kill a planned merger by U.S.-based Pfizer, a pharmaceutical maker, with Allergan, which is based in Ireland as a result of earlier mergers. Another part of the restrictions -- the one addressed specifically by the Ohio companies -- is not yet final. It would restrict a technique used to shift debt from a foreign operation to a U.S.-based affiliate. This gives the appearance that the U.S. operation has lower earnings (because of the debt), reducing its U.S tax obligation. The Obama administration wants to restrict this practice -- called earnings stripping -- unless the debt is actually used to finance U.S. business operations. The change would recharacterize certain debt instruments as equity -- also known as stock. This would then affect the tax deductions of interest payments on the debt, some of which might have to be treated as dividends instead. The IRS would make the determinations. Why the companies object: If the IRS interjects itself in decisions about what is and isn't legitimate debt, the Ohio companies contend, it will result in unfounded and possibly unfair decisions. The main points of the companies' complaint: "The proposed regulations will complicate, and in some cases eliminate, our companies' ability to self-finance our job growth and could obstruct access to capital." "The broad language of the regulations creates uncertainty resulting in serious hesitation to make long-term commitments in an already challenging business environment. The regulations would inflict significant costs on our businesses, with no direct or indirect benefit to consumers, by mandating new and extensive tracking, documentation and compliance requirements." "Finally, the subjective nature of the regulations and the new bifurcation authority given to the IRS would all-but ensure compliance issues and increased controversy." What happens next: Complaints from businesses have rolled in, and some of the Ohio companies already signed comments sent to Treasury. A date for finalizing the regulations has not been announced but is likely soon. The Business Roundtable and other leading corporate groups have already said they expect the regulations to be challenged in court if they are finalized as proposed. Today's letter simply lays down another marker from the business community. How politics enter the picture: The letter was prepared and circulated well before Monday night's presidential debate. But the topic of corporate taxes and loopholes became fodder in the debate as Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton said she supported efforts to bring back "money that's stranded overseas." Republican Donald Trump said lower corporate tax rates would solve the problem. "I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses," Trump said. At 35 percent, this country's federal corporate tax rate is the world's highest. But analysts point out that many companies use tax strategies and deductions to avoid paying that rate. That's a point used by both sides, one that wants to curtail the use of loopholes and the other that says a lower, more equitable rate would eliminate the need for tax gamesmanship. Trump's remarks -- and the Ohio businesses' letter -- goes to a point made repeatedly by other Republicans including U.S. Sen. Rob Portman. Portman, who also faces an election in November, says Congress needs to rework the corporate tax code in a comprehensive way rather than tackling it a piece at a time. Portman's office today played a role in making sure the businesses' letter got out to the press. "This letter is just another sign that one-off solutions to combat inversions and foreign acquisitions are not the answer to cure our broken tax code," Portman said in a statement. "These new, complex rules will make our already burdensome tax laws even more complicated, and, as the letter states, will make it harder for businesses to grown and create jobs here at home." The answer, Portman said, is "comprehensive international tax reform that lets businesses invest and create jobs here in the United States."

About Us Our People Advertising News Sports Shows WV Poll Outdoors West Virginia P&G plant flooded with applicants wvmetronews.com A recent flyover shows how much progress has been made on the P&G site. Share Article By Brad McElhinny in News | September 27, 2016 at 11:02AM CHARLESTON, W.Va. — Procter & Gamble’s new plant in the Eastern Panhandle has drawn 1,100 applicants already — so many the company had to shut down its application portal for a few months last spring. “We were getting so much traction that we couldn’t keep up with the demand,” said P&G spokesman Jeff LeRoy. The application portal is back open, and Procter & Gamble has hired its first 18 plant technicians for the $500 million Tabler Station facility that will eventually produce products like Bounce fabric enhancers, shampoos and body wash. “It’s more applicants than we expected at this point,” LeRoy said. “We were getting overwhelmed early on. We didn’t expect it to be so fast. We’re extremely pleased. That was one of the reasons that attracted us to this area of West Virginia.” Eventually, Procter & Gamble expects to employ 700 full-time workers at the facility, which is about four miles south of Martinsburg. “This moment is what it’s all about,” said Keith Burdette, executive director of the state Development Office. “All the work that goes into recruiting a company and bringing a project to fruition –  it’s all about the moment when we get to see hard working West Virginians begin careers that will support their families for generations to come. And P&G is one of the best companies to work for in the world. The impact it’s going to have on this state is huge, and it starts now.” Of the first 18 employees, a dozen are already Eastern Panhandle residents, two are from other places in West Virginia, and the others are from Maryland and Virginia. “Of the 18, a quarter are veterans, several are women. It’s a diverse group,” LeRoy said. Those 18 have already started preparing for their work at P&G. “They’re in a training program now,” LeRoy said. “We expect to continue to accept applications now through the plant opening next fall and beyond.” LeRoy said P&G looks for standouts among 5 “buckets of skills”: mechanical skills or aptitude, electrical skills or aptitude, people with experience in manufacturing and production, making and packing operations and people with experience in equipment and machinery operations. “We’re looking for not only people who have skills in certain areas, but who demonstrate a range of expertise,” LeRoy said. “We’re looking for people who show interest personally too. If somebody is really into mechanical applications, we find that they do that in their personal life as well.” Jobseekers must begin with the P&G’s website portal, which starts with an online application and then moves on to an online skills assessment before potentially progressing to an in-person interview. “It’s not ‘Do you know a friend?’ or ‘Your cousin works at P&G.’ You have to go through that portal,” LeRoy said. LeRoy suggested that applicants who need to improve their skills should enroll at Blue Ridge Community and Technical College, which has a partnership with P&G. “We expect as we go forward to hire more people out of Blue Ridge,” LeRoy said. “If someone doesn’t have the skills or they’re concerned they might not, I would recommend them to Blue Ridge.” This is just the second new plant Procter & Gamble has built since 1971. It’s expected to open in 2017. “We’re just at the beginning of this journey,” LeRoy said.

Subscribe Now A Hyper-Targeted Audience Is Not Necessarily the Right Audience Staying focused on people, not proxies By Gerry Bavaro September 27, 2016, 11:45 PM EDT Sponsored There's a reason Procter & Gamble is pumping the brakes on its Facebook targeting efforts. And it's no coincidence that Y&R's CEO contends it's time to rethink ad targeting. While targeting is a valuable tool for marketers, its lack of context and accuracy annoys consumers to the point where they're opting out of ads altogether, and the industry is taking note. For most brands, targeting should not be a primary focus. That's because a hyper-targeted audience is not necessarily the correct audience much of the time. Instead, marketers and buyers should be thinking about audience quality. The correct audience has fidelity. They're not reached by just demographic identifiers or tracking cookies but by messaging that's personal, in-context and highly relevant to their needs and emotions. By contrast, much of the low-fidelity targeting based on cookies, panel data and device IDs in market today creates a blurred perception of your audience at best. For example, you might think you're retargeting ads to a woman who browsed your site for high heels, but it's just as likely you're bombarding her husband with discounts for pumps. In another scenario, millennials might be your target, but some millennials are bankers with two kids and a house, while others just up and moved to Colorado to work in a tackle shop. If you serve these two different consumers the same ad, you're giving both a bad experience. It's no wonder over 40 million of them have turned on ad blockers. This doesn't mean we have to abandon programmatic tools and targeting. But instead of simply toggling a switch to target an audience, brands and buyers need to do the upstream work to ensure the accuracy, relevance and potential receptivity of that audience to a message are spot on. They need to use high-fidelity, people-based data to better inform their creative, their content planning, audience creation and the dynamic ad and content decisions that occur across the consumer journey. That means the consumer's experience begins with relevant awareness, interest and action that carries through to landing pages, emails and offers consumers get after clicking an ad. This is not a fantasy. Merkle's Publisher Addressable Marketplaces, aka PAM, lets advertisers match their CRM data on an individual level with extensive audience information provided by Merkle as well as premium publishers, including Pandora, Realtor.com and LiveIntent. Informed by this extensive data, and linked together by a person level ID, clients can build compelling, personalized ads that get served against the publishers' most desirable content—to exactly the right people. Consumers get a vastly better ad experience. The result of high-fidelity audiences and targeting models that are built on rich, person-level data sources is the ability to execute brand and creative planning that is much more informed, not to mention more engaging—Merkle's PAM clients are seeing 30 percent increases in engagement and conversion rates. Fidelity makes it possible to better leverage CRM and wider PII-based matching and targeting across a growing number of digital media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Google and YouTube. And as addressable video and TV buying accelerates, we also see this model as a competitive advantage. High-fidelity advertising is no simple task. It requires organizations to seriously reconsider their strategy as well as their technology. CMOs need to unite their disparate data groups, bringing together CRM with communications, media strategy and planning. But the effort is worth it. Done right, advertisers can execute more precise, influential campaigns, and publishers can enjoy greater monetization of their premium inventory. You just have to unlock the data and stay focused on people, not proxies.

According to a recent survey by Marketing Week, 26 percent of marketers report there are no people from ethnic minorities in their team, while 27 percent said there were no lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender people and 51 percent that their departments lacked people with physical or mental disabilities.   Yet Procter & Gamble’s European brand boss Sophie Blum insists diversity is a “game changer” and key to her own company’s business success.   Speaking specifically about gender diversity after her talk at the Dmexco ad tech conference in Germany recently, she cites figures showing that P&G recruits a 50/50 gender balance, while 45 percent of its managers are female and women make up 40 percent of its board, according to Marketing Week.   She suggests diversity is not something new and that it has required a “long-lasting investment in culture” to achieve.   “Diversity is a measure, inclusion is a skill. The skill requires culture and it’s a topic for everyone. It is about creating this balance,” she told Marketing Week.   “Leveraging diversity on background, gender, ethnicity is a recipe for happiness and unleashing the potential of the personal and professional life. Since I joined P&G, [diversity] was very anchored in the business strategy and it is proven that diversity delivers better results.”   Read about her thoughts on marketing’s diversity problem and more in the full article here.

The study finds that women fall behind early and face ever-greater challenges the more senior they become. Women are less likely to receive the first critical promotion to manager—so far fewer end up on the path to leadership—and they are less likely to be hired into more senior positions. As a result, the higher you look in companies, the fewer women you see. "When women are stuck, corporate America is stuck," said Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook COO and founder of LeanIn.Org. "We know that diverse teams perform better and inclusive workplaces are better for all employees, so we all have strong incentives to get this right." The Women in the Workplace 2016 report is part of an ongoing partnership between McKinsey & Company and LeanIn.Org to give companies the information they need to promote female leadership and foster gender equality in the workplace. The study is based on pipeline data and information on human resources practices from 132 companies that employ more than 4.6 million people, including Visa, MetLife, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Procter & Gamble, Facebook, and General Motors. In addition, more than 34,000 employees completed a survey designed to explore their experiences regarding gender, opportunity, career, and work-life issues. The study builds on the Women in the Workplace 2015 report and a baseline study of sixty companies conducted by McKinsey & Company in 2012. "To accelerate progress on gender parity, we first must understand what is holding women back," said Dominic Barton, global managing partner of McKinsey & Company. "This study seeks to do exactly that. It provides companies with both industry benchmarks and data on their own talent pipeline and employees' work experiences. These insights will help companies drive bolder and more effective solutions." Contrary to conventional wisdom, this year's study found that women negotiate for promotions and raises as often as men, but face pushback when they do. They are far more likely than men who negotiate to receive feedback that they are "intimidating," "too aggressive," or "bossy." Women also receive informal feedback less frequently than men—despite asking for it as often—and have less access to senior-level sponsors. So not surprisingly, women are almost three times more likely than men to think their gender will make it harder to get a raise, promotion, or chance to get ahead. The study found that, compared to white women, women of color face the most barriers and experience the steepest drop-offs with seniority despite having higher aspirations for becoming a top executive. Women of color also report they get less access to opportunities and see a workplace that is less fair and inclusive. They are 9% less likely to say they've received a challenging new assignment, 21% less likely to think the best opportunities go to the most deserving employees, and 10% less likely to feel comfortable being themselves as work. Although company commitment to gender diversity is at an all-time high, companies are struggling to put their commitment into practice. Less than half of employees say their company is doing what it takes to improve diversity, and many employees do not see gender diversity as a personal priority. The report identifies concrete steps companies can take to advance their gender diversity efforts. They can make a stronger case for gender diversity, explaining why it matters and how it benefits everyone. They can also ensure their hiring, promotion, and performance review polices are fair, and invest in training so employees know the steps they can take to promote gender diversity. And they can place more emphasis on accountability and set gender targets so it's easier to track and make progress. The complete Women in the Workplace 2016 report, including detailed findings and recommendations, is available at womenintheworkplace.com. From the website, organizations can download the report and sign up to participate in this ongoing research. QUOTES FROM PARTICIPATING CEOS Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co."At JPMorgan Chase, we foster a diverse and inclusive workplace where everyone can thrive. We believe it's not only the smart thing to do, it's the right thing to do and it's also good for business. We've implemented a number of initiatives aimed at helping make sure women advance and achieve their career goals at our company. This study will help us continue to build on the momentum we've attained." Charles Scharf, CEO of Visa"At Visa, advancing diversity and inclusion is a strategic imperative. Data from this Women in the Workplace study has reaffirmed the reality that there is still a lot more work to be done in both investing in and advancing women in the workplace. Dialogue is critical, along with swift action. As one of several initiatives we have in place to advance this discussion, Visa recently joined a consortium that brings together companies who are as committed as we are to addressing the issues around equal pay to ensure the right questions are being asked." David Taylor, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Procter & Gamble"We aspire to create a better world for everyone—a world free of gender bias with equal representation and an equal voice for women and men. This begins inside our own company, where we're striving for equal representation for women and men at all levels and building an inclusive culture where everyone can contribute to their full potential. We seek insights that can shed light and inspire action to achieve gender equality—inside our workplace and more broadly in the world." KEY FINDINGS For every 100 women promoted to manager, 130 men are promotedPromotion rates for women lag behind those of men, and the disparity is the largest at the first step up to manager. As a result, far fewer women end up on the path to leadership. Very few women are in line to become CEOBy the time women reach the SVP level, they hold just 20% of line roles, and line roles lead more directly to the C-suite: In 2015, 90% of new CEOs in the S&P 500 were promoted or hired from line roles. Women experience an uneven playing fieldWomen get less access to the people and opportunities that advance careers and are disadvantaged in many of their daily interactions. These inequities appear to take a toll on women: They are less likely to think they have equal opportunities for growth and development—and more likely to think their gender will play a role in missing out on a raise, promotion, or chance to get ahead. Women of color have higher leadership aspirations, but face more barriers Compared to white women, women of color have higher aspirations to become a top executive but get less access to opportunities for growth and advancement. They also see a workplace that is less fair and inclusive. In all cases, Black women appear to be the most disadvantaged. Women are negotiating as often as men—but face pushback when they do Women who negotiate for a promotion or compensation increase are 30% more likely than men who negotiate to receive feedback that they are "bossy," "too aggressive," or "intimidating." Women get less access to senior leadersWomen and men both view sponsorship by senior leaders as essential for success. Yet women report fewer substantive interactions with senior leaders than their male counterparts do—and this gap widens as women and men advance. Women ask for feedback as often as men—but are less likely to receive itDespite asking for informal feedback as often as men do, women report they receive it less frequently. Moreover, there appears to be a disconnect in the way managers convey difficult feedback. Most managers say they rarely hesitate to give difficult feedback to both women and men, but women report they receive it less frequently.   Women are less interested in becoming top executives—and see the pros and cons of senior leadership differentlyOnly 40% of women are interested in becoming top executives, compared to 56% of men. Women and men worry equally about work-life balance and company politics. However, women with and without children are more likely to say they don't want the pressure, and women who want a top job anticipate a steeper path than men who do. Companies are highly committed to gender diversity, but struggling to put it into practiceLess than half of employees think their company is doing what it takes to improve gender diversity. In addition, less than a third of employees say senior leaders regularly communicate the importance of gender diversity and are held accountable for making progress. There are steps companies can take to promote gender equalityAlthough there's no "one size fits all" solution, the report identifies steps companies can take to advance gender equality: make a compelling case for gender diversity; ensure hiring, promotions, and reviews are fair; invest in more employee training; and focus on accountability and results.

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ MUMBAI: Procter & Gamble global chief executive David Taylor on Tuesday met Prime minister Narendra Modi to discuss manufacturing initiatives by the world's largest consumer goods firm in India and partnership opportunities in education and clean India movement. Taylor joined the maker of Ariel and Pampers a year ago amid falling global sales and restructuring of its product portfolio. In India too, it is de-prioritizing several unprofitable lines of business, which has impacted short-term top line growth rates. While it posted high-single-digit sales growth in the June quarter in segments that are strategically important for the company, rest of its local businesses, which account for about 15 per cent of its overall portfolio, shrank 35 per cent. "We reinforced our commitment to sustainability and agreed to partner with the Indian government on the Clean India initiative to protect the environment and reduce waste to landfill. We also reaffirmed our mutual goal to improve the lives of women and children. Overall, it was an exciting meeting and we were proud to be able demonstrate P&G’s commitment to this dynamic and fast growing country," Taylor in a statement said. P&G invested more than Rs 2,000 crore in India in the past three years, mainly to set up manufacturing units to reduce dependence on pricier imports. At present, it has seven manufacturing facilities in six states which account for more than 90 per cent of our products they sell in the Indian subcontinent. The strategy in India has been paying off - profit margins are up 750 basis points and the company has gone from losing significant money in India to triple-digit profits in last two years. In line with P&G’s global sustainability goals, P&G said it has offered to help Clean India by bringing down a technology to reduce waste to landfill that will up-cycle sanitary waste.

He joins the agency following a year and a half as a senior level integrated strategy and business stewardship consultant with S.I.N.K. Consulting in Brooklyn. Before that he spent two years with Publicis’ PKT and MSLGROUP as senior vice president, integrated/digital/social strategy, working with clients such as P&G and L’Oreal-Garnier. Kraft’s previous agency jobs include a stint as senior group strategy consultant with Grey New York, where he worked with brands including the NFL, Pantene, Downy, TJ Maxx and Goya, and a senior strategy director role at Leo Burnett. He also brings client-side experience to the Vitro gig: for three years he was CMO for Real Club Resorts, or “Mexico’s largest domestic beach hotel group in Cancun, Playa del Carmen and Tulum.” Kraft has also worked as an adjunct professor and advisor at NYU’s School of Professional Studies.  The appointment comes after Vitro won AOR duties on Adidas Golf at the beginning of the summer; that news followed the departures of executive creative directors Kt Thayer and Oliver Duncan a month prior. Earlier this year, ASICS shifted its global creative business to 180 Amsterdam and 180LA from the agency and Vitro opened a new office in Austin, hiring GSD&M’s Jake Camozzi and Victor Camozzi to run its creative department. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Social Media Computers & Laptops Mobiles & Tablets Other Gadgets ​L&T Technology Services to focus on top 30, adjacent customers Rajesh Kurup   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Keshab Panda, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, LTTS Mumbai, Sept 28:   L&T Technology Services Ltd (LTTS), Larsen & Toubro’s engineering and research and development arm, is to focus more on its top 30 customers who contribute 65 per cent of its revenues. The company will also concentrate on adjacent companies that work in the same space as its clients. This is under the company’s policy, T-30 and A-3, which came into effect in April 2016, LTTS Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Keshab Panda told BusinessLine​ in an interview. LTTS revenues from T-30 accounts stood at 65 per cent of the total in FY16, which is expected to grow at the same or a higher pace this year, he said, declining to provide “futuristic” statements. Some of the top customers for LTTS are Danaher, Scania, UTC, P&G, John Deere and BMW, among others, according to the Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP) filed with market regulator SEBI. The company has developed Internet of Things (IoT) solutions such as UbiqWeise and iBEMS in emerging technology areas to support its customers, Panda said. LTTS has also tied up with Intel as its go-to-market partner for its smart buildings platform, iBEMS, which enables Net-Zero, energy generation management, predictive and preventive maintenance to help steer-away from energy consumption to energy generation and helps customers save up to 40 per cent of energy costs. Using UBIQWeise, LTTS has designed a smart connected thermostat that is WiFi capable and controls all aspects of indoor air leveraging IoT, cloud and mobility solutions. This solution has been rolled out in the North American market, Panda said. For the company, Europe and the US is about 80 per cent of the market, and these geographies are expected to grow on a revenue basis even though it could be steady on a percentage basis. The company is also looking at focusing more on Japan and Korea in Asia, he said, adding LTTS does “very little work” in West Asia, while exposure in the UK is close to zero. MONETISING PATENTS Further, LTTS has 168 patents of which 34 are owned by the company and 134 are co-authored with global clients. The company is also looking to monetise them. “We will look at monetising the patents, which are filed across different geographies.” However, he did not give a time line for the monetisation. LTTS debuted on September 23, following a $134-million initial public offering (IPO). The Rs 900-crore IPO of L&T Technology Services was oversubscribed 2.53 times during September 12-15. The price band for the offer was fixed at Rs 850-860. This is the second company from the L&T group to hit the market with an IPO since July, when L&T Infotech had launched a public offer. The flagship Larsen and Toubro is already listed.

Sections Deseret NewsOpinion Opinion Derek B. Miller: Utah lost Facebook but can still save face By Derek B. MillerFor the Deseret News Published: Sept. 28, 2016 12:10 a.m. Updated: Sept. 27, 2016 7:23 p.m. 5 Comments In case you missed it amidst the status updates, news feed, likes, photos and pokes, Facebook has made its long-awaited decision. The company that created modern social networking and connected the world in ways heretofore unknown will build its massive data center in New Mexico, not Utah. The project had the potential to bring up to $1.5 billion in capital investment to Utah and would have joined a long list of notable companies that have moved to the Beehive State, including Proctor & Gamble, Adobe, Goldman Sachs, eBay, Boeing and many more. In the corporate recruitment world where success begets success and reputation matters, this loss has consequences. In the long run, there are lessons to be learned that if ignored will produce an even greater loss. The first lesson is it’s better to risk losing a recruitment project than to become the casualty of a bidding war of incentives between competing locations. Some decry the use of any incentives from state and local governments. There is no doubt that in an economist’s utopia, incentives would be unnecessary, but we don't live in that perfect world. The reality is states compete for the jobs and investment that come with corporate recruitment projects. In a free market, companies have choices on where to do business, and the resulting competition means states that want to attract jobs must produce a skilled workforce, stable business environment and high quality of life. This healthy competition goes off track when locations get into an incentives bidding war. We saw this beginning to happen when New Mexico sweetened an already enticing offer of 100 percent tax rebate with an additional $10 million subsidy. A state with strong "natural" incentives of well-educated employees, low taxes and reasonable regulations should not have to play that kind of game when recruiting companies. If a state wins every recruitment project, it is an indication that the financial incentives may be too rich. Losing a project now and then helps a state to be reflective and refine the incentives process. The second lesson is incentive parameters must be determined before negotiations begin. It is risky to try to figure out how far is too far during the heat of the moment, when emotions are heightened and the party sitting across the table can get the better of you. The Facebook recruitment clearly suffered from internal disagreement on how much incentive was acceptable. The city made an offer. The county disagreed. And the school board approved something in the middle. Having your internal negotiations play out in the public forum is not an effective way to win deals. For any company looking to relocate, no amount of financial incentive is ever enough. By nature the company will always want more. This is why it is important to have parameters set on your side of the table before you start negotiating. The third lesson is all partners must get and stay on the same page. There's no shame in losing a recruitment project when it becomes a "dialing for dollars" exercise and the company is simply searching for the highest bidder. Losing a project because of internal misunderstandings is a different matter, especially when it spills onto the front page of the paper. Elected and community leaders in Utah rightly tout our economic development “secret sauce” as our willingness to cooperate and ability to collaborate. Utah’s secret sauce has produced a long string of great results under the leadership of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, supported by the Economic Development Corporation of Utah, in coordination with local counties and cities. The Facebook project was an unfortunate loss but gratefully a rare exception. Learning from the loss will help ensure this exception does not become a pattern. Derek B. Miller is the president and CEO of the World Trade Center Utah. Previously he was chief of staff to Gov. Gary Herbert and managing director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development. 5 Comments Like that? Read this.

American botanist Luther Burbank once said flowers make people happier and more helpful. They are sunshine, he said, as well as food and medicine for the soul. Marilyn Johnson Aardema might just be the personification of that. The retired Procter & Gamble scientist took early retirement seven years ago at the very young age of 50 to do, well, what so many of us only dream of. She wanted to do something completely different without having to do it. She wished to bring joy to others. Her other requirement: Have a blast and be surrounded by beauty. And, get this, she didn’t need – nor does she really want – to make money at it. The idea, which she read about somewhere, seemed so simple that she was certain someone here was doing it: recycle wedding arrangements into smaller bouquets to give to nonprofits. She figured she would volunteer for the folks doing that here. Except “they” weren’t. “It was just such a no-brainer idea,” Johnson Aardema said in the sitting area of her home that overlooks lovely shade gardens and woods tucked into a northern suburb. Marilyn Johnson Aardema  (Photo: Provided) So she took matters into her own hands and reached out to another woman, who also shifted careers in her 50s, for a bit of advice both about taking a life leap and the art of floral arranging. First, Robin Wood, the owner of Evanston-based Robin Wood Flowers, told her she wasn’t crazy. Second, she told her it was a great idea. And finally, she said she would help promote it. With that, ReBloom was born, turning something old into something new again. Instead of dumping literally tens of thousands of dollars of exquisite floral arrangements in a dumpster after a wedding reception – which is generally what happens – some area brides opt to use ReBloom and have Johnson Aardema or her volunteers pick up their flowers and repurpose them. Buy Photo A cart full of flowers wait by the loading dock of the Cincinnati Art Museum Saturday, September 24, 2016. The flowers were used at a wedding the previous evening and will be repurposed as part of ReBloom, a volunteer organization in partnership with Robin Wood Flowers that repurposes donated flowers after weddings and delivers them to hospital patients and other nonprofit organizations in Greater Cincinnati.  (Photo: The Enquirer/Meg Vogel) The brides can write off a portion of their floral expense – which can run between $5,000 to $20,000 and as high as $50,000 or $60,000 – as a tax-deductible contribution. Wood, the former WEBN-FM (102.7) morning radio host and Channel 12 reporter turned floral-artist-businesswoman, is the connector: She mentions ReBloom to brides when they hire her to design and decorate for their wedding and reception. Wood then leaves it to the brides and Johnson Aardema to do the rest. “All that money, all that beauty. It’s really great when she is able to do this,” Wood said. Johnson Aardema, 57, and her tiny team of volunteers – her adult daughter, her dad and a few friends – arrange a pickup time for the flowers. From there, she heads home with plastic bins overflowing with luscious greens, roses bursting open, and dahlias, hydrangea and multiple varieties of exotic flowers at their peak. She or her volunteer, Cathleen Fagan, then pull apart the centerpieces and huge displays, snip the stems and pull off any browning vegetation and reassemble them into their own works of living art. And while they save dozen of flowers, some still end up in the dumpster because stems are too short to re-vase and some, if a venue hasn’t put them in a cooler overnight, have already started to wilt. But most recycled arrangements look great for at least three to five more days, she said. Her little business makes only enough money to pay for her gasoline, supplies and the thrift-store vases that she refuses to pay more than 69 cents for by the way. She operates out of a corner of her garage. And that’s how she likes it. Wood said most brides love the idea. But because ReBloom is a tiny enterprise, it is often difficult to match the reception dates to volunteer availability, as Johnson Aardema’s consulting business often takes her out of town. She estimated ReBloom will do about 10-13 weddings a year. Wood said she could easily send more business to her, if Johnson Aardema could handle it. “It’s a small kind of thing,” she said. “I really want to keep it interesting and fun.” She and her daughter take their ReBloom arrangements in the lobby of Mercy Health-Fairfield Hospital, which is near her home. They used to deliver the arrangements directly to patient rooms. But now, they greet empty-handed visitors with the flowers. “It is just instant gratification,” she said. “This way we bring joy to the person who picks up the flowers and then get the joy of giving them to their patient.” Buy Photo Cathleen Fagan fills new vases to make repurposed arrangements as part of ReBloom. Fagan usually delivers to the 15 residents who live in Elm Street Senior Housing in Over-the-Rhine.  (Photo: The Enquirer/Meg Vogel) Fagan, who lives Downtown and is active is several Over-the-Rhine nonprofits, takes the flowers to her rooftop terrace to do her arranging – usually on Sunday morning – and delivers them to about 15 residents living in Elm Street Senior Housing. All the recipients are delighted with the arrangements. But one woman who battled cancer for years and received one of the ReBloom arrangements at the hospital holds a special place in Johnson Aardema’s heart. Years later, she died and her husband contacted Johnson Aardema to carry out his wife’s wish: She wanted the sprays from her funeral to be repurposed for others at the hospital. They met in the parking lot of Kohl’s. They hugged. She cried. Then she took the flowers and got to work.

The MMA Marketing Attribution Think Tank (MATT) is backed by 24 of the trade body's members, including Allstate, Bank of America, 1-800Flowers.com, Procter & Gamble, The Coca-Cola Company and Unilever. Its first initiative will be to look at multi-touch attribution (MTA) – the "Holy Grail" for the industry. "It likely is the biggest thing mobile marketers will ever take on," Greg Stuart, CEO of the MMA, said in describing MATT's mission. "We need to rethink what we're doing with the billions of dollars that we are spending on behalf of shareholders to invest in building a business or a brand. And we do not have the tools to do that today. "So we are going to seek to give marketers better measurements, better tools, and, most importantly, the confidence to apply some of these next-generation measurement tools, in effect connecting marketing to business outcomes. Because that is what has been missing." Many marketers, Stuart continued, lack the knowledge and experience to make sense of the current landscape, not least because there are a huge number of vendors offering many different modeling solutions. The 20 providers assessed in detail by the MMA, for instance, used 25 separate techniques. In response, MATT's goal will be to "help marketers to select the right partner for them to work with, the right MTA provider, and apply that with confidence to their business," Stuart explained. As further support for this objective, the MMA found that the marketers already using MTA gave it a -35 Net Promoter Score, a figure that Stuart compared with the -10 registered by budget motel chain Motel 6. "So we have a lot of work to do," he stated. "We're really going to dig in and pull apart this whole category, and really look at the whole landscape — find areas where we can provide clarity, find ways where we can do validation, find ways where we can test lift, find ways where we can write standards to give you the confidence to go and do this." MATT's aims to bring together the many providers to find a better way forward for clients were welcomed by Sanjay Gupta, EVP/marketing, innovation and corporate relations at insurer Allstate, one of the backers of the project. "The truth is we can all benefit from better tool sets," he said. "It still doesn't make it equal from a marketing standpoint, because what works for me may not work for my competitor. "So we will try to build edges, but I don't think too many marketers believe the tool set itself will give them an edge."

For every 100 women who get promoted from an entry-level position to manager, 130 men advance, according to the study released Tuesday by  LeanIn.org and McKinsey & Co. Women lag behind men at every step, but the gap is largest at the critical point when they first could move into leadership. “Women are hitting the glass ceiling earlier than people realize,” said Rachel Thomas, president of LeanIn, a group founded by Facebook Inc. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. “Men are off to the races and women are starting to see hurdles right out of the gate.” The study looked at employee pipelines at 132 companies, including General Motors Co., Visa Inc., Procter & Gamble Co. and Morgan Stanley. It also surveyed 34,000 employees. Women asked for promotions or raises slightly more frequently than men, and were more likely to be labeled “bossy” or “aggressive” when they did, the study found. Women also got less access to senior leaders than men, less advice on how to improve their work and fewer high-profile assignments. “Those things start to add up,” Thomas said. “Women progress more slowly, and the higher you look, the fewer women you see.” HR Nudge One reason may be that as they move up, many women shift from line roles, where they’re responsible for a profit-and-loss statement, to staff positions, such as human resources or information technology. Those jobs are less likely to lead to the CEO suite. It could be that women are nudged into those careers, Thomas said, or that they lack role models in line positions. Women make up less than 5 percent of the CEOs of the 500 largest U.S. public companies, according to Catalyst, an advocacy group for female executives. The disparities are most pronounced for women of color, who make up 20 percent of the U.S. population but just 3 percent of C-suite positions. While 78 percent of companies reported that gender diversity was a top 10 priority for their CEO, up from about 56 percent in 2012, only 55 percent said racial diversity was a high priority. But there is some cause for optimism, Thomas said. The study showed a slight increase in the percentage of women at each level compared with a year ago.  Another factor holding women back was partners who failed to share the burden of housework and child rearing, the study said. Among women who share housework equally with their partners, 43 percent aspired to senior executive jobs. Only 34 percent of those who did most of the housework wanted the same, the study said.

Taft's Ale House opening a second location Shauna Steigerwald , ssteigerwald@enquirer.com 2:59 p.m. EDT September 27, 2016 Taft's Brewing Company will be at 4831 Spring Grove Ave. in Spring Grove Village. (Photo: Provided) Taft's Ale House is pouring $6 million into a second location. Taft's Brewing Company, 4831 Spring Grove Ave. in Spring Grove Village, will be a production facility and also house a 3,000-square-foot "Brewpourium" tap room and beer garden. The owners hope to open as soon as the April 3, the Cincinnati Reds' Opening Day, but no later than May 1. The 50,000-square-foot building at the corner of Mitchell and Spring Grove is the former P&G Mitchell Lab. Historically, the site was used to house trolley cars, according to Taft's Ale House head brewer and partner Kevin Moreland. His partners in both locations are Dave Kassling and Dave Williams. The owners said they're still working through final design plans for the site, which is located about 10 minutes north of the current location in Over-the-Rhine. But the project has the same designer as that original space, so  "there will definitely be similarities to the design of Taft's Ale House, while maintaining the industrial feel," Kassling said. "There's a total 'wow' factor when you walk into Taft's Ale House. We want to create a 'wow' factor that hasn't been seen at a production brewery." But don't expect the new site to be a carbon copy of the original, which opened on Opening Day 2015. "They will definitely be distinctly different experiences," Kassling said. That includes what will be on tap, as the Brewpourium may offer beers that aren't available in Over-the-Rhine. Also unlike at Taft's Ale House, where food is a major focus, Taft's Brewing Company doesn't have a kitchen on site. Kassling said they're still exploring options for how they might make food available to customers there. The owners declined to say exactly how much beer the new location will produce but said that it will allow the company to meet local demand and expand elsewhere in the region, things it currently can't do. Moreland said Taft's Ale House beer is already in about 170 locations in cans or on draft, but the production facility will allow them to grow that number as well as to can more beers. Which beer the new facility will produce first is still up in the air: The owners are letting Taft's Ale House visitors vote. Kassling and Moreland said the second location is all about long-term growth. "Assuming we're going to continue to grow and expand the way we want to, the space will be able to accommodate our growth for a long time coming," Kassling said. 759 CONNECTTWEET 4 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2dhzoph

(REUTERS/Marcelo del Pozo) Share Written by Oliver Staley September 27, 2016 It’s 2016 and opportunities for women in the workplace have improved, right? Think again. A new report from McKinsey & Co. and Lean In, the organization founded by Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg, shows that women are still struggling to advance. For every 100 women promoted past entry level positions, 130 men are promoted. Women are less likely to receive challenging assignments, participate in meetings and have access to senior leaders. And the pipeline of promotion shows women are being passed over at every stage (men and women are dropping out of the workplace at equal rates, so the numbers can’t be blamed on attrition): To compile its study, McKinsey used data from 132 US companies, representing 4.6 million workers at companies like Visa, General Motors and Proctor & Gamble. It also conducted a survey of 34,000 employees to get a more nuanced view of their experiences at work. The survey revealed that more women then men asked for a raise, 29% to 27%, but that in response, 30% of women were told that they were being “bossy,” “aggressive,” or “intimidating,” compared to 23% of men. Women also say they receive less feedback from managers than men. While 46% of men say they receive difficult feedback, only 36% of women do. Managers say the biggest reason they fail to give women feedback is a fear of being mean or hurtful. The results are even starker for women of color, who reported seeing fewer opportunities than white women across the board. There’s an increasing body of evidence that gender equity is achieved not by creating what appear to be gender neutral policies, but by companies actively working to make sure their procedures are free of bias and give women equal opportunities. Employers should rethink how they advertise positions, how they screen resumes and how they interview to ensure they’re free of unconscious bias, says Iris Bohnet, a behavioral economist at Harvard, in her book What Works. Notably, less than half of the companies McKinsey examined require diverse slates of candidates for hiring and promotion, and only 56% review job descriptions to ensure they’re free of biased language. One easy procedure to weed out biases in hiring is using blind resume reviews—removing names and other details from resumes that indicate gender and race—but only 4% of companies say they do that. If the study reveals how much work is left to be done to create gender equality in the workplace, the good news is that so much of that work is not complicated or difficult, and many firms are already doing it.

Reprints Reprints Most Popular The Mobile Marketing Association (MMA) has assembled a think tank backed by more than 20 major marketers to fix what may be marketing's biggest problem: figuring out what really drives media success or failure. Credit: Mobile Marketing Association The MMA Marketing Attribution Think Tank (MATT) will "rethink the world of marketing measurement and attribution," according to the group. It's backed by executives from Procter & Gamble Co., Unilever, Nestle, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola Co., J.P. Morgan Chase, American Express, Mastercard, Bank of America, Samsung, T-Mobile, Hilton, Choice Hotels and 1-800-Flowers, among others. The group planned to introduce the initiative during its SM2 Innovation Conference in New York on Tuesday. The first initiative of MATT focuses on "multi-touch attribution" (MTA)which seeks to sort through the many factors that contribute to purchase decisions rather than simply attributing them to the last thing consumers did or saw before buying something. Over the past six months, the MMA has conducted a comprehensive look into the providers and market dynamics in MTA in partnership with the Marketing Science Institute and Joel Rubinson, former Advertising Research Foundation chief research officer and now president of Rubinson Partners. The review found many brands don't use MTA because of difficulty evaluating offerings from vendors, giving the approach a negative 35 Net Promoter score that reflects a lack of confidence. In a breakfast outlining the initiative Tuesday morning, MMA CEO Greg Stuart said the Net Promoter score for Motel 6 was a relatively good minus 10, well ahead of the score for MTA firms. "So you'd really rather stay at Motel 6 than deal with multi-touch attribution?" he said, jokingly. Related Stories 25 Largest U.S. Mobile Marketing Agencies Startup SessionM in Bid to Become Salesforce of Mobile Marketing Marketers Are Failing to Create Trust, Value in Mobile Marketing "Rather than living in a world where the last touch gets all the attribution, we as marketers need to understand what the combination does," said Sanjay Gupta, exec VP-marketing, innovation and corporate relations of Allstate, one of the backers of the project. Many companies have pursued solutions on their own, he said. "But I think having the MMA bring multiple companies together to find the optimal way is extremely helpful." The project brings together numerous competitors, some of whom have traditionally felt they have a proprietary edge in analytics, to find industry solutions. "The truth is we can all benefit from better tool sets," Mr. Gupta said. "It still doesn't make it equal from a marketing standpoint, because what works for me may not work for my competitor. So we will try to build edges, but I don't think too many marketers believe the tool set itself will give them an edge." The effort is unlikely to quickly produce a single silver bullet to slay all the industry's analytics woes, Mr. Gupta said. "It's a complex problem, not one where six months later there will be an 'Aha!' moment. But it's much needed."

In addition to this most recent accolade, Leo Burnett has been honored by the Chicago Tribune as a "Top Workplace" consecutively since 2013, the only creative agency to place within the top 25 on that list. This past year, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation recognized Leo Burnett as a "Best Place to Work for LGBT Equality," receiving a perfect score of 100 percent.

Revenue also beat forecasts, but the shares are under pressure as Nike reports future orders up a less-than-expected seven percent. Wells Fargo — Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf will forfeit $41 million in equity awards following the recent sales scandal, while former community banking head Carrie Tolstedt will give up $19 million in equity awards. BlackBerry — BlackBerry reported a breakeven quarter, surprising analysts who had expected a five cents per share loss. Revenue was well below forecasts, however, and the maker of mobile phone software also announced the departure of its chief financial officer, James Yersh. Deutsche Bank — CEO John Cryan told a German newspaper that the bank did not need any government assistance or a capital increase. The shares have been under pressure on worries that an anticipated multibillion-dollar fine from the U.S. Justice Department could damage the bank's finances. AT&T — UBS downgraded the stock to "neutral" from "buy," pointing to lower earnings growth and increasing competition in the wireless business. Tempur Sealy — Tempur Sealy cut its 2016 outlook, with the mattress company saying sales for the current quarter are coming in below expectations. Macy's — The retailer's shares were downgraded to "neutral" from "outperform" at Credit Suisse, saying Macy's is now in an "execution phase" of a strategic shift and that investors are likely to wait to see results. Twitter — Mizuho downgraded Twitter to "underperform" from "neutral" on a valuation basis, saying it was skeptical about most of the takeover rumors circulating through Wall Street. Alphabet — Wedbush downgraded the Google parent's stock to "underperform" from "neutral," on a variety of concerns about future monetization of online search. Cintas — Cintas earned an adjusted $1.26 per share for its latest quarter, 17 cents a share above estimates. The uniform maker's revenue was slightly above forecasts. The company also raised its full-year forecast, as sales improved for both its uniform rental business and its facility services unit. Sonic — The fast food chain projected current-quarter earnings below current Wall Street consensus, citing slower customer traffic and lower spending at its restaurants. Coty — Coty will replace Diamond Offshore in the S&P 500, which is moving to the S&P MidCap 400. Coty, a maker of beauty and fragrance products, is in the process of buying a chunk of Procter & Gamble's beauty business, and its stock will join the S&P 500 after the close of trading on Friday. ABInBev — The beer brewer's shareholders have approved its $100 billion takeover of rival SABMiller, and SABMiller shares have done the same in separate votes today. SAP — SAP will invest $2.2 billion in "Internet of Things"-related investments through the end of 2020. Europe's biggest software maker wants to take advantage of an estimated $280 billion market. Royal Bank of Scotland — RBS will pay $1.1 billion to resolve U.S. claims involving mortgage-backed securities that it sold to credit unions ahead of the 2008 financial crisis.

He was in Cleveland urging people to get out and vote for Hillary Clinton. (Joshua Gunter, cleveland.com) By  Jeremy Pelzer, cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Email the author Follow on Twitter on September 28, 2016 at 6:20 AM Print Email Bill Clinton campaigns for his wife in Cleveland and Toledo. Donald Trump highlights Ohio's economic "devastation." And Rob Portman's campaign gets tech-savvy. Today's Ohio Politics Roundup is brought to you by Jeremy Pelzer.    Bill Clinton campaigns in Cleveland: On the heels of Hillary Clinton's first presidential debate with Donald Trump, ex-President Bill Clinton visited Cleveland's Ginn Academy on Tuesday to pump up energy for his wife's campaign. Cleveland.com's Mary Kilpatrick has the story. Clinton lightly criticized free trade deals... Campaigning in Toledo earlier in the day, Clinton "acknowledged that the international trade deals have not always worked out as well as planned," according to the Toledo Blade's Tom Troy. Clinton, who signed NAFTA in 1993, "blamed poor enforcement and what he called things that happened outside the trade deal." ...while Trump's criticism may have gone too far: During the first presidential debate Monday, Trump offered Ohio as an example of how free-trade policies have created economic "devastation" and sent American jobs overseas. But as Chrissie Thompson of the Cincinnati Enquirer writes, Ohio's reality "is far more nuanced." While Ohio has lost manufacturing jobs, overall employment in the state has steadily climbed since 2010 – though, on the other hand, non-manufacturing jobs tend to pay less.  Ohio shout-out: Trump's repeated name-dropping of Ohio during the debate was no accident, explains the Dayton Daily News' Jessica Wehrman – the GOP nominee appealed directly to anti-free trade voters in a state he feels he can win. But as Mark Caleb Smith of Cedarville University told Wehrman, such talk could also alienate well-educated suburban mothers and those still on the fence. For more analysis of Monday's debate: Check out a Facebook Live discussion with cleveland.com politics reporters Henry J. Gomez and Andrew J. Tobias. What did you think of the debate? If you live in Cuyahoga County, take our post-debate Battleground Cuyahoga poll. As cleveland.com's Mary Kilpatrick notes, cleveland.com and Baldwin Wallace University asked the same questions before the debate, and we want to see what's changed. Coal country digs Trump: "Southeastern Ohio, which has been slowly turning away from Democrats, appears poised to back Donald Trump and his talk on trade, manufacturing jobs and coal," reports the Columbus Dispatch's Jim Siegel. "Trump nearly swept the region over Gov. John Kasich in the Republican primary in March, and he appears headed for a repeat against Hillary Clinton — who seemingly would appeal to traditional working-class voters." Nerd alert: The Associated Press' Julie Carr Smyth has an interesting look at how U.S. Sen. Rob Portman's campaign has taken advantage of digital technology, from data mining to online ads. Portman's well-funded campaign has used voter databases and online ads early and often, allowing it to tailor ads to individual voters and win over hard-to-reach younger viewers. Bad news for Strickland, part 1: The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has canceled another week's worth of TV ad reservations on behalf of Democratic Senate nominee Ted Strickland, according to the Columbus Dispatch's Jack Torry. The move, which follows similar DSCC cancellations in recent weeks, means the DSCC only has ads booked for Strickland for the final two weeks before Election Day.  Bad news for Strickland, part 2: Meanwhile, pundit Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics has moved Ohio's U.S. Senate race rating from "Likely Republican" to "Safe Republican," noting Portman has a "massive resource advantage" and that Ted Strickland "has largely flamed out as a candidate." Power politics: Gov. John Kasich, speaking in Texas, again threatened to veto legislation that would kill the state's renewable-energy and energy-efficiency mandates, reports The Plain Dealer's John Funk. Kasich: "If you try to kill the standards, whether it has to do with the renewables or whether it has to do with the issue of saving energy, I'll veto the bill and we'll go to the higher standards." Sen. Bill Seitz of Cincinnati and other GOP lawmakers have sought to permanently end the mandates, which are currently frozen but will resume Jan. 1 unless lawmakers pass another bill. Statehouse popularity contest results are in: and Ohio's top legislative leaders didn't fare too well. As cleveland.com's Jackie Borchardt explains, a Columbus Monthly survey of more than 100 Capitol Square denizens found that Senate President Keith Faber won such dubious accolades as "most humorless" and "most arrogant," while House Speaker Cliff Rosenberger "barely registered" in the anonymous survey. Lawmakers who won top praise included state Sen. Bill Seitz (savviest, funniest, most knowledgeable, and best orator) and state Rep. Ryan Smith (most effective, hardest working, and tied for best listener). Water fight stops spending bill: Government authority to spend money will end Friday after the U.S. Senate rejected a stop-gap bill to provide funding into early December, writes cleveland.com's Steve Koff.  "The hangup Tuesday resulted from Democrats' demands that the continuing resolution include money for Flint, Michigan; Sebring, Ohio and other communities affected by dangerous levels of lead in their drinking water." But Senate offices said they were confident there will be no federal shutdown, which would reflect poorly on both parties as the November election approaches. Instead, lawmakers are likely to compromise on a short-term spending bill, or continuing resolution. Stop, in the name of jobs: "Some of Ohio's most prominent companies, including Procter & Gamble, Timken and Invacare, told President Barack Obama's administration today that regulations intended to crack down on corporate tax loopholes will harm businesses instead," Koff reports. The companies were among 47 corporations that wrote to Obama claiming that proposed rules to stop corporations from shifting their ownership to lower-tax companies – a so-called corporate inversion – "would significantly impede the ability of our businesses to invest and create jobs in Ohio." Tax tally: "The state of Ohio took in more tax money in 2015 than the previous year, but still ranks among the lowest taxing states," reports cleveland.com's Rich Exner. Each individual and corporation in Ohio, on average, paid $2,437 in state taxes and fees last year – 34th highest in the nation, and up about $100 per capita from 2014. Judge for yourself: If you're looking for information about judicial races this year, cleveland.com's Robert Higgs has the site for you: Judge4Yourself.com. The site, run by four Greater Cleveland bar associations, has info on candidates for Ohio Supreme Court and other state and county court seats. No Moore: Liberal filmmaker Michael Moore claims Newark's Midland Theater banned him from presenting a one-man show about the presidential race, according to the Dispatch's Jim Woods. Moore alleged theater management canceled his Oct. 7 show because they deemed him "too controversial." Theater management denied he was banned, though an official acknowledged they had "questions about potential controversy and the potential for disruptive events." Moore said he's arranged to hold his show early next month at another undisclosed venue in Southern Ohio.  Protests halt Columbus City Council meeting: Columbus City Council members evacuated their meeting Monday night after more than 100 protesters demanded justice for Tyre King, a 13-year-old killed by Columbus police, according to Rick Rouan of the Columbus Dispatch. The protesters' demands included ending a police summer safety initiative designed to target hot spots for crime, moving half of the city's police budget into other programs, and requiring independent investigations into police-involved shootings. The protests aren't helpful for Columbus City Council President Zach Klein, a rising Democratic star running for Franklin County prosecutor. Klein said after the meeting that he "share[s] their frustration that they feel sometimes that things don't go as fast as they want."

Story Continued Below Monday’s first presidential debate hit a lot of the key tax issues in this year’s campaign, from GOP nominee Donald Trump hitting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for raising taxes, Clinton hitting back that Trump’s relying on tired trickle-down philosophies — and, of course, that moment when Trump appeared to suggest that he doesn’t really pay income taxes. The Pro teams fact-checked a number of tax issues, but let’s start with those tax returns. After the debate, Trump told CNN that he wasn’t suggesting during the debate that he didn’t pay the Treasury. “I didn’t say that at all,” Trump said. “I do hate the way our government spends money.” (POLITICO's Sarah Wheaton goes into why people might have gotten that impression.) But then there's this: Hope Hicks, a Trump spokeswoman, told The Wall Street Journal that Trump was only referring to the years that it's already been confirmed that he didn't pay any income tax. As for actual tax policy, there were questions about how much money U.S. companies hold offshore (Trump overstated it), among other things. But big picture: Trump plugged his tax cuts, while Clinton was proudly behind her tax hikes on the rich. And that’s really not all that different from 2012, when President Barack Obama openly campaigned on tax hikes for the wealthy. That year’s GOP nominee, Mitt Romney, was calling for revenue-neutral tax reform, though there were questions about whether his plan could actually pull that off. SERIOUSLY, IT’S ONLY TUESDAY. It’s also been 426 years since Pope Urban VII died. The good news was he got to be pope. The bad news was he was only pope for less than two weeks before dying, the shortest tenure of all time. What’s going on out there? Email: bbecker@politico.com, teckert@politico.com, bfaler@politico.com, kodonnell@politico.com. Twitter: @berniebecker3, @tobyeckert, @brian_faler, @katyodonnell_ , @POLITICOPro and @Morning_Tax. CATS AND DOGS, DANCING TOGETHER: The liberal Citizens for Tax Justice released its own projections for Trump’s new tax plan on Monday, finding that 44 percent of the tax cuts would go to the top 1 percent and that the plan would cost anywhere from $4.8 trillion to $6.4 trillion over a decade. Bob McIntyre of CTJ said the price tag on the newest Trump plan might be trimmed, but it’s still “in the same spirit” as the original, $10 trillion-over-a-decade proposal. Interestingly enough, the conservative Tax Foundation came to similar conclusions (as pointed out by their own staffers) — at least when it came their score that didn’t try to account for economic growth. TRUMP AND CHILD CARE, CONT’D: Well, that paper asserting that Trump’s plan would hike taxes on families consisting of around 25 million parents and 15 million children — under a conservative estimate — certainly gained some more traction on Monday. Trump’s team has ridiculed the paper from Lily Batchelder of New York University, a former Democratic tax aide in both the Senate and the White House. But the Tax Foundation’s Kyle Pomerleau also said on Twitter on Monday that — following some back-of-the-envelope calculations — Batchelder’s conclusions looked reasonable. (The Trump campaign certainly has not been shy in plugging the Foundation’s findings on other parts of its tax plan.) And Harry Stein of the Center for American Progress digs down a little deeper on the numbers, noting the Trump camp’s own examples of how his plan would give a $93 tax cut to certain married couples with two children making $50,000 a year and a $1,083 tax cut to a married couple with two children making $75,000 a year. A single parent under similar circumstances, Stein maintains, would see a $340 tax increase when making $50,000 a year and a $1,140 tax increase at $75,000 in annual income. SCORE ONE FOR SCHUMER AND GRASSLEY: The IRS officially announced that four private debt collectors — two in New York and one apiece in California and Iowa — will start seeking certain overdue tax debts in spring 2017, as our Toby Eckert reports. Perhaps not surprisingly, Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) are big fans of the use of the debt collectors, which was inserted into last year’s highway bill. The IRS’s union, the national taxpayer advocate and other Democratic lawmakers are among the opponents of the change, noting that previous attempts to use private companies has turned out to be a money loser for the government. But Toby also notes there’s a particular concern about private debt collectors that the IRS didn’t have to worry about as much the last time — identity theft. The agency said Monday it would send multiple notices to taxpayers who are having their cases turned over to a collection agency, after warning for years against phone scams that can lead to return fraud. INTERESTING: Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey, a Democratic tax writer, is planning to introduce legislation that would be similar to the House GOP’s plan to tax imports, but not exports, according to Tax Analysts’ Dylan Moroses. Getting Democrats to buy in to key parts of their tax plan could be a boon to the GOP, especially as top lawmakers insist they’ll push for a tax reform vote in 2017. That said — one Democratic bill does not a movement make. FIRST LOOK: The lobbying over the Treasury Department’s earnings stripping regulations has migrated to the states as well. Dozens of Ohio companies and business groups — including Procter & Gamble, based in Cincinnati, and the discount retail chain Big Lots, headquartered in Columbus — are sending Treasury Secretary Jack Lew a letter today that says the proposed Section 385 rules are already hurting business in the Buckeye State. “The proposed regulations will complicate, and in some cases eliminate, our companies’ ability to self-finance our job growth and could obstruct access to capital,” the businesses and groups wrote. “The broad language of the regulations creates uncertainty resulting in serious hesitation to make long-term commitments in an already challenging business environment.” Rep. Pat Tiberi of Ohio, a senior Republican at House Ways and Means, piled on, too. “At some point, the administration will need to start listening to these substantial and serious concerns from businesses in my state and across the country,” he said. FIRST LOOK, PART DEUX: The Alliance for Competitive Taxation, one of several corporate coalitions pushing for tax reform, is piggybacking on last night's debate to stress the need to bring down both the effective and statutory corporate tax rate. The group cites a PricewaterhouseCoopers study that found that the effective tax rate here “was between 26 percent and 114 percent higher than the average for the comparison countries.” WE GOT 51! The Brewers Association announced Monday that it’s got a majority of the Senate behind the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act, as Pro Agriculture’s Catherine Boudreau reports. A majority of both chambers has now signed on to the measure, which would cut the excise tax on beer for smaller brewers, with the support in the Senate especially bipartisan — 26 Republicans and 25 Democrats. That includes a couple of former Senate Finance chairmen (Grassley and Ron Wyden) and the Senate Democrats’ next leader (Schumer). But as supporters of other measures can tell the craft brewers, having most of Congress with you doesn’t mean that your bill is going to get passed quickly. DRIP, DRIP, DRIP: The Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold is out with a new scoop on the Trump Foundation — apparently, the GOP nominee directed that at least $2.3 million worth of payments owed to him instead go to his foundation. That’s all well and fine, but Trump would still likely owe taxes on that money. His campaign told the Post that Trump paid taxes on a $400,000 portion of the $2.3 million, but declined comment on the rest. INTERNATIONAL UPDATE — UP CREEK, NO PADDLE: Apple’s not exactly lacking for money, yet still has a rather shoestring operation when it comes to lobbying in Europe — something The Wall Street Journal reports didn’t help the tech titan fend off that record $14.6 billion fine and won’t help with any appeal. Apple, the Journal notes, spent just around $1 million (900,000 euros) on lobbying the European Union last year, and has no full-time lobbyists on the continent. (That’s about a quarter of what companies like Google and Microsoft spent.) And here’s the upshot about how that might have influenced the European Commission’s decision that Apple’s tax agreements with Ireland constituted illegal state aid: “Apple was unsuccessful in gathering information over the last two years from the commission about the evolving theory the EU was resting its case on, said people familiar with the matter.” Related: Pascal Saint-Amans, who led the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Initiative, said Apple won’t necessarily be a precedent in Europe. FIGURING OUT FATCA: One of President Barack Obama’s signature achievements on battling tax evasion — the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act — has some holes that have left the financial sector worried with just months left in Obama’s tenure, Bloomberg BNA reports. The issue: More than 100 governments have signed pacts with the federal government, known as intergovernmental agreements (IGAs), that facilitate the sharing of information on Americans’ bank accounts with the IRS. But 49 countries haven’t finalized their agreements yet. Those pacts have either been signed or are being treated as in effect, but banks are still worried about moving forward with so many IGAs short of completely done. “A lot of financial institutions are nervous about what they'll do if countries get dropped off the list of IGAs,” said one expert. “They're exploring what they can do in a worst-case scenario.” STATE NEWS — ABOUT THAT TOBACCO TAX: This much is very clear about the upcoming California budget measure on tobacco — it would increase the price of a pack of cigarettes by $2, and tax e-cigarettes, as Kaiser Health News notes. What’s not so clear: Where will that money go? “It is estimated that up to $1 billion each year would go to ‘improved payments’ for Medi-Cal health care services — which proponents say will be parsed out democratically. But opponents say the health care funding is part of a ‘special interest tax grab.’” QUICK LINKS — Mylan understated its pretax EpiPen profits. — Treasury Secretary Jack Lew offers some tax exchange help to Argentina.

But it’s typically not accepted in North American recycling programs, which means that flexible packaging usually ends up in landfills. Considering the market for food and beverage flexible packaging is expected to exceed $83 billion by 2020, that’s a lot of plastic waste. New research from Resource Recycling Systems (RSS), however, shows flexible packaging can be captured in single-stream materials recovery facilities (MRF) with automated sorting technologies in use today. This could create a new stream of recovered materials while improving the quality of other recycling streams. The research was commissioned by Materials Recovery for the Future (MRFF), a collaborative of brand owners, manufacturers and packaging industry organizations that want to improve recycling and increase recovery rates for flexible film and packaging options. MRFF members include Amcor, Dow Chemical, LyondellBasell, Nestlé Purina PetCare and Nestlé USA, PepsiCo, Plum Organics, Procter & Gamble, SC Johnson, Sealed Air and Target as well as the Association for Postconsumer Plastic Recyclers, the Flexible Packaging Association, SPI: The Plastics Industry Trade Association and the American Chemistry Council. “Flexible packaging has many positive attributes — highly efficient, great product protection, and low environmental impact. However, recovery has been one of its weak points,” said Brad Rodgers, foods packaging research and development director for discovery and sustainability at PepsiCo, in a statement. “This study is shedding light on pathways that can be deployed to improve flexible packaging end-of-life options.” This first phase of the MRFF research program included baseline testing, equipment testing, and a series of recovery facility trials to test existing sortation technologies commonly used in MRFs, such as screens and optical scanners. RRS developed the test methodology and conducted the research trials. Subsequent research will focus on further refinements to sorting technology, economic feasibility, assessing end-use markets for the material, and developing a recovery facility demonstration project. The research follows MRFF member Dow’s launch of a new RecycleReady Technology that allows polyethylene-based barrier packaging to be recycled as part of existing grocery store drop-off recycling programs.

Just about every year at this time, I offer ratings — buy, neutral or sell — on the largest U.S. stocks. These giants aren't my meat and potatoes. My real sweet spot is in small- and mid-cap stocks. But I rate the behemoths because I know a lot of readers are interested; these stocks are widely owned. Apple Inc. (AAPL, $607 billion) is the largest U.S. stock by a mile. The company is highly profitable and has a mountain of cash. But the iPhone, its flagship product, may be slowing a little. Avoid. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT, $448 billion) is still a great company, but growth and profitability aren't as impressive as in the glory days. I recommended it in 2010-2013, but now I think its price is too high. Avoid. Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN, $382 billion) is a stock about which I've been consistently skeptical. I've been wrong, as sales and the stock price have soared. But all my experience tells me that paying 200 times earnings for a stock is insane. Avoid. Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM, $346 billion) is king of the energy business, which has been a troubled realm since mid-2014. The troubles aren't over, but I think the tide is slowly turning. Buy. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ, $325 billion) is a broadly diversified health-care company with a business model I admire. It's not especially popular with Wall Street's analysts today, but its profit margin has been expanding. Buy. Facebook Inc. (FB, $297 billion), one of the four popular “FANG” stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google), boasts rapid earnings growth as ad sales improve. It's popular with analysts, but I dislike it at 61 times recent earnings. Avoid. Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, $270 billion) is the proud parent of Google. I admire its innovations, its talent pool and its acquisitions. But valuations (31 times recent earnings, almost 7 times sales) keep me on the sidelines. Neutral. General Electric Co. (GE, $268 billion) has been reemphasizing its industrial roots. A year ago, I said I wanted to see how this strategy played out for the next 12 months. Results are mixed, so I want to wait longer. Neutral. AT&T Inc. (T, $254 billion) sports a 4.6 percent dividend yield. I like it for income-oriented investor. Buy. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) has shown only mediocre growth and profitability of late, but I have faith in the ability of CEO Jamie Diamond. Buy. Procter & Gamble Co. (PG, $234 billion) is a household word, but its 10-year revenue and earnings growth rates are near 1 percent. People are paying 24 times earnings for a stock that's solid but not growing much. Avoid. Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC, $231 billion) has the same problem all banks have. It's hard to earn a good spread on lending when interest rates are low. I think things will improve, but slowly. Neutral. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT, $224 billion) remains a leader in low-price retailing, but competitors have copied many of its innovations such as detailed computerized tracking of sales and inventory. Avoid. Verizon Communications (VZ, $214 billion) made a good move in my opinion by buying Internet portals AOL and Yahoo. However, I view it as inferior to AT&T in labor relations and balance-sheet strength. Avoid. Pfizer Inc. (PFE, $208 billion) is a stock I own for my more conservative clients, but I am getting nervous as the price has climbed to 30 times earnings. Neutral. Chevron Corp. (CVX, $187 billion) should gradually strengthen with the energy industry, like its big brother Exxon Mobil. I believe it is doing a better job in exploration than most. Buy. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B, $186 billion) looks like a bargain to me at 14 times earnings. It's run by investment genius Warren Buffett. No one can replace him, but he's clearly been working hard on succession planning.Buy. Coca-Cola Co. (KO, $184 billion) continues to show high profitability but little growth. People are starting to cut back on soda, and profit margins aren't as high on most other beverages. Avoid. Intel Corp. (INTC, $176 billion), the largest player in semiconductor chips for personal computers, has suffered as people move to smartphones and away from PCs. I think the stock will be a buy sometime, but not yet. Avoid. Merck & Co., like Pfizer, is a stock I've often owned for clients. But at present, with the stock at 35 times earnings, my enthusiasm is weak. Neutral. Past Results This is the 13th column I've written rating the biggest stocks. Overall, results for the first 12 columns have been respectable. My Buys returned an average of 12 percent in 12 months, my Neutrals 11.3 percent and my Avoids 9.3 percent. Last year, however, I had enough egg on my face to make a king-sized omelet. Led by Amazon.com, the stocks I said to avoid scored a 24.7 percent return, while my Buy-rated stocks managed only 4.8 percent.

At grocers large and small throughout Ohio, it costs about $3.50 for the basic family staple. Included in that price is any number of costs, ranging from growing the corn to manufacturing the box to transporting the product to stores. As is more often becoming the case, however, those prices on everyday staples are reflecting the heavy cost of regulatory compliance. From food producers to retailers, the cost of complying with unnecessary, burdensome state and federal regulations is eating an increasingly large portion of the already razor-thin margins for which our members – from Kroger to your local corner market – operate. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, President Obama is set to leave office as one of the most prolific regulators in history, as the federal government has issued 600 major regulations since 2009, impacting family-run grocers to large-scale manufacturers. And it’s about to get even worse. Enter the U.S. Treasury Department and its proposed regulations targeting corporate inversions – the rare practice in which a U.S. company purchases a smaller, foreign-based company to lower its tax burden. If this regulation – commonly referred to as Section 385 – were drafted in a narrow manner to target the actual abuses they were meant to address, it wouldn’t be a concern to Ohio’s grocers and the hard-working families we serve. But Treasury came up with a regulatory scheme that’s so broad it will alter day-to-day business operations and negatively impact every facet of our nation’s economy. Consider, for example, cash pooling – the basic process by which many businesses manage their day-to-day expenses. Just as a family pools together incomes and resources into a central account to pay for grocery bills or a mortgage, for example, companies with multiple locations and operations do the same, just on a larger scale. This broadly used tool, which has nothing to do with tax avoidance, enables companies to best allocate resources internally. Under Section 385, the government would decide how a business should best manage its internal operations as this basic cash management practice would essentially be banned, upending years of well-supported effective practice. But under Treasury’s new rule, this basic cash management practice – one that has nothing to do with taxes or inversions – would essentially be banned, upending years of well-supported, efficient practices. What’s more, implementing these regulations will result in unnecessary complexity and incredible cost for domestic businesses. In fact, Kroger chairman and CEO Rodney McMullen wrote in a July letter to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew that “The Kroger Co. may find itself in situation where we have to put in place burdensome documentation” – documentation that would be very costly for a company that operates on “very narrow margins.” With companies spending more on unnecessary regulatory compliance, that’s valuable capital that could’ve been invested in expanding a store or hiring more baggers at the check-out register, for example. McMullen isn’t alone as other Ohio leaders, including Procter & Gamble’s David Taylor, also wrote in a separate letter that the proposed Section 385 regulations would “disrupt ordinary business transactions” and “further reduce the competitive position of U.S. businesses.” Ultimately, the proposed Section 385 rules merely address the symptom rather than cure the disease that is America’s complex and uncompetitive tax code. Rather than bury job creators in more pages of regulations, the Obama administration should put the brakes on this dangerous proposal so Treasury can revise the regulation without placing heavy burdens on domestic job creators. 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2dAGclZ TOP VIDEOS Watch Google Home struggle to answer queries 1:34 Cole Swindell has ‘You Should be Here’ moment on CMA Awards red carpet 2:01 Cole Swindell talks about is favorite 30 seconds while on CMA Awards red carpet! 1:01 RaeLynn’s reaction to watching old clips from ‘The Voice’ is priceless! 0:50 What’s it like to be inducted into Country Music Hall of Fame?

(Mark Blinch For The Globe and Mail) Executive search specialist Tanya van Biesen has been named executive director of Catalyst Canada. (Mark Blinch For The Globe and Mail) Catalyst’s new executive director sees wealth of ‘untapped’ talent in Canada Add to ... Janet McFarland The Globe and Mail Published Tuesday, Sep. 27, 2016 12:06PM EDT Last updated Tuesday, Sep. 27, 2016 12:46PM EDT Comments Print / License AA The new head of women’s advocacy group Catalyst Canada says two decades of work searching for executives to fill senior roles in Canada has convinced her there is no shortage of talented women for top jobs, and has left her impatient with holdouts who continue to argue they can’t find qualified candidates. Executive search specialist Tanya van Biesen has been named executive director of Catalyst Canada, and said she knows plenty of talented women to fill senior roles without requiring companies to compromise quality. “I worked with clients every day on the difficulty of attracting talent, and I think there is such an untapped opportunity in this country and other countries around using the full weight of the work force,” Ms. van Biesen said in an interview. “If we as a society could just figure out how to better define the contributions people could make at the board level of the executive level, I think we could tap into such a large talent base.” Ms. van Biesen has worked at search firm Spencer Stuart since 2005, most recently co-leading the financial services practice at the firm, focusing on searches for directors, CEOs and general management-level executives. She also led the search firm’s Canadian diversity practice, helping companies hire chief diversity officers or find diverse slates of candidates for other roles. Ms. van Biesen will begin her new role at Catalyst next week, replacing former executive director Alex Johnston, who left in February to become vice-president of strategy and public affairs at the CBC. Catalyst advocates for women in senior roles, sponsors research and works directly with individual companies developing diversity strategies. Ms. van Biesen said she has been a strong supporter of new “comply or explain” rules in Canada, requiring companies to report annually on whether they have diversity policies or targets for women. But she said she has seen many companies use “easy outs” to explain why they have no policies while continuing to have no women in senior roles. “This is not a zero-sum game – this is not a woman gets a job so man doesn’t,” she said. “This is about building on the prosperity of this country… It’s about growing the pie, it’s not about me getting a piece and you not getting a piece. I’d be the wrong person for this job if I didn’t believe there is a pie to grow here.” She argues the discussion about advancing women has to shift from whether or why companies need more women in senior roles toward practical advice on how they can find and advance them. “I think the question is not so much ‘why’ any more but how – how do we break down the barriers and how do we access the talent pool?” she said. Catalyst CEO Deborah Gillis, who heads the New York-based organization, said Ms. van Biesen’s experience at the most senior levels of Corporate Canada means she “understands the competitive talent environment and the challenges facing women today.” “Her ability to work with others to inspire change will be a tremendous asset to the organization and our supporters as we continue to expand in Canada,” Ms. Gillis said in a statement. Ms. van Biesen began her career at Procter & Gamble, working in Toronto and Calgary in sales roles, and later worked at search firm TMP Worldwide Inc. and its predecessors in Canada before joining Spencer Stuart. She holds an MBA from the University of Toronto and a bachelor of commerce degree from Queen’s University. She is currently the Toronto chapter representative of the WomenCorporateDirectors Foundation, a global membership organization for female board directors.
