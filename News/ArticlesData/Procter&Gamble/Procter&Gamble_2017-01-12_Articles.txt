What Companies Have One? A razor-and-blade model can be lucrative. Here are some companies that employ this pricing strategy. Beth McKenna (TMFMcKenna) Jan 13, 2017 at 12:21PM Companies that have a razor-and-blade model use a pricing strategy that involves selling a durable product, or "razor," at a low profit margin (sometimes even giving it away) to help drive sales of the higher-margin proprietary consumable or disposable products, or "blades." The goal of companies that have this type of business model, which reportedly owes its name to Gillette's introduction of safety razors with disposable blades in the early 1900s, is to sell as many "razors" as possible in order to generate an increasing stream of recurring income from "blade" sales over the life of the "razor." Here are some diverse examples of companies that use a razor-and-blade strategy to varying degrees. Company Sector Market Cap The "Razors" The "Blades" Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG)  Consumer goods $221.7 billion Gillette razor handles Disposable razor blades Keurig Green Mountain Consumer goods N/A* Single-serve coffee brewers (and other beverage makers) K-cup coffee pods (and other pods and portion packs of other sizes) 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) Industrials** $1.6 billion 3D printers Print materials  Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) Industrials** $992.6 million 3D printers Print materials Amazon.com  Technology $379.7 billion Kindle e-readers e-books, music, and other offerings for Kindle   Data source: Yahoo! Finance for market caps. Data to Jan. 11. *No longer publicly traded. **Some financial sites classify 3D Systems and Stratasys in the technology sector. Let's examine the first four of the above companies. Procter & Gamble The razor-and-blade model owes its thanks to Gillette for its name. Image source: Getty Images. Global consumer products titan Procter & Gamble uses a razor-and-blade pricing strategy to sell its Gillette-brand razor handles and disposable blades. In 2015, the company had 18 brands that generated at least a billion dollars in sales each, with Gillette being just one of them. So the company is not a pure razor-and-blades play, or even close to one. Keurig Green Mountain  Image source: Keurig Green Mountain.  Keurig Green Mountain, which pioneered and popularized single-serve coffee brewers, adopted a razor-and-blade business model after the company -- then called Green Mountain Coffee Roasters -- acquired single-serve brewer maker Keurig in 2006. Keurig was bought out in early 2016 by an investor group led by privately held JAB Holdings, so its stock is no longer publicly traded.  Keurig's single-serve coffee brewers (and other brewers and beverage makers) are the "razors," and its K-cup coffee pods (and other pods and portion packs of different sizes) are the "blades." Keurig's original pricing policy involved selling its brewers and other beverage makers at only a small markup over its costs in order to entice as many consumers and businesses to buy them; we can assume its current general policy probably remains similar. The company makes most of its money on the recurring revenue stream of consumable pods and other portion packs, which are sold at a higher profit margin. Keurig provides a great example of both how razor-and-blade business models can be extremely lucrative and how they can eventually stumble. Soon after Green Mountain Coffee Roasters fully acquired Keurig in 2006, the company's business soared, along with its stock price. Consumers and businesses loved the convenience of Keurig machines and were locked into buying the company's proprietary K-cups. However, once certain key patents on Keurig's K-cups expired in 2012, competitors entered the market with less expensive coffee pods for the original Keurig brewers, and the company's fortunes ebbed and flowed after that time.  The market sent Keurig shares tumbling in 2011 and 2012 due to concerns about upcoming patent expirations and a couple other issues. Image source: Google Finance.  Keurig took steps to counter the challenges presented by the expiring patents. These included launching other brewers and beverage makers and equipping the Keurig 2.0 brewer with technology to lock out unauthorized coffee pods. These efforts were met with mixed success, however. 3D Systems and Stratasys 3D Systems and Stratasys both have razor-and-blade-like business models in their core products businesses, where the 3D printers that they sell are the "razors" and the print materials they sell are the "blades." These print materials are entirely polymers in Stratasys' case, and primarily polymers in 3D Systems' case. Both leading diversified 3D printing companies also have service businesses that do not use razor-and-blade strategies, so neither is a pure play. Moreover, some might not consider the business models they follow in their products businesses to be pure razor-and-blade models (which is why I used the term "razor-and-blade-like" above). A pure model of this type usually involves selling the "razor" at cost or just a little above cost, or even slightly below cost. 3D Systems and Stratasys price their 3D printers to make solid profits on them. However, they make considerably higher profit margins on the consumable print materials, which are proprietary. Plastic filaments -- the "blades" -- for Stratasys' MakerBot's 3D printers. Image source: Stratasys. The effectiveness of these business models is illustrated by the fact that, while the revenue 3D Systems generated from 3D printer sales declined 6% year over year in the third quarter, the revenue it took in from sales of print materials climbed 9%. In short  Razor-and-blade business models can be lucrative when they're working well, but they can stumble when competitors enter the market with a compelling "razor" that uses less-expensive "blades" -- or, as in Keurig's case, competitors launch "blades" that fit the company's "razor," as often occurs when patents expire.  Beth McKenna has no position in any stocks mentioned.

"The issue that I have is that the bank stocks, if you give them price-to-earnings multiple, they're the cheapest of any group in the stock market. I would sell Procter & Gamble and buy JPMorgan right now, " Cramer said on "Squawk on the Street." Cramer said, "JPMorgan is a totally defensible buy because it doesn't sell at a high multiple to earnings." Bank stocks have rallied in recent months on expectations that President-elect Donald Trump will eliminate regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. On Friday, JPMorgan's quarterly earnings pushed well past analysts' expectations, helped by double-digit growth in deposits and record credit card sales. Its stock price was up 1.4 percent in early trading Friday. Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said in a earnings release there is an opportunity this year for "good, rational and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented."

He added it will be difficult for China's foreign trade to improve in 2017 due to rising costs and other factors. China is the world's largest trading nation.

Nearly one-fifth of the index has been downgraded since Jan 3., including Coca-Cola (KO), Procter & Gamble (PG), Goldman Sachs (GS), Exxon Mobil (XOM), McDonald's (MCD) and Disney (DIS). Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs downgraded staples brands Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble from neutral to sell ratings in two reports, citing a stronger U.S. dollar for one and the price-earnings ratio for the other. Shares of both fell about 1 percent on the day the report came out. Exxon was downgraded to market perform from outperform at Wells Fargo, citing a closed window for an acquisition. McDonald's was downgraded on slowing sales, while Disney was lowered by Pivotal from hold to sell to account for changes in earnings expectations and changing political risks. And Citi downgraded Goldman to sell from neutral in a valuation call after the recent runup for the financials group. Despite the downgrades this month, the Dow has come within a third of a point of hitting the psychological mark of 20,000. Thursday the index closed down 63 points at 19,891, with Goldman contributing the most losses. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Currently 56% of its global production sites qualify as zero manufacturing waste to landfill. Plans are now in place to complete the remaining facilities over the next four years. This means eliminating or beneficially re-using about 650,000 metric tons of waste, equivalent to the weight of nearly 350,000 mid-sized cars that would typically go to landfills. “We are accelerating progress toward our long term vision and pushing ourselves to do more – with less waste,” said Shailesh Jejurikar, executive sponsor for sustainability and President of Global Fabric Care. “Since 2010, we’ve been working toward a vision of sending zero manufacturing and consumer waste to landfills. This announcement marks another step on that journey.” P&G will achieve its zero waste goals by ensuring all incoming materials are either: - converted into finished product, - recycled internally or externally or - re-used in alternative ways through partnerships. The company has been focusing on finding unique alternatives for its waste including the following: In Lima, Ohio, liquid waste from products like Tide and Gain are being converted to and other alternative fuels sources to power vehicles. In India non-recyclable plastic laminate materials from plants in Mandideep and Baddi, India are shredded and pressed into low-cost building panels. In China production waste from one facility is composted as "nutritional soil" for local parks; waste from another facility is being used as a raw material to make bricks. P&G said it is not only reusing and recycling for its own needs, but it is investing in local communities by helping convert its waste into raw materials and feedstock for other companies. Currently, more than half of P&G’s production sites have achieved zero manufacturing waste to landfill status, including a broad range of product families and geographic regions. In 19 countries (Germany, UK, Poland, Japan, Mexico, Spain, Egypt, Belgium, Ireland, Vietnam, Hungary, Indonesia, Czech, Romania, Singapore, Korea, Thailand, Turkey and Pakistan) all manufacturing facilities have met the zero waste qualification, and the company is approaching 100% of sites in other countries including China and India.

Business Secrets of my success: Bayer's Najoh Tita-Reid Najoh Tita-Reid Thursday 12 January 2017 12:20 BST Click to follow The Evening Standard Tita-Reid said her biggest break was avoiding being married off at a young age What do you do? I’m the general manager for Bayer consumer healthcare in the UK and Ireland. My division includes brands ranging from Berocca and Rennie to the women’s intimate health range Canesten. Positives? I like that our products are genuinely helping people feel better, faster. We’re also helping save the NHS millions by providing products, advice and self-diagnosis tools for people that allow them to care for themselves and save them from visiting a GP until they need their expertise. I like that my job allows me to build brands and customer relationships, be that through retailers, pharmacists, GPs, nurses or specialists.  Negatives? As a leader, you’re always outnumbered. The calls on your time from internal demands like email can take over your life if you don’t manage it properly. Biggest break? My biggest break was that, when I was 11, my grandmother tried to marry me off in our village in Cameroon to a very respectable family. I explained that I did not want to get married at 11 because I wanted to graduate from university and run a company one day. She looked at me in the middle of the bush and stared intensely after working hard to arrange such a marriage, and simply said: “Then surround yourself with the best, learn from the best, strive to be the best, and lift as you climb.”  I knew as we walked back to our village that evening, looking at other young women with families, that I had my first big break in life.   Wow! And professionally? It was in my final year at secondary school in America. I knew I wanted to be a general manager of a business and asked one of the professors how to do it. He said I needed an internship at Procter & Gamble because they’d trained more CEOs than any other company. I said: “how do I get one of those?” and he said I wouldn’t: I was only 16 and they only hire MBAs.  Nothing spurs me more than being told I can’t do something, so I asked every adult I met for a year if they could help, and eventually one said P&G were opening up their intern programme to a few non-MBA students. I applied and got a P&G internship at 17 and had exceptional mentors. I worked hard to get an invitation back every summer through college, and the experience was so positive I stayed for 18 years. I took my African grandmother’s advice and learned from the best. Biggest setback, and what did it teach you? I got a job as Merck’s general manager for Western Europe consumer care and moved my husband and two young kids over here. But just a few months later the business was sold to Bayer. It felt like being the child of a single parent who suddenly tells you they’re getting married and the wedding’s tomorrow. It was, like: “Who is he? Do I still get to live in the house? Do I get to keep my bedroom?” Eventually, after being interviewed many, many times, I secured my dream job, which I have now. After sleepless nights of the unknown for myself and my family, it turned out great. I tell young people all the time: get experience because one day when things get shaken up, and they will, your experience is all you can rely on. How is your work-life balance? You have got to accept that there is no balance. I am a mother, a wife, a daughter, a sister, and I work eight to 12 hours a day. I only have a few hours to be with my family and perform all those other roles too. So I found that striving for harmony, not balance, helped me stop feeling guilty. I focus on trying to make sure everything is working well, and if not, I pause and work it out. We have childcare and I have taken the lessons from my upbringing and created a supportive “village” around us of fellow parents and friends to help out with things. It really does take a village to raise a family. What’s helped you most in your career? So many things! I was born and raised in the US but my dad is African, and every summer when I was growing up, we’d go to my family’s village. It has its own king and a tribe. You had to walk to get water and carry it back on your head. You’d bathe out of a bucket, make your own toys. Growing up with that, you will rarely hear me complain or think something is impossible: there is always someone who has it worse and I believe anything is possible!

L’obiettivo è quello di arrivare al 100% dei siti in tutti i Paesi dove P&G è presente, inclusa l’impianto italiano di Gattatico (RE), dove si stanno facendo enormi progressi in tal senso. Il raggiungimento di questo risultato significherebbe riciclare o riutilizzare oltre 650.000 tonnellate di rifiuti, equivalenti al peso di 350.000 auto di medie dimensioni, che altrimenti andrebbero in discarica.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Jan 13, 2017 at 12:35PM As a new year starts, investors have likely had time to reflect on their stock market triumphs and failures in 2016. In 2017, many of the old challenges will persist as new ones emerge. Let's take a closer look at five things investors should do this year to stay ahead of the market. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Keep an eye on interest rates U.S. interest rates are widely expected to rise next year, which could impact your portfolio in three big ways. First, dividend stocks could become less attractive than bonds as yields rise -- meaning that income stocks with historically high multiples could tumble. One vulnerable stock is tobacco giant Altria (NYSE:MO), which currently pays a forward yield of 3.6% but trades at 26 times trailing earnings -- which is much higher than its industry average of 21. Second, higher interest rates make it harder for companies to boost their earnings with debt-fueled buybacks. Companies like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) might suffer because they fund their buybacks with debt, but companies like Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) -- which fully funds its buybacks with its free cash flow -- won't be affected. Higher interest rates could also reduce M&A activity due to higher borrowing costs. Lastly, higher interest rates will boost the profitability of banks, because they make savings accounts more attractive while boosting the interest collected on outstanding loans. 2. Mind the U.S. dollar The strong U.S. dollar, which could rise further with higher interest rates, could hurt multinational companies that generate a large percentage of their revenue overseas. This means that many blue chip stocks, like Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, and IBM, could report widening disparities between their constant currency and "as reported" growth. However, a strong U.S. dollar might make "All American" stocks which generate most of their revenue domestically more attractive than their multinational counterparts -- provided that their growth remains steady and valuations stay reasonable. 3. Understand the regulatory pressures In addition to a strong dollar, regulatory pressures both at home and abroad could punish multinational companies. Back at home, President-elect Donald Trump has called out companies like Apple and General Motors (NYSE:GM) for relying too heavily on overseas labor. If these companies are forced to relocate their manufacturing facilities back to the U.S., their operating expenses could surge and hurt their bottom line growth. U.S. companies could also keep struggling in China, where protectionist regulators have slapped American companies like Qualcomm, Microsoft, and General Motors with probes and fines over allegedly anti-competitive practices. Investors should keep a close eye on these moves, but they shouldn't panic and dump these stocks on just a few negative headlines. 4. Don't chase stocks you don't understand These issues and other factors are causing big investors to rotate out of certain sectors and into others. For example, many institutional investors are buying energy stocks due to higher oil prices, and financial stocks in expectation of rising interest rates. They've also been selling some big tech stocks like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet. That herd-like mentality boosted many major energy and financial stocks over the past few months, but investors shouldn't follow that lead if they don't understand those stocks or sectors. 5. Simply do nothing Buying and holding stocks isn't the same as buying and forgetting. Responsible investors should keep up with the latest news about interest rates, the dollar, and regulatory challenges, but they shouldn't sell their stocks based on headlines alone. Instead, the best move you can make in 2017 might be to simply sit still and stop trading your stocks. After all, Peter Lynch famously told investors that a "watched stock never boils." Unless something drastic happens, like the Trump Administration slapping companies with a 45% tax on goods manufactured in China, you may be better off simply holding your existing stocks -- provided that you did your due diligence before buying them.

What Companies Have One? A razor-and-blade model can be lucrative. Here are some companies that employ this pricing strategy. Beth McKenna (TMFMcKenna) Jan 13, 2017 at 12:21PM Companies that have a razor-and-blade model use a pricing strategy that involves selling a durable product, or "razor," at a low profit margin (sometimes even giving it away) to help drive sales of the higher-margin proprietary consumable or disposable products, or "blades." The goal of companies that have this type of business model, which reportedly owes its name to Gillette's introduction of safety razors with disposable blades in the early 1900s, is to sell as many "razors" as possible in order to generate an increasing stream of recurring income from "blade" sales over the life of the "razor." Here are some diverse examples of companies that use a razor-and-blade strategy to varying degrees. Company Sector Market Cap The "Razors" The "Blades" Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG)  Consumer goods $221.7 billion Gillette razor handles Disposable razor blades Keurig Green Mountain Consumer goods N/A* Single-serve coffee brewers (and other beverage makers) K-cup coffee pods (and other pods and portion packs of other sizes) 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) Industrials** $1.6 billion 3D printers Print materials  Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) Industrials** $992.6 million 3D printers Print materials Amazon.com  Technology $379.7 billion Kindle e-readers e-books, music, and other offerings for Kindle   Data source: Yahoo! Finance for market caps. Data to Jan. 11. *No longer publicly traded. **Some financial sites classify 3D Systems and Stratasys in the technology sector. Let's examine the first four of the above companies. Procter & Gamble The razor-and-blade model owes its thanks to Gillette for its name. Image source: Getty Images. Global consumer products titan Procter & Gamble uses a razor-and-blade pricing strategy to sell its Gillette-brand razor handles and disposable blades. In 2015, the company had 18 brands that generated at least a billion dollars in sales each, with Gillette being just one of them. So the company is not a pure razor-and-blades play, or even close to one. Keurig Green Mountain  Image source: Keurig Green Mountain.  Keurig Green Mountain, which pioneered and popularized single-serve coffee brewers, adopted a razor-and-blade business model after the company -- then called Green Mountain Coffee Roasters -- acquired single-serve brewer maker Keurig in 2006. Keurig was bought out in early 2016 by an investor group led by privately held JAB Holdings, so its stock is no longer publicly traded.  Keurig's single-serve coffee brewers (and other brewers and beverage makers) are the "razors," and its K-cup coffee pods (and other pods and portion packs of different sizes) are the "blades." Keurig's original pricing policy involved selling its brewers and other beverage makers at only a small markup over its costs in order to entice as many consumers and businesses to buy them; we can assume its current general policy probably remains similar. The company makes most of its money on the recurring revenue stream of consumable pods and other portion packs, which are sold at a higher profit margin. Keurig provides a great example of both how razor-and-blade business models can be extremely lucrative and how they can eventually stumble. Soon after Green Mountain Coffee Roasters fully acquired Keurig in 2006, the company's business soared, along with its stock price. Consumers and businesses loved the convenience of Keurig machines and were locked into buying the company's proprietary K-cups. However, once certain key patents on Keurig's K-cups expired in 2012, competitors entered the market with less expensive coffee pods for the original Keurig brewers, and the company's fortunes ebbed and flowed after that time.  The market sent Keurig shares tumbling in 2011 and 2012 due to concerns about upcoming patent expirations and a couple other issues. Image source: Google Finance.  Keurig took steps to counter the challenges presented by the expiring patents. These included launching other brewers and beverage makers and equipping the Keurig 2.0 brewer with technology to lock out unauthorized coffee pods. These efforts were met with mixed success, however. 3D Systems and Stratasys 3D Systems and Stratasys both have razor-and-blade-like business models in their core products businesses, where the 3D printers that they sell are the "razors" and the print materials they sell are the "blades." These print materials are entirely polymers in Stratasys' case, and primarily polymers in 3D Systems' case. Both leading diversified 3D printing companies also have service businesses that do not use razor-and-blade strategies, so neither is a pure play. Moreover, some might not consider the business models they follow in their products businesses to be pure razor-and-blade models (which is why I used the term "razor-and-blade-like" above). A pure model of this type usually involves selling the "razor" at cost or just a little above cost, or even slightly below cost. 3D Systems and Stratasys price their 3D printers to make solid profits on them. However, they make considerably higher profit margins on the consumable print materials, which are proprietary. Plastic filaments -- the "blades" -- for Stratasys' MakerBot's 3D printers. Image source: Stratasys. The effectiveness of these business models is illustrated by the fact that, while the revenue 3D Systems generated from 3D printer sales declined 6% year over year in the third quarter, the revenue it took in from sales of print materials climbed 9%. In short  Razor-and-blade business models can be lucrative when they're working well, but they can stumble when competitors enter the market with a compelling "razor" that uses less-expensive "blades" -- or, as in Keurig's case, competitors launch "blades" that fit the company's "razor," as often occurs when patents expire.  Beth McKenna has no position in any stocks mentioned.

(Photo by Theo Wargo/Getty Images for Honest.com) (2012 Getty Images) Hollywood actress Jessica Alba’s Honest Company seemed to be well on its way to becoming a consumer goods empire. Continue Reading Below In 2015, the starlet made the cover of Forbes for creating a billion-dollar company – which today is valued at $1.7 billion – that focuses on non-toxic, organic products. And she did it in just six years, which is something that attracted the attention of big corporations like Unilever and Proctor & Gamble. The two corporate giants were reportedly in talks to acquire Honest last year.  But along with the fast growth came growing pains –and they keep coming. After facing lawsuits over some of the ingredients used in its products, this week Honest Company announced a recall of its organic baby powder due to concerns it may cause skin irritation. One brand expert said even if the company is out in front of the complaint this time, it’s not good for business. “From falsely labeled as organic to a full-blown product recall, consumers have complained on social media widely about issues with the Honest companies products,” Kris Ruby, a brand expert and founder of Ruby Media Group, told FOXBusiness.com. “When customers sense the disconnect of what they were led to believe vs. the amount of product lawsuits they are now seeing, that absolutely tarnishes the long term-brand equity in Alba’s brand.” Related Stories Jessica Alba's Honest Co recalls organic baby powder in US First Sunscreen, Now Baby Food—Jessica Alba's Honest Co. Under Fire Jessica Alba's Honest Co. May Not Be So Honest An Honest Company spokeswoman said it recalled its baby powder out of an “abundance of caution,” but did not immediately comment on the prior product snafus.   “The Honest Company’s products are regularly tested to ensure their safety and quality,” the company said in a statement. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT In 2015, three years after the company began selling products, it was hit with its first class-action lawsuit seeking $5 million in damages for false advertising and causing physical harm to customers, who claimed their Honest Sunscreen SPF 30 made them suffer from severe burns and was ineffective. At the time, Honest released a statement saying its sunscreen was tested by an independent third party and it planned to “make things right.” The suit is still ongoing. Last year, the company was hit with three more lawsuits. One suit, involving laundry detergent, was filed after a Wall Street Journal investigation found sodium laurel sulfate (SLS), an ingredient that claims to “cause health problems for some,” in the company’s “honestly free” laundry detergent. The lawsuit claims the company falsely advertises its products. Honest later released a statement saying that the WSJ report was false, and that they use Sodium Coco Sulfate (SCS), not SLS like the report claimed. A month later, the company’s conditioning detangler and shampoo & body wash ended up in another lawsuit that alleged the products actually contained synthetic and toxic ingredients – even though its advertising claimed “no harsh chemicals.” And last spring, the Organic Consumers Association filed a suit alleging that Honest’s Organic Infant Formula is “in fact is not organic.” The suit alleges that 11 ingredients found in the formula violated the California Organic Products Act of 2003. The case was later dismissed but the Organic Consumers Association told FOXBusiness.com that it was appealing that decision. “We believe that on appeal, we will show that products in question do in fact violate USDA organic standards, and therefore the company's use of the ‘organic’ label is deceptive. Consumers expect all products labeled ‘USDA Organic’ to adhere to organic standards,” the organization said. “The Honest Co.'s infant formula, as the lawsuit clearly states, contains substances that are prohibited under those standards.” Earlier this week, the company issued a voluntary recall for all bottles of its organic baby power that has been sold in the United States following concerns it caused eye and skin infections. The company said the decision was reached after recent tests detected possible contaminations from microorganisms that could cause infections. Karen Post, author of the book “Brand Turnaround,” said the voluntary recall is actually a good sign for Alba’s company. “As long as she and her company leaders demonstrate they are responding responsibly to a product recall, she and they can manage through this,” Post told FOXBusiness.com. “Today, the public is very used to good companies getting hit with bad events that are often out of their direct control.” Branding expert Kait LeDonne agrees. She said Alba created the company because she genuinely wanted to see “a world that was safer for children and free of harsh ingredients.” “Sure, they have experienced a few issues, and they will weather them like any company presented with setbacks,” LeDonne said. “Had her purpose in starting the Honest Company been just another way to increase her brand equity, these issues may be detrimental to her brand. However, since I don't believe her own brand equity was the driving force behind starting Honest, I think her brand will come out stronger and ultimately be just fine.” Fox Business Markets Politics Features FBN TV About Fox Business Channel Finder Advertise With Us Jobs Internships New Terms of Use (What's new) New Privacy Policy FAQ Media Relations Closed Captioning Policy Accessibility Statement Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

Markets are weak Thursday going into earnings season for very good reasons. Until this week, stocks, the dollar, and 10-year yields have mostly moved sideways since mid-December. But this week the 10-year yield has slid to the lowest level since the end of November, and the dollar has slid back to its early December levels. I have called the market a "coiled spring" several times in the past week because markets are priced for perfection: stocks are at highs, investor sentiment is at highs, and consumer sentiment is at highs. On top of that, there are high — VERY high — expectations that earnings will expand in 2017. Some are anticipating the S&P 500 could put up a 20 percent increase in overall earnings. That is a LOT to ask. Throw in the now well-known "Trump tweet risk" and the difficulty of knowing the final impact of the Trump campaign promises of lower taxes/less/regulation/fiscal stimulus, and you've got plenty of reason for the markets to take a pause. Not surprisingly, some big names have seen downgrades this week, including Disney and Boeing today, joining Coca-Cola, Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble. It's worth noting expectations for bank earnings, since JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and PNC report tomorrow. While most industries are not seeing any increase in earnings expectations for 2017 since the election, earnings for big banks have seen modest increases. JPMorgan, for example, has seen 2017 earnings estimates go from $6.25 prior to the election to $6.50 today, according to Factset. That's a rise of about 4 percent. Other banks have also seen a rise in 2017 estimates since the election: Banks: 2017 earnings revisions (since Nov. 1) JPMorgan: up 4% Bank of America: up 7.6% PNCBank: up 3.1% WellsFargo: up 2.2% Source: Factset This is good news, but the problem is prices have run up big. The Bank ETF (KBE) is about 20 percent since the elections. Here's an additional problem: it's highly unlikely we are going to get 2017 earnings guidance from JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo or PNC. None of them gave 2016 guidance at this time last year. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon will certainly comment on the economy (I expect him to be upbeat) but he is notoriously dismissive of guidance. In a 2015 Bloomberg interview, Dimon took a dim view of predicting the future: "Don't make earnings forecasts. You don't know what's going to happen every quarter. I don't even care about quarterly earnings." Finally, I've been asked repeatedly how to play the bank earnings season. Unfortunately, precedent is not a lot of help. Our partners at Kensho note that JPMorgan has beaten estimates 22 times since 2010—that's about 75 percent of the time. On week later, JPMorgan is down an average of 0.3 percent, while the KBE is down an average of 0.2 percent. In other words, banks typically do not rally after earnings season. Where's all this going? I am bullish on earnings for the year, I believe they will see a nice boost. I'm not sure about 20 percent, but 10 percent is certainly doable. But the period we are going into now will be characterized by a dearth of clear information, and the markets need to take a breath and believe the data will be forthcoming. If it's tax cuts you are looking for, there are some positive signs already: the efforts to remove the Obamacare tax — already underway — will take capital gains taxes from 23.8 percent to 20 percent. That can happen very quickly!

Here's why markets are fading going into earnings season Bank earnings could push stocks past the tipping point.

Box 964, Chiloquin, OR 97624 ← ‘Doesn’t seem right’: Funeral home charges grieving families cremation ‘carbon tax’ McCain Says He Gave Trump Dossier to FBI → VA Whistleblower Received Death Threats for Supporting Troop Who Died Awaiting Care Posted on January 12, 2017 by Andrew Midkiff Free Thought Project – by Jack Burns Kuauhtemoc Rodriguez isn’t just a whistleblower in the Veterans Affairs Administration. He happens to be the Chief of Specialty Care Clinics at the Phoenix VA Health Care System, the same system of VA hospitals which were at the center of the firestorm of the scandalous controversy of 2014. Freethinkers may recall the Phoenix VA hospital was ground zero for a scheduling scandal where some 40 veterans passed away while waiting to see a doctor at the VA.   The scandal led to the firing of several senior-level hospital administrators, criminal investigations by the FBI, several bills in Congress passed to protect veteran’s healthcare needs, and eventually led to the replacement of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. President Obama replaced VA Sec. Eric Shinseki with former Proctor & Gamble CEO Robert A. McDonald. But Phoenix, AZ’s Rodriguez says more work still needs to be done, and he blew the whistle again in March 2016, on the VA’s handling of canceling appointments. Recall that the first scandal involved veterans not being able to get an appointment in time, leading to several deaths. Rodriguez noticed appointments made by veterans who had already passed away were being cancelled by those same dead veterans. Rodriguez took his case to the court of public opinion and, according to AZ Family, the Chief of Specialty Care Clinics showed reporters several screenshots which indicated the deceased veterans had actually cancelled their own appointments. AZ Family reported in March, “hundreds of appointments that were more than 120 days past due to be scheduled were deleted from the system. That means many are still waiting to be seen and might not even realize they’re no longer in the system. ‘Obviously, if you’re deceased you’re not going to call the clinic and cancel your own appointment,’ said Kuauhtemoc Rodriguez, Chief of Specialty Care Clinics at the Phoenix VA.” Months later, in May of 2016, Rodriguez, an Army veteran, felt the need to use the federal whistleblower system to report alleged retaliation against him, which he claimed also included death threats. According to the whistleblower form obtained by The Free Thought Project, Rodriguez alleged, “The Medical Center Deputy Director and the Medical Center Director have engaged in retaliation by notifying me that I was going to be removed from my position as Chief of Specialty Care Clinics at the Phoenix VA. The intent of these acts is merely to retaliate against me for exposing wrong doing, patient deaths due to delay of care, and mismanagement of Veterans programs by executive leadership and mid level managers. In addition I have exposed continued mismanagement at the Health System Specialist Level, Supervisory Level and Human Resources which has created a hostile working environment for me.” The VA executive, after making the case that the retaliation against him was because he blew the whistle, then detailed the type of harassment he’s received since coming forward with such damning accusations. “I’m continually harassed by management at the highest levels, kept from meetings, have had my duties removed, and have been threatened with removal. In addition data shows that my leadership has enabled the facility to reduce patient backlog in consults, appointments for the last year and I have been still rated as fully successful in order to deny me advancement. In addition I have been denied advancement in positions I have applied for and have been recommended for hiring, again due to my whistleblower status.” Whistleblowers are supposed to be protected under the federal Whistleblower Protection Act, from harassment for speaking out, but Rodriguez says he feels anything but protected. “Also the facility has failed to create a safe environment for me and has allowed various employees to threaten me physically, and one employee who threatened my life are still allowed to operate with impunity,” he writes. He also notes that his complaints to administration have fallen on deaf ears. “In addition I have and continue to be slandered by other managers at the phoenix VA with executive leadership knowing about it, and covering it up. The executive leadership of the facility seems to encourage personal attacks upon me professionally by allowing these attacks to happen. I have been subjected to this abuse for over a year now and they are still occurring,” he writes. Now, Rodriguez is being called to answer for his actions. Instead of the VA answering for theirs, according to The Free Beacon, Rodriguez is, “now being forced to testify before an Administrative Investigation Board (AIB) regarding allegations that his department leadership created a hostile work environment and engaged in discriminatory practices. In conversations with the Washington Free Beacon, Rodriguez described the administrative investigation as the latest attempt by hospital leaders to ‘deflect from their malfeasance,’ claiming that hospital staffers have been retaliating against him for months after he blew the whistle on management failings at the facility.” By all appearances, it seems that Rodriguez’ fate has already been decided, whether he knows it or not. As The Free Thought Project has faithfully reported, when whistleblowers do come forward, they’re often harassed, censored, fired, or worse, and yet, in the end, many of the whistleblowers end up suing their employers, often winning millions of dollars in restitution. But for now, Rodriguez can only hope, wait, and endure whatever comes his way. According to the Free Beacon’s report, the problem at the VA, under the Obama administration, has not gotten better. Instead, it has gotten much worse. The latest report by the Office of the Inspector General found that 200 veterans had died waiting for appointments, up from the 40 deaths from the scandal of 2014. Now, the one person who blew the whistle is apparently being brought up on charges. “Rodriguez was informed on Dec. 9 that he was being summoned to provide testimony for the administrative investigation into allegations that leaders at the Health Administration Services (HAS), his department, ‘created a hostile work environment and engaged in discriminatory practices.’ The hearing, convened by RimaAnn Nelson, interim director of the Phoenix VA, was initially scheduled for Dec. 22 but has since been rescheduled for Jan. 12.” The Free Beacon also contacted another VA employee turned whistleblower. His name is Brandon Coleman, a Marine veteran who helped coordinate mental health care at the VA hospital in Phoenix. Coleman reportedly told the Free Beacon, “In my case, it was proven up to 17 suicidal vets had escaped from the hospital and for that disclosure I was sent home for 460 days of leave, had my successful program destroyed, and even had a gag order placed on me by the hospital director trying to take away my First Amendment rights by forbidding me from seeking health care as a disabled veteran at the Phoenix VA hospital,” Coleman said. “I am one of the lucky ones…I won my case with (sic) help of Congress and the media. But there are hundreds of nameless VA whistleblowers no one will ever know who were also brave enough to bring up wrong doing.” Coleman blames Obama and his administration for going after whistleblowers in some supposed attempt to avoid scandals. “If the next administration wants to protect whistleblowers then they first must acknowledge us. Under President Obama, VA leadership (both locally and nationally) was allowed to ‘hunt’ whistleblowers and many of us were sent running for our lives, forced to try and restart our careers at new locations, for doing nothing wrong other than telling the truth,” Coleman concluded. Ironically enough, Valerie Jarrett, Obama’s top advisor, proudly proclaimed last Sunday on CNN’s  Fareed Zakaria GPS, “The president prides himself on the fact that his administration hasn’t had a scandal and that he hasn’t done something to embarrass himself.” Arguably, an untold number of whistleblowers would likely disagree with Jarrett, having been silenced by the same type of intimidation Rodriguez reportedly has experienced, even to the point of death threats being leveled against them.

Rhonda Schaffler Jan 12, 2017 9:57 AM EST Clorox ( CLX)  was recently upgraded by Barclays at the same time Goldman Sachs downgraded two of its consumer products peers - P&G ( PG)  and Coca-Cola ( KO) .  But that doesn't mean Clorox is ready to take them on. Foreign currency challenges have clouded Clorox' earnings, and the company has missed earnings estimates. Meantime, its price to earnings ratio is expensive when compared to the likes of P&G and Kimberly-Clark ( KMB) . Also, price forecasts for Clorox indicate a limited upside from its current stock price.

Cloverleaf The next time you pick up a six-pack of Coca-Cola at your local grocery store, artificial intelligence may be analyzing your eye movements and facial expressions. Today, tech vendor Cloverleaf is launching artificial intelligence-powered digital signs that slide over retailers' shelves to give marketers insights about who is standing in front of their store displays. Procter & Gamble has tested the technology—dubbed shelfPoint—and Dell is currently using it in a Micro Center store in Houston, Texas. "We're able to gather insights about what shoppers are doing in front of the shelf itself, engage them and convert the sale to get them to throw one more item into the basket," explained Gordon Davidson, founder and CEO of Cloverleaf. Here's how it works: The gadget is a 4-foot by 2-inch digital screen that wraps around retailers' shelves and displays digital ads that can be swapped out on the fly. Built-in optical sensors then detect anonymous information about shoppers. The technology can examine someone's facial expressions and let retailers see traffic patterns and consumer demographics. The shelves notably do not collect personal information; instead it runs in the background and looks for bits of basic information—like age, gender and ethnicity. "There is no video or pictures captured," Davidson said. "Instead, it's using templates on a face that we match that then allows us to see if it's a female or male and the level of expression." Based on the demographics and sentiment that the sensors pick up, marketers can then test different campaigns and swap out creative on the fly. For example, Coca-Cola could run images of bubbles on end caps to initially grab consumers' attention and then run different creative next to the products on the shelf to distinguish Coca-Cola from Diet Coke. And later this year, Davidson said Cloverleaf will add technology that allows retailers to see if someone picked an item off a store shelf. "[There's] a lot of technology thrown at retailers and brands and consumers walking through the store," Davidson said. "As a brand, one of the hardest things you have to overcome is getting people to notice a new promotion or a new product."

Today, tech vendor Cloverleaf is launching artificial intelligence-powered digital signs that slide over retailers' shelves to give marketers insights about who is standing in front of their store displays. Procter & Gamble has tested the technology—dubbed shelfPoint—and Dell is currently using it in a Micro Center store in Houston, Texas. "We're able to gather insights about what shoppers are doing in front of the shelf itself, engage them and convert the sale to get them to throw one more item into the basket," explained Gordon Davidson, founder and CEO of Cloverleaf. Here's how it works: The gadget is a 4-foot by 2-inch digital screen that wraps around retailers' shelves and displays digital ads that can be swapped out on the fly. Built-in optical sensors then detect anonymous information about shoppers. The technology can examine someone's facial expressions and let retailers see traffic patterns and consumer demographics. The shelves notably do not collect personal information; instead it runs in the background and looks for bits of basic information—like age, gender and ethnicity. "There is no video or pictures captured," Davidson said. "Instead, it's using templates on a face that we match that then allows us to see if it's a female or male and the level of expression." Based on the demographics and sentiment that the sensors pick up, marketers can then test different campaigns and swap out creative on the fly. For example, Coca-Cola could run images of bubbles on end caps to initially grab consumers' attention and then run different creative next to the products on the shelf to distinguish Coca-Cola from Diet Coke. And later this year, Davidson said Cloverleaf will add technology that allows retailers to see if someone picked an item off a store shelf. "[There's] a lot of technology thrown at retailers and brands and consumers walking through the store," Davidson said. "As a brand, one of the hardest things you have to overcome is getting people to notice a new promotion or a new product."

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars Follow us on social: AI This device from Cloverleaf and Affectiva tracks your emotional reaction to products while shopping Khari Johnson@kharijohnson January 12, 2017 5:00 AM Tags: Affectiva, ai, artificial intelligence, Cloverleaf, Dell, emotional analytics, Emotional Intelligence Above: shelfPoint display and optical sensor reads a shopper's emotional reaction to a product on store shelves Image Credit: Cloverleaf That area on store shelves typically reserved for price tags and logos may soon be occupied by sensors with the ability to track people and their emotional response to products. Announced today by Cloverleaf, shelfPoint is an LCD display with eye-level sensors that recognize joy, sadness, happiness, or disgust in a shopper’s face. Dell and other early partners will begin to use shelfPoint by mid-2017, said CEO Gordon Davidson, and the device will be available to other retailers later this year. In addition to tracking emotional reactions, shelfPoint registers the age, gender, and ethnicity of shoppers and records the amount of time a person spends lingering in front of a display ad. And sensors don’t just record metrics. They also respond in real time. Ads can change if sensors detect that a shopper is displeased by what they see. Studies with Proctor & Gamble and other partners found that impulse buys and purchases were nearly 40 percent higher with shelfPoint than with the average store shelf or cardboard promotional material. The shelfPoint sensor is placed in high traffic areas to boost the sale of high-margin items or impulse purchases, Davidson told VentureBeat in a phone interview. “As people are walking by, we want to attract their attention, cause them to turn their head,” Davidson said. “Then what we do is we change the content and have more of a conversion story.” He said the focus is on “presenting the promotion and causing consumers to throw another item into the basket and drive impulse sales.” ShelfPoint made its debut today at the National Retail Federation conference taking place this week in New York. The tech that determines an emotional response comes from Affectiva. Starting with video and branching into virtual reality and other mediums, Affectiva has developed a way to track a person’s emotion in real time. Insights gathered from the anonymized aggregate data are used to serve up results and advice to store owners and brands. ShelfPoint also tracks in-store traffic and can be used for A:B testing of marketing or products. “Frankly, given the velocity you have in these high-traffic stores, you can get answers to these questions literally in a matter of a couple of days,” a Cloverleaf spokesperson told VentureBeat. The display also records facial characteristics to recognize if a person returns to the shelf within 24 hours. Despite this ability, Davidson said shelfPoint doesn’t use facial recognition. “Facial recognition would suggest that we know who is there, and we’re looking at them. What we do is face detection, and so we do not retain or capture any personally identifiable information,” he said. “We don’t record video or capture pictures. What we’re looking at is spots on the face, and then we translate that into metadata that says here’s the makeup of the individual that’s in front of it. We’d never be able to identify you.” ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Jeremy Pelzer, cleveland.com jpelzer@cleveland.com During his first post-election press conference, Donald Trump unveils his ethics plan and admits Russian involvement in hacking of Democratic emails. The Cleveland Clinic will work to help Trump improve veterans' healthcare. And after a divisive leadership election, the Ohio GOP's A-listers are coming together for a pre-inauguration bash. Today's Ohio Politics Roundup is brought to you by Jeremy Pelzer.  Trump talks ethics, Russia during long-awaited news conference: Donald Trump's first post-election news conference on Wednesday lived up to the anticipation, as the president-elect announced plans to step away from his business empire but not divest his ownership, admitted for the first time that Russia was behind last year's hacking of Democratic emails, and sparred with reporters over reports that he and his advisers were being squeezed by the Russians. Cleveland.com's Stephen Koff has the details. The doctor is in: Trump also announced that his pick for Veterans Affairs secretary is David Shulkin, a physician (but not a military veteran) who's currently undersecretary for health at the VA, Koff reports. Trump's nomination comes after Cleveland Clinic CEO Toby Cosgrove turned down the VA job. If confirmed, Shulkin would succeed current Veterans Affairs Secretary Bob McDonald, a former Procter & Gamble CEO who was recently a candidate to become president of the University of Cincinnati, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer's Anne Saker. Cleveland Clinic to help with vets' healthcare reforms: Trump said that Cosgrove will still play a key role in reforming the VA health-care system, according to cleveland.com's Sabrina Eaton. The president-elect said he'll rely on a task force of experts and institutions, including Cosgrove and the Cleveland Clinic, to come up with a plan for improving veterans' care. As Trump outlined his plans to give up management of his companies, U.S. Rep. Mary Kaptur, a Toledo Democrat, introduced legislation Wednesday to block Trump from accepting foreign gifts while he's president, Eaton reports. The bill, which has little chance of passing the GOP-controlled Congress, is intended to ensure that Trump complies with the U.S. Constitution's Emolument's Clause, which is meant to fight bribery. Trump said Wednesday he'll donate all his hotel profits from foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury. Good-government groups, though, say Trump's plan doesn't do enough to prevent conflicts of interest. The reaction to Trump's presser from Northeast Ohio? Mixed, as cleveland.com reporters Mary Kilpatrick and Andrew J. Tobias found. Trump supporters said they felt the president-elect held his own against the media, and they were glad to hear Trump reiterate campaign promises such as repealing and replacing Obamacare. Trump opponents, on the other hand, said they were turned off by Trump's combative tone and vague promises. Trumpisms were on full display: Trump's distinctive rhythm and word choice was in full effect during the news conference. Cleveland.com's Zachariah Durr takes us through the top "Trumpisms" on display during the presser. Putting the band back together: "A week after a tense family feud, the Ohio Republican Party's biggest stars finally are coming together in the name of Donald Trump," writes cleveland.com's Henry J. Gomez. At the Ohio GOP's pre-inauguration party in Washington on Jan. 19, scheduled attendees include Gov. John Kasich, new state party chair Jane Timken (who beat Kasich-backed incumbent party chair Matt Borges last week). Also on the list: U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, every statewide officeholder, the GOP leaders in the General Assembly, and the state's GOP congressional delegation. Needling Trump: Knitters in Ohio and elsewhere are making pink hats with cat-like ears to be worn during the Jan. 21 Women's March on Washington, Eaton writes. The "pussy hats" are meant to help marchers make a "unique collective visual statement which will help activists be better heard." Ohio, post-Obamacare: "A pair of reports released Wednesday show repealing the Affordable Care Act without a replacement program would jeopardize health coverage for nearly 1 million Ohioans, many who suffer from mental illness or substance abuse," reports cleveland.com's Jackie Borchardt. "An estimated 220,512 Ohioans suffering from mental illness or drug abuse would lose access to mental health services" if Obamacare is repealed, according to a new study from Harvard Medical School and New York University. A second study from Policy Matters Ohio found 964,000 Ohioans would lose coverage by 2019, while Ohio would lose $3.5 billion in federal Medicaid expansion money in 2019. Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, in a press call, said the Harvard/NYU report shows that "repealing the law would immediately interrupt treatment for hundreds of thousands of Ohioans who are struggling with addiction and fighting for their lives." Kasich, a Medicaid expansion proponent who plans to meet behind closed doors with Senate Republicans in Washington next week, said Wednesday he's open to changing federal health care policy. "But you have to tell me what you are going to do about it, because you just can't tell 700,000 people 'you can't get help,'" Kasich said. Rob Portman questions Tillerson: Portman, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, questioned secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson on Wednesday about fighting cyberattacks from foreign nations, preserving the U.S.' NATO obligations, and helping Ukraine against Russia. Portman questioned Tillerson about the use of propaganda and disinformation campaigns by Russia and other countries against the U.S. and other democratic nations. Tillerson said he didn't know the best way to combat such efforts, saying multi-agency assessment is needed. "To be honest, the bad actors have got the jump on us," Tillerson said. Answering Portman, Tillerson said he wouldn't threaten to break the U.S. commitment to help fellow NATO nations that come under attack. Tillerson also pledged that the U.S. wouldn't recognize Russia's sovereignty over Crimea unless the Ukrainian people agree to it and supports keeping U.S. sanctions in place against Russia over the issue. Abortion fight resumes in 2017: With a new year and a new legislative session comes a new battle over abortion in Ohio. As cleveland.com's Robert Higgs explains, the controversial "heartbeat bill" vetoed by Kasich last month could make a return, as could bills to block abortion after a Down Syndrome diagnosis or regulations for handling fetal remains. Meanwhile, courts are still deliberating lawsuits over steps the state has already taken, such as increased regulations for abortion clinics and defunding Planned Parenthood.

"Following" : "Follow"}} January 13, 2017 10:28am   Comments Share: Related JPM The Program For Trading Like A Hedge Fund Mid-Afternoon Market Update: Dow Turns Negative; Sanchez Energy Shares Spike Higher U.S. Banks Q4 Comps: Operating Leverage Looks Strong In Key Banks (Seeking Alpha) Financial stocks led the charge Friday after some of the largest banks posted encouraging Q4 earnings results. Jim Cramer weighed in on the earnings and suggested investors might be wrong in taking advantage of Friday's gains to take some profits off the table. He argued only traders would be looking to take profits on Friday as banks just posted an "unbelievable" quarter. Cramer said that when he looks at The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO) or Clorox Co (NYSE: CLX), he doesn't see the potential for these supposed-growth stocks to raise their dividends and demonstrate strong organic growth - but the same can't be said for bank stocks. Cramer singled out Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC) and suggested that a 100-basis point increase in the Federal Reserve interest rate will by itself result in an incremental $3 billion added to the company's financials. "Do you think Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG) can add on that kind of number?" he hypothetically asked. However, Cramer thinks JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) wasn't just a standout in the bank sector given its record annual profit of almost $25 billion for the year and an ROE of 11 percent. "This was the best quarter ever [for JPMorgan]," Cramer said. "And all I can say is that there is going to be very many better quarters ever."

In May, the European Food Standards Authority warned that the contaminants found in the oil's edible form are carcinogenic. It warned that even moderate consumption of the substances represented a risk to children and said that, due to a lack of definitive data, no level could be considered safe. Palm oil is found in hundreds of household name food brands including Cadbury's chocolate, Clover and even Ben & Jerry's, but Nutella has so far faced the brunt of a consumer backlash. Sales fell by three per cent as consumers boycotted the product, fearing it could be harmful. Coop, the country's biggest supermarket chain removed 200 products containing palm oil, though not Nutella, from its shelves in May as a precaution. In response, Ferrero has launched an advertising campaign in an attempt to reassure customers that its products are totally safe. Ferrero insists that the decision to keep palm oil in Nutella, despite safety fears, is about quality, not cost. The substance is used to give the spread its smooth texture which it says can't be achieved by using other oils. "Making Nutella without palm oil would produce an inferior substitute for the real product, it would be a step backward," Ferrero's purchasing manager Vincenzo Tapella told Reuters. Substitute oils, derived for example from sunflowers or rapeseed, could be used but would increase the cost of making the product by as much as $22m (£18m), a calculation by Reuters found. Ferrero has not confirmed the figures. The company was not immediately available for comment. The cancer fears centre on a compounds known as glycidyl fatty acid esters (GE), which are produced in palm oil when it is heated above 200 degrees celsius, as it is in the processing of for many foods. Dr Helle Knutsen, chair of Contam, the EFSA panel that investigated palm oil, said in May: "There is sufficient evidence that glycidol is genotoxic and carcinogenic, therefore the Contam panel did not set a safe level for GE." The contaminants can be found in some other vegetable oils, margarines and processed foods but the EFSA found that they are produced in higher, potentially dangerous, amounts in palm oil. The World Health Organisation and UN Food and Agriculture Organisation have also expressed concerns about GE but have stopped short of issuing warnings about its consumption. A spokesperson for Ferrero said: "The health and safety of consumers is an absolute and first priority for Ferrero. "The presence of contaminants in food products, analyzed by the EFSA, depends on the oils and fats used as well as the processes they are subjected to. "It is for this reason that for some time now Ferrero has been carefully selecting raw materials and industrial processes that limit their presence to minimum levels, fully in line with the parameters defined by the EFSA." Environmental concerns It is not the first time that palm oil has caused controversy. In November Amnesty International raised concerns that global firms including Colgate-Palmolive, Kellogg's, Nestlé, Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever have been using palm oil produced by children as young as eight, working in hazardous conditions on Indonesian plantations. Children were carrying sacks of palm fruit weighing up to 25kg, for Singapore-based company Wilmar, Amnesty found. Palm oil has long been linked to environmental degradation, including mass deforestation causing the loss of critical habitats for endangered species such as orangutans. Ferrero says all of the oil it uses comes from sustainable sources as certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, a body set up by major producers and purchasers to set standards and self-regulate the industry. The RSPO has been criticised by many non-governmental organisations who say that its standards are too low and enforcement too weak. Greenpeace said in its 2013 report "Certifying Destruction" that the RSPO's standards left it free to fell pristine forests to make way for plantations.  cancer Read More Login to follow editors picks Read More Login to follow food Read More Login to follow nutella Read More Login to follow Topics:  cancer editors picks food nutella 0 PRINT Just In OPINION: Tomizawa feeds the flames Help special athletes reach their goals SPER: Govt cracking down on Ipswich's $40M debt Search on after couple kidnapped, locked in container Suburban shooting may have been mistaken identity: Police 'Shattered': Single dad victim in morning hit and run Top Stories Help special athletes reach their goals Program for special need athletes in desperate need of coaches News 16th Jan 2017 1:00 PM Comment SPER: Govt cracking down on Ipswich's $40M debt Search on after couple kidnapped, locked in container Police call interpreter for probe into kidnapping claim Suburban shooting may have been mistaken identity: Police Police puzzled over motive for attack 'Shattered': Single dad victim in morning hit and run Ipswich man's parked car, house badly damaged Local Partners Community Your Story Local History More Community What's On Gatton family claims game show success A GATTON family walked away with more than $11,000 after an exciting three-night run on game show Family Feud.

In May, the European Food Standards Authority warned that the contaminants found in the oil’s edible form are carcinogenic. It warned that even moderate consumption of the substances represented a risk to children and said that, due to a lack of definitive data, no level could be considered safe. Palm oil is found in hundreds of household name food brands including Cadbury’s chocolate, Clover and even Ben & Jerry’s, but Nutella has so far faced the brunt of a consumer backlash. Several retailers in Italy, including the country’s biggest supermarket chain, Coop, have boycotted the spread as a precaution. In response, Ferrero has launched an advertising campaign in an attempt to reassure customers that its products are safe. Ferrero insists that the decision to keep palm oil in Nutella, despite safety fears, is about quality, not cost. The substance is used to give the spread its smooth texture which it says can’t be achieved by using other oils. “Making Nutella without palm oil would produce an inferior substitute for the real product, it would be a step backward,” Ferrero’s purchasing manager Vincenzo Tapella told Reuters. Substitute oils, derived for example from sunflowers or rapeseed, could be used but would increase the cost of making the product by as much as $22m (£18m), a calculation by Reuters found. Ferrero has not confirmed the figures. The company was not immediately available for comment. The cancer fears centre on a compounds known as glycidyl fatty acid esters (GE), which are produced in palm oil when it is heated above 200 degrees celsius, as it is in the processing of for many foods. It is not the first time that palm oil has caused controversy. In November Amnesty International raised concerns that global firms including Colgate-Palmolive, Kellogg’s, Nestlé, Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever have been using palm oil produced by children as young as eight, working in hazardous conditions on Indonesian plantations. Children were carrying sacks of palm fruit weighing up to 25kg, for Singapore-based company Wilmar, Amnesty found. Palm oil has long been linked to environmental degradation, including mass deforestation causing the loss of critical habitats for endangered species such as orangutans. Ferrero says all of the oil it uses comes from sustainable sources as certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, a body set up by major producers and purchasers to set standards and self-regulate the industry.

Apple , Google, Tesla , Microsoft , Amazon and Netflix took the top six spots in the annual poll of 50 companies conducted by Boston Consulting Group (BCG), which drew on responses from more than 1,500 C-suite leaders. Apple topped BCG's list for the 11th straight year, which isn't surprising given the massive amount it spends on research and development (R&D). The consumer electronics giant invested $10 million into R&D for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 24, 2016, its financial statement showed. Meanwhile, Google's problem solving tactics and its famous '20 percent rule,' which encourages employees to dedicate 20 percent of their time to passion projects, ensured the search giant stayed in second place for the third straight year. Two Asian firms managed to make it into the top ten rankings, with South Korea's Samsung Group at number seven, followed by Japan's Toyota Motor in eighth place. A total of six Asian players were on the list in total. Ten European companies were featured, including Bayer at number 11, BMW at number 14 and Daimler at number 16. Honda Motor, BT Group and Procter & Gamble rounded out the last three spots on BCG's report. "Given faster-changing markets-and the fact that even in more traditional sectors technology is becoming a key differentiator-a not-invented-here mindset can be fatal," said BCG partner Andrew Taylor. "Today's most successful innovators strike a strategic balance between internal and external innovation. They are smart and efficient at scanning for external ideas-and deft at bringing them inside." BCG's research found that the majority of strong innovators took an analytical approach to the pursuit of new ideas, with 65 percent discovering fresh perspectives from social networks and big data mining. Leading innovators also complement traditional vehicles such as joint ventures with newer approaches like corporate venture capital and incubators to foster a more outward-looking culture, BCG noted. For example, 62 percent of strong innovators used incubators, the report found. —Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

Flagging these misuses has become a veritable pastime, like trainspotting. The designer of the recent “Paul Ryan Speaker” logo was either blind to or ignorant of the logo’s similarity to the Grosse Deutschland symbol — the national emblem of the Third Reich – which itself derived from the imperial eagle and was worn by all members of the military and by the SS and the Nazi party. And both of those possibilities are worrying. For among the prize spots for the design watchers are those that inadvertently resemble Nazi signs. The blame for these types of faux pas usually falls on the designers themselves, who, aesthetically seduced by what is generally acknowledged as the most effective political branding system in history, copy from the original indiscriminately. In this instance, though, given his national political position, Ryan must take some of the responsibility. It is odd for the speaker of the United States House of Representatives to have a personal brand mark. The office of official heraldry is set up to serve government agencies, but not government officers, with a range of traditional symbols. So, it seems especially impolitic for Ryan to have his own, especially one that is so potentially offensive. Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email Paul Ryan Slams Donald Trump for Star of David Debacle July 5, 2016 Whether or not the mark reveals the speaker’s hubris, the eagle is an ancient heraldic symbol representing empires, kingdoms, dictatorships and democratic nations, including — of course — our own. Rep. Ryan’s choice, therefore, is consistent with acceptable American iconography. As our national symbol, deeply rooted in an historical heritage, the American bald eagle dates back to 1782, when the great seal of the United States was adopted. Still, even the best-known symbols are subject to misinterpretation based on subjective perception. Logos are only as good as the institutions they represent. Experienced logo designers are trained to manipulate signs and symbols so that they are meaningful, memorable and, most of all, positive. Mistakes happen, including unintentional sexual or phallic innuendos or unfortunate double entendres. In 1991, a brouhaha erupted when Procter & Gamble’s vintage trademark of the Man in the Moon was called “satanic.” It was a costly hoax that plagued the brand for years. Ryan’s logo has not suffered the same public relations fate as yet. But there are rumbles in some logo circles that this will be a costly error on Ryan’s part, especially given the rise of the “alt-right.” But let’s take a close look. For design purposes, the name “Paul Ryan” is typographically balanced, so the visual mark is nicely positioned between the four letters of his first and last names. Although the eagle is modeled to suggest the top of an American flagpole, its expanded wings, left-sideways facing head and talons clutching a globe are perilously close to the foul German iteration. Nazi markings are not commonly misappropriated. Although the Nazis used a number of eagles, the fashion company Boy London continues to use one of them with its talons clutching the O in “boy.” In the early 1990s the D.C. United soccer team emblem showed an imperial-looking eagle, with talons, holding a soccer ball, in a logo that has since been revised. Olympic Logo Rorschach Test Gabriel SandersJune 7, 2007 For similar reasons, in 2007 the fashion retailer Zara was forced to withdraw a handbag from the market when it was felt that the swastika on it was too negatively charged by the Nazi use of the symbol. I doubt Ryan’s logo is meant to be a deliberate reference to the Third Reich. But there is a lesson to be learned about how powerful Nazi symbols remain in the minds of many of us. But in the minds of younger generations, while the swastika and SS runes still have symbolic power, other Nazi symbols carry only a vague sense of oppression. So, while there are movements devoted to returning the swastika to its earlier benign state as an ancient symbol of good fortune, and while there are many non-malevolent instances of majestic eagle symbolism, these designs still represent, in living memory, the most evil regime that has ever run a modern Western state. Designers who serve companies, organizations and especially governments that use symbols need to understand the impact of visual icons and to avoid those that, by aligning you visually with untenable allies, can be sharp, double-edged swords.

Lifestyle Nutella has now been linked to cancer, according to report Nutella contains palm oil, which is more carcinogenic than any other oil Natalie Gil, Refinery29 Thursday 12 January 2017 15:20 BST Click to follow ES Lifestyle As if January wasn't bleak enough already. Now, we may not even be able to eat one of our favourite comfort foods anymore without knowingly risking our health. Foods that contain palm oil could pose a cancer risk, according to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and Nutella has so far faced the brunt of the public backlash. Other popular products that contain palm oil include Cadbury's chocolate, Ben & Jerry’s ice cream and Clover spread, reported The Independent. The report by EFSA said palm oil is more carcinogenic than any other oil, echoing similar claims made by the World Health Organisation. Several retailers in Italy – including Coop, the country's biggest supermarket chain – have even boycotted the chocolate and hazelnut spread over the claims. But Ferrero, which makes the spread, has hit back by launching an advertising campaign to assure people that its product is safe. Nutella is the company's flagship product and makes up about a fifth of its sales, The Telegraph reported.

"Therefore the Contam panel did not set a safe level for GE.” These compounds can also be found in other vegetable oils, margarines and processed foods, but they are found in higher, potentially dangerous, amounts in palm oil, the ESFA report said.

According to a report by Amnesty International in November, global brands such as Colgate-Palmolive, Kellogg's, Nestlé, Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever have been using palm oil produced by children – some as young as eight – working on hazardous Indonesian plantations. It has a well-known harmful impact on the environment, too, having been linked to mass deforestation and the loss of habitats of endangered species such as orangutans. It's a sad state of affairs, but it's probably time to look for a healthier and more ethical alternative to our favourite chocolate spread.

That appears to be the thinking behind San Diego, Calif.-based retail technology firm Cloverleaf Media LLC, which today announced shelfPoint, a solution that replaces traditional shelf pricing stickers while simultaneously serving as a video ad platform and collecting customer engagement data. “Retail technology has shown a great deal of promise, particularly around gathering and using data more effectively,” Jan Murley, Cloverleaf’s chief strategy and marketing advisor, tells ITBusiness.ca. “Unfortunately most of that technology is triggered at the point of sale, after the shopper has finished his or her shopping. I think what makes us unique is that we’re the first technology-driven platform that engages a shopper where he or she is actually shopping – at the shelf.” Despite public perception that online shopping has taken over retail in recent years, the reality is that more than half of Canadian consumers still prefer shopping at physical stores, and in recent years a hybrid approach combining the two has taken centre stage, she says. Yet while multiple studies show that creating a digitally-driven experience at retail stores – using mobile devices, for example – pays dividends, Canadian retailers especially have been slow to keep up. With many U.S. retailers facing similar challenges, Cloverleaf’s mission when developing shelfPoint was twofold, Murley says: provide brands and retailers with a dynamic new display platform that brings their pricing information into the 21st century, while simultaneously building an analytics platform they can use to record their customers’ emotional reactions to a product, along with the moment they decide to purchase. “We call it the 10, five, and one,” she says. “At 10 feet, we need to stop you and grab your attention with a big, dynamic piece of communication. At five feet we’ve drawn you in and want to tell you more about what’s here and why you might like it, and at one foot we want to close the sale with a pricing or a promotional offer.” The shelfPoint platform can also be used for live A/B testing, giving marketing teams the opportunity to program multiple displays, optimizing each message for a specific demographic and evaluating their success. “We can learn whether message A is more powerful than message B, so we can keep optimizing the message for the particular target,” Murley explains. “Over time we will be able to modify the message we put out there based on who is shopping in front of the shelf – so if I am a brand and I want to attract millennials with one message, and soccer moms with the other, I can figure out how to differentiate my messages based on who is in front of the shelf at the time.” And privacy-minded customers needn’t worry – the focus is on mapping demographics and expressions, not personal details, she notes. Nothing is stored. “We only know you from the pixels in a template,” Murley says. “So there’s never any physical picture – what’s kept are the pixels, which map against the template with about an 80 per cent accuracy rate.” So far, the platform’s features include: Emotional Artificial Intelligence Technology: Leveraging a strategic partnership with “emotional AI” developer Affectiva, the shelfPoint platform uses optical sensors to classify each shopper’s facial expressions into one of 20 categories such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, or surprise without storing personal information or images. Demographic Capture Capabilities: shelfPoint’s sensors can also gather anonymous shopper demographic data including age, gender, and ethnic group. LCD Display: The platform includes high-definition LCD strips that run across an entire shelf, giving marketers a new platform they can use to attract, engage, and entice shoppers based on their distance, demographic, and engagement. Actionable Insights: Using Cloverleaf’s own cloud-based insights platform, shelfPoint can be used to analyze in-store data and deliver a detailed overview of key findings tailored to the retailer and/or brand’s needs. IT Agnostic Platform: CIOs will be happy to know that shelfPoint uses its own cloud-based, cellular-enabled media player and can thus easily integrate with just about any existing IT infrastructure, in addition to running independently of a store’s wireless Internet connection. All retailers need do is upload their pricing information to the platform, as Murley says attempting full integration with a store’s point-of-sale system would have been more trouble than it was worth. The company is happy to help clients make sense of their data as well, Murley says, depending on their needs: Proctor and Gamble, for example, has data crunchers working for them and prefers to receive raw information, while Red Bull representatives simply ask for the highlights. Eventually, she acknowledges, Cloverleaf hopes that its platform becomes widespread enough that it can serve as a customer analytics firm. “It’s like when Amazon started selling books,” she says. “We want to start with the shelf, because that’s the most productive place to build from.” Check out a demonstration of Cloverleaf’s shelfPoint solution, using Pepsi products, below.
