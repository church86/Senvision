Let’s See Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: September 26, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» As the craze for the launch of the iPhone 7 appears to be dimming a bit, the Apple MacBook Pro 2016 is the new centre of attention. It’s a highly expected and anticipated device and speculation suggests that the Cupertino-based tech company may reveal the device this October. Some advocate that Apple will most-likely wait for the Intel Kaby Lake processors, making the MacBook Pro 2016 a must-have. The possible launch of the MacBook Pro 2016 has now boosted previous reports that the much-awaited refresh is coming about this fall. Compile that with some hype from Apple CEO Tim Cook; MacBook Pro fans indeed have a reason to get excited. It has been more than 479 days since the MacBook Pro has had a refresh, so it’s not difficult to understand the eager anticipation as folks hope that the wait is worth it. The preceding months saw various rumours tied up to the MacBook Pro 2016. Among them one such rumour spoke about the popular features that the next Apple notebook will offer. The list includes OLED touch strips, Type-C USB ports, Touch ID, and a fingerprint scanner. The 13-inch MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air, run solely on integrated graphics bundled with Intel’s chips. The 15-inch MacBook Pro is available in two versions, a lower-end arrangement with only integrated graphics and the other, a higher-end configuration that adds an enhanced graphics chip for sophisticated performance. The 15-inch MacBook are furnished with both types of graphics, and can automatically switch between the two, judging whether better performance or better battery life is needed at the moment. Apple has generally used chips like Intel’s GT3 or GT3e for graphics performance, with the “e” suffix on the GT3e signifying embedded DRAM, on the chip,  improving performance. Compared to the GT3 tier, the GT3e delivers finer performance. If we consider Intel’s history, for chips outside Skylake, the 15-inch MacBook Pro faces a major problem. This is due to the fact that Intel has no plans for any quad-core chips with integrated graphics higher than the GT2 level. This essentially has about half the raw power of the GT3 tier, which will be a part of the next-generation Kaby Lake family of processors. As a result, the Skylake H-series chips, which is being currently offered on the 15-inch MacBook Pro – that we are also expecting to be updated next month – may remain as Intel’s lead offering for these types of high-performance mobile chips. Unless the new Coffee Lake chips are introduced in the second quarter of 2018! Even then the original Coffee Lake chips will comprise of only GT2-level graphics that may not be powerful enough for Apple’s requirements. Mobile & Apps, recently reported that Apple is planning on making the MacBook Pro 2016 thinner and lighter, plus it will also incorporate the innovative hinge design. There is also a possibility of more colour options. Apple seems very stern about removing the 3.5mm headphone jack from its future devices. Probably, as a way to show that the company has the guts to think ahead. Therefore, the MacBook Pro 2016, much like the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, may also sport the Bluetooth AirPods. According to Apple Insider, MacBook Pro 2016’s physical function keys may be replaced as well by an OLED display touch bar having modifiable software keys, which will adapt to the functions and needs of various apps.

Israel's largest high-tech company Intel Israel is moving its 2,500 development personnel into a new building in Petah Tikva. This 34,000 square meter building will learn the habits of every employee who chooses to disclose personal information, customize his working environment, help save energy and continue learning and improving over time. Among other things, the building will know what coffee to make for each employee, when to send him to get a haircut and recommend where to park. Today, Intel laid the cornerstone of its Petah Tikva campus, which is one of company’s most advanced buildings worldwide and is a living demonstration of the various technologies it develops. Upon its completion, the personnel working in this building will be able to control their environment and adjust it to their needs using thousands of sensors and advanced processing capabilities. In addition, the new building will have integrated systems encouraging a healthy lifestyle, energy conservation and a green environment. RELATED ARTICLES "Intel's Israel team has done it again" Mobileye, Intel and BMW to build self-driving cars Intel to close Jerusalem production plant Intel Israel hands out layoff notifications "The new building will bring together employees currently working in 13 buildings, and will enhance cooperation between the different groups," said Maxine Fassberg, Intel Israel CEO and Intel Group vice president. "The construction of this campus emphasizes the importance of our presence in Israel and reflects our values: innovation, technology and green construction. We have found real partners in the Petah Tikva Municipality, who have helped us realize this vision." The new building will house Intel's 2,500 development personnel working in central Israel and will be based on Internet of Things (IoT) technology, also developed in Intel. Further advanced technological products developed in Intel Israel will be integrated into this building, which will be built on a 34,000 square meter plot in Petah Tikva's Kiryat Arye industrial zone, not far from Intel's current Petah Tikva campus. The building will have nine floors, as well as a 32,000 square meter underground parking. It will also contain 3,500 square meters of electronic labs, three restaurants, a café, a gym, a spa, a hairdresser, a beauty salon and a learning and convention center. This will be a green building, with a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) platinum level certification, focusing on energy conservation and water recycling. The campus will be built as a 'learning building', which will constantly become more efficient, improving energy and water consumption, as well as the general operation of the building. As part of the focus on green construction, the R&D center will also contain covered parking for 120 bicycles, with adjacent showers. This building is highly accessible to public transportation, in line with Intel's green agenda, the first Israeli company which received the Ministry of Environmental Protection's sustainable building certification. By using a designated application, the employees who choose to do so will be able to use personalized services. For example, the application will offer employees living around the same area to carpool to work. An employee who comes to work with his car will be directed to the available parking which is closest to his meeting's location, in synchronization with his diary. The application will even learn the employee's coffee drinking habits and will thereby be able to offer him his favorite coffee and even order it in advance for the employee to pick from the lobby on the way to his office. One of the most noteworthy improvements offered by this building is the end to fights between employees over air conditioning. The building will study each employee's temperature preferences and, during a meeting, propose the temperature which is most accommodating for all participants. Lunches will also be based on studying employee behavior. First of all, the system will monitor the number of people eating and, if the dining room is busy, it will offer the employee to eat at another hour. In addition, the building could check, based on the employee's preferences, whether he will be interested in eating when his friends are also available. Moreover, the building will be capable of telling whether the employee's favorite dish is being served on a specific day and in which cafeteria. Every day, the screens will clearly show the employees' favorite dishes, and rating them will be possible. Employee time management and services offered by the building will not be limited to meals. Intel's new smart campus, like any other Intel campus, will have a gym, two restaurants, meat and dairy, a café in the lobby and, of course, an entire area devoted to campus services - spa, hairdresser, laundry services and more. An employee interested in a certain service could order it and receive a notification when the service is available. Moreover, the building will be able to learn the employee's habits - if he tends to get his hair cut every two months, it will send him an SMS when a haircut is due; if an employee works out in the gym, she will be able to receive recommendations for a menu suitable for her training regimen.

The Indian Express Nation World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Home Compare News Mobile & Tabs Gadgets Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech Reviews Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga review Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga review Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga, arguably the lightest business 2-in-1 in the world, has finally made its way to India. Here is our full review. Written by Nandagopal Rajan | Published:September 25, 2016 9:30 am Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga, arguably the lightest business 2-in-1 in the world, has finally made its way to India. The concept of the Ultrabook is about half a decade old. It started when Intel posted a reference design for manufacturers to follow. Ultrabooks had a big impact on the market by pushing for slimmer designs across price points and use cases. It also resulted in the convertibles segment, which is now called the 2-in-1s, or computing devices that can give users a better access to the screen by turning or tearing away. Intel as well as its manufacturing partners are still betting big on this segment to be a huge commercial success. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga was first announced at the CES in Las Vegas this year. The device, arguably the lightest business 2-in-1 in the world, has finally made its way to India. Though a part of the popular ThinkPad series, this device brings in the learnings from Lenovo’s popular Yoga series, especially the multiple forms it can take to facilitate presentation, work, creation and consumption. All thanks to a powerful hinge that holds the screen in place. Specs: 14-inch WQHD (2560 x 1440p) OLED touchscreen with 300 nits | 2.4GHz Intel Core i5-6200U processor with 4GB RAM | 126GB ROM | Windows 10 Pro 64-bit | USB x3, HDMI x 1 England 103/5 At Stumps On Day 2, Trailing India By 352 Runs Bigg Boss 10 November 17 Review: Swami Om Apologized From Mona Lisa Parliament Adjourned Amid Debate Over Demonetisation Issue Demonetisation: Select Petrol Pumps To Dispense Cash Up To Rs 2,000 Demonetisation: Here’s How It Affects Kerala Estate WorkersDemonetisation: Here’s How It Affects Kerala Estate Workers Miscreants Break Into SBI ATM In Odisha’s Nabarangpur District: Here’s What Happened Audience Reaction : John Abraham and Sonakshi Sinha Starrer Force 2 Gets A Thumbs Up Here’s What Supreme Court Said On Government’s Demonetisation Move Finance Minister Arun Jaitley Rules Out Roll Back Of Demonetisation Move West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal Protest Against Demonetisation Government Issues Fresh Guidelines On Withdrawal Norms: All You Need To Know Mamata Banerjee Demand Roll-back Of Demonetisation Within Three Days If Mulayam Singh’s Trust Is With Ram Gopal, I Am Also With Him: Amar Singh SYL Row: Amrinder Singh Seeks President’s Rule In Punjab Uproar In Parliament Over Demonetisation Debate: Here’s What Happened Price: Rs 1,12,000 What is good? The X1 Yoga has a stunning screen, mostly because it is 2K and one of the brightest displays you will see at 300 nits. This is the hero of this device as you will always have the screen in front as you use the different forms the laptop can take, especially when it is in the tablet mode. You will have no issues with viewing angles of sunlight when using the X1 Yoga. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga has a stunning screen, mostly because it is 2K and one of the brightest displays you will see at 300 nits. While there is a good touchscreen, most of us still prefer to use the old fashioned keyboard for inputs. The X1 Yoga has one of the best backlit keyboards in town, well spaced out and with the right amount of travel. The slightly curved keys are almost welcoming your fingertips, while the top row offers a range of functional keys that make life very easy. It has a very good trackpad with separate left, right clickers that are unique to Lenovo devices. Plus, there is a trackpad for those who prefer that instead of a touchscreen or mouse. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga has one of the best backlit keyboards in town, well spaced out and with the right amount of travel. The review device I had was running a Intel Core i5 processor and the performance was pretty good. However, this device can pack much more powerful Core i7 vPro version with 4GB RAM. So performance will not be an issue in anyway. The i5 version was also not underwhelming in any way and stays cool which is a good thing. Where this device has an edge over most of the competition is in its form factor and weight. While most powerful business laptops are still heavy and bulky this is thin and light while bringing in the versatility of the full foldable screen. Don’t forget that you will be paying a premium for this. What is not that good? Despite the stunning screen, the audio is underwhelming to put it mildly. With the screen facing you in the presentation form or in tent mode the audio is a bit more audible, but otherwise you will need headphones or an external speaker to enjoy this. Verdict The Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Yoga is a very powerful and versatile device. There is nothing really wrong with this 2-in-1 which ticks all the boxes. However, the price will ensure that this ends up as being an enterprise purchase for more people. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaBanks to work normal hours on Saturday, but only senior citizens can exchange old notes BusinessDemonetisation: Execution could not have been better, says Arun Jaitley IndiaDemonetisation: Misuse of bank account for black money deposit to invite govt action IndiaLong queues outside banks a ‘serious issue’, says SC on demonetisation IndiaPriyanka Gandhi to play 'major role' in UP Assembly polls: Congress EntertainmentForce 2 movie review: John Abraham, Sonakshi Sinha film is Bond-Bourne rehash EntertainmentChris Martin parties with Shah Rukh Khan, Sussanne Khan and Sridevi's daughters, see inside pics EntertainmentIt's November 18, Salman Khan's wedding day, see pics EntertainmentIulia Vantur reveals what she had to sacrifice to live in India.

By Hyacinth Mascarenhas September 24, 2016 09:18 BST Lenovo, Intel, Synaptics and PayPal have announced a partnership to bring established FIDO biometric authentic capabilities to PCs.iStock Lenovo, Intel, Synaptics and PayPal have announced a collaboration to bring FIDO-enabled fingerprint authentication to Lenovo computers. The new technology would allow people to use their fingerprints instead of a password to verify their identities while using online payment services such as PayPal. The new biometric authentication system will combine Lenovo's laptops with Intel's hardware security and Synaptic's biometric fingerprint technology, including encryption technologies and anti-spoofing algorithms. It will also be based on FIDO Alliance's – an industry association that has developed identity authentication standards and assesses the security of password alternatives – security standards. Founded in 2012 by Lenovoand PayPal among others, FIDO Alliance has been backed by numerous other major companies such as Google, Microsoft, Bank of America, American Express, Samsung and Qualcomm. "The average user has to remember passwords for many different accounts, from PC log-in, email to online shopping," Lenovo senior vice president of its PC and smart device business group Johnson Jia said in a statement. "We wanted to help change that by freeing users from the burden of remembering complex passwords by providing a simple authentication solution." The companies did not specify when laptops with the new fingerprinting technology for online payments would be released. However, they did mention that they would bring the new technology to its laptops beginning with the Yoga 910 convertible PC. Biometric technology has been growing rapidly as a promising new, reliable authentication solution to strengthen digital security and has been adopted by multiple institutions across the globe, particularly in the financial and banking sectors. Innovative biometric security solutions, such as fingerprint sensors, voice recognition, facial recognition and retinal scanning are viewed as a more reliable security options since they do not require a person to remember any information such as a password, PIN or token. Besides being easy to use, they also rely on data that make each person unique, making it much more difficult for hackers and digital thieves to fake. The companies' announcement also comes just a day after internet giant Yahoo disclosed that a massive data breach in 2014 compromised over 500 million user accounts. The company said the sensitive user information - including names, email addresses, phone numbers, birth dates and encrypted passwords - of about half a billion people was compromised by what it believed was a "state-sponsored actor."

of the key trends for market growth will be rise in investments in emerging memory technology. (EMAILWIRE.COM, September 24, 2016 ) Technavio Announces the Publication of its Research Report Global Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) SSD Market 2016-2020 Technavio recognizes the following companies as the key players in the global peripheral component interconnect express (PCIe) SSD market: Intel, Micron, Samsung, Seagate, Western Digital, and Toshiba. Other Prominent Vendors in the market are: ADATA, Apacer, IBM, Kingston Technology, Memblaze, Nimbus Data Systems, OCZ, SK Hynix, and Violin Memory. Browse full report with TOC@ https://marketreportscenter.com/reports/388335/global-pcle-ssd-market-2016-2020 Commenting on the report, an analyst from Technavios team said: One of the key trends for market growth will be rise in investments in emerging memory technology. The 3D NAND flash memory market is a new market where manufacturers are investing a lot of capital. Some companies such as Samsung, Micron, and Intel have already invested to extend their product portfolios. Toshiba, in collaboration with SanDisk, is investing huge funds to develop 3D NAND. Samsung, SanDisk, and Toshiba, and Intel and Micron are likely to invest more than $18 billion in the manufacturing of 3D NAND during the forecast period. Intel has plans to invest up to $5.5 billion to manufacture flash memory in its China-based memory chip plant during the forecast period. Hence, increasing investments in 3D NAND technology will boost the global PCIe SSD market during the forecast period. According to the report, need for managed service data centers will be a key driver for market growth. It is advantageous for an enterprise to operate a colocation facility rather than to build a data center. Data center colocation allows enterprises to rent computing storage, servers, and network. It enables minimal utilization of power and bandwidth and enhances the security of enterprise IT equipment. Further, the report states that the lack of availability of constant low latency is a major challenge. Write latency can be masked with write-back caching. However, read latency cannot be hidden. SSD latencies are usually for a couple of hundred microseconds. In certain cases, when access is interrupted by the device's internal tasks, SSD's latency can exceed tens of milliseconds or even to a few seconds. The situation is further complicated by the lack of coordination across an array of devices. This results in unpredictable performance of I/Os due to uncoordinated internal tasks. The study was conducted using an objective combination of primary and secondary information including inputs from key participants in the industry. The report contains a comprehensive market and vendor landscape in addition to a SWOT analysis of the key vendors. Request A Sample copy of This Report @ https://marketreportscenter.com/request-sample/388335 About Solid-State Drive A solid-state drive (SSD) is a kind of an electronic disk that is built out of silicon microchips and is used for data storage. It uses the same I/O interface design as hard disk drives and stores data in solid-state memory in the form of electric charge. It is made out of silicon microchips. Dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and negated AND (NAND) are most commonly used storage components used in many devices. Semiconductor-based devices such as NAND have no mechanical or moving parts. This reduces the risk of failure and allows higher read and write speeds in SSDs. The number of applications of SSDs has also increased as they can withstand extreme shocks, consume less power, deliver high consistency, and can be integrated into devices that are used in harsh environments. Technavios analysts forecast the global peripheral component interconnect express (PCIe) SSD market to grow at a CAGR of 33.24% during the period 2016-2020. Covered in this report The report covers the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global peripheral component interconnect express (PCIe) SSD market for 2016-2020. To calculate the market size, the report considers the revenue generated from the sale of PCIe SSDs to the enterprise segment. The market is divided into the following segments based on geography: Americas APAC EMEA Technavio's report, Global Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) SSD Market 2016-2020, has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs from industry experts. The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects over the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Lenovo, PayPal, Intel and Synaptics team up for fingerprint tech for online payments Lenovo has teamed up with Intel, PayPal, and Synaptics to bring FIDO authentication to laptops. The collaboration will enable Lenovo customers to be able to authenticate to online FIDO ((Fast Identity Online) )-enabled services like PayPal by using a fingerprint instead of a password. This innovative biometric authentication system for PCs will implement current FIDO standards, bringing established FIDO biometric authentication capabilities to the PC. The main aim of the new technology is to reduce fraud and increase security, while making online authentication nearly frictionless with biometrics secured by built-in, hardware-level protection. The companies’ collaboration will leverage Intel’s Software Guard Extensions via its 7th Gen Intel Core processors, and Synaptics’ Natural ID fingerprint sensors featuring TLS 1.2 encryption. Johnson Jia, senior vice president, PC & Smart Device Business Group, Lenovo said, The average user has to remember passwords for many different accounts, from PC log-in, email to online shopping. We wanted to help change that by freeing users from the burden of remembering complex passwords by providing a simple authentication solution. We’re excited to be the first PC company to partner with Intel, PayPal and Synaptics to bring users simpler and safer online authentication based on the released FIDO standards, through fingerprint readers designed for improved security on our laptops starting with the Yoga 910 convertible. Brett McDowell, executive director of the FIDO Alliance said, Passwords are a universal problem that is not limited to mobile devices.  Every internet connected device needs the ability to upgrade to simpler, stronger FIDO authentication and thanks to this partnership, the desktop ecosystem is on an accelerated path to get the same FIDO capabilities already well established across the mobile ecosystem. Lenovo did not mention when systems with the new fingerprint authentication technology will hit the market.

Everykey Tech & Science John McAfee Intel Cybersecurity pioneer John McAfee is fighting Intel to prove he still owns his own name, after the computing giant accused him of infringing on the “McAfee” trademark it owns. McAfee created the eponymous antivirus computer software, which Intel acquired in 2010, almost 20 years after selling his assets to the company. He has since become CEO of MGT Capital Investments and plans to rename the firm “John McAfee Global Technologies.” McAfee antivirus has since been renamed Intel Security, but Intel still warned McAfee earlier this year that any use of his name would infringe on the company’s trademark. Try Newsweek for only $1.25 per week “When MGT was renamed John McAfee Global Technologies, Intel sent a cease and desist order claiming they owned my name,” McAfee tells Newsweek. “In truth, when I formed McAfee Inc I signed over only the name ‘McAfee Antivirus.’ “Intel has been illegally using my name for every product that they sell,” McAfee says. “It never bothered me but now that they are trying to prevent me from using my name I’m pissed off.” McAfee and his new company MGT Capital filed a lawsuit against Intel on September 2, arguing that the Asset Acquisition Agreement from 1991 did not assign the rights to his personal name or agree to restrict his right to do business using his own name. Related Stories I May Be a Political Hot Shot but I’m No Charlie Sheen Mr. McAfee Goes to Washington How Artificial Intelligence Is Helping Japanese Farmers According to the lawsuit, MGT’s proposed name change is “a clear reference to McAfee as an individual and as a famed international figure in his own right.” Since selling his antivirus company, McAfee has had several business ventures and has remained consistently in the public eye. Earlier this year, McAfee sought the Libertarian Party nomination for the U.S. presidential election. The nomination was eventually won by former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson. Intel was not immediately available for comment.

Ogg September 25, 2016 10:25 am EST Print Email Tweet Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) may have received a lot of new cash from a capital raise and recently reworked its wafer supply agreement, and now analysts have started getting back on the AMD wagon after a sharp pullback. Oddly enough, rival Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) may be a driving force for AMD, even on top of AMD’s other ongoing long-term positives. Before chasing analyst calls unilaterally, it is important to understand that AMD’s recent trading was after a monumental run of more than 300%. Then came AMD’s dilutive financing via stock and convertible debt sales. It is also important to understand that many analysts get their upside theses wrong, and sometimes they just ride a bull for long enough that they forgot about the horns. AMD has a 52-week trading range of $1.65 to $8.00. Its consensus analyst price target is now $6.12, according to Thomson Reuters. That consensus target was $6.01 a week ago, $5.25 a month ago, $5.19 two months ago and $3.95 at the end of June. Here are some of the recent positive AMD analyst calls, tempered with some cautious calls so investors get both sides of the coin. AMD saw a key Sell-equivalent rating removed by Bernstein on September 20. The firm raised AMD to Market Perform from Underperform and raised its target price to $5 from $3. AMD shares were last seen flat at $6.16 ahead of that call. The prior day brought a big call from the likes of Jefferies, which reiterated a Buy rating and a whopping $9 price target. Jefferies reflected upon AMD’s recent debt and equity financing, noting multiple catalysts ahead and that the Street has not fully caught on here. Even before Intel raised its guidance, MKM Partners reiterated its Buy rating and $8 price target on AMD on September 7. This was after the revised wafer supply deal with GlobalFoundries and was after the financing of debt and stock was at least known. MKM Partners said: The launch of margin-rich Zen server solutions should close the architecture gap with Intel (INTC, Buy, $36.08, $40 PT), and help stabilize and then increase their share of the x86 server market. We maintain our Buy rating and $8 price target (implies 1.76x multiple to our EV/FY17 Sales estimate). On September 11, Canaccord Genuity reiterated its Buy rating and its $8.50 price target. It also acknowledged Intel’s threat, but its thesis said: While we recognize that roadmap execution, competition and financial risks remain, we remain impressed with the new management team and still anticipate a quick recovery to solid profitability given prospects for topline growth given a much stronger product roadmap and due to lower expense levels necessitated by the company’s recent struggles. Finally, we believe risk/reward for AMD shares remains unbalanced to the upside despite the recent stock move and could quickly recover from recent volatility. We reiterate our BUY rating and $8.50 price target and would be buyers of any stock weakness following the announcement of these strategically important long-term moves. More recently, Standard & Poor’s equity team reiterated their Hold rating and $6 price target. Their September 17 note said: Our 12-month target price of $6.00 is based on a price-to-sales ratio of 1.1X our 2017 sales per share estimate, a steep discount to peers, but near its ten-year historical average. A discount to peers is warranted, we think, given its lack of profitability. Also on September 13, Deutsche Bank remained cautious. The firm has a Hold rating and a $5 price target. The cautious view said: AMD benefits from interest savings and pushes out the maturity of the next tranche of debt to 2022; however, it also dilutes its current shareholders by as much as ~30% between the new equity/convertible and the recently-issued warrants to Mubadala. Overall, while we applaud AMD’s recent execution on products, IP and profitability, we believe the core challenges of the company remain. Merrill Lynch remains among the most cautious and negative on AMD. Its team has an Underperform rating on AMD (and a Buy rating on Intel and NVIDIA). Their price target is $5, but even that target was raised in the recent months. Even the more cautious analysts have recently raised AMD target prices. Now just keep in mind that AMD shares are up 128% year to date and up 280% from this time a year ago. That is not normal, even for AMD. A gain like that also means that much of AMD’s coming good news is already at least partly baked into the cake here. Thomson Reuters does not have AMD expected to be profitable on an earnings per share (reported, not GAAP) until 2018. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Jon C.

Sep 25th 2016, 8:00 AM 20,041 Views 18 Comments Share25 Tweet Email5 Image: James Crombie/INPHO SITTING ACROSS THE table from Enda McNulty, I catch myself early on. We’ve all seen the clip. Hundreds of times. ’We fight for that inch’. We get it. The motivational techniques, the inspirational stuff – it tends to irritate us after a while. We’re wary of over-complicating. We remain steadfastly suspicious of keeping an open-mind. It’s not long before the begrudgery and sneering starts. McNulty, more than most, knows all about that scene from Any Given Sunday. His former Armagh coach Joe Kernan used to show it to the players on the team bus throughout that monumental 2002 All-Ireland campaign. Video (http://www.youtube.com/watch=m_iKg7nutNY&t=) Source: umterps3511/YouTube So McNulty is long past sneering. His father graduated from Queen’s University with a degree in psychology. Since his teens, he’s been heavily immersed in the topic. He didn’t need any encouragement from Kernan when it came to clawing with his fingernails for that inch. Years before the Cork hurlers wore red wristbands with ‘Gach Uile Liathroid’ written on them, Armagh were already at it. McNulty would go further. He’d have individual letters on his wrist tape. Each letter corresponded to something he wanted to achieve during the game. In certain circles, there’s been an inevitably raised-eyebrow regarding McNulty’s subsequent career as a high-performance specialist. In 2005, he established Motiv8 and began advising a host of sports clients. His and the company’s reputation quickly skyrocketed to such an extent that it now employs 30 people and 90% of its business is gleaned from the corporate sector. The easy thing is to sneer, of course. Less than a minute into our conversation, I do. McNulty references ‘clutch or pressure moments’. And I catch myself. Buzz words already. Cliches already. But the more McNulty talks, the more he veers away from convention. The way he analyses elite performance is a marked contrast from the norm. It’s studious and forensic and absorbing. Sometimes, it’s scientific. Sometimes not. But it’s always engaging. “Either we heal as a team or we are going to crumble”. He’s passionate about collaboration, something he feels doesn’t happen enough in Ireland. Instead of following the think-tank model that exists in other countries, he thinks we’re resting on our laurels. Waiting for inspiration rather than going out and finding it. “We don’t have enough of a collaborative approach to performance”, he says. I’m not just talking about sport. One of the organisations we work with is Intel. Can you imagine what we can learn from them? Intel have one of the leading manufacturing plants in the world. They are producing world-leading performance every single day. Another of our clients is Riverdance. Padraic Moyles is the lead dancer. I believe soccer players can learn a lot from Riverdance. This guy has done over 5,500 performances. That’s a lot of caps. We haven’t learned enough from GB in what they’re doing in terms of that joined-up approach from what they can learn from the best performance crucibles in the world. We’re too insular. We need to take the blinkers off. We need to take a tin-opener to the top of our minds and say ‘What is possible?’ We’ve got some of the most talented athletes in the world. We’ve got some of the most amazing sports organisations in the world. If we’d only bang our heads together and have positive collisions.” “We are in hell right now, gentlemen, believe me. And we can stay here and get the shit kicked out of us or we can fight our way back into the light.” Psychology is a sexy, modern facet of sport. Like analytics. But it can often be used as a mere PR exercise rather than a coherent element of a long-term performance strategy. In 2014, just prior to the World Cup in Brazil, the FA brought in the renowned sports psychiatrist Steve Peters to work with the England players. He was tasked with conjuring a miracle with limited, controlled access to the group. It was always a long-shot. “I think a lot of things in sport are about the optics more than the substance”, McNulty says. Source: Jonathan Brady “The best performance organisations in the world make sure everything is tied together. It becomes a fabric of the culture. Team GB in the Olympics – the sports psychologists wouldn’t have been a once-off, a one-hit wonder. It would’ve been the last eight years. I was in Loughborough University with David Gillick about 10 years ago and at that stage, the athletes were working with sports psychologists in advance of the London Olympics and they’ve been consistent with that right up to the present day. I think the English soccer team is a prime example of a team that choked under pressure, that weren’t ready mentally, that have consistently under-performed on big occasions, that have malfunctioned now coming up on six World Cup/European Championships. It’s incredible. So how can we have one of the most experienced brain mechanics in the world working with a team that needed a brain mechanic and they’ve consistently under-performed? “It’s not just psychological. It’s cultural, it’s technical, it’s tactical, it’s leadership. I found the lack of technical skills more amazing than the mental. The teams I played on – we knew being mentally tough wasn’t good enough. You could have the most mentally tough team in the world but no leaders. I can be calm, composed, concentrated, confident in the last five minutes but if I don’t know how to scream at my full-back line to say ‘Step up guys – do whatever you need to do to get the ball in the next tackle here’…The leadership needs to be merged with the mental toughness. With English soccer, I don’t believe it’s just the mental frailties of the team. There are not enough leaders on the park – you saw that against Iceland. Where were the leaders? Did you see anyone rally the troops? Did you see anyone screaming like Kevin McManamon at Croke Park this year? Did you see anyone communicating? Did you see anyone bringing the guys in and making the midfield cohesive? I didn’t see any sign of it.” Elite performers have the capability to immediately refocus after an error. It’s quickly forgotten about it, erased from the memory bank. Even across various strands of performance, the rules remain the same among the best. “There’s a similar technique but it varies how it’s executed”, McNulty says. Source: PA WIRE “Dan Carter, after a mistake, will do this (slaps his thigh)  - which means ‘Delete the mistake’. It’s a little trigger mechanism to get back into the moment. Some of the elite Irish rugby players we work with are incredible at getting a breath at the right moment to centre them in the middle of the now. One, deep, quality centering breath that settles you into what’s happening here and now.” Still, even the best can freeze. “Now I can’t make you do it. You gotta look at the guy next to you. Look into his eyes. Now, I think you are going to see a guy who will go that inch with you. You are going to see a guy who will sacrifice himself for this team because he knows when it comes down to it, you are gonna do the same thing for him.” In his autobiography ‘Red’, Gary Neville discusses his 85-cap England career. He refers to it as a ‘waste of time’, detailing how too many players were plagued by the fear of failure rather than motivated by the prospect of success. ‘Motivation’ is a term flippantly thrown around sports discussions. But it’s a nuanced concept. For Dave Brailsford, GM of Team Sky, he argues that elite performers will train even without feeling motivated. It’s the commitment to the craft that’s the crucial step. Carlo Ancelotti says a manager’s job is to demotivate players, that the elite are self-motivated and individually driven – not coaxed into producing top performances. And yet, occasionally, some athletes will push harder in response to negative comments or perceived criticism. But that’s only a ‘short-term motivator’, according to McNulty. “I met Arsene Wenger about three or four years ago at a conference and he spoke about motivational stamina”, he says. Source: PA ARCHIVE IMAGES “What does that mean? Well, it’s easy to activate someone’s motivation. We can all be motivated for the next month – get fit, get lean or do extras on the football pitch or the golf course. That’s activation. But intensity of the activation. Is it high intensity of motivation (raises voice to a roar) – ‘We’ll fucking do whatever it takes to be unbelievably successful every single day’ or (drops voice) is it low intensity motivation where we don’t really give a damn? “And then there’s the consistency of the motivation. Someone’s negative comments in the media gives you a little spurt. Maybe for a night. I don’t believe, from spending my whole life in this space, that you can drive yourself for 10 or 12 years on what someone said in the media. The best coaches – the Fergusons, the Mourinhos, the Codys, the Phil Jacksons, the Joe Schmidts, even going back to Barcelona and what that club was built on in the early days – I don’t think it was built on what somebody said in the media. It was built on that sweet spot of motivation which is striving every day to be the best you can be. That’s sustainable. It’s something that can give you energy every day. I would never set out to motivate someone negatively. Let’s get into the middle of the arteries of the players’ motivation rather than being on the veneer of the surface of some bullshit.” Consistency. Being the best. We were the best at boxing. But what happened in Rio? Why did the performance levels drop? Too many distractions? “I wouldn’t say it was only social media but a medley of small factors,” McNulty says. “Obviously Billy Walsh, the uncertainty over the last 12 months, maybe that every sports organisation in the world – even the one I played under in Armagh – when you raise the bar and become very successful, if you don’t raise the bar again the next year or over the next four years, you’re going to get obliterated”. “In any fight it is the guy who is willing to die who is going to win that inch.” Social media is becoming an increasingly sizable issue for McNulty and other performance consultants to get to grips with. Some athletes find it difficult to let go. There’s a dependency. “In some cases, we’ve found it scary, to be honest”, McNulty says. You could have an athlete coming to you on the morning of a major, major sporting event – we’re talking about the biggest you can imagine – and they’re saying ‘I just can’t believe this trend about me across social media this week – I’m really gutted by it.’ Or, ‘It’s really heightening my own expectations – they’re saying there’s a big contract on the line because of this performance.’  So we’re meeting that on a really, really frequent basis. In fact, when it’s not mentioned we’re more surprised. “My approach to social media before an Olympics or before a major tournament would be that it needs to be strongly tapered down. The same way a strength and conditioning coach would talk about tapering down a week or two before a tournament. Similarly, their mental conditioning would be tapered down – we’re not going to give them a lot of mental preparation a week before a big event. Social media should be tapered down so that it’s non-existent two days before. That’s what the best athletes are doing, by the way. They’re literally switching off. They don’t have the tweets coming through, they don’t have the Facebook messages coming through. They delete the apps from their phones for those three days. “The young superstars we work with are amazing at that. The players who may have been inconsistent in their performances would say ‘Well, I like my social media the day before – I like to log on and tweet and browse’. We’re saying ‘Sorry – why are you doing that? That doesn’t make any sense’. You’d never tell someone not to do it because it’s too much like a school teacher and authoritarian. You would try and say to them ‘Let’s understand why we’re asking you to taper it down significantly’”. McNulty talks a lot about the preparation timeline for athletes and how the days immediately before an event should be calm and composed, both mentally and physically. By that stage, the hard work should be done. Trying to cram before a big exam is always unhelpful and stressful. “The computer should be programmed three days before the big performance”, he says. Source: Morgan Treacy/INPHO “At that stage – as we tell the athletes or performers – close it. Take everything off the table. You’re ready to perform. Physically, mentally, technically, emotionally, tactically – you’re ready. Rather than the night before – ‘I’m going to do my visualisation’. Or the night before – ‘I have to get myself ready for those moments that matter in the last 30 seconds’. It’s too late. At that stage, the game is over. It’s like me trying to get fit the night before an All-Ireland final. It’s not going to happen. If you’re trying to fine-tune your skills the night before an All-Ireland final, you’re in trouble. I come at this from a place of pain. Three nights before the All-Ireland final in 2003, I was on a pitch working with a coach in a 1-on-1 to help me get sharper in preparation for marking Peter Canavan. And it was an unmitigated disaster. This old coach of mine – Dessie Ryan – is the best defensive coach I’ve come across. He was getting my footwork fine-tuned, my hands fine-tuned, getting me mentally fine-tuned – amazing coaching. The problem was it was the wrong time. It should’ve been two weeks before, not three days. I went into that final with a flu because I was tired, jaded and had done too much work.” “The margin for error is so small. I mean, one half step too late or too early you don’t quite make it. One half second too slow or too fast and you don’t quite catch it. The inches we need are everywhere around us.”  The search for the inches has led to a significant rise in sports science, performance psychology, data analysis across professional and amateur performance. Can McNulty envisage a time when coaches will return to sticking the back page of the local newspaper on the dressing-room wall as a motivational tool? Or when man-management reverts to allowing the players a few beers on their way to a game? “I remember an old mental coach of mine back in the day using the phrase ‘The revolution is going to be back to basics’”, he says. “Our technology, our sports sciences, the sophistication in terms of our preparation is now almost 10x what it was when I finished playing four years ago. It’s incredible. But the basics still apply. All the other stuff is really only window-dressing. Get the basics right 99.9 times out of 100 and you’ll stand out in any performance crucible. Is it your tackle technique in rugby? As a Gaelic footballer, is it keeping your man scoreless? I can do all the other sexy, cool stuff but if I can’t keep Peter Canavan scoreless then I shouldn’t be on the team. I think sometimes we lose our focus on that but it will never be taken away from us.” The42 is on Snapchat! Tap the button below on your phone to add!

XDC2016 Wraps Up After Many Wayland, X.Org & Mesa Discussions Written by Michael Larabel in Events on 24 September 2016. Page 1 of 1. 2 Comments The 2016 X.Org Developers' Conference (XDC2016) wrapped up Friday in Helsinki, Finland. Here is a summary of the major happenings for those that may have missed it or didn't yet watch the video streams. NVIDIA - NVIDIA is working towards HDR display support on Linux. NVIDIA already supports HDR displays on Windows and Android but for Linux support they and other stakeholders must agree to some common relevant APIs and design decisions about supporting this next generation of displays. - NVIDIA presented over their device memory/surface allocation API thoughts and with the GBM vs. EGLStreams debate panning out for what API(s) would be used by Wayland compositors, ultimately there is some agreement that there is room for a new API to build upon the best of GBM, EGL, Gralloc, Vulkan, etc. This could take some time but they've already made some progress in the new API's design. Nouveau - Aside from official NVIDIA talks, Nouveau developers were they and shared their frustrations over NVIDIA's firmware practices since Maxwell. It's a mess but there will hopefully be some change in the future. - There was also the Nouveau status update that aside from talking about NVIDIA's firmware blobs covered some work being done on SPIR-V, their goal to have OpenGL 4.5 support, their overall focus on GL and performance, and how there probably won't be a Nouveau Vulkan driver soon. - There was also a talk dedicated to Nouveau power management and how Linux 4.9 will be a bit more exciting for Nouveau users thanks to some of the boost patches finally landing. Wayland - There was the interesting talk about Google's use of the Wayland protocol within the Android Runtime for Chrome (ARC++). It will be interesting to see what else Google does with Wayland in the months ahead, especially considering they are now employing the Wayland founder and some other past contributors from Intel, etc. Intel - Intel's FastUIDraw is very promising for GPU-accelerated 2D drawing with a focus on web content. Early tests show FastUIDraw being much faster than Cairo, Qt, and other common drawing interfaces. - Another 2D-related talk and by an Intel developer, Martin Peres, was about the current state of the X11 2D acceleration. - Meanwhile, another Intel presentation was talking about their Vulkan driver anatomy. The early part of the presentation does cover a lot of the basics that frequent Phoronix readers are already familiar with, but the back half is more interesting with talking about more low-level design decisions, etc. AMD DAL - The only AMD presentation at XDC2016 was about the DAL display abstraction layer. Unfortunately, it's still not ready for the mainline Linux kernel yet it's needed for delivering a lot of modern display features to the AMD Linux stack. Other - A former GSoC developer talked about his work on a "soft" FP64 library for Mesa that will hopefully soon be able to emulate ARB_gpu_shader_fp64 support. - A variety of other interesting talks including about Wayland and Vulkan on Tizen, PRIME sync, and the GLVND vendor neutral dispatch library, among others. Aside from my numerous articles covering XDC2016 topics, there is also the XDC2016 video streams on YouTube for those interested. With XDC2016 a wrap, XDC2017 is to be hosted in Mountain View by Google. Enjoyed all my posts this week about XDC2016 from monitoring the livestream?

Encrypted iTunes backups created on a Mac or PC are protected by a password that can potentially be brute forced by password cracking software. The backup method in iOS 10 "skips certain security checks," allowing Elcomsoft to try backup passwords "approximately 2500 times faster" compared to iOS 9 and earlier operating systems. Obtaining the password for an iTunes backup provides access to all data on the phone, including that stored in Keychain, which holds all of a user's passwords and other sensitive information. At this time, we have an early implementation featuring CPU-only recovery. The new security check is approximately 2,500 times weaker compared to the old one that was used in iOS 9 backups. At this time, we are getting these speeds: iOS 9 (CPU): 2,400 passwords per second (Intel i5) iOS 9 (GPU): 150,000 passwords per second (NVIDIA GTX 1080) iOS 10 (CPU): 6,000,000 passwords per second (Intel i5)In specific terms, security analyst Per Thorsheim of Peerlyst says Apple has switched from using a PBKDF2 hashing algorithm with 10,000 iterations to using a SHA256 algorithm with a single iteration, allowing for a significant speed increase when brute forcing a password. Image via Peerlyst In a statement given to Forbes, Apple confirmed it is aware of the issue and is working on a fix. "We're aware of an issue that affects the encryption strength for backups of devices on iOS 10 when backing up to iTunes on the Mac or PC. We are addressing this issue in an upcoming security update. This does not affect iCloud backups," a spokesperson said. "We recommend users ensure their Mac or PC are protected with strong passwords and can only be accessed by authorized users. Additional security is also available with FileVault whole disk encryption."As Apple points out, this security oversight is limited to backups created on a Mac or PC and does not affect the security of iCloud backups. Most users likely do not need to worry about this issue as it requires access to the Mac or PC that was used to make the backup. Apple has updates for iOS 10 and macOS Sierra in the works, and it's possible a fix will be included in the new versions of the software. iOS 10.1 and macOS Sierra 10.12.1 were seeded to developers and public beta testers earlier this week. Related Roundup: iOS 10 [ 218 comments ] Top Rated Comments (View all) joshwenke 8 weeks ago Physical access to ANY machine is a security risk, no matter how strong password encryption is. Rating: 20 Votes dwsolberg 8 weeks ago I love Apple, but this sort of thing is so frustrating from a company that is trying to make privacy be such a huge part of its brand. Without security, privacy cannot exist. It doesn't have a huge effect on me, but it lowers my level of trust that Apple knows what it's doing. As a developer, this is a pretty glaring flaw, so I can only assume (or hope, rather) it was a temporary implementation that accidentally got through to a release version. Whatever happened, it's bizarre. Rating: 16 Votes cicalinarrot 8 weeks ago They must hurry up. Yahoo was lucky enough their stocks were already worth nothing before the hacking. Rating: 16 Votes Hanzu Lao 8 weeks ago Pretty lazy on their part. Rating: 13 Votes Northgrove 8 weeks ago But this is NOT physical access to the iPhone. They are talking about decrypting the BACKUP data. This data is typically on e hard drive on a PC or Mac or maybe in Apple's iCloud This is iTunes backups. Most don't use iTunes backups these days, even fewer would have had time to make one for iOS 10. While this doesn't demand physical access to an iPhone, it seems to me like it would demand physical access to a PC or Mac (and only a PC or Mac, not an iPhone or iPad).

Decrypt FileVault 2 Volumes FileVault 2 is a whole-disk encryption scheme used in Apple’s Mac OS X. FileVault 2 protects the entire startup partition with secure 256-bit XTS-AES encryption. If the user forgets their account password, or if the encrypted volume is moved to a different computer, a FileVault 2 can be unlocked with a special Recovery Key. If the user logs in with their Apple ID credentials, the Recovery Key can be saved into the user’s iCloud account. Should the user forget their password, the system can automatically use the Recovery Key to unlock the encrypted volume. It is important to note that Apple does not allow the end user to view or extract FileVault 2 recovery keys from iCloud. Elcomsoft Phone Breaker can extract FileVault 2 recovery keys from the user’s iCloud account, and use these keys to decrypt encrypted disk images. Valid authentication credentials (Apple ID/password or iCloud authentication token) as well as volume identification information extracted from the FileVault-encrypted disk image are required.

SHA256 is a very fast algorithm, meant to produce hashes for dictionaries and sets and whatnot - basically, it helps make all your programs run quickly. Normally quicker is better, so SHA256 is preferable in almost all situations, except when it comes to storing your password. Either someone made an honest mistake and thought, hey, lets make this run faster because faster is better and they didn't consider the implications of hacking being faster, or they intentionally wanted to cripple security.

Clayton Cotterell for WIRED It was December 2012, and Doug Burger was standing in front of Steve Ballmer, trying to predict the future. Ballmer, the big, bald, boisterous CEO of Microsoft, sat in the lecture room on the ground floor of Building 99, home base for the company’s blue-sky R&D lab just outside Seattle. The tables curved around the outside of the room in a U-shape, and Ballmer was surrounded by his top lieutenants, his laptop open. Burger, a computer chip researcher who had joined the company four years earlier, was pitching a new idea to the execs. He called it Project Catapult. Doug Burger. Clayton Cotterell for WIRED The tech world, Burger explained, was moving into a new orbit. In the future, a few giant Internet companies would operate a few giant Internet services so complex and so different from what came before that these companies would have to build a whole new architecture to run them. They would create not just the software driving these services, but the hardware, including servers and networking gear. Project Catapult would equip all of Microsoft’s servers—millions of them—with specialized chips that the company could reprogram for particular tasks. But before Burger could even get to the part about the chips, Ballmer looked up from his laptop. When he visited Microsoft Research, Ballmer said, he expected updates on R&D, not a strategy briefing. “He just started grilling me,” Burger says. Microsoft had spent 40 years building PC software like Windows, Word, and Excel. It was only just finding its feet on the Internet. And it certainly didn’t have the tools and the engineers needed to program computer chips—a task that’s difficult, time consuming, expensive, and kind of weird. Microsoft programming computer chips was like Coca Cola making shark fin soup. The current incarnation of Project Catapult. Clayton Cotterell for WIRED Burger—trim, only slightly bald, and calmly analytical, like so many good engineers—pushed back. He told Ballmer that companies like Google and Amazon were already moving in this direction. He said the world’s hardware makers wouldn’t provide what Microsoft needed to run its online services. He said that Microsoft would fall behind if it didn’t build its own hardware. Ballmer wasn’t buying it. But after awhile, another voice joined the discussion. This was Qi Lu, who runs Bing, Microsoft’s search engine. Lu’s team had been talking to Burger about reprogrammable computer chips for almost two years. Project Catapult was more than possible, Lu said: His team had already started. Today, the programmable chips that Burger and Lu believed would transform the world—called field programmable gate arrays—are here. FPGAs already underpin Bing, and in the coming weeks, they will drive new search algorithms based on deep neural networks—artificial intelligence modeled on the structure of the human brain—executing this AI several orders of magnitude faster than ordinary chips could. As in, 23 milliseconds instead of four seconds of nothing on your screen. FPGAs also drive Azure, the company’s cloud computing service. And in the coming years, almost every new Microsoft server will include an FPGA. That’s millions of machines across the globe. “This gives us massive capacity and enormous flexibility, and the economics work,” Burger says. “This is now Microsoft’s standard, worldwide architecture.” Catapult team members Adrian Caulfield, Eric Chung, Doug Burger, and Andrew PutnamClayton Cotterell for WIRED This isn’t just Bing playing catch-up with Google. Project Catapult signals a change in how global systems will operate in the future. From Amazon in the US to Baidu in China, all the Internet giants are supplementing their standard server chips—central processing units, or CPUs—with alternative silicon that can keep pace with the rapid changes in AI. Microsoft now spends between $5 and $6 billion a year for the hardware needed to run its online empire. So this kind of work is “no longer just research,” says Satya Nadella, who took over as Microsoft’s CEO in 2014. “It’s an essential priority.” That’s what Burger was trying to explain in Building 99. And it’s what drove him and his team to overcome years of setbacks, redesigns, and institutional entropy to deliver a new kind of global supercomputer. A Brand New, Very Old Kind of Computer Chip In December of 2010, Microsoft researcher Andrew Putnam had left Seattle for the holidays and returned home to Colorado Springs. Two days before Christmas, he still hadn’t started shopping. As he drove to the mall, his phone rang. It was Burger, his boss. Burger was going to meet with Bing execs right after the holiday, and he needed a design for hardware that could run Bing’s machine learning algorithms on FPGAs. Putnam pulled into the nearest Starbucks and drew up the plans. It took him about five hours, and he still had time for shopping. Burger, 47, and Putnam, 39, are both former academics. Burger spent nine years as a professor of computer science at the University of Texas, Austin, where he specialized in microprocessors and designed a new kind of chip called EDGE. Putnam had worked for five years as a researcher at the University of Washington, where he experimented with FPGAs, programmable chips that had been around for decades but were mostly used as a way of prototyping other processors. Burger brought Putnam to Microsoft in 2009, where they started exploring the idea that these chips could actually accelerate online services. Project Catapult Version 1, or V1, the hardware that Doug Burger and team tested in a data center on Microsoft’s Seattle campus. Clayton Cotterell for WIRED Even their boss didn’t buy it. “Every two years, FGPAs are ‘finally going to arrive,’” says Microsoft Research vice president Peter Lee, who oversees Burger’s group. “So, like any reasonable person, I kind of rolled my eyes when this was pitched.” But Burger and his team believed this old idea’s time had come, and Bing was the perfect test case. Microsoft’s search engine is a single online service that runs across thousands of machines. Each machine is driven by a CPU, and though companies like Intel continue to improve them, these chips aren’t keeping pace with advances in software, in large part because of the new wave in artificial intelligence. Services like Bing have outstripped Moore’s Law, the canonical notion that the number of transistors in a processor doubles every 18 months. Turns out, you can’t just throw more CPUs at the problem. But on the other hand, it’s generally too expensive to create specialized, purpose-built chips for every new problem. FPGAs bridge the gap. They let engineers build chips that are faster and less energy-hungry than an assembly-line, general-purpose CPU, but customizable so they handle the new problems of ever-shifting technologies and business models. At that post-holiday meeting, Burger pitched Bing’s execs on FPGAs as a low-power way of accelerating searches. The execs were noncommittal. So over the next several months, Burger and team took Putnam’s Christmas sketch and built a prototype, showing that it could run Bing’s machine learning algorithms about 100 times faster. “That’s when they really got interested,” says Jim Larus, another member of the team back then who’s now a dean at Switzerland’s École Polytechnique Fédérale in Lausanne. “They also started giving us a really hard time.” Tech Titan Architectures The Epic Story of Dropbox’s Exodus From the Amazon Cloud Empire Netflix Isn’t Made for the US Anymore—It’s for the Whole World Intel Reinvents Itself to Stay King in a Changing World The prototype was a dedicated box with six FPGAs, shared by a rack full of servers. If the box went on the frizz, or if the machines needed more than six FPGAs—increasingly likely given the complexity of the machine learning models—all those machines were out of luck. Bing’s engineers hated it. “They were right,” Larus says. So Burger’s team spent many more months building a second prototype. This one was a circuit board that plugged into each server and included only one FPGA. But it also connected to all the other FPGA boards on all the other servers, creating a giant pool of programmable chips that any Bing machine could tap into. That was the prototype that got Qi Lu on board. He gave Burger the money to build and test over 1,600 servers equipped with FPGAs. The team spent six months building the hardware with help from manufacturers in China and Taiwan, and they installed the first rack in an experimental data center on the Microsoft campus. Then, one night, the fire suppression system went off by accident. They spent three days getting the rack back in shape—but it still worked. Over several months in 2013 and 2014, the test showed that Bing’s “decision tree” machine-learning algorithms ran about 40 times faster with the new chips. By the summer of 2014, Microsoft was publicly saying it would soon move this hardware into its live Bing data centers. And then the company put the brakes on. Searching for More Than Bing Bing dominated Microsoft’s online ambitions in the early part of the decade, but by 2015 the company had two other massive online services: the business productivity suite Office 365 and the cloud computing service Microsoft Azure. And like all of their competitors, Microsoft executives realized that the only efficient way of running a growing online empire is to run all services on the same foundation. If Project Catapult was going to transform Microsoft, it couldn’t be exclusive to Bing. It had to work inside Azure and Office 365, too. The problem was, Azure executives didn’t care about accelerating machine learning. They needed help with networking. The traffic bouncing around Azure’s data centers was growing so fast, the service’s CPUs couldn’t keep pace. Eventually, people like Mark Russinovich, the chief architect on Azure, saw that Catapult could help with this too—but not the way it was designed for Bing. His team needed programmable chips right where each server connected to the primary network, so they could process all that traffic before it even got to the server. The first prototype of the FPGA architecture was a single box shared by a rack of servers (Version 0). Then the team switched to giving individual servers their own FPGAs (Version 1). And then they put the chips between the servers and the overall network (Version 2).WIRED So the FPGA gang had to rebuild the hardware again. With this third prototype, the chips would sit at the edge of each server, plugging directly into the network, while still creating pool of FPGAs that was available for any machine to tap into. That started to look like something that would work for Office 365, too. Project Catapult was ready to go live at last. Larus describes the many redesigns as an extended nightmare—not because they had to build a new hardware, but because they had to reprogram the FPGAs every time. “That is just horrible, much worse than programming software,” he says. “Much more difficult to write. Much more difficult to get correct.” It’s finicky work, like trying to change tiny logic gates on the chip. Now that the final hardware is in place, Microsoft faces that same challenge every time it reprograms these chips. “It’s a very different way of seeing the world, of thinking about the world,” Larus says. But the Catapult hardware costs less than 30 percent of everything else in the server, consumes less than 10 percent of the power, and processes data twice as fast as the company could without it. The rollout is massive. Microsoft Azure uses these programmable chips to route data. On Bing, which an estimated 20 percent of the worldwide search market on desktop machines and about 6 percent on mobile phones, the chips are facilitating the move to the new breed of AI: deep neural nets. And according to one Microsoft employee, Office 365 is moving toward using FPGAs for encryption and compression as well as machine learning—for all of its 23.1 million users. Eventually, Burger says, these chips will power all Microsoft services. Wait—This Actually Works? “It still stuns me,” says Peter Lee, “that we got the company to do this.” Lee oversees an organization inside Microsoft Research called NExT, short for New Experiences and Technologies. After taking over as CEO, Nadella personally pushed for the creation of this new organization, and it represents a significant shift from the 10-year reign of Ballmer. It aims to foster research that can see the light of day sooner rather than later—that can change the course of Microsoft now rather than years from now. Project Catapult is a prime example. And it is part of a much larger change across the industry. “The leaps ahead,” Burger says, “are coming from non-CPU technologies.” Peter Lee. Clayton Cotterell for WIRED All the Internet giants, including Microsoft, now supplement their CPUs with graphics processing units, chips designed to render images for games and other highly visual applications. When these companies train their neural networks to, for example, recognize faces in photos—feeding in millions and millions of pictures—GPUs handle much of the calculation. Some giants like Microsoft are also using alternative silicon to execute their neural networks after training. And even though it’s crazily expensive to custom-build chips, Google has gone so far as to design its own processor for executing neural nets, the tensor processing unit. With its TPUs, Google sacrifices long-term flexibility for speed. It wants to, say, eliminate any delay when recognizing commands spoken into smartphones. The trouble is that if its neural networking models change, Google must build a new chip. But with FPGAs, Microsoft is playing a longer game. Though an FPGA isn’t as fast as Google’s custom build, Microsoft can reprogram the silicon as needs change. The company can reprogram not only for new AI models, but for just about any task. And if one of those designs seems likely to be useful for years to come, Microsoft can always take the FPGA programming and build a dedicated chip. A newer version of the final hardware, V2, a card that slots into the end of each Microsoft server and connects directly to the network. Clayton Cotterell for WIRED Microsoft’s services are so large, and they use so many FPGAs, that they’re shifting the worldwide chip market. The FPGAs come from a company called Altera, and Intel executive vice president Diane Bryant tells me that Microsoft is why Intel acquired Altera last summer—a deal worth $16.7 billion, the largest acquisition in the history of the largest chipmaker on Earth. By 2020, she says, a third of all servers inside all the major cloud computing companies will include FPGAs. It’s a typical tangle of tech acronyms. CPUs. GPUs. TPUs. FPGAs. But it’s the subtext that matters. With cloud computing, companies like Microsoft and Google and Amazon are driving so much of the world’s technology that those alternative chips will drive the wider universe of apps and online services. Lee says that Project Catapult will allow Microsoft to continue expanding the powers of its global supercomputer until the year 2030. After that, he says, the company can move toward quantum computing. Later, when we talk on the phone, Nadella tells me much the same thing. They’re reading from the same Microsoft script, touting a quantum-enabled future of ultrafast computers. Considering how hard it is to build a quantum machine, this seems like a pipe dream. But just a few years ago, so did Project Catapult. Correction: This story originally implied that the Hololens headset was part of Microsoft’s NExT organization. It was not. Go Back to Top.

Whining coils, scratch tests, home buttons inoperable with gloves on, Intel chips inside - the sort of things no keynote prepares you for. Then there was the curious issue of the shuffle button gone missing on iOS 10's Music app (hint: it's not missing, just hiding). And for the anarchists out there - the iPhone7 has already been jailbroken. With the iPhone 7 already out, the focus is gradually shifting towards the next big thing in the industry - the Google Pixel smartphones launch. Officially coming on October 4, the Pixel and Pixel XL should usher in Android 7.1 and come with IP53 certification and revised chipsets. The occasional photograph of the Nexus descendants could also be spotted this week. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced the Nokia 216 feature phone - yes, Microsoft still makes those, but this could very well be the last one. HTC, on the other hand, unveiled the Desire 10 Pro and Desire 10 Lifestyle - same striking looks, different innards (though what's with the Snapdragon 400 in the Lifestyle?). Read the details on these topics below, as well as some other stories from the past week. Google Pixel phones arriving October 4, teaser confirms The company has started sending out invites for the event as well. Google Pixel leaks: new chipset revision, Android 7.1, US version Two separate versions for both the Pixel and Pixel XL were certified.

The RADV Radeon Vulkan Linux Driver Continues Picking Up Features Written by Michael Larabel in Radeon on 25 September 2016 at 04:29 PM EDT. 10 Comments It has been about two weeks since last reporting on "RADV" Radeon Vulkan activities, but development hasn't let up and there has been several feature commits since then on this open-source Vulkan Linux driver for Radeon AMDGPU-interfacing hardware. For those not following David Airlie's "semi-interesting" Mesa branch, some of the highlights since I last talked about it on Phoronix include: - Wayland support for RADV. - There's also Xlib WSI support (windowing system integration). - Some changes for helping to bring-up Southern Islands support on this driver. - Compute shader based resolves. - Enabling HiZ by default. And there has been various other changes and fixes, including porting of some more code over from Intel's "ANV" Vulkan Linux driver. The updated TODO list also gives a better look at the overall RADV state. So far RADV continues making much progress with AMD having not yet open-sourced their Vulkan Linux driver. It's still sounding like AMD might just work towards open-sourcing bits relevant to RADV where this community-originated driver may end up being the long-term default open-source Radeon Vulkan driver. It will be interesting to see when it's integrated into mainline Mesa. I will probably do some fresh RADV vs. AMD Radeon Vulkan benchmarking in a week or two once the Linux 4.9 development kicks off with the merging of the new DRM-Next features. 10 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Civilization 6 to Release Soon, Fans Can Buy the Special Anniversary Edition, AI Leaders to Make the Game Interesting Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: September 26, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» Civilization 6 will launch next month, and 2K Games has released the system requirement for the PC. The fans are busy trying to figure out what improvements need to be made to their PC, in order to support the game. 2K Games thanked the fans for cooperating with them and the developers Firaxis. The game developers had taken a lot of time to ensure that Civilization 6 was optimized. The minimum requirement for the PC is Windows 7 64BIT or 8.1 64BIT or 10 64BIT. The CPU should be Intel Core 13 2.5 GHZ or an AMD PHENOM 11 2.6 GHZ. The PC should have a basic 4 GB RAM with 12 GB hard drive. The system needs a DVD-ROM for the installation disc. A 1 GB DX 11 video card is a must. The basic requirement of the graphics card is either an AMD 5570 or an NVIDIA 450. While these are the minimum requirements of Civilization 6, they aren’t the recommended system requirements. The demands of the Civilization 6 system requirement are very low as compared to games like Mafia III and Battlefield 1. 2K Games along with Firaxis decided to launch the Anniversary Edition of Civilization 6. The special edition is priced at $90. The Anniversary Edition will have limited copies with only 20,000 of these available in the market. The special edition contains the new game along with the content featured in the digital deluxe. The bundle includes the Aztec civilization preorder bonus. The players also receive a special 25th-anniversary coin set and display case. There is also a 100-page Civilization Through the Years hardcover art book. The special edition comes with a special packaging themed around the anniversary celebration. Created by Sid Meier, the game debuted in 1991 and had continued to be highly popular over the years. On the occasion of the 25th anniversary, Meier released a statement saying that he hopes that the players enjoy the world that they have created with the new features. The Aztec civilization pre-order pack will be available for free for everyone three months after Civilization 6 launches on 21st October. The deluxe edition would give the players access to four expansion packs with new maps, scenarios, civilizations, and leaders. The countdown to Civilization 6 has started, and Firaxis decided to provide the players with a glimpse of the different leaders in the game. The latest culture to be brought into the game in Rome with Trajan as the leader. It is interesting to note how Civilization 6 brought in Trajan instead of Caesar and Augustus, to be the ruler of Rome. Trajan was responsible for the greatest military expansion of Rome. With him as the leader, fans are hopeful that Civilization 6 will deal with Rome’s most significant phase of expansion. The other civilizations included in the game include Kongo, Greece, Germany, India and Spain to name a few. The AI in Civilization is what makes it interesting. Firaxis has incorporated AI leaders in Civilization 6, and they help the player understand their strategies and actions better, by talking to them. To make the leaders more distinctive in Civilization 6, the developers have given each AI a hidden agenda. Until the previous installments, the cities in the game have taken only one title irrespective of the number of buildings and wonders. Civilization 6 updated this particular feature. The game split the cities across multiple tiles and different districts. Building the districts involves a lot of strategies. The players have to decide where each district will go and which titles they will reserve for farming. Civilization 6 provides bonus points to the players who place districts close to certain things.

Technology 6 0 0 September 25, 2016 Will The Microsoft Surface Book 2 Really Be Released With The 2016 MacBook Pro This Fall? Daryl Deino There are many rumors going around that Microsoft will releases the Surface Book 2 earlier than expected in order to compete with the new MacBook Pros, which are said to be released in the fourth quarter of 2016. According to a site called University Herald, Microsoft is getting ready to announce the updated Surface Book. “Looks like a good news for gadget freaks as Microsoft is gearing up to launch its next-generation device, the Surface Book 2 during the company’s October event along with the Surface Pro 5. Rumor has it that Microsoft will unveil its new flagship offerings next month.” When will the Surface Book 2 arrive? [Image by Daryl Deino] The beginning of the article, like other similar ones announcing the Surface Book 2, could just be clickbait. After all, the article goes on to state that the Surface Book 2 is more likely to hit the store shelves in Spring 2017, when Redstone 2, the second important update to Windows 10, is released. It also believed that Microsoft will wait for the newly released Kaby Lake processors to be in full supply, which they will be by the beginning of 2017. Besides, after several updates, Microsoft has recently made the first Surface Book a usable device that was marred with many glitches upon its release. When Microsoft first released the Surface Book in October of 2015, CNET gave it four stars. “The Microsoft Surface Book packs high-end components, including new Intel processors and optional Nvidia graphics, into a smart, slim body. Some components and most of the battery are hidden in the base, so the tablet half is lighter. The high-res screen looks great, and the included stylus pen is excellent.” <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XvgfMOOA-kk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> However, CNET, as well as others, noted that there were some first generation bugs, and some buyers said their Surface Book was almost unusable until this past spring. Some of the problems included poor battery life, an unresponsive touchpad, and display driver difficulties. Since the Surface Book was a first generation product, it’s doubtful that the Surface Book 2 will be as problematic upon its release date. According to Vine Report, the next generation Surface Book looks to be a great upgrade. “Microsoft is set to release a new Surface Book, called the Surface Book 2, and it is expected that the device would be delivering improvements on both its hardware and design. In terms of power and specs, it is expected that the upcoming Surface Book 2 laptop/tablet hybrid would be running under the new Intel Kaby Lake series of chipsets.” The article adds that Microsoft will also be ditching the hinge that caused a lot of problems with the first generation device, even though Microsoft had claimed the hinge was necessary to separate the screen from the rest of the notebook. It will be replaced with a more refined Dynamic-Fulcrum hinge. Others say that at least one version of the Surface Book will have a 4K screen and a higher-end version that will be VR-capable. There is certainly a lot of excitement for the Surface Book 2 on Twitter. Would love to see a @surface book 2 with a gtx1060 or better. Crikey I'd want that bad… — Robert Smith (@vijilKiwi) August 29, 2016 I want it, but I also want to wait for the Surface Book 2; and also don't have lots of money. https://t.co/exLmKpQHzX — Josh Fields (@partiallypro) May 3, 2016 Microsoft Surface Book 2 latest news: Laptop rumored to launch in October and released… https://t.co/7Wyqmaydfa pic.twitter.com/j2fWlMH6H2 — Las Vegas NV Blog (@LasVegasNvBlog) September 18, 2016 Microsoft will face a lot of competition from Apple, who is said to be releasing the updated 2016 MacBook Pro soon. Apple hasn’t significantly upgraded the MacBook Pro since 2012, and according to Bloomberg, that is all about to change. “Apple Inc. is preparing the first significant overhaul of its MacBook Pro laptop line in over four years, according to people familiar with the matter, using one of its older products to help reverse two quarters of sliding sales,” says columnist Mark Gurman, who adds that the updated notebooks will be thinner, will include a touch screen strip, and contain more powerful and efficient graphics processors. The 2016 MacBook Pro is scheduled to be released either in October or November. If Microsoft does release the Surface Book 2 at the same time, consumers will have a lot of great options. Which notebook are you looking forward to the most — the Surface Book 2 or the 2016 MacBook Pro? Let us know in the comments section.

Scythe Byakko is a compact cooling solution with a total height of mere 130 millimeters, which fits in virtually every PC case.  Great compatibility is assured thanks to the asymmetric alignment of the base-plate and the heatsink. Byakko is equipped with Scythes Slip Stream 92 PWM fan, offering a wide speed range for different purposes. User friendly and fast mounting of Byakko on both Intel and AMD Sockets is accomplished thanks to the supplied mounting clips. Scythe Byakko was designed with the aim to fit into most PC cases on the market and to offer maximum compatibility to tall memory modules as well as VRM heatsinks. All this is possible thanks to the compact dimensions of 102 x 130 x 84 mm (W x H x D) and the new asymmetric design of the heatsink. Three high-quality copper heatpipes with 6 millimeter diameter are connecting the solid copper base-plate and the aluminum fins-stack heatsink. Both the copper-heatpipes and the copper-baseplate are nickel-plated in the final process, in order to avoid corrosion and to improve the quality. The new heatsink comes with a pre-installed Slip Stream 92 PWM (SY9225SL12M-P) axial-fan, which offers flexible speed range, starting at ultra-silent 300 RPM and going up to 2.300 RPM for best performance. This speed range allows steady airflow from 11,38 to 79,09 m³/h, respectively 6,70 to 46,55 CFM. Byakko is equipped with a simple yet versatile mounting system, allowing secure and fast mounting process on various CPU sockets. The list of compatible CPU Sockets is long and covers all major sockets, such as the Intel Sockets LGA775, LGA1150, LGA1151, LGA1155, LGA1156, LGA1366 as well as the AMD Sockets AM2, AM2+, AM3, AM3+, FM1, FM2 and FM2+. The package includes all required clips for mounting, a user-manual as well as a package of thermal grease. Scythe Byakko with the Model-No. SCBYK-1000 is available as of today on the European market with the MSRP of 20,50 € (VAT/Taxes not included). For more information, visit the product page.

Share story By Seattle Times staff Seattle Times business staff The “Cascadia” brand has been applied to various corners of the Pacific Northwest, for everything from an environmentalist call to action to a soccer championship. Variations of the term, in circulation since the 1970s, have had the region spanning Northern California to Alaska, the narrow stretch around Interstate 5, or the land inside the Columbia River and Salish Sea basins. Former Seattle Mayor Paul Schell long deployed Cascadia for his advocacy of high-speed rail from Portland to British Columbia, and a bid at a cross-border Olympic Games. But rarely has Cascadia been as geographically confined as it was this past week at a gathering aimed at tying the Seattle area closer to Greater Vancouver, B.C.

More than 300 business and government leaders converged on Vancouver on Tuesday for the “Emerging Cascadia Innovation Corridor” conference. Business cards were exchanged, memorandums of understanding were signed, and, later, salmon was served. As one Washington-side government official, scanning the crowd at end of the event, asked: “Where’s Portland?” Not invited, it seems. The Portland Business Alliance and Technology Association of Oregon both say they weren’t aware of the event. Neither was Portland Mayor Charlie Hales, though a spokesman pointed out that Portland’s Timbers of Major League Soccer were currently on top in the annual “Cascadia Cup” clashes with the Seattle Sounders and Vancouver Whitecaps, making Portland the toast of Cascadia by that measure. The reason the Rose City was left out might have something to do with the driving force behind the conference: Microsoft. The company has a sales office in Portland and manufacturing facility in nearby Wilsonville, but Vancouver, and its looser immigration restrictions, is the Northwest city that has held Microsoft’s attention this year. Helped by a B.C.-negotiated exemption to Canada’s temporary-worker program, Microsoft this summer opened a newly expanded Vancouver development outpost, which in part serves as a sort of way station for immigrant developers for a company long critical of what it says are too few guest-worker visas in the U.S. The company’s gleaming new office space, coincidentally located above a retail store owned by Seattle compatriot Nordstrom, has space for 750 workers. (A majority of those currently working there, Microsoft says, are Canadian citizens.) Portland, for all the advantages residents would claim in craft beer or soccer, is governed by the same immigration laws as Microsoft’s Redmond home. Perhaps Intel, Oregon’s largest private-sector employer and the Portland area’s technology anchor, will fire back with its own cross-border conference. — Matt Daymday@seattletimes.com Oracle’s Ellison challenges AWS Larry Ellison, the world’s ninth-wealthiest billionaire, is picking a fight with Jeff Bezos, who is No. 3 on Bloomberg’s list of richest people on the planet. Or at least with the Amazon.com cloud computing unit that helped catapult Bezos to that rank. The Wall Street Journal reported that Ellison, co-founder of enterprise computing behemoth Oracle, threw down the gauntlet at Amazon Web Services last week during the Oracle World conference in San Francisco. AWS is the business that largely dominates the growing field of cloud computing. “Amazon’s lead is over. Amazon is going to have serious competition going forward,” Ellison said, according to the Journal report. “We now have a tech advantage over Amazon in infrastructure service.” In a conference call earlier this month, Ellison touted the Redwood City, Calif., company’s new data centers, which compete directly with Amazon’s, and, according to Ellison, allow Oracle customers to move their entire operations and data from their own corporate servers to the Oracle cloud without making any changes. Amazon, which likes to say it focuses on customers and not competitors, didn’t respond to a request for comment. How likely is Oracle to eat Amazon’s lunch? Amazon, after all, helped usher in the continuing boom in infrastructure-as-services business by making its data centers available to third parties a decade ago, and now has built it into a business that collected $2.9 billion in revenue (and $718 million in operating income) in the quarter ended in June. “It’s a ridiculous claim,” said Justin Moore, CEO of Axcient, a company that specializes in combating data loss in cloud applications. Moore says it took Amazon 10 years to get where it is, half of which were spent finding its feet. “That isn’t something that comes overnight nor with bravado and chest-thumping,” he said. Then again, it might not be impossible to build a hugely profitable cloud franchise, an objective Microsoft, Google and IBM are also after. Many analysts say the mass migration of corporate data from proprietary data centers to those of cloud providers is only beginning, and many companies could meet that demand. Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said as much in a conference call last June. “There’s plenty of room for multiple winners in this business,” he said. —Ángel Gonzálezagonzales@seattletimes.com Theo offers ‘healthful’ bite Seattle-based Theo Chocolate, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, is launching a new line of what it calls “a healthier chocolate-based snacking alternative.” Each serving of the bite-sized Theo Chocolate Clusters contains at least 50 mg of cocoa flavonols, a phytonutrient that some have said is good for cardiovascular health. The clusters are a combination of dark chocolate, crispy quinoa, toasted coconut and cocoa flavonols, and come in three flavors: salted almond, turmeric coconut, and lemon hemp. Packages of clusters sell for $5.99 and are available for purchase online and at Theo’s factory store. The clusters are the latest for the company, which has, over the years, introduced a Fantasy line (including flavors such as coconut curry and bread & chocolate), a Classics line of chocolate bars, a peanut-butter cup and almond-butter-cup line, coconut bites and more.

 Facebook has built a world-class, murderous, Doom-playing AI Rob Price Sep. 24, 2016, 5:09 AM 7,087 facebook linkedin twitter email print Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg.Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Researchers from Facebook have built a highly efficient piece of artificial intelligence (AI), programmed to slaughter anything in its path. Luckily, it can only play "Doom". A team from the social network blasted its way to glory this week in a contest to build programs capable of autonomously playing the classic first-person shooter game. Called VizDoom, it's an irreverent test of skill for AI researchers, focused on eight-player deathmatches. Think your software is smart? Prove it: Defeat your rivals in a bloody eight-player shoot-out. (Engadget's Aaron Soupporis has talked to some of the human teams, and written a deep dive on their strategies and the outcome of the matches.) AI, of wildly varying levels of sophistication, has been in games since the earliest days of the medium. But what sets VizDoom apart is the kind of input the AI competitors are given. Traditionally, computer-controlled entities will be fed a stream of incomprehensible (in human terms) data: Coordinates, shifting variables, internal data (like maps) and so on, which they respond to according to preset rules. In contrast, the VizDoom competitors are only given access to the "screen buffer" — AKA the contents of the computer screen — for it to decide what to do, in the same way human players do. And the competing AI's also "learn" via constant reinforcement, adapting their strategies over time as they figure out what works and what doesn't. In short, it's forced to play exactly as a human does. There were two categories of play in the competition: Facebook's F1 team won the first, and chipmaker Intel's IntelAct team won the second. The one that Facebook won was simpler. It's a deathmatch that takes place on a map that AI competitors have played on and trained on in advance, with only one weapon available — the rocket launcher. Ammo and medkits (health) are scattered around to collect as required. You can watch them battle in the video below. By and large, they're pretty good. But the second is more complex — and makes Intel's achievement especially impressive. It takes place on a map the AI's haven't previously ever seen before, with a variety of mystery weapons and items in. The competitors can't just put their pre-match training into effect — they have to actively learn the map in their battle for supremacy. As you can see in the video below, this is where the competitors' failings become more apparent. PotatoesArePrettyOx (in the top right) struggles to walk in a straight line — when it's not just shooting the wall. On first glance, Intel's and Facebook's achievements seem both impressive, and slightly pointless. But you have to remember that this isn't really about Doom. The teams are stacked with incredibly sophisticated researchers, at the cutting edge of AI development. Just like Google DeepMind's successes playing boardgame Go, VizDoom is an accessible way to demonstrate to the world the nascent possibilities of artificial intelligence tech — and also encourage friendly rivalries between professionals at different companies. But that said, developing AI designed to destroy everything it sees with explosives in the most efficient way possible won't do much to assuage the fears of people worried about the rise of "killer robots."

data centers will be a key driver for market growth. ICT has become the backbone of many government operations across countries. (EMAILWIRE.COM, September 24, 2016 ) Technavio Announces the Publication of its Research Report Global RAID Controller Card Market 2016-2020 Technavio recognizes the following companies as the key players in the global RAID controller card market: Avago Technologies, Intel, Fujitsu, Dell, and HP. Commenting on the report, an analyst from Technavios team said: Increasing popularity of flash-based storage will be a key trend for market growth. SSD storage or flash storage offers greater efficiency than traditional HDD storage devices. In 2015, the cost of flash-based storage was greater than that of HDD-based storage arrays. Vendors are continuously decreasing their product prices due to the increased demand for storage infrastructure in the market. With the increased use of mission-critical applications, flash-based storage arrays offer 40 times better than hard disk input/output (I/O) performance and around 50% reduction in power consumption. Due to the higher cost involved in procuring flash-based storage systems, it will experience a higher growth in large and mega data centers. However, the price of these systems will drop by 5%-10% YoY, resulting in an increased demand for flash storage during the period 2018-2020. The overall market will experience a steady growth in the adoption of flash and traditional storage systems, where flash will add more revenue in the coming years. Browse full report with TOC@ https://marketreportscenter.com/reports/383390/global-raid-controller-card-market-2016-2020 According to the report, increasing number of government data centers will be a key driver for market growth.

Home > News By Company > Market Reports Center Tweet   Baseband Processor Market Growth, Demand, Opportunity, Analysis And Forecasts To 2020 Commenting on the report, an analyst from Technavios team said: Development of next-generation wireless networks will be a key trend for market growth (EMAILWIRE.COM, September 24, 2016 ) Technavio Announces the Publication of its Research Report Global Baseband Processor Market 2016-2020 Technavio recognizes the following companies as the key players in the global baseband processor market: Qualcomm, MediaTek, Intel, Broadcom, and Spreadtrum. Commenting on the report, an analyst from Technavios team said: Development of next-generation wireless networks will be a key trend for market growth. As mobile communication devices are gaining traction, the network traffic is rapidly increasing. This is leading to an increase in the deployment of next-generation wireless networks such as 3G, 4G, and 5G. These technologies offer wireless connection similar to home broadband connections. This, in turn, increases the number of users accessing the internet from anywhere, at any time. Browse full report with TOC@ https://marketreportscenter.com/reports/383374/global-baseband-processor-market-2016-2020 According to the report, at the end of 2013, Chinese government issued 4G licenses to three major telecom operators, namely China Mobile with frequency spectrum of 1880MHz-1900MHz, 2320MHz-2370MHz, and 2575MHz-2635MHz bands; China Telecom with frequency spectrum of 2370MHz-2390MHz and 2635MHz-2655MHz; and China Unicom with frequency spectrum of 2300MHz-2320MHz, marking the beginning of China's high-speed mobile network. The purpose of issuance of a 4G license by the Ministry of Industrial Information Technology (MIIT) is to increase consumer spending on information technology. Also, the launch of 4G is likely to drive the retail sales of smartphones. Hence, many smartphone manufacturers are launching 4G smartphones to grab this opportunity. This has also led to a decline in the prices of 3G smartphones, which in turn, propelled the sales of 3G smartphones in China. This factor will be a key driver for market growth, driving the demand for baseband processors. Further, the report states that one of the major challenges for the existing vendors in the market is that smartphone vendors such as Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, and Samsung are opting for in-house production of baseband processors. The vendors established with high economies of scale have capabilities to vertically integrate the supply chain and are financially strong to invest in new product lines and related R&D. Further, Xiaomi has announced that they will start manufacturing smartphone processors from the second half of 2016. Though this does not affect the global baseband processors market, it affects the established vendors such as Qualcomm and MediaTek, as they are highly dependent on the mobile devices manufacturers. The study was conducted using an objective combination of primary and secondary information including inputs from key participants in the industry. The report contains a comprehensive market and vendor landscape in addition to a SWOT analysis of the key vendors.

Enhancing Virtualization Performance with VMware VStorage –Dell, Inc. Dell Technologies is looking to tap channel partners in the desktop virtualization space to sell two new mobile thin clients. The Dell Latitude E7270 and the Latitude 3460, released this week, are the latest additions to Dell's virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) portfolio, which the company has steadily expanded throughout the year. Designed using Dell's Latitude laptop platforms and Wyse thin clients, the Dell thin clients target two classes of mobile workers within customer organizations: the highly mobile worker, such an employee who is frequently on the road, and 'the corridor warrior,' an employee that's mobile within an  office environment, said Dan O'Farrell, senior director of product marketing for cloud client computing at Dell.

The higher-performing of the two Dell thin clients, the Latitude E7270, is equipped with a 12.5-inch display and an Intel 6th Generation Core i5 processor, which provides the "local horsepower to ensure a great user experience," O'Farrell said. He added the E7220 best suits users "who need a fairly powerful end device for accessing their virtual desktops." The Latitude 3460, by contrast, has a larger, 14-inch screen and an Intel Celeron 3215U processor. He noted it suits an office worker who runs "the everyday mix of Office applications," such as Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint and Word. "We view the channel as key in the go-to-market model for [the new Dell thin clients]," O'Farrell said. "I think the way our partners will look at [the Latitude E7270 and 3460 release] is that it's even more choice and more capability for customers." He added the products are ideal for the five "usual suspect" verticals for thin client sales -- healthcare, retail, education, finance and government. Other relevant verticals include exploration and energy, manufacturing and media editing. While the mobile thin clients are "part and parcel to [Dell's] overall goal to make desktop virtualization easy to plan, easy to purchase, easy to implement and easy to operate," O'Farrell noted that VDI is "still a somewhat complex animal." The complexity presents an opportunity for partners to offer design, planning, education and training services to customers, as well as value-added services to oversee VDI environments. Dell's strategy for simplifying VDI also allows for a faster sales cycle, which gives Dell partners the opportunity to "flip over many, many more deals." "We've done great things to vastly simplify [VDI], but the other advantage to partners is that you can make a VDI opportunity much more transactional in nature," he said. BTG offers hyper-convergence, private clouds to partners Breakthrough Technology Group (BTG), a managed infrastructure, IT and telecom solutions provider, said it has transitioned its private cloud offering to a hyper-converged architecture and plans to ramp up its channel program in 2017. The company's Adaptable Cloud Services are hosted in SSAE 16-certified data centers. In addition, BTG provides offerings layered on top of its hyper-converged infrastructure. According to the company, those include AppsAnyplace, a managed hosted virtual desktop and application delivery offering; SaaSAnyplace, a suite of Microsoft productivity tools provided as a service; and DataAnyplace, a secure collaboration, data management and sharing offering built on Citrix ShareFile. BTG pursues channel ties with consultants, value-added resellers, managed service providers (MSPs) and other channel companies through its Private Cloud Partner Program. Jeff Kaplan, CEO of BTG, based in Morganville, N.J., said channel partners accustomed to supplying on-premises servers and storage could be left out as customers shift to the cloud. He said partners could find themselves "with a big, gaping revenue hole that they need to fill, or [they'll] be in trouble." He said more partners will need to transition to a recurring revenue model, but noted that cloud infrastructure is expensive to build. "Most [channel companies] are going to want to partner with someone," Kaplan said. Other news Users of LabTech's remote monitoring and management software can now integrate it with security capabilities from vendor Trend Micro Inc. The new Trend Micro Worry-Free Services plug-in offers protection against malware, spam, ransomware and other security threats, allowing MSPs to deploy Trend Micro's security services to devices across an entire customer base, as well as perform scans and updates within the LabTech console. Trend Micro MSP partners can access the plug-in through the LabTech Solution Center. A SADA Systems survey of more than 300 healthcare IT professionals in North America found most respondents believe cloud computing is having a positive effect on patient care and satisfaction. The MSP's survey noted 56% of respondents cited cloud-based applications as improving patient satisfaction, while 55% of respondents said such apps contribute to better treatment, according to the company. Improved productivity and efficiency for staff and patients was another plus, with 64% of those polled attributing those benefits to cloud technologies. CompTIA launched a campaign the organization said aims to make the IT industry more gender-inclusive. CompTIA released an e-book and associated website, Make Tech Her Story: What Needs To Change.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Mon, Sep 26, 2016 - Page 14　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp G7 transportation heads back US guidelines AP, TOKYO US Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx, second right, talks with Japanese Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Minister Keiichi Ishii, second left, during a meeting on the sidelines of a G7 meeting in Karuizawa, Japan, on Friday. Photo: AP US Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx yesterday said that his counterparts in the G7 nations welcomed US guidelines on regulating self-driving cars and have agreed to work together on creating such standards to maintain safety. “There was actually a very enthusiastic reception to the policy,” he said. “We did a good job of inventorying what each country is doing and laying out areas that we want to explore further.” Such issues include cybersecurity, ethics and privacy, wireless spectrum questions and many other issues, he said, while noting that reaching a resolution might take years, meaning the technology would be moving faster. Foxx called the US guidelines released earlier this month the most comprehensive on autonomous vehicles, coming out ahead of the rest of the world. He and other transportation officials from the G7 met over the weekend in the Japanese resort town of Karuizawa. Speaking by telephone, Foxx stressed road tests on autonomous vehicles must continue to encourage innovation. US electric car maker Tesla Motors Inc’s Model S that was using the semi-autonomous mode crashed in May. The driver died after crashing into a tractor-trailer. Tesla is introducing improvements to its Autopilot system to make it safer. “One of the things I think that autonomous vehicles suffer from is that they get compared to perfection, and not to the 94 percent of car crashes that are attributable to human factors. We have to make the right comparisons,” Foxx said, while declining comment on the ongoing investigation on Tesla. “These vehicles will not be absolutely perfect in terms of having no accidents, but by comparison they can be markedly better.” Many automakers besides Tesla are testing or have rolled out automated vehicles, including Ford Motor Co, based in Dearborn, Michigan, and Nissan Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp of Japan. The new US guidelines are meant to bring order to the technology’s development. Proponents say such technology can make cars safer because machines can react faster and they are less prone to human error. However, even experts remain cautious. Among the recent forays into self-driving technology are the partnership between Chinese-owned Volvo Cars Corp and the Swedish-based automotive safety group Autoliv Inc, as well as Volvo teaming up with US ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc. Ford has announced a US$75 million investment in Velodyne Inc, which makes laser sensors. BMW Group, Intel Corp and Mobileye NV have joined together to develop and sell autonomous driving technology. Hans Greimel, Asia editor for Automotive News, believes the new US guidelines are an important “proactive” step in seeking powers to approve autonomous vehicles before they’re brought to market, marking a departure from the past, when regulators enforce rules after the cars are already sold. “They are a clear step toward clearing the way for the next-generation of automobiles. The technology of autonomous vehicles is mostly there. What is lacking is a clear guideline for how the technologies should be applied,” Greimel said. This story has been viewed 1220 times.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Apple promises fix for iOS 10’s iTunes backup security flaw Adam Westlake - Sep 25, 2016 2 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Security forensics company Elcomsoft revealed last week that encrypted iOS backups created in iTunes have been made far less secure with the recent release of iOS 10. While an unintentional flaw, the new password protected backups offer an “alternative password verification mechanism” that allows them to fall victim to brute force hacks much more quickly and easily than with previous iOS versions. Fortunately Apple acknowledged the issue, and says a fix is on the way with “an upcoming security update.” To be clear, this is an issue that only applies to local iTunes backups created on a Mac or PC; backups made to iCloud remain secure. As Elcomsoft explains, iOS 10’s backup method “skips certain security checks,” which in turn allows passwords to be attempted “approximately 2,500 times faster” than before when using brute force. A source of the problem seems to be the use of a different algorithm, which only runs password attempt once, as opposed to running each password 10,000 times like with iOS 4 through 9. “At this time, we have an early implementation featuring CPU-only recovery. The new security check is approximately 2,500 times weaker compared to the old one that was used in iOS 9 backups. At this time, we are getting these speeds: iOS 9 (CPU): 2,400 passwords per second (Intel i5) iOS 9 (GPU): 150,000 passwords per second (NVIDIA GTX 1080) iOS 10 (CPU): 6,000,000 passwords per second (Intel i5)” Getting access to a password protected iOS backup is a serious concern, as it’s essentially a copy of all the data from an iPhone, including contact details like phone numbers, emails, addresses, in addition to photos and even other passwords stored in Keychain. Apple has issued a statement noting that it’s aware of the problem with local iTunes backups for iOS 10 and an upcoming security update will resolve the issue. iOS 10.1 and macOS 10.12.1 updates were recently released for developers and beta testers, so hopefully those will include the necessary fixes.

Osipov ('Orlov') killed in Luhansk (Photo by Artem Shevchenko / Facebook) Send via email Killed in Luhansk Col. Osipov previously commanded a paratrooper unit of Russian army in Anapa The Interior Ministry of Ukraine revealed the details on the murdered in Luhansk Russian colonel. As Ministry's speaker Artem Shevchenko wrote on Facebook, Deputy Commander of Kremlin-sponsored ‘2nd Army Corps' of the puppet state ‘Luhansk Peoples Republic' Alexander Osipov  (nicknamed ‘Orlov') previously served as a paratrooper commander in a Russian army unit in Anapa (Krasnodarsk region, Caucasus, Russia).  "Paratrooper, really big bump. He could serve way along in Anapa, now he is dead in separatists showdown in our land. Suicide of the "premier-minister" Tsypkalov – seems to be logical part of the same case," Shevchenko says in his statement. Open sources say, that in the town of Anapa the base of Guards Artillery Regiment №1141 is placed. This unit is a part of 7th Airborne Assault Division of Russian Army. According to Ukrainian volunteers, units of this division took part in Russian invasion to Ukrainian Donbas in 2014 and 2015, in particular - during the battle of Ilovaysk.

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya) TOKYO (AP) - U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said Sunday that his counterparts in the Group of Seven nations welcomed U.S. guidelines on regulating self-driving cars and have agreed to work together on creating such standards to maintain safety. “There was actually a very enthusiastic reception to the policy,” he said. “We did a good job of inventorying what each country is doing and laying out areas that we want to explore further.” Such issues include cybersecurity, ethics and privacy, wireless spectrum questions and many other issues, he said, while noting that reaching a resolution might take years, meaning the technology would be moving faster. Foxx called the U.S. guidelines released earlier this month the most comprehensive on autonomous vehicles, coming out ahead of the rest of the world. Foxx and other transportation officials from the G-7 met over the weekend in the Japanese resort town of Karuizawa. Speaking by telephone with The Associated Press, Foxx stressed road tests on autonomous vehicles must continue to encourage innovation. U.S. electric car-maker Tesla’s Model S that was using the semi-autonomous mode crashed in May. The driver died after crashing into a tractor-trailer. Tesla is introducing improvements to its Autopilot system to make it safer. “One of the things I think that autonomous vehicles suffer from is that they get compared to perfection, and not to the 94 percent of car crashes that are attributable to human factors. We have to make the right comparisons,” Foxx said, while declining to comment on the ongoing investigation on Tesla. “These vehicles will not be absolutely perfect in terms of having no accidents, but by comparison they can be markedly better.” Many automakers besides Tesla are testing or have rolled out automated vehicles, including Ford Motor Co., based in Dearborn, Michigan, and Nissan Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. of Japan. The new U.S. guidelines are meant to bring order to the technology’s development. Proponents say such technology can make cars safer because machines can react faster and they are less prone to human error. But even experts remain cautious. Among the recent forays into self-driving technology are the partnership between Chinese-owned Volvo Cars and the Swedish-based automotive safety group Autoliv Inc., as well as Volvo teaming up with U.S. ride-hailing company Uber. Ford has announced a $75 million investment in Velodyne Inc., which makes laser sensors. BMW Group, Intel Corp. and Mobileye have joined together to develop and sell autonomous driving technology. Hans Greimel, Asia Editor for Automotive News, believes the new U.S. guidelines are an important “proactive” step in seeking powers to approve autonomous vehicles before they’re brought to market, marking a departure from the past, when regulators enforce rules after the cars are already sold. “They are a clear step toward clearing the way for the next generation of automobiles. The technology of autonomous vehicles is mostly there. What is lacking is a clear guideline for how the technologies should be applied,” said Greimel.

However, an iOS 10 security flaw can compromise it. Elcomsoft, a Russian forensics research firm, has discovered a dangerous loophole in iOS 10 which can allow hackers to crack the otherwise password-protected iPhone backups 40 times faster than before. These backups contain your passwords and other authentication data related to your phone as well as the apps. Apple spokeswoman confirmed to Forbes that the iPhone maker acknowledges the issue and is working on a fix. “We’re aware of an issue that affects the encryption strength for backups of devices on iOS 10 when backing up to iTunes on the Mac or PC. We are addressing the issue in an upcoming security update.” The iOS 10’s security flaw might raise concern among iPhone users, considering the history of iCloud hacks which lead to theft of their photos and other private data. Apple acknowledges iOS 10 security flaw that makes it easier to access protected iTunes backups https://t.co/2l8XQV8GVj pic.twitter.com/xn40ofen10 — 9to5Mac  (@9to5mac) September 25, 2016 Security researcher Oleg Afonin elucidated on Elcomsoft’s blog that the attack is specific to password-protected local backups (on the Mac or PC) produced by iOS 10 devices. Apple spokeswoman clarified that the loophole doesn’t affect iCloud. “This does not affect iCloud backups.” The security flaw affects the local backups created using the iOS 10 running iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, and iPhone 5s. These iPhone models are safe as Apple has integrated a special security hardware system called Secure Enclave. Implemented since the iOS 9 on iPhones, the Secure Enclave safeguards the sensitive code that deals with hash keys for encrypting phone data and controls Apple Pay as well as Touch ID. This module is responsible for delaying every incorrect password guessing attempt. That’s why the time increases every time someone feeds an incorrect passcode on an iPhone. The module wipes out all data from the iPhone after 10 failed attempts to guess the password. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLGFriOKz6U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Unfortunately, there is no similar mechanism employed with the iPhone backups created using iTunes on the Mac or PC. Graham Cluley, a veteran security analyst, noted on Graham Cluley Security News that a hacker will have to target the computer to exploit the security flaw on which the iPhone backup was taken, instead of trying to gain control of the iPhone. Usually, the Mac or PCs protect the local iTunes backups by saving the passwords as hash keys in an encrypted file. In iOS 9, Apple added several security checks which need to be cleared to gain access to the local backup on the Mac or PC. But with the iOS 10, Apple has implemented a weaker algorithm for creating hash keys for storing the passwords. That allows hackers or law enforcers to use a sophisticated software for guessing the best match for the password stored in the hash. Afonin explains that this new password verification method in the iOS 10 appears to be 2,500 times weaker than the one in iOS 9. To prove that, he used an Intel Core i5 processor-based system to conduct a brute-force attack of guessing 6 million passwords per second for the iOS 10 backups. The same tool could guess 2,400 passwords per second for the iOS 9 backups. One way to deal with Apple’s iOS security flaw: jump right ahead to iOS 10 https://t.co/9AbJ80wBVI pic.twitter.com/WeSKA6z7oD — Forbes Tech News (@ForbesTech) August 28, 2016 Such alarming rate of guessing passwords by software can turn out to be a nightmare for Apple. Elcomsoft’s CEO Vladimir Katalov told Motherboard that Apple’s security team reached out to his company seeking more details about the security flaw in iOS 10. “Apple is definitely aware they have implemented [the flaw] themselves :)” The iPhone users are recommended to set strong passwords for their Mac or PC to prevent easy unauthorized access. That should be an ideal practice but in this case, it is necessary. In addition to that, the Mac users can utilize the FileVault feature to encrypt and secure all data on your disk, as suggested on Apple Support pages. You are required to enter your login password, and the FileVault will randomly generate a recovery key which is necessary to access the encrypted file. So make sure you save both details carefully, or else you will be locked out from accessing the encrypted data. Katalov believes that a security update for iOS 10 may not be an easy solution to this security flaw. According to him, a holistic approach is required from Apple to overcome this issue. He told Motherboard in an email, “So I guess that not just iOS update is needed, but also iTunes update as well, and probably some changes to the backup format.” So expect Apple to address iOS 10’s security flaw by releasing updates for several software including iOS, iTunes, and its Mac operating systems.

Reuters/Lucy Nicholson New leaks have revealed that the Microsoft Surface Phone will have a fingerprint sensor and an AMOLED display. High-end phones are increasingly sporting the fingerprint sensor and Microsoft too wants to join the bandwagon and increase its market share. The Redmond-based company couldn’t do much with their Lumia series and now they must be extra careful when releasing a smartphone. According to YIBADA, Microsoft has filed a patent for “fingerprint detection with transparent cover” and hence tech experts believe the Microsoft Surface Phone will have the feature. Tech Times confirmed the news. If the said technology is adopted by the company, the Surface Phone will be much thinner compared to other phones due to the absence of a bulky sensor. The WIPO report can be found here. The new scanner is said to provide added security to users as the phones will unlock only when they place their fingers on the display panel. The Microsoft Surface Phone will unlock once the scanner scans the crests of the owner’s finger. The handset will have a sleeker chassis and an AMOLED display panel. Reports further suggest that the Microsoft Surface Phone will be available in two variants, one for the general consumer and the other for the business consumer. The former will have a 5.5-inch screen and the latter a 6-inch screen. The Microsoft Surface Phone will be powered by an Intel Kaby Lake processor for heavy-duty performance. The base model will have a 4GB RAM and 64GB internal storage. The high-end model will feature an 8GB RAM and 512GB internal storage. The Microsoft Surface Phone will run on Windows 10 and will have a 21MP rear and 8MP front camera. Microsoft may release the device early 2017 during its technical event, writes Mobile & Apps. After Lumia failed to deliver, it seems that Microsoft is keeping no stone unturned and will provide only the best of specs to compete with the very best.

But it’s worth taking a look at what we still don’t know.  Were there two breaches? For around two months, a hacker known as Peace has been selling what is advertised as breach data on 200 million Yahoo accounts.  ADVERTISEMENT Peace is one of the most trusted names in the dubious business of selling gigantic databases of user data. Peace is where the dark web goes to buy 360 million accounts from Myspace, 170 million from LinkedIn, or 70 million from Twitter.  In August, Yahoo told Motherboard it was ‘aware’ of the purported sale of its accounts.  When rumors started circulating on Thursday that Yahoo was going to announce that hundreds of millions of accounts had been breached, most people within the security community assumed that had to refer to Peace.  But, though Yahoo has not said it directly, it seems like breach it announced might be unrelated to Peace. Peace claimed his 200 million account list for sale is from around 2012, Yahoo announced a breach of 500 million names from 2014 from an international actor - not a dark web hustler.  It is not beyond the shady world of dark web sales for vendors to sell fake lists. Peace, however, is a particularly well trusted vendor.  Just how many breaches were there? And if Yahoo is right and a nation-state did breach its systems, how does Peace fit in? What does this mean for Verizon’s purchase of Yahoo? The breach comes at an interesting time. Verizon announced a $4.8 billion deal to purchase Yahoo around the time Peace’s sales of Yahoo credentials became widely known. Yahoo has not said whether it found out about the breach before the deal was announced. With a deal that has not been finalized, and reports in the Washington Post that Yahoo only let Verizon know about the legitimacy of the breach two days ago, there’s a very real chance that the price for the sale will plummet with Yahoo stock.  “As law enforcement and regulators examine this incident, they should investigate whether Yahoo may have concealed its knowledge of this breach in order to artificially bolster its valuation in its pending acquisition by Verizon,” said Sen. Richard BlumenthalRichard BlumenthalEffort to allow federal government to discriminate in the name of religion must not prevail Facebook under pressure to stop fake news Overnight Tech: Tech industry's message to Trump | Busy week for Congress | Google, Facebook take heat over fake news MORE (D-Conn.) in his statement about the attack. How does this affect data breach notification laws?  Blumenthal worried about more than Yahoo artificially bolstering its valuation. He also noted “If Yahoo knew about the hack as early as August, and failed to coordinate with law enforcement, taking this long to confirm the breach is a blatant betrayal of their users’ trust. E-mail accounts can be a trove of sensitive personal information.” He was not the only one. Sen. Mark WarnerMark WarnerOvernight Tech: Lawmakers dig into internet security | FCC drops agenda items | Twitter cracks down on alt right | Intel shakeup Shakeup on Senate Intel: Warner becomes top Dem The Hill's 12:30 Report MORE (D-Va..) also said he was “troubled” by the time it took for Yahoo to announce the breach in his written statement. “Action from Congress to create a uniform data breach notification standard so that consumers are notified in a much more timely manner is long overdue, and I urge my colleagues to work together to pass this essential legislation.” Data breach notification laws are currently a mishmash of 47 wildly differing state regulations - Alabama, New Mexico and South Dakota have no notification laws. The industry and consumer groups have advocated for a strong, consistent national plan. There is a chance Yahoo might have spurred Congress into action. What was the point? Yahoo may be the only company for whom a breach of 500 million accounts can be met with such a sense of “so what” – just try a quick Twitter search for “who still uses Yahoo”. Savvy, and even not-so-savvy consumers moved on from Yahoo to Google years ago. But remember this: The head of the CIA used AOL for email until at least last year.  Taking Yahoo at their word that the breach was orchestrated by a state actor, 500 million accounts serve up a vast number of intelligence gathering opportunities, including, inevitably, at least a few people with direct access to information with security consequences.   The point of the attack does not have to be the content of emails – it could easily be email accounts and connections to use for phishing attacks. Newsmakers are prone to open files sent to them by Katie Couric, Yahoo news anchor, in emails referring to past conversations. It does not have to be to siphon information actively used accounts – it could easily be data never deleted from accounts people long forgot about. It does not even need to be about the 500 million accounts. Yahoo is required under various state and international laws to notify users of the breach. It is not required to notify the public about siphoning of intellectual property (as China is believed to have done with Google during a 2010 attack also believed to involve tampering with dissident email accounts) or notify the public about that a foreign actor checked which accounts had been served warrants - and therefore, which agents might be compromised (as a foreign actor did in a 2010 Microsoft breach).  Why didn’t Yahoo have people reset their passwords as soon as they were aware of Peace?  Even Peace is confused why Yahoo waited on changing their passwords after they knew that 200 million credentials might be for sale. He told Motherboard “well [explitive] them… [W]ell better for me they dont do password reset.”  Tags Richard Blumenthal, Mark Warner   Please enable JavaScript to view the featured perspectives by Versa.

By Sean Portnoy for Laptops & Desktops | September 24, 2016 -- 12:19 GMT (05:19 PDT) | Topic: Hardware Chromebooks could be on sale for under $100 during Black Friday 2016. With the rise of online shopping, Black Friday has lost a bit of its luster -- or insanity, depending on your point of view. But despite Amazon extending the shopping holiday to the whole month of November, and Cyber Monday rivaling its brick-and-mortar predecessor, Black Friday deals remain the focal point for the Christmas buying season, complete with the type of speculation usually reserved for NFL and Academy Award predictions. So what do deal prognosticators envision while they wait for the first Black Friday ads to leak? As you might expect, most of the focus is on doorbusters, those limited time, limited quantity mega-sales that draw headlines and frenzied shoppers. What you might notice in the PC realm, however, is that we've nearly reached a floor on what can be charged with laptops and top-tier tablets. For instance, while a site like BestBlackFriday.com can predict no-name Android tablets could cost as little as 5 bucks, you still won't see an aging iPad mini 2 for less than $149. Of course, the stinginess of discounts on Apple products has only increased over the years -- the company's stores don't even bother to have Black Friday specials anymore after giving out iTunes cards instead of discounts for the previous couple of years -- and that hasn't been helped by the trend of offering store gift cards in lieu of dropping the everyday price. Still, it seems like the iPad Air 2 -- now its "mid-sized" tablet model between the mini and the iPad Pro -- is the most likely to see its price slashed, according to DealNews. In fact, BestBlackFriday expects that you might be able to find it for $299 this Black Friday, or $50 less than its best price last year. What's Hot on ZDNet When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office? GE Digital builds up its global presence with acquisitions, partnerships ​Domino's claims world-first pizza drone delivery Microsoft delivers test builds of Visual Studio for Mac, Visual Studio 2017 for Windows Also expected is a repeat of Amazon offering its cheapest Fire tablet for chump change, possibly even cheaper than the $33.33 it sold it for during the company's Prime Day in July. Deal sites predict an approximate 20%-25% discounts on tablets in general, with even larger deals on older tablets that remain unsold as the market for the device has dipped. Those tablets might look especially enticing when retailers list their original price to boost the supposed discount (a staple of Black Friday pricing trickery), so make sure to see what the tablet has been actually selling for before getting too excited. Last year, $95 Chromebooks set the pace for the lowest-priced laptops of Black Friday, Deal pundits expect the $90 Chromebook doorbuster trend to continue this year. Obviously you'll get one with the lowest specs possible (2GB of RAM, 16GB of built-in storage, non-Intel processor), but Google's intent with the Chromebook design was to minimize the need for a laptop with powerful components, so that might not be a deal-breaker for buyers. For the last couple of Black Fridays, the expectation has been that Windows notebooks would break the $100 barrier, after Microsoft decided it should lower the price of some licenses of the operating system to compete with tablets and Chromebooks. That hasn't really happened -- though refurbished minimally spec'd smaller-sized two-in-ones could be an exception -- and predictions are more reasonably set for $150 laptops for this Black Friday. Though desktops have fallen out of fashion enough that they don't even warrant much speculation, you can expect similar pricing for the lowest cost mini-PCs. If you're looking for a system with a little more heft spec-wise, however, prognosticators say you're more likely to get a better deal on Cyber Monday, since the prices on those models won't be as eye-poppingly low. Just be careful that the retailers are not stating the original price as "market value," which tends to be higher than what it was selling for in the weeks before Black Friday and is bumped up to increase the discount percentage. (Dell did this last year, for example.) And, again, don't look to Apple itself if you want a new MacBook or iMac on sale for Black Friday--you'll have better luck at retailers like Best Buy, B&H, Frys, and MacMall, where a MacBook Air could cost as little as $700 and an iMac for $950. We could be less than a month away from the first major Black Friday ad to leak (as this handy chart of past ads leak suggests), with big guns like Best Buy and Walmart seeing their ads pop up online a couple of weeks before the shopping date (November 25).

Current Mac computers feature graphics chips from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Nvidia, which is the leading manufacturer of high-end graphics chips used in gaming machines, hasn’t been an option for multiple generations of computer models from Cupertino, California-based Apple. Nvidia, in a job ad for a software engineer, said a successful applicant will “help produce the next revolutionary Apple products.” The role would require “working in partnership with Apple” and writing code that will “define and shape the future”’ of graphics-related software on Macs.

All three job listings for the Santa Clara, California-based company cite software development for the Mac, while one specifies an Nvidia Mac graphics driver team, pointing to the potential of Nvidia chipsets returning to the Apple computers. Nvidia and Apple both declined to comment. Graphics chips from Nvidia and Sunnyvale, California-based AMD are increasingly important as computer users take on tasks, like 3D graphics editing, that need faster processing. Virtual reality, which requires the highest-level of graphics processing, and artificial intelligence workloads, such as computer vision and voice recognition, can also benefit from the latest chips. Most Apple machines rely on lower-power graphics that are integrated into the processor from Intel Corp. Graphics chips, which supply more performance, are usually available as optional extras in Apple computers. A return to orders from Apple would help cement Nvidia’s leadership in graphics. While Nvidia still dominates in market share, new chips from AMD have been winning orders from some computer makers. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

View Latest Posts >>> NEO – Is the Syrian Ceasefire a Dead Man Walking? By Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor on September 23, 2016 Is the Syrian Ceasefire a Dead Man Walking? “Never attempt to win by force what can be won by deception.” ― Niccolò Machiavelli by  Jim W. Dean, VT Editor   … with New Eastern Outlook, Moscow Dead Man Walking – the movie [ Note: I would like to thank NEO for getting this piece up quickly, as war material can become old news fast on a moving target like a ceasefire, where evening news can look like a different conflict than reports from the morning. There is enough evidence to support anyone being fatalistic about ever seeing the warring sides in Syria stop fighting as long as the ammo and supplies keep flowing in. That is why I used the “Dead Man Walking” symbolism, as it seems that Syria has been sentenced to death by its Western and Gulf State tormentors, and praying for a reprieve before the end. We saw some very shady blame-game maneuverings going on during the first week, and shameful reporting from the West, almost like reading Pravda from the old Soviet days. The secret ceasefire agreement triggered a battlefield all on its own. The term “state-sponsored terrorism” is never used to describe the foreign backers of the many opposition groups, some who change names more often than their underwear. Even Mr. Ban ki-Moon will never touch the term with a ten foot pole. That failure is what is giving legitimacy to those countries using proxy terrorists. Why should they stop, when they don’t see serious efforts to make them do so, or even discussions? I fear that this could get worse before it gets better … JD ] ____________ – First published  …  September  23, 2016 – The Syrian ceasefire exists in name only, after the Kerry-Lavrov UN side meeting when they stated they would carry forward even after fighting resumed. But realistically, how can they do that when the ceasefire itself has become a war of words, charges and counter-charges, deceptions and half-truths? On death row, when a condemned man is walking to his execution, “Dead man walking” is called down the cell block so those next in line can give their last salute to one about to meet his end, along with any illusions of a last minute reprieve. This will go down as one of the hardest to negotiate ceasefires; and we can see it began unraveling before the ink was dry. The US opposition racked up 300 violations, and used the week to rest and restock to begin a new offensive on southwestern Aleppo. That attack was defeated by the Syrian coalition which had expected it. At the talks, a key ingredient of ceasefire credibility was missing, as there were no enforcement mechanisms in the agreement. There were no consequences whatsoever to rein in the rogue elements caught violating the ceasefire, and for whom obeying the rules does not seem to be a lifelong aspiration. US Syrian Envoy Michael Ratney and Gen Martin E. Dempsey, US chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 2014 I wrote here on NEO on September 13th , Has the Syrian War Finally Reached the Tipping Point?, that US Syrian envoy Michael Ratney was tasked to poll the US-supported opposition groups to get their formal acceptance of the ceasefire and to warn them of “dire consequences” if they did not disengage with the al-Nusra forces that were still on the target list. We know now there were none. His statement was a PR stunt. The opposition groups decided just go ahead and sign onto the ceasefire so the US would have its list to submit to the Russians, and then they did whatever they wanted. We saw this quickly when, in the first few days, the opposition continued to violate the ceasefire, but Kerry and the Western media generally ignored it. The Western Press played its usual sordid role by ignoring the details of large violations by the opposition, while giving front page coverage to anti-Damascus news, despite the Syrian Air Force standing down for the week on attacks against the ceasefire-approved opposition forces. The Russians had gone to great lengths to publish that they have deployed their ability to monitor the ceasefire quite extensively, perhaps hoping to discourage violations. But when these violate reports were treated as nothing by the US coalition, then the violations increased. The rebel groups read between the lines that they could use the ceasefire to their advantage, and they did. We next saw Lavrov asking for the ceasefire agreements to be made public, so the public could see which side was the major violator. The US ignored that request, as it seems there was an agreement that it could not be disclosed without both parties agreeing, and the US has taken advantage of that. As the rebel violations continued to increase throughout the week, it became obvious that the US either had no control over getting compliance from the opposition groups, or was playing make believe in actually trying to, or the Gulf State backers had made an end run around the US and other groups that it has funded to wreck the ceasefire. I mentioned in my NEO article on the 13th that this was a possibility. The Ceasefire goes out with a bang This truck shows no munitions damage at all, but looks like it was hurriedly, but lightly burned. The tires were just singed. The US’ casual attitude toward the ceasefire violations increased the anger of the Russians, who then began to accuse the US of breaking the agreement that the Russians would guarantee Damascus’ compliance and the US would guarantee the opposition’s. After this, things got much worse. We had the irresponsible US coalition attack on the Syrians at the Deir Ezzor airport, followed immediately by an ISIL offensive against the Syrians. This was followed by a weak admission of its being a mistake, and then the revelation that, out of the four planes involved, Australia and Norway had been involved. This appeared to Cold War veterans like the US allies wanted to get some of their pilots “blooded” with a strike from Iraqi bases. So far, we have heard nothing from the Iraqis about their bases being used for the strike. We have to ask why the US would run such an operation during the first delicate and critical week of the ceasefire, when the agreement allowed for joint strikes to begin the second week. Veterans Today analysts do not believe the Deir Ezzor strike was a mistake but payback to the Syrians and Russians for being too public about the US side doing all of the ceasefire violations and the Russian requests to have the agreements made public. All US coalition bombs are GPS guided, and the Syrians have been at the Deir Ezzor airport position for a long time now. There is no way the US coalition could not have known exactly where they were. This the strong smell of an act of war provocation to cause the Syrian coalition to break the ceasefire themselves in retaliation, so the US would put that blame on them, but they did not bite. For even a general artillery attack on a spread out convoy, we would expect to see at least some craters in the roadway. There are none. As the ceasefire closed in on its last day, it now seems that the US decided it needed a psychological operation to counter any bad press of the past few days. It knew the Syrians had picked up on opposition plans to launch a new offensive against Aleppo, and the Syrian and Russian Airforce would do an airborne counterattack, which they did. So, like a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat, we had the night attack on an aid convoy on SW Aleppo, just as the opposition launched its new attack on that flank. We wake up in the morning to find a well-coordinated media campaign alleging Syrian coalition responsibility. We right away saw this at VT as a ploy to move the press coverage off the US and opposition responsibility for the ceasefire failure. But so far they have failed. Even the UN has retracted its early charges of a bombing attack as a translation mistake. But even that was a sham, because the Syrian Air Force has never flow night operations, not having the required equipment in their planes to do so. Although the US State Department instantly condemned the night bombing, it had to know better from its extensive battlefield surveillance. General Igor Konashenkov Major-General Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, stated that it tracked a Predator drone from the Incirlik Air base in Turkey that flew to the convoy location that night, arriving just before the claimed attack. The general third party consensus now is that the convoy was probably shelled, as it was a static target; and which the opposition in that territory easily could have done as a false flag operation, of the kind so typically used in this Syrian war. John Kerry had the gall at the UN Security Council Meeting on the aid convoy event to demand that Russia take responsibility for it and ground the Syrian Air Force to “restore credibility to the process”. But once again we see the US refusing to accept any responsibility for its proxies’ violations, playing the “do as I say, not as I do” game. But mind you, the US has put no drone or satellite Intel on the table to prove that the convoy was bombed. Lavrov has countered by calling for an independent investigation, when Kerry does not want one at all. Lavrov also stated that the Syrian government forces would not unilaterally stop fighting, since their having done so during the ceasefire week was exploited, with the US bombing the Syrian Army in Deir Ezzor. We could possibly see an escalation in the conflict. The Russians are bringing in their flagship aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov, to boost their Mediterranean fleet firepower. Everyone seems to have forgotten about the published news two weeks ago on the Iranian Hamadan Air Base being refitted to host the return of the Russian heavy bombers to repeat their shorter range sorties to Syria from there…if needed. Hamadan Air Base, north of the city And last, we have the offensive on Mosul on schedule for early October, where US-supporting air assets will be busy concentrating on that key battle. We could possibly see Russian bombers flying overhead on their way back and forth between Hamadan and Syria. Would the Russian Hamadan-based planes run support missions against Mosul if requested by the Iraqi government? Nobody knows at the moment, but I can clearly see the preparation for an escalated conflict being put in place, where another “payback” like we saw in Deir Ezzor could take the Syrian war into a new realm. There are those who would love to see that, and I think we all know who they are. Jim W.

Edward Longshanks  September 24, 2016 at 3:53 pm Mr. Lavrow demands the evidence of shell impacts in the case of the convoy attacks. The demand is a little bit tricky, because it will be not so diffcult to get used Russian shells. Log in to Reply lastugro  September 24, 2016 at 6:30 pm Edward Longshanks: the location is too far from the front lines for hostile artillery to reach there. If it was no air attack, it was a ground based bombing from the proximity of the parked trucks. Edward Longshanks  September 25, 2016 at 7:11 am I know, thanks to Southfront. Dr. Abu-Bakr Susta  September 24, 2016 at 10:56 am Very good analysis, Jim. Interesting to see the Russians laying low on fixing responsibility for the aid convoy attack. The Russians & Syrians know what happened and who did it — with evidence soon to show that U.S.-backed moderate head choppers aided in a false flag attack to shift focus away from the U.S. bombing on the known-to-U.S. positions of Syrian troops at Deir Ezzor. The Syria/Russia-led coalition still has the upper hand. The U.S.-Russia deal on Syria was a gift to Obama, on which Bush/NeoCons in U.S. mil/intel and some GCC nations could not allow consummation. Kerry is now frantically trying to salvage the ceasefire and the U.S.-Russia deals on Syria, because working with Russia is the only way for ObamaCo. to salvage any credibility whatsoever on Syria. Log in to Reply Edward Longshanks  September 24, 2016 at 5:41 am The Western strategy is taken from Orwell’s book 1984. It promotes the permanent, ongoing and never ending war, which is needed to convince to own voter at home. This is difficult to understand for the Russian diplomats who think with common sense, that a war with a none-decisive result would bring people to deal together in table talks. Simply written: Insanity against Ratio. The Russian strategy to lead the warfare into a stalemate failed. And it will take time, that Russia is able to establish better and more successful tactics.
