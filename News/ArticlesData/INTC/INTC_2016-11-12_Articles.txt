Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 13, 2016 at 5:00PM For several years now, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been more actively building processor and platform technologies targeted at the very low-end of the personal computer market. These products are based on the company's low-power Atom architectures, rather than its higher-end Core processor architectures. Intel's Client Computing Group chief, Navin Shenoy, holding a processor. Image source: Intel.  At the company's 2015 investor meeting, now-former Intel personal computer chief Kirk Skaugen told investors that between 2010 and 2015, Intel gained approximately 10 percentage points of personal computer processor market share. A lot of that, the executive indicated, was due to Intel's renewed push in the low-end of the market. Intel now seems to be aiming to release new products for this market on an annual cadence to continue to bring new features and technologies to lower, high-volume personal computer price points. The product line that Intel currently offers for this market is called Apollo Lake. In late 2017, Intel is expected to launch a product for this market called Gemini Lake. Thanks to Michael Larabel with website Phoronix, we now have some preliminary information about Gemini Lake. This looks like an "optimization" of Apollo Lake Gemini Lake is going to be the third low-cost Atom-based personal computer processor family built in Intel's 14-nanometer technology, following Braswell and Apollo Lake. Braswell included a mildly enhanced version of the Silvermont processor core found inside the prior-generation Bay Trail product -- manufactured in a 22-nanometer technology -- along with a larger, more powerful graphics engine. Apollo Lake brought significant improvements to both the graphics processing engine as well as the main processor relative to Braswell. Gemini Lake shares much with the prior-generation Apollo Lake, according to Larabel. The fundamental graphics architecture of Apollo Lake, Larabel says, is the same "gen9lp" technology -- that is, low-power Intel ninth-generation graphics -- used in Apollo Lake. Although the full specifications of the chip haven't been made public, this information probably points to Gemini Lake as an "optimization" of the prior-generation Apollo Lake. What that would mean is that the processor core and graphics architecture will remain largely unchanged, with perhaps some very mild changes elsewhere in the chip. The main performance improvement is likely to come from Intel's using an updated, higher-performance variant of its 14-nanometer technology, known as 14-nanometer+. This should allow Intel to boost the CPU and graphics frequencies without raising power consumption, delivering better performance. 10-nanometer Atom in late 2018? It's likely that Gemini Lake will be the last Atom-based personal-computer processor family built in some derivative of Intel's 14-nanometer manufacturing technology. The next part, according to this code from InstLatx64, is known as Mercury Lake and will probably be manufactured in Intel's 10-nanometer technology. If Intel sticks to an annual product release cadence, then we should expect to see Mercury Lake arrive in the fourth quarter of 2018. Intel will have been in production on 10-nanometer technology for about a year at that point, so one can only hope that the technology will be mature enough, and therefore cost-effective enough, to support high-volume production of a chip design targeted at low-cost personal computers. The key for Intel is to make sure to not let up on improving product features and performance in this segment of the market; if low-cost computers fall significantly short of premium smartphones in these areas, then potential buyers of these computers might simply decide to move even more of their daily computing tasks to those phones. That would hurt demand for personal computers and ultimately hurt Intel. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

By Matthew DeCarlo on Nov 13, 2016, 12:00 PM TechSpot The GTX 1080 Ti may have 10GB of VRAM Nvidia's GTX Titan class GPUs always come with huge price tags and the Pascal GTX Titan X is no different, costing $1200 in the US. GTX Titan series GPUs have never been about value for money, but they have always resulted in lower end GTX variants like the GTX 780Ti or GTX 980Ti that provide gamers with relatively good value for money. Ever since the GTX Titan X launched the big question on consumers lips was "where is the GTX 1080Ti", knowing that a more affordable variant is in the works. Now, a Nvidia GPU that is thought to be the GTX 1080 Ti has been found in an Indian shipping manifest... OC3D Intel may add Wi-Fi, USB 3.1 to next-generation chipsets Motherboard chipsets haven’t really changed much in the last few years. There’s been some support for new storage options and standards, like M.2 for SSDs, some limited support for features like Thunderbolt, and faster memory speeds have trickled out over time. Intel might shake things up a bit for its 300-series chipsets in 2017, if rumors are to be believed, with integrated support for Wi-Fi and USB 3.1. ExtremeTech OAuth 2.0 hack exposes 1 billion mobile apps to account hijacking Third-party applications that allow single sign-on via Facebook and Google and support the OAuth 2.0 protocol, are exposed to account hijacking. Three Chinese University of Hong Kong researchers presented at Black Hat EU last week a paper called "Signing into One Billion Mobile LApp Accounts Effortlessly with OAuth 2.0." The paper describes an attack that takes advantage of poor OAuth 2.0 implementations and puts more than one billion apps in jeopardy. Threatpost Customer sues Charter, Time Warner Cable over "Broadcast TV" fees; doesn’t seek monetary damages Last month, Comcast customers accused the cable company of illegally using its "Broadcast TV" and "Regional Sports" fees to raise customers' bills by as much as $10/month. Now a customer of the recently merged Time Warner Cable and Charter Communications is accusing the providers of breaking the law by using similar fees to hide rate hikes while implying to subscribers that these surcharges are required by the government.

Facebook Google Pixel pwned in 60 seconds Power of Community The Google Pixel fell to a team of Chinese hackers alongside Apple Safari and Adobe Flash at the PwnFest hacking competition in Seoul on Friday. Mountain View's latest offering was smashed by white-hat friendlies from Qihoo 360, who used an undisclosed vulnerability to gain remote code execution for $120,000 cash prize. The exploit launched the Google Play store before opening Chrome and displaying a web page reading "Pwned By 360 Alpha Team". The Register Quick, how might the alien spacecraft work? "It's an interesting script," said someone on our PR team. It's pretty common for us to get requests from movie makers about showing our graphics or posters or books in movies. But the request this time was different: could we urgently help make realistic screen displays for a big Hollywood science fiction movie that was just about to start shooting? Backchannel Arduworm: A malware for your Arduino Yun We’ve been waiting for this one. A worm was written for the Internet-connected Arduino Yun that gets in through a memory corruption exploit in the ATmega32u4 that’s used as the serial bridge. The paper (as PDF) is a bit technical, but if you’re interested, it’s a great read. (Edit: The link went dead. Here is our local copy.) Hackaday New record! Robot solves rubik's cube in less than a second Solving a Rubik's Cube is an impressive feat by itself, but now, a robot can do it in record time, cracking the 3D puzzle about 10 times faster than the human who holds the world record. In just over half of a second (0.637 seconds), the Sub1 Reloaded robot made each side of the Rubik's Cube show a single color. This breaks the previous record of 0.887 seconds achieved by an earlier version of the same machine using a different processor. Live Science Apple said to release curved, bezel-free 5-inch and 5.8-inch iPhones next year Apple will release new 5-inch and 5.8-inch iPhones with curved, bezel-free designs next year, according to Barclays Research analysts Blayne Curtis, Christopher Hemmelgarn, Thomas O'Malley, and Jerry Zhang. The analysts, citing sources within Apple's supply chain following a trip to Asia this week, said the borderless design will allow for the new iPhones to be the same overall size as current 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models. MacRumors DIY coprocessors for the Game Boy Color Back in the olden days, when video games still came on cartridges, the engineers and programmers making these carts had a lot of options. One of the most inventive, brilliant, and interesting cartridges to come out of the 90s was Star Fox for the Super Nintendo. Star Fox featured a coprocessor chip, the Super FX, that was effectively a GPU used to draw polygons in the frame buffer. Hackaday Video games are boring Video games are bigger than movies. Everyone's a gamer. I've devoted my life-no exaggeration-to video games for 14 years, working on titles such as Company of Heroes, a few Assassin's Creeds, and Child of Light. But everywhere I go, I meet people who don't like video games. Most of my friends don't like video games. And one of my favourite things when I'm meeting a new person is to watch them squirm, to struggle to relate, after I mention I work in the video game industry. Games Industry Artificial-intelligence system surfs web to improve its performance Of the vast wealth of information unlocked by the Internet, most is plain text. The data necessary to answer myriad questions -- about, say, the correlations between the industrial use of certain chemicals and incidents of disease, or between patterns of news coverage and voter-poll results — may all be online. But extracting it from plain text and organizing it for quantitative analysis may be prohibitively time consuming. MIT LipNet: How easy do you think lipreading is? Lipreading is the task of decoding text from the movement of a speaker's mouth. Traditional approaches separated the problem into two stages: designing or learning visual features, and prediction. More recent deep lipreading approaches are end-to-end trainable (Wand et al., 2016; Chung & Zisserman, 2016a). All existing works, however, perform only word classification, not sentence-level sequence prediction. Yannis Assael Reasons not to use Uber We should not accept the promotional term "sharing economy" for companies like Uber. That is spin. A more accurate term is "piecework subcontractor economy". Because I reject technology that mistreats me, I will never order or pay for an Uber car. I hope there will always be taxis I can use. But what about you?

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 13, 2016 at 11:06AM In each of the past three Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone product cycles, there's been some sort of controversy around the new devices. Image source: Apple.  The iPhone 6 Plus was controversial because the devices were prone to bending under a significant amount of pressure -- a situation critics referred to as "bend gate." The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus didn't suffer from bend gate, but it turned out that Apple dual-sourced the manufacturing of the A9 processors inside these phones. One A9 manufacturer built more efficient chips than the other, and thus the "chip gate" controversy ensued. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus didn't suffer from bend gate, nor did they suffer from chip gate, since the A10 Fusion chip is sole-sourced this time around. However, a new controversy has arisen: modem gate. This year, Apple decided to source modems from two vendors -- Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) -- and, unsurprisingly, a third-party report demonstrated that the Qualcomm modem is superior to the Intel modem. Should Apple investors worry about modem gate? I don't think so -- here's why. Does the modem matter to most consumers? It's very unlikely that most smartphone owners are aware of the modem chips that power their smartphones. Buyers might have a general sense of the wireless capabilities of their phones -- LTE support, for example. The savvier smartphone shoppers may know that if they want to have the flexibility to change carriers, they should make sure to buy unlocked phones with support for the CDMA wireless standard some major networks require. However, it's reasonable to assume that most buyers simply don't factor in the performance or features of the modem much, if at all, in making their purchasing decisions. Indeed, I'd be shocked if most consumers even knew that Apple is dual-sourcing the modems for the iPhone 7-series smartphones. Factors such as form factor, camera, operating system, display quality, and storage capacity are probably much more important to the user experience and buying decisions than the modem is -- assuming, of course, that the modem used is good enough. Qualcomm for the modem aficionados For potential iPhone customers who care about getting iPhone models with the superior Qualcomm modems, there's a very easy solution: Buy an unlocked iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus. The unlocked versions of these iPhones necessarily include Qualcomm modems, as the Intel modems don't support CDMA networks and thus wouldn't work on some major carriers. If a customer is knowledgeable enough to know the differences in modem performance of the Qualcomm-based iPhone and the Intel-based one -- something that wasn't explored in most, if not all, of the mainstream reviews of the devices -- then that customer should have no problem identifying and purchasing the "right" model. Much ado about nothing There's no evidence to suggest that bend gate had any significant impact on iPhone 6 and 6 Plus sales, as the iPhone 6-series sold in record numbers. Nor is there any evidence to suggest that chip gate was influential, either, especially since the A9 chip, no matter the manufacturer, was easily the fastest smartphone processor on the market during its lifetime. Modem gate is more of the same. It's fun for the tech press to write about, and for those who are into the technical stuff, it's interesting. But Apple's iPhone sales are primarily to the non-technical masses who simply want excellent devices. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models with the Qualcomm modems are clearly better, and I would recommend those to individuals looking to buy either phone, but I just can't see any meaningful impact to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus demand based on modem gate. I can't wait to see what next year's "gate" will be.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple and Qualcomm.

The Santa Clara chip maker is readying several unlocked processors based on Kaby Lake, and the overclockable parts aren't just limited to the high end SKUs, either—budget buyers are welcome to come along for the ride, too. We've already seen leaks of unlocked Core i7 and Core i5 processors wading in Kaby Lake. However, the latest leak suggests that Intel will target cost conscious system builders with at least one unlocked Core i3 series processor, that being the Core i3-7350K. A leaked price list shows the retail box version going for $177. If that stands, street pricing could end up being anywhere from $150 to $180, depending on sale pricing and promotions. The Core i3-7350K will be a dual-core processor with Hyper Threading support. It will run fast out of the gate with a base clockspeed of 4GHz and a boost frequency of 4.2GHz, so it will be interesting to see how much overclocking headroom actually exists. We have to imagine there will be at least a few hundred MHz attainable on air cooling, especially if ends up with a TDP rating of 61W as expected. It also has 4MB of L3 cache. Kaby Lake is Intel's 7th generation Core processor architecture. It's built on a 14nm FinFET manufacturing process and is the first architecture to disrupt Intel's traditional tick-tock release cadence. The reason for its release is because getting down to 10nm has proven a bit more difficult than Intel expected, prompting the company to delay Cannonlake until late next year. Kaby Lake fills the gap as a second consecutive tock following Skylake. Having a second consecutive tock isn't all that exciting to enthusiasts, hence a possible reason why Intel is going after the overclocking crowd. The Core i3-7350K is a sub-$200 part that could open up overclocking to a wider audience because of its price and default clockspeeds.

By Feliciano Rodriguez III Posted on November 12, 2016 Share Tweet Share Share Email Get ready for another Macbook Pro 2016 alternative. This time we do a smackdown between age old rivals Apple and Microsoft. In this article, we’ll compare the new and much criticized 13-inch Macbook Pro with the Surface Book. Both of the laptops are targeted at the professional users. How will they compare with each other? Which of them is the more Pro laptop? Let’s find out.

Again, comparing the new 13-inch Macbook to its Windows competitors expose the glaring outdatedness of its 6th Generation Skylake processors. Tech commentators and Apple fans can’t comprehend why Apple chose to use a one generation old processor for its 2016 Macbook Pros. The Surface Book’s 6th Generation Skylake processor is still quick and battery efficient, even one year after its release. The Surface Book can still duke it out against newer Windows laptops like the updated Dell XPS 13, which now has the newer Intel Kaby Lake processors. Both Laptops feature a generous 8GB RAM and both have gorgeous high definition displays. Check out Microsoft’s official website for a more in-depth look the Surface Book. The Surface Book has more input output options though, compared to the Macbook Pros paltry two USB type C ports. Both laptops weigh in at around 1.4kgs, and both have great build quality. The Macbook Pro has Apple’s trademark aluminum unibody design and the Surface Book is made of two magnesium blocks. The two devices look and feel premium. The Surface Book is about $200 more expensive than the base 13-inch Macbook Pro, however, the Surface Book has a touchscreen display, and is compatible with Microsoft’s excellent proprietary Surface Pen. The Surface Book also has a unique hinge wherein the display can disconnect, transforming the Surface Book into a stand alone full tablet. The Macbook Pro cannot trump this unique feature; It doesn’t even have touch screen. Conclusion If you are fully committed or invested in the macOS ecosystem, then you have no choice but to buy the new 13-inch Macbook Pro, or wait for its more advanced brothers with the much touted OLED Touch Bars. However, if you want a unique laptop with great specs, that also transforms into a tablet, then you can’t go wrong with Microsoft’s Surface Book laptop.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 12, 2016 at 8:05AM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been immensely successful in the market for chips that power major data centers. It has managed to protect its nearly total dominance of the enterprise and cloud server processor markets while growing its share in areas such as networking, storage, and high-performance computing accelerators. Intel data-center chief Diane Bryant at the company's annual developer forum. Image source: Intel.  Further, with its purchase of Altera last year, Intel further broadened its portfolio of data-center technologies to include FPGAs. Such chips are increasingly being used to accelerate certain data-center workloads; Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), for example, uses them to accelerate Bing searches. Intel has built a phenomenal portfolio of technologies to support its excellent processors in the data center. However, there is a risk to this business looming on the horizon that the company needs to be ready to respond to with a relatively early launch of server processors built on its 10-nanometer technology. The competition is moving to foundry 7-nanometer tech Intel's main rival in logic chip manufacturing is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM). TSMC's executives have been very vocal about how makers of "high-performance computing" chips are adopting its upcoming 7-nanometer technology. The use cases that TSMC cites here are  "GPU, gaming, PC and tablet, virtual reality, server, FPGA, automotive, and networking applications." TSMC also says these customers "all have aggressive product tape-out plans, starting from [the] early second quarter" of 2017. Based on this, it would be reasonable to expect that at least one of Intel's server processor competitors will bring a product to market manufactured in TSMC's 7-nanometer technology by the end of 2018. Intel's 10-nanometer should be comparable to TSMC 7-nanometer In terms of chip area, I expect Intel's 10-nanometer technology to offer roughly the same density as TSMC's 7-nanometer technology, based on public statements from both companies. Density is important in the server market, since denser manufacturing technologies allow chipmakers to cram more cores and features into a given chip than would have been possible on a coarser technology. The power efficiency benefits that come in moving from one technology to a newer one also help, as power efficiency is a key consideration for server chip buyers. This means that to ensure it doesn't fall behind in terms of server and data-center chip manufacturing technology, and thus product competitiveness, Intel is going to need to get server processors based on its 10-nanometer technology out into the marketplace as quickly as possible. Intel's second-generation 14-nanometer server processor families, known as Skylake-EP/EN/EX, are expected to arrive in the first half of 2017. DigiTimes recently claimed they'll arrive in the first quarter. Ideally, Intel should release Cannon Lake-EP/EN/EX, the 10-nanometer follow-on products to those processors, about a year later, in the first quarter of 2018. Such a timeline would very ne aggressive, though, in light of the time it took Intel to transition from one manufacturing technology to the next over the past few generations.  Process Tech 32-Nanometer 22-Nanometer 14-Nanometer First Intel server product release Q1 2010 Q3 2013 Q1 2016 Source: Intel. It took Intel three and a half years to move its server processor lineup from its 32-nanometer technology to its 22-nanometer technology. It then took the company two and a half years to move that lineup from its 22-nanometer technology to its 14-nanometer technology. History would suggest that it'll be sometime between the third quarter of 2018 and the third quarter of 2019 before Intel will begin fielding its first server processors built on its 10-nanometer technology. A third-quarter 10-nanometer server chip release, though less than ideal, wouldn't be the end of the world for Intel, but any later would just be plain risky. Ideally, though, Intel ought to get its 10-nanometer server processor lineup out comfortably in the first half of 2018. What will affect the timing of Intel's 10-nanometer server chip release? Two major factors could affect Intel's 10-nanometer server processor launch timing. First is simply product readiness. The chip designs need to be finished soon to support product sampling in the second half of 2017 and product launch in the first half of 2018. If Intel's development teams just don't get the chip design done in time, then the schedule must be pushed out. Even if the design is ready in time for an early 2018 launch, another factor that could influence launch timing will be the health of the 10-nanometer manufacturing process the chips will be built on. Intel's execution with its 14-nanometer process technology was poor, and the schedule for first 10-nanometer product production has already been pushed from late 2015 to the second half of 2017. If 10-nanometer yields aren't in good shape by the end of 2017, then even with the design ready, Intel will face a difficult choice: Does it ramp up the 10-nanometer server parts and suffer from a suboptimal cost structure, or does it hold off on releasing the new parts until the 10-nanometer technology improves? If Intel's competitors are as aggressive in trying to bring products built in TSMC's 7-nanometer to this market as TSMC claims, then taking a cost structure hit to maintain product performance and power leadership would be preferable to risking the loss of significant market share and average selling price erosion.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Microsoft Surface Book 2 Release Date, Details About Its Specs and Features as Well As the Surface Book i7, And More! Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: November 13, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» It’s been quite some time since tech enthusiasts have heard any news about the much-gossiped Microsoft Surface Book 2. The Microsoft Surface Book 2, has been overshadowed by another product of the Microsoft family, the Microsoft Surface i7. The newly launched Microsoft 2-in-1 laptop is indeed worthy of all the adoration it is getting. Given, its unrivaled performance specs and power, lead many skeptics to believe that the Microsoft Surface i7 is, in fact, Microsoft Surface Book 2. Here’s what we know till now, the new Microsoft Surface i7 newly launched in the Microsoft October event, to the pleasure of several laptop fans. The highlight of the device was its dual-core Intel Core i7-6600U chip, consisting of a custom NVidia GeForce GPU. It also came boasting a 1GB GDDR5 memory, according to PCWorld. It’s hyped as the “crème de lacrème,” and is manufactured by giants like Microsoft and Intel themselves. Leading many people to believe that it might be the Microsoft Surface Book 2 they have all been waiting for. Previously, people thought that the Microsoft Surface Book 2 would sport the upcoming Intel Kaby Lake processors plus, the Intel HD Graphics 520 GPU. According to TechRadar, it is also believed to support 4K video and architecture. On the wish list of major upgrades and changes, what Microsoft fans wanted, was to see longer battery life of Microsoft Surface Book 2. This is because the laptop allegedly drains only after use of 4 hours. While the Surface i7 has a battery life of 16 hours reportedly. Another wish list for the Microsoft Surface Book 2 was a development on its prominent feature: the hinge, as it was susceptible to accumulate dust and receptacles. Fans wanted a separable screen, or, at the very slightest, a hinge that is functional. Although we know that expecting the Surface Book 2 to come out this year would be mere wishful thinking. However, we can certainly hope that in the coming year it will be launched alongside the also much awaited Microsoft Surface Pro 5. According to rumors The Redmond-based tech Goliath was expected to the seventh-generation of Intel processor, the Kaby Lake in this new model of the successful notebook. It will be a complete blessing for the Surface Book 2, the Kaby. It will make the use of USB 3.1 Type-C and provide Thunderbolt 3 support. The first should enable faster and more effective data transmission and battery charging. While the latter is labeled the fastest, most adaptable connection to any dock, display, or peripheral device, which ought to offer smooth connectivity and performance on the Microsoft Surface Book 2. The latest processor from Intel, toincreaseKaby Lake will also be manufactured on a 14-nanometer technology, it is to increase the performance of the chips by 12 percent about the Skylake, which is the among the initial Microsoft Surface Book and the i7 variety exhibited last month. The Microsoft Surface Book 2 is also likely to have a much better display, and this will also be to the credit of the Kaby Lake because it will enhance the performance of the graphics. According to TechRadar, as far as the design is concerned, on the front Microsoft has to think of a way of detaching the display from the software-based keyboard, a less complicated job. They have to do it in such a way so that it could be done even when the device is off.

"We estimate that TSMC could generate $5.5 billion in annual revenues from such a venture, leading to 20% revenue and earnings growth." This analysis doesn't stand up to scrutiny. Here's why. The current Mac supplier doesn't even generate that much The biggest problem with this analysis is that it assumes that TSMC will be able to charge Apple a whopping $300 per chip for Apple-designed Mac processors. This is absurd, because this would imply that TSMC would make significantly more from building each Apple-designed Mac processor than current Mac processor provider Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) makes on average from the chips it sells Apple. A quick way to "prove" this assertion is as follows: Apple ships roughly 20 million Mac computers each year, give or take a few million. If Intel sold processors to Apple at an average of $300 apiece, then Intel would generate roughly $6 billion per year in revenue from Apple. Per Intel's form 10-K filings for 2013, 2014, and 2015, Apple wasn't responsible for at least 10% of Intel's revenues in those years. In those years, Intel's revenue was solidly south of $60 billion, so we know that Apple pays much less than $300 for Intel processors on average. Further, even if Intel did take in that much per chip from Apple, Apple's per-unit costs would be lower for Apple-designed chips manufactured by a third party, since the third party isn't getting paid for the chip design. The iPhone opportunity is much larger than the Mac opportunity The Seeking Alpha post suggests that TSMC would have a bigger opportunity to profit from Apple's building an in-house Mac processor than it does from having a monopoly on the iPhone 7 A-series processor business -- as well as the A8, A8X, and A9X chips that currently power the iPad. That doesn't make sense. In Apple's last fiscal year, it shipped nearly 212 million iPhones and 45.59 million iPads. It shipped just 18.484 million Macs in that period. In terms of chip area, and therefore chip dollar content to TSMC, an Intel processor isn't much larger than a high-end iPhone or iPad processor. The A10 Fusion measures in at 125 square millimeters in TSMC's 16-nanometer process; the A9X comes in at 147 square millimeters. These are already large, high-silicon and thus high-dollar content chips to TSMC. Even if we assume Intel's average content across Apple's Mac lineup is twice that found in an iPad processor, TSMC's winning the Apple business over from Intel would amount to the addition of roughly 36 million iPad processors' worth of revenue. In TSMC's 2015 form 10-F filing, the company said its two largest customers, one of which is almost certainly Apple, each made up 16% of its total revenue in 2015. That means TSMC's Apple-related revenue in 2015 -- consisting of A8, A8X, and some A9 chip sales -- was around $4.12 billion. It's unlikely that approximately 18 million Mac processors could generate anywhere close to the kind of revenue for TSMC as all those other chips do combined. Indeed, even if TSMC can capture around $50 per chip for a potential Apple-designed Mac processor -- which is probably too high of an estimate -- then this would amount to annual revenue of less than $1 billion per year for TSMC. As TSMC's annual revenue approaches $30 billion, even $1 billion in incremental revenue would be good for only around 3.33% growth. That'd be good business, but hardly a game changer for the chipmaker. Indeed, capturing 100% of the A10 Fusion chip orders for the iPhone 7-series phones, up from a reportedly minority allocation for the A9 processors in the iPhone 6s-series phones, was probably a bigger deal to TSMC than a potential Mac win ever could be.

Ross Posted 1 Apr 2008 | 19:04 GMT Advertisement   Image: Intel; Charts: Michael Vella Not so long ago, competitive sorts would boast of the cycle rate of their PC’s central processing unit. But now it seems the only people who talk it up are the overclockers—hobbyists who push their CPUs beyond their specified limits. There are two reasons: CPU clock rates peaked a few years ago [see graph, top], and they aren't a very useful key to chip performance anyway. The clock keeps a processor's parts working in unison, like rowers on a galley ship. Other things being equal, the more ticks you have per second, the more work will get done. So why not push the clock faster? Because it's no longer worth the cost in terms of power consumed and heat dissipated. Intel calls the speed/power ­tradeoff a ”fundamental theorem of multicore processors”—and that's the reason it makes sense to use two or more processing areas, or cores, on a single chip. Intel reports that ­underclocking a single core by 20 percent saves half the power while sacrificing just 13 percent of the ­performance. That means that if you divide the work between two cores running at an 80 percent clock rate, you get 73 percent better performance for the same power. And the heat is dissipated at two points rather than one. So even though the cutting-edge logic chip gulps ever more power [see graph, center], it isn't about to melt its way through the floor. That bodes well for Moore's Law, which predicts that about every two years, ­manufacturers will double the number of ­transistors they cram onto a given bit of silicon. The fundamental theorem says that we'll still be able to make full use of those transistors for a good long time. If once the whole choir of transistors had to sing to the beat of a single metronome, now it can split up into sections—and harmonize. Count Paces? Or Measure The Distance Traveled? The rising power consumption of CPUs [graph, center] made it less attractive to focus on cycles per second, so clock rates stalled [graph, top]. A better gauge of performance, the number of instructions performed per second [graph, bottom], continued to rise without ­betraying any hint of the stall. That's because work once done in a single ­processor is now divided among several processing cores—four of them in the case of Intel's Quad-Core chip [below].

Here's Why? (Photo : David Ramos/Getty Images) Microsoft's Surface Book product line has celebrated its first anniversary last month after releasing its first-gen Surface Book. However, the 2-in-1 hybrid computer's upcoming successor, Surface Book 2, was overshadowed by the Microsoft Surface i7 launched at the October event. Now, rumors suggest that Microsoft is heading towards a late 2017 launching date of the upcoming Surface Book 2 because of the upcoming feature redesign and the Intel's Kaby Lake release. Microsoft has reportedly revamped the physical design of the laptop, most especially the dynamic fulcrum hinge which gathered negative reviews from the previous model. More so, the newly launched laptop will sport an improved battery performance and processing speed due to the changes made in its processor, which is currently running the Intel Core i7. According to CNET, the upcoming Microsoft 2017 flagship laptop is expected to feature a 16 hours battery life, 13.5 inch PixelSense display, two ports for USB 3.0, SD Card reader in full size, Mini Displayport and headphone jack. The Kaby Lake or the core i7 will double up the graphic performance as it is built on a 14-nanometer technology, which is said to boost the performance of chips by 12 percent compared to the Skylake. It will also add another fan to support GeForce GTX 965M video output. Kaby Lake's technology should enable Surface Book 2 to be equipped with USB 3.1 Type-C and Thunderbolt 3 support. The former should make for faster and more efficient data transfer and battery charging. The latter is dubbed the fastest, most versatile connection to any dock, display, or peripheral device, which should offer sleek connectivity and performance on the Microsoft Surface Book 2, according to Today. The 2-in-1 hybrid computer's screen is expected to deliver a crisp 4K resolution while playback of 4K video and 3D graphics should be a much smoother experience. Before the expected release for the Surface Book 2, Microsoft fans can check out first the Surface Book i7. The laptop sports a 13.5-inch PixelSense display with a resolution of 3,000 × 2,000 pixels, together with 10-point multi-touch capabilities. Furthermore, the device has a 5-megapixel front camera, an 8-megapixel rear camera, two USB 3.0 ports, an SD card slot, a 3.5 mm headphone jack, a Mini DisplayPort, a Surface Connect port, and a Surface Pen.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 13, 2016 at 3:31PM Many investors generally see stocks tripling as a long-term goal. But some stocks can also triple within a single year. Let's examine three tech stocks which tripled investors' investments over the past year, and whether or not they still have room to run. Image source: Getty Images. AMD If you had bought shares of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) when the stock dipped below $2 per share in February, you would have more than tripled your initial investment in just nine months. That's because the chipmaker staged a remarkable turnaround over the past year on the strength of its EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) business, which was bolstered by robust sales of its semi-custom SoC for PS4s and Xbox Ones. Those sales are expected to keep rising on console upgrades like the PS4 Slim, PS4 Pro, Xbox One S, and Xbox Scorpio. In the second quarter this year, AMD posted its first quarter of annual revenue growth since 2014. It followed up that 9% growth with 23% growth in the third quarter, and anticipates 6% sales growth for the full year. AMD returned to quarterly GAAP profitability during the second quarter, and non-GAAP profitability during the third quarter. AMD is also pushing back against Nvidia in the low-end "VR ready" GPU market with the Polaris-based RX 480, and plans to target the high-end market with its next-gen Vega GPUs in the near future. Although AMD remains a distant underdog to Intel in the CPU market, it plans to counter the market leader with its upcoming Zen CPUs. Oclaro Oclaro (NASDAQ:OCLR) is a manufacturer of optical components, modules, and subsystems for the service provider, enterprise, and data center markets. If you had bought shares of Oclaro last October when it hovered around $2, you would have quadrupled your initial investment. Oclaro directly benefits from the rising bandwidth needs of streaming video, cloud computing, application virtualization, and other data-intensive applications. That rising demand boosted its revenue by 55% annually last quarter, compared to 52% growth in the previous quarter and a 2% decline in the prior-year quarter. Most of that growth was fueled by growth in its "100G and beyond" portfolio of high-speed solutions, where sales rose roughly 20% annually for the fifth straight quarter. On the bottom line, Oclaro's non-GAAP net income rose from a net loss of $1.6 million to net income of $20 million between the first quarters of 2015 and 2016. It also reported GAAP net income of $3.4 million during the quarter, versus a loss of $3.5 million a year ago. Analysts expect that growth to continue, with revenue and non-GAAP earnings expect to respectively rise 44% and 206% this year. Weibo Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), commonly referred to as "China's Twitter (NYSE:TWTR)," has more than tripled in value since last October. That explosive growth can be attributed to its rapid growth in monthly active users (MAUs), which grew 33% annually to 282 million last quarter, compared to 36% growth in the prior-year quarter. The company -- which is owned by online media giant Sina (NASDAQ:SINA) -- has posted triple and double-digit sales growth in every quarter since its IPO in April 2014, and analysts expect its sales to rise 33% this year, compared to 43% growth in 2015. Those numbers are enormous when compared to Twitter's anemic 3% year-over-year growth in MAUs and projected sales growth of 15% this year. Weibo is also profitable by both non-GAAP and GAAP metrics, while Twitter is only profitable on a non-GAAP basis. Between the second quarters of 2015 and 2016, Weibo's GAAP net income rose from $4.2 million to $25.9 million, while its non-GAAP net income surged from $10.9 million to $35.5 million. Analysts expect its non-GAAP net income to more than double this year. Weibo's advertising and marketing revenue rose 45% annually last quarter, fueled by ad buys from small and medium sized businesses nearly doubling. It offers display ads, interest-based ad campaigns, event-based ad campaigns, and promoted feeds. Weibo's new live streaming platform, which allows viewers to buy virtual gifts from the company for their favorite broadcasters, is also boosting its revenue growth. The key takeaway Investors should always remember that past performance doesn't guarantee future returns. However, AMD is still in turnaround mode, while Oclaro and Weibo still seem to be firing on all cylinders. Therefore, I believe that these stocks could still have room to run, despite having more than tripled investors' cash over the past year. Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The Linux Foundation The line between containers and VMs can be thought of as a continuum, according to Graham Whaley, Sr. Software Engineer at Intel. In his keynote at LinuxCon Europe, he talked about the spectrum between fully featured, accelerated, secure, VM features all the way down to the barest minimum lightweight container. He says, “Some people want one end of the spectrum, really time-critical, other people want security. We don't have that today. What we'd like is a continuous choice of features. … That’s something we’re trying to enable.” Whaley also talked about two VM myths: VMs don't have to be big: “I've seen embedded systems running hypervisors with tiny amounts of RAM. Admittedly, that VM may not have the features that you want to run a container, but it's not actually that far off. Containers don't require that many features at the bottom end.” And they aren’t always slow: “Along with, or parallel with, ‘I'm big,’ comes slow. If you're not that big, it's pretty hard to be slow, if you're very very small. Yeah, VMs don't have to be this humongous behemoth that you can't really use in your container space because they're just too slow. That's a legacy thing. We can move beyond that." Whaley talked about “re-imagining what we can do in the whole container cloud stack” with the goal of making a tenfold improvement in performance. The key to getting this kind of performance improvement is to take a fresh look without assuming that you need something equivalent to a self-contained PC. Their approach is to “throw that away, start again, and pick out the pieces we need from the VM.” By being very selective and only including the bare minimum of what is needed along with also using some new technologies that increase performance, they are getting sub-50-millisecond boot times with around 50MB per container instance overhead. Whaley wraps it up with more information about next steps and where you can go to participate: “We do continue to optimize space and speed. Really, we want to look for that next tenfold improvement. What's that next leap of faith, that change of architecture? We are redefining what's possible. We're an open project. … The code is available now on GitHub. We have an IRC channel and mailing list. Come to the web site where there's Clear Linux, Clear Containers and Ciao.” Watch the entire video to learn more about the Clear Linux project and Intel’s approach to improving performance of containers and VMs. Log in or register to post comments Print This Like  (1 like) Click Here!

Elroy Bethell - November 13, 2016 7:32 AM Print Recipient E-mail Sender E-mail CPUs are always changing, always improving. In fact, to stay competitive chip makers have to continue horning their skills and improving their products. Intel constantly stays on top by bringing new tech to the market. We all have a desire to get the best of the best computers out there.  However, every computer user eventually comes to the realization that the computer they bought is either not powerful enough, or has too much power to be practical for their needs. If price is not an object, then too much power is not so bad.  I don’t think any computer is truly future proof, but high-end computer stuff is as close as you can get.  My wife wanted to buy me a laptop that housed a Core i3 processor. It was the lowest of the bunch and know I need much more power than that for what I do. But for someone else, a laptop with a Core i3 is a nice budget processor that may meet all their needs.      Photo Source: Intel   Picking a computer with an i3, i5, or i7 should be entirely based on your budget and computing needs. A Core i5 processor is a good mid-range point if you great computing power without spending too much money.     Photo Source: Intel      For most computing needs, an i7 processor is not a must have. However, it is always good to have a PC can take anything that you throw at it.      Photo Source: Intel       I am a mostly a high-end guy so here are few sweet high-end processors from Intel.       Processor Intel® Core™ i7-6800K Processor (15M Cache, up to 3.60 GHz) Intel® Core™ i7-6850K Processor (15M Cache, up to 3.80 GHz) Intel® Core™ i7-6900K Processor (20M Cache, up to 3.70 GHz) Intel® Core™ i7-6950X Processor Extreme Edition (25M Cache, up to 3.50 GHz) Price $434.00 - $441.00 $617.00 - $628.00 $1089.00 - $1109.00 $1723.00 - $1743.00 # of Cores 6 6 8 10 # of Threads 12 12 16 20 Processor Base Frequency 3.40 GHz 3.6 GHz 3.20 GHz 3.00 GHz Max Turbo Frequency 3.60 GHz 3.80 GHz 3.70 GHz 3.50 GHz Cache 15 MB 15 MB 20 MB 25 MB Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 Frequency 3.80 GHz 4.00 GHz 4.00 GHz 4.00 GHz Thermal Design Power (TDP) 140 W 140 W 140 W 140 W Max Memory Size 128 GB 128 GB 128 GB 128 GB   Source: Intel "We don't know how to make a $500 computer that's not a piece of junk." -- Apple CEO Steve Jobs Latest Headlines Here Goes Intel and AMD - Neck and Neck Again November 14, 2016, 5:00 AM Refurbished Desktops and More in Today’s Market November 13, 2016, 5:00 AM AMD Inspires Innovation Everywhere November 12, 2016, 1:00 AM Wi-Fi on Intel USB 3.1 November 11, 2016, 1:00 AM NVIDIA Corporation Scores the Microsoft Surface November 2, 2016, 8:27 AM Apple Launches New MacBook with Two Missing Items October 29, 2016, 1:00 AM More Headlines Most Popular Articles27” Curved Monitors – Samsung SD590 vs HP Pavilion 27c November 9, 2016, 2:00 AM Smart Thermostats - Nest Learning Thermostat vs Ecobee3 November 10, 2016, 1:00 AM Wi-Fi on Intel USB 3.1 November 11, 2016, 1:00 AM UTHealth Clinical Trial Shows Progress Using Stem Cells to Treat Traumatic Brain Injury November 8, 2016, 1:00 AM Uber Partners with Circulation to Pilot Program Connecting Transportation and Digital Health Care November 6, 2016, 5:00 AM Latest Blog Posts Cancer Screening in the Community Is there a link between Cancer and Poverty?

The company launched the updated version of its Blade notebook a few weeks ago. Razer has been selling it directly to customers since then but if someone wants to pick one up via Microsoft’s online store, they can now do that. Microsoft’s online store is offering the Razer Blade notebook in two different configurations. The updated Razer Blade notebook is powered by the latest Core i7-6700HQ processor from Intel coupled with 16GB of RAM. It features a full HD 14 inch display as well as an NVIDIA GTX 1060 graphics processor which makes this notebook ready for virtual reality. The Razer Blade is powered by Windows 10. All of this is packaged inside a body that measures 0.7 inches thick and comes in at just 4 pounds. No major changes have been made to the design of the notebook, everything that’s worth paying good money for is packaged inside the shell. Microsoft’s online store is selling the new Razer Blade with 512GB SSD for $1,999 and with a 1TB solid-state drive for $2,399. Interestingly, the 512GB configuration is already listed as out of stock so it’s unclear how long it’s going to take for this particular model to be back in stock. Filed in Computers.

Donald Trump’s promises trigger fears of a trade war that would damage Washington’s economy By John Webster johnwe@spokesman.com(509) 459-5421 Twitter Facebook Email Reddit Related topics China reportedly pumping brakes on U.S. deal-making after Trump win If President Donald Trump keeps the promises of candidate Donald Trump, he could trigger a trade war with China, dissolve tariff-reduction deals around the Pacific Rim, and inflict a “disastrous” blow to the economy of trade-dependent Washington state. So says Democrat Gary Locke, the Chinese-American trade expert who served eight years as Washington state governor, two years as U.S. secretary of commerce and three years as U.S. ambassador to China. But out in Eastern Washington’s crop-growing country, which voted strongly in favor of Trump, farmers feel optimistic that they can persuade the new president to govern differently than he campaigned. John Stuhlmiller, CEO of the conservative Washington state Farm Bureau, said it is true that China has a history of the retaliation Locke predicts – a retaliation that “would be terrible for our economy, absolutely.” But the need to avoid a trade war is why, Stuhlmiller said, “I would submit there is room for movement from rhetoric to reality.” Stuhlmiller said Trump’s policy advisers already have told the Farm Bureau that Trump will repeal the Obama administration’s Clean Water Act rules concerning runoff – rules that many farmers consider damaging and excessive. The president-elect’s responsiveness to farmers on that issue makes farmers optimistic that Trump will respond favorably to farmers’ concerns regarding foreign trade, Stuhlmiller said. Bigger even than agriculture is Boeing. It sells jets, made in Washington, around the world. In 2015, Washington made and exported $86.3 billion worth of merchandise. More than half – $51 billion – was civilian aircraft. The largest market for Washington state products? China, at $20.7 billion in purchases during 2014. Those purchases include Boeing jets, fresh Wenatchee cherries that fly to China by the planeload, Yakima Valley hops for the brewers of Asian beer, and frozen french fries made in Moses Lake from local potatoes and devoured by the ton at China’s more than 2,200 McDonald’s restaurants. Other buyers of Washington state exports include Canada at $9.3 billion in purchases, Japan at $7.4 billion, and Mexico at $2.7 billion. The manufacture and shipping of these export products account for 1 in 3 of Washington state’s jobs, according to the state Department of Commerce. Those jobs are in Boeing’s factories, Eastern Washington’s family wheat farms, Columbia Valley’s wineries, Central Washington’s orchards and the thriving Port of Moses Lake, where more than 2,500 workers assemble semiconductors for Intel, carbon-fiber body panels for BMW’s electric cars, Genie construction lifts and more. Those jobs, said Locke, are what is at stake – along with the U.S. trade deficit, which gets better when Washington’s exports improve and worse when they decline. What is it, exactly, that candidate Trump said to provoke these Washington state concerns? He promised repeatedly to impose a 45 percent tariff on goods made in China and sold to the United States. He also said he would scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an Obama administration trade pact involving 12 Pacific Rim countries; the deal awaits final approval in Congress, where leaders last week were calling it dead. China is not a party to the TPP, but many other Washington state trading partners are would-be members. He said he would renegotiate or scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he lambasted as a job-killing deal that gutted American manufacturing since its passage in the 1990s. Peter Navarro, a Trump trade adviser, explained in a Los Angeles Times op-ed that the 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports would be a “strategic negotiating strategy to stop China … from cheating on international trade deals.” China, Navarro wrote, “has been waging an undeclared trade war on the U.S. since joining the World Trade Organization in 2001. The casualties are obvious: More than 50,000 American factories shuttered.” Meanwhile, Navarro wrote, “the unfair trade advantages China reaps from lax environmental and health and safety regulations are written in blood: More than 60,000 Chinese workers perished in workplace accidents in 2014 and up to a half-million people die prematurely because of China’s horrific air pollution.” Robert Hamilton, senior trade policy adviser in the Washington state Department of Commerce, said if Trump imposes an across-the-board 45 percent tariff on Chinese products, it “would be a blatant violation of WTO rules. Does he intend to pull out of the WTO? He hasn’t said so, so it is unclear how he would proceed against China, Washington’s largest export market,” Hamilton said. Further, Hamilton said, “I understand President-elect Trump wants to renegotiate NAFTA, but he has provided no details about what he would propose. Moreover, Canada and Mexico will be at the table, too, and they will not just give concessions to the United States.” According to former Gov. Locke, if Trump imposes a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports, “China will reciprocate and put a similar tax on goods from Washington – whether it’s wheat, hops or Boeing airplanes. That will force Chinese buyers to buy from Brazil or Chile or Australia in terms of agricultural products and from Europe in terms of airplanes.” “They don’t have to buy from Boeing,” Locke added. The market for passenger jets is competitive; Airbus eagerly would sell to China if retaliatory Chinese taxes and tariffs made Boeing’s U.S.-made jets uncompetitive in price. If retaliatory trade policies block Washington state companies from selling to China, “it means layoffs” for Washington workers, Locke said. “It could be quite disastrous for jobs in the state of Washington,” he said. In addition, Trump’s threatened tariff on Chinese products would raise the price of the merchandise Americans buy at stores like Wal-Mart, Home Depot and Macy’s, Locke said. “That will be taken out of the pockets of American workers.” Primary provisions of the TPP, Locke said, are agreements to lower tariffs currently imposed by U.S. trading partners, and to bind those countries to improve the treatment of their own workers and cut down on the use of hazardous agricultural chemicals. In return for those agreements, nations in the TPP secure the mutual benefits of freer trade, Locke said. If other countries “can make things without health and human safety standards, it puts American companies at a disadvantage,” Locke said, because U.S. producers do invest in higher standards of health and safety. “That’s what TPP is trying to address, is level the playing field” so U.S. products have a fair shot in the competition for foreign buyers. Regarding the TPP, the Farm Bureau agreed: In its meetings with the new Trump administration, Stuhlmiller said, “Ag is going to be saying ‘Please support it.’ ” Under terms of the TPP, stringent U.S. environmental standards “would be a base for others to have to attain to. Others would have to pay more to produce crops, and that gives us an advantage; our products must become more cost-competitive,” Stuhlmiller said. “Where we excel is we have the world’s safest and best food supply. It goes at a premium,” Stuhlmiller said. This premium quality has contributed to the worldwide success of Washington’s big-money crops such as apples, cherries and wheat, he said. But it takes a level playing field, with lower tariffs and comparable production rules, for trade fully to benefit makers and buyers alike, he said. According to the Farm Bureau, the TPP would increase Washington state’s export income by $246 million per year and add more than 1,350 jobs to the state’s economy. Boeing, like the Farm Bureau, has expressed the hope it can work out concerns with the president-elect. After Trump’s election victory, the company issued this formal statement: “We congratulate president-elect Trump and newly elected members of Congress and look forward to working with them to ensure that U.S. companies can compete, win and grow our economy to provide good jobs to U.S. workers; as well as preserve American leadership in national security.” Will Trump, who campaigned to increase U.S. jobs and reduce the deficit in U.S. trade, respond to the concerns of Washington state export industries? Stuhlmiller predicted he will: During campaign season “rhetoric is rhetoric.” But governing, he said, is a different story. “We hope we will be able to reason our way through these things and find the right policy path forward. Farmers are the eternal optimists. We put everything at risk every year and hope the Lord provides the rain.” Published: Nov. 13, 2016, 6:15 a.m.  Tags: apples, Boeing, cherries, china, Donald Trump, farm bureau, foreign trade, jobs, NAFTA, Washington state economy, wheat Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Unlimited Digital Access Print edition home delivery Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Why the MacBook Pro reviews are all wrong Nate Swanner - Nov 13, 2016 75 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit If you take a look around the web, you’ll already find plenty of reviews about the new MacBook Pro. To date, only the non-Touch Bar 13-inch model has been made available, with other models arriving sometime next week (if you ordered early). All told, the reviews are less than glowing, with many likening the computer to a farce foisted on us by Apple. That’s certainly one way to look at it, but there’s probably something a bit more obvious at play. The ‘Pro’ computer Reading through the reviews, a few things becomes fairly evident. First, the new keyboard is going to be polarizing (I happen to love it) with its shallow key travel. Second, the massive trackpad is a welcome addition. Another notable feature on the 13-inch model is the screen. While the same resolution as the previous Retina Pro models, it’s now a lot brighter and supports the P3 color gamut. It’s just plain beautiful. But there are some professional-level disadvantages. It’s got a pretty basic CPU, the GPU is limited to Intel’s offering, and the two Thunderbolt 3 ports are going to leave you buying dongles — another not-so-pro feature many are complaining about. For all the complaining, one thing is certain: the new 13-inch, non-Touch Bar Pro is not a ‘pro’ computer at all. Often, reviews append their long-winded ranting with that notation at the end, but it misses the mark. This is Apple’s fault What we’ve quickly forgotten is that most of those reviewing the new Pro (the pesky tech press, wouldn’t you know) were ardent fanboys of the MacBook Air. I can’t tell you how many conferences I’ve been to, only to see a sea of Airs floating through the halls while I lugged my Pro around. We’ve (the royal ‘we’ here) also lost track of the biggest complaint about the Air: the screen. For so long the only thing the tech press wanted was an Air with a Retina screen. It would be the perfect computer, they’d say. Then they got one — except Apple dubbed it a ‘Pro’ computer. The Air was judged apart from the Pro because it was this sliver of aluminum Steve Jobs slipped out of an inter-office envelope and positioned as the entry-level MacBook to encompass the world outside of Pros. You know, the 99 percent (sorry ‘pros’… complain all you want, but you’re not what matters). It had pretty ho-hum specs and a middling screen resolution — but oh, the form factor! So slim, so pretty… so portable, and easy to balance on a lap while live-blogging a keynote speech from a tech conference! Instead of simply rebooting the Air lineup, Apple gave us a confusing Pro stable to pick through. Do we want the Pro non-Touch, or one with Touch Bar — and 13 or 15 inch? Did you need more RAM? Yeah, that’s only available on the 15-inch version. Sorry. The Pro is not a Pro Apple calling the 13-inch non-Touch Bar MacBook Pro (and screw them for making me type that, it’s a stupid-long name) a ‘Pro’ at all is problematic. Instead of simply rebooting the Air with a Retina screen — you know, that thing we wanted — Apple rebooted the Air with a Retina screen and called it a Pro. Except it’s not a Pro. It’s an Air… with a Retina screen. But the tech press is holding the computer to a different standard than it would a new Air, despite being very aware of what they’re doing. If Apple had simply called its basic offering a new Air, the only knock would be the form factor being exactly like the Pro (and probably Thunderbolt ports, but whatever). Even then, we wouldn’t care much… at least we’d know where it stood in the lineup. And then we’d have that ‘Air with a Retina screen’ so many have always wanted. I mean, Apple even pulled the 11-inch Air from circulation, and isn’t updating the 13-inch model. It’s clearly trying to exhaust its existing supply chain — so what other indicators do we need that the Air is dead and this new thing is its replacement? The naming scheme is Apple’s fault, but it’s poor form on the tech press for not being able to see through it more directly. That so many hold the low-end Pro to the ‘Pro’ standard Apple sets is silly. Call it what you like, it’s clearly the new Air — and should be judged as such.

The latest six-month extension began on July 26. © REUTERS/ Philippe Wojazer Year After Paris Attacks EU Not Totally Safe Despite Heightened Security - Ex-Intel Officer "The state of emergency allows us to make arrests and employ other administrative measures that are very effective… Therefore, yes, we will probably extend the emergency state for a few more months," Valls told BBC's HARDtalk program.

The prime minister noted that the risk of attacks similar to those that targeted Paris on November 13, 2015, leaving 130 people dead, was decreasing. However, Valls noted, there is still a menace of attacks similar to what happened in Nice in July, where a truck rammed into a crowd, killing 86.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 12, 2016 at 5:04PM The Internet of Things (IoT) -- which connects wearables, smart home appliances, and other devices to the internet -- has been widely hyped as the next big growth market by tech companies. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) claims that the number of connected devices will surge from 15 billion in 2015 to 200 billion by 2020. That's a whopping 26 smart objects tethered to every person on the earth. Image source: Getty Images. Bullish forecasts like those sparked a land grab in the IoT market, with companies often pumping out connected objects before considering the privacy and security implications. That lack of oversight became brutally clear recently with a series of cyberattacks which exploited unsecured IoT devices to take down major websites like Twitter, Shopify, and Spotify. If these attacks get worse, could the dream of connecting "everything" to the internet suddenly seem like a really bad idea? Rise of the robots One of the most common ways to knock a website offline is with a DDoS (distributed denial of service) attack. In this attack, hordes of devices which are infected by malware act as "bots" to continually flood traffic to a targeted site and knock it offline. In the past, these networks of infected devices, called "botnets", were mainly comprised of computers. As the security of traditional PCs improved, botnets spread toward other connected devices like smartphones and tablets. But now that mobile OS defenses are improving, hackers have started targeting IoT devices. Many security experts have warned that many IoT devices can be hacked with simple attacks which were blocked on PCs years ago. Nonetheless, many companies looking to capitalize on the growth of the IoT market threw caution to the wind as they launched a wide array of connected devices. This created the perfect opportunity for IoT botnets to strike. The Mirai botnet, which primarily targets remote cameras and home routers, was recently used in several major DDoS attacks on cybersecurity journalist Brian Kreb's website, French web host OVH, and internet directory service Dyn, plus the entire internet infrastructure of Liberia. To make matters worse, the source code for Mirai was recently released online, guaranteeing that more advanced Mirai-based attacks will follow. Will those "smart home" dreams evaporate? The security problems plaguing the IoT could hurt tech giants, which are trying to establish smart home ecosystems. Big players in this market include Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Google's Nest, Home, and Cast products create a smart home ecosystem which controls the temperature, answers questions, receives commands, and "casts" music and video to various screens and audio devices around the home. Samsung's SmartThings ecosystem connects various smart appliances to each other and its mobile app. Apple's HomeKit tethers third-party devices to its iOS app, while Amazon does the same with its Echo smart speakers. Facebook hasn't formally entered the smart home race yet, but it's already teased a home AI platform for controlling connected lights and thermostats. Google Home. Image source: Google. These companies all want to expand their internet presence into physical homes to increase user dependence on their hardware, software, or services. But if Mirai-like attacks continue knocking websites offline and making global headlines, consumers will likely think twice before upgrading all their "dumb" appliances to "smart" ones. So who's trying to protect the IoT? The Mirai botnet sounds scary, but companies are developing countermeasures, just as they previously did with PCs and mobile devices. Companies on the front line include networking giant Cisco, cybersecurity giant Symantec, and next-gen firewall vendors Palo Alto Networks and Check Point Software. Threat prevention firms like FireEye have also been improving their software to recognize these IoT-based botnet attacks. There are also new security measures in the RTOS (real-time operating systems) which run on IoT chips. ARM Holdings, which was recently acquired by Softbank, previously beefed up the security of its mBed RTOS with the acquisitions of security firms Offspark and Sansa Security, as well as a partnership with IBM. Intel's IoT chips run on its VxWorks RTOS, which is secured by Intel Security (which is being spun off with a majority stake sold to TPG) software, which is tethered to Intel's IoT Gateway. The road ahead... These efforts indicate that progress is being made, but the IoT market can be tough to secure due to the wide variety of different devices on the market. This hardware and software fragmentation makes it easier for hackers to exploit vulnerabilities and harder for security companies to counter the attacks. If this continues to happen, the bullish sentiment for the IoT market could fade, but cybersecurity companies would benefit from rising demand for IoT security services.   Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

New Photo of the x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Gets Leaked GO Here is the Dell Stack along with its planned dock Nov 13, 2016 07:38 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Earlier this week, it has emerged that Dell wanted to build an x86 Windows 10 Mobile device tackling several markets at the same time, as it was supposed to play the role of a phone, tablet, and desktop using the full power of Windows 10. Called Dell Stack, this device was originally designed in 2014 and planned for launch in 2017, but for the moment, it’s believed that both Dell and Microsoft gave up on the project, so it might never see daylight. And yet, new photos get leaked to the web thanks to leaker Evan Blass, who just posted a photo showing the Dell Stack along with its dock, which is believed to support Continuum and offer charging at the same time. As you can see in this pic, the Dell Slack seems to be very thin, which makes many wonder how could an Intel Kaby Lake processor be installed under the hood, given the fact that cooling is critical for an x86 chip. For the moment, however, there are quite a lot of uncertain things, especially because neither Microsoft nor Dell confirmed that they still want to release the phone. Possible specs According to leaked information, the Dell Slack was designed with a 6.4-inch display and was supposed to launch in several hardware configurations boasting either 4 GB or 8 GB of RAM. Depending on version, users would have been allowed to get up to 256 GB of storage space, with microSD card obviously supported for additional space. In terms of processors, Dell wanted the Slack to come with a choice of three different Intel Kaby Lake Y x86 processors, including m3, m5 vPro, and m7 vPro. This would have ensured x86 app support, without compromising battery life, although there’s no information regarding battery capacity. Since Dell originally planned to launch the Slack in 2017, there’s still hope that the company could bring it to the market at some point, so fingers crossed to see this going live. x86 seems to be the only way to save Windows phones and tackle the lack of apps, and it’s believed that Microsoft itself is also looking in the same direction with its planned Surface Phone. #Dell#Windows 10 Mobile#Windows phone#Microsoft subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news After iOS and Android, Windows 10 Mobile Finally Getting Authenticator App Windows 10 Mobile Phone with Physical Keyboard in the Works Microsoft Releases Windows 10 Mobile Build 14393.448 HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile First Impressions Microsoft Pledges to Completely Retire Office 2007 Next Year Firefox 50.0 Officially Released for Linux, Mac and Windows, Here's What's New Some U.S. Android Phones Have Secret Backdoor That Sends Data to China Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall Microsoft Pledges to Completely Retire Office 2007 Next Year X.Org Server 1.19.0 Officially Released, Coming Soon to a Linux Distro Near You Red Hat Software Collections 2.3 and Red Hat Developer Toolset 6 Available Now Linux Kernel 4.4.32 LTS Adds Networking Improvements, Updated AMDGPU Drivers    Dell Slack and its dock New Apps ChemPlot: Create chemical molecule structures using simple drawing tools wrapped in an intuitive interface, lock, group and edit objects, save projects and print results DxWnd: Open games and other applications that only run in full screen in a custom window mode that you can resize and lock anywhere on your screen with this app Portable Firefox: A reliable, fast and secure web browser that enables you to easily navigate on the Internet on the go, directly from a portable device GdPicture.NET Document Imaging SDK: Full-Featured and Royalty Free Document Imaging toolkit for .NET allows you to implement viewing, processing, printing or scanning files SmartFTP FTP Library: Integrate FTP and SFTP file transfer capabilities into your software with the help of this advanced FTP library ActiveX component (COM) Norton AntiVirus Virus Definitions: Signature packanges containing the latest free virus databases for various Symantec antivirus software for both home and business use Curse: Connect, chat, share files and send messages to friends from the games you are playing fast and easy with this intuitive application Reader comments HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile: The PC Experience more on: HP Elite X3 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Sections Machines Discoveries Space Futures Gaming Earth Videos About en de es fr it nl pt The VICE Channels Share Tweet Motherboard Motherboard Watch Sections Machines Discoveries Space Futures Gaming Earth Latest Videos Documentaries Interviews Machines Discoveries Space Futures Gaming Earth Follow Motherboard Newsletter Image: Lane V Erickson/Shutterstock The Network Standard Used in Cars Is Wide Open to Attack Written by Michael Byrne Editor November 12, 2016 // 10:00 AM EST Copy This URL The networked electronics found under the hood of modern automobiles enable a great many useful and cool things, such as fuel-saving engine optimizations, parking assist mechanisms, collision avoidance systems, and myriad further applications most often involving sensing and the passing of data among vehicular systems and human drivers. As is pretty much always the case when electronics become networked, this connectivity also offers hackers new potential exploits. According to research presented last month at the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security in Vienna, courtesy of computer scientists at the University of Michigan (and Adrian Colyer's excellent The Morning Paper), the controller area network (CAN) protocol implemented by in-vehicle networks has a new and potentially quite dangerous vulnerability. The attack, known as a bus-off attack, exploits the CAN's built-in error handling facilities to potentially nuke both contemporary insecure CANs and future secured versions. First off, CAN is a fairly old technology. It was first developed and published by Bosch in 1985, with CAN-ready processors released by Intel and Philips in 1987. CAN made it into an actual car (the BMW 8 Series) in 1988, and was made the international standard for in-vehicle networks in 1993. Nowadays, it's pretty common and there are several spin-off protocols, such as CANOpen and DeviceNet. Prior to CAN, auto electronics were connected device to device as needed. If, say, a dashboard indicator, water pump, fuel injection controller, and diagnostic computer all required temperature readings from the engine, then we'd expect a wire strung from the thermostat to each one. Multiply this ad hoc topography across an entire car and the result was an unwieldy nest consisting of miles of of wires. CAN fixed this by implementing a bus architecture. Every component in CAN is hooked into the same backbone across which messages are transmitted in a unified format. Crucially, this means that each device only needs to have a single network interface rather than however many are needed to connect to x number of other devices. The result looks kind of like a local internet network, where every message to and from the greater internet is actually received by every other computer on the local network. It's just that those meant for other computers are filtered out. In CAN, the collision-avoidance system might not care about engine temperature, but it will still get those messages. That system knows, however, that it doesn't care about the temperature data and so it's able to safely discard/filter out that data. This brings us back to the proposed new vulnerability. According to the UM researchers, Kyong-Tak Cho and Kang Shin, it's possible to take advantage of CAN's built-in error handling mechanism in what amounts to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Error information is passed among Electronic Control Units (ECUs) in the form of error frames, which are standardized messages containing two data fields where further error details can be specified in the form of flags (where one bit in a particular position is flipped to indicate something useful). When any ECU node along the bus detects an error, it sends out a message in the form of an error frame. This nukes all traffic currently on the bus and tells every other ECU that they need to resend whatever they were in the process of sending. Simple enough. There's more to it, however. Every ECU node maintains an internal error counter. When a node realizes that it's either sent or received a bad message, it not only sends out the aforementioned error frame, it increments this counter by some amount (eight ticks for sending a bad message, one for receiving a bad message). When an ECU's error counter hits 128, it goes into passive mode. Future error messages from passive nodes will no longer nuke everything on the bus. When a counter hits 255, the corresponding ECU will lose its access to the bus completely. When this happens, things turn sour for the whole automobile system, which may shut down completely or enter a "limp-home" mode. Image: Cho et al "Since the bus-off is a serious problem, in most cases, vehicle systems are designed to first enter a 'limp home' mode (when it occurs) with all their parameters set to pre-set values, and thus run with reduced functionality (e.g., limited engine RPM)," Cho and Shin explain in a paper that accompanied their presentation. "In this mode, warning lamps are lit up on the dashboard to alert the driver, and the vehicle runs only for some time before it is properly serviced by an OEM-authorized service center. Depending on the severity of the underlying issue, a vehicle in the limp home mode will later be totally disabled." It's thus possible to disable one or more components of a car by flooding a CAN's bus with error messages. This isn't a simple undertaking, but it can certainly be accomplished with some dedication. There are three conditions an attacker would have to meet to pull this off: 1) The spoofed message must have the same ID as an existing message; 2) the spoofed message must be sent at the same time as that existing message; and 3) the spoofed message must have a particular flag set establishing it as dominant over the real message so that the real message is ignored by the various devices connected to the bus. The first condition is trivially easy and is just a matter of having an ECU connected to the bus that has no filtering in place, such that it receives every message on the network and can determine based on this what the next message's ID will be. The second is likewise easy because messages are passed around the CAN at fixed intervals—it's just a matter of clock synchronization. The final condition is not as easy (or easy to explain, anyhow), but is still totally reasonable to implement. The neat thing is that once you unleash one of these error messages, the CAN will sort of do the rest of the work for you. The ECU node whose message you faked will see the error, increment its error counter, and then attempt to resend the message. But, it will only be seeing the spoofed message, not its own original message, because we made the spoofed message dominant. So, it will just keep copying and sending our bunk message until it's forced off the data bus. Mission accomplished. "If the attacker targets a message sent with high priority (i.e., a low ID value) and small message intervals, then the attacker would most likely disconnect a safety-critical ECU that sends important messages related to, for example, vehicle acceleration or braking," Cho and Shin explained. This was, by the way, demonstrated in actual vehicles. As it turns out, this vulnerability is fairly easy to fix. For one thing, it's easy to detect because the repetition of error frames implies something nefarious is going on—normally, the source of the erroneous message would take action to correct the message before resending. The attack can be further confirmed by the presence of an error message that remains in active mode after the passive mode counter has maxed out. This would only be possible if the same message were being sent by two different ECUs. "Even though the proposed attack has not yet been seen in the wild, it is easy to mount and also directly related to drivers/passengers’ safety, and should thus be countered with high priority," Cho and Shin conclude. "Moreover, the facts that the proposed attack can nullify state-of-the-art solutions and is easy to launch, make it even more important to design and deploy its countermeasures."

Jump to Navigation Linux Foundation Collaborative Projects Core Infrastructure Initiative News Announcements In The News Blogs Grants Programs Resources FAQ Contact Twitter Facebook Google+ YouTube LinkedIn Menu The Linux Foundation's Core Infrastructure Initiative Renews Funding for Reproducible Builds Project Date Published November 11, 2016 Share Grant Helps Fund New Developers Working on Debian GNU/Linux and FreeBSD to  Improve Software Security and Control SAN FRANCISCO, November 11, 2016 — The Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII), a project managed by The Linux Foundation that enables technology companies, industry stakeholders and developers to collaboratively identify, fund and improve the security of critical open source projects, today announced continued financial support for the Reproducible Builds Project. The grant extends the contribution to include Debian developers Chris Lamb, Mattia Rizzolo, Ximin Luo and Vagrant Cascadian, as well as extending funding for Holger Levsen. Furthermore, this contribution adds support for Ed Maste, working with FreeBSD.   While anyone can inspect the source code of free software for malicious flaws, most Linux distributions provide binary (or compiled) packages to end users. The motivation behind "reproducible" builds is to allow verification that no flaws have been introduced during the compilation process by endeavouring that identical binary packages are generated from a given source. This prevents the installation of backdoor-introducing malware on developers' machines as an attacker would need to simultaneously infect all developers attempting to reproduce the build.   “Ensuring that no flaws are introduced during the build process greatly improves software security and control,” said Lamb. “Our work has already made significant progress in Debian GNU/Linux, and we are making our tools available for Fedora, Guix, Ubuntu, OpenWrt and other distributions. Support from CII will allow us to expand our efforts to work on longer-term commitments such as upstream patches requiring significant technical and time investment, as well as work on the infrastructure required to make Reproducible Builds both meaningful and approachable for end-users.”   Technical advantages of a reproducible build include removing unsafe behavior, such as downloading third-party code from the internet, detecting corrupted build environments, reducing time-to-detection of a build host compromise, as well as numerous other debugging and testing advantages.   Last year CII funded Levsen and Jérémy Bobbio’s efforts to eliminate unneeded variations from the build processes of thousands of free software projects. They also delivered new tools to understand the source of these differences and an infrastructure update to allow developers to independently verify the authenticity of binary distributions. Their efforts, combined with those from the rest of the Reproducible Builds Project, have resulted in 91% of the packages within the Debian testing distribution becoming reproducible.   About The Core Infrastructure Initiative CII is a multimillion-dollar project that funds and supports critical elements of the global information infrastructure. It is organized by The Linux Foundation and supported by Amazon Web Services, Bloomberg, Cisco, Dell, Facebook, Fujitsu, Google, Hitachi, HP, Huawei, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, NetApp, NEC, Qualcomm, RackSpace, salesforce.com, and VMware. Moving beyond funding projects, CII is introducing preemptive tools and programs to help the open source ecosystem and the companies who support it deploy secure coding practices.

About The Linux Foundation The Linux Foundation is the organization of choice for the world's top developers and companies to build ecosystems that accelerate open technology development and commercial adoption. Together with the worldwide open source community, it is solving the hardest technology problems by creating the largest shared technology investment in history. Founded in 2000, The Linux Foundation today provides tools, training and events to scale any open source project, which together deliver an economic impact not achievable by any one company.

The Surface Book 2 has yet to be made available. Changes are expected for the upcoming installment of Microsoft's Surface Book after users complained about the device's functionality.  Reports indicated that users of the Microsoft Surface Book all faced similar problems surrounding its design. With the negative feedback regarding the device, many are expecting the company to have a fix for these problems in the upcoming product.  One of these problems was the Surface Book's hinge. Many were complaining that the hinge did not allow the device to close, allowing for dirt to enter it. This brought about a lot of criticism from users and is one of the things that Microsoft will reportedly be changing.  That being said, the new Surface Book is said to address this by presenting a big change to the line. Microsoft will apparently be turning the hinge into a standard one in order to fix the problem. With that, many can look forward to a better device that will also be more aesthetically pleasing.  The upcoming Surface Book 2 is said to be similar to its predecessor in terms of some of its aesthetics too. However, a lot of other improvements are expected. It was stated that the new model will allow for better graphics, reaching up to 3840 x 2160 pixels. In addition, it will likely include Intel's new Kaby Lake processor which will boost the device's performance. The battery life of the device is also going to be improved. Since the device also features the highly acclaimed Surface Pen, innovations on the accessory are expected as well. With that, Microsoft is said to include a built-in dock that will power up and recharge the additional gadget. This change is pivotal for the franchise, as the Surface Pen is one of the device's selling points.  However, there has yet to be any news on the official specs of the upcoming device. Many are expecting it to be unveiled early 2017. Fans will have to wait for more updates on the matter.  Copyright © 2016 Ecumenical News Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin it RECOMMENDED Ukrainian conflict East Europe's worst crisis since World War 2, says archbishop S.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 13, 2016 at 11:28AM The global cybersecurity market could grow from $122.45 billion today to $202.36 billion by 2021, according to a new report from Research and Markets. The firm believes that growth will be driven by an increase of connected objects across the Internet of Things, relaxed BYOD (bring your own device) policies at work, and the need for tighter application security. Image source: Getty Images. It also estimates that the banking, financial services, and insurance market vertical will experience the highest growth due to the rising adoption of web and mobile apps, and that the Asia Pacific region will experience the highest growth as growing markets like China and India deploy more cybersecurity solutions. That forecast sounds bullish, but investors should also examine these four other stats to understand how rapidly the cybersecurity market could grow within the next few years. Stat number one Nearly 178 million personal records were exposed in data breaches in 2015, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center. Nearly 70% of those breaches occurred in the healthcare sector, and almost 20% occurred at government/military agencies. These organizations will likely increase their cybersecurity budgets considerably in the near future, which means more business for "best in breed" perimeter defense companies like FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) and Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW). FireEye's threat prevention platform identifies incoming threats before they strike, and Palo Alto's next-gen firewalls prevent them from reaching internal networks. Larger companies with bundled security solutions -- like Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) -- will also likely see stronger demand for their security appliances and services. Stat number two The global cost of handling cyberattacks is expected to rise from $400 billion in 2015 to $2.1 trillion by 2019, according to estimates from Lloyd's and Juniper Research. That includes direct damage as well as post-attack disruptions. Payroll giant ADP, hard drive maker Seagate, the FBI, the IRS, and the Department of Homeland Security -- which were all struck by data breaches this year -- all know how costly these attacks can be. While larger companies and organizations are gradually responding to these threats, Cisco's 2016 Annual Security Report found that just 29% of small to medium-sized businesses used basic security tools like configuration and patching to prevent breaches -- down from 39% in 2014. Stat number three Despite that apparent complacence, 52% of respondents in CyberEdge Group's 2015 Cyberthreat Defense Report believed that their companies would be hit by successful cyberattacks within the year. That fear is certainly justified -- Symantec, best known to consumers as the maker of Norton Antivirus, recently discovered that three quarters of all websites had exploitable vulnerabilities. Companies like Symantec are also evolving into "all-in-one" guardians for these businesses and organizations. Symantec recently acquired security firm Blue Coat to add its network and cloud protection services to its core portfolio of security solutions for PCs, data centers, and emails. That move makes it an "end-to-end" security provider which offers "layers" or protection, which previously required services from multiple vendors. Stat number four 43% of data breaches were caused internally, according to a report from Intel Security last September. Half of those breaches were accidental, caused by poor security practices, while the other half were intentional -- caused by disgruntled employees and malicious insiders. Although internal data breaches are rising, most cybersecurity companies only focus on external threats with firewalls and threat prevention systems. The standout performer in the internal data breach market is CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR), the market leader in PAM (privileged account management) solutions. CyberArk's platform locks down compromised systems and quarantines internal threats before they can spread to other parts of the network. The key takeaway Investing in most cybersecurity stocks today isn't for queasy investors, since many of these high-growth players have high valuations, low profits, and are prone to wild price swings. However, less risk-averse investors should still keep one or two cybersecurity stocks in their long term portfolio since the market still remains ripe for long-term growth and consolidation.

I do. At 7 pounds and nearly 2 inches thick, mine was (not so) affectionately known as the “Back Breaker 3000.” And I had to travel with this beast, no less. Fast forward to today, and now we’ve got the world’s thinnest laptop at less than 1 centimeter, and weighing under 2.5 pounds. After spending a week with the Acer Swift 7 ($999), a 9.98-millimeter (0.39-inch) Windows 10-powered laptop, here’s my thoughts on it. Design, display Available in matte black and with gold trim, the Acer Swift 7 is quite the looker. Open up the clamshell laptop to reveal the well-spaced island keys and extra-large trackpad with indented, curved edges. The 13.3-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS display, with 16:9 aspect ratio, is also worth noting for its crisp text and vivid color. Acer Color Intelligence technology dynamically optimizes screen color, brightness and saturation, in real-time. All I know is that HBO’s Westworld and my Steam library of games look pretty darn sweet on it. The screen is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass, but be aware, it doesn’t support touch -- which may be a deal-breaker for some. This is the case with other ridiculously thin 13-inch laptops like the HP Spectre ($1,249.99) or MacBook Air ($999.00). Stereo speakers, powered by Dolby Audio Premium and Acer TrueHarmony, also help deliver great sound, too. There’s also a headphone jack on the right-hand side. Power, battery Thanks to the 7th generation Intel Core processor, the Acer Swift 7 delivers fast performance across various tasks. It’s an Intel Core i5 chip (1.2GHz), so there’s certainly faster processors on the market, but I found it speedy and reliable, and with smooth app loading and multitasking – likely due in part to the 8GB of system memory (RAM). Battery life fell just below 9 hours, which is great. One of the first PCs with 7th Gen chip, these new computers are built for 4K Ultra HD video and gaming, virtual reality (on some systems), and cool extras like facial login -- so you don't need to remember your passwords. Expect big things from Intel’s 7th Gen Core processors in 2017. And there’s faster wireless connectivity, too; this 802.11ac-based Acer Swift 7 offers up to 3 times faster wireless performance than before. Storage, ports In the capacity department, the Acer Swift 7 ships with 256GB of SSD storage. That should be enough to fit many thousands of documents and photos, and a good number of video files, and computer games – with plenty of room to spare. Considering the popularity of free cloud services and streaming services (for TV shows, movies and music), storage is becoming less of an issue than it was a few years ago. One small beef for me is no full-size USB ports – only a pair of USB 3.1 Type-C ports – which is also like the above mentioned HP Spectre and new MacBook Pro. Yes, I made the argument storage isn’t as much of a concern these days because of the cloud and streaming services, but personally I like having at least one USB port for memory sticks or other peripherals, or at least a microSD or SD card slot. And I’m not a fan of adapters. Summary At under a grand, the Acer Swift 7 is a jaw-droppingly thin laptop that gushes with style. While it might not break any benchmarking records, the computer’s impressive performance should more than suffice, for all kinds of applications. The only downsides are the lack of a touch screen and no full-size USB ports, but this might not be a big deal for many. At the very least, if you’re looking for a new laptop, get your hands on this super slender machine at a store near you. Follow Marc on Twitter: @marc_saltzman.

It's Been Five Years Since The Open64 5.0 Compiler Release Written by Michael Larabel in Compiler on 13 November 2016 at 09:33 AM EST. 4 Comments This week marked five years since the release of the Open64 5.0 compiler in what is the latest and likely last-ever release of this once-promising code compiler. Open64 5.0 was released back in 2011 and unfortunately there hasn't been a release since. Last year we wrote how the Open64 project vanished. A few days after that article, it was said back on 27 March 2015, "The websites and SVN servers are down for maintenance and will be back soon." A year and a half later, Open64.net hasn't returned and the project still seems to be discontinued/abandoned without any official communication. Their mailing list also remains a virtual ghost town. AMD's Open64 compiler suite they previously maintained for AMD CPUs also hasn't seen a release since 2013 and appears abandoned as well. Somewhat related, the Portable C Compiler (PCC) has also been virtually silent. There has been some relatively recent developments at least as of the beginning of 2016 and in 2015 they enabled C11 support by default, but no release since 2014. Their FishEye source code development viewer to show any new development activity has also been offline for an unknown amount of time while the official project site remains quite bare. At least GCC and LLVM/Clang continue providing competition to one another and keep advancing in-step as open-source, well-supported compilers. Promising commercial but closed compiler efforts remain from the likes of Intel and PathScale. 4 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

About Us Contact HOME Financials Technology Consumer Discretionary Healthcare Energy Gaming Search Technology Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Tipped To Refresh Its Most Popular MacBook Offering: Report Published By Blake Audett at November 12, 2016 08:25 am Last month, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) made big waves in the tech world with the release of its new and shiny models of the MacBook Pro. However, the Cupertino-based tech giant did not reveal a refreshed line of its MacBook Air which led users to believe that the company is on the path of discontinuing its entry-level notebook offering. Interestingly, a new publication from the International Business Times AU notes that Apple is still looking to refresh its current-generation MacBook Air. Even though the 13-inch model of the new MacBook Pro is slimmer and lighter than the current MacBook Air but MacBook users were still left devastated when they found out that the company could potentially discontinue one of its most popular and certainly cheapest notebook offering. Hence, Apple would not want to risk upsetting its users, so the arrival of the much-discussed MacBook Air 2017 is still on the cards. MacBook Air 2017: International Business Times AU states that the first thing that users can expect from the nex-generation MacBook Air is that the device should be slightly thinner and lighter, compared to the new models of the MacBook Pro. Also, it is unlikely that the next-gen MacBook Air will incorporate standard USB A ports. Instead, the upcoming notebook is tipped to harness faster connectivity of the new USB Type-C ports. Furthermore, Apple would want to incorporate new features in its next-gen MacBook Air, similar to the Touch Bar introduced on the new MacBook Pro. There are rumors that the upcoming notebook could sport an E-ink keyboard, designed by Sonder Design, which could help the device stand apart from its competition. It would be highly welcomed if the next-generation MacBook Air arrives with the latest Intel Kaby Lake processing chipset, but nothing is confirmed regarding this aspect. Unfortunately, Apple continues to remain secretive regarding its upcoming projects which make it tough to assess what its next MacBook Air notebook will feature. Hopefully, the Cupertino company has lined up a host of surprises in an updated version of its most popular notebook offering, ever.  Stay tuned for more updates regarding Apple’s upcoming projects.

Contacts Economy Arts&Culture Electronics Science Sport Worldwide Medicine Local Electronics Instant Emoji Touch Bar: A Look Inside Apple's New MacBook Pro Charles Sherman Nov 13, 2016      For the purposes of this article, we're only looking at the high-end 15 inch MacBook Pro notebooks, as they provide the best performance. The only available model is the base 13-inch MacBook Pro that comes without the fancy Touch Bar and this one is priced at U.S. $1,499. So anyone who wants a secondary monitor for their new MacBooks may opt for LG's 5K display. Apple has recently announced a long awaited update to its MacBook Pro laptops at an event in San Francisco. Much like the 12-inch MacBook, the MacBook Pro now has butterfly mechanism keys, allowing for less travel and a thinner chassis. Faced with a promising new competitor in the form of Microsoft's Surface Studio, Apple finally unveiled its new MacBook Pro during the company's keynote event on October 27. Apple is also keeping the old MacBook Pro models, which start at United States $1,299. In terms of design, the new Macbook Pro lineup is 4mm thinner than its previous generation model and weighs half a pound less. As for the new MacBook Pro 2016, the prices in the USA are $1,499 for the 13-inch model without a Touch Bar, $1,799 for the one that comes with it, and $2,399 for the 15-inch top variant. Obviously, this is not a monitor with Apple's own branding, which is an unusual veering away from Apple, who is nearly always intent on using proprietary products for respective functionalities or accessories that support its main products. The USB 3 ports have been replaced with four Thunderbolt 3 ports - USB-C cables can be plugged into these. Speaking of the main Retina display, Schiller said the new MacBook Pro's screen is brighter and has a wider color gamut than its predecessor; 2,560-by-1,600 resolution at 227ppi on the 13-inch and 2,880-by-1,800 resolution at 220ppi on the 15-incher. Any of the thunderbolt ports can be used to charge the device. It is worth noting that the slimmest laptop available are the HP's Spectre and Acer's Swift 7, both running on the seventh-gen "Kaby Lake" Intel Core i7 processors and both less than 10mm thick. The 13inch MacBook Pro (2.9GHz Intel i5, 8GB RAM, 256GB onboard storage) with standard function keys will sell at $1,499 and $1,799 with the new Touch Bar. You can check out all the models as well as their prices over at Apple.com via link below. The Touch Bar-equipped 13-inch MacBook Pro starts at USA $1,799 while the two 15-inch MacBook Pro versions, coming with Touch Bar, start at U.S. $2,399 and United States $2,799.

As a female engineers it can be a little horrible working in the tech industry, due to high rate of sexism. But nevertheless, there are so many female Engineers who are currently successful in the tech industry and their stories can serve as an inspiration for young and innovative female students out there. There has been a huge push these days to encourage more girls to learn coding and to hire more women engineers once they graduate. Because, women are vastly outnumbered by men in technical jobs to about 3:1 and that is why sometimes it is necessary to give a shout-out to these female Engineers. Like it was mentioned, there are so many but in this list we present to you, 10 Inspirational Female Engineers In The World. 10) Erica Baker. Company: Slack. Title: Senior engineer.

The inspiring part of Erica’s career is how she landed a top engineering job at Slack. Erica Baker made headlines when she wrote a post on Medium titled “The Other Side of Diversity” in November 2014. She talked about how difficult it was for a black woman to rise up in Silicon Valley. At that time Erica was an engineer at Google “I know this: I am not my job. I am not my industry or its stereotypes. I am a black woman who happens to work in the tech industry. I don’t need to change to fit within my industry. My industry needs to change to make everyone feel included and accepted,” Baker wrote. Reports from leading tech firms reveal that, on average, 71% of employees are men, 29% are women, 60% identify as white, 23% Asian, 8% Latino, and 7% black.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Dell Stack + Dock looks gorgeous (new render) 4 by Surur  @mspoweruser Nov 12, 2016 at 14:25 GMT4 days ago Talking about devices from the graveyard, Evan Blass (aka evLeaks) has posted another render of the Dell Stack, a Windows 10 tablet with LTE capabilities that would have allowed consumers to carry their whole work environment with them, and dock to access larger screens and keyboards when in the office. Telephony would have been managed via VOIP apps like Skype making it a full featured device for most work needs. The picture shows the dock above, and demonstrates how thin the envisioned device is. The handset was supposed to run Windows 10 on a full Intel Kaby Lake mobile processor, so we assume the second slot was for an extra battery. The device  was envisioned as a 6.4 inch to 7 inch Full HD mini tablet/phablet style device which would be the brains for a desktop, laptop and tablet-like experience and would have featured between 4GB to 8GB of RAM (the first on a mobile device), with 128GB and 256GB of Storage coming along for the ride. In 2014 the device was expected to ship in 2017, though the project is currently believed to have been shelved. Read more about the device here.

Linux Kernel 3.12.67 LTS Released with Many PowerPC and CIFS Improvements GO All users of the Linux 3.12 LTS kernel branch must update Nov 13, 2016 23:20 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Linux kernel maintainer Jiri Slaby announced the release and general availability of the sixty-seventh maintenance update to the long-term supported Linux 3.12 kernel series. The Linux 3.12 LTS (Long Term Support) series was supposed to reach end of life earlier this year, but will be maintained for one more year, until spring 2017, because it is currently used in the SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE) 12 operating system, which just received its second Service Pack (SP) a few days ago. And now, Linux kernel 3.12.67 LTS is here to address various issues since the last point release. "I'm announcing the release of the 3.12.67 kernel. All users of the 3.12 kernel series must upgrade," said Jiri Slaby. "The updated 3.12.y git tree can be found at: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git linux-3.12.y and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser: http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git;a=summary." Mostly CIFS and PPC improvements, but also updated drivers According to the appended shortlog and the diff from Linux kernel 3.12.66 LTS, the Linux 3.12.67 LTS kernel release changes a total of 82 files, with 716 insertions and 391 deletions. Among the improvements implemented in this update, we can mention numerous fixes for the CIFS file system, and a couple more for the EXT4, ISOFS, NFS, UBIFS, and ReiserFS filesystems, as well as small mm, perf, and IPC bug fixes. There are also various improvements for the PowerPC (PPC), x86, MetaG, ARC, and MIPS hardware architectures, and updated drivers, in particular for things like general-purpose input/output (GPIO), MD, MMC, I2C, Ethernet (Intel i40e and Mellanox mlx4), s390, SCSI, UIO, and USB. If you're using a GNU/Linux distribution powered by a kernel from the long-term supported Linux 3.12 series, please update to version 3.12.67 at your earliest convenience.

This add-on will render the Vive VR wireless and is available for preorders in China for $220.  ( HTC Vive USA ) Advertisement Vive, a virtual reality headset, is a product developed by HTC in partnership with Valve. It delivers one of the best virtual technologies to the world. Back in April, Taiwanese company HTC started a program called the Vive X. Under this program, HTC would support and endorse startups working on virtual reality (VR) development. The program was funded with $100 million and now the results are becoming clearly visible. A Wireless Add-On HTC has recently released an add-on tool that would cease the need for the HTC Vive VR headset's wires and souped-up computer gaming. Simply, this new upgrade kit would provide a wireless virtual reality experience with the headset. A preview of this tetherless kit for the HTC Vive virtual reality headset was showcased at Alibaba's 11/11 Global Shopping Festival held at Shenzhen, China. This upgrade kit was designed by TPCast, which is also under the Vive X Program. HTC has already opened the wireless upgrade kit for preorders for $220 in the Chinese market. Attaching this add-on to a VR headset would turn that headset into a wireless device. Unfortunately, the add-on would only improve user experience with the HTC Vive VR headset with no drastic changes implemented at this time except for the lack of clutter made by the presence of cables and wires. More so, the wireless add-on has a built-in battery that would only last users for an hour and 30 minutes, which still is very convenient and certainly lasts longer than standard virtual headset batteries. The chances of HTC upgrading the battery for a better version in the future are high. Preorder Outside China HTC opened up preorders for this tetherless upgrade add-on only on its Chinese website. Although that was the case, interested buyers can still order the kit online. However, buyers will have to cover the additional charges for handling and shipping fees in any Asian country. Additionally, HTC has decided to limit the number of available units to be sold for this Vive VR headset upgrade box. The company will also prioritize buyers who already have the Vive serial number, allowing these people to get ahead of the queue. The Taiwanese company has not yet announced whether the wireless upgrade kit will be released in the United States and the rest of the world at this time. The add-on is the third wireless VR headset in the industry but most probably the first to be made available for purchase already. Aside from HTC, tech companies like Intel, Qualcomm and Facebook are working on developing its respective standalone wireless VR headsets that might be released in 2017. But HTC might have beaten them first in the game with the release of their wireless add-on box especially since users do not need to buy a new headset but just attach the add-on atop the Vive VR headset.

Join For Free Access the survey results 'State of Industrial Internet Application Development' to learn about latest challenges, trends and opportunities with Industrial IoT, brought to you in partnership with GE Digital. Two weeks ago, I attended ARM TechCon, the annual developer conference showcasing the latest offerings from ARM and its partners (see my colleague Yan’s blog on Red Hat’s partnership with ARM). There were a lot of new products (new and improved processor cores, radios and other IP), announcements with key themes around IoT (Internet of Things), mobile, security, automotive functional safety, and embedded software development. This was the first TechCon after ARM was acquired by Softbank for $32B this summer, so there was great interest in hearing what Masayoshi Son (Chairman & CEO of Softbank) would say in his first public appearance with ARM. Masayoshi Son talked about connected and intelligent IoT devices enabling an explosion of new technologies, just like the Cambrian Explosion enabled thousands of new species on Earth, and suggesting that this will lead to 1 trillion IoT devices in 20 years. This will lead also to the Singularity — when machine intelligence exceeds the collective intelligence of humans. To the conference audience, this raised concerns about the possibility of conflict between humans and machines in the near future. He also emphasized the importance of security and why it will be critical in this highly-connected IoT environment. ARM CTO/CEO Keynotes Mike Muller (ARM CTO) in his keynote talked about innovations in healthcare driven by ARM technologies, including polio vaccination tracking through wearables and cancer screening through smell sensors (and even a deodorant from Unilever that activates only when needed). Simon Segars (ARM CEO) shared a perspective of IoT gleaned from data collected from over 700 businesses that provided some interesting comparisons. In 2013, 96% of the companies surveyed believed that in three years, they would be using IoT in some way. In 2016, in a survey of the same companies, 75% believed that IoT has had some impact on their business. This shows that the adoption of IoT is happening widely, though not at a scale that people expected. Security Everywhere Security was a big theme at the conference. ARM is making a big push for making ARM-based solutions more secure end-to-end–from the microcontroller to the cloud. TrustZone security mechanisms have been part of the last several generations of ARM processors. TrustZone is hardware-based security that prevents non-secure software from accessing secure resources directly. CoreLink SIE-200 now extends TrustZone to cover the entire the SoC. ARM is also bringing TrustZone to microcontrollers based on the ARMv8-M architecture to secure them from attacks. Combined with CryptoCell (which provides cryptographic services), ARM now has a very compelling hardware-based security solution.  Device Management With mbed Cloud ARM also announced a SaaS offering to manage mbed-powered devices. This is additional to the mbed operating system that ARM offers for Cortex-M based devices. With mbed Cloud, you can now connect, provision and update mbed devices. The mbed Cloud offering is scheduled for availability in Q1 2017. Blockchain Meets IoT In the expo, there were quite a few demos showing blockchain with IoT use cases. IBM showed a “smart parking” use case where blockchain was used to share parking meter data across various stakeholders (city, meter operator, customers). Trustonic, an emerging security technology vendor, showed how blockchain can be used for Root of Trust on TrustZone-M to secure systems that have modules from third parties. Both of these blockchain demos won the best of show awards as well. Intel @ ARM When you see Intel presenting at the ARM conference, you know that the power center has realigned in the semiconductor universe. Granted, it was Intel’s custom foundry group making a pitch to fabricate ARM chips, but there were quite a few Intel staff at ARM TechCon. It helps since the conference was a stone’s throw from Intel’s headquarters in Santa Clara. However, having ARM chips fabricated with Intel’s state-of-the-art processes will be a big benefit for end customers.
