Here Are the Best Chromebooks Tuesday November 15, 2016 8:52 am So, what is an Ultrabook anyway? Tweet Posted by Andru Edwards - Categories: Editorial, Microsoft, PC / Laptop If you've been shopping for a laptop lately, you may have a vague idea that "ultrabook" means "lightweight" and "small" but otherwise you may be a little confused about why some laptops are called ultrabooks and others aren't. It's understandable – this is one of those areas where names sort of caught on and many different manufacturers started using it, often with different ideas about what it meant. Here are the major points that define an ultrabook, and more importantly the top ultrabooks, and why they matter if you are getting ready to buy a computer. Brief History Ultrabook was actually a term created by Intel by in the early 2010s to market a very specific type of laptop – a thin laptop that was still as powerful as larger, bulkier versions (maybe even more powerful). The name was designed, of course, to show customers that Intel processors could do a lot more with less, and so were worth the purchase. Several Intel partners created these top ultrabook lines, which meant that the term was widely used by several brands at once, essentially saturating the laptop world. It's no wonder then that the term caught on and soon used a bit more loosely throughout the industry – but still referring to those core concepts that Intel had in mind. Size Ultrabooks are very thin – just how thin can vary because laptops are getting thinner all the time, but generally they are laptops that make you pause and think, "Wow, that's really thin." Around three quarters of an inch thick is the largest that the best early ultrabooks got. General design and displays also tend to be small: Most ultrabooks have a 13-inch screen, and rarely get any larger (some 14-inch and 15-inch models are out there). This makes ultrabooks more suitable for on-the-go work, and a little less useful for design work or entertainment. They also tend to be generally more flexible or hybridized than their larger cousins, often coming with touchscreens and styluses to support different work styles. Performance Ultrabooks are also notable for their high-end performance. These laptops won't be competing with gaming computers any time soon, but then generally have enough RAM, enough storage, and a powerful enough processor to handle most tasks. They are often even more powerful than larger laptops and may equal desktop models in some regards. That processor, by the way, is almost by definition an Intel chip (although there are several different lines of Intel processors, each with their own unique qualities). The Intel brand is why few people ever think about MacBooks as ultrabooks, no matter how thin they get – and the power is why lightweight, light-spec models like Chromebooks are very rarely referred to as ultrabooks. Price Ultrabook prices vary, but because they tend to have cutting edge specs, you usually have to pay for them. This differentiates them from Chromebooks, which often sell for only a few hundred dollars. Something like the Microsoft Surface Book, on the other hand, can easily cost $2,000 or more because of its advanced specs as the best ultrabook. Market Definition These days, ultrabook is used as a product definition term – if you see the word ultrabook, you as a consumer know to expect several things: A very thin, very portable laptop that still tends to have as much power as is possible – and a price tag to match. This helps divide the laptop market into different categories to speed up shopping. For example, if you are looking for a great travel laptop for business purposes, you may want to only look at laptops labeled as ultrabooks, because this is exactly what you need.

Intel announces $250 million for autonomous driving tech Posted 9 hours ago by Kristen Hall-Geisler (@kristenhg) 0 SHARES Next Story Google’s AI Experiments help you understand neural networks by playing with them When Intel decided to take a crack at its first keynote at an automotive event, it swung for the fences. The company’s CEO, Brian Krzanich, took the stage at the Los Angeles Auto Show‘s Automobility event this morning to announce that Intel Capital would be investing $250 million in autonomous driving over the next two years. Technologies that will benefit from the investment include connectivity, context awareness, deep learning and security. The goal of autonomous cars is to improve safety by removing as much human error as possible, which requires the vehicles and their data to be safe and reliable. Intel’s processing power itself comes into play with the amount of data required for autonomous driving. Krzanich pointed out that cars are already equipped with a variety of sensors, cameras and controllers that create, gather and transmit data. He said the automotive industry needs to be prepared for 4 terabytes of data being generated by every car every day. The fact that Intel chose to make this announcement at the LA Auto Show’s press days highlights the massive crossover that’s happening between technology and transportation. Representatives of every major car manufacturer were at CES 2016, one of the biggest shows for consumer electronics. The North American Auto Show will debut Automobili-D, its tech-focused event in January 2017. And this is the first year of Automobility, the rebranded tech event at the LA Auto Show. As cars become devices that we drive (or not) and devices become more integrated with our transportation experience across modes, including bike sharing and public transit, cross-pollination between tech companies and auto manufacturers is becoming more than the norm — it’s becoming a necessity.

Hawkins@andyjayhawk Nov 15, 2016, 3:39pm EST share tweet Linkedin In a keynote speech during the LA Auto Show today, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said his company will spend $250 million over the next two years toward the development of autonomous vehicles. It’s a significant sum of money and a clear sign that the computer chip manufacturer is serious about playing a large role in the future of automobiles. But that doesn’t mean that Intel is about to create its own fleet of self-driving cars. After all, the process of building a car from scratch is incredibly complex and expensive. Intel sounds like it’s more interested in what goes into the technology that powers a self-driving car than building the car itself. "Fully" is the key word in Intel's news today In a statement, Intel says the investment will help “push the boundaries on next-generation connectivity, communication, context awareness, deep learning, security, safety and more.” In other words, Intel wants to be the company that processes the data powering the self-driving cars made by auto manufacturers like BMW. Previously, the German automaker said it was partnering with Intel and Mobileye, the Israeli supplier of driver assistance systems and sensors that supplies a large percentage of the auto industry, to produce fully autonomous vehicles by 2021. "Fully" is the key word in Intel's news today. Production vehicles today already offer various forms of partial automation like dynamic cruise control and lane assistance, and more advanced systems like Tesla's Autopilot and GM's Super Cruise. But a fully self-driving car — something akin to the Google car — is an entirely different level of capability and complexity where you simply summon your vehicle, get in, and let it take you wherever you want to go without needing to intervene or pay attention. Intel is not well-known for its software, but it has been playing catch-up in a number of different spaces, including AI, machine learning, and the Internet of Things. Intel isn’t the only tech company investing heavily in self-driving cars. Practically every automaker and tech startup is working on the technology as well. Nvidia, the GPU manufacturer, and Baidu, the Chinese search giant, are working on a self-driving car platform. And the federal Department of Transportation under the Obama administration has said it aims to spend $4 billion over 10 years on pilot programs to test (and create regulations around) connected and autonomous car technologies.

  Home Topics Archives About Contact  RSS Headlines « Ford working with Bloomberg Aspen Initiative on Cities and Autonomous Vehicles | Main Print this post Intel to invest more than $250M over next two years in autonomous driving; “Data is the new oil” 15 November 2016 In a keynote address at the AutoMobility LA conference, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced that Intel Capital is targeting more than $250 million of additional new investments over the next two years to make fully autonomous driving a reality. This is the first time Intel is keynoting at an automotive conference, signifying how critical the automotive market has become for the company. These investments will drive the development of technologies that push the boundaries on next-generation connectivity, communication, context awareness, deep learning, security, safety and more. Drilling down into the areas that will be fueled by the fresh investments, Krzanich highlighted technologies that will drive global Internet of Things (IoT) innovation in transportation; areas where technology can directly mitigate risks while improving safety, mobility, and efficiency at a reduced cost; and companies that harness the value of the data to improve reliability of automated driving systems. When it comes to the car of the future and automated driving experiences, data is literally the new oil. Data has the potential to radically change the way we think about the driving experience: as consumers, as automakers, as technologists and as citizens of our communities. In fact, as a technologist, one of the trends I see as most disruptive to almost every industry is the enormous flood of data driven by the proliferation of smart, connected devices. —Brian Krzanich In his talk, Krzanich noted that in 2016, the average person generates 650MB of data a day through use of their PCs, mobile phones and wearables. By 2020, projections show that the average person will generate 1.5GB of data a day. Despite the impressive ramp up, however, that volume of data is paltry compared to what will be generated by autonomous vehicles. Each autonomous vehicle, supported by it platoon of sensors—cameras, radar, sonar, GPS and LiDAR—will be generating approximately 4,000 GB—i.e., 4 terabytes—of data per day, Krzanich said. Cameras will generate 20-60 MB/second, radar upwards of 10 kB/s, sonar 10-100 kB/s, GPS will run at 50 kB/s, and LIDAR will range between 10-70 MB/s. Every autonomous car will generate the data equivalent of almost 3,000 people. Extrapolate this further and think about how many cars are on the road. Let’s estimate just 1 million autonomous cars worldwide—that means automated driving will be representative of the data of 3 billion people. Just as oil has transformed our world over the last century, data is poised to transform our world for the next hundred years – and beyond. —Brian Krzanich In his talk, Krzanich differentiated between three types of data generated and used by autonomous vehicles: Technical data. This data comes from the car’s sensors that interpret the difference between a child or an animal, a fallen branch or a traffic cone and directs the outward decisions and movements of the car. This data takes an incredible amount of compute power, and whoever has the best data can develop the best artificial intelligence tools of machine learning, deep learning algorithms and data analytics. Societal and crowdsourced data. Data from the world around the vehicle, such as traffic, influences how the car gets from point A to point B, and how the car can change course to point C. The Waze app is a good example of this type of data today. With this data, whoever has the most data will be able to develop the best applications. Personal data. Data that tracks how many people are in the car, music preferences of each passenger, or even what stores or brands passengers prefer and, when you are near them, tees up sale items. Wearables and other sensors inside the car can also monitor behavior, focus, emotional and biometric status to increase safety and security. Whoever has the most personal data will be able to develop and deliver the best user experience. Data is truly the new currency of the automotive world. It’s not enough just to capture the data. We have to turn the data into an actionable set of insights to get the full value out of it. To do that requires an end-to-end computing solution from the car through the network and to the cloud – and strong connectivity. —Brian Krzanich In addition to the requirement for copious, low-cost, non-volatile memory; field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs); and cloud systems, Krzanich said, 5G communications will be fundamental to realizing the promise of autonomous vehicles.

Comments By Agam Shah Follow IDG News Service | Nov 15, 2016 12:07 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Computer Processors Computer Hardware Servers Comments CPU performance increases were ignored for years, but AMD put them back on the map with its upcoming Zen chip. This has rubbed off on Intel in a good way. Intel's taken its fastest server chip, the top-line 22-core Xeon E5-2699 v4 chip, and made some tweaks to squeeze out more CPU performance. It has created a new chip called the 22-core Xeon E5-2699A v4, which is about 5 percent faster. While 5 percent may sound like a small number, it's big for those installing thousands of servers running on the chips. Four-socket servers can have up to 88 CPU cores and run up a 20 percent gain in performance improvements. The new chip could also be used in workstations with the latest GPUs to create VR content or run engineering applications like SolidWorks. The new chip is a sign that Intel's paying more attention to CPU performance. Each new chip generation has normally brought about a 10 to 20 percent boost in CPU performance. But Intel executives, during a recent phone call, talked about the need to pack more speed into server chips to run demanding applications. That's especially highlighted in the 72-core Xeon Phi chip code-named Knights Landing, which is now being tweaked for artificial intelligence uses. The question remains if Intel can ever match AMD's claim of a 40 percent improvement gain with Zen. Intel's new 22-core server chip is based on the Broadwell architecture. Intel plans to release new server chips based on Skylake in the middle of next year, which will also boast performance gains. Intel's latest PC chips are based a new architecture called Kaby Lake, but the company is often slow to bring new architecture to its server chips. Intel achieved the CPU performance gains by making tweaks to its 14-nm process, which in the past has proven problematic. The early Broadwell chips for PCs were delayed because Intel had manufacturing problems, but the chipmaker hit its stride with Skylake and is making further chip improvements. The Xeon E5-2699A v4 runs at a clock speed of 2.40GHz and has 55MB of L3 cache. It has integrated networking, storage and I/O support, and cache allocation is more efficient. Intel dominates the server processor market, with more than a 90 percent share. But competitors are catching up, and it's taking Intel by surprise. The world's fastest supercomputer, called TaihuLight, is based on a homegrown Chinese chip, while ARM is being adopted by Fujitsu to build one of the world's fastest supercomputers in Japan.

News & Analysis Intel Preps its AI Strategy Deep learning may be Xeons inflection point Rick Merritt 11/15/2016 02:30 PM EST Post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. — Intel is showing at the Supercomputing 2016 show this week two new versions of its Xeon processor and a new FPGA card for deep learning. The demos are just the tip of the iceberg for a soup-to-nuts offering in machine learning the company will announce at an event on November 17. The industry has been waiting to hear Intel’s plan for machine learning, one of the hottest areas to emerge in semiconductors in recent years. “I think [Intel CEO] Brian Krzanich will bet the company,” said Nigel Toon, chief executive and co-founder of Graphcore, a startup with its own AI processor that recently snagged $30 million from investors including Intel archrival Samsung. Intel’s been making a few investments of its own. In recent weeks, the PC giant acquired two hot processor startups in neural networking—Nervana and Movidius. They add to Intel’s $16.7 billion acquisition of Altera whose FPGAs are already being used to accelerate search, networking and other jobs in the data centers of Baidu and Microsoft. Meanwhile Intel continues to position Xeon Phi, a massively multicore x86 processor, as its key weapon against graphics processors from Nvidia and AMD. At IDF in August it said the Knights Mill version of Phi, the first to act as both host and accelerator, will ship in 2017. Machine learning presents what former Intel CEO Andy Grove might have called a critical inflection point. Intel dominates the high margin market for server processors, but machine learning demands more performance on highly parallel tasks than those chips offer. Intel debuts today a new Arria 10 PCIe card for deep learning. (Images: Intel) Google is already using its own ASIC to accelerate the kind of inference tasks in machine learning Intel targets with a new PCI Express card using an Altera Arria FPGA. Facebook designed its own GPU server using Nvidia chips for the computationally intensive job of training neural networks. Meanwhile, Nvidia launched its own GPU server earlier this year, and IBM and Nvidia collaborated on another one using Power processors. For its part, AMD rolled out an open software initiative for its GPUs earlier this year. All are vying for sockets in a deep learning hardware market forecast to grow from $436 million in 2015 to $41.5 billion by 2024, according to market watcher Tractica. The potential is fueling a tactical rise in investments in semiconductor startups such as Graphcore, Wave Computing and Cornami in addition to the two Intel bought this year. “Nervana was bought for the software — I don’t think the hardware was strong enough to push forward,” said Toon of Graphcore, although one Intel manager suggested Intel will aim the Nervana hardware at the enterprise market for private clouds. “Movidius is well aligned to [Intel’s] RealSense [3D camera] line for low power systems at the edge of the network and the Internet of Things,” Toon said. Indeed Intel and Movidius were partners in with car maker BMW prior to the acquisition. “I’m not sure how Altera fits to be honest,” said Toon who joined the FPGA maker in 1988, helping it launch and run its business in Europe. “Intel may try to use FPGAs as machine learning accelerators in some way but having been involved in FPGAs, I don’t think that’s the right approach,” he said, noting his multicore chips will be more powerful than either FPGAs or GPUs for deep learning.

português suomeksi svenska Packet Introduces Global ARMv8-A Bare Metal Cloud to Power Container and IoT Workloads The company's new "Type 2A" configuration enables developers to deploy high density compute at 1/10th the cost per core of Intel-powered machines News provided by Cavium, Inc. Nov 15, 2016, 13:55 ET Share this article NEW YORK, Nov. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Packet, the leading bare metal cloud for developers, today announced a new ARM®v8-A based on-demand server configuration, available to deploy in less than ten minutes from its data centers in Parsippany (NJ), Sunnyvale (CA), Amsterdam (NL) and Tokyo (JP). The ARMv8-A option - powered by a pair of 48-core Cavium (NASDAQ: CAVM) ThunderX chips - makes Packet the first cloud provider to offer a 64-bit ARM server with the same elastic benefits of Intel-powered solutions. The 2A server is priced at $0.50/hr, or $0.005/core per hour (about 1/10th the cost per core of Packet's existing Intel-powered Type 2) and is available in minutes via API, portal or widely used DevOps tools such as Terraform and Ansible. "Making a powerful, low-cost ARM compute node available to developers has been a dream of mine for years," said Zachary Smith, CEO at Packet. "With the support of the Cavium and SoftBank teams, as well as our hardware and ecosystem partners, we're thrilled that users can take advantage of ARMv8-A powered bare metal at this incredible price point with the same experience as our x86 solutions." Unlike lower-end ARMv7-A variants, the ARMv8-A architecture powering Packet's bare metal Type 2A is designed for high density data center workloads and thrives on tasks like container-based applications, data processing, threaded application workloads and network heavy functions such as load balancing. To encourage rapid adoption, Packet also announced full 64-bit ARM support for Ubuntu 16.04, as well as a pipeline that includes CoreOS, FreeBSD and CentOS. "Packet is enabling genuine choice in the data center market with an instantly available ARMv8-A 64-bit server solution that is a direct challenger to legacy providers," said Jeff Underhill, director of server programs, ARM. "The combination of outstanding performance at a compelling price is bolstered by Packet's access to a wide range of developer networks anxious to test their workloads on ARM processor-based servers." Cloud native (Docker, Kubernetes, Mesos) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are natural workloads for ARMv8-A as they are highly portable and do not require the same tie-in with Intel processors. Packet's offering follows a recent investment by SoftBank, who acquired ARM Holdings for $32 billion in September. "Packet brought the public cloud experience to single tenant bare metal," said Rishi Chugh, Director Marketing, Data Center Processor Group at Cavium. "The ARM-based high density server platform, built on Cavium's award-winning workload optimized ThunderX processor, further accelerates the enablement of next generation cloud applications that power the modern internet and technology of tomorrow."

The new small form-factor PC is based on Intel’s Apollo Lake system-on-chip and thus features improved general purpose performance, graphics, and multimedia playback. The ECS LIVA Z comes in a small 117×128×33 black enclosure, which is a bit larger than the Apple TV STB and about the same size as Intel’s entry-level NUCs. While the LIVA Z has rather advanced media playback capabilities and has both HDMI and mDP outputs (as well as a TRRS connector for analog audio), ECS positions its new SFF system not as a media-centric PC, but rather as an affordable miniature computer. This is a reason why the LIVA Z does not come with a remote control or even an IR receiver, but has two GbE ports in addition to 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0. For peripherals, the system has three USB 3.0 Type-A ports as well as a USB 3.0 Type-C port. The heart of the ECS LIVA Z is an Apollo Lake SoC, which brand and model numbers the manufacturer does not disclose, but FanlessTech claims that the chip is a desktop part with 10 W TDP. Anyway, we do know that Intel’s Apollo Lake chips feature up to four x86 cores based on the latest low-power Goldmont microarchitecture, a new graphics core that features Intel’s ninth-generation architecture (Gen9) with 12 or 18 EUs as well as a new multimedia playback engine that supports hardware-accelerated playback of 4K video from hardware decoding of HEVC and VP9 codecs. The architectural and multimedia-related enhancements of the Apollo Lake SoCs make the LIVA Z quite good for light multimedia and video playback workloads.

The SFF PC will feature up to 8 GB of DDR3L memory (up to two SO-DIMMs), a pre-installed eMMC 32 GB/64 module as well as an M.2-2242 slot for SATA SSDs. There is no place for 2.5” HDDs/SSDs inside the LIVA Z, hence the system supports only solid-state M.2 storage devices. Currently the maximum capacity of available M.2-2242 SATA SSDs is 512 GB (albeit, they are rare), which means that people with vast multimedia libraries will have to use external storage.

Prices will naturally depend on exact SoC, RAM, eMMC configuration as well as on the version of Windows included (or the lack of any OS). Some of the previous-gen ECS LIVA systems started at $170 and $180, so expect the new versions to be in the same range.

By Shawn Knight on Nov 14, 2016, 8:00 PM TechSpot In a move that harkens back to the early days of overclocking, Intel is reportedly preparing to launch a seventh-generation Core i3 “Kaby Lake” desktop processor as an unlocked K-Series variant. Wccftech is reporting that the Intel Core i3-7350K, a dual-core / four threaded processor with a base clock of 4.0GHz (boost up to 4.2GHz), 4MB of L3 cache and a TDP of 91 watts, will ship unlocked and thus, ready to be overclocked. What’s the big deal about an unlocked Core i3 chip, you ask? During the heyday of overclocking when there was a significant performance gap between different processor lines, it was possible to purchase a budget chip like Intel’s Celeron 300A or one of AMD’s Athlon Slot A processors and overclock them by a couple hundred megahertz or so. The first enthusiast processor I purchased, for example, was a 500MHz Slot A Athlon with a 600MHz core (AMD underclocked it to meet demand) that I overclocked to 800MHz using a Golden Fingers device (my actual processor pictured above). I then moved to a 700MHz Slot A chip with a 900MHz core that I pushed to 1GHz. That may not sound like much today but back then, a few hundred megahertz made a huge difference, separating budget CPUs from much more expensive Pentium-branded chips. AMD pulled out of the consumer CPU race years ago which allowed Intel to take its foot off the accelerator of innovation and minimize the performance gain that each new processor generation affords. Worse yet, Intel eventually fought back against overclockers by unlocking all but a handful of their most expensive processors, effectively putting the technique out of hand of budget builders. Intel is expected to unveil its Kaby Lake desktop lineup in the near future.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Intel may add Wi-Fi, USB 3.1 to next-generation chipsets Intel may add Wi-Fi, USB 3.1 to next-generation chipsets By Joel Hruska on November 10, 2016 at 4:46 pm Comment Motherboard chipsets haven’t really changed much in the last few years. There’s been some support for new storage options and standards, like M.2 for SSDs, some limited support for features like Thunderbolt, and faster memory speeds have trickled out over time. Intel might shake things up a bit for its 300-series chipsets in 2017, if rumors are to be believed, with integrated support for Wi-Fi and USB 3.1. Both standards could be useful to consumers and a new report from Digitimes implies Intel is considering the concept. USB 3.1 Gen 2 offers up to 10Gbps of transfer speed, while USB 3.0 (aka USB 3.1 Gen 1) tops out at just 5Gbps. Objectively, there aren’t that many consumers who currently need USB 3.1 Gen 2, but the technology could be useful for secondary displays or high-performance external storage arrays. If Intel integrates Wi-Fi, it would likely use its own radios, which would need to be either shrunk to an equivalent process technology or placed on-package rather than integrated directly into the CPU. The benefits of node shrinks for radios are considerably smaller than what we see in conventional logic. Radios and cellular modems are commonly integrated into mobile SoCs, but to the best of our knowledge Intel has never released hardware with either feature directly integrated on-board. The SoFIA chips that Intel would have built had integrated radios, but these were going to be fabbed at TSMC. The downside to this play is that it could have a significant negative effect on third-party providers like Realtek, Broadcom, and Asmedia who often provide supplemental chips that provide Wi-Fi or USB 3.1 support to Intel and AMD chips. Some need for these designs would still remain, since motherboard companies often use them to add even more port support to high-end boards, but losing mainstream business could still hurt. Asmedia has also contracted with AMD to provide some of its chipset needs, which should lessen the impact — especially if AMD manages a successful launch with Zen. Up until now, Intel’s Wi-Fi solutions have been available via cards like this one. Integrating the feature on-chip or on-package would be an interesting move for the company. As for whether or not these features will drive upgrades, I think the forecast there is a bit mixed. On the one hand, I’d love to have a robust option for Wi-Fi integrated into a desktop, especially if Intel offers a version with an external antenna to improve performance. Even if you prefer wired Internet (and I very much do), we’ve all had scenarios where running a new line for a system was a serious routing headache. Good Wi-Fi support baked in from the get-go would mitigate that problem. Plus, the fastest Wi-Fi solutions are approaching throughput performance that can rival wired Ethernet, especially if you have an older router or switch that only supports 100TX performance between ports. (A number of routers and switches that claim to offer gigabit performance only have one gigabit port — the port that connects to the modem itself.) But whether integrated Wi-Fi is a key feature that’ll spur people to upgrade is something I’m less sure of. Systems last longer and longer these days — I recently took a side-grade to a different motherboard after my existing system developed some USB-specific problems after five years. Just 10 years ago, trying to make do with a Pentium 3 or Athlon from 2000 in 2005 was possible, but not much fun. Today, a five-year-old CPU barely even feels like an issue. That’s not a situation Intel is thrilled with, but it has proven to be a very hard problem to solve. I suspect the big play here, at least in Wi-Fi, is that it allows Intel to ship its own hardware to more customers by expanding the market for Intel wireless solutions. Desktops aren’t a huge market these days, but they still represent a significant sales increase.

With the 960 Pro, Samsung targeted professionals and enthusiasts willing to pay a premium to have the best performance money can buy. With the 960 EVO, Samsung is targeting the mainstream market where affordability is the key ingredient. Samsung's 960 EVO strikes a perfect balance between price and performance. Facilitating the 960 EVO's affordability is Samsung's third-generation V-NAND 3-bit flash. 3-bit flash is much cheaper per gigabyte to produce than 2-bit flash resulting in lower cost to the consumer.     To date, only two TLC-based consumer NVMe SSDs have hit the market; the Intel 600P and now Samsung's 960 EVO. Intel's 600P has become popular with mainstream consumers because it is literally half the cost of current MLC-based NVMe SSDs. Mainstream users, for the most part, are willing to sacrifice some performance for lower cost of ownership. In the case of Intel's 600P, they are willing to sacrifice a ton of performance for lower cost. This is where Samsung sees a golden opportunity for their new 960 EVO. Samsung designed the 960 EVO to deliver massive performance at a super-low price point, giving the mainstream user the best of both worlds.   The key to Samsung's performance advantage is their flash. Samsung's V-NAND 3D flash has proven to be a game changer. Samsung is way ahead of the curve when it comes to NAND flash technology. At this time, we are starting to see competing first generation 3D flash hit the market while Samsung is currently developing their fourth-generation 3D NAND flash.   Samsung's 3-bit EVO series has been massively successful; in fact, it is by far the world's bestselling line of SSDs. We have to look no further than the 850 EVO to see why. The 3-bit V-NAND-powered 850 EVO outperforms all competing TLC and MLC SATA SSDs on the market; doing so with a very low cost per gigabyte. Samsung is looking to perform a similar feat in the NVMe arena with the 960 EVO. The 960 EVO is a bit of a different animal than the 850 EVO because of the NVMe interface.   The SATA-based 850 EVO is, for the most part, just as fast or even faster than the 2-bit 850 Pro. This is because the SATA interface is so restrictive that Samsung's 3-bit V-NAND appears to deliver performance that is just as good as 2-bit V-NAND. This is not the case with the 960 EVO. It is not going to be competing with the 960 Pro in terms of performance. Over the NVMe interface, 2-bit flash clearly delivers better performance than 3-bit.   The 960 EVO and the 960 Pro share a common NVMe controller. "Polaris" is Samsung's second-generation NVMe controller. Samsung's Polaris NVMe controller is a 5-core design that replaces the 3-core UBX controller found on the 950 Pro. The additional channels along with architectural improvements make Polaris the best performing consumer NVMe controller ever released. Polaris dedicates four cores to the NAND array, and one core is dedicated to optimizing the communication between the host and controller. To maximize the 960 EVO's 3-bit MLC performance, Samsung employs two types NAND flash; 128Gb 3-bit V-NAND for the 250GB model and 256Gb 3-bit V-NAND for the 500GB and 1TB models.   In terms of read/write performance, the 960 EVO is second only to the 960 Pro. At similar capacity points, the 960 EVO outperforms the potent 950 Pro by as much as 45% when reading sequential data and by as much as 67% when writing sequential data. Additionally, 4K random performance is up by as much as 200% comparatively. To get burst performance this good with 3-bit flash, Samsung has developed caching technology called "Intelligent TurboWrite." Intelligent TurboWrite is a more refined version of the TurboWrite technology found on the 850 EVO. Intelligent TurboWrite dedicates a portion of the drive's flash array as an SLC buffer layer. Intelligent TurboWrite identifies user workloads intelligently and defines the appropriate SLC buffer. Samsung's Intelligent TurboWrite has a default and dynamic size that breaks down as follows.     TurboWrite makes it possible for the 960 EVO to reach sequential read/write speeds of up to 3200/1900 MB/s and random read/write performance of up to 380,000/360,000 IOPS.   Like the 950/960 Pro, the 960 EVO is a single-sided M.2 22mm x 80mm design. A 2280 single-sided design is most desirable because it will fit into just about any laptop on the market with an M.2 PCIe slot. Additionally, a single-sided design is easier to cool. To further assist heat dissipation under load, Samsung has developed an innovative heat-dissipating label that extends peak data transferability by over 60% in comparison to the 950 Pro. Samsung's unique four-layer heat dissipating label has a thin copper layer that helps to shed heat faster than would be possible without the label.   To compliment the 960 Series SSDs, Samsung is introducing a new 2.0 version of their proprietary NVMe driver. Samsung's new NVMe driver 2.0 is designed to ensure full compatibility and maximum performance for 960 users. We will be utilizing Samsung's new NVMe 2.0 driver for most of our testing. Samsung has also revamped their Magician software. The new version of Magician offers a more personalized, intuitive interface along with host of new features. Unfortunately, we do not have the new version in-hand, so we will have to show you the new interface and features when we can do so.     Specifications     Samsung's 960 EVO M.2 x 2280 NVMe SSD is available in three capacities: 250GB, 500GB, and 1TB.   Sequential Read: up to 3,200 MB/s Sequential Write: up to 1,900 MB/s Max 4K Random Read Speed: up to 380,000 IOPS Max 4K Random Write Speed: up to 360,000 IOPS Max 4K QD1 Random Read Speed: up to 14,000 IOPS Max 4K QD1 Random Write Speed: up to 50,000 IOPS Endurance: up to 400 TBW MTTF: 1.5 Million Hours Warranty: 3-Year Limited Warranty Active Power Consumption: 4.4-5.7W Avg.

NEW YORK-- November 15, 2016 --Packet, the leading bare metal cloud for developers, today announced a new ARM®v8-A based on-demand server configuration, available to deploy in less than ten minutes from its data centers in Parsippany (NJ), Sunnyvale (CA), Amsterdam (NL) and Tokyo (JP). The ARMv8-A option - powered by a pair of 48-core Cavium (NASDAQ: CAVM) ThunderX chips - makes Packet the first cloud provider to offer a 64-bit ARM server with the same elastic benefits of Intel-powered solutions. The 2A server is priced at $0.50/hr, or $0.005/core per hour (about 1/10th the cost per core of Packet’s existing Intel-powered Type 2) and is available in minutes via API, portal or widely used DevOps tools such as Terraform and Ansible. “Making a powerful, low-cost ARM compute node available to developers has been a dream of mine for years,” said Zachary Smith, CEO at Packet. “With the support of the Cavium and SoftBank teams, as well as our hardware and ecosystem partners, we’re thrilled that users can take advantage of ARMv8-A powered bare metal at this incredible price point with the same experience as our x86 solutions.” Unlike lower-end ARMv7-A variants, the ARMv8-A architecture powering Packet’s bare metal Type 2A is designed for high density data center workloads and thrives on tasks like container-based applications, data processing, threaded application workloads and network heavy functions such as load balancing. To encourage rapid adoption, Packet also announced full 64-bit ARM support for Ubuntu 16.04, as well as a pipeline that includes CoreOS, FreeBSD and CentOS. “Packet is enabling genuine choice in the data center market with an instantly available ARMv8-A 64-bit server solution that is a direct challenger to legacy providers,” said Jeff Underhill, director of server programs, ARM. “The combination of outstanding performance at a compelling price is bolstered by Packet’s access to a wide range of developer networks anxious to test their workloads on ARM processor-based servers.” Cloud native (Docker, Kubernetes, Mesos) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are natural workloads for ARMv8-A as they are highly portable and do not require the same tie-in with Intel processors. Packet’s offering follows a recent investment by SoftBank, who acquired ARM Holdings for $32 billion in September. “Packet brought the public cloud experience to single tenant bare metal,” said Rishi Chugh, Director Marketing, Data Center Processor Group at Cavium. “The ARM-based high density server platform, built on Cavium’s award-winning workload optimized ThunderX processor, further accelerates the enablement of next generation cloud applications that power the modern internet and technology of tomorrow.” About Packet Founded in 2014, Packet’s proprietary technology automates physical servers and networks without the use of virtualization or multi-tenancy to provide on-demand compute and connectivity. Customers can either build on Packet’s public cloud service or leverage advanced automation software to enable their own private compute infrastructure. The company is headquartered in New York City and maintains an advanced global IP network between its data center locations in New York Metro (Parsippany, NJ), Sunnyvale (CA), Amsterdam (NL) and Tokyo (JP). Packet is a member of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and supports many open source projects, including Memcached.org, which uses Packet to perform automatic performance and burn-in testing of new features.     Contact Packet Architects AB Fill out this form for contacting a Packet Architects AB representative.

Macs & Mac OS X | 03 Nov 2016 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (58) Explaining Thunderbolt 3, USB-C, and Everything In Between by Glenn Fleishman The first Mac with Thunderbolt 3 is now available, the non-Touch Bar 13-inch model from Apple’s new series of MacBook Pro laptops (see “New MacBook Pros Add Context-sensitive Touch Bar,” 27 October 2016); the rest of the models ship soon. Thunderbolt 3 relies on the USB-C physical connector and, with the appropriate adapters, supports nearly all common peripheral-connection and networking protocols, including USB 2, USB 3, FireWire, Thunderbolt 2, Ethernet, and DisplayPort, and by extension, HDMI, DVI, and VGA. The reason confusion afflicts this space is that a USB-C port on another computer may support just USB, USB plus display and networking protocols, or all of that plus Thunderbolt 3. The 12-inch MacBook’s USB-C port, for instance, natively supports USB 2 and USB 3 along with DisplayPort and, via adapters, VGA, HDMI, and Ethernet connections, but not Thunderbolt 2 or FireWire. The summary for potential late 2016 MacBook Pro owners is that all current USB-C devices, cables, and adapters should work when plugged into a MacBook Pro’s Thunderbolt 3 ports. However, Thunderbolt 3-specific devices won’t work with computers and other devices like the 12-inch MacBook whose USB-C ports are less capable. Now, let’s drill down into details. How These Standards Relate to Each Other -- USB-C is a standard developed by the USB Implementors Forum to modernize and coalesce USB into a single plug style that supports a variety of data, video, and power options for ports, cables, and adapters. It’s reversible, just like the Lightning plug Apple uses for iOS devices and recent peripherals like the Apple Pencil and Magic Mouse 2. Support for high-wattage and high-amperage cables allows USB-C chargers to charge laptops and other devices. While previous versions of USB allowed for high power flow, USB-C is the first version in which laptops take advantage of that, allowing external charging from an AC adapter or external battery. USB-C also offers bidirectional power, so a MacBook Pro could recharge itself via an external battery while also charging an iPhone. (Although we’re focusing here on USB-C, or more formally, USB Type-C, USB also supports other plug types. These include USB Type-A, the standard rectangular USB plug we’re all accustomed to; USB Type-B, the squarish USB plug often used by large peripherals; and the smaller Mini-A, Mini-B, Micro-A, Micro-B, and Micro-B SuperSpeed plugs.) USB-C appeared first in 2015 in the 12-inch MacBook, and shortly thereafter in equipment from Google and others. It has spread gradually, but it is still not the connection of choice for laptops and mobile phones. The third-party peripheral market, especially for docks and high-quality cables, started to accelerate only in early 2016. Thunderbolt 1 and 2 use the same physical connector as Mini DisplayPort, which allowed a jack to fit easily into a thin laptop. Natively, they support two protocols: Thunderbolt (originally built on top of PCI Express) for general data and DisplayPort for video. With adapters, they can also carry USB, FireWire, and Ethernet. Although Intel developed Thunderbolt jointly with Apple, Intel seems to control its future. In June 2015, Intel and the USB Implementors Forum announced that Thunderbolt 3 would rely on the USB-C plug style. That was good news: one fewer cable type and all ports would become multi-purpose! How this works has to do with abstraction: the hardware no longer defines a single associated communications protocol. USB-C and DisplayPort exist both as a physical specification for connectors and cables, and also as a logical protocol that defines how data moves across a data bus. The USB-C data bus has a number of channels (called “lanes”) that can be assigned and configured to different protocols, depending on the USB-C controller hardware in the host computer or other device, including USB, DisplayPort, PCI Express, and Thunderbolt. DisplayPort can either use its own connector type or be encapsulated and carried by other standards, which include USB-C, whether or not the controller hardware supports Thunderbolt. This capability of DisplayPort made it possible for Thunderbolt to use the Mini DisplayPort connector type and be backward compatible with existing DisplayPort devices. Thunderbolt allows daisy chaining — plugging one peripheral into the next — though DisplayPort monitors have to be at the end of such a chain. Though I can’t find a definitive answer, it appears that you cannot daisy chain USB devices connected via USB-C, although you can simulate daisy chaining with the addition of USB-C–connected hubs. Power, which is effectively a different kind of protocol in USB-C, can be passed through multiple devices. When it comes to protocols, USB-C natively supports: USB 2.0 (480 Mbps) USB 3.0 (5 Gbps, branded SuperSpeed, now described as USB 3.1 Gen 1) USB 3.1 Gen 2 (10 Gbps, branded SuperSpeed+, which requires USB-C as a connector type) DisplayPort (under the ungainly name “DisplayPort Alternate Mode on USB Type-C Connector Standard”) MHL 3.0 (Mobile High-Definition Link, which you’ve probably never heard of: it’s a way to connect mobile devices to HD displays) Thunderbolt 3 (on computers that have Thunderbolt 3 controllers, like the new MacBook Pros) USB-C can create the appropriate electrical signals for these natively supported standards internally and pass them through a cable with a USB-C plug on one end and the native format, like DisplayPort or USB 3 Type-A, on the other. Some of these are in the form of a dongle with a jack on the non-USB-C end, but it’s still sending the signal straight through. For other protocols, you need an adapter, which performs internal signal conversion between USB-C and the adapter’s input port, like HDMI, VGA, Ethernet, and FireWire. (The HDMI trade group added USB-C as an option recently and says that monitors with native USB-C support will be out in 2017. For now, Ethernet is supported directly only in a 10 Gbps peer-to-peer version that’s part of Thunderbolt 3.) USB-C can drive at least a single 4K monitor, depending on the display circuitry on the host device. A computer with Multi-Stream Transport (MST) can drive two displays from a single USB-C port. Apple built MST into some Macs, but the 12-inch MacBook lacks it, and thus can only handle one external monitor. Thunderbolt 3 has more robust display support, enabling it to use higher refresh rates and manage significantly more pixels overall. Thunderbolt 3 cables are labeled with the same lightning logo used by Thunderbolt 2 cables, while USB cables with USB-C connectors show the familiar USB logo and may also be branded with SS+ for SuperSpeed+. Older USB 3.0 (also known as USB 3.1 Gen 1) cables are sometimes also branded with an SS for SuperSpeed. Happily, Thunderbolt 3, as supported by the new MacBook Pros, supports all the protocols handled by USB-C, plus Thunderbolt and FireWire. The end result is that nearly any device can be plugged into a Thunderbolt 3 port, with the correct cable, adapter, or dock, as I explain next. (What kinds of ports are you using with a Mac laptop? You can fill out my survey and see the current results.) Adapt or Die! -- There’s both some FUD and reasonable caution about USB-C cables and adapters. Quality gear comes from the likes of Apple, Belkin, Google, and Kensington, although Apple’s products have historically been quite expensive. Apple recently cut prices of all its USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 accessories through 31 December 2016; see “Responding to Complaints, Apple Drops Adapter and Monitor Prices” (4 November 2016). You can often find less expensive gear made cheaply by little-known manufacturers and sold via Amazon (see “Be Careful When Buying Apple Accessories on Amazon,” 24 October 2016). Before buying from unfamiliar brands, I recommend that you consult Google engineer Benson Leung’s Amazon reviews, whether or not you make the purchase via Amazon. He has extensively tested cables, adapters, and other equipment in his personal time, and he can steer you towards and away from USB-C products. Let’s assume you have or are planning to get a new MacBook Pro with Thunderbolt 3. Here’s a rundown of what you’ll need for each of the various connection types: USB: For connecting older USB peripherals, you’ll need a USB-C adapter, cable, or dock. Existing products will work fine with the MacBook Pro models. If you want the simplest one-to-one converter, pick up a USB-C to USB Type-A adapter — or several. Apple’s adapter is $9; well-reviewed adapters on Amazon cost a couple bucks less. My favorite dock is currently the Satechi Aluminum Multi-Port Type C Adapter, which I gave top marks to in a review at Macworld. It offers a 4K display output (via HDMI, compatible with DisplayPort), two USB 3.0 Type-A ports, and pass-through power. It held up well in testing, and it’s an attractive, compact unit. Lightning: If you want to charge a Lightning-equipped device without using an adapter or dock, you can get Apple’s USB-C to Lightning cable, available in 3.3 foot/1 meter ($19) and 6.6 feet/2 meters ($29) versions. Ethernet: To add gigabit Ethernet, which many people prefer over Wi-Fi when it’s available at a home or business office, you have plenty of options with USB-C now. Don’t overpay: the $17 Kanex adapter fits the bill. Like many USB to Ethernet adapters, it requires a free driver for the Mac. (Thunderbolt 3 uses the 10 Gbps Ethernet specification for peer-to-peer transfers between two computers using a Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 3 cable.) FireWire: If you have older equipment that supports FireWire 400 or 800 as its only or fastest communications method, you may need to wait to see what materializes. There’s no direct adapter or cable available. Apple’s FireWire 800 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter would then have to pass through a Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter (see below), a combination that hasn’t yet been tested for reliability, but which Apple says is supported. Some Thunderbolt 2 docks include FireWire ports, and an updated version of one of those could be the right path. Thunderbolt: Because Thunderbolt 3 is backward compatible with the previous version, Thunderbolt 2 docks should work fine. It’s possible there could be incompatibilities with certain chips or features, so you may want to wait for others to test and report on them. Roman Loyola at Macworld rounded up the best Thunderbolt 2 docks in December 2015. Docks will require a Thunderbolt 2 to 3 adapter ($29). Unfortunately, that adapter doesn’t allow for connections to Mini DisplayPort displays like Apple’s older Cinema Displays, although it should work with the 27-inch Thunderbolt Display. By the way, Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 3 cables are currently a little pricey: Apple is selling two Belkin cables: $22 for 0.5 meters (1.6 feet) and $52 for 2 meters (6.6 feet). Belkin has announced a Thunderbolt 3 dock too. The Thunderbolt 3 Express Dock HD is a refresh of a previous version that cost about $250. It will sport pass-through power (up to 85 watts, enough for any MacBook Pro model), two Thunderbolt 3 ports, one full-size DisplayPort jack, gigabit Ethernet, two analog audio jacks, and three USB Type-A 3.0 ports. It can handle two monitors, each up to 4K, by using one Thunderbolt 3 port and the DisplayPort connection. A lot more Thunderbolt 3 docks are coming. For more details on other adapters and cables, consult Roman Loyola’s recently posted Thunderbolt 3 adapter guide at Macworld. Displays: On the monitor side of the equation, you should be able to use all displays, up to 4K resolution, that support DisplayPort 1.2 or later. You’ll need a USB-C to DisplayPort adapter or cable. An increasing number of monitors offer DisplayPort over USB-C as an option — sometimes the only option (see, for instance, “Acer H277HU USB-C Display Is an Affordable MacBook Companion,” 11 April 2016). However, 5K displays will need native Thunderbolt 3 support, as with the new LG 5K monitor Apple showed off in its keynote and which it will be selling in Apple Stores. Apple just dropped the price on its previously expensive USB-C multiport adapters, both of which offer video out, along with a USB-C power-only port for passthrough charging and a USB Type-A port. The Digital AV Multiport Adapter with HDMI and the VGA Multiport Adapter are both $49, at least through the end of 2016, after which the price may return to $69. You can also get a variety of USB-C to DVI adapters from other parties, though we don’t have a particular recommendation. The 13-inch MacBook Pro models have built-in video support for one 5K display or two 4K displays. The 15-inch models can handle two 5K displays and a whopping four 4K displays. That’s because the 13-inch models have one USB-C controller and a perfectly fine video system; the 15-inch models include two USB-C controllers and much better display circuitry. Real-World Scenarios -- Now that you know what the adapter options are, how do you apply them? There are two notable scenarios: moving data to a new MacBook Pro via the Setup Assistant or Migration Assistant, and working with Target Disk Mode. Apple has published a support page explaining the possibilities for migrating data to a 12-inch MacBook or late-2016 MacBook Pro; also be sure to read “How to Migrate to a New Mac” (14 September 2016). Depending on the Macs in question, Apple suggests a few choices: Wi-Fi: Apple suggests that Wi-Fi is the simplest method, but it’s by far the slowest, and in our experience, it often fails in the middle. We recommend Wi-Fi as the last-ditch method. From a backup drive: If you have a backup of your previous Mac, either a bootable duplicate or a Time Machine backup, you can attach that drive to the new MacBook Pro via USB-C. Ethernet: With a USB-C to Ethernet adapter for the new MacBook Pro, and another adapter for the older Mac if necessary, Setup/Migration Assistant can transfer your data over a standard Ethernet cable. USB-C: If you’re migrating from a 12-inch MacBook to a new MacBook Pro, a USB-C to USB-C cable will work. Not all such cables have full data transfer capabilities, so make sure to get one that does, such as this one from Belkin. Target Disk Mode, a way to turn one Mac into a bootable drive for another Mac, is a somewhat different situation. Apple has updated its Target Disk Mode page to include a mention of Thunderbolt 3. Apple is light on the specifics but seems to imply that you will need two matching ports and a cable to connect them. From this reading, only the 12-inch MacBook and the new MacBook Pros will be able to employ Target Disk Mode between themselves, using either a USB-only USB-C cable or a Thunderbolt 3 cable. However, Target Disk Mode also reportedly worked with a Thunderbolt 2-to-FireWire adapter, so that combination may also work with an additional Thunderbolt 2-to-3 adapter, but we haven’t yet seen confirmation. USB-Cing Stars -- This may all seem confusing initially, but it should pass quickly because everything on the market for USB and DisplayPort over USB-C today should work with Thunderbolt 3. The main group that will be disappointed are those who buy Thunderbolt 3 peripherals and expect them to work with a 12-inch MacBook, which doesn’t extend USB-C support to Thunderbolt. We can hope that Apple makes Thunderbolt 3 standard across the entire Mac line. I anticipate that, now that Thunderbolt 3 is out and available in a mainstream Mac, other manufacturers will ship more new high-end computers with Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C. USB 3.1 Gen 2 tops out at 10 Gbps, which will be fine for lower-end systems, which don’t require 40 Gbps performance and aren’t intended to support more than two displays. Mobile devices outside of the Apple ecosystem will stick with and continue to adopt USB-C without Thunderbolt 3 for simplicity, power consumption, and controller cost. With nothing else like either USB 3.1 Gen 2 or Thunderbolt 3 on the horizon and the broad industry support of the USB-C connector, USB is finally living up to the Universal part of its name — even when Thunderbolt is thrown in on top.   TextExpander: Your knowledge at your fingertips.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Simon   2016-11-04 00:48 Very useful guide. Thanks, Glenn. You mention USB-C to DisplayPort cables. What about HDMI? Are there or will there be such cables, or do I need to resort to Apple's "Digital AV Multiport Adapter"? (assuming I don't have a TB3 dock with built-in HDMI) For Ethernet adapters I prefer Apple's so I don't have to worry about 3rd party drivers. But Apple so far only offers TB2 to Gigabit. Would that work in combination with a TB2 to TB3 dongle? Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-04 01:28 Lots of USB-C to HDMI adapter/dongle options. Google has one even. And it's a standard feature of most docks. As for Ethernet, I've found some that require a driver for full functionality (wake from sleep) and others that require a driver to work at all. I'd definitely read reviews for USB-C to Ethernet adapters, and see what other Mac owners say. Reply Peter  2016-11-04 12:36 Plugable has stated their USB-C to HDMI adapter behaves inconsistently--this is apparently unrelated to the Thunderbolt 3 chipset compatibility issue (http://plugable.com/2016/10/27/the-new-2016-macbook-pros-plugables-thunderbolt-3-and-usb-c-products/). I wonder if similar HDMI adapters from StarTech or Monoprice will have issues. Reply Simon   2016-11-08 05:40 Thanks to another kind poster I was pointed to this support ducument: https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT207266 It clearly mentions the Gigabit-TB2 adapter can be used on a new MBP in conjunction with Apple's new TB3-TB2 dongle. Reply bitguru  2016-11-04 16:31 There were strong rumors at the time that the type-C connector was actually developed by Apple and given away so that it would be adopted widely for USB and Thunderbolt. Were these ever confirmed or debunked? Reply Daniel Compton  2016-11-07 16:03 Unfortunately, it looks like not all Thunderbolt 3 devices will work with the new Macbook Pro, adding more confusion to this situation: https://9to5mac.com/2016/11/03/2016-macbook-pro-thunderbolt-compatibility-issues/. Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-07 16:06 We’re waiting for some more clarity about that. Apple hasn’t offered comment, and it’s a single vendor. I would expect to hear from Intel and Texas Instruments, too. We’ll provide more detail when we feel there’s more to go on. Reply Mark  2016-11-07 16:17 Will daisychaining monitors work over USB C? The 4K LG monitor just has a few USB C ports, and Apple says they are only 2.0 for some reason. What I'd like to do is connect my 1080p monitor to one of these using a DisplayPort to USB c cable to preserve the one cable with Power to the MBP. So: 1080p DisplayPort-->USB c 4K-->2016 MBP. Apple support said this was possible but I don't believe them given that daisychaining only works with TB on the Mac, and the 2.0 specifications on the USB Ports. But maybe because this is Apple sanctioned they made it work. Edit: you do say this: "Though I can’t find a definitive answer, it appears that you cannot daisy chain USB devices connected via USB-C, although you can simulate daisy chaining with the addition of USB-C–connected hubs. " So if I'm understanding this right, I'd need a USB c dock in the middle? Would the monitor be able to pass power through it to the MBP? Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-07 16:24 My understanding is that works only with Thunderbolt 3 monitors, not USB-C ones. USB-C, from what I can tell, does not support daisy chaining, only hubs. The LG monitor uses so many USB-C "lanes" for 4K DisplayPort that it lacks enough lanes to offer USB 3, thus drops to USB 2 (480 Mbps), which requires fewer lanes. A Thunderbolt 3 monitor can daisy chain both because the spec supports it and Thunderbolt 3 has enough raw throughput to pass through enough DisplayPort signal. But USB-based USB-C monitors can’t. Conceivably, a non Thunderbolt 3 monitor could pass through a signal (by acting as a hub of sorts), but the monitor resolution for each connected display would have to be half of 4K (about 1080p or so), and the Mac model would have to support MST, described in the article, which the 12-inch MacBook does not, and the new MacBook Pros don't require as such. Reply Mark  2016-11-07 16:49 So would a cheap USB C dock in the middle fix this? I'll be docking this laptop every day and want a one-cable solution. If I am forced to buy an expensive TB3 dock anyway, then I'd rather get a cheaper 4K monitor. Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-08 11:30 Yes. I've tested USB-C docks with a 12-inch MacBook where you can have a 4K display and get USB 3.1 Gen 1 (5 Gbps) throughput on the USB ports. Reply Mark  2016-11-08 13:21 Do you have links? All I can find are docks that are limited to 30 Hz. The caldigit can do it with a firmware upgrade but then your USB ports become 2.0. Reply Andrew  2016-11-07 16:38 Is there a difference between a USB-C to USB-C cable and a Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 3 cable? I know physically they would appear the same but would they both be capable of transmitting at the same data rate given identical host and peripheral? Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-07 16:47 They will be different electrically and functionally, made to different specifications. Also, every USB-C cable will have a tiny computer in the connector end that negotiates details with the port's controller. A USB-C cable designed for USB data will work with Thunderbolt 3, even between Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 3 ports, but the controller will recognize it can only handle USB 2 or USB 3. A Thunderbolt 3 cable should work with a USB-only port or ports, but will max out at USB 3 speeds (or whatever the controller wants). USB-only USB-C cables will be marked with a USB logo as noted in the article. Thunderbolt 3 cables will have a lightning bolt icon and a tiny 3. Reply Peter  2016-11-07 20:25 There are also "active" and "passive" versions of TB3 cables. The latter max out at 20gbps while the former can utilize the full 40gbps rate of TB3. Right now it seems that the active cables are only available in 0.5m lengths but that will change. The passive cables are available up to 2m. Reply John  2016-11-07 17:45 I can verify that Target Disk Mode does work over Thunderbolt 2 to Firewire adapters. We used it to image 2011 Mac Pros to 2013 Mac Pros. Reply Jim Vance  2016-11-07 18:48 What does "but not vice versa" mean in this context? Re-writing or adding a clarifying note would be most welcome. Thanks. Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-07 19:05 I don't see that phrase in this article, so I'm not sure to what you're referring? Reply Jim Vance  2016-11-08 16:12 Sorry, this phrase is in the summary of the article that one sees on the tidbits home page.

It helps me a lot. My very thanks! Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2016-11-07 20:09 Glenn, OWC has a new Thunderbolt 3 Dock available for pre-order: https://eshop.macsales.com/preorder/owc-thunderbolt-3-dock/ It has a FW800 port, SD card reader, mini DisplayPort, 5 USB-A 3.1 Gen 1 ports, etc. Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-07 21:44 This article isn't exhaustive—there will soon be way too many things to list. So we are unlikely to update it to add more options, but will probably write more about different angles, like docks, etc. Reply Michael Paine  2016-11-08 01:15 Satechi are about to release a USB-C adapter packed with more ports: https://www.amazon.com/Satechi-Aluminum-Multi-Port-Adapter-Ethernet/dp/B01FWT7MEA/ref=pd_sim_107_1/151-9551496-6486460?ie=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=FJP9074YB6JG8SJ36AS1 EThernet, HDMI, SD cards, USB3 & USB-C pass-through Reply Michael Paine  2016-11-14 22:18 Received my Satechi "Multi-port" adapter today - fast postage from USA! Most things seems to work well: HDMI, USB, ethernet... The Macbook connects to internet via ethernet and I can access a Time Capsule HD but, strangely, Network Diagnostics report a local network error. Only disappointment is that my iPad won't charge (it will with the Apple HDMI adapter). It should be great for travel and also as a dock for the office (just one cable to plug into the Macboook to connect internet, USB, HDMI and power). Reply Simon   2016-11-15 00:00 This is one of my main gripes with USB. The power rating always seems to be hit and miss. And of course it doesn't help that hardly a hardware manufacturer openly states what power each and every port can deliver. The MBP's USB-C obviously offers enough juice to charge the iPad. So my guess is that the USB-A ports on the Satechi do not pass through the full 2 Amps (or similar) that USB-A can. Bummer. It would be interesting to see if you can at least charge the iPad if you hook it up to the Satechi's USB-C through a Lightning-to-USB-C cable. Reply Michael Paine  2016-11-15 02:43 At least my iPhone charges OK. That is my main travel requirement. Not sure what you mean about Lighting-to-USB-c cable. Reply Simon   2016-11-15 03:03 http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK0X2AM/A/usb-c-to-lightning-cable-1-m Reply Michael Paine  2016-11-15 20:10 Also the SD slot & micro SD slot are handy. They turn the adapter into a memory stick. Reply Wibbly  2016-11-08 03:47 Apple has a support document that provides details on which adapters can be connected together to provide which protocols. In particular, I had a need for Firewire and the note says you can chain the Thunderbolt3-Thunderbolt2 adapter and then add the Thunderbolt2-Firewire adapter Here is the document: https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT207266 Reply Marc  2016-11-08 04:42 Could you please add information about the HDMI 4K adapters whether they support 60Hz (good) or only 30Hz (toy)? The Satechi adapter can only support 30Hz, which makes it a no-go option for me. Since TVs are way more affordable than monitors, people which do not want ultra-sharp displays like the new LG 5K 27" and 4K 21" but more screen space might want to connect one or two 40" curved 4K TVs via HDMI 2.0 as computer displays and show unscaled 3840 pixels (I currently type this on a LG 34" ultrawide 21:9 monitor with 3440*1440 px, unscaled, which is already 2 years old, and of course I want MORE space on my next monitor...). Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-08 11:47 It depends on the controller. The 12-inch MacBook only supports 4K at up to 30 Hz (and only 3840 by 2160). The MBP models support 4K (4096 by 2304) and 5K at up to 60 Hz. We'll be writing follow-up articles; this piece would get ungainly if we kept adding to it. Reply Marc  2016-11-09 01:35 Right - the MacBook 12" is no Pro, and has weak graphics. It supports only a single external 4K display with 30Hz. But the Pro line supports 60Hz (13" max two displays, 15" up to four 4K displays), so please check all HDMI adapters for that. Thx Reply rolf786  2016-11-08 06:06 Could Apple (or someone) make a Magsafe to USB-C charging adapter dongle, similar to the Magsafe 1 to Magsafe 2 adapter they did? That way you could make use of your spare laptop charges AND you'd still get protection against tripping over your charging cable. Reply Adam Engst   2016-11-08 10:27 Griffin Technology has one, but it still sticks out of the Mac, so it's not quite the same thing: https://griffintechnology.com/us/breaksafe-magnetic-usb-c-power-cable Reply rolf786  2016-11-15 03:19 Griffin have their own adapter format (and reviews say it's not that nice as magsafe). I was thinking specifically of a Magsafe-compatible dongle (I have quite an investment in Apple laptop chargers!) but I wasn't sure if the voltage/current it provides is compatible with USB C charging. Reply Michael Brown  2016-11-08 08:43 "...Thunderbolt 2 to 3 adapter ($29). Unfortunately, that adapter doesn’t allow for connections to Mini DisplayPort displays like Apple’s older Cinema Displays" Wait what? So I won't be able to plug my Dell display into a TB 2 to 3 adapter via a mini Display Port cable? That's what I got it for :-( Reply Simon   2016-11-08 09:04 It will still work, just with a cable instead of a dongle. If you take a USB-C/TB3 to (m)DP cable you should be fine. Here's an example. https://www.amazon.com/Plugable-DisplayPort-Chromebook-Thunderbolt-3840x2160/dp/B01EXKDRAC/ Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-08 11:48 Exactly. DisplayPort is native to USB-C and part of Thunderbolt 3 (for higher resolutions). So you don't need to use a Thunderbolt 2 to 3 converter at all. You can use a dock or a cable or an adapter, and plug from USB-C directly to a DisplayPort or HDMI connection. Reply Michael Brown  2016-11-08 15:08 As I already have a Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter I was hoping to kill 2 birds with one stone with the TB 3 to 2 adapter, allowing me to use my old TB to Ethernet *and* for hooking up my external display (not at the same time of course). Looks like I'll have to get a USB-C to DP cable / adapter then :-( Reply Rich  2016-11-10 15:01 Do you know if it's possible to connect the old Apple Cinema Display (ACD) to a 2016 MacBook Pro? The ACD has a built-in cable with a male mini DisplayPort at the end. Would a female-to-female DisplayPort adaptor and a Thunderbolt 3/USB-C to male mini DisplayPort cable work? Or does this adapter actually support the ACD: https://www.amazon.com/USB-C-DisplayPort-Adapter-Aluminium-Macbook/dp/B00ZU1TXHA The Amazon reviews are mixed and it's USB-C rather than Thunderbolt so who knows what it supports?! Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-10 15:09 It's a tricky question. We know that the Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter doesn't work with DisplayPort. We know that DisplayPort is native to USB-C and by extension to Thunderbolt 3. We know that full-sized DisplayPort to USB-C and HDMI to USB-C adapters and docks work! But there's apparently something funny with the Apple Cinema Display. I reviewed a dock at Macworld by the folks at Nonda with explicit ACD support, and they said because of chip issues, they could only support the 2015 MacBook (not the 2016) and only the ACD (not the Apple Thunderbolt Display). They were stymied. http://www.macworld.com/article/3131627/macbook-accessories/nonda-hub-mini-review.html Any USB-C adapter will work with a Thunderbolt 3 system, though, through backwards compatibility. So if it worked with USB-C that lacks Thunderbolt 3 it'll work with Thunderbolt 3 as well. Reply Josh   2016-11-08 10:38 Thanks Glenn, this is great and an awesome roadmap. One thing that I may have missed is will this work with the original USB 1. As a photographer I have stashes of old hard drives and a Zip drive stored away. I've moved them all to larger drives but keep the old as backups. I can see a day where those are no longer accessible and it may be today with USB C. Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-08 11:49 USB 1 has largely been abandoned, so I'd recommend making additional copies, maybe writing to permanent discs and sticking in a safe-deposit vault. Zip disks are only rated to last a few years, so they may have degraded beyond readable point, in any case. Old hard drives magnetic properties degrade over time, too. Reply Michael Paine  2016-11-09 15:43 I use 25Gb bluray disks for long-term backup of crucial data. I realise typical photo libraries now exceed this capacity but the really important stuff should fit. Unlike DVD and CD (and magnetic media, and SSD!) Bluray is designed to last for decades. The biggest problem may be finding a Bluray drive in 2030! Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-09 15:50 Good plan! Although 1 TB SSD with a USB 3 interface might be a good investment when it gets cheap enough. Treat your USB 1 and Zip drives as quaint artifacts, rather than backups. Reply emma  2016-11-11 09:45 Apple sells a multi AV adapter to connect the new MacBook Pro to HDMI monitors, but I wonder if it would also allow an Apple TV to connect to a Thunderbolt 3 monitor. Is it possible to connect devices with HDMI out (Apple TV, PlayStation 4) to Thunderbolt 3 monitors (LG UltraFine 4k/5k) with a (combination) of cables or dongles? I thought it might work if the monitor supports "DisplayPort Alternate Mode on USB Type-C Connector Standard", _and_ you buy an active (and relatively expensive) HDMI to DisplayPort adapter, and chain the DisplayPort to USB-C Thunderbolt 3 somehow. However, is DisplayPort Alternate Mode on USB Type-C something that an input such as a monitor can accept or is it only an option if the output (e.g. a MacBook Pro) supports it? I'd be interested in a Thunderbolt 3 monitor if it could be used for more than only the new MacBook Pro. This article mentions that only the LG 5k monitor requires Thunderbolt 3 sources. Does that mean it might work with the 4k monitor? Reply Curtis Wilcox   2016-11-11 10:41 As you've found, HDMI - DisplayPort adapters are not bidirectional. Adapting a DisplayPort source to an HDMI display requires a cheap and relatively simple adapter but adapting an HDMI source to a DisplayPort display requires expensive, complex hardware. My hunch is once you've converted to some kind of DisplayPort, converting it further to DisplayPort Alternate Mode on USB-C is feasible. The LG 4K monitor is not a Thunderbolt 3 device so it's more likely to work. I think it's better to wait and see what other products come along, a 4K monitor with both USB-C and HDMI interfaces would be much simpler to work with. Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-11 13:03 What Curtis said! Thanks for providing all that detail. Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-11 13:06 A monitor that only features a USB-C connection (either built in or a connector into which to plug a cable) will only work over USB-C. A monitor with Thunderbolt 3 as its only connection method (such as the 5K) will only work with Thunderbolt 3. However, we're like to see monitors that offer DisplayPort, HDMI, and USB-C, as there's no real reason not to—all three standards can support 4K, and it lets a monitor maker sell to a broader audience. Internally, I don't think very much more circuitry is needed, because it's all effectively DisplayPort just being routed out of a controller. Reply Bruno  2016-11-12 10:11 How much bandwidth does it take to drive a 4K display at 60Hz? Could there be a hypothetical USB-c hub that connects to a single MBP USB-c/TB3 port and drives two 4K at 60 Hz + 1Gpbs Ethernet + a couple of USB-3.1 ports, simultaneously? Reply Curtis Wilcox   2016-11-12 15:05 A single UHD@60Hz* display is effectively 17.28 Gbit/s but it's not like the connector has a bandwidth budget that's partially consumed by video and by other devices using USB, it's more complex than that. The announced OWC *Thunderbolt 3* dock can do all that. https://www.owcdigital.com/products/thunderbolt/thunderbolt-3-dock-overview However when the source port is a USB-C connector that does not support Thunderbolt 3, only USB 3.1, I expect the options are more limited. The video is separated from the USB-ness, it's DisplayPort Alternate Mode. DisplayPort 1.2 introduced "Multi-Stream Transport" (MST) which allows daisy-chaining monitors or having a hub. However, DisplayPort 1.2 can't be used for 2 4K/UHD displays and no Mac supports 1.3 yet. As Glenn wrote, the 12-inch MacBook doesn't support MST. Apple will probably stick with Thunderbolt 3 so what USB 3.1 supports won't matter to them but at least some PC manufacturers probably won't adopt Thunderbolt 3 and we'll see what docks and display hubs they come up with. Dell already made the D3100 which supports 1 UHD and 2 Full HD monitors on a single USB connection. * Often when people say "4K" they really mean UHD; UHD is 4 times more pixels than Full HD, 1080p, it's 3840x2160. "4K" is a wider, more cinematic resolution, 4096×2160. This may be one of those cases where the mis-use becomes so common that we just have to accept it, like "literally." Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-12 15:44 USB-C has "lanes," which get allocated, so it's not per se about bandwidth. Thunderbolt 3 supports 40 Gbps of data in each direction, but it has to be carved up and assigned to pins, essentially, which introduces limits so you can't make maximum use of the 40 Gbps with a mix of devices, depending on the mix. Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-12 15:46 Yes, this is what's confusing is that DisplayPort is both an alternate mode that works on USB-C without Thunderbolt 3 and (according to Intel's explanation) DisplayPort is incorporated inside Thunderbolt 3 separately. So a 5K monitor via Thunderbolt 3 is technically using Thunderbolt 3 alternate mode and DisplayPort inside that, while a 4K connected to any USB-C is using DisplayPort in alternate mode directly. Reply Openreels   2016-11-12 12:16 Gawd this is a mess! What we really need is a "USB-C Ecossytem" diagram that shows all the various sub-connections and how they relate (ie" what can carry, or is compatible with, what). I'd make one myself if I could get it all straight! Here's a resource that might be helpful: https://hermanproav.com/learningcenter.aspx?id=290 Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-12 15:46 That's an excellent idea.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware  ⋮  Rumor Intel Cannonlake Processors and 300-Series Motherboards Allegedly Launching in Late 2017 By Hassan Mujtaba Posted 5 days ago 115Shares Share Tweet Submit Intel is said to launch their 8th generation Cannonlake processors in late 2017. A report from Digitimes has alleged that Intel has scheduled the launch of their Cannonlake processors and 300-Series motherboards in late-2017. Intel Cannonlake CPUs and 300-Series Motherboards Scheduled For Late 2017 Launch Intel’s Cannonlake CPU lineup would replace the upcoming Kaby Lake processors which are going to launch at CES 2017. The new processors are based on a new process technology and would feature additional CPU and GPU architecture enhancements for improved performance. Digitimes has revealed that 300-series products will be available in late 2017 which would allow support for the 8th generation desktop processors. Intel reportedly is planning to add USB 3.1 and Wi-Fi functions into its motherboard chipsets and the new design may be implemented in its upcoming 300-series scheduled to be released at the end of 2017, according to sources from motherboard makers. Intel declined to comment on market speculation. via Digitimes Some of the key features that would be added to the new 300-series motherboards is native USB 3.1 and WiFi functionalities. This would allow Intel to not rely on third party manufacturers for WiFi and USB 3.1 controllers. This would affect many companies such as Broadcom, Realtek and ASMedia who either supply WLAN or USB – 3.1 chips. But at the same time, it would allow Intel to increase and standardize the new technologies on their platforms. Intel 200-series motherboards would be out in January so we will have to wait at least 10-12 months before we get to see 300-series products in the market. It is not known whether they would change the socket with 300-series but since it’s a die shrink of Skylake, it may be kept compatible with current LGA 1151 socket. Intel Begins Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X HEDT CPU Sampling - Massive Skylake-X CPU Pictured, Designed For LGA 2066 Socket Intel Cannonlake CPUs Rumored For 2017 Launch – Here are The Expected Features and Details Intel Cannonlake CPUs will be based on a new 10nm process node which would improve power efficiency. The new process would allow faster clocks under the same power envelope but we expect to see a bit more from Cannonlake CPUs. Although Cannonlake may be considered as a die shrink of Skylake or Kaby Lake which have the same basic architecture hierarchy, Cannonlake would be a bit different. We expect to see some sort of CPU and GPU architecture enhancements that would lead to IPC gains. We can consider this the same jump as we saw from Sandy Bridge to Ivy Bridge. Moving on, the Cannonlake CPUs will be compatible with DDR4-2400 MHz (native). Advertisement Kaby Lake, the code name for a new microprocessor due to begin production late this year using Intel’s current 14-nanometer technology. Cannon Lake, Intel’s first 10nm microprocessor, due late in 2017. Ice Lake, the second generation of 10nm technology While Cannonlake is said to launch in 2017, we aren’t exactly sure whether Intel would be naming the family as Coffee Lake or Cannonlake. Coffee Lake is the name of the family that will feature the 14nm process node but would be architecturally similar to Cannonlake chips. The true Cannonlake chips which are not internally known as Coffee Lake are based on 10nm process node and the new enhancements. A previous leak revealed that Cannon Lake-S chips (desktop) would be part of the Coffee Lake family. So they might not be based on 10nm process, but rather 14nm.

Since this would be the fourth 14nm family for desktop platforms, Intel can update the total core count to 6 on mainstream desktop PCs. It is already known from roadmap leaks that Intel would be upping the core count for Coffee Lake-H platforms to 6 so it doesn’t make sense not to do the same with the desktop platforms. More details for the entire Intel CPU family roadmap can be seen here. It will be interesting to see how Intel handles the desktop launch of Cannonlake / Coffee Lake chips in late 2017. For all we know, the 300-series boards sound like a good deal for mainstream users who aren’t interested in the upcoming 200-series boards. For now, we are waiting for the launch of Kaby Lake and 200-series motherboards in January 2017.

For example, we can host more than 1,000 simultaneous graphics accelerated sessions in a single Penguin Computing Tundra Open Compute rack.” Scyld Cloud Workstation provides secure, easy remote access to Linux and Windows workstation-class desktops through standard web browsers – eliminating the need for client-side installations and changes to firewall policies. Scyld Cloud Workstation offers significant time savings by removing the requirement to download large data files by moving pre- and post-processing to the cloud for highly efficient HPC workflows. “The rapid adoption of cloud-based HPC solutions is driving the need for 3D accelerated remote desktops,” said Al Diaz, VP and general manager, Product Collaboration and Services Division, Data Center Group, Intel Corporation. “By supporting Intel VCA, Penguin Computing is able to deliver a very cost effective remote desktop solution.” Intel’s Visual Compute Accelerator brings 4K high definition media processing capabilities to platforms based on the Intel® Xeon® processor E5 family. The Intel Visual Compute Accelerator integrates three Intel Xeon processors E3 with Intel Iris™ Pro graphics and Intel Media Server Studio-enabled hardware accelerated video processing into a PCIe card form factor that fits into Intel Xeon processor E5-based servers. “With the rise of cloud computing, the requirement for high-density remote desktop solutions is a critical focus for us,” said Thomas Ruge, CEO and Founder, Colorado Code Craft, who partners with Penguin to deliver Scyld Cloud Workstation. “What’s unique about this Scyld Cloud Workstation is the capability to run highly-interactive user applications, such as CAD and HPC apps for viewing and rotating 3D data directly in the cloud.” In September, Penguin Computing announced Scyld Cloud Workstation 3.0, which provides true multi-user remote desktop collaboration for cloud-based Linux and Windows desktops. The announcement included a range of new features including improved quality of service intelligence for Scyld Cloud Workstation – ensuring that the user experience of a Scyld remote desktop feels like a local workstation.

HP has reinvented the professional workstation — again — with the announcement of the world’s first mini workstation at Autodesk University 2016 in Las Vegas. First to market with the small form factor (SFF) workstation in 2010 and again with the all-in-one workstation in 2012, the computing giant has forged yet another new product category with the HP Z2 Mini, designed for users of CAD and other compute-intensive applications. Measuring a mere 8.5” x 8.5” x 2.3”, the HP Z2 Mini is ten times smaller than a traditional tower workstation and weighs in starting at 4.5 lb. It is twice as powerful as any commercial mini PC on the market today, according to HP, and can support six displays right out of the box. Shorter than a cup of espresso, the new HP Z2 Mini Workstation is capable of designing anything from state-of-the-art electronics to home and office buildings. System Configuration The HP Z2 Mini runs on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro or Linux and comes equipped with Intel Xeon E3-1200v5 or Intel Core i3/i5/i7 processors as well as optional NVIDIA professional graphics and HP Z Turbo Drive for speedy large-file handling. It is equipped with two SODIMM memory slots, one 2.5” internal drive bay, and one M.2 PCIe expansion slot. As for graphics, the Z2 Mini offers Intel integrated graphics and optionally, the new NVIDIA Quadro M620 2GB discrete mobile workstation GPU. Dual monitors are possible via the integrated graphics, plus an additional six via the optional GPU, for a total of six possible monitors.   Wolf in sheep’s clothing: The new HP Z2 Mini looks unassuming but packs the power of a full-size workstation. On the side, the Z2 Mini has two USB 3.0 ports (one charging); on the back, it has two USB 3.0 and two USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-C ports and one audio line in. A mounting sleeve is available to attach the unit to the back of a monitor, the underside of a desktop, a wall, or other location. An optional Kensington Security Slot allows for physically locking the unit in place. Short in stature, the HP Z2 Mini isn’t short on ports. When Other Workstations Just Won’t Do HP Z2 Mini designed for what HP sees as the workspace (and the worker) of the future and aims to covert the 42% of designers who still are not using a professional workstation. Several trends drove development: Computer performance needs are increasing as CAD users move from 2D to 3D design. Workflows can’t afford downtime so hardware reliability is a must. Desk space is shrinking — in fact, HP reports a 60% space reduction per person in the United States over the past ten years. Workspaces are cluttered on the desktop (38% of users have two or more displays, according to HP, and floor space tends to be crowded, hot, and dirty. Users want attractive products, even when it comes to a computer chassis. According to HP, design is the No. 2 concern among end users; 52% of millennials believe design is important when choosing a PC.      “We realized that we needed to reinvent what it meant to be a workstation." The new model offers more than three times the graphics performance of an HP business-class mini PC, is 63% quieter even when running at a heavy load, and has had three times the quality testing —368,000 hours total. It is ISV certified for more than 20 critical applications, including most Autodesk and Adobe software as well as SOLIDWORKS. Groundbreaking Design The HP Z2 Mini was a design feat as much as an engineering one. The octagonal HP Z2 Mini, the company claims, is the most uniquely designed system in the company’s 35-year workstation history. Like a mobile workstation, the Z2 Mini packs a lot of powerful (and power-hungry) components into a small space, requiring high-end cooling capabilities. Vents are designed into all four corners of the unit, each with a guard to prevent air-flow blockage should it be inadvertently pushed against something. The front panel pops off to provide access to machine components, including a fan that swings up to reveal  system memory. Lead designer Paul Drew said his team aimed for a design that conveys “luxury” — a premium look and feel — with black chrome on the vents and a surface inside the vent guards “that reflects light onto the chrome and gives it sparkle. “When you express the function visually, it’s usually beautiful,” Drew said. HP has a reputation for listening to its workstation users, and brainstorming with customers resulted in several key design moves. For example, the system features remote power-on using any keystroke or mouse click from as far away as 30 ft. It also is mountable behind a monitor to save desk space. “This came out of brainstorming about what customers give up and what they gain when the unit is mounted behind the display. Customers identified this need, then HP engineers figured out how to solve for it."   The new HP Z2 Mini workstation is shown mounted behind a dual-monitor setup.   “If we had we not shared our plans with customers, we might not have identified this, said  Josh Peterson, director, worldwide product management, HP Z Workstations. “We also moved power button from back to front [to make it more accessible]. We wanted front to be clean but made the change in the interest of customers.” The Z2 Mini will inevitably lure away many users of the HP Z1 all-in-one and SFF workstations; approximately 80% of SFF users could obtain a comparable configuration with the Z2 Mini. But, “We’re committed for now to supporting development of the SFF” as well as the Z1, said Jeff Wood, vice-president and general manager, Workstations and Thin Clients. “Right now the Z2 is as small as we can go,” Wood added. “To go any smaller would require the components to produce less heat. It took six years [to evolve from the original HP Z desktop workstations to the Z2 Mini] so we don’t see getting any smaller in the near future.” Pricing and Availability Covered by HP’s standard three-year workstation warranty, the HP Z2 Mini is expected to be available worldwide in December starting at $699.   About the Author: Nancy Spurling Johnson E-mail Nancy Spurling Johnson About Nancy Spurling Johnson See contents by Nancy Spurling Johnson Note: Comments are moderated and will appear live after approval by the site moderator.

If you are running Windows on your Mac - like I'm doing on my 2015 retina MacBook Pro because macOS is far too unoptimised to run on it - and it's using an Intel graphics chip, be sure to replace Apple's own Boot Camp graphics drivers with Intel's own latest drivers. The reason why you should do this is kind of fascinating. I noticed that while Windows as a whole ran quite fast and snappy - much more so than macOS with its crappy responsiveness, FPS drops, and hangs, even after reinstallations - two applications had responsiveness issues: Chrome and Microsoft Office. With Chrome, I chalked it up to #justchromethings and moved on. With Office though, I was perplexed. The past few versions of Office, including the current one, are fast, snappy, and instant. The days where Office applications were slow and cumbersome are long gone, even on lower-end hardware like the 2015 retina MacBook Pro. However, Office applications were slow, rendering was terrible, and things like dragging and resizing Office windows was literally a slide show - and I wanted to know why. I found out that on Windows, Microsoft Office uses its own rendering pipeline (framework? I'm not really sure what the accurate terminology is here), different from both Win32 and Metro applications. As it turns out, Office does its own check of the video card and driver to determine if hardware acceleration for Office should be disabled or not. By default, hardware acceleration is automatically disabled in Office programs if certain video card and video card driver combinations are detected when you start an Office program. If hardware acceleration is automatically disabled by the program, nothing indicates that this change occurred. Well, except that Office now runs like a total dog, of course. Apparently, the Office team maintains its own list of video card/driver combinations and keeps this list a secret. The list of video card/video driver combinations that trigger this automatic disabling of hardware graphics acceleration is not documented because the list is hard-coded in the Office programs and will be constantly changing as we discover additional video combinations that cause problems in Office programs. When I ran the Intel Driver Update Utility on my retina MacBook Pro to determine if the Apple-provided Intel graphics driver was up-to-date, the tool found a newer driver, but warned me that my OEM (Apple) had modified the already-installed driver, and that I would lose those customisations. I proceeded to download the new driver anyway, only to be hit by a very peculiar dialog upon trying to install the driver Intel told me was newer than what I had installed: the installer warned my I was installing an older driver than what I had installed. So, I decided to download the latest driver (the latest beta) manually, installed it, and this fixed not just Office, but also Chrome - which I find particularly baffling (maybe Chrome maintains a similar list?). The list that the Office team maintains is not of good drivers, but of bad drivers. For Office's hardware acceleration to fail, the driver needs to be on the list. This means that the combination "Apple-modified Intel graphics driver/Iris 6100" was, at some point, added to the list, triggering the disabling of hardware acceleration for Office. The combination "Intel's own graphics driver/Iris 6100" is not on the list. There's a number of possible explanations here, and I'm not really sure which one makes the most sense. Apple cares too little about Boot Camp users to intentionally cripple the Apple-supplied Intel drivers, so that's definitely not the cause. I also don't think the Intel driver magically improved a ton in the span of just a few weeks (there's only a few weeks of difference between the two versions, but I'm not trusting version numbers here) - but maybe it did? I honestly don't know. It's Intel's beta driver that isn't even signed by Microsoft, but somehow, the Office team tested it and removed it from their list? My first instinct was to think that because Apple had modified the driver, it wasn't on Microsoft's list - but since the list is for bad drivers, that makes no sense. The most logical explanation I have right now - suggested by Steven Troughton-Smith - is that Apple changes a few things in the Intel driver to optimise Windows' battery life, which in turn tune down the performance, causing the Office team to add this specific driver/video card combination to the list. I've been keeping an eye on battery life since installing the driver, but haven't noticed much of a difference. I don't think this little tip will be useful for a lot of people, but I really enjoyed trying to figure out what was going on.

(Kobi Gideon/GPO) YERUSHALAYIM - Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu inaugurated a new $6 billion production line at the Intel plant in Kiryat Gat on Monday. During the opening ceremony, Netanyahu told Intel employees: “The vision of the future is realized here, now. You are producing a new future. Using technology, you amplify Israel’s power. Israel is a global technological superpower. The national revolution is to do away with the periphery called Kiryat Gat, Beersheva, Afula and Yokneam. There is no south or north; we are doing away with the periphery.” The government contributed a $300 million grant to creating the new line, which employs new chip production technology. Netanyahu toured the plant together with Prime Minister’s Office Director-General Eli Gruner and National Economic Council head Prof. Avi Simhon. They met with company employees and managers and visited the clean room where chips are produced. Amir Faintuch, Intel senior vice president and representative of its global management, told Netanyahu during the visit that Israel, in which Intel has four R&D centers and a production plant, will play a key role in the strategic change the company has been undergoing recently. “At present, Intel is turning from a company specializing only in developing and producing chips to a company whose developments drive cloud-based computer centers and billions of smart, connected devices,” he said. Intel VP and Intel Israel CEO Maxine Fassberg said that Intel has invested over $17 billion in Israel and, over the next decade, is expected to purchase goods and services totaling NIS 18.7 billion in Israel.

Depending on the reviewer, the Touch Bar feature is either a gimmick or a productivity-boosting addition. As for performance, the reviews are mixed: some people are saying that a lot faster SSD and RAM make the machine super snappy and others note Intel’s Skylake chips barely push performance forward versus 2013 or later MacBook Pros. Jason Snell, Six Colors The Touch Bar delighted Snell: The Touch Bar is an animated interface through and through. Items don’t just fade in and out, but also slide smoothly back and forth. The arrow pointing from the Touch Bar to the Touch ID sensor during a request for an unlock grows and shrinks, practically begging you to put your finger down. There’s a lot more personality here than I expected. To balance out the design, the Touch Bar’s OLED screen doesn’t extend all the way to the left edge of the glass. As a result, the Touch Bar always appears inset from the rest of the keyboard. It’s a bit weird. Here’s a video of Snell’s thoughts on the Touch Bar. For those wondering, you can hit the ESC key on the Touch Bar without hitting the button itself. Tapping the corner of the Touch Bar blindly triggers an ESC key event, as you can see in John Gruber’s video below. This is great if you’d like to hit ESC without looking down at the keyboard. Jim Dalrymple, The Loop Jim discusses the RAM non-issue: To see how the new 15-inch MacBook Pro would do with audio, I opened a 40-track Logic Pro project. The song had a mix of loops, drums, and live recorded instruments. I played back the track, recorded some more guitars, added effects and did everything I would normally do with a music project. When I looked at the memory usage for Logic Pro, it was using 1GB RAM. The MacBook Pro has 16GB, so I have a lot of room before I ever have to worry about running out of memory. I know that having 16GB RAM is a concern for some people, but you could never put more than 16GB RAM in a MacBook Pro, so I don’t get the problem. Pros and other customers have been successfully using these computers for years. Just because it takes more RAM to use a Windows machine effectively, that doesn’t mean the same thing for a Mac. You have to look at the entire picture, hardware, software, system software, and memory optimizations. Unlike some other reviewers, Jim does not think that the Touch Bar is a gimmick. Most of us are so engrained in our workflow that we do things without even thinking about. However, when you do think to check the Touch Bar, you can see how things can be done simpler and easier. Here’s a small example. Have you ever opened the calculator app and had to choose to type in the numbers or click with the mouse? No matter what you do, it’s a pain just because of the type of app it is. With Touch Bar, all of the calculator functions are in the Touch Bar, directly above the numbers on the keyboard. This is clearly so much easier. There are a lot of examples like this with Apple’s apps and there will be many more when third-party developers add support for Touch Bar in the next few months. Touch Bar is cool, but let’s not neglect Touch ID. When the system wants your password to make changes, or delete an app, you can just place your finger on the Touch ID sensor and you’re done. The same can be done in System Preferences when making changes. It’s so much quicker than typing in your password. It’s a small thing, but it all matters. Susie Ochs, Macworld Susie was impressed with the more powerful speakers. What isn’t a bummer are the new speakers, my favorite non-Touch Bar feature of the new machines. Apple explained that since they are connected right to the battery with no transformer between them, the speakers can get twice the peak power—and you can really hear the difference. Music sounds great when you turn the volume all the way up, and the speakers are powerful enough to provide satisfying sound while watching movies, TV, and sports. The 15-inch model’s speakers seem to have more oomph than the 13-incher’s, but both can ably fill a hotel room with music, if you should want to leave your portable Bluetooth speaker at home. Her hands-on video is available at the source link. I’m not embedding it here due to Macworld’s ill-practice of auto-starting videos in the background. Should you buy the new Pro now or later? These new MacBook Pros have a lot going for them. Their biggest weakness, across the whole Touch Bar line, is price. These prices could come down a little bit next generation, but if you need a MacBook Pro right now, the late 2016 models are solid performers. If I were buying one for myself, I’d go with the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and max out the storage, although the 15-inch model is even better. Or simply wait (if you can) until prices of the new Pros inevitably fall next year as Apple refreshes them around Intel’s Kaby Lake chips. Walt Mossberg, The Verge WSJ’s former technology columnist took his 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar for a spin, deciding that the notebook that was once mainly aimed straight at people who do especially taxing work like professional video editing or serious design is “now being stretched to suit a much larger audience.” He experienced some problems with the inconsistent battery life: On my rigorous test, which I’ve used for years, the machine actually exceeded Apple’s claim of up to 10 hours of battery life. The test involves setting the screen at 100 percent, keeping it on and undimmed constantly, playing an endless loop of music, and leaving Wi-Fi on to collect email, tweets, and Facebook posts in the background. Result: 11 hours and 38 minutes. I ran a second test with all of Apple’s default energy-saving settings on, the screen at 75 percent and a perfectly normal (for me) mix of tasks like web browsing, email, a few short videos, Twitter, Facebook, some light writing, and Slack. The Pro died at 8 hours and 22 minutes. To make things worse, Apple’s built-in prediction of how much time the battery had left before dying fluctuated a lot and was mostly wrong. According to Mossberg, Apple says this is a known problem caused by the fact that modern processors can power up and down rapidly over a much wider range than in the past, making estimates much more difficult. In conclusion, he wrote: The new 13” MacBooks—even the base model without the Touch Bar—are costly. And they may make pros unhappy. But, for everyday Mac lovers—users of the Air or maybe the older low-end Pro—they are now your only thin, modern, option with a full-fledged processor. The Touch Bar has potential, but it’s not magic. The battery isn’t likely to deliver on Apple’s claims. You can’t count on liking the keyboard. But, if you’re a Mac devotee ready to move past the Air—not back to a lower-powered MacBook—this is what Apple is offering. Take it or leave it. The new MacBook Pro is a “fast, slim tweener,” wrote Mossberg. Joanna Stern, The Wall Street Journal Even with the faster chips and new hardware features like the Touch Bar and Touch ID, you’ll get the same performance and battery as in the older model, notes WSJ. So how do you decide? Do you invest in the present—the “old” MacBook Pro with performance, good-enough portability, a keyboard to cherish and lots of ports? Or do you invest in the future—a beautiful, highly portable machine with new tricks? Or maybe you do what I’m doing: Stare down at your three-year-old laptop and wonder if you can tough it out another year or two while this sorts itself out. Here’s her video hands-on. Brian Heater, TechCrunch Brian likes the speed bump provided by faster chips, SSD and RAM, saying these features make the new MacBook Pros worthy upgrades, “particularly for those who have been suffering through their old system’s death rattles (or fan buzzing, at least), waiting for a significant update” from Apple. Better processors, more storage, a brighter display and better speakers are all wrapped up in a sleeker and lighter package than before. The Touch Bar feels like a nice bonus for the time being. It’s a compelling new input device that has the potential to alter the way we interact with applications on a laptop. In conclusion, the author wrote: For those who have been holding out on buying a new MacBook, the time is right, with an upgrade that should be sufficiently future-proof to take on the next few years — or however long it takes for the next major upgrade. Hopefully you’ve been saving up in the meantime. Brian X. Chen, The New York Times Brian calls the new MacBook Pros light and fast—“probably powerful enough for most professionals”—but notes these machines aren’t for everyone because the Touch Bar so far “feels gimmicky” and “not many devices or accessories come with USB-C connectors yet.” One thing is sure: For casual users or anyone buying their first laptop, who may just want a computer for web browsing and lightweight apps, the MacBook Pro is overkill. So if you aren’t ready to make the jump to USB-C and you don’t want to spend a big chunk of your savings, it’s reasonable to wait for the new Apple notebooks to realize their potential or drop in price. Dan Ackerman, CNET Dan thinks Apple’s new mainstream MacBook Pro is going to be liked by a whole lot of new customers. On the downside, he notes that the Touch Bar itself “isn’t a must-have” right now. In his opinion, the 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar is likely going to be the default mainstream choice for price-sensitive consumers. While the five percent of the laptop buyers who consider themselves true creative professionals may take various issues with the machine, the remaining 95 percent should see it as a compelling choice. It’s far and away Apple’s most-advanced laptop. The touchpad has double the surface area of the previous model, it’s about as light as a MacBook Air but much thinner (14.9mm versus 18mm), and the flatter butterfly style keyboard has been subtly tweaked to work better here than it does in the 12-inch MacBook. Andrew Cunningham, Ars Technica Andrew notes that folks who use their notebook connected to an external display most of the time with its lid closed won’t have much use for the Touch Bar shortcuts. If it’s being used as a desktop with an external keyboard a significant amount of the time, the Touch Bar does nothing for you. When I went out of my way to use Apple’s apps, I liked the Touch Bar a lot. It just takes one or two useful buttons—creating a new tab in Safari, looking up a main page in Terminal, changing font sizes or creating checklists in Notes—to make you glad the Touch Bar is there. However, a typical day for me is spent mostly in Word, Outlook, Slack, Tweetbot, and Chrome. Microsoft is bringing Touch Bar support to Office, but if other app makers don’t start adding in support, a big chunk of that bar is going to end up sitting empty most of the time. Moving on to graphics, Apple states that the discreet Polaris-based AMD chip (Radeon Pro 450, Radeon Pro 455 and built-to-order Radeon Pro 460) inside the new Pro can drive up to four 4K external displays at 60 Hz simultaneously or two 5K displays at 60 Hz simultaneously (alongside the built-in screen). This is possible thanks to a technique called Multi-Stream Transport (MST) which permits the machine to push two DisplayPort 1.2 streams to the monitor over the single Thunderbolt 3 cable. When you hook one of LG’s 5K monitors to one of the new MacBook Pros, what you’re actually seeing on the screen is two pictures stitched together to make a single seamless image. This is because the version of the DisplayPort specification supported by Intel’s GPUs and almost all monitors these days—version 1.2—doesn’t have enough bandwidth to drive a 5K display at 60Hz all by itself. There’s nothing wrong with this method, except that it cuts down on the number of external displays your computer can support. Intel’s integrated GPUs can drive a total of three displays, but you use up two of those three streams to drive one 5K monitor and one of them to drive the laptop’s internal display. AMD’s GPUs support up to six displays, so you can use two of those connections for one 5K monitor, two of them for the other 5K monitor, one for the laptop’s internal display, and still have one left over for yet another monitor if you really wanted to use one. Switching from Intel’s integrated Iris Pro graphics in favor of dedicated AMD GPUs has resulted in significant graphics performance improvements over previous models, Andrew observes. In his tests, the mid-range 2.7GHz 15-inch MacBook Pro model with AMD’s built-in Radeon Pro 455 graphics chip showed a “significant boost” over this year’s revised twelve-inch MacBook and older 2012-2015 MacBook Pros dedicated GPUs (Nvidia’s built-to-order GeForce GTX 650M and GeForce GTX 750M, plus AMD’s Radeon R9 M370X). Omg the flip side, the new Pros lack the oomph required for high-end gaming and VR. Is it disappointing that Apple didn’t decide to push the envelope a little more? Sure. Is it too bad that performance and power efficiency were apparently sacrificed in the name of external display support? Yes. Are these midrange GPUs in any way inconsistent with any MacBook Pro released in the last decade? No. Here’s how the new Pro scored in the GFXbench synthetic GPU benchmark. Apple says that the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch ID has 130 percent faster graphics and up to 2.5x more computing power per watt versus the previous-generation 15-incher, but keep in mind that Apple’s numbers are based on AMD’s built-to-order Radeon Pro 460 chip. Andrew doesn’t think Apple should have used Nvidia’s Pascal-based GPUs instead of AMD’s even though Nvidia chips do provide support for the latest DisplayPort 1.3 specification. That’s because Thunderbolt 3 and external displays currently max out at DisplayPort 1.2 and are yet to implement support for DisplayPort 1.3. Apple will have more flexibility again when DisplayPort 1.3 becomes more common. Those future laptops will be able to drive two 5K screens plus a laptop’s internal screen using just three DisplayPort streams instead of five. For now, though, if pushing two high-end 5K screens at once was a design goal for Apple, AMD was the only way to go. Fun fact: Pascal GPUs from Nvidia cannot drive dual 5K displays via MST. Does he recommend buying the new Pro? If you’ve got a MacBook Pro that you bought in 2012 or earlier and if you’re convinced of the potential utility and novelty of the Touch Bar, these 2016 MacBook Pros were just about worth the wait. Replace a four- or five-year-old laptop with one of these and you’ll get a great new design, a respectable performance boost, a nice screen, the single most versatile port you can get in any computer, and a new input device…The main problem at this point isn’t that the Touch Bar is a bad idea, but that these laptops cost a whole bunch of money. Great, premium PC laptops are available for half this price, even if Apple still maintains an edge when it comes to graphics and SSD speeds. It really feels like the Touch Bar needs to be included in the $1,499 model, and that versions of the new designs without Touch Bars should be the entry level systems—right now, Apple’s entry-level Mac laptops were all released in mid 2015, and that’s only going to get more embarrassing as time moves on. Lance Ulanoff, Mashable On the removal of all the legacy ports from the new Pro and the Dongle Hell: Removing all those ports was certainly a risky move for Apple, but, in truth, the most you could fault them for is maybe leaping a little too far into the future. Apple is not the only company adopting USB-C. It’s a standard, after all, and just like USB spelled the end of the line for parallel and serial ports, USB-C will eventually be the port to rule all ports, and those peripherals you’re clinging to will someday, in the not too distant future, be deemed too slow or feature-poor to keep you competitive. Is “Dongle Hell” a real thing? In the short term, yes. In the long term, a single multipurpose port will always be the winner. src=&#8221;http://mashable.com/videos/embed?video=qBSPfJH2&#038;player=offsite&#8221; width=&#8217;593&#8242; height=&#8217;333&#8242; Lance criticizes the new Pros as being a bit on the expensive side, but they’re still “an excellent upgrade with a fascinating and highly extensible new Touch Bar.” Dana Wollman, Engadget I’m one of many Mac owners out there who has been waiting for Apple to upgrade the MacBook Pro line. Now that it finally has, I find the new laptop isn’t quite what I wanted. For me, the ideal MacBook Pro is actually a mashup between this and last year’s model. She disliked the fact that some system controls are buried within Touch Bar menus: What’s annoying about this whole setup is that either way, some of the most important system controls are now buried in Touch Bar menus. Want to lower the volume? You can either hit the volume icon and hit the slider, or hit the arrow key and tap the volume up or down key. That’s less efficient than just pressing a dedicated volume button in the function row. It’s inconvenient enough that I eventually started using my mouse to do things like pause Spotify or raise the volume on a track. Apple made me change my way of doing things, and not necessarily for the better. That pisses me off. Touch ID and a thinner design are nice, but she wants her ports back. There’s lots to like about the new MacBook Pro: its slimmed-down design, brighter screen, improved audio, faster graphics and disk speeds. But by doing things like removing full-sized USB ports, the memory card reader and even the Function row, Apple seems to forgotten how many of us actually work. An even better MacBook Pro would be one that doesn’t require users to make “drastic changes to their workflow,” she says. Then, of course, there would be no progress if Apple didn’t challenge the status quo. Christina Warren, Gizmodo To Christina, the new MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar is currently a gimmick that’s not worth the money until more third-party applications support it. It’s somewhat useful, but it’s still so undersupported for apps beyond Apple’s that, at least for right now, the Touch Bar is not reason enough to get a new MacBook Pro. Particularly if you’re already satisfied with the performance of your existing machine. If you need a new MacBook Pro and you can’t wait for the Kaby Lake refreshes already rumored, the benefits of the internal specs matched with the cool-factor of the Touch Bar make this a good Mac. For everyone else this is a gimmick on a very good, way too expensive laptop. Third-party support for the Touch Bar is sparse but growing. Expect apps focused on design and coding to adopt first. My favorite Touch Bar app so far is 1Password, largely because it uses the Touch Bar and Touch ID. I really hope Google chooses to support the Touch Bar. It could be very useful, especially with extensions. On the other hand, she totally loves Touch ID and thinks it’s an “awesome” addition to the Mac, but is also  ”bummed” about the lack of a rose gold color option. Dongle Hell? To use your old peripherals, you’ll be in dongle hell for the short term, but the 4 Thunderbolt 3 ports at least give lots of connectivity options for the future. As for the performance, her review states that both the base 13-inch model without Touch Bar and the base 15-inch model with Touch Bar were performant across Gizmodo’s benchmarks. Christina offered a word of advice to would-be buyers: “If you’re getting the 13-inch, consider spending the extra $200 on 16GB of RAM now, since you cannot upgrade later.” Harry McCracken, FastCo Beyond the svelter design, Touch Bar, and new ports, the new MacBook Pros shows multiple refinements that, on their own, wouldn’t prompt anyone to splurge on a new computer. They just make that new computer better once you have it, and are the sort of improvements that Apple never gets enough credit for making. The MacBook Pro’s high-resolution Retina display would have been one of the biggest reasons to upgrade from a MacBook Air no matter what. But it’s also brighter than previous screens—at full blast, it makes my eyeballs tingle—offers better contrast, and has a wider color gamut for more accurate reproduction of photos. Edward C. Baig, USA Today Edward likes using Touch ID to get into the computer and approve purchases. He’s not too concerned about the removal of legacy ports in favor of USB-C. In fact, USB-S, he writes, at least gives consumers more choices in terms of the chargers. You can use pretty much any USB-C charger to juice up your Mac, though if you try a cellphone charger as I did, it might not charge quite as fast as using the supplied USB-C power adapter, which incidentally replaces the old MacSafe adapter. He’s a fan of the redesigned speaker system that Apple says provides twice the dynamic range of earlier MacBook Pros (“What I can say is that the speakers are loud and crisp, and the overall audio quality is excellent”) and likes the new low-profile keyboard: I never fully cozied up to the “butterfly” style Qwerty keyboard on Apple’s MacBook notebook and was worried when I first learned that the MacBook Pro keyboard was based on the same technology. But the refined second-generation butterfly mechanism used here represents a marked improvement. The keys are responsive. I felt perfectly comfortable, for instance, typing this column out on the keyboard. Like many other reviewers, he balked at the MacBook Pro’s high price which makes the powerful notebook pricier than it’s ever been before and out of reach of many notebook buyers like myself. Chris Davies, Slashgear In dropping almost all legacy ports in favor of Thunderbolt 3, ignoring the Windows 10 style of touchscreen in favor of supplementary Touch Bar and adopting the low-profile butterfly keyboard, Apple has created a pretty “contentious machine,” Chris writes. In his opinion, Apple has not really forgotten the “professional” in recreating the MacBook Pro as other commenters have claimed before him. Has Apple forgotten the professionals which are arguably its most vocal advocates? I don’t think that’s true, though I do suspect that group now finds itself at the fringe of MacBook Pro users. Such is the side-effect of a user group in general expanding. Like Touch ID, the Touch Bar as a brand new hardware feature is currently in infancy and will need some time to take off and realize its potential in full: Ergonomically, I’m among those still content with a non-touch primary display. My experience with the Touch Bar, meanwhile, has left me mighty curious to see what comes next as third-party developers get to grips with the potential of the added interface. Right now, a large part of its usefulness is in replicating keyboard shortcuts: that’s handy if you’re unfamiliar with them, but it’s no great surprise that longtime Mac users have been less wowed. The new MacBook Pros have huge trackpads, but Chris saw no issues resting his hand on them due to flawless palm rejection. All that extra room makes macOS gestures easier, and there’s less swipe-and-lift involved in general navigation. I was a little worried about palm-rejection, given the size of the trackpad means there’s a reasonable chance some part of your hand or wrist might be resting on it at times, but Apple’s improved algorithms there have seemingly done the trick, and I’ve not noticed any issues. The sheer size of the trackpad makes him wish that Apple had added Pencil compatibility for repurposing the trackpad as a graphics tablet. Now, that’s a clever idea!

Other Ars staffers who saw the Touch Bar were impressed that it had the same amount of color and detail as any old Retina display. Andrew Cunningham Buttons have, by and large, been replaced by sliders. Andrew Cunningham Customizing the Touch Bar buttons in software. The new design of the MacBook Pros is nice, and Apple’s decision to put in nothing but Thunderbolt 3 ports has prompted a fresh wave of dongle talk, but the signature feature of the new MacBook Pros was always going to be the Touch Bar. This little touch-enabled strip represents a bunch of things. It’s a melding of Apple’s traditional Intel-driven software platform and the company’s own homegrown chips and its touch-driven iOS platform. It’s Apple’s answer to the touchscreen, a model that Apple steadfastly resists in its computers even as Microsoft and its partners embrace it. And it's the biggest thing about these Macs that’s truly new—Macs in the last half-decade have gotten thinner and lighter and have better battery life than before, but, Touch Bar aside, they all still run basically the same software in basically the same way. So, yes, these new laptops have new CPUs and GPUs, new designs, new ports, and new screens. We’ll spend plenty of time with all of those things. But the biggest question for buyers is whether the Touch Bar is worth it and what it adds to the experience that you can’t already get if you keep the latest version of macOS installed on your laptop. Differences between all three MacBook Pros Specs at a glance: 13-inch 2016 Apple MacBook Pro (Four Thunderbolt 3 ports) Screen 2560×1600 at 13.3" (227 PPI) OS OS X 10.12.1 Sierra CPU 2.9GHz Intel Core i5-6267U (Turbo up to 3.3GHz) RAM 8GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 (soldered, upgradeable to 16GB at purchase) GPU Intel Iris 550 (integrated, 64MB eDRAM) HDD 256GB PCIe 3.0 x4 solid-state drive Networking 1.3Gbps 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2 Ports 2x Thunderbolt 3, 2x Thunderbolt 3 with reduced bandwidth, headphones Size 11.97" × 8.36" × 0.59" (304.1 mm × 212.4 mm × 14.9 mm) Weight 3.02 lbs (1.37 kg) Battery 49.2Whr Warranty 1 year Starting price $1,799.99 Price as reviewed $1,799.99 Other perks 720p webcam, backlit keyboard, three integrated mics We've been over this a few times, but let's list the differences between the $1,499 MacBook Pro and the Touch Bar model. There are a couple of new details I can confirm now that I’ve actually been able to use both models. The low-end Pro uses a 15W Core i5-6360U CPU with an Intel Iris 540 GPU; the high-end model uses a 28W Core i5-6267U CPU with an Intel Iris 550 GPU. The difference, aside from small boosts to CPU and GPU clock speeds, is that the 28W model can run faster for longer and throttle less frequently. The 15W model can also consume less power. The low-end Pro uses a single “Alpine Ridge” Thunderbolt 3 controller from Intel, while the high-end Pro uses two Thunderbolt controllers. The two ports on the right side of the MacBook Pro have "reduced PCI Express bandwidth," which Apple says means they have two PCIe 3.0 lanes’ worth of bandwidth at their disposal instead of the four lanes dedicated to the ports on the left side (Intel’s mobile Skylake chipsets include a total of 10 PCIe lanes, four of which are already being used by the SSD). You can connect all the same things to both ports—displays, storage, power adapters—but especially high-performance storage arrays should be plugged in on the left side to maximize the available bandwidth. The low-end Pro uses 1866MHz LPDDR3 RAM while the high-end Pro uses 2133MHz LPDDR3. Apple has said it’s using LPDDR3 to save power, but it’s also the reason the systems max out at 16GB. The low-end Pro actually has a larger battery than the high-end one: 54.5Whr compared to 49.2Whr. Apple says both laptops have 10 hours of battery life, but the lower-power processor, the larger battery, and the lack of a little second screen above the keyboard all mean that the low-end model actually lasts a bit longer than the Touch Bar model. The low-end model includes two integrated mics, while the high-end model includes three. The low-end Pro’s 802.11ac Wi-Fi tops out at 867Mbps, while both the Touch Bar MacBook Pros can do a maximum of 1.3Gbps just like last year’s models. And here are a few further differences between both 13-inch models and the 15-inch models, all of which include Touch Bars. 15-inch Pros have enough thermal headroom to fit in quad-core Skylake processors. The base model includes a 2.6GHz (3.5GHz Turbo) Core i7-6700HQ, while our review unit uses a 2.7GHz (3.6GHz Turbo) Core i7-6820HQ. Either model can be configured with a 2.9GHz (3.8GHz Turbo) Core i7-6920HQ. All models use their processors’ Intel HD 530 integrated graphics when possible to save power, but they also include dedicated AMD Radeon GPUs. The Radeon Pro 450, 455, and 460 are all based on AMD’s latest Polaris architecture—we’ll go into more detail about each component later in the review. The trackpad in the 15-inch model is larger than in the 13-inch models. All four Thunderbolt 3 ports in the 15-inch Pros offer the same amount of PCIe bandwidth, since Intel’s quad-core CPUs add more PCIe 3.0 lanes to the amount that the chipset includes (in total, Apple is using four lanes for the SSD, eight lanes across all four Thunderbolt 3 ports, and another eight lanes for the dedicated GPUs). Using the 15-inch model Specs at a glance: 15-inch 2016 Apple MacBook Pro Screen 2880×1800 at 15.4" (220 PPI) OS OS X 10.12.1 Sierra CPU 2.7GHz Intel Core i7-6820HQ (Turbo up to 3.6GHz) RAM 16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 (soldered) GPU AMD Radeon Pro 455 with 2GB RAM, Intel HD 530 HDD 512GB PCIe 3.0 x4 solid-state drive Networking 1.3Gbps 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2 Ports 4x Thunderbolt 3, headphones Size 13.75" × 9.48" × 0.61" (349.3 mm × 240.7 mm × 15.5 mm) Weight 4.02 lbs (1.83 kg) Battery 76.0Whr Warranty 1 year Starting price $2,399.99 Price as reviewed $2,799.99 Other perks 720p webcam, backlit keyboard, three integrated mics The reduced size and weight of the 15-inch Pro are both really nice when you’re carrying the machine around. At just four pounds, it actually weighs less than the 4.5 pound 13-inch MacBook Pros did before the jump to Retina, and it’s a pound-and-a-half lighter than the pre-Retina 15-inch models (there’s a less consequential but still nice half-pound reduction compared to the older Retina models). When you're using it, though, it’s still very much a 15-inch laptop. I use 13-inch laptops almost exclusively these days, and the more cumbersome size and larger palmrest make the 15-inch models just a little unwieldy compared to what I’m used to. In other words, even with the size and weight decreases, the 15-inch model isn't small enough to be a good replacement for a 13-inch notebook. I will say that my minor palm rejection problems with the 13-inch Pro’s larger trackpad aren’t really problems here. It may be because the trackpad is larger, so the corners of my hands are always firmly placed on the trackpad as I type rather than hitting it intermittently. Beyond this, the experience of typing and of using the trackpad is identical. The 2880×1800 screen has the same resolution as the older Retina models, albeit with the added brightness and contrast and the wide color support. But like the MacBook and the 13-inch Pros, the screen’s default resolution is 1680×1050 mode. As with the previous models, you can also select 1024×600, 1280×800, 1440×900, and 1900×1200 modes depending on what’s the most comfortable for you. Finally, the speakers here are much larger than the ones in the 13-inch model, and they sound pretty good for laptop speakers. They have respectable bass and dynamic range. While they aren’t as good as the speakers in a desktop like an iMac or some good dedicated speakers, they’re good enough for movies and TV, and they aren’t bad if you need to fill a room with music for a small party.

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases CORRECTING and REPLACING — Cray Inc. In a release issued earlier today under the headline “Cray XC40 “Theta” Supercomputer Accepted and in Production at Argonne National Laboratory” by Cray Inc. (Nasdaq:CRAY), please note that the headline included the phrase “and in Production”. The system has been accepted but is not yet in production. The corrected release follows: Cray XC40 “Theta” Supercomputer Accepted at Argonne National Laboratory SEATTLE and SALT LAKE CITY, Nov. 14, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — At the 2016 Supercomputing Conference in Salt Lake City, Utah, global supercomputer leader Cray Inc. (Nasdaq:CRAY) today announced it has achieved acceptance for “Theta,” the Cray® XC40™ supercomputer, as well as a Cray Sonexion® 3000 storage system, located at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF), a U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility at Argonne National Laboratory. The Theta system marks Cray and Intel’s first acceptance for a large-scale supercomputer featuring the latest generation of Intel® Xeon Phi™ processors formerly code named “Knights Landing.” Theta has a peak performance of more than eight petaflops, and is currently running a broad range of scientific applications through the ALCF’s Theta Early Science Program. The Cray XC40 system was delivered to Argonne National Laboratory through a partnership with Intel as part of the DOE’s initiative to build state-of-the art supercomputers through the Collaboration of Oak Ridge, Argonne, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (CORAL) program. “The Argonne Leadership Computing Facility is committed to providing advanced supercomputing resources, like the Theta system, that help our researchers solve some of the world’s largest and most complex problems,” said Rick Stevens, Associate Laboratory Director for Argonne National Laboratory. “We are pleased that Theta is now accelerating our scientific research.” Cray, in partnership with Intel, will also deliver a flagship system called “Aurora” as part of the CORAL program. Aurora will be based on the next-generation Cray supercomputer code named “Shasta,” the successor to the current, industry-leading Cray XC™ line of supercomputers. Aurora is expected to have a peak performance of 180 petaflops and is scheduled for delivery in 2018. “The acceptance of Theta is a significant milestone for Cray and Intel as we continue to work towards the installation and acceptance of several Cray supercomputers with the new Intel Xeon Phi processors,” said Peter Ungaro, president and CEO of Cray. “Our collaboration with Intel and Argonne is focused on producing powerful supercomputers for the DOE user community. The Theta system is exciting step forward in our partnership, and one that I know many other supercomputer centers around the world are watching as they evaluate this new processor technology for their next mission-critical system.” Cray is a leader in deploying supercomputers with the Intel Xeon Phi processors, and several top supercomputing centers have signed large contracts for Cray XC™ supercomputers with Intel’s new processor. These systems include the “Cori” system at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC); the “Trinity” system at the National Nuclear Security Administration; and the Cray XC40 supercomputer at the Academic Center for Computing and Media Studies at Kyoto University in Kyoto, Japan. “The Theta supercomputer at Argonne is an important step in the CORAL project and a milestone on the path towards the Aurora system,” said Dr. Rajeeb Hazra, Vice President of the Data Center group and General Manager of the Enterprise and Government group at Intel. “The combination of Intel’s leading technology, latest Intel Xeon Phi processor technology, codenamed Knights Landing, Intel Scalable System Framework, and Cray’s system capabilities is helping to drive scientific discoveries and engineering breakthroughs.” For more information on the Cray XC supercomputers and Cray Sonexion storage systems, please visit the Cray website at www.cray.com.

Ilia Mirkin Takes To Hacking On SWR Gallium3D, Fixes ~600 Piglit Bugs Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 14 November 2016 at 11:16 AM EST. 23 Comments Ilia Mirkin, the prolific independent contributor to Mesa who started off on improvements to the Nouveau open-source NVIDIA driver a few years ago and has also contributed to Freedreno, has now turned to Intel's SWR Gallium3D software rasterizer as his latest target. Mirkin remains one of the most prolific open-source contributors to Mesa not associated with any of the companies like AMD, Intel, Collabora, etc but just working on Mesa and the open-source Linux graphics stack in his spare time. With this patch series published over the weekend, Mirkin has 14 patches lined up affecting several hundred lines of code in the SWR Gallium3D software rasterizer. The patches improve texture resource manipulation and redoes the surface layout for the SWR driver. The patches also prep for other potential performance improvements. The good news from these patches alone is that they fix around 600 Piglit tests! Great job Ilia. 23 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the Intel plant in Kiryat Gat today to inaugurate its new production line, which employs new chip production technology. The upgrade of machinery in this project had cost $6 billion, including a $300 million government grant. Netanyahu visited the plant together with Prime Minister's Office Director-General Eli Gruner and National Economic Council Head Prof. Avi Simhon. They met with company employees and managers and visited the clean room where chips are produced. The prime minister also examined efforts to upgrade production lines at the plant, which will enable chip production using some of the world's cutting edge technology. RELATED ARTICLES Intel to build 'smart' Israel development center Teva teams with Intel to analyze Huntington disease "Intel's Israel team has done it again" Mobileye, Intel and BMW to build self-driving cars At the end of the visit, Netanyahu met with Intel employees for the production line inauguration ceremony, in which Intel executives provided him with a piece of silicon produced at the plant. Netanyahu told Intel employees, "The vision of the future is realized here, now. You are producing a new future. Using technology, you amplify Israel's power. Israel is a global technological superpower. The national revolution is to do away with the periphery called Kiryat Gat, Beersheva, Afula and Yokneam. There is no south or north, we are doing way with the periphery." Amir Faintuch, Intel senior vice president and representative of its global management, told Netanyahu during the visit that Israel, in which Intel has four R&D centers and a production plant, will play a key role in the strategic change the company has been undergoing recently. "At present, Intel is turning from a company specializing only in developing and producing chips to a company whose developments drive cloud-based computer centers and billions of smart, connected, devices," he said. Faintuch added that Haifa hosted the first Intel development center outside the US and that some of Intel's most advanced and successful developments in the past decades have been made in Israel, including the Intel Core processors used in most of the world's computers. Intel VP and Intel Israel CEO Maxine Fassberg said that Intel has invested over $17 billion in Israel and, over the next decade, is expected to purchase goods and services totaling NIS 18.7 billion in Israel. "Intel Israel is proud and excited to host the prime minister. In its 42 years, Intel has turned into an inseparable part of Israel's market, Israel's economy and Israel's society. Tens of thousands of Intel employees are a mirror of Israel's population: from all sectors and professions and all contributing to our shared success. Together, we have been developing southern Israel, promoting Israeli exports and leading the world of technology." Intel's Israel production plant CEO Daniel Benatar said during the meeting that a new kind of technological Zionism has been taking place in Kiryat Gat in the past few years. "Intel is building here one of the world's most advanced plants, using thousands of hard working employees, from engineers, electrical engineering and chemistry doctors to welders, pipe fitters and construction workers, Israelis from across the spectrum of Israeli society - Jews, Arabs, Druze and Bedouins, religious, ultra-orthodox, young 25 year olds and veteran employees over 60; this is a source of pride for Israel."

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Report: unlocked Kaby Lake Core i3 CPU may be on the way by Wayne Manion  12:00 AM on November 14, 2016 Intel has historically been at best ambivalent when it comes to allowing overclocking of its low-end and mid-range CPUs. The golden days of Celeron 300A CPUs being overclocked to near-performance-equivalence with the Pentium III 450 are in the distant past. The only throwback to that time that the silicon giant has offered in the last decade was the multiplier-unlocked Pentium G3258 from mid-2014. That situation could change, if rumors that sprung up over the weekend about an unlocked Core i3 CPU prove true. A price list posted by online vendor ShopBLT suggests the existence of a Core i3-7350K CPU based on Intel's latest 14-nm seventh-generation Core "Kaby Lake" architecture. Notorious rumor mill website WCCFTech goes on to speculate that this CPU will have an unlocked multiplier and support for Intel's Turbo Boost feature, something that up until now hasn't been offered in Core i3 processors. The anticipated i3-7350K will allegedly pack two cores with Hyper-threading, backed up by 4MB of on-die cache. The leak says the factory base clock speed will be 4.0GHz, and can use Turbo Boost to reach 4.2GHz. This information isn't completely surprising, however. Back in August, Jeff had a little chat with Intel's Dan Ragland, who sort-of-alluded to a value-oriented overclockable chip. Kaby Lake's improved process technology and resulting clock headroom seem like a good basis for an overclockable CPU, too. WCCFTech claims contradictory TDP specifications of 61W and 91W for the dual-core chip. The site offered no information with respect to integrated graphics, but we would be shocked if the Core i3-7350K lacked Kaby Lake's more efficient graphics architecture with hardware support for H.265 video. WCCFTech's SKU list also lists several other Core i3 models with Turbo Boost. Similarly, the rumor mongers suggest simultaneous multi-threading is spreading from Intel's Core CPU line to a pair of Pentium SKUs, the Pentium G4600 and G4620. The ShopBLT listing pegs the Core i3-7350K at $177. That price is closer to the current cheapest unlocked Intel CPU, the $242 Core i5-6600K, than it is to the Pentium G3258's introductory price of $72.

The 15-inch MacBook Pro hooked up to some external 5K displays. Andrew Cunningham The 15-inch Pro and the 13-inch Touch Bar model. Andrew Cunningham The new Pro comes in both space gray and silver. Andrew Cunningham The glowing Apple logo on the back is no more. Andrew Cunningham The new 15-inch model has a big trackpad and big speaker grilles to the left and right of the keyboard. Andrew Cunningham The Touch Bar models have four Thunderbolt 3 ports, unlike the $1,499 model. Andrew Cunningham The Touch Bar displaying emoji. Other Ars staffers who saw the Touch Bar were impressed that it had the same amount of color and detail as any old Retina display. Andrew Cunningham Buttons have, by and large, been replaced by sliders. Andrew Cunningham Customizing the Touch Bar buttons in software. The new design of the MacBook Pros is nice, and Apple’s decision to put in nothing but Thunderbolt 3 ports has prompted a fresh wave of dongle talk, but the signature feature of the new MacBook Pros was always going to be the Touch Bar. This little touch-enabled strip represents a bunch of things. It’s a melding of Apple’s traditional Intel-driven software platform and the company’s own homegrown chips and its touch-driven iOS platform. It’s Apple’s answer to the touchscreen, a model that Apple steadfastly resists in its computers even as Microsoft and its partners embrace it. And it's the biggest thing about these Macs that’s truly new—Macs in the last half-decade have gotten thinner and lighter and have better battery life than before, but, Touch Bar aside, they all still run basically the same software in basically the same way. So, yes, these new laptops have new CPUs and GPUs, new designs, new ports, and new screens. We’ll spend plenty of time with all of those things. But the biggest question for buyers is whether the Touch Bar is worth it and what it adds to the experience that you can’t already get if you keep the latest version of macOS installed on your laptop. Differences between all three MacBook Pros Specs at a glance: 13-inch 2016 Apple MacBook Pro (Four Thunderbolt 3 ports) Screen 2560×1600 at 13.3" (227 PPI) OS OS X 10.12.1 Sierra CPU 2.9GHz Intel Core i5-6267U (Turbo up to 3.3GHz) RAM 8GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 (soldered, upgradeable to 16GB at purchase) GPU Intel Iris 550 (integrated, 64MB eDRAM) HDD 256GB PCIe 3.0 x4 solid-state drive Networking 1.3Gbps 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2 Ports 2x Thunderbolt 3, 2x Thunderbolt 3 with reduced bandwidth, headphones Size 11.97" × 8.36" × 0.59" (304.1 mm × 212.4 mm × 14.9 mm) Weight 3.02 lbs (1.37 kg) Battery 49.2Whr Warranty 1 year Starting price $1,799.99 Price as reviewed $1,799.99 Other perks 720p webcam, backlit keyboard, three integrated mics We've been over this a few times, but let's list the differences between the $1,499 MacBook Pro and the Touch Bar model. There are a couple of new details I can confirm now that I’ve actually been able to use both models. The low-end Pro uses a 15W Core i5-6360U CPU with an Intel Iris 540 GPU; the high-end model uses a 28W Core i5-6267U CPU with an Intel Iris 550 GPU. The difference, aside from small boosts to CPU and GPU clock speeds, is that the 28W model can run faster for longer and throttle less frequently. The 15W model can also consume less power. The low-end Pro uses a single “Alpine Ridge” Thunderbolt 3 controller from Intel, while the high-end Pro uses two Thunderbolt controllers. The two ports on the right side of the MacBook Pro have "reduced PCI Express bandwidth," which Apple says means they have two PCIe 3.0 lanes’ worth of bandwidth at their disposal instead of the four lanes dedicated to the ports on the left side (Intel’s mobile Skylake chipsets include a total of 10 PCIe lanes, four of which are already being used by the SSD). You can connect all the same things to both ports—displays, storage, power adapters—but especially high-performance storage arrays should be plugged in on the left side to maximize the available bandwidth. The low-end Pro uses 1866MHz LPDDR3 RAM while the high-end Pro uses 2133MHz LPDDR3. Apple has said it’s using LPDDR3 to save power, but it’s also the reason the systems max out at 16GB. The low-end Pro actually has a larger battery than the high-end one: 54.5Whr compared to 49.2Whr. Apple says both laptops have 10 hours of battery life, but the lower-power processor, the larger battery, and the lack of a little second screen above the keyboard all mean that the low-end model actually lasts a bit longer than the Touch Bar model. The low-end model includes two integrated mics, while the high-end model includes three. The low-end Pro’s 802.11ac Wi-Fi tops out at 867Mbps, while both the Touch Bar MacBook Pros can do a maximum of 1.3Gbps just like last year’s models. And here are a few further differences between both 13-inch models and the 15-inch models, all of which include Touch Bars. 15-inch Pros have enough thermal headroom to fit in quad-core Skylake processors. The base model includes a 2.6GHz (3.5GHz Turbo) Core i7-6700HQ, while our review unit uses a 2.7GHz (3.6GHz Turbo) Core i7-6820HQ. Either model can be configured with a 2.9GHz (3.8GHz Turbo) Core i7-6920HQ. All models use their processors’ Intel HD 530 integrated graphics when possible to save power, but they also include dedicated AMD Radeon GPUs. The Radeon Pro 450, 455, and 460 are all based on AMD’s latest Polaris architecture—we’ll go into more detail about each component later in the review. The trackpad in the 15-inch model is larger than in the 13-inch models. All four Thunderbolt 3 ports in the 15-inch Pros offer the same amount of PCIe bandwidth, since Intel’s quad-core CPUs add more PCIe 3.0 lanes to the amount that the chipset includes (in total, Apple is using four lanes for the SSD, eight lanes across all four Thunderbolt 3 ports, and another eight lanes for the dedicated GPUs). Using the 15-inch model Specs at a glance: 15-inch 2016 Apple MacBook Pro Screen 2880×1800 at 15.4" (220 PPI) OS OS X 10.12.1 Sierra CPU 2.7GHz Intel Core i7-6820HQ (Turbo up to 3.6GHz) RAM 16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 (soldered) GPU AMD Radeon Pro 455 with 2GB RAM, Intel HD 530 HDD 512GB PCIe 3.0 x4 solid-state drive Networking 1.3Gbps 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2 Ports 4x Thunderbolt 3, headphones Size 13.75" × 9.48" × 0.61" (349.3 mm × 240.7 mm × 15.5 mm) Weight 4.02 lbs (1.83 kg) Battery 76.0Whr Warranty 1 year Starting price $2,399.99 Price as reviewed $2,799.99 Other perks 720p webcam, backlit keyboard, three integrated mics The reduced size and weight of the 15-inch Pro are both really nice when you’re carrying the machine around. At just four pounds, it actually weighs less than the 4.5 pound 13-inch MacBook Pros did before the jump to Retina, and it’s a pound-and-a-half lighter than the pre-Retina 15-inch models (there’s a less consequential but still nice half-pound reduction compared to the older Retina models). When you're using it, though, it’s still very much a 15-inch laptop. I use 13-inch laptops almost exclusively these days, and the more cumbersome size and larger palmrest make the 15-inch models just a little unwieldy compared to what I’m used to. In other words, even with the size and weight decreases, the 15-inch model isn't small enough to be a good replacement for a 13-inch notebook. I will say that my minor palm rejection problems with the 13-inch Pro’s larger trackpad aren’t really problems here. It may be because the trackpad is larger, so the corners of my hands are always firmly placed on the trackpad as I type rather than hitting it intermittently. Beyond this, the experience of typing and of using the trackpad is identical. The 2880×1800 screen has the same resolution as the older Retina models, albeit with the added brightness and contrast and the wide color support. But like the MacBook and the 13-inch Pros, the screen’s default resolution is 1680×1050 mode. As with the previous models, you can also select 1024×600, 1280×800, 1440×900, and 1900×1200 modes depending on what’s the most comfortable for you. Finally, the speakers here are much larger than the ones in the 13-inch model, and they sound pretty good for laptop speakers. They have respectable bass and dynamic range. While they aren’t as good as the speakers in a desktop like an iMac or some good dedicated speakers, they’re good enough for movies and TV, and they aren’t bad if you need to fill a room with music for a small party.

Mesa 13.0.1 Is Out for Linux with Improvements for Intel & Radeon Vulkan Drivers GO The GLX GLVND driver received some fixes as well Nov 14, 2016 14:50 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  After informing us last week about the availability of the Release Candidate (RC) version of the first point release of Mesa 13.0.0, as well as about Mesa 13.0.1's upcoming launch on November 13, 2016, Collabora's Emil Velikov released the final version today. As noted in our previous report, Mesa 13.0.1 3D Graphics Library is here with a large number of improvements for both Intel and Radeon Vulkan drivers, thus enhancing our gaming experience once again. For the Intel ANV Vulkan driver, it looks like it adds up to 30 percent performance increase. On the other hand, the latest RADV improvements allow you to install and use the Radeon Vulkan driver outside the /usr/lib directory on a Linux-based operating system, which is possible because of the implementation of distinctly named JSON files that contain the full path of the Vulkan driver. "Up-to 30% performance increase using the Intel ANV Vulkan driver. The Radeon RADV Vulkan driver now ships with distinctly named json files, which include the full Vulkan driver path. Making it possible for people to install and use the drivers outside their /usr/lib directory," wrote Emil Velikov, Software Release Engineer at Collabora. More RADV improvements, GLX GLVND driver fixes But that's not all that was implemented in today's Mesa 13.0.1 3D Graphics Library release, as we can notice even more Radeon Vulkan driver improvements, such as the ability to correctly advertise support for the Xlib platform extension, which finally lets users use RADV alongside the open-source Dolphin GameCube and Wii emulator. The handling of XCB and Xlib connections was improved as well, for both Intel and Radeon Vulkan drivers, allowing them to advertise the correct versions of their supported extensions. On top of that, Mesa 13.0.1 promises lots of enhancements to the GLX GLVND driver.

Picture: Stuart McEvoy Supratim Adhikari The Australian 12:00AM November 15, 2016 Save Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on email Share more... Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Whatsapp Print this articleX Supratim Adhikari Technology Editor Melbourne @SupratimA The McAfee brand is about to start flying solo again after a hiatus of six years and the man in charge of leading the reinvigorated entity, Chris Young, is confident it has the chops to become the leader of the pack when it comes to ­securing the internet. Mr Young’s new gig comes courtesy of a $US1.1 billion ($1.45bn) deal, sealed in September, between US semiconductor giant Intel and private equity heavyweight TPG Capital, in which TPG will take a 51 per cent stake in Intel Security and run it as a new independent company, McAfee. The deal values the security business about $US4.2bn, including debt. Intel retains a 49 per cent stake in the new entity. It also brings things full circle for the tech giant, which paid $US7.6bn in cash to buy the ­McAfee business in 2010. It wasn’t the best bit of business by Intel and while the cybersecurity space has evolved a lot in the past six years Mr Young said a lot of the foundational work done during the ­period would now bear fruit under TPG’s ownership. “There’s a ton of security in everything that Intel does and the company has invested a lot of money into building the foundation technology elements of our product portfolio,” Mr Young told The Australian. Intel has invested over $US500 million over the past year in the security business, revamping its solutions portfolio and opening up its Data Exchange Layer (DXL) security communications fabric to share threat intelligence. “This new future for the security business gives us the opportunity to really focus on the space with a new energy and we will be able to do the things we want to do without any distractions,” Mr Young said. That new focus would be geared towards giving enterprise users a unified platform, eliminating the need for them to deal with multiple vendors and to manage multiple security solutions. “The tagline for the new brand is together is power and we are putting our money where our mouth is when it comes to bringing together the disparate pieces of our customer’s security infrastructure,” Mr Young said. He said another big advantage Mc­Afee would look to leverage was the global scale of the ­company. “We will be one of the largest in the marketplace with nearly 8000 people globally; there are 1400 vendors in the market and less than two or three are even close to that size,” he said. “Most of the industry is very point-product oriented but we have taken a more solutions-­oriented approach where we don’t go after specific issues but bring automated use-case driven workflows to bear.” McAfee is betting customers will see the advantage of moving away from tackling the three points of the threat defence life cycle — protect, detect and correct. Companies rely on specific products that are designed to do either one or some of those three things but Mr Young says customers are better served by a single layer that allows organisations to seamlessly co-ordinate all three components. “As vendors, it’s up to us to create solutions that reduce the burdens on individuals that operate the security apparatuses of our customers,” Mr Young said. It’s not every day you get the chance to push the limits of a trusted and well-known brand like McAfee and Mr Young said the timing could not be better to challenge the status quo. “Security has moved from the backroom to the boardroom. It’s now a fundamental topic for our society and it’s a massive change in the way we think about the problem,” he said. “As security professionals, we need to continuously challenge our own assumptions.” With physical crime now manifest over the digital world, Mr Young said organisations were starting to lift their game on understanding the value of the data but emergent trends like the Internet of Things would pose a new complexity. “Most of us in the industry have said for some time that IoT will increase the attack surface,” he said. “One of the ways to mitigating high volume attacks has to be the use of machines to detect attacks, but one of the big challenges with IoT is the heterogeneity of devices. “So there’s still a lot of work that needs to be done.” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on email Share more...

HEXUS did a thorough review of this budget OC-capable chip and gave it a coveted 'Editor's Choice' award due to its strong value, performance, and overclockability. That 2C/2T chip still sells but is getting rather long in the tooth... Now rumours / leaks suggest that Intel is preparing a new affordable OC champ within the slightly higher end (from a Pentium) Core i3 Kaby Lake desktop range. This story features on several sites today with not one providing sources but WCCF Tech appears to have published the earliest and has a convincing looking Intel inventory screengrab (see below). So let's gather together all the details so far spilled about the next gen overclockable i3. The Intel Core i3-7350K will run with a maximum boost frequency of 4.2GHz out of the box. This unlocked multiplier 'K' chip will be a dual-core part with four threads (2C/4T). An L3 cache of 4MB will help speed processing along. The TDP of the i3-7350K will be 91W, says one report, matching the 'K' models from both Kaby Lake i5 and i7 desktop ranges. Crucial to the Intel Core i3-7350K's popularity will be its pricing. Yes, it looks set to be the most expensive new Core i3 but it's still a significant chunk cheaper than a multiplier locked 4C/4T Core i5 and allows enthusiasts to indulge in fully flexible OC shenanigans. The i3-7350K's price is expected to be below $180. Another interesting budget-minded member of the new Kaby Lake range, if far-east sourced leaks last month were correct, will be the first Pentium to feature Hyperthreading. The Intel Pentium G4620 reputedly features a 3.7GHz clock speed and 2C/4T. Are these lower-end unlocked and hyperthreading enhanced parts Intel's foot soldiers to combat AMD Zen in the popular sub-$200 and sub-$100 markets next year?

OTH,the Core i5 7400 for around £190 looks comparatively better IMHO OFC. The Pentium G4260 looks a better prospect - at under £100. If the pound were not so weak,it would be an £80 CPU. Posted by cheesemp - Mon 14 Nov 2016 14:30 CAT-THE-FIFTH OTH,the Core i5 7400 for around £190 looks comparatively better IMHO OFC. Agreed. This is like a Corsa ‘sports’. Designed to appeal to someone who like the idea of fast rather than actually being fast. I'd take 4 slightly slower cores over 2 cores (with hyperthreading) any day. Its even more apparent the i5 is better idea once you factor in a decent CPU Heatsink and fan to let you overclock it in a meaningful way… Posted by CAT-THE-FIFTH - Mon 14 Nov 2016 14:54 cheesemp Agreed. This is like a Corsa ‘sports’. Designed to appeal to someone who like the idea of fast rather than actually being fast. I'd take 4 slightly slower cores over 2 cores (with hyperthreading) any day. Its even more apparent the i5 is better idea once you factor in a decent CPU Heatsink and fan to let you overclock it in a meaningful way… The G4260 looks good too. If it were not for the weak pound,that would have equated to around £80. It basically looks like a rebadged Core i3 6100 with an RRP down from $117 to $98. Interestingly enough it appears the Core i3 chips might have boost clocks,so if you enable all cores Turbo on the cheapest one it should give you a free overclock! Posted by this_is_gav - Mon 14 Nov 2016 15:03 Despite the article saying the G3258 is “long in the tooth” (which it isn't in the sense that Intel's completely stagnated), I think I'd rather pick that up at the moment given it's half the price of this (and actually can be described as a budget overclocking chip).

Other Ars staffers who saw the Touch Bar were impressed that it had the same amount of color and detail as any old Retina display. Andrew Cunningham Buttons have, by and large, been replaced by sliders. Andrew Cunningham Customizing the Touch Bar buttons in software. The new design of the MacBook Pros is nice, and Apple’s decision to put in nothing but Thunderbolt 3 ports has prompted a fresh wave of dongle talk, but the signature feature of the new MacBook Pros was always going to be the Touch Bar. This little touch-enabled strip represents a bunch of things. It’s a melding of Apple’s traditional Intel-driven software platform and the company’s own homegrown chips and its touch-driven iOS platform. It’s Apple’s answer to the touchscreen, a model that Apple steadfastly resists in its computers even as Microsoft and its partners embrace it. And it's the biggest thing about these Macs that’s truly new—Macs in the last half-decade have gotten thinner and lighter and have better battery life than before, but, Touch Bar aside, they all still run basically the same software in basically the same way. So, yes, these new laptops have new CPUs and GPUs, new designs, new ports, and new screens. We’ll spend plenty of time with all of those things. But the biggest question for buyers is whether the Touch Bar is worth it and what it adds to the experience that you can’t already get if you keep the latest version of macOS installed on your laptop. Differences between all three MacBook Pros Specs at a glance: 13-inch 2016 Apple MacBook Pro (Four Thunderbolt 3 ports) Screen 2560×1600 at 13.3" (227 PPI) OS OS X 10.12.1 Sierra CPU 2.9GHz Intel Core i5-6267U (Turbo up to 3.3GHz) RAM 8GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 (soldered, upgradeable to 16GB at purchase) GPU Intel Iris 550 (integrated, 64MB eDRAM) HDD 256GB PCIe 3.0 x4 solid-state drive Networking 1.3Gbps 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2 Ports 2x Thunderbolt 3, 2x Thunderbolt 3 with reduced bandwidth, headphones Size 11.97" × 8.36" × 0.59" (304.1 mm × 212.4 mm × 14.9 mm) Weight 3.02 lbs (1.37 kg) Battery 49.2Whr Warranty 1 year Starting price $1,799.99 Price as reviewed $1,799.99 Other perks 720p webcam, backlit keyboard, three integrated mics We've been over this a few times, but let's list the differences between the $1,499 MacBook Pro and the Touch Bar model. There are a couple of new details I can confirm now that I’ve actually been able to use both models. The low-end Pro uses a 15W Core i5-6360U CPU with an Intel Iris 540 GPU; the high-end model uses a 28W Core i5-6267U CPU with an Intel Iris 550 GPU. The difference, aside from small boosts to CPU and GPU clock speeds, is that the 28W model can run faster for longer and throttle less frequently. The 15W model can also consume less power. The low-end Pro uses a single “Alpine Ridge” Thunderbolt 3 controller from Intel, while the high-end Pro uses two Thunderbolt controllers. The two ports on the right side of the MacBook Pro have "reduced PCI Express bandwidth," which Apple says means they have two PCIe 3.0 lanes’ worth of bandwidth at their disposal instead of the four lanes dedicated to the ports on the left side (Intel’s mobile Skylake chipsets include a total of 10 PCIe lanes, four of which are already being used by the SSD). You can connect all the same things to both ports—displays, storage, power adapters—but especially high-performance storage arrays should be plugged in on the left side to maximize the available bandwidth. The low-end Pro uses 1866MHz LPDDR3 RAM while the high-end Pro uses 2133MHz LPDDR3. Apple has said it’s using LPDDR3 to save power, but it’s also the reason the systems max out at 16GB. The low-end Pro actually has a larger battery than the high-end one: 54.5Whr compared to 49.2Whr. Apple says both laptops have 10 hours of battery life, but the lower-power processor, the larger battery, and the lack of a little second screen above the keyboard all mean that the low-end model actually lasts a bit longer than the Touch Bar model. The low-end model includes two integrated mics, while the high-end model includes three. The low-end Pro’s 802.11ac Wi-Fi tops out at 867Mbps, while both the Touch Bar MacBook Pros can do a maximum of 1.3Gbps just like last year’s models. And here are a few further differences between both 13-inch models and the 15-inch models, all of which include Touch Bars. 15-inch Pros have enough thermal headroom to fit in quad-core Skylake processors. The base model includes a 2.6GHz (3.5GHz Turbo) Core i7-6700HQ, while our review unit uses a 2.7GHz (3.6GHz Turbo) Core i7-6820HQ. Either model can be configured with a 2.9GHz (3.8GHz Turbo) Core i7-6920HQ. All models use their processors’ Intel HD 530 integrated graphics when possible to save power, but they also include dedicated AMD Radeon GPUs. The Radeon Pro 450, 455, and 460 are all based on AMD’s latest Polaris architecture—we’ll go into more detail about each component later in the review. The trackpad in the 15-inch model is larger than in the 13-inch models. All four Thunderbolt 3 ports in the 15-inch Pros offer the same amount of PCIe bandwidth, since Intel’s quad-core CPUs add more PCIe 3.0 lanes to the amount that the chipset includes (in total, Apple is using four lanes for the SSD, eight lanes across all four Thunderbolt 3 ports, and another eight lanes for the dedicated GPUs). Using the 15-inch model Specs at a glance: 15-inch 2016 Apple MacBook Pro Screen 2880×1800 at 15.4" (220 PPI) OS OS X 10.12.1 Sierra CPU 2.7GHz Intel Core i7-6820HQ (Turbo up to 3.6GHz) RAM 16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 (soldered) GPU AMD Radeon Pro 455 with 2GB RAM, Intel HD 530 HDD 512GB PCIe 3.0 x4 solid-state drive Networking 1.3Gbps 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2 Ports 4x Thunderbolt 3, headphones Size 13.75" × 9.48" × 0.61" (349.3 mm × 240.7 mm × 15.5 mm) Weight 4.02 lbs (1.83 kg) Battery 76.0Whr Warranty 1 year Starting price $2,399.99 Price as reviewed $2,799.99 Other perks 720p webcam, backlit keyboard, three integrated mics The reduced size and weight of the 15-inch Pro are both really nice when you’re carrying the machine around. At just four pounds, it actually weighs less than the 4.5 pound 13-inch MacBook Pros did before the jump to Retina, and it’s a pound-and-a-half lighter than the pre-Retina 15-inch models (there’s a less consequential but still nice half-pound reduction compared to the older Retina models). When you're using it, though, it’s still very much a 15-inch laptop. I use 13-inch laptops almost exclusively these days, and the more cumbersome size and larger palmrest make the 15-inch models just a little unwieldy compared to what I’m used to. In other words, even with the size and weight decreases, the 15-inch model isn't small enough to be a good replacement for a 13-inch notebook. I will say that my minor palm rejection problems with the 13-inch Pro’s larger trackpad aren’t really problems here. It may be because the trackpad is larger, so the corners of my hands are always firmly placed on the trackpad as I type rather than hitting it intermittently. Beyond this, the experience of typing and of using the trackpad is identical. The 2880×1800 screen has the same resolution as the older Retina models, albeit with the added brightness and contrast and the wide color support. But like the MacBook and the 13-inch Pros, the screen’s default resolution is 1680×1050 mode. As with the previous models, you can also select 1024×600, 1280×800, 1440×900, and 1900×1200 modes depending on what’s the most comfortable for you. Finally, the speakers here are much larger than the ones in the 13-inch model, and they sound pretty good for laptop speakers. They have respectable bass and dynamic range. While they aren’t as good as the speakers in a desktop like an iMac or some good dedicated speakers, they’re good enough for movies and TV, and they aren’t bad if you need to fill a room with music for a small party.

Beloved workhorse of graphic designers, video editors, coders, and others wedded to the macOS ecosystem, any change to the MacBook Pro was going to be contentious. All the same, even stoic, self-confident Apple was seemingly rocked by the fierce reaction to features like Thunderbolt 3 and the brand new Touch Bar. Why not a full touchscreen? Why have you abandoned the legacy ports? Why make it thinner when pro-users care about power? Why aren’t the processor and graphics the very fastest, most cutting-edge? Why is memory limited to 16GB at most? Why are you forcing the MacBook’s keyboard on us? Amid it all, a common theme: Apple has forgotten the “Professional” in recreating the MacBook Pro. In a keynote filled with DJs, and family galleries in Photos, and Touch Bar access to emojis, was this new notebook no longer the machine of choice for the work-horse pro? Hardware and Design Familiar and yet different. At first glance you can’t confuse the MacBook Pro with anything else, but look closer and the differences this time around start to make themselves noticed. Biggest change for this new version is the addition of a second color, the same Space Gray as the 12-inch MacBook is offered in, alongside the original Silver. No sign of Rose Gold, however, and though Jet Black would be eye-catching, it’d also be a sea of scratches after one trip in your bag. Thickness and weight are down. The old 13-inch MacBook Pro was 3.48 pounds and 0.71-inches thick; its replacement is 3.02 pounds and 0.59-inches thick. Meanwhile the old 15-inch MacBook Pro was 4.49 pounds and 0.71-inches thick, which drops to 4.02 pounds and 0.61-inches with the new model. As has been Apple’s way for the past few generations, user-upgrades aren’t encouraged. If you get the base panel off, you’ll find processor and memory are of course soldered in. Unexpectedly, the PCIe storage is removable, but since it uses a custom SSD controller we’ll have to wait and see whether third-party suppliers will be allowed to offer replacements. Specifications and Performance In what’s become a fairly full desktop, I’ve had all three main versions of the new MacBook Pro on hand for testing. The $1,499 entry-level model, which lacks the Touch Bar, has a 2.0 GHz dual-core Core i5 and Intel Iris Graphics 540. It’s paired with 8GB of 1866 MHz LPDDR3 memory (16GB is an option) and a 256GB PCIe SSD (512GB/1TB are options). The 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has a 2.9 GHz dual-core Core i5 and Intel Iris Graphics 550, for $1,799. It’s paired with 8GB of faster, 2133 MHz LPDDR3 memory (again, 16GB is an option) and a 256GB PCIe SSD (with the same 512GB/1TB options). Both versions can be configured with Core i7 processors, up to 3.3 GHz. Finally, there’s a 15-inch MacBook Pro, with a 2.6 GHz quad-core Core i7 processor and both Intel HD Graphics 530 and AMD Radeon Pro 450 2GB graphics, priced at $2,399. It has 16GB of 2133 MHz LPDDR3 memory as standard, along with a 256GB PCIe SSD (with up to 2TB options). The fastest processor in the largest MacBook Pro is a 2.9 GHz Core i7 quad-core. Faster hardware has been top of the wishlist for MacBook Pro fans for some time, though Apple’s decisions haven’t been met with universal acclaim. Since Intel’s very latest 7th-generation “Kaby Lake” processors aren’t available in anything other than the ultra-low-voltage form Apple used in the 2016 12-inch MacBook update, and so it stuck with “Skylake”. Dual-core and quad-core “Kaby Lake” chips will arrive in 2017, Intel says, though when they might show up inside a MacBook Pro remains to be seen. The second controversy is memory. Even a fully maxed-out 15-inch MacBook Pro – which will set you back a cool $4,299 – can’t be had with more than 16GB of RAM. Whether you have 8GB or 16GB, it’s LPDDR3 not the newer, faster LPDDR4: Apple says that’s a power usage decision made in combination with using the “Skylake” chips. Benchmarks, of course, only tell part of the story, but they’re useful in contrasting between the three variations of notebook I have here. Geekbench 3’s results aren’t too surprising, though there’s clearly not a huge processing jump from going from the 2.0 GHz Core i5 dual-core to its 2.9 GHz sibling. The 15-inch’s extra cores play their hand, meanwhile, though performance on paper is still comparable to the old version. Apple has been pushing faster and faster solid-state storage in its notebooks for some generations now, and the new MacBook Pro line-up is no exception. Benchmark speeds were pretty consistent across all three models in QuickBench 4.0, hitting a hefty 2,909.2 MB/sec read and 1,571.2 MB/sec write at their fastest. Yes, Apple charges a fair amount to climb up through its SSD storage, but you can’t argue with the performance. Finally, there’s graphics. Again, Apple has come in for some criticism with its choices of GPU, specifically the discrete Radeon chips in the 15-inch MacBook Pro, which aren’t the very fastest in AMD’s line-up. All get Intel Iris graphics too, and they hold up well in the 13-inch notebooks in comparison to the outgoing model. Gains from the Radeon Pro 450 with its dedicated 2GB of memory aren’t vast; it’s worth remembering that this is the entry-level discrete GPU in Apple’s lineup. Even so, it’s a noticeable step up from the old machines. None of the new MacBook Pro models should be your first choice for graphics-intensive gaming – nothing new there – and those looking for the very fastest mobile GPU performance will still need to look to Windows notebooks, but all three are capable when it comes to video rendering, CAD and graphic design, and other such tasks. Display and Speakers Apple has stuck with its Retina-class resolution on both the 13-inch and 15-inch notebooks, the smaller using a 2560 x 1600 panel and the larger a 2880 x 1800 panel. Because of the way those screens work – by default, at least – you get a smoother 1440 x 900 on the 13-inch and 1680 x 1050 on the 15-inch. What’s new this time around is brightness, contrast, and color quality. For a start, brightness has climbed from 300 nits of the old model to 500 nits on the new. That means outdoor visibility is significantly improved, as well as screen legibility when dealing with reflections. The contrast ratio improvement helps too, now at 1,500:1 versus the 900:1 of the old LCD. Finally, there’s support for the DCI-P3 color space, which Apple has made such a big deal of in the recent iMac 5K and iPhone 7. In short, it means 25-percent more visible colors than with the old model, though reds and greens benefit particularly. Of course, you’ll also need DCI-P3 compliant images to actually tell the difference: luckily, the iPhone 7 shoots them, while if your standalone digital camera doesn’t produce them with its in-camera JPEG rendering, you can always edit them from RAW. Of course, many people prefer to use an external display, and that’s covered too. Courtesy of Thunderbolt 3 – more on which in the next section – you can drive as many as two 5K screens from the 15-inch MacBook Pro. The 13-inch isn’t quite as powerful, but can still handle a single 5K display or two 4K displays. Right now, native Thunderbolt 3 displays aren’t especially common, and Apple hasn’t replaced the discontinued Thunderbolt Display with a new version. Instead, it’s pushing LG’s UltraFine 5K and 4K screens, at 27- and 21.5-inches, which are $974 and $524 respectively until the end of the year. Unfortunately I’ve not been able to test them out yet. Apple is particularly proud of the speakers on the new MacBook Pros, boasting of twice the dynamic range. They definitely sound better than the system on the old notebook, particularly in the case of the 15-inch which has a surprising amount of power to fill a room. Part of the difference, I’m told, is that the speaker system is wired directly into the system power now, for triple the peak power of the old approach which used an intermediary converter. Physics only lets you get away with so much, of course, and while things sound balanced across the frequency range at low to medium volume, the bass starts to get overshadowed by treble and upper-mids at the upper end of the range. Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C If the processor, memory, and graphics decisions Apple made are the internal cause of the new MacBook Pro furore, the choice to ditch almost all of the legacy ports is the external trigger. Gone is MagSafe 2, and USB 3.1, and Thunderbolt 2, and HDMI, and the SD card slot. In there place, you have Thunderbolt 3 using the USB Type-C connector. The entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro – the one without the Touch Bar – gets two such ports. Any Touch Bar-equipped model doubles that to four. The 3.5mm headphone jack lingers on the right edge, quietly taunting iPhone 7 owners. Few disagree that Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C is the port of the future. Its advantage is its speed and flexibility: one single cable can deliver power, data, and display signals all at the same time. It’s fast, with up to 40 Gbit/sec data rates on paper at least, and backward compatible with USB 3.1 gen 2 (which maxes out at 10 Gbit/sec). Like Lightning, there’s no “right side up” and you can plug it in either way. Unusually, it’s bidirectional: the same port that one moment was drawing power from a hub, can the next minute be supplying power to an external hard-drive or other peripheral. In short, Apple fans would’ve been livid had Apple not included it on the new MacBook Pro. Instead, they’re just furious that Apple has embraced Thunderbolt 3 so enthusiastically. While it may be compatible with many of the ports we’ve grown used to over the past years, that requires adapters and dongles. Need to plug in a USB Type-A device? You’ll need a dongle. Want to connect your HDMI TV, or your VGA projector? You’ll need a dongle. Need a port for wired ethernet? You guessed it, you need a dongle. I’m a 12-inch MacBook user and have been since the first-gen model in early 2015. I mention that to make it clear that I’ve been living the USB-C-only lifestyle for some time now, and with just a single port. Along the way I’ve found some of the frustrations I expected to be less significant than I thought they’d be, and vice-versa. Adapters have become a part of my daily life. Most commonly, that’s because I need to import photos and videos from the SD card in my camera; I have a small card reader and Apple’s USB Type-A to Type-C dongle in my bag. Unplugged, the latter can be used to read USB drives, or connect to scanners or non-wireless printers. Would it be great to be able to plug everything in natively? Sure, though I think I thought something along the same lines back when floppy drives and CD drives and DVD drives rose and fell in popularity. Even the previous MacBook Pro with Retina display, which many are looking at with renewed fondness now, demanded I carry a Thunderbolt 2 ethernet adapter just-in-case. Personally, when it comes to adopting Thunderbolt 3 wholeheartedly I suspect Apple would’ve been damned if they did and damned if they didn’t. This commitment to the USB Type-C connector is exactly what the port needs for peripheral and accessory makers to take the transition seriously: I think we’ll see more USB-C devices, at a faster rate, as a result. Had Apple just switched the Thunderbolt 2 ports on the old MacBook Pro to Thunderbolt 3, and left the legacy connectors in place, we’d be complaining that the new standard was slow to gain traction. All the same, Apple could’ve handled this transition better. The fact that you’re paying upwards of $1.5k for a notebook and don’t get a USB Type-A to Type-C adapter in the box seems miserly: sure, Apple sells them now for nine bucks apiece, but it’s galling nonetheless. We’re yet to see a compelling USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 hub from the Cupertino firm either; I’ve been carrying Huawei’s, but reports from the Wild West of third-party options, many of which prove to be compromised in any number of ways, show the confusion Apple has dumped its users into. I suspect Apple has held off from addressing that situation because it expects it to go away in time. That’s probably true. All the same, right now for every moment of pleasure at plugging in a single 5K Thunderbolt 3 display and also having your MacBook Pro powered and hooked up to a row of extra ports for data, there’s the sting of “hang on, where’s my Type-A connector gone?” frustration. Touch Bar As someone who has used macOS for a reasonable number of years now, my fingers have picked up a fair few shortcuts along the way. Some, like command+S for save, or command+T for a new tab, or command+F for find have become second nature: my fingers punch them out before my brain consciously thinks about them. Ironically, it’s that which makes touchscreen notebooks less functional for me, since it’s quicker to hit a key combination than it is to reach up, tap the display, and then bring my hand back down again. My first inclination was to force myself to stop using shortcuts and rely on the Touch Bar instead. That’s harder than it first sounds, I discovered, not to mention fairly unproductive. Just like setting up your iOS home screen, or choosing what apps to have in your macOS dock, it pays to spend a few minutes customizing the Touch Bar before you wade in. That’s usually done in each individual app, where you get a selection of buttons you can drag down into the bar, or conversely drag those icons already present out. There’s also a global setting for the default shortcuts which is accessed in the System Preferences. It’d be more convenient if you could see every Touch Bar layout from there, for each different app, but right now you have to switch between apps individually. What surprised me was how quickly I got into the habit of using the Touch Bar, at least for certain tasks. Having switched back to Apple’s Mail app – I’d usually rely on Gmail’s browser interface, which also supports keyboard shortcuts – I found myself reaching up to stab the “Send” button on the Touch Bar alongside the escape key more often than not. In the Calendar app, being able to sweep through the weeks via the Touch Bar proved quicker than clicking through. Some of Apple’s more eye-catching demos are those that, ironically, don’t work so well on the Touch Bar. Picking out emojis is fine if you’re looking for one you frequently use – as on iOS, they’re clustered at the start of the list – but actually going hunting for something different requires a whole lot of swiping. It’s much easier to hit control+command+space and choose (or search) from there. Similarly, autocomplete when generally typing makes a lot less sense on a notebook than it does on an iPhone or iPad. At times, it can actually be less convenient than the regular buttons were. In Spotify, for instance, shortcuts for media control are now two taps away – first you touch to expand the Control Strip of core commands, and then you can hit play/pause or skip tracks – though that’s likely to become less of an issue as more developers add support. I’ve used the Touch Bar more than I thought I did, though there are clearly some areas where improvement could be made. Some will presumably be addressed in time, like third-party apps which don’t interact with the OLED strip at all. Others, though, depend on Apple choosing to embrace flexibility. Right now, for instance, there’s no way to assign macros to a Touch Bar button. You can’t have a single button that automatically starts a new email and populates the To: box with preset recipients, or that creates a Pages document with certain styles and sections. I have Automator workflows set up to convert different image or document formats to JPEGs, but I can’t assign them to the Touch Bar: all I have is Apple’s selection of pre-approved buttons to choose between. The company tells me that it can’t comment on what future integration might be added down the line. A small handful of third-party apps will have Touch Bar support at launch – Apple says that includes Day One, Coda, and Pixelmator – while others, like Sketch, Photoshop, djay Pro, and OmniGraffle will be updated by the end of the year. Microsoft has committed to Touch Bar support in Office, Outlook, and Skype, while utilities like 1Password will also embrace the finger-strip. That’s fine if you live in standalone software, but plenty of our time is now spent in web apps. Unfortunately, while Apple has APIs for standalone software, apps that live in the browser don’t get to play. Similarly, there was a conscious decision made not to allow notifications to break into the Touch Bar in any way: you can’t have pop-up alerts on there, like a ticker tape machine, and nor can you interact with shortcuts in macOS notifications like delete or reply. Overall, though, I’m curious to see how the Touch Bar fares once more people get their fingers on it. After you let go of the idea that it’s a baby-step toward a full touch display, and instead a third type of interface alongside keyboard and trackpad, it becomes a case of finding the moment it suddenly chimes with how you use macOS. If you really decide you don’t like it, meanwhile, you can set the Touch Bar to only show the function keys by default. Holding down the “Fn” button brings those old-school keys up temporarily, too. Touch ID Apple’s fingerprint sensor technology has at last made the jump from iOS to macOS, and it does much the same as the home button on the iPhone and iPad does today. Register your fingertip – up to five can be stored, though only at most three per user account – and tapping the square to the right of the Touch Bar will unlock your Mac and log you in. If you have more than one account set up, fingerprints can be used to switch between them. Again, as on the iPhone, you can optionally use Touch ID to authenticate payments using Apple Pay, and purchases through iTunes and the App Store. If you set up locked notes, Touch ID can be used to unlock them again. APIs for third-party developers will mean other software should be able to do similar things down the line, though right now I couldn’t find anything else which allowed me to log in via fingerprint. It’s one of those things that, after you’ve lived with it for a brief time, it’s jarring to go back to passwords. I’m in the habit of locking my Mac whenever I leave it: with Touch ID it’s less than a second and I’m back into the system – you don’t even have to wake the screen separately first; just tapping the scanner takes you straight to whatever you were working on last – in contrast to having to punch in a password multiple times a day. Apple has a new chip – the Apple T1 – which it uses to store fingerprint data and payment information securely. It’s actually a surprisingly clever little chunk of silicon, in some ways more akin to a smartwatch than anything else, but the key element is the Secure Enclave. That’s what encrypts your fingerprints and card information, tokenizing it rather than sharing it with apps and web-based stores. The Touch ID square is actually a button, though you don’t have to actually press it for your fingerprint to register, just rest it on top. Hold it down and it acts as a physical power button – it’s also how you can restart in the case of a system crash – though you rarely have to use it. Just opening the lid of the notebook boots/resumes it. In the process, Apple also removed the startup tone. I’m not entirely sure why that has prompted such an outpouring of sentiment, perhaps it’s port requiem overspill. Keyboard and Force Touch trackpad It’s not just down to the Thunderbolt 3 switch that helped Apple make the new MacBook Pro thinner: the “butterfly mechanism” keyboard played a part, too. It also triggered a few groans from those familiar with – but not a fan of – the keyboard on the 12-inch MacBook, which was Apple’s first play with the new mechanism. Happily for those skeptics, things are a little different second time around. Though I’m personally a fan of the MacBook keyboard, I can understand why some people struggle with it. Though the company points out that each individual key is more stable, travel is much reduced in comparison to Apple’s old ‘board. That takes some getting used to. On the MacBook Pro, travel is the same half-millimeter but the underlying dome switch is different. That may not sound like much, but it gives the keys far more “pop” as you strike them: it actually feels like they’re moving more than they really are. Side by side with the 12-inch MacBook, it’s a noticeable improvement. Just as the keycaps are larger on the new MacBook Pro, so the Force Touch trackpads have grown. On the 13-inch models it’s now around 6.25-inches diagonal; the 15-inch is even bigger, at a vast 7.25-inches. As we’ve seen before, they provide the sensation of a click even though it’s actually simulated – you can choose between light, medium, and firm sensations in the settings – which takes a little getting used to at first, but quickly becomes second nature. All that extra room makes macOS gestures easier, and there’s less swipe-and-lift involved in general navigation. I was a little worried about palm-rejection, given the size of the trackpad means there’s a reasonable chance some part of your hand or wrist might be resting on it at times, but Apple’s improved algorithms there have seemingly done the trick, and I’ve not noticed any issues. Its sheer size does make me wish that Apple had added Pencil compatibility for repurposing the trackpad as a graphics tablet. Battery After all the changes, Apple’s commitment to a promised 10 hours of battery life is one of the few carry-overs from the old MacBook Pro. That’s 10 hours of wireless web browsing, mind, or iTunes movie playback, both at 75-percent brightness. Actual battery size varies of course, though it’s interesting to note that, because it doesn’t have the Touch Bar to accommodate, the entry-level 13-inch has a slightly larger battery than its more expensive but identically-sized sibling. My own testing suggests that 10 hour figure is pretty accurate, and even too conservative by an hour or so. It’s very dependent on not only how much you’re stressing the system but what apps you’re using, however. If you’re a Safari user then you’re going to see much better results than if you prefer Chrome, for instance. Even if you’re just browsing, it can mean the difference of a couple of hours. Push things harder, such as doing 4K video processing, and you’ll spend far less time away from the outlet. It took 11 minutes for iMovie to export a 10 minute 4K video on the 15-inch MacBook Pro, for instance. During that time, the battery dropped by 10-percent. As for recharging, Apple supplies a 65W adapter with the 13-inch MacBook Pro, while the larger model gets an 87W adapter. There’s no extension cable – it plugs directly into your outlet – though you can buy one separately, and there aren’t the flip-out arms to wrap the cable around, either. Other USB Type-C devices, like Google’s Pixel phones, are happy to recharge from them too. Wrap-Up Has Apple forgotten the professionals which are arguably its most vocal advocates? I don’t think that’s true, though I do suspect that group now finds itself at the fringe of MacBook Pro users. Such is the side-effect of a user group in general expanding. Ergonomically, I’m among those still content with a non-touch primary display. My experience with the Touch Bar, meanwhile, has left me mighty curious to see what comes next as third-party developers get to grips with the potential of the added interface. Right now, a large part of its usefulness is in replicating keyboard shortcuts: that’s handy if you’re unfamiliar with them, but it’s no great surprise that longtime Mac users have been less wowed. That doesn’t mean there’s not plenty of potential for a small, full-color display that leaves your primary screen uncluttered and allows you to manipulate tools with one hand while you use the trackpad with the other. Just as Thunderbolt 3 needs time to gain traction, so the Touch Bar is dependent on third-party support and imagination to really come into its own. Life on the cutting edge is, inevitably, something of a gamble as you wait for everyone else to catch up. I can’t help but imagine a 2017 MacBook Pro with Kaby Lake processors and several months of developers getting to grips with the potential of Touch ID and the Touch Bar. As it stands today, though, the dongle frustration and the fact that you really need to pay $1799 or more – the entry-level 13-inch misses out too much, in my opinion, to be worth considering – are outweighed by the improvements in graphics, the excellent build quality, and the promise its unique hardware coupled with macOS represents.

The original won our Editors’ Choice award, impressing us with its excellent battery life, beautiful display, and slim dimensions. Now, with the release of Intel’s new seventh-generation Core processors, the XPS 13 has received yet another internal update. Our two new review models both pack the latest Intel chips into a rose gold finish that’s as trendy as it is eye-catching. Both configurations are significantly more than the $800 base model, but the low base price means the upgraded versions are still competitive with other high-end laptops. Our latest units were $1,149 and $1,649 for a Core i5 and i7 more, respectively. That includes a $50 charge for the new rose gold finish. So, does Dell’s XPS 13 still rule the ultrabook roost? Or have new alternatives like the HP Spectre x360 and Asus’ Zenbook 3 stolen the show? Small, yet big Opening the Dell XPS 13 immediately reveals its most prominent design trait: a barely-there display bezel. The gaps between the edges of the screen and the edges of the lid are less than a quarter of an inch thick, which means this notebook comes closer to a true “edge-to-edge” display than the competition. They also help the XPS stay small, as it’s only one foot wide and eight inches deep. That’s half an inch narrower than the new MacBook Pro 13. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Such compact dimensions may raise durability concerns, but touching this Dell crushes them without hesitation. The carbon fiber and aluminum chassis feels rigid. Even the thin-bezel display allows only the slightest flex. We feel confident the XPS 13 will handle abuse better than most systems of its size. The exterior of the standard, silver XPS 13 is mundane with the display lid closed. Dell could have done more to differentiate the system at a glance from the Inspiron 7000 series, which also relies on silver metallic accents. Dell’s gold and rose gold models resolve that issue with a subtle change of color. Once open, both models reveal a uniquely textured, soft-touch carbon fiber interior that steals the show. No other laptop looks or feels quite like this. USB 3.0 dominates, but USB Type-C 3.1 is included Wired connectivity is adequate. It offers two USB ports, both 3.0, along with a Thunderbolt 3/USB 3.1 Type-C port, which handles video and additional peripheral connections. The Dell includes a proprietary charger and charging port, but the Type-C port can be used to charge if you have a compatible charger lying around. An SD card reader and an audio jack are also included. There’s no Ethernet or HDMI – you’ll need adapters for those. You may not need Ethernet, though, because the base XPS 13 comes standard with 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0. Still one of the best Windows touchpads The small size of XPS 13 doesn’t mean the keyboard is rubbish. On the contrary, individual keys provide solid feel with reasonable travel and a firm bottoming action. A ton of space between individual keys leads to our only complaints. The key caps could be larger, and Backspace is too small. Still, it’s a top-notch effort overall, which makes maximum use of the minimal chassis. Upgrades like the 3,200 x 1,800 panel, and classy rose gold finish, only sweeten the system. Keyboard backlighting is standard. By default, it turns on only when the system is actively in use. Just two brightness levels are available, and a great deal of light escapes from beneath the keys, which can be distracting. A third, even dimmer setting would be preferable. We can’t praise the touchpad highly enough. Four inches wide, and a hair more than two inches deep, it’s not particularly large, but what it lacks in size it makes up for in fluidity. Multi-touch scroll and zoom feel wonderful, almost Mac-like, and we never had an issue with mistaken or unwanted input. The tactile left and right buttons integrated into the touchpad lack travel, but it hardly matters because tap-to-click works so well. Pleasing pixels The standard XPS 13 comes with a 1080p display, which was featured in the Core i5-7200U unit, while the Core i7-7500U version has a 3,200 × 1,800 touchscreen. That’s about 280 pixels per inch for the higher-end model, or 60 more per inch than a MacBook Pro. Predictably, that makes for a sharp viewing experience. While the display can’t do native 4K, there is a noticeable bump in image quality when viewing 1440p or 4K content. The 1080p model we recently reviewed had a non-touch matte surface, with a maximum brightness of 259 lux. That is less than most competitors, but the non-gloss surface makes the minimal backlight useable in almost all conditions. Its contrast reached 970:1 with the brightness all the way up, coming in ahead of the competition, but just barely. Color accuracy wasn’t as strong, at 2.65 – once again, not the worst reading, but with some room for improvement. Gamma was way off at 2.7, which means images appear darker than they should, with lost detail in the shadows. More: HP Spectre review The glossy 3,200 x 1,800 QHD+ display fared a bit better. Its 279 lux maximum brightness still doesn’t reach the 350 range which we see on most high-end displays, but will suffice for most use cases. Contrast is slightly lower than the 1080p model, at just 780:1 with the brightness all the way up, which falls further from the 900-1000 range we’re used to seeing. Its 2.0 gamma is a bit bright, but forgivable, seeing as even strong panels often fall just outside the ideal perfect range. Both displays look good, but in different ways. The matte-screen 1080p model is a better choice if you read or write frequently on your laptop, as the high contrast and non-gloss surface help documents pop. Movies and games look alright, but the poor gamma performance does obscure detail, leading to muddy scenes in some situations. The glossy, QHD+ display is the opposite. It’s not the best choice if you’re looking to read a document on a plane, as the mirror-like finish becomes annoying. But it does look more vibrant when displaying entertainment, espically when the laptop is viewed in a dim or dark room. There’s also a 1080p glossy model available on some models. We didn’t test it this time around, but we have in the past. Its performance is like the QHD+ version, so it’s a good choice if you want an entry-level XPS 13, and intend to use it to watch movies or edit photos. Audio performance is a flaw. The speakers don’t sound terrible, but they can’t output enough volume to fill a room with sound. External speakers or headphones are a necessity. Not the quickest, but quick enough We’ve reviewed a handful of XPS 13 configurations over the past two years, and the newest additions are the seventh-generation Intel options in rose gold. The higher-end model packs in the Core i7-7500U, while the more modest version has a Core i5-7200U. The seventh-generation focus wasn’t on performance, so the modest speed improvements aren’t too surprising. The Asus Zenbook 3 with the same chip beats the Core i7-7500U equipped XPS 13 in our Geekbench CPU test, but not by much. Importantly, both XPS 13 models take a lead over the previous generation’s top-end gold version with a Core i7-6560U. Our real-world CPU benchmark is more favorable to the Dells. Both the new XPS 13 models take a strong lead in our 4K video conversion test, even over other systems with stronger Geekbench scores. They’re only beaten by the previously mentioned Core i7 XPS 13. For some reason, our Core i5 model also beat out the Core i7 model, which is likely a thermal oddity. We’ve reached out to Dell and will update this post as more information becomes clear. Go with PCIe PCIe SSDs have become the standard in high-end laptops, and it’s no different here. The newest XPS 13 models boasted sustained read speeds of 1,285 megabytes per second, and sustained writes of 573MB/s. The XPS 13 is in league with the fastest, running neck-and-neck with Razer’s Blade Stealth and Apple’s MacBook. Competitors like the Toshiba Satellite Radius 12, which has a SATA hard drive, struggle to offer half the XPS 13’s read performance. Of course, you can order the lower-end XPS 13 with a SATA hard drive, but the move to a 256GB PCIe SSD is sure to make a difference. Let’s not play games Despite Intel’s best efforts to provide gaming-ready integrated graphics, it becomes clearer with every generation that they just aren’t cut out for it. The Core i7-7500U model of XPS 13 achieves a Fire Strike score of 882, better than most of its competitors, but not exactly an impressive score in the grand scheme of things. Meanwhile, the previous generation’s XPS 13 with a Core i7-6560U scores a slightly more palatable 1,271, thanks to its late-generation CPU with Iris graphics. The Core i5-7200U model performs very similarly in terms of graphical performance. Both chips are equipped with Intel HD graphics which, again, aren’t our favorite. They’ll be fine for some light Counter-Strike, or maybe even World of Warcraft if you aren’t too picky about quality settings, but that’s about it. Then again, you won’t often see systems this small, or inexpensive, with dedicated graphics. Dell XPS 13 (Kaby Lake) Compared To Toshiba Portege Z30-C1310 Asus ZenBook UX305 Toshiba Kirabook (2014) Asus Zenbook UX301LA HP Envy x2 Dell XPS 13 Dell XPS 12 ASUS Zenbook Prime UX32VD Sony Vaio S Premium 13.3-inch Lenovo ThinkPad X230 Toshiba Portege Z835 Asus U36Jc Sharp M4000 Toshiba Dynabook SX Sony VAIO C1MW PictureBook All day endurance The XPS 13 starts at 2.7 pounds, and the high-resolution touchscreen increases that figure to a still-light 2.9 pounds. That’s slightly heavier than other laptops in its weight class, such as the HP Spectre and Zenbook 3, but whether you’ll notice half a pound or not is up for debate. Though physical small, the Dell feels chunky in-hand. That’s an effect of the thin bezels. The XPS 13 is much smaller than other laptops sporting a 13-inch display, and thus denser. Despite how it feels, it’s one of the smallest and lightest 13-inch systems overall, and will easily fit in any backpack or bag designed to carry a typical laptop. Multi-touch gestures are smooth and accurate thanks to the brilliant touchpad. Battery life is strong. Dell has increased the capacity of the battery with each iteration, and it’s now up to 60 watt-hours. That’s among the largest batteries in any 13-inch laptop. Most are at 50 watt-hours, or less. In the Peacekeeper battery benchmark, the Core i7-7500U version of the XPS 13 lasted five hours and seven minutes. Our web browsing loop extended life to six hours and ten minutes. Our video test loop went even better, reaching just over nine hours on a single charge. That’s enough to cover a flight or a mixed load workday, but it falls short of systems like the Zenbook 3 and Spectre x360, largely due to a higher-resolution panel and more powerful CPU. The Core i5 model offers more endurance. The Peacekeeper browser test, for example, lasted six hours and 12 minutes – over an hour longer than the Core i7 version. In addition, that result bests all the competitors we’ve reviewed including the Asus Zenbook 3, HP Spectre, and Acer Swift 7. The lesson? While the 3,200 x 1,800 display is slick, you should stick with the 1080p model if battery life is your main concern. Warranty Dell ships the XPS 13 with its standard one-year “enhanced support” warranty. This is essentially the same warranty you’d expect to receive from any laptop. While it’d be nice to see a longer warranty given this model’s price, we can’t knock the company; few competitors bother to offer more than a year. Our Take Though this year’s updates aren’t the most exciting, Dell builds on an already successful computer with the revised Dell XPS 13. It remains our favorite laptop. Is there a better alternative? The thin and light laptop space has become even more crowded in the last year, but the XPS 13 still stands out as one of the best laptops in the category. The Zenbook 3 has made a splash, but its value isn’t as strong as the XPS 13, and it has a finicky keyboard. The Ideapad 710’s a nice machine as well, but lags behind the XPS in terms of performance and display. The DT Accessory Pack Logitech M510 Wireless Mouse $19.99 Anker Dual Display Universal Docking Station $94.99 Acer R240HY Monitor $119.99 Cyber Acoustics USB Powered Speaker $15.63 HP’s reimagined Spectre line has also challenged the XPS 13’s superiority, with the extremely thin Spectre 13 and convertible Spectre x360. They’re priced competitively too, and offer a solid alternative with a slick look. However, the Dell XPS 13 has a wider range of display options and more attractive, more portable design. How long will it last? Dell’s newest XPS 13 model checks off almost everything on our list for a future-proof laptop. It has Thunderbolt 3, plus two USB Type-A for legacy support, screen options over 1080p, the latest generation of Intel processors, a sturdy design, and a large battery. Should you buy it? Yes. If you’re looking for a new laptop, the Dell XPS 13 is our favorite laptop overall, and you’d be remiss to not at least consider it. The base models offers good value around for the price, and upgrades like the 3,200 x 1,800 panel and classy rose gold finish only sweeten the pot. The HP Spectre is probably the next best thing, if Dell’s offering isn’t quite doing it for you. The Spectre x360, specifically, provides a 360-degree hinge, while the Dell’s touchscreen only leans back so far. Otherwise, it’s easy to see the XPS 13 is the laptop of choice for most users.

Flash or disk, flash or disk. Let's do both – Seagate Portable drive, 5TB capacity. Hmm, there's something fishy here Profile Dani Golan stands on the roof of his Israeli headquarters and points out features of the scenery: an 8,000 year-old ruin here, an ancient trade route there, a modern highway alongside the building, a sign to Nazareth, and fighter jets taking off from a nearby airforce base with thunderous, sky-filling roars. Dani is founder and CEO of all-flash array firm Kaminari, and our guide to this portion of a press trip to look at Israeli startups. Golan founded Kaminario with Moshe Selfin and Ofir Dubovi in 2008 to make an all-DRAM grid-in-a-box array. It didn't take off, so they bailed out and switched to an all-flash array instead. Selfin was vice president for marketing and products, and left in August 2010 for Anobit, the flash controller company bought by Apple. He is now COO of Credorax. Dubovi was COO and CFO, and left in October 2012, and Golan became sole leader of Kaminario. Israeli rules ban photos showing pilot's faces with planes. So here is a silhouette of someone in an F16. Dani had been an IDF fighter pilot, one of the elite, flying his IAI Kfir jet or an F16 and managing missions. He didn't fly his jet from the air base near Kaminario's office, but every jet taking off from there will trigger memories of his 1990-1996 IDF days. In between streaking through the sky, Golan, married and with an infant child, studied electrical engineering ("because it was the toughest thing to do") as a mature student at the Technion university in Haifa. He gained a BSc degree, finished his air force service and went to work as an electrical engineer – not an exceptional one he says – at Intel. But being the kind of guy who likes challenges, he wanted to go way beyond designing better ways of using amps and volts. "The most fascinating thing in life is people. I wanted to combine the people aspect with technology," he says. Living in America Eager to learn how businesses work and run his own company, Golan decided to study business at the prestigious Kellogg School of Management in Evanston, Illinois. "I really wanted to study business at the best place in the world, and also get to know America," he says. Students on Kelogg's two-year exec MBA course are required to have a full-time job, so he persuaded Intel to move him over to the USA and brought his wife and child with him. Golan is a persuasive guy, always outlining a vision of how great it is going to be and arguing the logical necessity of it all. "Let me tell you why I believe that…" he keeps saying, with an obvious need for you to agree. He sees relationships as a full-time job, and everything is family. Kaminario is his work family, his backers are his funding family, channel partners are a reselling family, and Israel and its citizens are another, huge family. Golan believes people work for, invest in, sell to, buy from and care for people. He wants people to be believe in him and be successful with him, and is good at connecting with others. It's part of his talent, and sometimes almost overwhelming. For him, relationships are not a light matter. Dani gets the call While Golan was studying at Kellogg and working for Intel, he got a call from Moshe Yanai, ex-tank commander in the IDF, Technion electrical engineering graduate, helicopter pilot, EMC engineering wizard, vice president of the Symmetrix group and its product creator at Hopkinton. It was as if a storage deity had called after hearing about Golan from a contact in the IDF. Golan started working at EMC in July 2001*, doing software things; Joe Tucci had become EMC CEO in January 2001, after joining as president and COO in 2000. (Tucci replaced Michael Ruettger, the previous CEO, and then forced Moshe Yanai** out later in 2001, earlier having moved him into an advisory position.) Symmetrix technology had fallen behind the competition (in not using Fibre Channel, for example), and lower-cost CLARiiON (what became VNX) array sales and development hadn't been prioritised. Tucci started cleaning out EMC's stables in response to a severe revenue downturn as customers stopped buying Symmetrix arrays. Revenues slumped from $8.9bn in 2000 to $6.8bn in 2001. Cuts had to be made. About 10,000 staff were laid off out of a total 26,000. The blood-letting started in May, two months before Golan joined, with several layoff rounds in the next few months. Golan was lucky to be taken on when all this was going on. He gained an MBA from Kellogg in 2003 and moved into EMC's NAS IP business, reporting to vice chairman Bill Teuber in 2006 and working on strategy. You don't get to be a CEO without promoting yourself to others, and Dani says: "Joe Tucci noticed me and admitted me to the exec management team when I was a relative kid. He would always ask the opinion of junior people in the room. I told him he should invest in VMware." Performix move Then Golan got an offer to be the COO of Performix, a BI/workforce performance management company. He says he had long and painful discussions with people, including Tucci, before accepting. Performix had been acquired by Israel-based Nice Systems back in 2006, and Golan was involved in the Performix reshaping. This is where he got his operational management experience. A big problem Performix customers had was getting data off storage arrays fast enough. They had IO bottlenecks. Ofir Dubovi was a vice president and COO at Performix, and became the COO for Nice Systems in late 2006. So now we have two of Kaminario's co-founders working for the same business. Where did Moshe Selfin come from? At that time he was an international sales and business development leader at IBM, having joined from being a solutions director at EMC in September 2006. He managed IBM's Israel software-as-a-service (SaaS) programme. Dubovi, Golan and Selfin set up Kaminario together to fix the storage IO bottleneck problem. They based it in Israel in 2008, working out of the bomb shelter located on one floor of the current office building in Yokneam, north of Tel Aviv. Selfin is credited with inventing Kaminario's DRAM-based original K2 array. Dani Golan with his favourite inspirational quote Life is a serious business for Dani, beneath the sense of fun he promotes in Kaminario. He sets himself challenges and surrounds his staff with inspirational quotations and messages. One is Albert Einstein’s “Everything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler.” Kaminario CEO being persuasive Golan likes trying out new dishes in restaurants, learning new skills and mastering problems. He has a knack of focusing intently, as if pushing a lighthouse beam through a microscope – which can be unnerving if you are the item on the specimen slide. Golan treats Kaminario rather like a favourite toy. It’s going to be a truly great company, he is more than willing to explain. However long you give him, he will beam that lighthouse intensity into your brain and have you believing it too. ® * Footnote Doron Kempel, SimpliVity's CEO, headed a media solutions group at EMC from 1998 to September 2001. Kaminario's position as an all-flash array supplier is somewhat similar to SimpliVity's in the HCIA market: both are second to a larger, post-IPO former startup: Pure for Kaminario and Nutanix for SimpliVity. ** Footnote 2 A joke at the time was that EMC stood for “eventually Moshe’s company".

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases Cray XC40 “Theta” Supercomputer Accepted and in Production at Argonne National Laboratory SEATTLE and SALT LAKE CITY, Nov. 14, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — At the 2016 Supercomputing Conference in Salt Lake City, Utah, global supercomputer leader Cray Inc. (Nasdaq:CRAY) today announced it has achieved acceptance for “Theta,” the Cray® XC40™ supercomputer, as well as a Cray Sonexion® 3000 storage system, located at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF), a U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility at Argonne National Laboratory. The Theta system marks Cray and Intel’s first acceptance for a large-scale supercomputer featuring the latest generation of Intel® Xeon Phi™ processors formerly code named “Knights Landing.” Theta has a peak performance of more than eight petaflops, and is currently running a broad range of scientific applications through the ALCF’s Theta Early Science Program. The Cray XC40 system was delivered to Argonne National Laboratory through a partnership with Intel as part of the DOE’s initiative to build state-of-the art supercomputers through the Collaboration of Oak Ridge, Argonne, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (CORAL) program. “The Argonne Leadership Computing Facility is committed to providing advanced supercomputing resources, like the Theta system, that help our researchers solve some of the world’s largest and most complex problems,” said Rick Stevens, Associate Laboratory Director for Argonne National Laboratory. “We are pleased that Theta is now accelerating our scientific research.” Cray, in partnership with Intel, will also deliver a flagship system called “Aurora” as part of the CORAL program. Aurora will be based on the next-generation Cray supercomputer code named “Shasta,” the successor to the current, industry-leading Cray XC™ line of supercomputers. Aurora is expected to have a peak performance of 180 petaflops and is scheduled for delivery in 2018. “The acceptance of Theta is a significant milestone for Cray and Intel as we continue to work towards the installation and acceptance of several Cray supercomputers with the new Intel Xeon Phi processors,” said Peter Ungaro, president and CEO of Cray. “Our collaboration with Intel and Argonne is focused on producing powerful supercomputers for the DOE user community. The Theta system is exciting step forward in our partnership, and one that I know many other supercomputer centers around the world are watching as they evaluate this new processor technology for their next mission-critical system.” Cray is a leader in deploying supercomputers with the Intel Xeon Phi processors, and several top supercomputing centers have signed large contracts for Cray XC™ supercomputers with Intel’s new processor. These systems include the “Cori” system at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC); the “Trinity” system at the National Nuclear Security Administration; and the Cray XC40 supercomputer at the Academic Center for Computing and Media Studies at Kyoto University in Kyoto, Japan. “The Theta supercomputer at Argonne is an important step in the CORAL project and a milestone on the path towards the Aurora system,” said Dr. Rajeeb Hazra, Vice President of the Data Center group and General Manager of the Enterprise and Government group at Intel. “The combination of Intel’s leading technology, latest Intel Xeon Phi processor technology, codenamed Knights Landing, Intel Scalable System Framework, and Cray’s system capabilities is helping to drive scientific discoveries and engineering breakthroughs.” For more information on the Cray XC supercomputers and Cray Sonexion storage systems, please visit the Cray website at www.cray.com.

Eyes Above The Waves Robert O'Callahan. Christian. Repatriate Kiwi. Hacker. Monday, 14 November 2016 Handling Hardware Lock Elision In rr Intel's Hardware Lock Elision feature lets you annotate instructions with prefixes to indicate that they perform lock/unlock operations. The CPU then turns those into hardware memory transactions so that the instructions in the locked region are performed speculatively and only committed at the unlock. The difference between HLE and the more capable RTM transactional memory support is that HLE is supposed to be fully transparent. The prefixes are ignored on non-HLE-supporting CPUs so you can just add them to your code and things will hopefully get faster --- no CPUID checks are necessary. Unfortunately, by default, Intel's hardware performance counters count events in aborted transactions, even though they didn't really happen in terms of user-space effects. Thus when rr records a program that uses HLE, our conditional branch counter may report a value higher than the number of conditional branches that "really" executed, and this breaks rr. (FWIW we discovered this problem when Emilio was using rr to debug intermittent failures in Servo using the latest version of the Rust parking_lot crate.) For RTM we have some short-term hacks to disable RTM usage in glibc, and the medium-term solution is to use "CPUID faulting" to trap CPUID and modify the feature bits to pretend RTM is not supported. This approach doesn't work for HLE because there is no need to check CPUID before using it. Fortunately Intel provides an IN_TXCP flag that you can set on a hardware performance counter to indicate that it should not count events in aborted transactions. This is exactly what we need. However, for replay we need to be able to program the PMU to send an interrupt after a certain number of events have occurred, and the Linux kernel prevents us from doing that for IN_TXCP counters. Apparently that's because if you request an interrupt after a small number of events and then execute an HLE transaction that generates more than that number of events, the CPU will detect the overflow, abort the transaction, roll the counter back to its pre-transaction value, then the kernel notices there wasn't really an overflow, restarts the transaction, and you're in an infinite loop. The solution to our dilemma is to use two counters to count conditional branches. One counter is used to generate interrupts, and it is allowed to count events in aborted transactions. Another counter uses IN_TXCP to avoid counting events in aborted transactions, and we use this counter only for measurement, never for generating interrupts. This setup works well. It means that during replay our interrupt might fire early, because the interrupt counter counted events in aborted transactions, but that's OK because we already have a mechanism to carefully step forward to the correct stopping point. There is one more wrinkle. While testing this new approach I noticed that there are some cases where the IN_TXCP counter reports spurious events. This is obviously a nasty little bug in the hardware, or possibly the kernel. On my system you can reproduce it just by running perf stat -e r5101c4 -e r2005101c4 ls --- the second event is just the IN_TXCP version of the first event (retired conditional branches), so should always report counts less than or equal to the first event, but I get results like  Performance counter stats for 'ls':
         1,994,374      r5101c4                                                     
         1,994,382      r2005101c4 I have a much simpler testcase than ls which I'll try to get someone at Intel to look at. For now, we're working around it in rr by using the results of the regular counter when the IN_TXCP counter's value is larger. This should work as long as an IN_TXCP overcount doesn't occur in an execution sequence that also uses HLE, and both of those are hopefully rare.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 13, 2016 at 5:00PM For several years now, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been more actively building processor and platform technologies targeted at the very low-end of the personal computer market. These products are based on the company's low-power Atom architectures, rather than its higher-end Core processor architectures. Intel's Client Computing Group chief, Navin Shenoy, holding a processor. Image source: Intel.  At the company's 2015 investor meeting, now-former Intel personal computer chief Kirk Skaugen told investors that between 2010 and 2015, Intel gained approximately 10 percentage points of personal computer processor market share. A lot of that, the executive indicated, was due to Intel's renewed push in the low-end of the market. Intel now seems to be aiming to release new products for this market on an annual cadence to continue to bring new features and technologies to lower, high-volume personal computer price points. The product line that Intel currently offers for this market is called Apollo Lake. In late 2017, Intel is expected to launch a product for this market called Gemini Lake. Thanks to Michael Larabel with website Phoronix, we now have some preliminary information about Gemini Lake. This looks like an "optimization" of Apollo Lake Gemini Lake is going to be the third low-cost Atom-based personal computer processor family built in Intel's 14-nanometer technology, following Braswell and Apollo Lake. Braswell included a mildly enhanced version of the Silvermont processor core found inside the prior-generation Bay Trail product -- manufactured in a 22-nanometer technology -- along with a larger, more powerful graphics engine. Apollo Lake brought significant improvements to both the graphics processing engine as well as the main processor relative to Braswell. Gemini Lake shares much with the prior-generation Apollo Lake, according to Larabel. The fundamental graphics architecture of Apollo Lake, Larabel says, is the same "gen9lp" technology -- that is, low-power Intel ninth-generation graphics -- used in Apollo Lake. Although the full specifications of the chip haven't been made public, this information probably points to Gemini Lake as an "optimization" of the prior-generation Apollo Lake. What that would mean is that the processor core and graphics architecture will remain largely unchanged, with perhaps some very mild changes elsewhere in the chip. The main performance improvement is likely to come from Intel's using an updated, higher-performance variant of its 14-nanometer technology, known as 14-nanometer+. This should allow Intel to boost the CPU and graphics frequencies without raising power consumption, delivering better performance. 10-nanometer Atom in late 2018? It's likely that Gemini Lake will be the last Atom-based personal-computer processor family built in some derivative of Intel's 14-nanometer manufacturing technology. The next part, according to this code from InstLatx64, is known as Mercury Lake and will probably be manufactured in Intel's 10-nanometer technology. If Intel sticks to an annual product release cadence, then we should expect to see Mercury Lake arrive in the fourth quarter of 2018. Intel will have been in production on 10-nanometer technology for about a year at that point, so one can only hope that the technology will be mature enough, and therefore cost-effective enough, to support high-volume production of a chip design targeted at low-cost personal computers. The key for Intel is to make sure to not let up on improving product features and performance in this segment of the market; if low-cost computers fall significantly short of premium smartphones in these areas, then potential buyers of these computers might simply decide to move even more of their daily computing tasks to those phones. That would hurt demand for personal computers and ultimately hurt Intel. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

Auto Show All updatesGadgets and techHybrid and electric carsSelf-driving vehiclesUnveilings Self-driving vehicles Nov. 15, 2016, 12:00 p.m. Intel CEO calls for automakers to buddy up on self-driving safety features Paresh Dave (Paresh Dave / Los Angeles Times) Businesses don’t like to share proprietary information with competitors. But for the sake of consumer safety, the auto industry should open up some self-driving car data, Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said during a keynote address Tuesday. Automakers point to trying to make roadways safer as the biggest reason for developing self-driving vehicles. But getting the technology right requires refining software that analyzes radar, camera and other sensor data. The thinking goes that the more data considered, the better the algorithm, the safer the car, Krzanich said. How does a car react to a particular unsafe situation? The technical details of the response is the type of content Krzanich said the industry might want to gather in a central database. It should enable everyone to get the “fundamentals” right, he said, and companies individually can add redundancies and other safety measures that go above and beyond. It’s unclear whether his message will find a receptive audience as automakers wrestle with how to gather and store the increasing amount of of performance, environment and user information produced within vehicles. Krzanich noted that in the coming years, a million self-driving cars in operation will be — in terms of data production — the equivalent of adding 3 billion people to the world. Calling for data sharing is good for Intel because it offers technology for companies to store and share data online. It also could be good for the automotive start-ups that Intel’s investment arm expects to back with $250 million over the next several years. Access to the shared information could help those start-ups develop sensors and software much faster than they could working independently.

You can ask how far you’ve traveled and your pace, and your voice assistant "coach" will respond along with encouragement to keep going. The sunglasses are also outfitted with a bunch of sensors, including an accelerometer and gyroscope. They can also apparently detect pressure, humidity, and proximity.

Even after brushing aside the last-generation machines that are still for sale, the current offerings are confusing. Both 15-inch models come with the Touch Bar, but only two of the three 13-inch models offered do. That $1,499 non-Touch-Bar-but-still-in-the-new-skinny-case 13-inch MacBook Pro is what I'm typing on right now. It's a great little laptop. The screen is gorgeous, battery life is great and it's more than fast enough for what I need when I'm not in front of my 5K iMac. It's a weird machine, though. I'm sure Apple left the Touch Bar — and two Thunderbolt 3 ports — out solely to hit the price point, which is already higher than the model it replaces. My guess is that this MacBook Pro will either drop in price or be replaced in the future as the Touch Bar trickles down. Until then, it's in the ranks of some other modern-era Macs that were caught between other products or different eras of hardware design. Let's look at some other examples. Power Mac G4 (PCI Graphics) This initial Power Mac G4 — codenamed Yikes! — was based on the Blue and White Power Mac G3 that came before it. Apple basically took the G3's logic board and added the G4 to it. If that sounds a little weird, it's because it was. The Power Mac G3 (PCI Graphics) was a hedge in case the "real" Power Mac G4 — with AGP graphics, AirPort compatibility, a faster memory bus and more — wasn't ready in time. That ended up being the case, so Apple sold this PCI Graphics model as the low-end model, with the faster, totally re-worked AGP-based machines shipping a month or two later. By the end of 1999, the PCI Graphics model was phased out, making it the shortest-lived computers modern Apple has ever sold. Power Mac G4 Cube This is one of those Apple projects that very clearly existed because Steve Jobs willed it into being. It was an entire G4 computer, packed into an 8-inch cube, that was then suspended in a clear acrylic case. It's still one of the most beautiful objects I own. It sits on my desk to this day. That beauty came at a cost, however. The Cube didn't have the same dual-CPU setup that could be found in the Power Macs, and the machines suffered from several design flaws from case cracks to overheating. The biggest problem was that it was hard to know who it was for. It marked the first time Apple expanded its product line beyond the "Grid of Four" that Jobs had implemented when he came back to the company: It was far more powerful than the iMac G3s Apple was selling at the time, but not as fast — while being nearly as expensive — as the towers. As a result, it didn't sell very well and was "put on ice" in July 2001. In that press release Phil Schiller said, "Cube owners love their Cubes, but most customers decided to buy our powerful Power Mac G4 minitowers instead." Mac mini (Early 2006; Core Solo) While it's a story for a different time, the switch to Intel was one of Apple's finest engineering hours. Not only was it a smooth transition for end users, the first Intel Macs were solid machines. When the first Intel iMac replaced the iMac G5, and when the PowerBook was replaced with the MacBook Pro, Apple was able to keep the costs the same. The MacBook started in between the cost of the 12-inch and 14-inch iBooks, but the Mac mini saw a price jump from $499 to $599 when the G4 was replaced. There was a catch though. To get a decent Mac mini, it suddenly cost $799. Here's Jonathan Seff, writing at Macworld in 2006: ...it’s important to remember that the original $499 Mac mini lacked all but the basic features, including the now-standard AirPort and Bluetooth wireless options. Adding those features to an older Mac mini cost about $100. And that’s not even considering the new chip and faster frontside bus and RAM; the switch to Serial ATA hard drives; and the addition of Gigabit Ethernet and two more USB 2.0 ports (now four in total). And the $799 model costs $200 more than its predecessor, but includes a Core Duo processor and 8x dual-layer DVD burner. The cheap model goes down in history as the only Intel Core Solo Mac ever sold. Like my MacBook Pro, it seems like Apple had to compromise on the specs to hit a price point. I remember Mac users being pretty upset about it at the time; I know I was. Thankfully by the end of 2006, the base Mini was updated to include a Core Duo chipset ending this weird little footnote to the Intel transition. Late 2008 & Early 2009 MacBooks The white and black plastic MacBooks seemed ubiquitous for a long time. After several years — and in conjunction with the unibody MacBook Pros — Apple reintroduced the MacBook. This generation featured the same aluminum case, glass-covered display and expansive trackpad as the then-new MacBook Pros, but lacked the horsepower and FireWire 800 port seen on the Pros. With this redesign, the price went up, so Apple would soon announce another new MacBook that was sold as a $999 alternative. It was one last white plastic model, albeit one that was just as weird: It was technically a unibody machine, but the only one ever to be made of plastic instead of aluminum. Confusing days. Progress Always Means Weirdness Every transition in technology brings a period of time in which less-than-optimal decisions have to be made. Price, features and timelines are always at war with one another. Sometimes that means Apple ships computers that aren't everything they could be. Sometimes it means there are big delays between generations. Sometimes they just make the Mac faithful sad. Better days are often just around the corner. Probably. Tags: mac Join Now Like MacStories?

The company’s India data-centre business, which contributed $145 million (1 per cent) to Intel’s total Data Centre Group revenues of $14.5 billion in fiscal 2014, is expected to clock double-digit growth this fiscal. ‘Buzzing market’ “Asia is a buzzing market for our data-centre business, and India is a high growth-opportunity market for Intel, especially with the digital infrastructure build-out, which the government is driving, gaining momentum. Two years ago, Intel’s data-centre business globally registered 18 per cent growth, and last year, we saw 11 per cent growth in revenue. We expect to maintain double-digit growth rates in our data-centre business,” Prakash Mallya, Director - Asia, Data Centre Group, Intel, told BusinessLine. He said Asia is one of the fastest-growing data-centre markets not just for Intel, but for all companies that are in the business. As per an estimate of research firm Research and Markets, the global data-centre construction market is expected to grow from $14.59 billion in 2014 to $22.73 billion by 2019, at a CAGR of 9.3 per cent. At a time when the PC market is shrinking globally, the $60-billion chip maker is counting on data centre, its fastest growing and most profitable business, to drive its future growth. In the third quarter of the current fiscal reported last month, Intel reported a revenue of $15.8 billion, of which the Data Centre Group contributed $4.5 billion, recording 13 per cent sequential growth and 10 per cent YoY growth. Digital India While Mallya declined to mention the latest India revenues and growth rates of the Data Centre Group for the current fiscal, stating that it is company policy not to split region-wise revenue and growth numbers, he said Intel will be investing significantly in all the Digital India-related solutions, such as IndiaStack, UID and eGovernance 2.0, all of which represent huge workloads that the data-centre business will address. In an interaction with BusinessLine early last December, Diane M Bryant, Senior Vice-President and General Manager, Data Centre Group for Intel, had revealed that India revenues of $145 million in the data-centre business in 2014 would witness a 50 per cent growth in fiscal 2015, which would translate to approximately $218 million. According to Bryant, the Data Centre Group was expected to grow at 15 per cent CAGR globally, over the next five years.

It needs a win … badly. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified) Although Target stock is up 7% for the past five trading days, shares have yet to reclaim the ground they lost in response to rather pitiful second quarter — on a year-over-year basis revenues fell 8%, for a variety or reasons. Income fell nearly 10%. Same-store sales were down 1.1%. It’s not the direction the retailer was hoping to be headed into what could be a crucial holiday shopping season. Is there any chance Target stock could have stopped the bleeding between then and now? There’s always that chance, but there aren’t too many $40 billion companies that can turn on a dime. Target Stock Earnings Preview As of the last look, analysts collectively expect Target stock to report income of 83 cents per share on sales of $16.3 billion for its third quarter. Both would be down from year-ago figures of earnings of 86 cents per share of Target stock and a top line of $17.6 billion. 7 CEOs That Are Heading to the Chopping Block by 2018 The company itself had offered Q3 profit guidance of between 75 cents and 95 cents per share, but only added that same-store sales would likely be between flat and down 2% for the latter half of the year. Analysts, however, have posted more specific suggestions — they’re looking for a 1.2% decline in same store sales for the third quarter, and a 1.5% dip for Q4’s same-store sales figure. Target stock has topped analyst estimates more often than not since its fiscal 2014 (calendar 2013) lull, and has broadly grown the per-share bottom line. Bear in mind, however, that aggressive stock buybacks have greatly contributed to that growth. Actual net income has quietly been slumping for years, which doesn’t bode well for Target stock. 3 Keys for Target Stock Holders While in the end it’s always about the numbers, the figures Target produces are ultimately about the company’s initiatives and decisions. There are three keys to the results the retailer has been producing and will produce in the foreseeable future. Groceries: Target touted the expansion of it grocery category as the key to sales growth earlier in the year; the company was certain it could become the one-stop solution for consumers. So far though, no dice. A quarter ago the company was reporting that produce and meats were spoiling sitting on the stores’ shelves before they were bought. TGT vowed to keep working it, but with the impending exit of the grocery division’s chief, Anne Dament, that business is about to face a sizable disruption before being put on track.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Comments By Agam Shah Follow IDG News Service | Nov 15, 2016 4:42 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Windows PCs Computer Hardware Comments HP has been hoping that sleek, powerful hardware will lure Apple Mac aficionados to switch to its PCs, and now is aiming the new Z2 Mini mini-desktop at Mac Mini users. The Z2 Mini packs the computing power of a full-size desktop into a box that can be held in one hand. Starting at $699, it will be available worldwide starting in December. HP has been excelling in PC design, with innovative desktops like Pavilion Wave, a cylindrical desktop, and Elite Slice, a modular mini-desktop onto which components can be snapped. The 2.4-kilogram Z2 Mini can cram an Intel server CPU and discrete Nvidia GPU -- both of which have their own cooling fans -- into a tiny space while delivering screaming performance. The Z2 Mini could be an alternative for those looking to replace the aging Mac Mini, which hasn't received a design or hardware upgrade for years now. Apple has been abandoning the professional market and, for engineers and designers, the Z2 Mini is superior to the Mac Mini, said Jeff Wood, vice president of HP's workstation business, during a briefing. The idea that Apple is stepping away from the professional market was highlighted during the recent release of the MacBook Pro, which has innovative features like the Touch Bar. But it attracted criticism for using old Intel Skylake chips, and was widely considered more of a consumer than a business PC. Apple also hasn't upgraded its Mac Pro desktop since 2013, and workstations with Windows are filling that void. The new Windows workstations have superior processors, GPUs, memory and SSD storage. The Z2 Mini is targeted at engineers and architects using applications like Autodesk or Solidworks. However, it isn't meant for use with VR headsets like Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, an HP spokesperson said. Nvidia's Quadro M620 GPU isn't designed for VR, and headsets typically need full-powered desktops like the Z840 with cutting-edge GPUs. The Z2 mini-desktop can be configured with Intel's Xeon E3-1200v5 CPU, or Core chips. It supports up to 32GB of memory and up to 1.5TB of storage. An entry-level model will have three DisplayPort ports, two USB 3.0 ports and an Ethernet port. A fully loaded model will have two additional USB Type-C ports. But some features are missing. It doesn't have an HDMI port to attach displays, or a Thunderbolt 3 slot to attach high-speed storage. Workstation users dealing with high-end graphics need more than 1.5TB of storage, and the USB 3.0 port, with its data transfer speed of 10Gbps (bits per second), may not be enough. Storage devices attached to a Thunderbolt 3 port -- which transfers data at 40Gbps -- can be used in real time, much like internal storage.  The Z2 can be mounted behind a monitor so it remains hidden.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Reportedly working on Digital Glasses Supporting Telephony and Augmented Reality | Main | Apple Wins 61 Patents Today Covering Future iPad Pro Accessories including a High-End Dock/Pivoting Stand and more » November 15, 2016 Apple Granted a Patent for a Sports Version of Apple EarPods   Back in 2014 Intel introduced a next-generation of music earbuds that were designed for runners and sports enthusiasts. The new earbuds introduced biometrics that could monitor a user's heartbeat and more while being controlled by their digital assistant called "Jarvis." Of course Apple had such an invention going all the way back to their filing in 2008. That invention has now been granted a patent. Another site reporting on this today mistakenly said that Apple's invention would work with Siri, but the invention doesn't support spoken commands whatsoever. The invention does however support head-gestures to control this next-generation of EarPods. The "wireless communications" noted in the report is in context with communicating with the monitoring system on an iPhone or iPod, not verbal communications.   Apple's newly granted patent 9,497,534 covers their invention relating to a monitoring system that could be placed proximate to the head or ear of a user. According to one embodiment, the monitoring system can be used with a hearing device, headphones, earbuds or headsets. The monitoring system could, for example, be used to monitor user activity, such as during exercise or sporting activities. The positioning of the monitoring system could also facilitate sensing of other user characteristics (e.g., biometric data), such as temperature, perspiration and heart rate.   Apple's patent states that the new sports oriented EarPods would be convenient for users than having to use a monitoring device in running shoes like the Nike+iPod system.   The added feature unique to this next-generation of EarPods, should it come to market, is that the user would be able to control some functionality using head gestures. Apple's patent notes that "receiving head motion data pertaining a head motion of a user of the electronic device; determining whether the head motion data matches any of a plurality of predetermined head gestures; and identifying an action associated with the matching predetermined head gesture. Additionally, the method can further operate to perform the identified action on the electronic device."   While Apple could always add Siri to the mix, it's not supported in this particular patent in its claims or otherwise.   Although some of the patent claims were updated over the years, the original 2008 patent application that was published by USPTO in 2010 was covered in our original report titled "Apple Reveals Advanced Sports Monitoring and Head Gesturing Systems." Check out our original report for more details.   Patently Apple presents only a brief summary of granted patents with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each Granted Patent is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any Granted Patent should be read in its entirety for full details.

Tech News Downloads Software Store Search for: BetaNews Hot Topics: Windows 10 Microsoft Apple Cloud Tablets Android Security Reviews Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Linked-in RSS Lenovo ZUK Z2: Promising smartphone, with a few caveats [Review] By Desire Athow Published 2 months ago 6 Comments Tweet Lenovo is already a well-established brand in Western Europe thanks to its personal computer brand which counts the legendary ThinkPad range and German manufacturer, Medion, amongst its ranks. It also absorbed storage vendor Iomega, IBM’s Intel-based server business and NEC personal computer range. The company has acquired phone manufacturer Motorola, inheriting yet another iconic brand whose name still carries a lot of value for a mainstream audience. But the latest move of the Chinese company, which is also the biggest PC vendor in the world, has been surprising. It launched a division called Zuk, which is a Chinese-only brand, apparently aiming to compete with the likes of OnePlus (a subsidiary of OPPO), Honor (a subsidiary of Huawei) and Xiaomi. Gearbest sent us the Zuk Z2 which is its latest addition to its portfolio, one that goes head to head against the Honor 8 and the OnePlus 2. The phone costs just under £200 including delivery; we would suggest that you read this piece about the pros and cons of buying technology from online Chinese retailers (links to our sister website, TechRadar). The Design No surprise there, ZUK uses the same sort of design that you’d find on premium models. Indeed, the phone has an air of iPhone 5 about it, with an entirely black finish. It sports lean lines and a minimalist design with dual 2.5D Arc glass front and back sides. As a business phone, the ZUK will have no problem displayed next to the latest high-end smartphones on the market. Not a hint of plastic here. The software is an entirely different story; more on that later. Glass is a premium material, but suffers from three big disadvantages. It is fragile (despite what Gorilla Glass will say -- note that the phone doesn’t use GG), it does attract fingerprints and it has a nasty tendency to slide on smooth surfaces (which often ends with a big thump when it hits the floor). To Lenovo’s credit, it seems that it used an oleophobic coating to make the rear and the front less greasy. The front fascia contains the speaker, a front facing camera as well as a physical home button that hides a few tricks. Just below that, on the shorter sides, is the headset input, the USB Type C connector and the speaker grill. On the side is the power button, the volume rocker and the SIM card holder. There’s no micro SD card slot -- the phone comes with 64GB by default -- and two nano SIM cards, both on standby, can be supported. At the back is a small ZUK logo -- no mention of Lenovo -- a single flash and the camera sensor. ZUK says that it used metal particle coating on the sides to enhance the phone’s look; what that means is that it makes it look matte. The Hardware The phone’s dimensions -- 8.5 x 142 x 69mm -- are great for whoever is not a big fan of phablets; ditto for the weight which tops the scale at only 149g. Bear in mind that it has a smaller than average 5-inch display, coupled with a full HD resolution, though, it does produce sharp pictures. More on that later. As for most of the high end vendors -- and unlike many of its tier-2 Chinese competitors which have opted for Mediatek chip -- the Zuk Z2 uses a Qualcomm one, the Snapdragon 820, a beast of a processor that runs four cores at up to 2.2GHz and has an Adreno 530 GPU. As expected, it supports 802.11ac, LTE (all UK 4G bands except Band 20/800MHz), LPDDR4 and Bluetooth 4.1. There’s also an array of sensors including a gyroscope, a compass, a hall sensor, a proximity sensor and a light one. As mentioned before the ZUK Z2 comes with 64GB onboard storage; note that the phone uses the slower eMMC 5.1 technology rather than the faster -- but more expensive -- UFS 2.0 one. The rear camera sports a 13-megapixel sensor from Samsung while the front one is an 8-megapixel model. Both have fairly wide apertures (f/2.2 and f/2.0 respectively). And the rear camera can shoot at 4K. The smartphone also came with a USB Type C cable and a tiny adaptor with a Chinese plug, but one which delivers far more juice than your average charger. It’s rated 2.5A at 5.3V which equals 13.25W or almost a third more than a standard mobile power adaptor. Sadly, there’s no NFC capabilities which is simply unacceptable on a phone in this category. This short-range, low power connectivity mechanism has become more popular and omitting it automatically excludes it from some use case scenarios like Android Pay. In Use As expected, the components in the ZUK Z2 deliver a stellar performance; it blazed through the popular Antutu mobile benchmark, delivering a superb score of 140,058 which is within spitting distance of the leader, the OnePlus 3. The display uses the LTPS technology, probably from Sharp (now Foxconn); that’s a similar display used by the Apple iPhone 7. The pictures look crisp even in broad day light with an average contrast and excellent brightness. Colors are not too saturated and looked natural with excellent viewing angles; out-of-the-box options to tinker with the display settings are limited though. As expected -- thanks to a pixel density of 441PPI -- the icons and texts remained sharp. The sound quality is one of the few weak spots; the mono speaker failed to deliver the oomph and reach the highs of devices like the Sony Xperia Z3 which deliver sound through two front facing speakers. Audio quality remains a recurrent issue with Chinese smartphones. One bright spot though has to be the fingerprint reader which can be configured and is not only fast (100ms response time) but also unobtrusive. The hardware only tells half of the story: bear in mind that this is a smartphone for the Chinese market so the installed firmware indicates that. We encountered Chinese characters when trying to update to the latest version of the OS (2.1.059 ST). Sadly, that didn’t go as planned and is symptomatic of the sort of experience you encounter with devices that are not location-optimized. We had to install a VPN to download the most recent firmware update as ZUK’s servers wouldn’t allow anyone from outside China to do it. And even then, we couldn’t install it because the phone was apparently encrypted (we couldn’t find any option in the settings to disable it). Furthermore, although the ZUK Z2 came with Google Play, most of the other Google services (Youtube, Gmail etc) were not installed by default. At the time of writing, there’s no English version of the ZUK website which means no official support (you can always rely on unofficial third party user forums, but at your own risk). As for the battery life, it was excellent. The 3,500mAh battery managed to keep the phone running for almost two days, albeit without any intensive tasks (no Youtube or gaming involved). Verdict Clearly, using this phone is not for the faint hearted. The number of hoops you need to go through to get an OTA (over the air) update is frightening and highlights the gulf that exists between established brands like Huawei or Samsung and those -- which, like ZUK -- aspire to match them. Obviously, Lenovo has no excuse to fall back on. The OTA experience should be much better than that even if it is a smartphone destined for the Chinese market. There’s also the lack of NFC which puzzled us as much as it disappointed us. And, while entirely subjective, the use of glass at the back instead of metal or plastic means that the phone is more likely to be scratched especially as it slides more easily on any surface with a gentle slope. Ours got a few scratches within 24 hours. Sure, a protective sleeve or case would help, but then doesn’t that negate the purpose of having a glass back in the first place? That combined with the fact that it doesn’t support band 20 (800MHz) makes it a no-no for O2 customers whose LTE service uses this frequency exclusively. MVNO customers from Giff Gaff, Tesco Mobile and Talk Talk are also in the same boat. In the end, the ZUK Z2 is a prime example of a phone that could certainly become a hit, but will probably have to be sidelined until the major issues highlighted before are solved.

A website started by three Chennai-based professionals is helping students across India overcome the English language barrier to learn programming, and to launch their careers in the field of information technology.Even as English continues to be a popular language in our country, it is still not the first language for many students, often acting as a deterrent to these students’ professional growth. Now, a website called GUVI (Grab Your Vernacular Identity) is helping them learn programming and specific computer languages in vernacular languages. View photos guvi4More GUVI provides video tutorials, college courses, assignments, and practice papers to students who aspire to build careers in the field of information technology, and does so in English and vernacular languages, currently Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada.

But we were disappointed to see that things were actually worse. While the infrastructure had improved, the amount of exposure students received to the outside world remained the same. So we wanted to do something about it,” Arun Prakash recollected. Dealing With the Language Barrier View photos guvi1More “One thing that stood out was the fact that there were many talented students, but they were held back by the language barrier. Their sparse knowledge of English made it difficult for them to follow lessons, particularly those related to computers,” said Arun. The trio returned to Chennai and began thinking of ways to help these students. Soon, GUVI was born, initially just as a YouTube channel. “We started a YouTube channel and started uploading instructional videos in vernacular languages. For instance, if you wanted to learn coding or programming in your native tongue, you could do that,” said Arun. The channel soon had over 4,000 subscribers and more than a million views. Many students from Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities wrote in, letting them know that the videos had a positive impact on their lives. This motivated the founders and they decided to quit their jobs to launch an official GUVI platform that would make available mentors, practice material, and job opportunities. A One-Stop Solution [caption id="attachment_75105" align="aligncenter" width="710"] The founders[/caption] Arun had 14 years of experience in the IT industry, and had worked with Symantec earlier; Balamurugan and Sridevi had worked with PayPal. Leaving behind this cushioned corporate life, the three of them registered GUVI in November 2014. Soon enough, the start-up received a chance to work with the QEEE project, which aims to teach the Python programming in 150 colleges in India in local languages. In order to utilise GUVI, students must create their accounts on the website, and in turn, they gain access to most of the videos free of cost. Students who opt to sign up for special packages, advanced courses, practice assignments, etc., have to pay fees ranging from Rs. 800 to Rs. 3,000. All the videos are made by industry professionals who work in the particular technology field. “If it is a video about Android programming, a developer who has some six years of experience in the field makes it, or provides a voiceover for it. The content is made only by experts who have hands-on knowledge,” said Arun. GUVI has courses on programming (from the beginner to expert levels), databases, web development, and mobile development.

When we were doing only videos, we got requests to include some theory lessons and exercises for students to practise. So we included those. Soon, start-ups began to approach us about hiring our students, so we set up a recruitment channel,” said Arun. Changing Lives with Every Click View photos guvi2More Today, GUVI has over 40,000 users, of which 10,000 users pay for the advanced courses. Students with little knowledge of English or with no background in programming can simply use personal computers to log on to the portal and learn using the available instructional videos. They can also use the various learning exercises to hone their skills. Their performance in these exercises is reflected in a ‘profile’, which is used as a resume by prospective employers to assess their skills. The platform also gives reward points to users who practise and finish their courses, which is again visible on their performance profiles. Arun estimates that at least 30,000 students have benefitted from the portal and are now proficient in computer programming. They use PCs to practice what they learn and are equipped with the right set of skills for different jobs. “The pay package these students attract is anywhere between Rs. 2.5 lakh to Rs. 12 lakh annually, depending on their skills and the field. Given that many of these students are first-time graduates from their families, it’s a huge step forward for them.” Murgan is a GUVI student who comes from a family of daily wage earners. Every day, after college and even during the weekends, he used to help his family members with their work to earn a living. A smart but shy student, Murgan didn’t have good communication skills. Once he enrolled himself with GUVI and developed his skills using a PC, Arun and his team recommended him to a company, asking the employers to test him on his technical skills and not just his ability to speak in English. Murgan got the job and has been the star performer in his company for three years now. View photos guvi6More GUVI has a core team of nine people and an extended team of experts to help with content creation. The team also works with colleges in Chennai and Coimbatore so the latter can purchase their content and let their students use it for practice. This helps spread the word about the website too. Arun is proud of the fact that the widespread reach of GUVI has helped many talented girls gain access to a platform where they can learn, practise, and challenge assumptions about their expertise. “Once, a hi-tech startup company was hiring from GUVI. Many people assume boys are better at programming than girls. But we shattered this stereotype during the hiring process when the first person selected for the job was a girl. This is a platform where girls too come and showcase their skills and this is mainly because they find role models here. One of these is a girl who we mentored and who now works as a developer. She says if it were not for GUVI, she would have been married and without a job by now,” said Arun proudly. GUVI has made knowledge that is useful to many students seeking careers in the IT industry, accessible, regardless of their linguistic backgrounds. With hard work and dedication, there is no reason that they cannot go forward, rise in their careers and fulfil their untapped potential.

Login Search Tech Stock Roundup: AAPL Upgrade, GOOGL-EU, BABA Singles Day November 14, 2016, 03:04:00 PM EDT By Sejuti Banerjea, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo The election was the biggest event last week, easily blotting out everything else, especially because of the surprise President-elect. But that didn't stop a hot Apple AAPL rumor from KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo; or Alphabet's GOOGL defense of its Android ecosystem; or the gangbuster Singles Day numbers from Alibaba BABA . So read on… Apple May Not Upgrade iPhone SE KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo is famous for breaking Apple product-related news. This time, he's saying that the company may not refresh the budget iPhone "SE" line next year. The rationale is purportedly to boost demand for the more expensive and higher-margin iPhone 7, while also pressuring SE component makers to reduce prices. This pressure may increase because Apple is now selling refurbished, certified iPhones from its online store. The iPhone SE is a very competitive and lighter phone, especially if you can make do with a smaller screen and 64GB storage, don't mind a somewhat weaker front camera and more limited water resistance, and also really want the headphone jack. The analyst feels that not refreshing the SE, weaker China demand and lower 4.7-inch volumes will impact iPhone sales next year. He forecasts an iPhone shipment volume decline to between 35 and 40 million (40.4 million units were shipped in 2Q16). He also has reservations about component price declines. Google Defends Android Google has its rival Yandex to thank for this one, as the leading Russian search engine's (until it was displaced by Google) complaint to the Competition Commission precipitated proceedings. In 2013, Google rivals Microsoft MSFT , Nokia and Oracle ORCL had gone to the EU through an umbrella organization called Fairsearch. But it was hard to pin Google guilty, leading to the case dragging on. But when in Russia, Google required phone makers to pre-install Google search (just as everywhere else) instead of Yandex, the company went to court. In this case, the EU is investigating 3 angles as Techcrunch pointed out so well- that Google is allegedly "requiring and incentivizing" smartphone and tablet manufacturers to exclusively install its own services, and in particular its search engine that it is allegedly bundling certain Google products with other apps & services whether Google is hindering the ability of smartphone and tablet makers to use and develop other OS versions of Android (aka Android forks) If found guilty, Google will have to pay up to 10% of revenue, or around $7.4 billion. The crux of Google's response of more than 100 pages is that Google's practices are with a view to prevent fragmentation of the platform without which Android would be weakened and competition would in fact be impaired. It says that the Commission's decision to omit Apple as a competitor appears arbitrary and partisan. It makes no sense because the Commission's own survey revealed that 89% of respondents consider Apple and Android as competing platforms . Besides, it allows the Commission to conveniently ignore the fact that 39 out of 39 pre-installed apps on iPhone 7 are from Apple, and 39 out of 47 pre-installed apps on the Microsoft Lumia 550 are from Microsoft. Android has allowed phone makers to bring cheaper phones to the market and has helped millions of app developers. A weak platform would be bad for everyone. In the words of Kent Walker Google's general counsel, "The response we filed today shows how the Android ecosystem carefully balances the interests of users, developers, hardware makers, and mobile network operators. Android hasn't hurt competition, it's expanded it." Alibaba Singles Day Alibaba had a record Singles Day with sales of $17.79 billion, up from the record $14.3 billion last year and short of the $20 billion analysts were projecting. But these sales are nothing to scoff at: 2015 sales in the U.S. on Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined and from all stores (both online and offline) totaled $19.4 billion. This year, Singles Day moved across the border, with the top markets for Chinese goods being Russia, Spain, Israel, Ukraine and France. Top markets selling to the Chinese were Japan, U.S., South Korea, Australia and Germany. The most popular brands were Apple, Nike, New Balance, Siemens, Philips and Adidas. Around 37% of shoppers bought from international stores with virtual reality creating new experiences like Chinese customers browsing the isles of Macy's store in New York without ever leaving their seats. But clouds are looming for Alibaba with the election of Donald Trump. The company's business hinges on China-U.S. relations, so it will be negatively hit by Trump's decision to charge a heavy tax on Chinese goods. If the Chinese government reacts with similar duty on U.S. goods, Alibaba will be affected very badly. The other concern is with respect to its accounting practices, particularly with respect to its Singles Day sales, for which the company is being investigated both in the U.S. and in China.

Adam Mosseri, VP of product management at Facebook says, "In Newsfeed we use various signals based on community feedback to determine which posts are likely to contain inaccurate information, and reduce their distribution. In Trending we look at a variety of signals to help make sure the topics being shown are reflective of real-world events, and take additional steps to prevent false or misleading content from appearing. Despite these efforts we understand there's so much more we need to do, and that is why it's important that we keep improving our ability to detect misinformation." The company earlier formed an alliance with various media houses for similar reasons although the possibility of potential business partners colluding to suppress or misinform the public for vested interests is a bit unsettling. Singapore Civil Service Chooses Facebook Workplace : Singapore's civil service is adopting the Facebook Workplace platform for its pool of 143K (and growing) public servants by March 2017. The platform is inexpensive at just a dollar per user per month for groups larger than 10K people, so it's a good deal for Facebook as well. In fact, this is the first deal of its kind for Facebook and underscores the platform's popularity in Asia. Legal/Regulatory Irish Finance Minister Will Go to Bat for Apple : The EU Competition Commission has determined that Apple owes taxes to the tune of $14.5 billion for illegally transferring profits generated in Ireland to a titular head office in a tax free zone. Irish Finance Minister Noonan says that the Commission is acting out of its jurisdiction because tax is a matter decided by individual countries and the competition angle is just a back door to meddle in the member nation's internal affairs. The tax breaks enjoyed by Apple are part of state aid that some European countries resort to with the objective of attracting investment in the region. Apple has around 6K employees in Ireland. In September, the cabinet approved Ireland's joining Apple in appealing the EU's demand, and Noonan submitted his appeal last week. LinkedIn Banned in Russia : The professional network faces a ban in Russia because of a law passed in 2014, requiring websites storing personal data of Russians to store it in servers within the country, says Russia's Roskomnadzor communications watchdog. LinkedIn reportedly has 6 million users in the country, so it could be a near-term blow. However, the problem may not be long-lived given its pending acquisition by Microsoft. Amazon Refunds for In-App Purchases : A federal judge has ruled that Amazon AMZN must take the responsibility of informing and then refunding parents, when their kids run up bills related to unauthorized in-app purchases. While judge Coughenour agreed with Amazon that the $26.5 million decided by the FTC was too high, he ruled out lump sum payments and gift cards for the amount as Amazon would collect profit on goods sold through gift cards. In similar dealings, Apple and Google coughed up around $32.5 million and $19 million, respectively. Unauthorized purchasing has been curtailed however, with the help of improved controls since then. New Technology/Products Pre-Owned iPhones Now on Sale : Last September, when Apple introduced the concept of iPhone annual upgrades and AppleCare+ for $32 a month, I had speculated that they wanted to build inventory of phones on which manufacturing cost was already recovered to target emerging markets like India. But competitors protested this in India, so Apple needed a Plan B (which may have also been in the works actually). With the anniversary up, Apple would be receiving these phones about now. So it is selling these refurbished (new battery and outer shell) phones after testing and certifying them at a 15% discount through the app store and making a huge profit. Apple is reportedly selling eight versions, all with a one-year warranty. The decision is also of great strategic importance as it could prevent users from moving away to cheaper phones from competitors. It's also a way for Apple to further expand its user base, enabling it to sell more services. The current rates are $399 for the 4GB model, which sells for $499 at full retail and $499 for the 8GB model, which sells for $599. Facebook App for Emerging Markets : Facebook is determined to eat Snapchat's lunch and the leading social network is doing about all it can to replicate Snapchat-like features such as Instagram stories, "secret" (erased after some time) conversations and more. Now it's launched Flash, a Snapchat-like platform targeted at emerging markets like Brazil, Indonesia and India where the Facebook brand name is very well recognized. This may cap Snapchat's progress in emerging markets while strengthening Facebook versus this picture-sharing networking platform. Intel's New Chip Tech : Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland has called out Intel's high-speed, in-package optical interconnect silicon photonics technology as a product with the capacity to "revolutionize the semiconductor industry". As the analyst says, it will definitely mitigate the effects of a slowing Moore's law by reducing the interconnect time between Intel's Xeon Server CPUs and Altera's FPGAs, i.e. until Intel integrates the technology into a single piece. The analyst also said that Intel has "proof of concept" chips and is looking to improve current low production yields. This could lead to a commercial product just three to five years down the line. Rolland estimates that data transfer rates may start at 50 to 100 gigabits per second with the new chips, but could increase to a half terabit or 2 terabits by early next decade, he said. Google, Apple App Store Updates : Both Google and Apple have huge app marketplaces, which might make it difficult for developers to reach buyers. The two companies are therefore always looking for ways to help developers get their apps seen. Google had many encouraging announcements such as a) allowing developers to offer limited-time discounted subscription pricing for their apps b) a promise to expand the Google Play Store to wearables, VR headsets, and Chromebook laptops for easier distribution from a single marketplace and c) a decision to employ machine-learning algorithms more heavily to provide app recommendations for Google Play users. Apple, which earlier this year promised developers a bigger revenue share and more reviews for new apps, announced that they can now create early-access promotional codes for new apps that can be offered to journalists and reviewers. These should help them generate more publicity for their new apps and in-app purchases. Some Numbers Google Home vs. Amazon Echo : IHS Markit says that Google Home will solidly beat Amazon Echo by 2020, shipping 5.4 million units that year, while Amazon will be stuck at 2.4 million units. Amazon does have a first mover advantage right now, but it will evaporate over the years as Google uses its treasure trove of data to more fruitfully apply artificial intelligence according to the research firm. Apple is also expected to join the fray with a device based on Siri. The Google device is fifty bucks cheaper at $129, but lacks Amazon's skills (app ecosystem). This should be a very short-term hurdle as Google has the wherewithal to more than catch up here. NVIDIA Results : NVIDIA reported solid results this past quarter with its adjusted EPS of 83 cents far outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents on the back of solid revenues that also beat our expectations by a wide margin.

By John Gruber Archive The Talk Show Projects Contact Colophon RSS Feed Twitter Sponsorship The New Touch-Bar-Equipped MacBook Pros and the State of the Mac Monday, 14 November 2016 I think there’s been a lot of confusion over the nomenclatural transition Apple is going through in its MacBook lineup. Back in 1998, Steve Jobs presented a simple four-quadrant lineup for Apple’s entire Mac line: a consumer notebook (iBook), pro notebook (PowerBook), consumer desktop (iMac), and pro desktop (Power Mac). No one could be confused by the difference between an iBook and a PowerBook. The PowerBook was more expensive, faster, had a better display, and even used more “serious” design language — iBooks were candy-colored and the PowerBooks were matte black. Much has changed since then, including all those product names (except for the iMac). About midway between then and now, Apple introduced what I believe to be the best-selling Mac notebook in history: the MacBook Air. At the time the Air was introduced in 2008, Apple’s other notebooks were the “regular” MacBook and the MacBook Pro. Sound familiar? The MacBook and MacBook Pro played the exact same roles as the iBook and the PowerBook. One was significantly less expensive, and accordingly, not as nice. Plastic vs. aluminum, slower vs. faster. I used a white iBook for several years. My wife used a white MacBook for several years about a decade ago. These were good notebooks and I remember them both fondly. But the only reason we bought those machines was that we couldn’t or didn’t want to spend the money for a PowerBook or MacBook Pro. The PowerBook “pro” alternative to my old white iBook was one of the most ahead-of-its-time designs Apple has ever made: the 12-inch PowerBook G4. Just look at it. It’s thick and heavy by today’s standards, but it foretold much of Apple’s aluminum-era design language. I wanted one badly, but couldn’t justify the price difference compared to the iBook, especially for what was going to be a secondary machine. One notebook that was slower but cheaper. One notebook that was faster and more expensive. The MacBook Air didn’t fit into this matrix at all. It was slower than the regular MacBook but as expensive as a MacBook Pro. What you were paying for wasn’t “power” but instead right there in the (then utterly perfect, today somewhat confusing) name “Air”: remarkable thinness and lightness. Apple moved from the names PowerBook and Power Mac to MacBook Pro and Mac Pro when they shifted from PowerPC to Intel processors. At the time, I chalked this up entirely to wanting to distinguish the Intel-based machines from the “Power” in “PowerPC”. In hindsight, though, I think it also signified a subtle shift in Apple’s design priorities for its very best computers. For decades, computers were starved for raw performance. CPUs were slow, RAM was scarce, disks were slow (and unreliable), graphics were slow. Printing was slow. Networking was slow. Everything was slow. And the more money you spent, the more you could alleviate these problems with faster components, and more ports and peripherals. Just about everyone agreed the original MacBook Air was beautiful to behold and that something so light and thin would be nicer to carry around than something thicker and heavier. But many critics thought Apple had lost its goddamn collective mind by breaking the rule that you spend more money on “faster”. From EveryMac’s page describing the differences between the original MacBook Air and the then-current regular MacBook: Upon viewing the respective specifications pages for the original MacBook Air and a “regular” MacBook at the time the original MacBook Air was introduced — the MacBook “Core 2 Duo” 2.4 13” (Black- Early 2008), for example — two users might come to very different conclusions. A style-conscious user might view the MacBook Air as sleek and beautiful and the “regular” MacBook as comparatively clunky. A cynical user might instead view the MacBook Air as half the system for twice the price. Both of these viewpoints could be legitimate. Most would agree that the MacBook does look rather “clunky” compared to the MacBook Air. Likewise, there is no denying that the MacBook Air does have substantial limitations compared to the “regular” MacBook in performance (it’s slower and uses the same lackluster integrated graphics), connectivity (it only has one USB 2.0 port and no onboard Ethernet, compared to the “regular” MacBook with two USB 2.0 ports, a Firewire “400” port, Gigabit Ethernet, and optical digital audio in/out), and expansion (no swappable battery or upgradable RAM and it is a pain to upgrade the hard drive, compared to the “regular” MacBook which has a swappable battery, upgradable RAM, and it is relatively simple to upgrade the hard drive). The “regular” MacBook also has a convenient internal optical drive whereas the MacBook Air requires the usage of an external one or software workarounds. Costs more. Not faster. Fewer ports. Fewer user-replaceable components. Sound familiar? MacBook Air buyers were paying a premium not for performance (or to use the old word, power) but instead for niceness. Apple effectively bifurcated the premium side of the MacBook lineup: Air for niceness, Pro for performance. But then a funny thing happened. MacBook Airs got steadily faster and cheaper. Moore’s Law at work. The regular MacBooks went away, and eventually the 11-inch MacBook Air dropped to $899, and the more popular 13-inch Air to $999. The MacBook Air transitioned — not in one fell swoop, but slowly and steadily, year after year — from being a premium product to being Apple’s most decidedly consumer-oriented Mac. The go-to Mac for students, casual users, and the budget-conscious. Last year Apple reintroduced the no-adjective MacBook brand for a device that was thinner, lighter, had a better display, one single expansion port that doubles for charging — and came at a premium price. Oh, and it’s quite arguably slower not just than the old MacBook Airs that are still sitting there in Apple’s lineup, but also slower than an iPhone. The regular MacBook’s value proposition today is exactly what the Air’s was in 2008. The MacBook Air’s value proposition today is exactly what the MacBook’s was in 2008. They’ve flipped. But the Air is the device whose name implies “thin and light”. Here’s what I wrote back in May: The outrage is coming from people who want Apple to update the MacBook Airs with retina displays. That’s not going to happen. The Airs are now Apple’s low-priced models. The Pros will get thinner (and thus more Air-like) and the new MacBook will get faster (and thus more Air-like). But the MacBook Air as we know it serves only one purpose: to hit the $899/999 price points. Back in March 2015, after the debut of the current one-port MacBook, I wrote: The key to understanding the new MacBook is that it didn’t replace any existing models in Apple’s lineup. In fact, the 11- and 13-inch Airs and the 13-inch MacBook Pro all got speed bump updates last week. If you need more ports or better performance, or if you frequently need to work while your MacBook is plugged into a power outlet, this machine is not for you, today. That’s why it didn’t (yet) replace anything in the lineup. The original 2008 MacBook Air was slow, expensive (based on specs), lacked storage, only had one USB port, was the first Apple notebook without an optical drive, etc. It was not for everyone. It was not for most people, in fact. But some people loved it. The new 2015 MacBook is the same thing — some people will love it today, and it shows us Apple’s vision for the future of the notebook form factor. So forget about the word Air. Apple’s vision for computers — notebooks, phones, tablets, even desktops — is thinner and lighter. Everything Apple makes today is an Air model in spirit. The name “Air” is no longer meaningful. My Thoughts on the New MacBook Pros I’ve spent almost three weeks testing a few models of the new MacBook Pros: the 13-inch model that lacks the Touch Bar, a mid-range (Core i5) 13-inch with the Touch Bar, and a 15-inch model with the Touch Bar. By way of comparison, my personal MacBook is a top-of-the-line 13-inch MacBook Pro that I bought just about exactly two years ago. As I’ve used these new models, the thought I keep turning back to is this: What Apple means by “pro” is tied very much to being nicer. A rundown of details and observations: The build quality is decidedly nicer. This is particularly noticeable with the display hinge. It feels better when you open it, it moves smoother as you adjust it to your preferred angle, and it closes with a more satisfying snap. iFixit’s teardown contains some interesting observations about how Apple achieved these improvements. Space gray looks amazing. I wish it were even a little darker, but it’s very cool. In very bright light, it doesn’t look that different from the traditional silver finish. In darker lighting, though, the difference is very noticeable. The trackpad is excellent. I enjoy that it’s bigger, and Apple’s palm detection has worked perfectly. Not once has it gotten in the way. The reduction in bezel area surrounding the display is noticeable. The combination of device thinness, bezel reduction, and the space gray finish all serve to make my previous MacBook Pro look old. The keyboard is, for me, a mixed bag, and it’s probably the one thing that many people will like least about these machines. I find less key travel to be less pleasant while typing. But I’m so far out there on this issue that I use a 20-year-old Apple Extended Keyboard II, with mechanical key switches, at my desk. I’ve never liked any notebook keyboard compared to an actual mechanical keyboard. But every time Apple makes its keyboards thinner, I get used to it. I always do, and I’m already pretty used to these new ones. And here’s the mixed bag part: the new MacBook Pro key switches do have a premium feel to them. I now can’t stop noticing how much the key caps on my old MacBook Pro jiggle around when I’m just resting my fingers on the keys. The new keys don’t do that. It feels like a premium keyboard — just one with incredibly short key travel, alas. [Update: Is the new MacBook keyboard too loud?] The keyboard change I’m having the most trouble with is the arrow key arrangement. Starting with the 2015 new MacBook, Apple has made the left and right arrow keys full-height; previously all four arrow keys were half-height, in an upside-down T arrangement. I’m having a devil of a time getting used to this. I use those keys frequently and do so without looking at them, and my fingers just can’t find what they’re feeling for. I’ll get used to it, I suspect, but this is one of the few things I’d change if I could. I like the Touch Bar a lot, especially Touch ID. It also feels like the right way to do a keyboard for the emoji age.1 I’m still not entirely used to it, and I’m unsure how best to use it to suit my needs. What I’m sure of is that the wrong way to think about the Touch Bar is to expect it be to be a game-changing input method. It’s just a modern, dynamic replacement for a fiddly, static set of cryptic buttons. And it’s really nicely done. It looks less like a screen and more like a button bar with dynamically changing labels. It took about three days using Touch ID on this review unit before I instinctively tried to use it to unlock my old MacBook. Typing my login password now feels archaic. The Esc is the one button in the classic function key row that some people really use a lot. I’ve heard from them. “How’s the Esc key?” is the number one question I’ve gotten from readers about the Touch Bar. For some reason, the Esc key doesn’t sit flush with the left edge of the Touch Bar. It’s inset by about the width of a key. (My best guess is that it is inset for visual symmetry with the Touch ID sensor on the other side, but it’s possible there were engineering constraints.) But about half of the blank area at the left edge is touch sensitive, even though there is no display under that part of the bar. I made a brief video about this that shows it better than I can explain it. The bottom line is that it’s pretty easy to hit Esc accurately without looking — the team that made the Touch Bar was clearly aware that some people really do use the Esc key a lot. My main wish for the next-generation Touch Bar: Taptic Engine support. Fake clicks like those on the Magic Trackpad, or even like the iPhone 7’s 3D Touch haptics, would be great. This might be trickier for Apple to pull off than I’m imagining, though. The trackpad has better haptics and works with much less pressure from your fingers, but the trackpad doesn’t have a display. The iPhone has a display, but 3D Touch on the iPhone takes more pressure to activate than I think a keyboard button should. This might take a few years. I miss MagSafe. I think what it gets down to is that Apple sees the future as being battery-only while using it. Charge it like your phone — overnight — and then just go all day. And I also see the beauty in having just four USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports that all work the same way. But boy, MagSafe sure was a great idea, and it will be missed. (Even leaving aside the “trip over the cable accidentally scenario”, MagSafe is great on a daily basis just because it’s so effortless to connect. It feels like a cable that connects itself.) Speaking of battery life, it has been amazing. I watched Game 7 of the World Series with the 13-inch Touch Bar-equipped model open on my lap, for following Twitter and messaging a few friends about the game. It was a long game, over four hours, and I had the brightness on the display set as high as I wanted. (Maximum brightness would have been way too bright.) When the game ended the MacBook Pro still had 70 percent of its battery remaining. That’s probably the definition of “light use”, but my two-year-old MacBook Pro never got that much battery life under similar conditions. It is almost criminal that the extended power cord is now a $19 peripheral, and not included in the box. These machines cost upwards of $4,000 and they’re going to nickel-and-dime you over a power cord? Nickel-and-dime move number two: Not including a USB-C to Lightning cable with the iPhone 7. You can walk into an Apple Store today and drop thousands of dollars on a new MacBook and iPhone, but you can’t connect the two without a $19 cable (which will cost $25 again come January). I don’t know if this is a nickel-and-dime move or just a design decision, but the wall charger no longer has flip-out arms for wrapping the cable. That was a great little thoughtful detail, and I miss it. As promised, sound is way better from the built-in speakers. There’s almost no comparison. Where the Mac Stands Within Apple To me, an iPad in notebook mode — connected to a keyboard cover — is so much less nice than a real notebook. And the difference is more stark when compared to a great notebook, like these MacBook Pros. There are advantages to the tablet form factor, but no tablet will ever be as nice as a notebook as these MacBook Pros. I also prefer MacOS over iOS for, well, “doing work”. I think I’m more productive on a Mac than I am on an iPad. I can’t prove it, but even if I’m wrong, the fact that I feel like it’s true matters. I always feel slightly hamstrung working on an iPad. I never do on a Mac (at least once I’ve got it configured with all the apps and little shortcuts, scripts, and utilities I use). There are a lot of Mac users who feel the same way I do, and these new MacBook Pros have debuted at a time when many of these users look at Apple’s laggardly update pace for new Mac hardware (including the 1,000-plus day-old Mac Pros) and have come to the conclusion that Apple is sunsetting the Mac. They think Tim Cook really does want them to switch to an iPad. I think these new MacBook Pros, and the Touch Bar in particular, stand as refutation to that. These are very nice machines, designed and made with great care. And the Touch Bar is clearly no afterthought. A lot of teams from across the company worked for a long time on this. It’s an embedded iOS device, with the accompanying characteristics you’d expect: 60 FPS animation, seemingly instantaneous touch latency, well-done animation as things like the Control Strip expand and retract, and more. The Touch Bar is also, clearly, a costly component, making the Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pros more expensive. Price aside, the new MacBook Pro with the old-school function keys shouldn’t exist. But the Touch Bar won’t be expensive forever. It’s just so clear to me that these machines share the design ethos of the original MacBook Air. They’re designed for the future — the near future, I think — but until then, we’ll buy compatibility dongles and wait another year to see versions that support more than 16 GB of RAM. There’s much griping about these machines now, just like there was much griping about the original Air then, but these are exactly the MacBooks I want Apple to be making — ones that show that the company is putting very hard work into every aspect of them. I’d be more worried about Apple’s commitment to the Mac if they did the easy thing — easier both technically and in terms of initial critical response — and just stuck a retina display in a MacBook Air and called it a day. I do wish my most-used emoji characters synced across my various devices through iCloud, the way my keyboard text substitutions do. It seems weird that every device I use has a different set of most-used emoji. ↩︎ Previous: On Hiding vs. Encapsulating Complexity, in the Context of Twitter’s Experimental Reply Interface Display Preferences Copyright © 2002–2016 The Daring Fireball Company LLC.

By the time the closing bell rang, the S&P 500 was at 2,164.20, down a mere quarter of a point from Friday’s last trade. It could have been worse, though, and for owners of Puma Biotechnology Inc (NYSE:PBYI), Dynavax Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:DVAX) and Petroleo Brasileiro SA Petrobras (ADR) (NYSE:PBR), it was worse. These three names ended the session deep in the red, although for understandable reasons. Petroleo Brasileiro SA Petrobras (ADR) (PBR) Take your pick of reasons Brazilian oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA Petrobras — you know it better as just Petrobras — sold off in a big way today. There was more than one. The biggest unspoken reason PBR ended the day down 1.6% today was another meteoric rise of the U.S. dollar. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced another 0.95% (a huge move for currency) on Monday in step with another surge in U.S. interest rates. In that crude oil prices are priced in U.S. dollars, even for foreign oil companies, a rising dollar works against oil company profitability. 7 CEOs That Are Heading to the Chopping Block by 2018 Fanning the bearish flames that burned PBR on Monday was a lackluster third-quarter earnings report. Although that bad news came out before Friday’s open and took a toll then, the bears weren’t done yet. The oil giant booked a $5.05 billion loss. Much of that was a one-time loss, but not enough of it was to let PBR remain unscathed on Monday. Dynavax Technologies Corporation (DVAX) If you thought the 1.6% hit PBR took on Monday was rough, that’s nothing to the sucker-punch that shareholders of Dynavax Technologies suffered today. DVAX plunged 65% after the Food and Drug Administration rejected its ballyhooed hepatitis B vaccine Heplisav-B. Dynavax Technologies still feel Heplisav-B has a future. CEO Eddie Gray commented: “The CRL is consistent with our opinion that Heplisav-B is approvable and we are seeking to meet with the FDA as soon as possible. However, the time and resources that will be required to gain approval leads us to consider that we may not be able to advance this program on our own and we are moving swiftly to identify a potential pharmaceutical or financial partner.” The market, however, clearly isn’t as optimistic, sending DVAX shares to its lowest levels since 2008. Puma Biotechnology Inc (PBYI) Last but not least, DVAX wasn’t the only biopharma name to be up-ended by bad news regarding one of its drugs on Friday. Puma Biotechnology was also whacked in response to reports that its breast cancer drug neratinib. Like Heplisav-B, neratinib is not yet on the market. It’s currently being reviewed by the FDA. Although there has been no word yet from the FDA, Puma in the meantime disclosed that it will need to add a second anti-diarrhea agent to the therapy. That addition may well make it even more difficult to approve the drug. The 20.4% tumble PBYI took today, however, may have more to do with the fact that some attorneys are already planning class-action lawsuits, which will claim the company failed to adequately disclose all the potential risks to neratinib’s approval. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Back in 1993, Intel’s new Pentium chip turned out to not be very good at math, fouling up certain division problems past the eighth decimal point. NASA lost an incredibly expensive probe back in 1998 because someone forgot to convert pound-seconds into newton-seconds, causing the $125 million space vehicle to crash into Mars’ atmosphere too fast. Then Apple had a little SNAFU of its own back in 2012, when its Maps app led us down nonexistent roads or insisted we drive off nonexistent bridges. Last month there was an even more epic failure, which wasn’t any one company’s fault so much as an across-the-board lack of foresight. On October 21st, New Hampshire-based Dyn came under a massive distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attack, taking down a host of sites like Netflix, Twitter and the New York Times. Unless you’re an IT professional there’s no need to worry if you’ve never heard of Dyn, but it provides domain registration services and basically acts as the internet’s phone book. When you type in a web address, your browser basically checks it against Dyn’s directory to make sure it’s going to the right place. While Dyn is generally pretty fast – there’s a barely perceptible moment between hitting enter on that web address and the site popping up – on that day thousands, and maybe even millions (there’s no real way of knowing) of address checks starting coming in every second. The sources of those requests were pretty familiar; your printer, your security camera, baby monitors; pretty much anything that was “connected” could have been complicit in the attack. You can thank the Internet of Things (IoT) for that. IoT-enabled devices make our lives much easier in a lot of ways, allowing us to keep track of what’s going on at home when we’re away or control our environments to just to name a couple. Because the benefit of a connected device has to be weighed against factors like size, ease of use and power consumption, security can be lacking and, if it is there, either rudimentary or impossible to use. This particular attack appears to have been accomplished using a bit of malware called Mirai. Mirai basically scans the internet for connected devices that use 62 common default username and password combinations and, when it finds them, takes them over. That creates a “botnet” of compromised devices, which then bend to the hackers will. There’s understandably a push to improve the security of IoT devices but, again, there’s a fine line to walk. For security to improve, the technology itself really needs to improve. While you could say it’s too little, too late – with billions of devices already connected and more being added every day – I’m not sure that’s something to quibble about. Anything is better than nothing. Of course where there’s a problem, especially in technology, you can be pretty certain there is someone looking for a solution. I started looking for companies that are working on IoT security and, while I didn’t come up with any “pure plays” that are publicly traded, I came across about a dozen startups. For instance there’s SecureRF in Connecticut, that is developing a cryptographic technology to protect devices that communicate by radio frequency. Or Rubicon in San Francisco which is working on two-way authentication between IoT devices and the cloud. Then there’s Boston-based PWNIE Express which aims to protect pretty much everything IoT. None of them are quite ready for the Big Board yet, but even before the October attack they had collectively attracted tens of millions of dollars in venture capital funding. Now that the vulnerability has been clearly demonstrated, I definitely expect the pace of investment to pick up and, eventually, those VCs are going to want to cash in. Needless to say, I’m going to be watching for IoT security IPOs and I don’t think it’s going to be a very long wait.

Microsoft's Hybrid Device Likely To Outshine The iPad Pro 2 (Photo : Andrew Burton/Getty Images) If recently surfaced reports are anything to go by, Microsoft Surface Pro 5 release date is just around the corner. Advertisement Despite lack of an official announcement, there have been plenty of hearsays indicating that the highly anticipated gadget will hit the stores in 2017. With Black Friday approaching, bevies of deals are now being offered for quite a few devices. Meanwhile, more and more reports have advised consumers to ignore the deals for Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 citing the imminent launch of its successor, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5. Multiple reports suggest that the Redmond based tech firm is gearing up to launch a hybrid device geared with Intel's much awaited Kaby Lake processors. In fact, Microsoft Surface Pro 5 release date was reportedly pushed back from late 2016 to early 2017 in order to coincide with the launch of Intel's latest processor. If this comes to fruition and the Surface Pro 5 comes equipped with the latest Kaby Lake chips, this will propel the gadget far beyond than rest of its competitors, especially the Apple iPad Pro 2, which rumors claim is likely to arrive early 2017 as well. Besides, the Windows 10 Redstone 2 operating system is also slated to arrive in early 2017. Under the hood, the Surface Pro 5 is rumored to come with 16GB of RAM, coupled with Intel's Kaby Lake processor. The device is likely to boast the Nvidia Pascal GPU card as well, and pack a robust battery equipped with USB-C support, according to iDigitalTimes. In terms of storage capacity, the Surface Pro 5 will boast a mammoth 1TB of storage. If these speculations proved to be true, the device will outshine Apple's 12.9-inch iPad Pro that currently tops at a considerable 256GB of storage and 4GB of RAM, according to Inquisitr. Advertisement It's worth noting that there is possibility that the iPad Pro 2 would continue running on iOS, which is a mobile operating system. This could be one of the biggest drawbacks of the device and is likely to give the Pro 5 an upper hand as compared to its competitor. © 2016 Auto World News, All rights reserved.

Perhaps more interestingly, the switch to AMD provides expanded external display support that desktop users have patiently waited for. As Andrew Cunningham at Ars Technica explains, AMD's Polaris-based Radeon Pro 450, Radeon Pro 455, and built-to-order Radeon Pro 460 GPUs in the new 15-inch MacBook Pro support up to six displays, whereas Intel's integrated GPUs affixed to the logic board can drive a total of three displays. The expanded support enables the new MacBook Pro to drive two of Apple and LG's new UltraFine 5K displays at 60Hz simultaneously. Intel's GPUs can't because, due to bandwidth limitations of the DisplayPort 1.2 spec, the two 5K displays technically function as four displays. This method is known as Multi-Stream Transport (MST). When you hook one of LG's 5K monitors to one of the new MacBook Pros, what you're actually seeing on the screen is two pictures stitched together to make a single seamless image. This is because the version of the DisplayPort spec supported by Intel's GPUs and almost all monitors these days—version 1.2—doesn't have enough bandwidth to drive a 5K display at 60Hz all by itself. […] Apple is actually pushing two DisplayPort 1.2 streams to the monitor over the single Thunderbolt 3 cable. There’s nothing wrong with this method, except that it cuts down on the number of external displays your computer can support. Intel’s integrated GPUs can drive a total of three displays, but you use up two of those three streams to drive one 5K monitor and one of them to drive the laptop’s internal display. AMD’s GPUs support up to six displays, so you can use two of those connections for one 5K monitor, two of them for the other 5K monitor, one for the laptop’s internal display, and still have one left over for yet another monitor if you really wanted to use one.Apple could have used Nvidia's faster Pascal-based GPUs, which support DisplayPort 1.3, but Thunderbolt 3 and most monitors do not support the higher-bandwidth spec yet. In the meantime, Nvidia's GPUs can only drive up to three displays beyond the main MacBook Pro screen — not enough for dual 5K displays over MST. Apple will have more flexibility again when DisplayPort 1.3 becomes more common. Those future laptops will be able to drive two 5K screens plus a laptop’s internal screen using just three DisplayPort streams instead of five. For now, though, if pushing two high-end 5K screens at once was a design goal for Apple, AMD was the only way to go.In terms of performance improvements, Cunningham benchmarked the mid-range 2.7GHz 15-inch MacBook Pro with the Radeon Pro 455 graphics chip to determine just how much faster the notebook truly is compared to the 2016 12-inch MacBook and older MacBook Pros released over the past few years. He found the Radeon Pro 455 to be a "significant boost" over the built-to-order dedicated GPUs available in the 2012-2015 MacBook Pro models, namely the Nvidia GeForce GTX 650M, Nvidia GeForce GTX 750M, and AMD Radeon R9 M370X respectively, but said the new MacBook Pro remains unsuitable for high-end gaming and VR. Is it disappointing that Apple didn’t decide to push the envelope a little more? Sure. Is it too bad that performance and power efficiency were apparently sacrificed in the name of external display support? Yes. Are these midrange GPUs in any way inconsistent with any MacBook Pro released in the last decade? No.Apple officially says the 15-inch MacBook Pro offers up to 130% faster graphics performance, and up to 2.5x more computing power per watt, compared to the previous-generation 15-inch MacBook Pro, but those stats are based on the built-to-order Radeon Pro 460 chip that costs between $100 and $200 extra.

That's onscreen test. In offscreen test Radeon Pro is much faster than previous gpu. According to Ars Technica, 2016 Macbook Pro is rendering at 3360x2100 by default instead of 2880x1800. Offscreen: Rating: 29 Votes tebruno99 2 days ago at 10:57 am Imagine this. A crappy video card is much much faster than a previous crappy video card when only compared to the crappy video cards Apple chooses. These cards are 100x less crappy than the crappy choices of last gen, Yay! Nevermind its still high end GPU computing performance of 2008 just in a smaller package. Thanks Apple!

[doublepost=1479149816][/doublepost] How is that perspective? It's a desktop GPU. Unless you're talking about the 1080M, in which case you're looking at a laptop that's only portable on wheels. And just for perspective, the 2012 Cray Titan outFLOPs a dual Xeon workstation. there is no 1080m all current gen laptop have desktop gpu in them. since the 16nm gpu is efficient enough to be not cut back like all the previous gen. so hes not wrong when he say to put in perspective. Rating: 18 Votes avanpelt 2 days ago at 10:39 am Ok, so we'll add this "pro" to the list of cons. Rating: 18 Votes keysofanxiety 2 days ago at 11:11 am Sorry, I didn't realize that for you a 17" 0.88" thick 4k computer weighing 7.8 pounds was only portable on wheels for you. I thought it was a pretty light and sleek machine for a 17" when I saw it. http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-systems/razer-blade-pro Yeah, that already weighs more than the 2011 17" MBP (6.6 pounds). Let alone thinness and battery life. Great argument. Let me be blunt, since a lot of people really don't understand this: historically, Apple portables have prioritised thinness, battery life, design, performance, and specs. In that order. Nothing is new. Nothing has changed. What you have quoted is the complete antithesis of what an Apple portable is. Windows laptops have always had better specs. Better CPUs, better GPUs, more RAM, bigger screens — this isn't anything new. For what the new rMBP is, which is the best spec/weight/thinness compromise, it again is unmatched in the industry. Part of the trouble with the naysayers is that they completely ignore history. It doesn't much help them if they want to sound like they know what they're talking about. Rating: 15 Votes pgiguere1 2 days ago at 10:41 am Crazy how the Radeon Pro 455 is barely faster than the Iris integrated graphics. Wouldn't Iris Pro graphics be just as fast, if not faster than a Radeon Pro 450 then? Makes me wonder why they'd waste money/battery life on discrete graphics if they don't really provide anything on the base model. Rating: 13 Votes keysofanxiety 2 days ago at 10:55 am Just for a little perspective, the GTX 1080 does T-Rex at 1190fps (windows and DirectX). How is that perspective? It's a desktop GPU. Unless you're talking about the 1080M, in which case you're looking at a laptop that's only portable on wheels. And just for perspective, the 2012 Cray Titan outFLOPs a dual Xeon workstation. Rating: 12 Votes theitsage 1 day ago at 01:17 pm "Up to 2.5x more computing power per watt" is the carefully chosen marketing bs to disguise the overall GPU performance was not a significant improvement. The top of the line GPU in a Late 2016 MBP is slower than a $100 budget GPU RX 460.

This is a sea change from a year ago when the U.S. clearly led the pack with 200 supercomputers, followed by China with 108, Japan at 37, Germany with 33, and both France and the UK having 18 of these big systems. The supercomputers are also growing more powerful. The total sustained computing capacity of all the 500 computers on the list is now 672 petaflops, a 60 percent increase from a year ago. One petaflop is one thousand trillion floating-point operations per second. The U.S. leads in aggregate performance, calculated using the Linpack benchmark, but only marginally at 33.9 percent of the total, with China right behind at 33.3 percent. TaihuLight, capable of 93 petaflops on the Linpack benchmark, had particularly drawn attention because it was built entirely around processors that were designed and made in China.  In June it unseated the top-ranking Tianhe-2 supercomputer, another Chinese computer that had a score of 33.9 petaflops and had led the list of supercomputers for about three years. Installed at the National Supercomputing Center in Wuxi, TaihuLight used 40,960 SW26010 processors each with 260 cores, unlike the Tianhe-2 which uses 260,000 Intel Xeon E5-2692v2 12-core processors. The move was seen as a bid by the country to reduce its dependence on foreign processor technology in critical areas after the U.S. banned the supply of Intel Xeon chips to four Chinese supercomputing research centers. Intel continues to be the major chip supplier for supercomputers with its chips in 462 of the top 500 systems. The share of rival AMD is falling, with its chips figuring in just 7 systems on the current list, down from 13 systems six months earlier. IBM's Power processors have been designed into 22 systems. Hewlett Packard Enterprise, following its acquisition of SGI, now has 140 systems on the list, followed by Lenovo with 92 systems. Cray had 56 systems but leads all vendors in the aggregate performance of its supercomputers. The top 10 list has seen two new entrants, both built around Intel’s Xeon Phi 7250, a 68-core processor codenamed Knights Landing, that delivers 3 peak teraflops of performance. The Cori supercomputer, a Cray XC40 installed at Berkeley Lab’s National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, bagged the number 5 slot with a Linpack rating of 14 petaflops. Following it at number 6 is the new Oakforest-PACS supercomputer, a Fujitsu Primergy CX1640 M1 cluster, in operation at Japan’s Joint Center for Advanced High Performance Computing, which recorded a Linpack score of 13.6 petaflops.

(Flash90) Newsroom Email the Newsroom Facebook Twitter Related Topics Isaac Herzog Amona West Bank outposts Opposition leader MK Isaac Herzog refused to back down Monday on his use of a contentious term when speaking about a bill that would legalize unauthorized West Bank settler outposts, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded he apologize for his comments. The spat was triggered after Herzog, during an interview with Army Radio, said that an ongoing legal saga surrounding a key outpost was a “virus” that endangers Israeli democracy. It was initially unclear from his statement whether Herzog was referring to the settlers, the outpost, the larger settlement enterprise or the legislative effort as a virus, in part because his interviewer talked over Herzog when he quoted a verse from the Ethics of Our Fathers (Pirkei Avot), “… were it not for the fear of its authority, a man would swallow his neighbor alive,” which refers to the chaos that ensues when the rule of law is absent. His comments drew an almost immediate backlash. Later, Herzog specified he had been referring to the government’s legislative battle over the outpost with the High Court. Herzog’s voice was the latest in a string of condemnations against the bill, which aims to stave off a demolition order against the Amona outpost and other illegal settlements, since a panel of ministers gave it a green light Sunday. His use of the term “virus,” though, raised hackles in a country sensitized to the use of medical terms to demonize others, due to its echoes of Nazi propaganda about Jews. “I can’t believe that Herzog used the phrase ‘virus’ in relation to the settlers,” Netanyahu wrote on his Facebook page. “They are flesh of our flesh, they serve in the IDF, contribute to the state. Boujie, apologize immediately,” he added using Herzog’s nickname. During a weekly meeting in the Knesset of the Zionist Union faction, Herzog responded by insisting his comments referred to the so-called Regulation Bill, not the settlers themselves. He also claimed he has become Netanyahu’s “new target for incitement and hatred.” The prime minister’s claim that he had term the settlers a virus, was a false accusation, Herzg said. Zionist Union leader Isaac Herzog leads a faction meeting in the Knesset, November 07, 2016. (Miriam Alster/FLASH90) “Netanyahu, this time it won’t work,” Herzog said at the start of the meeting. “The Regulation Bill is the virus, a dangerous virus to the legal and democratic system.” Herzog added that while he “feels the pain” of the Amona residents, the court order must stand. In a tweet, Herzog added that “the settlers are my brothers and I will care for them more than you lie to them.” The storm was sparked Monday morning when Herzog went on Army Radio to slam the bill, which is also opposed by Netanyahu and the attorney general. “I understand the pain of the families [but] you were given two years to evacuate. Look at what this virus is doing to Israel and how dangerous it is to our democracy,” Herzog said. He then quoted the verse from the Ethics of Our Fathers. In May 2012 the-then MK Miri Regev apologized after she called Sudanese asylum-seekers in Israel “a cancer in our body” during a speech. Regev, of the Likud party, said her statement was misconstrued after she come under fire for the comment, which some people criticized as being similar to the types of accusations that were made about Jews during the Holocaust. She explained that she was talking about the phenomenon of illegal migration and not about the migrants themselves. The Regulation Bill is not yet law, but the nod of support from the Ministerial Committee for Legislation on Sunday means it is on its way toward becoming a government-sponsored bill, a status that would put significant pressure on the coalition’s majority in the Knesset to help advance it into law. Caravan homes at the Amona outpost in the West Bank, October 6, 2016. (FLASH90) The legislation, proposed by the nationalist-Orthodox Jewish Home party, is designed to avert the court-ordered demolition of the Amona outpost. It was previously deemed unconstitutional and a likely violation of international law by Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, who told the government there may not be legal grounds on which to defend it when it faces an all-but-certain appeal to the High Court of Justice. In 2014, the High Court of Justice ruled that the Amona outpost, which lies several kilometers east of Ramallah, was built on private Palestinian land and must be demolished by December 25 of this year. The decision followed over a decade of delays and appeals by the state, the Palestinians from a nearby village and the residents of Amona. The impending evacuation could threaten to destabilize Netanyahu’s strongly right-wing coalition, which relies heavily on the pro-settlement right.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Cooler Master's MasterLiquid Maker 92 CPU cooler reviewed Liquid cooling in a tower-cooler footprint by Jeff Kampman  6:48 PM on November 10, 2016 For builders looking to cool a hot-clocked CPU like Intel's Core i7-6700K, tower-style coolers and closed-loop liquid coolers come with tradeoffs. Go with the tower-style air cooler, and you might need a 170-mm tall monster with multiple 140-mm fans to keep your system cool and quiet. Choose a liquid cooler, and you have to find a place for a huge radiator stack to exhaust its waste heat or hope that your case's airflow is otherwise good enough to move that hot air out. Liquid coolers often leave CPU voltage-regulation circuitry at the mercy of fans around the CPU socket, too, and their pump noise can be an annoyance to those with sensitive ears. Those tradeoffs are hard enough to make in a roomy ATX mid-tower, but builders of high-end systems in compact microATX or Mini-ITX cases might have an especially hard time finding a powerful enough cooler to make their dreams a reality. Often, it's not even possible to fit a big enough air cooler for high-performance builds inside cases like the Corsair Carbide Series Air 240 or the Graphite Series 380T—it's liquid or nothing. Cooler Master is trying to help those small-form-factor builders out by bringing the best of air and liquid coolers together in one heatsink: the MasterLiquid Maker 92. The concept behind this $100 cooler is so unusual that it doesn't really have its own category yet, so let me explain. The Maker 92 sandwiches a self-contained pump and radiator between a pair of push-pull 95-mm fans. That cooling stack rests atop a bracket that allows the sandwich to rest in a vertical position, like a tower cooler, or in a horizontal one, like a blow-down air cooler. Where the base and heatpipes of a traditional tower-style cooler might go, Cooler Master snaked a pair of coolant hoses down to a low-profile water block with a hefty copper cold plate. This entire self-contained apparatus sits right on top of the CPU socket, just like a tower-style cooler would. It's compact, as well. In its horizontal position, the Maker 92 is just 4.7" (118.8 mm) tall, and its relatively compact footprint shouldn't cause clearance issues with tall memory heatsinks or motherboards with a PCIe x16 slot close to the CPU socket. Flip the cooling stack upright, and the Maker 92 measures in at 6.6" tall (167.5 mm), about the same as the iconic Hyper 212 Evo or the MasterAir Pro 4 we just reviewed. Cooler Master's unique design requires some tradeoffs of its own. The MasterAir Maker 92 only works with Intel LGA 115x and LGA 2011 sockets—builders with AMD CPUs are left entirely out in the cold. On the off chance you still own an Intel LGA 775 or LGA 1366 motherboard, you also won't find mounting hardware in the Maker 92's box. If you've been building from our recent System Guides, those constraints shouldn't be cause for concern, but they do mean the Maker 92's appeal may not be as wide as it could have been. Builders likely won't be able to swap out the Maker 92's fans, either—their unique 95-mm dimensions aside, these fans are designed specifically to let the Maker 92 do its swivelly thing. If I had to pick a pair of fans to be stuck with, however, the Maker 92's could share far worse lineage than Cooler Master's own Silencio 120 FPs. These fans use five broadly-swept blades in a design that's optimized for static pressure—important for moving air through densely-packed radiator fins. The MasterLiquid Maker 92 draws power from a combination SATA-and-PWM cable that can be gently split in two for more routing freedom. That's handy, since most builders probably won't want to route a dedicated chain of SATA power connectors into the main chambers of their cases just to power the Maker 92. One interesting thing about the Maker 92 is that its fans can shut off entirely when the CPU underneath is at idle. By default, the internal circuitry of the Maker 92 cuts off the fans when the PWM duty cycle from the motherboard falls below 50%. That means the only sound from the cooler at idle will be its pump—a potentially appealing characteristic in noise-sensitive environments. Folks who would prefer airflow at idle will need to set the PWM duty cycle on their CPU fan headers to a level above 50%.

The Land Rover Discovery's newest feature is just for you By David Booth 8 hours ago Small Medium Large Despite all the talk about car sharing — Turo now claims 2 million members willing to pimp out their ride — and data sharing — by 2020, the average autonomous car will be pumping 4,000 gigabytes of data into the cloud-o-sphere, says the CEO of Intel — the most significant advancement, at least the most significant immediate advancement for this timid U-hauler, at this year’s Los Angeles Auto Show’s technology exposition was Land Rover’s Advanced Tow Assist. For those of you used to reversing 18-wheelers into the tight confines of a loading bay, JLR’s assisted towing will prove little more than a nuisance, all the ingenious software and precautionary slow speeds wasted. But for those of us — and, as I have already admitted numerous times, I am absolutely terrified of backing up a trailer — it’s nothing short of a Godsend. Essentially, all that’s necessary — once you’ve keyed in basic dimensions such as the distance from the tongue to the axle and the wheelbase (if it’s a dual axle kit) for your trailer-to-be — is to engage the Tow Assist program and then set the desired destination. You still have to manage the throttle and brake, but Tow Assist does the rest, including warning the driver if the trajectory that he, or she, has chosen will result in a jack-knife situation. Determining your destination is done via the Discovery’s Terrain Response 2 rotary controller Determining the destination is done via the Terrain Response 2 rotary controller. Simply match the desired parking space and the rear of the trailer via the rearview camera’s digital trajectory lines (think of rear park assist guidelines in your current rearview camera) and then slowly backup. The technology takes over and the steering wheel flails about, first one way — to set up the turn — and then the other — to complete the desired arc. It’s all so very seamless, the only caveat that you may have to — as I did — update the destination once you get closer to the parking space. Nonetheless, reversing the big Land Rover with a 23-foot Airstream in tow was a doddle. Smaller boat trailers are now child’s play and even a huge horse trailer was an easily surmountable adventure in parking. Considering that the system is simply an amalgam of the existing centre console screen, standard parking software and cameras in the rear hatch as well as one in each side mirror, this is yet another one of those technologies that, once you’ve sampled it, leaves you wondering why it took so long to come to market. For anyone who has ever shied away from a recreational activity because the idea of trailering the equipment was too daunting, your shame is over.

BlackPearl is a SpectraLogic system; it calls it a deep storage gateway, that front-ends disk and tape archiving to target back-end repositories, accepting and retrieving data through its HTTP command facility. This is an extension of Amazon's S3 storage interface. Spectra is announcing: Lustre HPC archiving using Campaign Storage's HSM software. Ceph backup and archiving through BlackPearl. The Lustre archiving integration is formally called the SpectraLogic Lustre Archive Campaign Storage Solution (SLACSS) and has Spectra's BlackPearl gateway acting as the target storage device. It needs Campaign Storage's* HSM product, Intel's Lustre file system and an industry-standard policy manager (such as Robinhood). Spectra says it provides "nearly instantaneous archive search," management, parallel performance and "nearly unlimited scalability." Spectra CTO Matt Starr claimed in a canned quote that the integrated setup solves "the core performance issues present in current archive systems ... [By] adding control and monitoring for large parallel data moves, Spectra and its partners have created a revolutionary platform that will transform the entire storage architecture of HPC and big data solutions." The Laureate Institute for Brain Research (LIBR) has developed an integration, a Ceph client, between its Ceph clustered file system storage environment and the BlackPearl gateway, which is designed for backup and archive. As BlackPearl can shunt files off to tape – thank you LTFS – LIBR can write all of the organization's data to BlackPearl and on to its own LTO tape infrastructure. LIBR used Spectra's SDK and the Spectra HTTP command set to craft the Ceph client. It will be offering this Ceph-BlackPearl integration code to any BlackPearl user by the end of December 2016, free of charge, through GitHub. The happy Spectra BlackPearl pirates can now sail their ship into Lustre and Ceph harbors and pillage for archiving business. ® *Dr Peter Braam is the CEO of Campaign Storage LLC and the creator of the Lustre file system.

November 14, 2016 Sabina Chaudhuri, Business Systems Analyst  My journey started back in 2011 when I decided to pursue a career in managerial economics from the University of California, Davis. I spent my first two years heavily involved with student organizations and dance teams. My interest for technology started when I visited the tech company my older sister was working at. I loved the atmosphere and decided I wanted to follow in her footsteps. Starting my junior year, I juggled between running a student organization, working on campus, and completing internships at companies such as CBS and Intel. When senior year came around, I realized I wanted to pursue a career working as an analyst and came across Cisco at our Fall Career Fair. After going through the entire recruiting process I received my offer letter and was excited to start the next journey of my life. I decided to choose Cisco because I knew my position would challenge me and allow me to grow professionally and personally. At Cisco I work as a Business Systems Analyst on the Global Infrastructure: Business Strategy Team. I work with analytics to help support business decisions. The culture and the people around me is what makes me love Cisco as a company. When I listen to the career journey of my fellow peers, it motivates me to maintain a forward-thinking mindset and to always work hard. I am an avid traveler, a knowledge seeker of business, philosophy and random art, and love to spend my weekends outdoors with my family/friends and my dog. Growing up I played the piano, loved to dance, and played varsity golf for my high school. Since I was born in the Bay Area, I bleed blue and gold (Go Warriors!) and have a tradition of going to a Warriors game with my dad every winter. If you see me around the San Jose site, feel free to stop and ask me about what book I am reading or my favorite place to travel!

Carnegie Mellon's Student Newspaper Since 1906 November 14, 2016 Current Issue Home News Sci/Tech Forum Sports Pillbox Comics Advertising Archives November 14, 2016 Join the Staff | Advertising | About Us | Contact Us Bluetooth technology connects devices together wirelessly Stephanie You Nov 13, 2016 Tweet EMAIL PRINT Suggest this article to a friend: From: (name) (email) To: (email) In today’s media-run world, Bluetooth technology surrounds us in our cars, in our pockets, and on our ears. With its beginnings rooted in the ‘90s, back when people used Nokia 9000s, Bluetooth has revolutionized the way devices communicate wirelessly. With Bluetooth, we can wirelessly play music on speakers from our phones, transfer photos between devices, and so much more. The Bluetooth Special Interest Group originally consisted of five companies: Ericsson, IBM, Intel, Toshiba, and Nokia. Now, it has over 20,000 member companies, and its growth does not show signs of stagnating. Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard used to exchange data across devices in close proximity. To communicate, industrial, scientific, and medical devices (ISM) send short-wavelength radio waves across 79 designated Bluetooth channels on the globally unlicensed ISM radio frequency band. It is inexpensive, automatic, and low-energy. Even with Bluetooth running in the background of a smartphone, the battery is hardly drained. The most recent Bluetooth standard, version 4.2, has a theoretical maximum speed of 25 megabits per second (Mbps) and a theoretical maximum range of 100 meters, or 330 feet. The upcoming version, 5.0, will have a theoretical maximum speed of 50 Mbps and a theoretical maximum range of 800 meters, over 2600 feet. Bluetooth allows for eight devices to be connected at once, and the devices can automatically detect each other. Each Bluetooth device has a small computer chip with a Bluetooth radio and software. Communication between devices occurs over networks called piconets, or personal-area networks (PAN) — individual networks of devices connected using Bluetooth protocols. One of the devices becomes the “master,” and all other connected devices act as “slaves.” A master and a slave could switch positions, too; the positions are not rigid. Moreover, while the master can have multiple slaves, as of right now, slaves cannot have more than one master. This type of network is called an ad-hoc computer network — it is spontaneous, decentralized, and does not rely on a pre-existing infrastructure of hardware. Bluetooth uses a radio technology called frequency-hopping spread spectrum in which transmitted data is divided into packets, and each packet is transmitted on one of the 79 channels. There are “even slots” and “odd slots” of time in which a packet can be transmitted. For single-slot situations, the master transmits data in even slots and receives in odd slots, while the slave receives in even slots and transmits in odd slots. So, if there is more than one slave, how does the master transmit packets to all? Using an algorithm called round-robin scheduling, the master handles each slave without priority in a circular order, and switches rapidly between devices; transmitters change frequencies 1600 times per second. The specs of Bluetooth technology eliminate the problems of infrared wireless technology, which television remotes use. First, Bluetooth does not need the devices to be in each others’ lines of sight, contrasting with how we need to point television remotes at the television for them to work. The devices only need to be visible in a quasi-optical wireless path, referring to an invisible network in which two things are in the same region. Second, Bluetooth works across multiple devices at the same time, as mentioned before. While the impacts Bluetooth has had on our society are far from simple, Bluetooth protocols operate with the ideals of simplicity and low cost.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums MSI Trident wants to be part of a portable VR rig by Wayne Manion  1:00 PM on November 15, 2016 The Rift and Vive VR headsets offers substantially better audiovisual fidelity compared to mobile-based VR experiences. Unfortunately, the packaging and setup for PC-based VR rigs is less convenient, particularly for those that wish to transport their VR systems for demonstrations. MSI seeks to stick a fork in those pains with the Trident, which the manufacturer calls the "smallest VR-Ready gaming PC." The Trident comes with a choice of Skylake Intel Core i5-6400 or i7-6700 CPUs and custom-designed Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 graphics card in 3GB and 6GB variants. All this goes into a chassis that takes up a volume of only 4.7L. MSI's "Silent Storm" cooling system with independent chambers for the CPU and graphics card aims to keep system temperatures in check. The Trident's pair of SODIMM slots can accomodate up to 32GB of memory, though memory clock speeds are limited 2133 MT/s. Storage devices can go into a 2.5" drive bay and an M.2 slot. Wireless connectivity comes by way of an Intel 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 adapter. The Trident's front panel has audio jacks, one USB 3.1 Type-C and two USB 3.1 Type-A ports, and an HDMI connector that MSI labels VR Link. Additional connections on the rear panel include a Gigabit Ethernet port, a USB 3.1 Type-A connector, four USB 2.0 ports, and additional display connections. The Trident's external dimensions ring in at 13.6" x 9.1" x 2.8" (34.6 cm x 23.2 cm x 7.2 cm) without a stand. The Trident comes with its own 230-W power brick. The PC can lay down, or it can be mounted vertically in the included stand. Either way, the Trident's RGB LED lighting should help the Trident blend into or stand out from its environment. MSI did not provide pricing information, but the company did say it expects the Trident to ship in mid-November.

No, I’m not talking about the impact of a Trump presidency, but something bigger—much bigger. The impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related technologies, including machine learning, deep learning and neural networks, is now starting to be felt almost everywhere we look. (See my previous column “Learning About Deep Learning” for more.) From everyday devices like PCs and smartphones, to media companies like Facebook, to smart home security services, to connected cars and even to medical diagnostics, the influence of AI is growing rapidly. Not only is it changing the products and services we use, it’s dramatically reshaping the technical infrastructure behind cloud-based services ranging from web searching to communications bots to personalized advertising (unfortunately!) and much more. Driving improvements in AI performance is also becoming a key motivating factor for product developments and strategic partnerships. In fact, it seems like virtually all the biggest news-related announcements from tech vendors now have some kind of AI-related angle. On the semiconductor side, for example, nVidia, AMD, Intel, Qualcomm and many others are focused on creating chips and software that can drive massive improvements in deep learning in large data centers. At this week’s SC16 supercomputing conference, for example, nVidia talked about its efforts on the Cancer Moonshot, a project it’s working on with the National Cancer Institute and the US Department of Energy to deliver a decade of advances in cancer research in just five years thanks to GPU-driven AI applications. AMD unveiled a new partnership with Google for using its latest GPUs in Google’s Compute Engine and Cloud Machine Learning services, as well as enhancements to its open-source AI-focused Radeon Open Compute Platform (ROCm). In the world of media, Facebook just announced that it’s planning to leverage AI to help combat its problem with fake news stories. In the devices world, Apple has talked about its AI efforts to help make Siri smarter about your needs and interests, while still maintaining privacy. Google, meanwhile, is leveraging AI to build up a whole range of services that are both more contextually aware of the environments you might find yourself in, as well as personally aware of the specific ways you like to use them. The question is, are we ready for the onslaught of AI? It’s clear that tech-related companies certainly are. But for individuals, the answers are a bit more opaque. In short, we’re being surrounded by the first significant fruits from the long-growing but previously near-barren AI tree. For many, these fruits may not offer much taste yet, but it’s clear from early nibbles, that we’re due for an explosion of flavor. The question then is, are we ready for the onslaught of AI? Based on numerous signs, it’s clear that tech-related companies certainly are. But for individuals, the answers are a bit more opaque. Sure, it’s easy to get excited about the possibilities that AI and related technologies offer, but there can be downsides as well, particularly regarding privacy. The real trick behind many AI-based products and services is to recognize patterns and then react to those patterns based on previous knowledge about an individual’s preferences. In a positive case, a digital assistant might be able to use that knowledge to help you make better decisions. As many have started to recognize, however, technologies with good intentions can often be used in unexpected and negative ways. The same set of data about your habits and preferences could be leveraged by criminals to figure out how and when to digitally burglarize you, for example. Unfortunately, understanding not just the intentions but the decidedly human biases that creep into (or even form the foundation of) the algorithms that drive AI-based products can be very challenging. Nevertheless, as the AI era dawns around us, it’s best to be prepared for a wide range of potential outcomes, with the knowledge that there are bound to be few unpleasant bumps along the way.

It’s about making innovative products that drive narratives about the future of computing. The company late last month held its Windows 10 Update event. Making software presentations interesting is a chore. So Microsoft decided to go to a place far away from its utilitarian roots. It showed off hardware so cool you could imagine seeing the gear in an episode of the tech-trendy, sci-fi TV series Black Mirror. We’re talking sleek, futuristic and aimed at the hip, creative people Apple  (AAPL) normally attracts. Microsoft’s Surface Studio PC (shown below) is a gorgeous 28-inch all-in-one computer with a single hidden cord. The most striking feature of the device is the massive high-resolution touch-screen monitor. Microsoft says the 4500 x 3000 screen will easily push its 13.5 million pixels thanks to a best-in-class Nvidia (NVDA) graphics unit, backed by Intel (INTC) core i5 or i7 chipsets and 32-gigs of RAM. But the real shocker is the slim 13-millimeter aluminum case and the adjustable arm that allows the unit to lie nearly flat for drawing. The Microsoft Surface Studio PC boasts features that rival the top-of-the-line Macs and that have Apple fans drooling. And because Microsoft is primarily a software company, it saved one new trick to leave tech observers slack-jawed: Surface Dial, a small, metal, puck-like device can be placed on the screen to manipulate the software in new ways. You can rotate the screen, select pen tips and colors for the stylus and much more. When the machine lies flat, it’s virtually like working on a drawing board. This appeal to creative professionals might seem out of character for Microsoft. Its Microsoft Office productivity suite remains the first choice for corporations to create and manage documents. That strength has carried into the cloud. Despite a multiple-year head start for Google Docs, Office 365 has enjoyed rapid adoption. The suite added 900,000 subscribers in the most recent quarter reported October 20. The Office lock-in is also helping Microsoft continue to build out its hybrid and public cloud businesses, which are led by Azure. And while Azure still runs a distant second to Amazon Web Services overall, sales and profit margins are soaring despite continued massive investment in infrastructure. In the first quarter, Azure had a profit margin of 49% on sales of $6.32 billion. And it is worth noting that Azure is becoming a major player in fast-growing business concentrations like Blockchain and the Internet of Things. In a research note, Morningstar analyst Rodney Nelson wrote: “We view Microsoft’s public cloud offering Azure as a multifaceted service that not only provides substantial growth opportunities, but also serves as a natural hedge against potential declines in other aspects of its business.” Microsoft has a reputation for building utilitarian software products your boss makes you use to get work done. The Surface Studio is certainly not that. It’s something traditional Apple customers will want to buy. That’s a good narrative for a company best known for spreadsheets. Microsoft shares were down as much as 10% for the year in mid-summer but are now up 9%. They are just emerging from a 16-year trough, so they are rested and ready for their next leg higher.

Blog 3D XPoint  Reality, Opportunity, and Competition Sang-Yun Lee, CEO, BeSang Inc. 11/15/2016 11:16 AM EST  9 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet 3D XPoint was debuted with big claims in 2015. However, there are many wild guess and speculations because details have not been shared in public domain Early this year, details about 3D XPoint came out from EE Times interview with Guy Blalock, co-CEO of IM Flash. 3D XPoint is well-known phase change memory and switch (PCMS). (Picture source: Intel) According to Micron, 3D XPoint has many technical and operational challenges, such as 100 new materials raising supply chain issues, cutting fab throughput by 15%, 3x-5x increase in capital expenses compared to planar NAND, and heavily depending on lithography tools. Therefore, 3D XPoint becomes expensive. The 2nd generation 3D XPoint with 4-layer stacking is expected to be about 5 times more expensive than planar NAND. So, it seems difficult to be an affordable storage device. Instead, 3D NAND will serve the storage market. According to Intel/Micron, 3D XPoint is aiming at high-end SSD and DDR4 NVDIMM markets. Though, 3D XPoint-based SSD will serve niche market because of cost issue. The sweet spot of 3D XPoint should be the DDR4 NVDIMM because of low read latency (i.e. ~100ns). The configuration of DDR4 NVDIMM is shown below. Data comes to DRAM from CPU and copied to 3D XPoint. Then, the data goes back to CPU from 3D XPoint. It is possible because 3D XPoint has low read latency. However, because 3D XPoint has much less endurance compared to DRAM and its write speed is very slow, it cannot directly replace DRAM. Instead, as a shadow of DRAM, data in DRAM is copied to 3D XPoint in order to expand the size of main memory. In this case, DRAM works as a buffer for 3D XPoint. As a result, 3D XPoint will significantly replace DRAM if it works well. One important consideration is the cost of 3D XPoint. The 2nd generation of 3D XPoint with 4-layer stack is expected to be about half price of DRAM. If the cost advantage of 3D XPoint over DRAM is less than 2x, then, customers may prefer to use DRAM instead of 3D XPoint even though 3D XPoint is non-volatile. DRAM still continues about 30% bit growth every year. So, considering the technical and operational difficulties associated with mass production of 3D XPoint, it will not be easy for 3D XPoint to keep up with 2x cost advantage over DRAM. (Picture source: BeSang Inc.) Software-based NVDIMM-P is emerging as a competitor against 3D XPoint. As shown below, predictive software allocates data between NAND and DRAM in anticipation of being needed. In fact, such prediction may work or may not work well. In order to increase the chance of success, NVDIMM-P should increase the size of DRAM. Therefore, NVDIMM-P strongly depends on DRAM while 3D XPoint reduces the dependence on DRAM. (Picture source: The Register) 3D Super-NOR is also emerging and could replace 3D XPoint. Similar to 3D XPoint, 3D Super-NOR is NOR-based non-volatile memory having low ready latency (i.e. ~100ns). It does not need huge fab investment. Memory cell is vertically stackable and it has very small cell size (i.e. 4F2). Unlike 3D XPoint, no new material and no extreme process are needed at all. Most importantly, 3D Super-NOR is about 10 times cheaper than 3D XPoint and 20 time cheaper than DRAM. Therefore, 3D Super-NOR will be attractive as a replacement of DRAM at DDR4 NVDIMM. As shown below, 3D Super-NOR shares the same memory cell structure with 3D Super-NAND which is expected to be 2 cents per GB. (Picture source: BeSang Inc.) 3D XPoint has huge market potential as a main memory. However, the technical and operational difficulties associated with mass production of 3D XPoint may make it difficult to be an affordable solution over DRAM. Software-based NVDIMM-P could be a low cost alternative solution. However, there should be limitation as a software driven technology. It also increases DRAM dependence. 3D Super-NOR could replace 3D XPoint and provide the most affordable storage class memory solution. Sang-Yun Lee is the CEO of BeSang Inc.

Magnetic bubbles went the same way. Flash is like 15x cheaper than DRAM, so 2x cheaper with fast read speeds is likely only attractive for really large mostly read data. Not sure how big the market is for that.

Specs 25 Pictures Best Deals Pros Powerful CPU and GPU Processor and graphics overclocking Great design Punchy speakers Cons High temperatures and noise output Middling keyboard So-so screen quality Key Features 3.6GHz Intel Core i7-6820HK 8GB Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 17.3-inch 2,560 x 1,440 G-Sync IPS screen 16GB 2,400MHz DDR4 memory 256GB Toshiba XG3 M.2 SSD 1TB hard disk Windows 10 64-bit 1-year RTB warranty Manufacturer: Gigabyte Review Price: £2,500.00 What is Aorus X7 v6? It’s normal for notebooks to make compromises, but Aorus machines try to go above and beyond. Take the X7 v6, which includes a huge list of features: a GTX 1070 GPU, an overclockable Core i7 processor and a 120Hz screen with G-Sync. The result is a gaming monster. Related: Best PC Games Aorus X7 v6 – Features The GTX 1070 is proving to be the most popular Nvidia Pascal GPU chipset. It’s powerful enough to play any game at Full HD and 1440p, and it’s not as expensive as the GTX 1080, which is really designed for 4K. The mobile version of the GTX 1070 has 2,048 stream processors and a 1,442MHz core alongside 8GB of memory, which puts it on par with the desktop card. Here, though, Aorus has done something unusual – it's overclocked the GPU. The GTX 1070 runs at five pre-configured speeds. The first option is selected by default, which means the GPU runs at 1,468MHz and with 8,060MHz memory. The fifth option sets those clocks to 1,543MHz and 8,208MHz. Impressively, the GPU isn’t the only overclockable component – the Core i7-6820HK is the only Intel mobile CPU with an unlocked multiplier. By default the Aorus runs at 4GHz, which is the machine’s beefiest CPU overclock, but it can be toned down to 3.6GHz – still miles above the CPU’s 2.7GHz stock pace. This overclocking helps the Aorus to stand out. The Gigabyte P35X v6 is a superb GTX 1070 laptop, but it ran at stock speeds and costs less at £2,100. The £2,550 Scan 3XS LG17 Carbon Extreme is a 17.3-inch system with a GTX 1080 and a desktop-class Core i7-6700K processor, but no overclocking. The rest of the specification is good, but contains no surprises. There’s 16GB of 2,400MHz DDR4 memory, a 512GB Toshiba XG3 SSD and a 1TB hard disk. Qualcomm's Killer gaming brand provides the Ethernet and wireless connectivity, and there’s also Bluetooth. Two alternative specifications are available: the X7 v6-CF2 costs £2,200 and has a 1080p screen and 256GB SSD, while the £3,000 X7 DT v6-CF1 has 32GB of memory and a GTX 1080. Aorus X7 v6 – Design Aorus laptops always look great. The mirrored logo on the lid lights up and the power button is illuminated. The button is flanked with dramatic grilles for the system’s fans, and the trackpad has another Aorus logo. There’s a chunky rear section with vents alongside smaller exhausts on the machine’s left- and right-hand edges. Those edges hold USB 3 and USB 3.1 connectors, HDMI and Mini DisplayPort outputs, and an SD card slot. Related: Best Gaming Mice The Aorus is slimmer and lighter than its main rival, too. It weighs 3.2kg and is 25mm thick, which is impressive for a machine with this specification – the Scan is a kilo heavier and half a centimetre thicker. Despite the relative slimness, the Aorus is sturdy throughout. The base panel can be removed, but it’s held down by a dozen Torx screws, which is awkward. However, it reveals two memory sockets and a spare M.2 connector free, which is good for a notebook.

Google, Intel and IBM are just some of the big names investing millions currently in the field of quantum computing which will enable faster, more efficient computing required to power our future computing needs. Now a researcher and his team at Tyndall National Institute in Cork have made a ‘quantum leap’ by developing a technical step that could enable the use of quantum computers sooner than expected. Conventional digital computing uses ‘on-off’ switches, but quantum computing looks to harness quantum state of matters – such as entangled photons of light or multiple states of atoms – to encode information. In theory, this can lead to much faster and more powerful computer processing, but the technology to underpin quantum computing is currently difficult to develop at scale.

Or a zero client running a virtual desktop? Packet.net strong-ARMs cloud for $0.005 per core per hour Packet.net, a bare-metal cloud aimed at developers, has flicked the switch on cloud-running servers powered by a pair of Cavium's 48-core ARMv8-A ThunderX processors. CEO Zachary Smith told The Register that the company's cooked up the cloud for a few reasons. Price is one: Packet will offer ARM cores at a tenth of the price it charges for Intel cores, at US$0.50 per hour per server, or $0.005 per core per hour. Smith thinks that will be a head-turner by itself. He also thinks developers will appreciate the chance to try native Docker on many-cored machines and appreciate the opportunity an ARM-powered cloud represents as they pursue 100 per cent portable software. He believes open source folk will see the arrival of an ARM-powered cloud as incentive to accelerate cross-platform versions of their pet projects. Even ARM will benefit, he says, because having a working cloud on the market will give both it and licensees more reason to innovate for the data centre. ARM's recent purchaser, SoftBank, recently tipped some money into Packet.net, but Smith swears he's had a long-term ambition to offer an ARM-powered cloud, if only because he enjoys having multiple ARM server CPU vendors willing to do deals. That kind of competition is not currently possible in the x86 world, at least until AMD returns to servers in 2017. Smith also feels that ARM clouds are inevitable, probably thanks to telcos looking to offer cores to rent at the edge of their networks. The CEO feels that telcos will build edge clouds because they're sick of over-the-top players having all the fun and profits: this time telcos want to build a revenue-generating platform beyond mere carriage. For now, Packet's ARM cloud offers 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04, but promises that CoreOS, FreeBSD and CentOS are in the pipeline. Four different ARM server configurations are also in the works. The cloud will have an API, a portal, and will also be accessible from DevOps favourites likes Terraform and Ansible. Four of the company's bit barns – in Parsippany New Jersey, Sunnyvale California, Amsterdam and Tokyo – will offer the service as of Tuesday. "We want to offer a super-cheap, 'you would be stupid not to try it' offering," Smith told The Register. "If we can get the open source ecosystem rebooted, I think Intel's grip on the data centre will be shattered." ® Sponsored: 10 Reasons LinuxONE is the best choice for Linux workloads Tips and corrections 3 Comments More from The Register Broadcom would certainly be broader with Brocade on board Fibre Channel market entering the merchant silicon end-game phase Broadcom snaps up Brocade for $5.9bn We want your Fibre Channel SAN stuff, but the IP biz can take a hike 6 Comments Cavium and QLogic sitting in a tree, S I G N I N G Chip designer plonks US$1.3 billion on table for data centre push Emulex joins Brocade, ATTO and QLogic in 32Gbit/s FC sprintfest Fibre Channel accelerates to flash array speeds QLogic boosted profits 700% in a year.

The report titled “Pedal to the Metal: Mitigating New Threats Faster with Rapid Intel and Automation” is underwritten by Palo Alto Networks and is based on an online survey of 150 federal employees that work with security operations teams, MeriTalk said Monday. “To address today’s threats and prevent successful cyberattacks, it’s imperative to automate the creation and distribution of new protections in near-real time and predict the attacker’s next step,” said Pamela Warren, director of government and industry initiatives at Palo Alto Networks. “The survey indicates feds have plenty of data, but need to implement the tools and the processes to achieve that goal,” Warren added. MeriTalk added 20 percent of respondents said that 12 or more members of their agency’s security operations center team create custom signatures for security technologies; correlate isolated network events and indicators of compromise; and form actionable threat intelligence from various feeds. Thirty percent of federal security operations employees are inclined to invest in technologies that will automate signature creation and distribution, the report found. The survey also revealed 71 percent of agencies use automated analysis and reports to address data volume and focus on tracking targeted attacks while 48 percent use dynamic analysis, 32 percent apply static analysis and 19 percent practice machine learning techniques. Security operations employees subscribe to an average of 25 external feeds daily and 72 percent of respondents state it takes hours to days to identify unique threats while 81 percent say it takes the same amount of time to form security changes. MeriTalk noted 15 percent of respondents claim their agencies can establish security measures against new threats within minutes while 17 percent can distribute protections for enforcement during the same time frame. Sixty-one percent of agencies have the capacity to automatically disseminate information on malicious behaviors across different enforcement points. Most agencies monitor traditional entry points like mail servers  and internet gateways but less than half protect data centers, Software-as-a-service enforcement points and mobile endpoints, according to the report.

If you go to the MSI Global news section there's an article, pictures and specifications for this machine uploaded. However the dedicated launch site still has 8 hours on the clock… So, its good to have the cold hard facts about this machine in the form of a spec list. Basically this compact VR gaming PC is based upon your choice between an Intel Skylake Core i7-6700 and i5-6400 with the graphics grunt supplied by either a 3GB or 6GB GeForce GTX 1060. Supporting those twin processing power plants you can install up to 32GB of DDR4 2133MHz RAM (via 2x SODIMM slots) and both an M.2 and a 2.5-inch SATA storage device. The headline of this story calls out the compact size MSI has managed to shoehorn the components into. The unit measures 346 x 232 x 72mm without the (upright) stand with an internal capacity of 4.7 litres. MSI includes a stand so you can position the Trident horizontally or vertically to suit. We don't know the weight of the Trident. A couple of days ago MSI released a teaser pic highlighting the Silent Storm 2 cooling system (reproduced above). According to today's news, the chassis is compartmentalised, with "key components in different chambers with optimized airflow". It is apparently fine tuned to allow super-silent gaming for hours on end. As you can see from the pictures, MSI has positioned handy VR Ready ports to the front of the chassis. Last but not least the Trident features RGB Mystic Light with many colours and effects available. MSI hasn't given any pointers regarding pricing but says that this complete ready-to-go VR system will be available worldwide from mid-November (very soon).

Register today! Posted by EndlessWaves - Tue 15 Nov 2016 12:36 “with an internal capacity of 4.7 litres” Great, now I know how much water it'll hold if I ever need to use it as a bucket. Such a silly statement can only have come from a marketing department and I'm surprised you reprinted it. The volume the case takes up is ~5.8 litres. Plus whatever size the hefty 230W external PSU is, probably another half a litre. Overall it looks like a reasonable approach, it's a shame about the external PSU and lack of Freesync option (not to mention the looks) but it could turn out to be decently quiet. Posted by plexabit - Tue 15 Nov 2016 14:12 I think MSI conveniently forgot the Zotac EN1060, EN1070, and EN1080. But those don't have upgradeable CPU/GPU. Hopefully there are cards released that will work in this.

Or a zero client running a virtual desktop? Packet.net strong-ARMs cloud for $0.005 per core per hour Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) has clarified its requirements for a new supercomputer, after an inquiry from The Register pointed out an inconsistency in its tender. As we reported yesterday, CSIRO's tender called for Windows compatibility and either Intel x86 or IBM Power CPUs. As the latter won't run Windows, we concluded that perhaps CSIRO mentioned Power as a nod to competition rather than out of sincere interest in Big Blue's silicon but asked CSIRO to explain the seeming anomaly. CSIRO's procurement officer has responded to let us know that “Addendum No. 1 has been published on the AusTender site to answer your query” and to “Thank you for your advice that clarification may be required.” The thanks come because the Addendum explains that “If an IBM Power system is offered then Windows compatibility is not required.” IBM's therefore back in play with both its silicon and its services to port x86 code to Power systems running Linux.

Comments CIO | Nov 14, 2016 8:07 AM PT Like this article? thumbsup +1 thumbsdown RELATED TOPICS MacBooks MacOS Hardware Laptops Comments Apple has finally announced the much-awaited upgrades to its Pro line of MacBooks. As expected, Apple made some unorthodox decisions and they are getting beaten up for it. I use a mix of technologies. I have a MacBook, Chromebook, Google Pixel C, Windows 10 PC and I primarily use openSUSE on my main desktop. As a result, I consider myself well educated on the advantages and disadvantages of each platform, without any bias. Although my 2013 MacBook with 8GB of RAM is in great shape and is my go-to device when I am not on my desktop, I am looking at upgrading it to the new MacBook. Should I? In this post I am addressing some of the unfair criticism of the new MacBook Pro and also talking about the facts that make them great devices. First things first: Hardware specs The new MacBooks are running on Intel’s 6th generation Sky Lake processors and not the newly released Kaby Lake. Does that matter? It would have been better if Apple used the latest chips, but for a MacBook user Kaby Lake doesn’t really make a big difference. Both processors are 14nm and are literally identical. The only slight difference you may notice is in the battery life if you watch 4K video. Period. Don’t forget, MacBooks have a long shelf life (Apple claims four years, but they go beyond four years depending on your usecase). Since Intel is moving away from tick-tock model they will probably be releasing a new processor every year. No matter which processor Apple pack into their MacBooks, it’s going to be old by the following year. So don’t keep falling for the newer hardware madness telling you that you should always have the latest and greatest hardware. Is 16GB RAM enough? The short answer is yes. I have the 2013 MacBook Pro that came with 8GB of RAM. Initially I fretted  whether this device is future proof or not. We are approaching 2017 and I am heavily using Adobe Premier, Photoshop, Lightroom and 3d modeling software, and MacBook is serving me very well. In fact it outperformed a high end 2016 laptop with 16GB of RAM. Yes, it would be great to have a 32GB model, but I won’t go over 16GB of RAM for an ultrabook. Why? Because RAM is not a magic potion, you need an equally powerful processor to process the data. USB Type C Thank you Apple for removing all legacy USB ports from the device. USB has been nothing more than a mess. There are at least 7 legacy USB ports. I have to carry around at least 5 types of USB cables  to be able to connect to my devices. My Western Digital external hard drive uses USB B, whereas Nikon d750 uses UC-E17 USB Cable, headphone charger uses Micro USB and Xoom Dictaphone Mini USB, plus USB Type C for my Nexus phone. Yes. That’s legacy USB mess. And don’t forget all those HDMI cables. Please kill the legacy USB!. Get rid of all that mess and everyone, please move to USB Type C. One type to rule them all: from audio video output to charging to data transfers.Needless to say, I am very happy there are no legacy USB ports in MacBooks. Initially I will have to carry 2 adapters, but as soon as the rest of the world moves to USB Type C the better. I am already carrying 5 different cables to survive the legacy USB world. Lack of SD card reader The new MacBooks don’t have a SD card reader. How many people actually use the SD Card reader? The only use case that I can think of is photographers who may prefer SD Card. But it’s not a deal breaker for a professional photographer. Have you seen the bag of a photographer? All you will see is cables, connectors, filters, lenses, SD Cards…one more USB Type C SD Card reader is not going to break their back and chances are they already own one. Missing Magsafe Come on folks. MacBooks are the only devices that offered Magsafe. Do you have MagSafe in your Dell, HP, Lenovo, ASUS laptops? Are you tripping and falling all the time? What do you do with your iPad, iPhone, Android phones? Yes, MagSafe was a good approach but that’s not the end of the world and I am much happier to use the same USB Type C port for charging than MagSafe. Touch bar is a gimmick Finally someone is doing something for those useless function keys. If you are a Chromebook user, you already know how ‘valuable’ those are. All I care about is ‘Esc’ key as I use it heavily in the text editor, and that’s going to stay with the ‘Touch Bar’. Touch Bar is going to expand the functionality of the keyboard and applications and give me more control over features. In fact it creates new ways to interact with apps, without having to lift your fingers from the keyboard area. I love the new Touch Bar. The hidden secrets of MacBook Pro Trackpad Let me say this straight out: Apple is the only company that got the touch pad right. I have yet to come across a non-Apple laptop where trackpad is nothing more than an extension of the mouse. With the new MacBook, the trackpad is doubled in size. In addition, there is a secret that most people don’t know: with the new force field touch pads, you can convert it into a tablet by using a stylus. Apps like Inklet allow you to enjoy pressure sensitivity so all those aspiring graphic artists don’t need to buy expensive tablets. I can’t tell you how excited I am about it. They don't have touchscreen As a Chromebook Flip and Dell XPS 13 user, I can tell you touchscreens on laptops are pure waste. No one uses them. Touch screens do make sense for those devices that lack keyboard and mouse, but not on laptops. Also these touchscreens work more or less like input devices, like a mouse, so unlike iPad or Surface Pro like devices, you really can’t use them for drawing due to lack of palm rejection, it’s counterproductive. So, no, I don’t need touchscreen on my laptop. MacBooks are expensive I often hear people say Apple products are overpriced. May I ask what wasthe price of Chromebook Pixel? You get 32GB of storage for $1600. Check out laptops from Dell, HP, Lenovo … look at any vendor out there  matching the MacBook specs and you are talking about over $2000. You still get the crappy touchpad and Windows 10 that doesn’t scale apps very well for HiDPI monitors….and I won’t get into the 45 minute long downtime every time there is a system update. Yes, you can get a laptop under $300 but don’t complain about creaky hinges, unresponsive touchpad, 3Kg of weight and 4GB of RAM. The bottom line is good hardware is expensive. Just check the price of Pixel XL phone. It’s the same price of MacBook Air. Resistance to change Apple is finally pushing  laptops into new territories. Unlike Ubuntu Linux or Gnome, it’s not creating new interfaces that require users to relearn everything. It’s sticking to the WIMP paradigm and yet making game-changing improvements to hardware. That’s what we need. In all these years, the only innovation that we saw in the non-Apple market was more RAM and new CPUs. Period. Apple is pushing the envelope. I think the latest MacBook Pro is the rightful successor and I will be buying one. If you have any doubts, don’t listen to critics and get one. You won’t regret it. Trust me.

Pointing to developer’s official website, a pair of screenshots appear to confirm that Mark Lamia has now been elected Chairman of Treyarch, with Mark Gordon, Jason Blundell and Dan Bunting each assuming the title of co-Studio Head. Lamia had previously held the role of Studio Head prior to these findings, while the others filled VP of Development (Gordon), Director and Executive Producer of Campaign & Zombies (Blundell) and Game Director, Multiplayer (Bunting). At press time, there’s no mention of a statement from Treyarch to confirm or deny the purported shake-up. A separate report from Charlie Intel goes on to claim that Call of Duty: Stronghold is the current codename of 2017’s installment – Sledgehammer’s, perhaps? Citing a listing published by SAG-AFTRA, the post writes that the yet-to-be-revealed title is “also known as Call of Duty: Stronghold & Lethal Combat.” What do our readers make of this purported change at the helm?

One of the options was a discreet graphics card which once delivered is a switchable card with the built in Intel HD 530 doing most of the work. The AMD seems to take over as needed. There is limited info on the r7 A370 on the AMD website, I am assuming it is very similar to the M370 which is the laptop card. My question is is there an upgrade path for me to get a better card (r9?), I just do not know enough about the laptop/AIO environment.

TRENDING NOW: Watch Dogs 2 first impressions Home News CPU, APU & Chipsets AMD Zen - 16 CPU threads of Intel beating perf at $300?! AMD's next-gen Zen could arrive with 16 CPU threads for $300, and that would be awesome By: Anthony Garreffa | CPU, APU & Chipsets News | Posted: 1 day, 6 hours ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Alright... most of you will know that I'm beyond pumped for AMD and their next-gen Zen architecture, but there are some new details that have surfaced on the /r/AMD subreddit, and it has me even more excited.     Intel has been dominating the CPU world for what feels like forever, but when AMD does throw down - Thunderbird, Duron, Athlon X2 - it does it in a big way. Zen is the biggest stomping yet, with multiple things to be excited about. It looks like we can expect an 8-core/16-thread Zen CPU at around $300, which would be freakin' amazing.   Some of the bigger notes from the post is that Zen will arrive in a purported 6850K with 8 CPU cores/16 CPU threads for around $300. This is amazing if it's true, and I believe we are looking at this price bracket for Zen's higher-end SKUs. But then the tease that AMD's Hyper-Threading equivalent is something called SMU and that it's "******* good" with the "same efficiency as Intel's HT", should have everyone excited.   Even in gaming, the post says that Zen is "neck and neck" with Intel, "even at low res where CPU bound". As for clock speeds, as of August they were hitting 3.8GHz, but "right now" AMD is reaching 4.2GHz overclocked, and 5GHz+ using LN2. The samples will continue to improve until retail spec sampling begins to partners.   Zen details:   There are some errata issues present in the current testing samples, similar in a way to the TLB bug of the Phenom. The workaround right now is done via the BIOS. The workaround however, strips around 30 ~ 40% of the CPU performance.   The CPUs are well behind schedule and every day there's real progress and bug fixing being done. Unlike with INTEL's E0 CPUs which make it to the wild that are almost completely final silicon. AMD's samples will continue to get bug fixes right up until retail spec sampling to partners.   In August Clock speeds were 3.8GHz, right now 4.2GHz overclocking is possible, with LN2 5GHz is doable. Again this will change of course, but it is just the current silicon that is behaving like this.   AM4/ZEN uses an SOC design, that means even CMOS/BIOS configuration is on package (not necessarily on silicon, I can't confirm this) so it is possible to clear the "BIOS" and still have old value applied 30 minutes later. How this will be addressed remains to be seen. Perhaps it won't be the same scenario for final silicon   Operating voltages (nominal) are 1.3v and all the way up to 1.5v should be fine it seems for AIO cooling. Frequency scaling isn't a strong point but again that may have everything to do with the process at this point rather than an inherent design limitation.   Performance is particularly strong at this point vs. INTEL's latest offerings. Single thread performance is matching Haswell-E and of course multi-threading performance as well. Tests that are memory bandwidth dependent may go to the INTEL platform simply as a result of having more memory channels, but I can't confirm that right now and have no info on that. The important thing here is that the 16Thread/8-Core CPU is minimum 5960X performance if not better actually. (Based on Cinebench R15) with the error fix disabled.   Can't speak to how well the IMC is working as current samples are locked to low DRAM frequencies (2133MHz and lower) and of course this has an impact on performance.   As stated in the beginning, every week is progress and AMD is working at an unprecedented rate to get these ready by March.   You're unlikely to see any high-end boards for the CPUs prior to launch or at launch, simply because no vendors can commit to too much right now as plenty is changing at a rapid rate.   All overclocking is done via Overdrive, you can't change any performance features at all in the BIOS (on to that next) at all.   BIOS or UEFI is actually built into the CPU, so only AMD can update the "BIOS" or microcode. All overclocking must take place within the Operating system   Right now it takes up to 30 minutes to clear the BIOS. If you remove the CPU and place it on another motherboard, it'll have the same settings applied as on the previous board. So debugging is a nightmare   6850K SKU (May not be final designation) is wait for it.... $300 roughly. That's 8 Cores and 16 Threads   AMD's Hyper Threading is called SMU and it is ************ good. The same efficiency as Intel's HT.   Performance is really good, be it SuperPi, Cinebench, 3DMark etc, it's FPU performance is incredibly good and easily matching that of what Intel offers.   Current performance is staggering even though it is limited to 2133MHz (as mentioned before) and NorthBridge Frequency is limited to 2400MHz   There will be a nigher SKU than the 6850K, but it is a higher bin so it will certainly overclock better than 6850K and that may carry a premium price, but unlikely to be double.   There's plenty of excitement from all board vendors about the platform, so we will see how it all pans out. (Especially with the hot mess that INTEL has in store for us H2 2017, that we can leave to another thread)   For Gaming, the CPU is neck and neck with INTEL, even at low res where CPU bound.

The Dell-EMC merger has led to the formation of Dell Technologies. Mumbai: Dell Technologies chairman and chief executive officer Michael Dell is determined to change the common perception of his company—that it’s a traditional maker of low-margin products like personal computers, servers and storage systems. The view changed little even after Dell said in October 2015 that it will buy EMC Corp. Now that the merger of the two companies is complete, Dell’s strategy to alter this view is revolving around quickly rolling out new infrastructure products that have been jointly developed by Dell and EMC teams, cross-selling them to clients of both, strengthening existing partnerships with firms like SAP AG, Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp., and forging new ones even with competitors like Amazon Web Services Inc. Dell executives say they are best suited to help clients go “digital” with the combined entity’s broad technology portfolio, which not only comprises computing products but also services and solutions in the areas of hybrid cloud, software-defined data centres and converged- and hyper-converged infrastructure (integration managed by software), platform-as-a-service, data analytics, mobility and cybersecurity. The Dell-EMC merger, announced last October, was the largest deal in tech history, topping Avago Technologies Ltd’s $37 billion purchase of Broadcom This multipronged strategy was evident when Dell took the stage at the first-ever Dell-EMC World 2016 event in Austin, Texas, on 18 October, and gave an impassioned speech that had all the trappings of a successful road map for next-gen computing. Beginning with a reiteration of the ‘Go Big or Go Home, Baby!’ slogan delivered at last year’s Dell event, he peppered this year’s speech with technology buzzwords like digital, the Internet of things (IoT), augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Alluding to Dell’s Digital Transformation Index , Dell underscored the presence of a “digital fear” among the 4,000 business leaders across 16 countries and 12 industries that were surveyed as part of a recent report. His pitch: “This (digital) future is coming very rapidly and the future does not care whether you are ready. But we do... (We are) the trusted provider of essential infrastructure for the next industrial revolution.” Dell evidently believes in economies of scale, made evident by his ‘Go Big…’ slogan. The Dell-EMC merger, announced last October, was the largest deal in tech history, topping Avago Technologies Ltd’s $37 billion purchase of Broadcom Corp. Dell Technologies is now a $74 billion company that comprises a PC business and affiliated businesses. Photo: Reuters Dell Technologies is now a $74 billion company that comprises a PC business and affiliated businesses including virtualization (the partitioning of a physical server into smaller virtual servers in a bid to reduce costs) company VMware Inc., security firms RSA Security Llc and SecureWorks Inc., software and services (including cloud and Big Data analytics) company Pivotal Software Inc., and cloud management software firm Virtustream Inc. Dell’s eponymous combined business now comprises two segments—Dell EMC is the sub-brand for the company’s enterprise business, including products and solutions, and Dell is the sub-brand for the company’s client solutions for consumers, business and institutional customers. Dell plans to go about the task of ramping up business growth also by touting that the combined company “stands as a market leader in many of the most important and high-growth areas of the information technology (IT) market, including positions as the ‘Leader’ in 20 Gartner Magic Quadrants and a portfolio of more than 20,000 patents and applications”. Does the pecking order bear out Dell’s claim? To be sure, the worldwide IT spending figure augurs well for technology companies like Dell Technologies, which figures in the top three in PCs, servers and storage. Overall IT spending is forecast to reach $3.5 trillion in 2017, up 2.9% from estimated spending of $3.4 trillion this year, according to Gartner Inc. According to the research firm, software and IT services segments have been the bright spots. Software spending is projected to grow 6% in 2016 and another 7.2% in 2017 to total $357 billion, while IT services spending is forecast to grow 3.9% in 2016 to $900 billion and 4.8% in 2017 to $943 billion.

EMC and HPE (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) accounted for 18.1% and 17.6% of spending, respectively, of the enterprise storage market (IDC declares a statistical tie when there is less than 1% difference in the revenue share of two or more vendors.). Dell held the next position with 11.5% share of revenue during the quarter. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and NetApp Inc. accounted for 6.8% and 6.7% of global spending, respectively. Sales of server-based storage were up 9.8% during the quarter and accounted for almost $2.4 billion in revenue. External storage systems remained the largest market segment, but the $5.7 billion in sales represented flat year-on-year growth. However, according to Liz Conner, research manager of storage systems at IDC, “…spending on all flash-based storage deployments continues to grow and help drive the market”, following the decreasing cost of flash media, deployments and availability of flash-based storage products (a sharp focus area for the combined entity, Dell Technologies). ALSO READ |In firms, PCs and smartphones coexist in a multi-device world: Michael Dell In the same period, worldwide server revenue declined 0.8% year-on-year, while shipments grew 2% from the second quarter of 2015, according to Gartner. Dell moved into the top spot in shipments, while HPE remained the worldwide leader in server revenue. Dell garnered 19.3% of the market and moved into the No. 1 position in worldwide server shipments due primarily to growth resulting from programmes it has in place in the Asia-Pacific region, most notably in China. HPE continued to lead the x86 server (Intel-based server) market in revenue with 26% of the market. IBM secured the third position with 9.1% of the market, but experienced the largest decline among the top five vendors, according to the Gartner report. Contrarian bets Notwithstanding the scepticism over the merger, there is certainly some merit in Dell’s claim over the economies of scale that this merger can achieve even as there remain formidable challenges that continue to keep some analysts and clients sceptical. The challenges include concerns over the sum paid for the acquisition, integration challenges, some overlap in products and technologies between Dell and EMC, leadership issues in the combined entity, and partnership conflicts since some Dell partners compete with EMC and VMware. “Michael has an opportunity to redefine computing if he reinvests on innovation and can pare back the debt,” said R ‘Ray’ Wang, principal analyst, founder and chairman of Silicon Valley-based Constellation Research Inc. He, however, pointed out that customers and partners remain sceptical, wondering “if this is an exercise to sell off the parts of the acquisition to pay down debt and save Dell, or a strategic play to own the cloud and the future of the data centre”. “Shedding the enterprise software assets leads us to believe that this may not be an innovation play yet but a move to sell off assets to save Dell. The experience at HP Enterprise is what customers are scared of. They don’t want to see their favourite vendors exit the market where massive investments have been made. The challenge is having two legacy players come together for innovation. The math in the accounting makes it hard to believe what innovations will come about. Dell did attempt to address this road map at Dell World but most of our clients remain sceptical,” said Wang. "Michael has an opportunity to redefine computing if he reinvests on innovation and can pare back the debt"- R.Ray Wang, primcipal, analyst,Conslellation Research, Silicon Vlley Dell is also a contrarian when it comes to defying certain technology trends. For instance, Dell became a private company on 5 February 2013, in a deal led by Silver Lake that was valued at $24.9 billion—the biggest leveraged buyout since the financial crisis—even as other tech firms seek stock market listings. Second, he believes in mergers and acquisitions even as competing companies like Hewlett Packard have split their businesses. Third, while the world is betting on smartphones, his company no longer makes them. “I don’t think the world needs another smartphone company,” says Dell. “A smartphone is just another node,” explains Dell, adding that “all the information you get on a smartphone comes from a data centre. And what you upload, goes back to the data centre”. This, for Dell, is a business opportunity since his company provides servers that are used by data centres. Wang agrees that the smartphone market is “a bad one to be in and is not worth it when you don’t own the OS (operating system)”. "Overnight, shipping will seem like snail mail compared to the instant gratification of drone delivery... AR and VR will redefine work, learning and play... Machine learning AI and unsupervised learning to all this data will unleash a torrent of innovation and progress and solve some of the world’s greatest challenges."- Michael Dell However, the fact is that even as Dell remains optimistic over the future of the PC (desktops and laptops), worldwide PC shipments totalled 68.9 million units in the third quarter of 2016, a 5.7% decline from the third quarter of 2015, according to the preliminary findings of Gartner. This was the eighth consecutive quarter of decline in PC shipments—the longest streak in the history of the PC industry. Lenovo Corp. continued to be the worldwide market leader based on preliminary PC shipments, but HP Inc. is nearly tied for this top spot. Segment-wise, Dell claims his company is No. 1 in PCs in terms of revenue but Dell ranked third in terms of shipments with a share of 13.5% in the third quarter of 2016. (All these rankings could change when final shipment results are published by Gartner.) Dell is insistent that revenue is more important than shipments. The fact is that even as Dell remains optimistic over the future of the PC, worldwide PC shipments totalled 68.9 million units in the third quarter of 2016, a 5.7% decline from the third quarter of 2015 Banking on innovation “We have been growing (the PC business) for 15 quarters. We want to be profitable so that we can reinvest in innovation,” he says. Part of his company’s “innovation” is around the “PC computing system”, as Jeff Clarke, vice- chairman of operations and president of client solutions, puts it. “There is much innovation in the PC computing system... like the computer becoming personal and new experiences with AR/VR that provide users with new ways to interact,” explains Clarke. In a 7 September blog, Clarke also points out that “…beyond the device, workforce transformation requires a cloud-based infrastructure to support people’s new behaviors, new devices and new expectations”, which EMC can provide. He also underscored the importance of Airwatch (now a Dell company) as an “EMM (enterprise mobility management) solution for managing phones and tablets”. “And with cloud client-computing VDI (virtual desktop infrastructure solutions) from VMWare, we are the only true end-to-end VDI provider in the industry, from planning to deployment, data center to the endpoint, on- and off-premise. Bottom line: Combining EMC’s cloud capabilities with our award-winning PCs, we have just created a very powerful solution,” wrote Clarke. For instance, the Dell-EMC product collaboration has resulted in products like VxRail—a hyper-converged infrastructure solution from VMware that includes fifth generation Intel Xeon processors and Dell’s PowerEdge servers. As opposed to a converged infrastructure model (also known as hardware-defined) where the server, networking and storage can be separated if needed, in a hyper-converged infrastructure (referred to as software-defined) the components are integrated and hence cannot be split. Dell-EMC product collaboration has resulted in products like VxRail—a hyper-converged infras solution from VMware that includes fifth generation Intel Xeon processors and Dell’s PowerEdge servers The other part of “innovation” revolves around Dell’s belief that IoT is “fundamentally changing businesses”. Explaining his rationale for why “we created Dell Technologies”, Dell says the planet is becoming “more intelligent and more connected by the minute, and ultimately will become intertwined with a vast Internet of Things, paving the way for our customers to do incredible things”. Dell elaborated in his speech that “as the cost of making something intelligent approaches zero dollars, intelligence is being embedded into every aspect of our physical world. We have about 8 billion connected devices on the planet, and 15 years from now there will be 200 billion or more, and all these sensors and nodes in those devices will provide access to a host of new digital applications, creating massive new sources of information.” Using this information to provide better insights and build a better world may be the biggest opportunity in history, he said. Using the premise that “everything improves about 10x every five years”, Dell in his speech also envisioned a future with smart cities, driverless cars and nanobots that cure cancer and repair cell damage. He added that “overnight shipping will seem like snail mail compared to the instant gratification of drone delivery... AR and VR will redefine work, learning and play... machine learning, deep learning, AI and unsupervised learning to all this data will unleash a torrent of innovation and progress and solve some of the world’s greatest challenges”. "As the cost of making something intelligent approaches zero dollars, intelligence is being embedded into every aspect of our physical world."- Michael Dell Towards this end, Dell and EMC have made a cumulative research and development (R&D) investment of $12.7 billion over the past three years and plan to invest $4.5 billion in R&D this year, “which is multiple times what the competition is investing”, Dell said. Dell, for instance, has invested in six worldwide global command centres where technicians constantly monitor events like flight delays, traffic jams, weather conditions, earthquakes or even unsettling events like riots that might impact the company’s ability to handle a support call. The technicians track live tweets, live broadcasts of news and weather, and map the location using geographical information systems and Google Earth—all in a single window using a customized interface. India (Bengaluru) does not have a global command centre but has a social media listening command centre. In June, Dell’s Extreme Scale Infrastructure group unveiled Triton—a liquid cooling technology that scores over traditional air-cooled solutions for data centres. It designed this water-based system to cool server chips (developed with Intel Corp.) in eBay.com’s data centres. Dell and EMC have made a cumulative R&D investment of $12.7 billion over the past three years and plan to invest $4.5 billion in R&D this year In an 18 October note, Mike Krell, lead IoT analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, agreed that Dell Technologies was “uniquely positioned to help customers solve their IoT puzzle”. Dell, Krell wrote, combines experience and credibility with specific vertical market enterprises, “a curated partner ecosystem with deep vertical knowledge, the industry’s broadest offering of IoT-focused infrastructure, and an ability to provide a world-class customer experience to help customers solve specific IoT problems—today”. But will ‘Go Big…’ work for Dell? Dell’s growth strategy also revolves around acquisitions, which Dell says will “continue”. Ever since Michael Dell returned to the company as its chief executive in 2007, the company has spent as much as $15 billion on more than 30 acquisitions prior to the $67 billion EMC purchase. These included EqualLogic ($1.4 billion; storage area networks, where EMC dominates), Perot Systems ($3.9 billion; IT services), SecureWorks ($612 million; security services, where EMC’s RSA division has a big presence), Force10 ($700 million; data centre Ethernet switches) and Quest Software ($2.4 billion; system management and security software), among others. Ever since Michael Dell returned to the company as its CEO in 2007, the firm has spent as much as $15 billion on more than 30 acquisitions prior to the $67 billion EMC acquisition However, not all of those acquisitions have done well for Dell, including some with a significant presence in the Indian market (security provider SonicWALL, for instance). According to a 20 June report on TechCrunch, while Dell had reportedly paid $3.6 billion for Quest Software and SonicWALL, it was only able to recoup around $2 billion for the duo when it sold them to private equity firm Francisco Partners and hedge fund Elliott Management. Dell also had to sell Perot Systems to Japan’s NTT Data Corp. for $3.1 billion in March. Nevertheless, analysts like Ashish Nadkarni, program director for IDC’s worldwide infrastructure practice, believe that “having a bigger, more full-service portfolio allows the combined company (Dell Technologies) to address a wide range of use cases in a very holistic fashion”. In a 16 April note, he pointed out that these solutions could be diverse and even emerging, like IoT and real-time analytics. “Dell and EMC can likewise take advantage of synergies when it comes to joint go-to-market efforts around compute, storage, and networking solutions,” wrote Nadkarni. He also believes that since Dell Technologies is a privately-held company, it will be able to offer the “flexibility of interesting product road maps and solutions as well as additional purchasing options, like subscription-based offerings, free from the 90-day shot clock pressures typically exerted on public companies”. "Dell Technologies, the newly formed merger of Dell Inc. and the EMC Federation, is uniquely positioned to help customers solve their IoT puzzle."- Mike Krell, lead IoT analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy On his part, Dell is clear that his company needs to “savour customer relationships”. He concludes: “There are many customers who do not want to change, and we don’t want to change them. There are plenty of opportunities for cross-selling. When we looked at the top 5,000 Dell customers and the top 5,000 EMC customers, we found only 1,000 common ones. So there are enormous opportunities to cross-sell among the portfolio. Customers are excited about that too—they actually like the fact that we are bringing everything together with these engineered and integrated solutions. That’s what we are focused on.” "Given the all-star teams we have in the combined Dell-EMC group, we have effectively an Olympic team."- Michael Dell Leslie D'Monte Topics: Dell EMC mergerDell TechnologiesMichael Dellcloud servicesPC business More from this Section Modi’s black money crackdown threatens corporate profit recovery Rishi Jaitly named CEO of Times Global Partners How bad is India’s corporate debt problem?

The Indian economy is doing well and the opportunities in IT, business technology and transformation are tremendous,” Dell Technologies chief executive Michael Dell said in an interview on the sidelines of Dell World 2016 in Austin, Texas. According to International Data Corporation, in the overall personal computer (PC) shipments for the April-June quarter, HP Inc. reclaimed its top spot with a 28.4% market share and Dell captured the second spot with 22.2%, “backed by focused efforts on growing branded consumer desktop category”.

In the India x86 (Intel-based servers) market, HP maintained its lead position in the October-December quarter of 2015 with 36% market share in terms of unit shipments, followed by Dell with a market share of 24% and Lenovo with 12%. EMC led in India’s external storage industry with a 28.4% market share in the January quarter. In an interview on 13 October, Alok Ohrie, president and managing director (India commercial business) at Dell EMC, insisted that the combined company is now “uniquely positioned” to provide customers with solutions that will secure their digital future with “a single window of engagement”. Other than PCs, server and data centre businesses, Dell India is partnering with a number of companies in areas like digitization and Digital India, which is all about getting people connected both from a device and from a network perspective, according to Ohrie. India is also the only country, outside of the US, where Dell has networking, storage and server research and development operations. Dell Technologies’ employee count in India is around 27,000 people. Dell does not break-up revenue by countries, but according to estimates by Dataquest, a Cyber Media (India) Ltd publication, Dell India’s revenue grew from Rs13,984 crore in FY15 to Rs17,480 crore in FY16, a rise of 25% (). Dataquest estimated EMC India revenue in FY15 to be Rs2,452 crore, a 15% rise over the previous fiscal year. If similar growth were to be assumed, the revenue for FY16 would come to about Rs2,819 crore, which would make the combined Dell-EMC India revenue a little over Rs20,000 crore. According to Tom Sweet, chief financial officer of Dell Technologies, the combined revenue of the two companies in India is “closer to $2.5 billion”.

In an interview on the sidelines of Dell World 2016 in Austin, Texas, on 19 October, Michael Dell, chairman and chief executive of the world’s largest privately-controlled technology company, Dell Technologies, shared his views on the prospects for the combined Dell-EMC. Edited excerpts: In a world of smartphones, you remain committed to a PC-centric world. Why? We listen to customers. I did not say that smartphones are not important. I believe it’s a multi-device world. In 2012, the idea was smartphones here and PCs there—it’s not correct now. In organizations, smartphones and PCs coexist in a multi-device world. The view around that time (that the) PC was dead created an opportunity for us. Many customers are not giving up on PCs. Liken this to transportation, where people use different modes like bicycles, cars, trains and planes. Computing is like that too with tablets, smartphones, PCs, etc. PCs offer another way of computing. But PCs, servers, storage, etc. are commoditized businesses... ...in the PC segment, we have gained share for 15 quarters in a row. We are doing very well, we are growing. When a commercial client chooses Dell PCs, it chooses us for the services and support and also Intel and AMD (Advanced Micro Devices Inc.) and Microsoft. It’s another way of saying these are our suppliers that have a higher share. Therefore, we should be more concerned about our suppliers if margin erosion is a concern. ALSO READ | Will Dell make it big with EMC? One of the reasons for our success is because we have brought tremendous value for our customers, democratized technology by making it more available and more affordable. There is no shortage of competitors in the business we are in. We need to provide high levels of service, continue to innovate, build great relationships and customers will reward us. How are you tackling issues around cultural challenges in the merged Dell-EMC entity? We had a decade-and-a-half lead-up to the combination. And it goes back to 2001 when we had announced an alliance called Dell EMC. The apparent intent was that Dell was going to sell EMC storage technologies to its customers. We did billions of dollars of sales. Under the cover, Dell server technology was embedded into pretty much every storage product line that existed and EMC became our largest OEM (original equipment manufacturer) customer in the world. And so our teams, beginning 2001, learnt how to work together in terms of supply chain, R&D, sales and importantly culture—we became friends. The businesses don’t have a lot of overlap. In 2009, we had a fairly in-depth look at whether we should combine the companies—reams of analyses, we had consultants from both companies, we had directors from the boards of both the public companies meeting secretly in places, and we were negotiating combining both the companies. However, because of the financial crisis at that time, we decided not to do so. "We need to provide high levels of service, continue to innovate, build great relationships and customers will reward us"- Michael Dell Then, in 2013, we took the company private. Everyone thought the PC was dead. So, we bought the company back. Thank you very much. And in 2014, I called my friend Joe Tucci (Joseph Tucci is the former chairman, president and chief executive officer of EMC) and said, “Why don’t we re-examine what we looked at five years earlier, refresh all the analyses and see if it makes sense now?” So, that was more than two years ago, which resulted in our October 2015 result. I got some great advice. I talked to a number of executives who had gone through a number of combinations like these—some had succeeded; some had failed. One of the things that a number of them said: You should as early you can, communicate the strategy of the new company and its structure. They also said, with all due respect to the current CEO of EMC, you should act as if you were leading the new company from the day of the announcement of the planned merger, not the closure date. Legally, you are not supposed to do that. And I didn’t break any laws. ALSO READ | Dell Technologies’s road map for India I was very present within EMC from the day of the announcement—at the leadership meetings, meeting the whole team, learning about the teams, and as we come together as one family and the cultures are a lot more similar than different. What’s the strategy you are employing to handle a smooth integration? We communicated the hierarchies within the organization to our teams. Not everyone has got exactly the job they want. Given the all-star teams we have in the combined Dell-EMC group, we effectively have an Olympic team. You must always start with the strategy. If you do it by personality or anything else, it will be a totally wrong way to do it. From the strategy, you must define the structure to achieve the strategy. You lay out the strategy. Then find out who are the people from within, or outside, the organization for each role to accomplish the strategy. For each role, you have several candidates. So you find the job—are you excited about the job, are you passionate. Some may want to play golf, instead. But if you are great and want to be part of the Olympic team, we have one heck of an opportunity for you.

Beyond the reviews, Phil Schiller or Phil the Philosopher is back on his stump preaching the Gospel of Apple about how touch displays are a temptation of the devil. It reminds me of the line in the movie Poltergeist, just don't look into the light! I've always liked Phil Schiller and was glad that Steve Jobs kept him on board as he cleaned house back in 1997. But at times I'd prefer if Phil just focused on what Apple does best without having to preach to me that what I may like is wrong. Apple sometimes reminds me of Hillary Clinton and the Democrats saying that if I'm not for open borders and allowing all illegals to flood into the country and stay, then I must be a racist xenophobe or at best a deplorable. It's what turned off many independents. She should have stayed on message of why to vote for her rather then telling me that I represented the dark side if I happened to disagree with her point of view. Sometimes Apple gets a little too preachy. Many Apple pros are still seething that the new MacBook Pro limits ports and forces them to use dongles. And Apple just decided they no longer wanted to support an SD Slot. Apple's apostles tell us that an SD slot is a tool of the devil and if we wanted it, then we'd surely turn into pillars of salt. So repent and go there no more.   A Few Quick Review Flashes on the Touch Bar   In Mossberg's review he notes that "I have reservations, and you should too. Many pro users are already vocally complaining about issues particular to them. But, even for mainstream Mac users, there are questions about price, ports, the Touch Bar feature, the keyboard and — surprisingly, for a Mac — battery life. Mossberg really slams Apple on battery life. On the Touch Bar, Mossberg notes that "I don't think the Touch Bar is a gimmick, but I don't think it changes much, at least yet, for everyday Mac users. The Touch Bar has potential, but it's not magic." Mossberg finally says that "if you're a Mac devotee ready to move past the Air — not back to a lower-powered MacBook — this is what Apple is offering. Take it or leave it." It's certainly a mixed review that you could fully check out here.   The Wall Street Journal's review by Joanna Stern starts off in your face: "We've been conditioned: Every new Apple Product is the best Apple Product ever… until, of course, the next best Apple Product ever. The exception? The new MacBook Pro laptops.   Even if you have enough spare cash to buy a Tesla for your kitten, it isn't abundantly clear that you should choose one of the new $1,500-and-up models over their predecessors. The new models even defy our expectations on power and pricing. Not only are they missing the newest Intel chipset, they don't even fit in the standard Apple-nomics model where hot new products slot in at last year's pricing.   On the Touch Bar Stern noted that "I can accomplish many shortcuts faster with the keyboard or trackpad. (Example: Cmd-B bolds words quicker than I can lift a finger to hit the Touch Bar's little "B.") Plus, you always have to look up since the controls keep changing and your sense of touch doesn't help at all."   The Bottom Line for Stern is one not to offend. Stern notes "So how do you decide? Do you invest in the present—the "old" MacBook Pro with performance, good-enough portability, a keyboard to cherish and lots of ports? Or do you invest in the future—a beautiful, highly portable machine with new tricks? Or maybe you do what I'm doing: Stare down at your three-year-old laptop and wonder if you can tough it out another year or two while this sorts itself out." Click here For more on the WSJ review.   Engadget's review by Dana Wollman was brutally honest. Dana notes that "I'm one of many Mac owners out there who has been waiting for Apple to upgrade the MacBook Pro line. Now that it finally has, I find the new laptop isn't quite what I wanted.   For me, this is both a step forward and a step backward. I'm sure Apple disagrees, and not just because its job is to sell lots of computers. Apple seems to earnestly believe it knows how people should be getting work done -- so much so that it has the chutzpah to ask loyal customers to unlearn old habits. Get used to using dongles to attach your existing accessories. Say goodbye to your memory card slot, creatives. Resign yourself to adjusting the brightness or volume with taps and swipes, instead of a simple button press. Accept the risk that your existing Thunderbolt 3 peripherals might not work.   On the Touch Bar, Wollman notes that "What's annoying about this whole setup is that either way, some of the most important system controls are now buried in Touch Bar menus. Want to lower the volume? You can either hit the volume icon and hit the slider, or hit the arrow key and tap the volume up or down key. That's less efficient than just pressing a dedicated volume button in the function row. It's inconvenient enough that I eventually started using my mouse to do things like pause Spotify or raise the volume on a track. Apple made me change my way of doing things, and not necessarily for the better. That pisses me off."   Although Wollman complains, she knows that die-hard Apple will flock to it and it gives it a decent 8 out of 10 score.   On the Touch Bar, the review by The Verge was mixed. "I've been using the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar for more than a week now, and I have mixed feelings about what it brings to the MacBook experience. In some cases, the Touch Bar's usefulness is obvious and immediate. But in many others, it's overly complicated or just plain unnecessary. It's an addition that very much can improve every MacBook — but it's going to take some time to get there, if it ever does."   Phil the Philosopher   Back in 2012 Samsung's Phablet had been out for about a year and Apple's VP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller wanted to downplay what many consumers were running to, the Phablet. So Schiller put on his preacher's robe and went into Phil the Philosopher mode. Patently Apple's report at the time noted that "In Describing the new iPhone, Phil Schiller stated that "It is really easy to make a new product that's bigger. Everyone does that. The challenge is to make it better and smaller."   Schiller went on to make an obvious point that Samsung forgot: "What is the design center for a Phone? It's this: it's your hand. A phone should feel great in your hand and more importantly it should be easy to use with a magical device we all carry called the horizontally opposed thumb. It does most of the hard work for us. So when you carry your phone it should feel beautiful in your hand."   As one who liked the phablet idea right out of the gate, I found it funny to listen to Phil having to defend Apple's position. More more importantly, Phil basically tried to convey the message that we just didn't get it, and if we happened to like a phablet, then surely we had lost our way.   According to Phil, my thumb had to be satisfied and that could only happen on a tiny iPhone display. Keep in mind that this isn't me conveniently looking back with 20/20 hindsight. I reported on this back in 2013 after Apple had missed delivering a phablet for a second year in a row in a report titled "Apple Passing on a larger iPhone Display still a Head Scratcher."   Well, Apple is back at it again and Phil the Philosopher is there to just lay down the law and to set us all straight. When it came to dropping ports and the SD slot that Pro users loved, Phil was there to slap them on that back and make it very clear that Apple cares "about what they love and what they are worried about. And it's our job to help people through these changes." Yes, true, at a cost and inconvenience of having multiple dongs on our desks like our cover graphic illustrates. That's helping us through the changes? Ka-ching for Apple.   It's not what Apple fans or pros wanted from a new MacBook Pro, but hey, Phil will help us through these changes because we're all just morons who just don't get it. We just don't see the light of genius in changing every port so that they look alike and are more importantly, nice and neat in a row! You know, it's just so condescending and yet I'm sure it's done with a smile. Thanks Phil.   Of course the biggest in our face position that Apple won't budge on is giving us a MacBook or iMac with a touch display. That argument should be dead by now but the tech community of writers never let it go. It's obvious that these writers and Apple fans would still like to see that come to be. But Apple continues to say that god handed them down the law on stone tablets like Moses. Phil, it's doable because Windows 10 proved it's doable so it just comes down to ideology and not because it's absurd as you claim it to be.    You know, it reminds me of people who have to eat each thing on their plate in a particular order never mixing a damn thing. Their brain isn't wired to enjoy peas and potatoes together in one scoop. It just isn't the order of things in their universe.   In a new report today Phil told Backchannel that "We think of the whole platform. If we were to do Multi-Touch on the screen of the notebook, that wouldn't be enough — then the desktop wouldn't work that way." And touch on the desktop, he says, would be a disaster. Can you imagine a 27-inch iMac where you have to reach over the air to try to touch and do things? That becomes absurd."   How many times have I been at my kitchen table in the evening and just leaned over to touch the Safari or iTunes icon on my iMac like I do on my iPad to launch an app, just to laugh at what I was doing because my iMac was of course just too stupid to do that. What was I thinking, that we could have it both ways like on Windows devices?   Yet at the end of the day, most Apple fans will appreciate Apple's MacBook Pro with its new Touch Bar. On the other hand, many reviewers and fans couldn't care less about the Touch Bar, and some like me would still prefer a hybrid notebook-tablet like the invention that Apple's engineers came up with; their intelligent engineers that had their idea stolen from them by Microsoft's Surface Book. But when I get a Surface Book someday in the future, I'll always think of those Apple engineers and say thanks guys, too bad Apple didn't listen to you because it was a great idea.     Roundup of More In-Depth MacBook Pro Reviews   Philosophy aside, if you're trying to decide on whether to pass or buy that shiny new MacBook Pro for Christmas and need a nudge either way, below are a few more interesting and more in-depth reviews that might help you decide:   Ars Technica: Touch Bar MacBook Pros give an expensive glimpse at the Mac's future USA Today: MacBook Pro review: Touch Bar comes at high cost AppleInsider: Review: Apple's late-2016 15" MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Gizmodo: The MacBook Pro's Touch Bar Is a Gimmick That's Not Worth the Money (Yet) Mashable: Apple's MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is worth the wait Macworld: MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review: The best bits of iOS in a really great Mac --- They love the new Touch Bar as noted below in their overview video.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

As with other external graphics enclosures, the AKiTiO Node allows a user to easily upgrade the graphics sub-system of notebook, AIO or SFF PCs that have a Thunderbolt 3 port by using a discrete graphics card. One of the key elements to eGFX is price and look, and AKiTiO has placed the Node at $299, but itcan fit graphics cards with massive coolers. Enthusiasts started to experiment with external graphics over Thunderbolt 2 interface several years ago after multiple attempts of companies like ATI/AMD, ASUS and some others to develop commercial external GPU technologies had failed. Back in 2014, plugging a video card to a MacBook Pro using Thunderbolt 2 was costly: users had to buy a chassis for up to $1000 (there were cheaper methods, but they did not look solid), a PSU and a graphics board. The homebrew method worked, but had a number of limitations when it came to bandwidth, hot-plugging (more importantly, unplugging), driver support and some others, not to mention the aesthetics of such eGFX setups. Given the trend towards miniaturization of mobile and desktop PCs, the idea of external graphics was far too alluring to skip, which is why Intel decided to support it with its Thunderbolt 3 technology introduced in 2014. While technically TB3 is PCIe 3.0 x4 over a cable, to properly enable operation of external GPUs, Intel and its allies had to ensure support of eGFX hardware though operating systems, GPU drivers, firmware and so on. Earlier this year all pieces of the puzzle finally came together and the first “official” TB3 eGFX chassis were introduced by Razer and PowerColor. While both Razer Core and PowerColor Devil Box do the job and even feature a couple of extras, they are rather expensive as they add more than just GPU features - $499 and $379, respectively. This week, AKiTiO, which has been offering external Thunderbolt enclosures for years, introduced its eGFX box that costs $299.99.

The Node comes with an integrated 400 W SFX PSU (which means that it can be upgraded) as well as one 120 mm fan. As for dimensions, the Node seems to be a little more spacious inside than its rivals, which is good for cooling and compatibility with custom video cards (such as those from ASUS or EVGA). Despite this, GPUs with hybrid cooling (integrated liquid cooling) are not supported, such as AMD Radeon R9 Fury X.

It does not have extra USB 3.0 ports (to connect a VR headset, for example), a GbE controller nor a SATA connector. This naturally cuts down its costs and allows Akito to sell the eGFX enclosure at $299 price-point, but additional USB ports will be greatly missed by owners of ultra-thin laptops as well as SFF PCs. AKiTiO plans to start selling the Node (NODE-T3IA-AKTU) in December.

POST A COMMENT 47 Comments View All Comments jsntech - Monday, November 14, 2016 - link In my opinion, this is the future of a pretty decent slice of the market. The emergence of several of these (especially like this one with a standard TB3 connection) is pretty encouraging. Not holding my breath, but sure would also be nice if Apple ever decided to create drivers supporting eGPUs...might actually provide incentive for developers to consider macOS for more demanding GPU-intensive applications (dare I say, VR?). Like I said, not holding my breath... Reply MadDuffy - Monday, November 14, 2016 - link I'd have agreed with you when thunderbolt came out and the potential seemed so high (five years ago). But now we have faster wireless networking and streaming tech, so these boxes aren't reasonable for most gaming purposes when you could just spend 300 dollars and get a desktop. Reply MadDuffy - Monday, November 14, 2016 - link Competition is good, though. Get the prices down! Reply rhysiam - Monday, November 14, 2016 - link Does anyone know what Intel is actually charging for the TB3 controllers? It must be a lot, because we still only see TB on higher end mobos and portables. That seems like it's going to be the biggest problem for this market. If you can pop one of these boxes into just about any modern laptop, then they've got a good chance. But if things stay as they are now, and you have to carefully choose and pay more for a TB3 laptop, then overpay for these enclosures (you could literally buy a case, PSU & entire motherboard for half the price of this TB3 enclosure)... then I can't see these ever becoming anything other than niche products suiting people who are prepared to pay significantly more for the particular benefits they bring. The other problem, I suspect, is that we're seeing an increasing number of manufacturers producing pretty competent portable gaming laptops. Some of the recent 14" & 15" inch laptops with GTX 1060s, while of course bulkier than an ultrabook, still manage to be both relatively portable (~2/3" thick and under 4lbs) and extremely competent gaming machines. Many, as well, do this while costing far less in a single package than the laptop + GPU enclosure + GPU approach. We no longer live in a world where the only competent gaming laptops are 12lbs+ monstrosities. Obviously there's a market for these enclosures, it just seems that with capable ~4lb gaming laptops, it's a pretty niche market. Reply twtech - Monday, November 14, 2016 - link I think the best use for these is paired with an ultrabook that has a capable CPU but uses integrated graphics. The ultrabook has long battery life so you can do the types of basic tasks you typically want to be able to do while mobile - browse the internet, check email, work on documents, etc. Then when you want to sit down and play a game - which you'd usually do plugged in anyway - you plug into an external box like this (but preferably with those additional ports), that charges your laptop, provides connectivity for your external monitors, input devices, add-on storage for your game library, etc. So basically you can get the best of both worlds. I'm saying this from the perspective of someone who has owned gaming laptops in the past, and never really had a need or desire to use them as such while travelling - but I did wish I had better battery life and a more portable machine. Reply bronan - Tuesday, November 15, 2016 - link Log in which port you want to try to plugin ... The ultrabooks i have seen only have 1 port available for EVERYTHING Reply Eden-K121D - Tuesday, November 15, 2016 - link $8.5 Reply 1_rick - Monday, November 14, 2016 - link I carry my Skull canyon NUC between work and home nearly every day, as it's a far superior desktop the one my work got me. With an external GPU I could game on it at home in high quality. $300 for an enclosure is painful, though. I lost the link but a while ago I saw an external adapter, not an enclosure, that was about $130 with external PSU. Reply bronan - Tuesday, November 15, 2016 - link You actually should read the test reviews it does not do wonders at all. If you expect desktop performance you better buy a real home pc and put in a decent card which performs as it should. You get mediocre laptop performance even if you put a monster card in that box. Reply negusp - Tuesday, November 15, 2016 - link BS. It does do wonders for CPU-capable machines/laptops. The Skull Canyon NUC has a very capable CPU, and an external GPU would run just as fast as a normal GPU connected via PCI-E.

The former minister under whose watch the National Health Insurance was introduced is indicating that the biometric device has not been programmed to track voters in the entire constituency of the various polling centres hence, a voter can still have his or her details in other polling stations within the same constituency after voting at his or her original polling centre. It, therefore, opens the door for multiple voting, the former minister alleged while speaking in an interview with Kwame Tutu on Rainbow Radio. He said, unlike the Nigerian Biometric Verification system which is able to identify registered voters at all polling centres aside the original centre they registered, Ghana’s system, he noted, is volatile and could be a possible scheme to rig the process. According to him, it is an Intel he has picked and has therefore called on the Electoral Commission (EC) of Ghana to rectify the issue before the election takes off. Dr. Owusu Afriyie further admonished the EC to ensure that Ghanaians and their stakeholders, in particular, trust them in organising a clean, transparent and credible polls. The 2016 general elections, he noted, should be the exact representation of the electorates who will go to the polls to elect a leader of their choice and party with that fair process and for the EC to prevent any form of doubt that will may compromise the polls. The EC has assured Ghanaians that it will organise a clean, fair and credible elections. The first female commissioner of the EC, Mrs. Charlotte Osei, had said that every polling station will be allocated two biometric verification devices to avert the challenges that plagued the 2012 elections as a result of a breakdown of many of the machines. In 2012, some polling centres were forced to postpone voting because the verification device broke down. “If one has a problem or breaks down, we will switch to the second one. There is a backup we will bring from the constituency level to support that polling station,” the EC Chair explained. The EC chair added, “The reason being that we want fewer people on the register of every polling station so there is less pressure on the machines and less pressure on the personnel. Hopefully, voting will finish earlier and we can finish the collation earlier and declare the results.” The biometric system of voting was introduced in Ghana and was used in the 2012 presidential and parliamentary elections. Biometric voter registration involves use of computers, fingerprint scanners and digital cameras to capture the bio-data of applicants. Fingerprints are unique to every individual and it is these unique features and other details that will be stored in the computer from which the voters register is produced. The biometric system was introduced because the old form of voting was not able to detect multiple registrations.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News World's Largest Student Cyber Security Contest Names Winners BROOKLYN, N.Y., Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ — Students from high schools through doctoral programs throughout North America, the Middle East, North Africa, and India competed in the final rounds of the world’s largest student-run security games, the 13th annual New York University Cyber Security Awareness Week (NYU CSAW), held November 12-14, 2016. For the first time in the history of NYU CSAW, the final round of contests expanded beyond NYU Tandon School of Engineering in Downtown Brooklyn to regional hubs at NYU Abu Dhabi – for finalists from North Africa and the Middle East – and the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT Kanpur). Continue Reading To solve the fictional murder mystery posed in the 2016 NYU CSAW High School Forensics Contest, students had to examine evidence in an LG smart watch donated by Google. Cyber Security Awareness Week, the world’s largest student-run cybersecurity contests, was held Nov. 10-12 at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, NYU Abu Dhabi, and the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. Finalists bested more than 10,000 students from more than 100 countries who competed remotely in preliminary rounds of six separate competitions. The best high school cyber sleuths tangled in the final rounds for over $1 million in scholarships.  Additionally, the NYU Center for Cyber Security will offer doctoral scholarships and fellowships to the NYU Tandon School of Engineering to college-level finalists who prevailed against student hackers and researchers at NYU CSAW’s three hubs. Capture the Flag For the signature event of NYU CSAW, Capture the Flag (CTF), 34 teams from a preliminary field of more than 2,500 teams earned finalist slots in Brooklyn, Abu Dhabi, and Kanpur. Fifteen undergraduate teams in the United States, eight in the United Arab Emirates, and 11 in India competed in notoriously difficult final-round hacking challenges that lasted 36 consecutive hours. In Brooklyn, a CTF challenge created by tech firm Vector 35 required contestants to reverse engineer a derivation of the popular Pokémon Go game. Players had to hack the game so that they could amass in hours a score that would normally take weeks or even months to achieve. “To do that requires real-world network analysis and program reverse-engineering skills,” said Jordan Wiens, CTF judge and co-founder of Vector 35. “These are the same kinds of tools the data security world has a dramatic need for right now.” Unemployment in cybersecurity hovers near zero, and according to estimates by Cisco, there are one million cybersecurity job vacancies this year alone, including more than 200,000 in the United States. Frost & Sullivan, in an often-cited report, predicts 1.5 million unfilled security positions worldwide by 2020. The team 1064 Shellphish from the University of California (Santa Barbara) featured brothers Brandon and Andrew Dutcher. Andrew had competed in the CTF team 1064CBread, which won second place in 2015, when all members were graduates or students of Dos Pueblos High School in Goleta, California. John Grosen, who was also on that original 1064CBread team, is now a freshman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and competed with MIT’s CTF team Don’t Hack Alone. His brother Paul, who competed last year as a freshman on Dos Pueblos High School’s High School Forensics (HSF) team 1064CBread, returned this year as well. The team became the first HSF competitor to place in NYU CSAW’s rigorous Department of Homeland Security Quiz. For the eighth consecutive year in Brooklyn, a team from Carnegie Mellon took top honors in the CSAW CTF. NYU Tandon Winners: First place: PPP1, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh Team members: Tim Becker, Corwin de Boor, Samuel Kim, Matthew Savage Second place: RPISEC, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York Team members: Nick Burnett, Joshua Ferrell, Kareem El-Faramawi, Branden Clark Third place: Batman’s Kitchen, University of Washington, Seattle       Team members: Dan Arens, Stanley Hsieh, Alex Kirchhoff, Bo Wang NYU Abu Dhabi Winners: First place: dcua2, Mundiapolis University, Morocco Team members: Amine Cherrai, Bilal Kardadou, Ilyas Rahmani, Mohammed Belcaid Second place: MrAdmin, ENSIAS, Morocco  Team members: Anass Bouchnafa, Azzeddine Djekmani, Oualid Zaazaa, Yaakoub Najih Third place: DC21321, Bordj Bou Arreridj University, Algeria          Team members: Adel Merabet, Mohamed Zehraoui, Ramzi Bourahli IIT Kanpur Winners: First place: InfoSecIITR, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee Second place: Bi0s, Amrita University Third Place: d4rkc0de, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi Embedded Security Challenge This year’s hardware security competition — the most difficult hacking event at NYU CSAW — brought five finalists to Brooklyn, seven to NYU Abu Dhabi and two to IIT Kanpur. The challenge was designed by a team of top NYU security faculty and students mentored by NYU Assistant Professor Michail Maniatakos and Nektarios Tsoutsos, a computer science doctoral candidate studying under Maniatakos at NYU Abu Dhabi. Using special chipsets supplied by CSAW sponsor Intel, teams were tasked with modifying a configurable microchip to make it immune to memory corruption, a common attack used by hackers. To qualify for the final round, teams submitted papers describing the techniques they would use to enhance a basic chip design so that memory corruption could not harm the system. In Brooklyn, first place went to a team from the University of Central Florida (UCF), which has produced podium winners for the past five years. UCF fielded teams that won first place in 2014 and 2012, and second place last year and in 2013.

Cabrera, chief cybersecurity officer of Trend Micro. Lucie Hayward, managing consultant at Kroll, led “Women in Cybersecurity: Decrypt your Future,” a workshop for students and professionals. For the first time CSAW included a one-day workshop on open source security software, “Security: Open Source.” Organized by Brendan Dolan-Gavitt, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at NYU Tandon, the workshop featured developers discussing their software and how it has been used to solve real-world security problems. The yearly career fair featured 20 prominent institutions that came to entice the talented students competing in CSAW and other cybersecurity students in the greater New York area for internships and full-time positions. Closing NYU CSAW was Neil Hershfield, deputy section manager of Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, who spoke about the threat posed by control system malware and the dearth of analysts with control systems expertise. NYU students and volunteer judges spend months preparing challenges and organizing NYU CSAW, which has grown from an internal event at the school to one of the best known competitions for students. This year it was supported by 26 sponsors. For more information on CSAW, visit csaw.engineering.nyu.edu. Follow @CSAW_NYUTandon.

The challenge was designed by a team of top NYU security faculty and students mentored by NYU Assistant Professor Michail Maniatakos and Nektarios Tsoutsos, a computer science doctoral candidate studying under Maniatakos at NYU Abu Dhabi. Using special chipsets supplied by CSAW sponsor Intel, teams were tasked with modifying a configurable microchip to make it immune to memory corruption, a common attack used by hackers. To qualify for the final round, teams submitted papers describing the techniques they would use to enhance a basic chip design so that memory corruption could not harm the system. In Brooklyn, first place went to a team from the University of Central Florida (UCF), which has produced podium winners for the past five years. UCF fielded teams that won first place in 2014 and 2012, and second place last year and in 2013.

Cabrera, chief cybersecurity officer of Trend Micro. Lucie Hayward, managing consultant at Kroll, led “Women in Cybersecurity: Decrypt your Future,” a workshop for students and professionals. For the first time CSAW included a one-day workshop on open source security software, “Security: Open Source.” Organized by Brendan Dolan-Gavitt, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at NYU Tandon, the workshop featured developers discussing their software and how it has been used to solve real-world security problems. The yearly career fair featured 20 prominent institutions that came to entice the talented students competing in CSAW and other cybersecurity students in the greater New York area for internships and full-time positions. Closing NYU CSAW was Neil Hershfield, deputy section manager of Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, who spoke about the threat posed by control system malware and the dearth of analysts with control systems expertise. NYU students and volunteer judges spend months preparing challenges and organizing NYU CSAW, which has grown from an internal event at the school to one of the best known competitions for students. This year it was supported by 26 sponsors. For more information on CSAW, visit csaw.engineering.nyu.edu. Follow @CSAW_NYUTandon.

Fast forward to today and Nvidia's GTX 10-series range has surfaced and manufacturers are all hurrying to introduce refreshed models. Quick off the mark is EVGA, who is giving its first-ever gaming laptop, the SC17, a makeover by swapping the GeForce GTX 980M found in the launch model for an up-to-date GeForce GTX 1070. The 10-series GPU is the headline announcement, and it seems little else has changed. We'd encourage readers to pore over our in-depth review of the launch SC17 for the finer details, as a lot of what was true back then is still applicable to the 1070 refresh. Dimensions haven't changed, with the 17.3in machine measuring 408mm x 296mm x 26.6mm, and the unit still tips the scales at a considerable 4.1kg. EVGA's aluminium frame offers a robust feel, yet while it's reasonably thin for a gaming laptop, the weight prevents it from being portable and the black paintwork continues to attract fingerprints en masse. From the outside, you'd do well to tell the models apart. The 1070 refresh looks identical with a power connector, Gigabit Ethernet, HDMI and two mini-DisplayPorts lining the left edge, as well as a headphone jack, two USB 3.0 ports and USB 3.1 Type-C on the right. Thunderbolt, an SD card reader and one or two more USB ports would have been nice on a system of this size, though EVGA does offer a USB Type-C-to-USB 3.0 adaptor as part of the bundle. All of the original SC17's highlights remain intact, including a 4K IPS display identified as the 17.3in Sharp SHP145E, a proper UEFI firmware that better resembles a desktop solution, and of course a 'SuperClock' mode that allows for the laptop to be overclocked via a quick keyboard shortcut. Such features offer genuine appeal to the target enthusiast audience, though if you were hoping to see a few other upgrades, you may be disappointed to find that G-Sync display technology still isn't an option. The sense of familiarity continues under the hood, where EVGA employs many of the same core components. Tucked into the svelte frame is an Intel Core i7-6820HK processor, 32GB (2x16GB) of G.Skill DDR4-2666 memory, a 256GB Samsung M.2 NVMe SSD, a 1TB hard disk and an Intel AC-8260 adapter for WiFi and Bluetooth. Nothing new there, but the big change of course is in the GPU department, with the outgoing GTX 980M having been replaced by the GeForce GTX 1070. The 16nm Pascal chip features one more SM unit than its desktop counterpart, resulting in 2,048 shaders and 128 texture units. Lower clock speeds balance things out, and in terms of performance, we've reached the point where the gap between desktop and mobile parts has all but disappeared. Turn the SC17 1070 on and the CPU and GPU are configured to default clock speeds of up to 3,600MHz and 1,645MHz, respectively. EVGA's party trick is a quick-and-easy overclock. Hit the SuperClock shortcut (Fn and Up Arrow) and the CPU is instantly lifted to 4,000MHz while the GPU's boost frequency climbs from 1,645MHz to 1,683MHz. No restart is required, and though power consumption, heat output and noise are all likely to increase, it's an easy way to eke out more performance when the going gets tough. Aside from the GPU, have there been any other significant changes? Well, the price tag isn't what it used to be. Whereas the original SC17 arrived at retail carrying a lofty £2,400 MSRP, the SC17 1070 has raised the asking fee to a jaw-dropping £2,900. For that amount of money you might anticipate a GTX 1080 and G-Sync as standard, but then, given that even Toblerone isn't what it used to be, perhaps we're just going to have to get used to paying more than expected?
