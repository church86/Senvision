Read more about the stories in today's news: Yahoo Earnings Report Shows Ad Revenue Still Eroding Intel Record Q3 Revenue Offset by Disappointing Forecast Dell EMC Brings PowerEdge Servers to VxRail, VxRack Google Enables Web Support for Firebase Cloud Messaging       Today's topics include the continued decline of Yahoo's desktop advertising revenue, Intel's strong quarterly revenue report masks weaker prospects, hyperconverged data center products from Dell EMC, and Google's new support for Firebase Cloud Messaging. Yahoo canceled its quarterly conference call with analysts this week, leaving questions about its financial wellbeing and data security unanswered. While its reported earnings exceeded expectations, the company's primary source of revenue—desktop advertising—dropped for the seventh time in the past eight quarters. According to Yahoo, it canceled the talk because of the pending offer in July from Verizon Communications to buy the web company for $4.8 billion. While a recent 14 percent drop in core ad revenue was a likely topic, Yahoo is also avoiding questions about last month's news that hackers broke into its data stores and stole about 500 million personal account information packages. Intel saw a strong Q3 in most of its business segments, but the outlook might not be as positive. The chip-making company's most recent quarterly financial numbers showed record revenue of $15.8 billion—a 9 percent increase over the same 2015 period. Profits also grew 9 percent, with growth not only in Intel's data center and internet of things divisions, but even in the slower PC business. However, the global PC market is continuing to contract as mobile devices rise in popularity, and analysts with both IDC and Gartner say that worldwide shipments for PCs fell significantly in the third quarter. As a result, Intel's overall business growth is projected to slow in the coming quarters. Ten months ago, Dell announced it would buy data storage vendor EMC for more than $60 billion. The deal closed in September, and now the two tech vendors have revealed the groundwork for how they're merging their respective product portfolios. The highlight of their work, revealed at Dell EMC World 2016, has been the hyperconverged infrastructure offerings. The Dell PowerEdge servers have been integrated into the VxRail and VxRack systems inherited in the EMC deal. Hyperconverged systems like these offer compute, storage, networking, virtualization and management software resources in an appliance that's easy to manage. Starting this week, Google's Firebase Cloud Messaging technology can be used to push notifications from software applications and services to browsers outside Chrome, including Firefox and Opera, all through a JavaScript library Google recently implemented. Software developers push notifications to build engaging experiences—offering updates or special offers—but they can be difficult to implement on the web. The FCM web support aims to address those challenges directly. FCM had previously been limited to Android, iOS and Chrome browser apps.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile iPhone 7s with Intel modems struggle badly in low-signal areas iPhone 7s with Intel modems struggle badly in low-signal areas By Joel Hruska on October 20, 2016 at 4:23 pm Comment Apple has a reputation for tight supply chain management and demanding rigorous quality control, but the company may have a modem problem on its hands. Previously, Apple has tapped both Samsung and TSMC to build its SoCs, but stuck with the same Qualcomm modem for all its hardware. With the iPhone 7, Apple adopted an Intel modem for its AT&T and T-Mobile variants, while the factory-unlocked devices, Sprint, and Verizon hardware all use Qualcomm’s modem silicon (MDM9645M if you want to get technical). According to an analysis performed by Cellular Insights, both devices perform equally well if you have a strong signal, but the Intel modem (XMM7360, pictured at top) drops off significantly as signal strength weakens. Cellular Insights tested multiple LTE bands (Band 4, 7, and 12) in a 4×2 MIMO configuration. The graph below is from Band 4, which Cellular Insights describes as the most common band for North America LTE deployments. Image and data by Cellular Insights RSRP is a measure of LTE signal strength and is expected to range from ~-75dBm when measured directly on top of a cellular base site to -120dBm at the edge of coverage. What we see here is that the Intel modem can’t sustain the same throughput as the Qualcomm device, particularly at the -105dBm threshold. At -115dBm, the gap between the Intel and Qualcomm modems is roughly 2x — meaning the Qualcomm device is sustaining about twice the network throughput on the same signal strength. Cellular Insights also compared the two devices against the Galaxy S7 Edge, the iPhone 6s, the LG G5, and the Nexus 5X. Image and data by Cellular Insights First of all, kudos to Samsung; the S7 Edge does extremely well in all cases. The Intel XMM7360, in contrast, is the worst overall performer of the lot — though the 6s doesn’t exactly distinguish itself well, either. That might explain why Apple was willing to work with Intel in the first place, but the Intel XMM7360 doesn’t keep up with Qualcomm’s MDM9645M. It would be interesting to see a battery life comparison between Intel and Qualcomm devices and it’s possible that Apple could improve the Intel modem’s performance via a software update. If you really care about LTE performance on an iPhone or live in an area with marginal LTE coverage, the factory-unlocked version of the device is definitely your best bet — right now, the Intel modem isn’t performing where it ought to be. Winning the iPhone 7 was a huge victory for Intel’s beleaguered modem division, but that victory was predicated on the idea that the Intel and Qualcomm modems would offer equal performance. So far, that doesn’t seem to be the case. It’s not clear how much this impacts the iPhone 7’s range, network timeouts, or other issues that might arise in areas where cellular connectivity is weak, but the general implication is that the Qualcomm modem offers better performance and possibly better range when operating in low-signal areas.

If you want the best iPhone 7, you need to get the one with a Qualcomm modem. According to a new study by Cellular Insights, the Qualcomm iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus units—that's the Verizon, Sprint and factory-unlocked models—have more than 30 percent better performance in weak signal conditions than the AT&T and T-Mobile models, which have Intel modems. Cellular Insights bought several iPhones at retail, and hooked them up to a box that simulates cellular networks to eliminate variables. We don't have that expensive equipment here. They tested the iPhones on LTE band 4—which is used by AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon—as well as band 12, which is used by AT&T and T-Mobile. Both models of iPhone work equally well in strong signal conditions. We couldn't tell the difference with good signal, Cellular Insights couldn't, and you won't be able to, either. But when the signal weakened to about -105dBm—think of that as one bar of signal—the testers saw a major difference. At -110dBm on Band 4, the Qualcomm iPhone pushed 100Mbps while the Intel iPhone only reached 60Mbps, the report says. "In all tests, the iPhone 7 Plus with the Qualcomm modem had a significant performance edge over the iPhone 7 Plus with the Intel modem," the report says. There are some other shenanigans going on, too. Qualcomm's X12 modem supports a coding scheme called 256 QAM, which further speeds up LTE connections. That hasn't been activated on the iPhone 7, possibly to level the playing field with the Intel modem, which doesn't have the feature. //Related Articles If You Want to Switch Carriers, Buy Verizon's iPhone 7 "Ironically, mobile operators such as T-Mobile USA and Telstra, which have been offering these advanced LTE features, are being supplied with the iPhone 7 with the Intel modem," the report says. If this makes you ask the question of why Apple decided to go with an inferior Intel modem in the first place, you're not alone. Apple isn't saying. But as I've spoken to independent analysts, a picture became clear. Qualcomm is the leader in LTE, and Apple has been using their modems since the iPhone 4s generation. But Qualcomm tends to drive hard bargains. Intel hasn't had a big modem win with its XMM7360 devices before, so the company may have been an easier partner for Apple to deal with. That said, for consumers, the choice is clear: if you care about getting the best connection with weak signal on your iPhone, it's worth grabbing one of those unlocked models from the Apple Store. They will have the superior Qualcomm modem. Back to top Previous : Verizon Gets Its First Mediatek-Powered Phone, the LG Stylo ...

X Intel wins support in battle to overturn EU antitrust fine European court’s final decision could affect Apple fight over €13bn Irish tax bill Thu, Oct 20, 2016, 17:22 Intel, based in Santa Clara, California. The technology giant has been fighting to overturn a €1.06bn EU antitrust fine. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg         Intel’s fight to overturn a record €1.06 billion European Union antitrust fine received a boost from an adviser to the bloc’s top court in a case that could have ramifications for a growing list of disputes involving US tech giants, from Google to Apple. Intel’s appeal should be totally re-examined by a lower court, which blundered by ruling against the company’s system of rebates for PC makers using its chips, advocate general Nils Wahl of the European Court of Justice said in a nonbinding opinion on Thursday. The top court will decide whether to back his views in a ruling expected within six months. “If the court follows, this could be the most important ruling of the past 25 years because it’s the complete destruction of the judgment of the General Court, but also of the European Commission’s position,” said Damien Geradin, a lawyer at Edge Legal in Brussels. The lower tribunal was wrong to single out “exclusivity rebates” paid to customers who bought most or all of their chips from Intel, he said. The General Court’s analysis failed to show that the rebates harmed competition. The commission in Brussels and Intel declined to comment. Spotlight on Apple A victory for Intel would throw the spotlight on EU antitrust regulators facing a court clash with Ireland and Apple over the fairness of an investigation that culminated in the iPhone maker facing a €13 billion tax bill. The Intel ruling may also affect the EU’s handling of investigations into Google and Qualcomm that could ultimately lead to fines. Hines emerges as top bidder for student residence beside UCD Bank of Ireland ‘will utilise any relaxation of mortgage rules’ €700 per sq m rent for top D2 offices Intel’s 2009 antitrust fine was the EU’s biggest, more than double the €497 million penalty against Microsoft in 2004. It represented about 4 per cent of Intel’s $37.6 billion in sales in 2008, below the maximum penalty of 10 per cent of yearly sales that regulators can impose. ADVERTISEMENT In light of “the errors committed” by the General Court, Mr Wahl said a final ruling by the top tribunal was not possible at this stage. “That is because a decision on the merits hinges upon the examination of all the circumstances of the case,” he said, and of “the actual or potential effect of Intel’s conduct on competition” in the EU. If Intel ultimately prevails, it would be the commission’s first defeat in a case concerning so-called abuse of dominance by a company for many years, said Trevor Soames, a competition lawyer in Brussels. “The line of success on the part of the commission will be stopped in its tracks. “One of the big problems in dominance cases over the last 10 years has been a lack of confidence that, on appeal in Luxembourg, there would be a substantive review” and “that basically you were almost inevitably going to lose a dominance appeal”, Mr Soames said. While urging a review of the case, Mr Wahl said the fact that the fine was record-breaking doesn’t necessarily mean it was inappropriate – provided it is eventually shown that Intel broke EU law. Impeded competition The EU’s eight-year investigation found that Intel impeded competition by giving rebates to computer makers from 2002-2005 on the condition that they buy at least 95 per cent of chips for PCs from Intel. The EU regulator said Intel imposed “restrictive conditions” for the remaining 5 per cent, supplied by Advanced Micro Devices, which struggled to overcome Intel’s hold on the market for processors that run PCs. Acer, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo and NEC were among computer firms coaxed to use Intel chips, the commission said in 2009. The EU ordered Intel to stop using illegal rebates to thwart competitors, an instruction that Intel complained was unclear. Qualcomm will be watching the Intel case as it battles EU allegations that it paid an unidentified phone manufacturer to use its chipset. It will defend itself next month at a closed-door hearing examining a second set of charges that it sold chips below-cost to harm a smaller rival. Added details Mr Wahl was critical of the EU’s handling of evidence it gathered against Intel, saying the lower court was wrong to rule that regulators could add details of a meeting with a Dell executive long after the fact. Any ruling on this point may echo challenges that Ireland and Apple are preparing against the process leading up to the EU’s tax decision in August. The appeals may argue that EU regulators unfairly kept them in the dark during the investigation and neglected to flag a shift in emphasis in the investigation, people with knowledge of their case have said. Advanced Micro Devices, which initiated the EU antitrust case, is no longer involved in the case and did not intervene in the EU court hearings. – (Bloomberg)       Topics: Damien Geradin Nils Wahl Trevor Soames Intel Read More Tourist industry urged to shift focus from UK to EU London Briefing: Carney takes chance to get own back on MPs Brexit casts shadow over Irish retailers in run-up to Christmas Mixed-use commercial building in Galway on sale for €1.3m Revamped mock Georgian offices on Leeson Street for rent Britvic’s Kilcarbery Business Park warehouse has price tag of over €15m Agent gets 17.5% above asking price using BidX1 technology Lynam’s Hotel bought by private investor for nearly €6m Ciarán Hancock: Buying Peacock will take Greencore to new level Easyjet may apply for Irish licence to ensure EU access Major Bray shopping and cinema complex to go ahead Ulster Bank HQ expected to attract UK financial institutions UK group secures €22m profit on Irish Nationwide's Dublin HQ Lundin sells Clare site to new mining company Unions to seek rises of 4% for workers in private sector companies Martin McGuinness says he was ‘in the dark’ over Project Eagle Snapchat has secretly filed for flotation, sources claim Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Transport & Tourism Easyjet may apply for Irish licence to ensure EU access Personal Finance The bond rout and Irish pension savers: what you need to be aware of International Gordon D’Arcy: All Blacks will be bitter, Ireland must be better Business Sensors help police curb gang violence in Cape Town Sponsored World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ Ten things to consider when buying a new sofa ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Hines emerges as top bidder for student residence beside UCD 06:45 Bank of Ireland ‘will utilise any relaxation of mortgage rules’ 06:34 €700 per sq m rent for top D2 offices 06:30 Tourist industry urged to shift focus from UK to EU 06:08 London Briefing: Carney takes chance to get own back on MPs 06:06 ADVERTISEMENT Tech Tools Could sleep problems be a thing of the past with Sense?

Global perspective. advertisement Europe court advisor issues opinion favoring Intel appeal against antitrust fine Thursday 20 October 2016 at 1:40 PM ET by Ashley Hogan ©  WikiMedia (M.O. Stevens) [JURIST] Advocate General Nils Wahl of the European Court of Justice [official website] issued an opinion [text, PDF] on Thursday in favor of Intel in the dispute over a €1.06 billion EU antitrust fine imposed for anti-competitive behavior. Wahl questioned whether the fine received for abuse of Intel's dominant position, namely in giving rebates to customers and certain deals made with Lenovo, had really harmed competition. While the opinion given by Wahl is not binding on the court, it is suggested that the General Court's decision to dismiss Intel's appeal in regards to the fine imposed by the European Commission should be set aside and the question referred back to the General Court to examine all the circumstances of the case to properly determine the actual or potential effect of Intel's conduct on competition within the EU internal market. The ECJ will consider the opinion and decide in the coming months. The European Commission, the executive of the EU, has taken action against many large companies operating in the European market. In August the European Commission ruled [JURIST report] that Ireland may recover up to €13 billion from Apple [corporate website] after the company benefited from undue tax breaks. The commission ruled the tax breaks were illegal based on EU law because the tax benefit meant that Apple paid less taxes to operate in the country than other businesses, resulting in an unfair economic advantage. In April the Commission opened a probe [JURIST report] into the international business practices of Google concerning the tech giant's relationship with other Android developers, questioning whether Google's practice of requiring mobile phone producers to pre-load Google applications on new devices could hinder innovation and might violate international antitrust law.

Intel's 7th generation Core CPUs for laptops were launched at the end of August, and we have already seen some products sporting these new efficient processors, but we have to wait until January 2017 for 7th gen desktop processors to become officially available. Tech site WCCF Tech took note of a pair of interesting reports from China where users are apparently testing out officially unreleased Intel Kaby Lake desktop chips. One source tried overclocking an Intel Core i7-7700 on LN2, another an Intel Core i5-7600K on air. Both used a 100-series motherboard with the latest Kaby Lake supporting BIOS. Intel Core i7-7700K HKEPC Hardware has had its hands on an Intel Core i7-7700K and decided to give it a test run to its limits using LN2 cooling. The system was based upon an ASRock Z170M OC Formula motherboard with GALAX HOF DDR4 memory installed. An x67 multiplier was used to achieve a clock speed of 6.7GHz. The bus speed wasn't tweaked and we don't have any details regarding voltages, unfortunately.   Intel Core i5-7600K A person/group by the name of FacebookHK has been twiddling with an Intel Core i5-7600K chip for at least a week now. Using an ASUS Maximus VIII Gene motherboard and air cooling it was possible to coax the Kaby Lake i5 to achieve 5.1GHz using just an air cooler. The chip ran at an x40 multiplier, the bus speed was tweaked to 127.51MHz, with the voltage set to 1.504V. This system was reported to be stable with good temperature readings, no core went above 46C when taxed. Last but not least, Expreview has had its hands on a 'retail' Core i5-7600K chip and reports that the substrate should not suffer from bending under cooler attachment pressure. Thankfully Kaby Lake's PCB and its heatsink package appear to be more robust than on Skylake chips.

October 20 AAPL: 117.06 -0.06 Report: iPhone 7 models w/ Qualcomm modem feature better cellular performance versus Intel Jeff Benjamin - 4 weeks ago @JeffBenjam iPhone 7 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit In this latest iPhone generation, Apple has brought to market two iPhone 7 variants: the GSM/WCDMA/LTE with Intel modem version, and the GSM/CDMA/WCDMA/TD-SCDMA/LTE version with Qualcomm hardware. A new report is highlighting the first performance differences between the iPhone 7 featuring Intel’s modem hardware compared to the iPhone 7 featuring Qualcomm modem hardware. The report from Cellular Insights finds that iPhone 7’s equipped with Qualcomm’s MDM9645M modem, which powers the (A1660, A1661) Verizon, Sprint, and SIM-free models, features better cellular performance than the (A1778, A1784) Intel version. Not only that, but the Qualcomm version’s ability to take advantage of Ultra HD Voice has been disabled as well according to the report. Ultra HD Voice The first interesting point gleaned from Cellular Insights’ report is that Qualcomm’s MDM9645M modem is capable of Ultra HD Voice, which is the marketing name for the Enhanced Voice Services codec, or EVS. EVS can result in significantly improved audio quality over cellular connections, but according to this report, Apple decided to disable this feature. It’s a decision that Cellular Insights claims may be an attempt to level the playing field with the Intel-powered version of the iPhone 7. As of now, only T-Mobile has deployed EVS on its network, so coverage is limited in the US. T-Mobile says that EVS brings several notable benefits to its customers, including the following: EVS improves voice call reliability in areas of weaker signal, which means the rare dropped call on LTE will happen even less frequently. EVS provides even higher-fidelity calls than the HD Voice. EVS does this with a broader audio frequency range, which translates to richer, more realistic-sounding voice audio. It’s ironic, because T-Mobile customers are being supplied with the iPhone 7 (Intel version), which isn’t capable of supporting this feature from a hardware perspective. It should be noted that at least two other T-Mobile-compatible phones, the LG G5 and the Samsung Galaxy S7, support EVS. If you’re not on T-Mobile, then this isn’t a big deal, as no other carriers appear to support Ultra HD Voice at the moment. That could change in the future, however, and since the AT&T and T-Mobile versions aren’t capable of supporting the feature from a hardware perspective, we probably won’t see support for EVS until future iPhone models are released. But the EVS/Ultra HD Voice details aren’t the only interesting data points to trickle in from this report. The information contains RF tests that pit the Qualcomm version of the iPhone 7 Plus vs the Intel version. Cellular Insights says that it procured the iPhone 7 Plus units and all test hardware from Rohde & Schwarz using its own funding for independent analysis. Cellular performance The report begins by measuring the LTE throughput for both devices in order to compare data between the Intel-powered and Qualcomm-powered iPhone 7 Plus models. The findings are quite interesting. Both versions of the iPhone 7 Plus were able to achieved maximum sustained data throughput while at cell center, but when reducing power levels to simulate edge of cell scenarios, each phone responded differently. For example, in the graph above, you can see how Band 12 (10MHz) performance differs between the two basebands during a controlled environment test. Notice how the throughput drops drastically on the XMM7360 (Intel) version as power levels are reduced. Band 12, which is a low frequency band, can propagate further, and penetrate walls better than high frequency bands. In other words, it’s a band that is frequently needed when using LTE inside of buildings. Note the significant difference in throughput around -108 dBm. Cellular Insights tested two additional LTE bands as well: Band 4 (20MHz), and Band 7 (20MHz) in 4×2 MIMO. The results, as you can see, follow the same trend. Be sure to check out Cellular Insight’s test page for the full explainer. There you’ll find details on testing methods used, hardware used, etc. You can also find its results and corresponding graph when testing Band 7, and see how the iPhone 7’s modem performance stacks up to other devices, like the Galaxy S7 and the LG G5. It’s an enlightening read on a technical level that’s well worth the time. Conclusion After testing, the conclusion is that the iPhone 7 hardware with the Qualcomm-powered modem has a significant cellular modem performance edge over the Intel variant. As to why Apple has sourced two baseband suppliers after years of using Qualcomm hardware exclusively, it likely has much to do with broadening its supply chain. In this case, however, it looks like supply chain diversification has resulted in a measurable performance difference between the two models in a lab-controlled environment. Of course, controlled tests differ from real world usage and scenarios, but these findings are nonetheless interesting. I tend not to read too much into this data, because Apple has no-doubt tested both models, and found that each performed satisfactorily in real world usage. Also worth noting is that the iPhone 7 with the Qualcomm modem is only being sold in China, Japan and in the United States, which means that Apple deemed the Intel version to be good enough for every other territory. That said, if you’re buying an iPhone 7 for full price in one of the aforementioned territories, then I highly recommend going with the Verizon/Sprint/SIM-free version. Not only does this version seem to perform better from a cellular modem perspective, but it’s also capable of working with most cellular carriers in the US and abroad.

Intel Haswell OpenGL & Vulkan Testing With Mesa Git Written by Michael Larabel in Display Drivers on 20 October 2016. Page 1 of 3. 13 Comments It's been a while since last running any major Linux graphics tests with Intel Haswell era hardware, but in preparing for a big Linux 3.x/4.x kernel comparison with a Core i7 Haswell, I ran some fresh graphics benchmarks with OpenGL and Vulkan. The system used for testing is an Intel Core i7 4790K Devil's Canyon rig with HD Graphics 4600. The system had a clean install of Ubuntu 16.10 x86_64 where i ran some out-of-the-box tests followed by tests of Mesa Git (12.1-dev this week, now 13.0 Git) and then a third run with the Mesa Git Padoka PPA stack paired with the Linux 4.9 Git kernel. Thus it's a very fresh look at the Vulkan and OpenGL experience with Haswell. With the upcoming Mesa 13.0 release (and on Mesa Git master), OpenGL 3.3 is still the latest version exposed... Floating around for a while has been the FP64 patches for Haswell Mesa to enable OpenGL 4.0 with this generation of Intel GPUs, but they have yet to be merged and thus will not be found in next month's Mesa 13.0 stable release. So sadly Haswell is still at GL 3.3 for now but hopefully it won't be too much longer before it sees FP64 for GL 4.0. Broadwell and newer graphics hardware has OpenGL 4.5 with the upcoming Mesa 13.0. Also tested was Dota 2 with Vulkan. The Intel "ANV" Vulkan driver does work for Haswell GPUs. The Intel ANV driver exposes Vulkan 1.0 with Haswell. I believe this is my first time testing Vulkan with Haswell compared to my extensive Broadwell and Skylake testing. While Haswell is much slower, Dota 2 was running and it appeared to render the game correctly. Other Phoronix readers though have reported Haswell Vulkan Linux issues previously with this combination not being as well vetted by the open-source drivers as with the newer and more powerful hardware. During the testing of this latest code, I did encounter what appeared to be some messed up damage tracking when using Firefox on this system. Well, on the following pages are some results of this i7-4790K Haswell system with OpenGL and Vulkan on Mesa Git and Linux 4.9. All tests done by the Phoronix Test Suite.

Completely redesigned from ground up, the system is made specifically for enthusiasts and power users who want desktop performance but don't want to sacrifice portability. Packed with more power than ever before possible in a notebook under an inch thick, Razer's latest system is capable of handling virtually any task, anytime, anywhere.     The new Razer Blade Pro debuts as the thinnest and lightest desktop replacement in the world with a 17.3-inch G-Sync IGZO display, Intel's latest quad-core i7 CPU, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 GPU, up to 2 TB of SSD storage and an ultra-low profile mechanical keyboard   The new Razer Blade Pro features the latest Intel Core i7 quad-core processor and next-generation NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 GPU. It is the most powerful system ever built by Razer and the thinnest notebook available with a GTX 1080. Other highlights on the new Razer Blade Pro include Thunderbolt 3 for advanced connectivity options, 32 GB of DDR4 dual-channel memory, up to 2 TB of PCI M.2 SSD in RAID 0 storage and a built-in SD card reader.   While other similarly equipped desktop replacements are more than two inches thick and weigh more than 10 pounds, the new Blade Pro retains its iconic form factor. Its unibody CNC aluminum chassis still measures just 0.88 inches thin while weighing less than eight pounds. The included AC adapter also dwarfs similarly powered systems and complements the overall mobility of the Blade Pro.     Even more remarkable is the system's thermal management system. This all new thermal management system in the Blade Pro now includes the worlds thinnest manufactured vapor chamber cooling solution in a notebook. The vapor chamber reduces heat resistance and hotspots by spreading heat quickly, evenly and efficiently. A custom fan design and dynamic heat exchanger are paired with the vapor chamber to maximize heat dissipation. This allows the Razer Blade Pro to be the most powerful computer ever assembled in such a thin chassis.   The rest of the desktop replacement notebook offers a similar no-compromises approach. A stunning 17.3-inch 4K IGZO monitor with NVIDIA G-SYNC technology produces the smoothest possible framerates. The display offers 100 percent Adobe RGB color accuracy to deliver stunning visuals to gamers and professionals.   Additionally, the Razer Blade Pro is the first notebook to utilize Razer's Ultra-Low-Profile Mechanical switches. Each switch features a true actuation and reset point. Presses are registered with 65 grams of force, mimicking the feel of full-size mechanical keyboards. The keyboard and trackpad are also Powered by Razer Chroma. This technology unlocks a virtually endless array of dazzling lighting effects that can be customized by the user or synced to display in-game events.   The specs for the Blade Pro exceed minimum hardware requirements of HTC Vive , Oculus Rift and OSVR HDK 2, making it one of the most mobile VR-ready devices for enthusiasts and developers.     "The original 17-inch Blade was the first laptop that truly blended power and portability in a PC," says Min-Liang Tan, Razer co-founder and CEO. "We've taken that approach another step further with the new Razer Blade Pro. The thermal engineering behind it is staggering. It's incredible how far we've come, from having one product and a small team, to today, with a full catalog of gaming systems and a large group of engineers and designers pushing what a portable gaming machine can do."   "It's impressive what Razer was able to pack into the new Razer Blade Pro," said Mark Aevermann, senior product lead for GeForce gaming laptops at NVIDIA. "They have managed to design a gaming laptop with our flagship GeForce GTX 1080, in a form factor gamers can take with them on the road."   The 17-inch Blade Pro joins the rest of Razer's award-winning systems lineup. The 14-inch Razer Blade sets the benchmark for mobile gaming, while the 12.5-inch Razer Blade Stealth was named the "Best PC" at CES earlier this year for its combination of performance, value, expandability and portability. Both models recently announced refreshes that are shipping now.   For more information on the new Razer Blade Pro, and to register to be notified about on-sale timing, visit razerzone.com/bladepro.

Razer Blade vs Stealth vs Pro: Which gaming laptop is best? by Sean Keach 20 October 2016 0 shares Read Comments Razer Blade vs Stealth vs Pro: What's the difference? To the eternal disappointment of UK fans, Europe had always missed out on Razer’s hugely popular line of gaming notebooks. But that’s all changed, as Razer unleashes three new gaming laptops on the continent: Razer Blade Stealth, Razer Blade and Razer Blade Pro. What’s the difference, and which one should you buy? Related: Best gaming laptop Razer Blade The Razer Blade is the mid-tier option out of Razer’s new laptop trio. It’s a gaming laptop that's been designed to be as portable as possible, which explains why it’s lighter than a MacBook Pro, and only marginally thicker than a MacBook Air. What’s exciting about the Razer Blade is that, unlike the old model, it features a proper desktop GPU – specifically, Nvidia’s new GeForce GTX 1060. That means it’s VR-ready, and should be capable of playing most games at Full HD resolution. Note also that this is the full-fat 6GB GDDR5 VRAM version of the GTX 1060, rather than the cheaper 3GB variant, which is good news. Unlike the other two Razer laptops, the new Blade is using an older 6th-generation Intel processor. You’ll also get a choice between 256GB, 512GB and 1TB storage options, and either a Full HD or QHD+ 14-inch display. The Razer Blade is attractively designed, a sports a thin, black aluminium chassis that won’t look massively out of place in a home or work environment. It’s the ideal choice for people who need computing heft on the move. Here are the Razer Blade’s key specs: Screen: 14-inch IGZO QHD+ (3,200 x 1,800) multi-touch / IPS Full HD Matte (1,920 x 1,080) CPU: 6th-gen Intel Core i7-6700HQ (2.6GHz / 3.5GHz) GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 (6GB GDDR5 VRAM) Storage: 256GB / 512GB / 1TB PCIe SSD RAM: 16GB DDR4 (2,133MHz) Ports: Thunderbolt 3, USB-C, 3x USB 3.0, HDMI 2.0, 3.5mm Battery: 70Wh Size: 17.9mm x 345mm x 235mm Weight: 1.89kg (Full HD) / 1.95kg (QHD+) You can pre-order the Razer Blade now at Razer’s online store in the UK, US, Germany and France, with shipping expected to begin “within a couple of weeks”. It costs £1,749, $1,799 or €1,999, and comes with a free Razer Mamba Tournament Edition gaming mouse and Razer Mercenary backpack. Razer Blade Stealth The Razer Blade Stealth is the cheapest option, and is arguably just a plain, old ultrabook, rather than a gaming notebook. It’s thinner and lighter than a 13-inch MacBook Air, and features a new 7th-generation Intel Core i7 processor. It also packs an impressive 16GB of RAM, but misses out on dedicated graphics. You’ll have to settle for integrated Intel HD Graphics 620, which rules out any high-performance gaming. But don’t fret, because Razer has a workaround in the shape of the Razer Core. The Core is a dedicated external graphics enclosure that sits on your desk, and connects to your laptop via Thunderbolt 3. It’s fully compatible with the latest Nvidia and AMD graphics cards, including the top-end GeForce GTX 1080 GPU. The Stealth will cost you £999, while the Core will set you back a further £399, which means that both of them together still cost less than a Razer Blade. And importantly, there’s the potential to have the Stealth running on a GPU that’s even more powerful than the Blade’s built-in GTX 1060. Of course, you'll have to actually pay for a GPU to stick in the Core, so you'll need to factor that cost in. That said, when you’re on the go, you’ll have to settle for slightly less processing power. But if you use your laptop for basic tasks on the move, and only really play video games at home, the Blade Stealth is a seriously impressive alternative – especially considering the 4K display option. Here are the Razer Blade Stealth’s key specs: Screen: 12.5-inch IGZO multi-touch – QHD (2,560 x 1,440) / UHD (3,840 x 2,160) CPU: 7th-gen Intel Core i7-7500U (2.7GHz / 3.5GHz) GPU: Intel HD Graphics 620 (integrated) Storage: 128GB / 256GB / 512GB / 1TB PCIe SSD RAM: 16GB LPDDR3 (1,866MHz) Ports: Thunderbolt 3, USB-C, 2x USB 3.0, HDMI 2.0a, 3.5mm Battery: 53.6Wh Size: 13.1mm x 321mm x 206mm Weight: 1.29kg You can buy the Razer Blade Stealth in the UK, US, Germany and France for £999, $999 or €1,099. It also comes with a free copy of the FL Studio photo editing software, worth €189. And if you buy one before the end of October, you’ll get a Razer Orochi gaming mouse and a Razer Kabuto mousepad for free. Meanwhile, the Razer Core external graphics enclosure costs £499 or €599. But if you buy it at the same time as you purchase a Razer Blade Stealth, the price is reduced to £399 or €449. Razer Blade Pro The Razer Blade Pro is the crème de la crème of Razer’s gaming notebook trio. It’s envisioned as a true desktop replacement, and the spec sheet makes it clear why. First off, you’re getting Nvidia’s flagship desktop graphics card built-in – that’s the GeForce GTX 1080, with 8GB of GDDR5X VRAM. That sits alongside Intel’s 6th-gen Core i7-6700HQ, which has a mighty peak clock speed of 3.5GHz. That's still a laptop processor, mind, but it'll beat some desktop chips all the same. The multi-touch display spans 17.3-inches, and features a 3,840 x 2,160 pixel resolution. Better still, it’s got Nvidia’s anti-screen tearing G-Sync technology built-in. You can choose from three different PCIe SSD storage options (512GB / 1TB / 2TB), with all models shipping with 32GB of dual-channel 2,133MHz DDR4 RAM. Perhaps one of the standout features is the low-profile mechanical keyboard, which is unique among gaming laptops. Despite looking like a traditional chiclet keyboard, all keys feature mechanical switches and individual backlighting, which means that the laptop is also fully Chroma-enabled. The Razer Blade Pro is comfortably the biggest laptop of the trio, with a height of 22.5mm and a weight of 3.54kg. But it’s only a few millimetres thicker than a MacBook Pro, and features seriously impressive hardware that will rival (and likely beat) many advanced desktop PC configurations. If you’re not keen on having a giant desktop PC in your home, the Razer Blade Pro is seriously worth considering. Add in the fact that, despite being heavy, it’s still technically portable – moreso than a desktop PC, anyway – then the value is clear. But it’s a tough sell to most gamers thanks to its staggeringly high price tag. Here are the Razer Blade Pro’s key specs: Screen: 17.3-inch IGZO UHD (3,840 x 2,160) multi-touch (with Nvidia G-Sync) CPU: 7th-gen Intel Core i7-6700HQ (2.6GHz / 3.5GHz) GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 (8GB GDDR5X VRAM) Storage: 512GB / 1TB / 2TB PCIe SSD RAM: 32GB dual-channel DDR4 (2,133MHz) Ports: Thunderbolt 3, USB-C, 3x USB 3.0, HDMI 2.0, 3.5mm, SDXC card reader Battery: 99Wh Size: 22.5mm x 424mm x 281mm Weight: 3.54kg You can buy the Razer Blade Pro in the UK, US, Germany, and France for £3,499, $3,699 or €4,199. Which Razer Blade laptop should I buy? Here, we have three laptops designed for three very different kinds of gamer, and you’ll find good and bad points about each. If performance is the only metric you measure a laptop’s worth by, then the Razer Blade Pro (£3,499) is the obvious choice. It’s absolutely a ‘money is no object’ purchase; many gamers wouldn’t dream of dropping nearly four grand on a laptop. But if you’re done with desk-hogging PCs and you’re flush with cash, then the Razer Blade Pro is hard not to recommend. That said, it’s very bulky, so if you want to use this laptop on the move, consider an alternative Blade. The Razer Blade is far more portable that the Blade Pro, but it’s significantly less powerful. If you can deal with toning down the graphics settings or resolution on more demanding games, this is a great choice. Better still, you can use this laptop for video editing, and just about any other work too. But at £1,749, it’s hardly cheap, so you have to consider whether a Stealth would suit your needs better. Razer's Blade Stealth laptop could be perfect for at-home gamers in need of an ultrabook The Razer Blade Stealth is the thinnest and lightest of the bunch, and will hardly be noticeable when lugged around in a backpack. And at £999, it’s really competitively priced. But the trade-off is that you won’t be able to game seriously unless you’re connected up to the Razer Core graphics enclosure. Still, there’s potentially good value to be had. A Razer Blade Stealth £999 paired with a £399 Razer Core, plus an Nvidia GTX 1080 (~£670), will cost you £2,068. That’s pricier than the Blade, but it’ll get you a GTX 1080 rig for far less than a Blade Pro would cost. Of course, you’ll still have to settle for a smaller screen, less RAM and a weaker processor, but it’s ideal for the at-home gamer looking for an ultrabook. Only you know whether any of the new Razer Blade laptops will suit your needs, but there’s no denying that all three are impressive products, and are all definitely worth your consideration.

And, could you point me to the buy stealth + core offer ? The core only has a "notify me" option right now. Sean Keach October 21, 2016, 9:51 am Hi Crazyjc, thanks for commenting! There are Blade and Blade Stealth models that were released earlier in 2016 that use 6th generation models. But according to the press release and briefing, the new Stealth and new Pro use 7th gen, while Blade uses 6th gen. However, I'll contact the Razer PR team now to clarify this and make sure the info is correct! crazyjc October 21, 2016, 10:11 am Awesome! Thanks Sean ! Super excited these are finally here, and was wondering why the latest models aren't. James Adina October 30, 2016, 5:08 am Are you on the American site? I am in Australia and the 7th gen processor razer blade stealth aswell as the core (has 'notify me') aren't available here but they are in America. Jason Dimopoulos November 7, 2016, 2:56 pm The website says the the Blade is compatible with the Core as well. Would there be much benefit from using the core with a blade seeing as the blade has an almost full spec graphics card already? Or would they actually work together to make a monster of a graphics handling system? FYI, I'm interested for 4k video editing rather then pure gaming.

The A1778 and A1784 iPhone models use a GSM-only Intel XMM7360 modem while the A1660 and 1661 iPhone models use a GSM/CDMA-compatible Qualcomm MDM9645M modem. Apple's decision has already caused some disappointment among customers because the GSM-only Intel modem is not compatible with as many carrier networks as the GSM/CDMA Qualcomm modem, and now independent testing conducted by Cellular Insights suggests there are some significant performance differences between the two modems, with the Qualcomm modem outperforming the Intel modem. Using an R&S TS7124 RF Shielded Box, two R&S CMW500, one R&S CMWC controller, and four Vivaldi antennas, Cellular Insights created a setup to simulate LTE performance at different distances from a cellular tower using two iPhone 7 Plus devices, one with an Intel modem and one with a Qualcomm modem. The goal of the test was to measure the highest achievable LTE throughput starting at a Reference Signal Received Quality of -85dBm (a strong signal) and gradually reducing the power level to simulate moving away from a cellular tower where signal is weaker. Three LTE bands were tested: Band 12, Band 4 (the most common band in North America), and Band 7. In all three tests, both the iPhone 7 Plus models offered similar performance in ideal conditions, but as power levels decreased, Cellular Insights saw "unexplainable sharp dips in performance" in the Intel modem, finding a gap "north of 30%" in favor of the Qualcomm iPhone 7 Plus. In the charts, the Qualcomm modem maintains noticeably higher throughput speeds than the Intel modem as signal strength decreases. In real world conditions, this would suggest the Qualcomm modem does better in areas where the cellular connection is weak, with faster throughput speeds. Cellular Insights describes the Band 12 test below: Both iPhone 7 Plus variants perform similarly in ideal conditions. At -96dBm the Intel variant needed to have Transport Block Size adjusted as BLER well exceeded the 2% threshold. At -105dBm the gap widened to 20%, and at -108dBm to a whopping 75%. As a result of such a huge performance delta between the Intel and Qualcomm powered devices, we purchased another A1784 (AT&T) iPhone 7 Plus, in order to eliminate any possibility of a faulty device. The end result was virtually identical. [...] At -121dBm, the Intel variant performed more in line with its Qualcomm counterpart. Overall, the average performance delta between the two is in the 30% range in favor of the QualcommCellular Insights also created a chart that compares the edge of cell performance of several different smartphones. The increasing numbers on the X-axis below represent increasingly poor signal strength, while on the Y-axis, a higher throughput number indicates better performance. The iPhone 7 Plus with an Intel modem demonstrates the poorest performance of all phones tested. According to Cellular Insights, in every single test, the iPhone 7 Plus with a Qualcomm modem "had a significant performance edge" over the iPhone 7 Plus with an Intel modem.

First, it is severely constrained when traveling abroad. And now, even when at home, it is inferior to the same price Qualcomm version. Shame on you Apple. Give a partial refund to customers with an Intel modem. You sell two products at the same price, one is clearly inferior to the other, but you don't tell customers. You should charge less for the Intel version.

(Photo: Intel) Even with good grades, after high school graduation, Maria Reyes did not think of herself as a future engineer. Thankfully, a college recruiter helped her understand otherwise. “I was good in math and science, but I didn’t even have any idea what an engineer was,” she recalled. Reyes did go on to become a civil engineer and earned both bachelor’s and master’s degrees in the field. Today, she is the dean of Industry and public service for Phoenix College. In that role, she is afforded the opportunity to shape the minds and careers of today’s Latinas, a sub-group that makes up only about 2 percent of the scientists and engineers in the country, according to the National Science Foundation. Although STEM degrees for both Latinos and Latinas are rising, there is still plenty of room for improvement. So, rather than have future Latinas second guess their career paths as she did, Reyes wants them to know that a STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Math) career is certainly possible - if they’re willing to make the commitment. Programming Latinas for success More than 12 years ago, Reyes partnered with Intel Corp. to create Hermanas, a program where valley high school and middle school Latinas attend a day-long seminar at a select Maricopa Community College location. "The Hermanas conference has been so successful that the model has been replicated at other Intel sites including Oregon and Guadalajara,” said Intel’s Director of Public Affairs, Carlos Contreras. The events have three critical components: A hands-on STEM activity conducted by a community college faculty member; a Latina Town Hall where Latina STEM professionals share their stories and answer questions, and an educational resource fair that allows attendees to receive STEM-tailored advising for high school and beyond. “The conferences are designed to expose them to role models, first and foremost. … We also want girls to envision themselves as scientists or working in technology.” Reyes added. “We are targeting young women who may not have ever thought about these careers.” There are six events per year. Fall gatherings target middle schoolers while spring events seek high school Latinas. The program has served more than 4,000 attendees since inception. The effort, now in its 12th year, received Intel seed funding early on and now sees financial support from the Intel Involved Matching Grants program, which allocates $10 for every volunteer hour the company logs to the nonprofit. Events have been held at Phoenix College, Estrella Mountain Community College, South Mountain and Chandler-Gilbert Community College and several other campuses. Hermanas partners with valley school districts whose counselors evaluate students they feel would benefit from the event. Hermanas also taps Intel’s Latino Employee Network and Latina Working Group for speakers and mentors. “This is a true public-private partnership,” Reyes noted. “We draw on Latina role models in STEM from anywhere we can.” And-or Maria Harper-Marinick, chancellor of the Maricopa Community Colleges District, frequently speaks at Hermanas events. Harper-Marinick, who arrived in Arizona in the 1980s as a Fulbright Scholar and then launched her career in education in the Grand Canyon State, always attempts to connect with young Latinas by seeing them as her own children. “I speak to them, in many cases, as I would my daughter. Part of what I tell them is that you don’t need to choose between being an engineer or a mother. These aren’t ‘or’ choices. We have ‘and’ choices,” she said. “We have not been told that that’s a choice. Some of it is cultural; some is myth that it’s too hard for us to be both. … Then, for reasons I don’t know, many (Latinas) think ‘I’m not good at math.’ … Part of what we’re trying to say is that maybe you’re better than you think.” Harper-Marinick appreciates Hermanas’ attempts at, first and foremost, making the science activities during each program fun. Then, during the second half of the day, she sees the advising opportunities as critical. They allow Latinas interested in STEM careers to tailor high school classes in a way that would be beneficial for attending college without then needing to take too many remedial courses. “Some of them want it, but they may not take the right courses in high school,” she added. “It’s so important to help them understand that piece.” For more information about how to engage with Hermanas visit: www.cgc.edu/hermanas.

In May 2009 the European Commission imposed a fine of EUR 1.06 billion on the US-based microchip manufacturer for abusing its dominant position on the market for x86 CPUs (central processing units), in infringement of EU antitrust rules. In addition, the EU executive ordered Intel immediately to bring an end to that infringement in so far as it had not done so already. Intel, it said, had abused its dominant position on the worldwide market for x86 CPUs from October 2002 to December 2007, by implementing a strategy aimed at foreclosing a competitor, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), from the market. As Intel held a market share of roughly 70 per cent or more, it was extremely difficult for competitors to enter the market, said the Commission, and to expand as a result of the unrecoverable nature of investments to be made in research and development, intellectual property and production facilities. According to the Commission, the abuse was characterised by several measures adopted by Intel vis-a-vis its own customers (computer manufacturers) and the European retailer of microelectronic devices, Media-Saturn-Holding. Accordingly, Intel granted rebates to four major computer manufacturers (Dell, Lenovo, HP and NEC) on the condition that they purchased from Intel all, or almost all, of their x86 CPUs. Similarly, Intel awarded payments to Media-Saturn, which were conditioned on the latter selling exclusively computers containing Intel's x86 CPUs. According to the Commission, those rebates and payments induced the loyalty of the four manufacturers listed above and of Media-Saturn, and thus significantly diminished the ability of Intel?s competitors to compete on the merits of their x86 CPUs. Intel's anti-competitive conduct thereby resulted in a reduction of consumer choice and in lower incentives to innovate. On the basis of the 2006 Guidelines, the Commission imposed a fine on Intel of EUR 1.06 billion. Intel brought an action against the Commission's decision before the General Court, seeking the annulment of that decision or, at least, a substantial reduction of the fine. The EU's General Court had dismissed Intel's action in its entirety in 2014. But Intel appealed on several points, including the nature of 'exclusivity rebates', the assessment of market coverage, the interpretation of EU law and the amount of the fine. Advocate General Nils Wahl notes in today's opinion that the General Court found that the rebates granted to Dell, HP, NEC and Lenovo are 'exclusivity rebates' and, because of this classification, did not consider it necessary to consider the capability of such a rebate to restrict competition. The Advocate General concluded that the General Court erred in finding that 'exclusivity rebates' constitute a separate and unique category of rebates that require no consideration of all the circumstances in order to establish an abuse of dominant position. In addition, he determined that the General Court erred in law in its alternative assessment of capability by failing to establish, on the basis of all the circumstances, that the rebates and payments offered by the appellant had, in all likelihood, an anti-competitive foreclosure effect. The Advocate General also upheld the second ground of appeal,concluding that Intel's market share was inconclusive for the purposes of establishing a restriction of competition. The Advocate General reiterated his view that no separate category of 'exclusivity rebates' existed, on the basis that 'exclusivity rebates' would be conditional upon the customer purchasing ?all or most? of its requirements from the dominant undertaking, which is not satisfied in the circumstances of this case. HP and Lenovo could still purchase significant quantities of 86 CPUs from AMD. He also concluded that EU legislation requires the Commission to record interviews to ensure that undertakings suspected of infringing EU competition rules can organise their defence, and that the EU courts can review whether the Commission exercised its powers within the law. Consequently, in his view, the General Court erred in law in holding that the Commission was not in breach of EU law by failing to organise and record a meeting as required under the applicable rules. In fact, the Advocate General does not agree that such a procedural irregularity could be remedied by the later note to file provided by the Commission since that note does not record the substance of the interview that the Commission had with the Dell executive. The Advocate General therefore considers that the fourth ground of appeal must also be upheld. Regarding the fine imposed, the Advocate General considers that the fact that the fine imposed was record-breaking at the time does not in itself make it disproportionate and Intel has failed to point to any legal error committed by the General Court which would permit the Court to assess the proportionality of the fine. As regards the retroactive application of the Commission?s 2006 fining guidelines to conduct that partially predated them, the Advocate General considers that it is EU legislation which defines the limits of the Commission?s discretion in imposing a fine for the infringement of EU competition rules, not the fining guidelines. Provided that the fine imposed remains within the limits of that legislation, Intel cannot rely on the principle of non-retroactivity to contest the fine imposed. So the judgment of the General Court should be set aside, said the Advocate General, and the case referred back for the General Court. While the Advocate General's Opinion is not binding on the Court of Justice, it is rarely overturned.

ASLR (address space layout randomization) is widely used as a defense against attempts by hackers to exploit software vulnerabilities to take control of computers. By randomising the locations of kernel and application components in memory, ASLR limits the ability for evil code, injected into a system, to reliably exploit programming flaws and hijack the attacked application or operating system. Hackers need to know where key components lie in memory in order to successfully exploit a bug, a process that ASLR frustrates. For example, take a booby-trapped PNG file that exploits a bug in an image editor. The software opens the PNG and is tricked into handing control of the processor to code smuggled within the picture – but the exploit code is now running blind. It cannot assume the location of key components that are needed to pivot from basic exploitation to a full compromise of the application and, next, the whole system. ASLR has juggled the libraries and other dependencies around at random, so an algorithm is needed to work out where things have been hidden. The Intel chip flaw can be abused by hackers to bypass this protection, thus ensuring their attacks are much more effective. In order to pull off this technique, miscreants must be able to at least start running their malicious code within an application or operating system on the target machine. The hack takes advantage of the CPU's branch target buffer, a mechanism present in many microprocessor architectures including Intel Haswell CPUs. Exploiting the buffer was demonstrated by the researchers on a Haswell-powered PC running Linux, and this attack is potentially effective against other platforms. The BTB provides a history of branches taken by the processor as it runs through its code: after the CPU is told to make a decision, it usually jumps to another part of the program based on the outcome of that decision. For example, if something fetched from memory has a value greater than zero, then jump to location A or jump to location B if not. If a jump location is in the history buffer then the CPU knows this branch is usually taken so can start priming itself with instructions from the jump landing point. That means branches routinely taken execute with minimal delay. By flooding the BTB with a range of branch targets, hackers can observe the BTB refilling with values of regularly taken jumps. This allows the miscreants to work out where in memory the operating system has randomly placed the application's vital components. It takes a few tens of milliseconds to perform, we're told. The eggheads say this allows an “attacker to identify the locations of known branch instructions in the address space of the victim process or kernel.” Their research, Jump Over ASLR: Attacking Branch Predictors to Bypass ASLR, by boffins at State University of New York at Binghamton and the University of California, Riverside, can be found here [PDF]. Alfredo Pironti, senior security consultant at IOActive, said the vulnerability shows that the security of physical IT (including chips) needs to be considered alongside more commonplace and less esoteric software flaws. “Software isn’t always the easiest point of entry, particularly for those hackers that have a deeper knowledge of hardware and its vulnerabilities,” said Pironti, who added that the ASLR bypass attack is an example of a hardware side-channel attack, an already recognised class of assault. “These attacks are often more expensive and time consuming to conduct, compared to classical software attacks,” Pironti explained. “Usually they also have stricter conditions, such as running a specific software on the victim’s machine and being able to collect CPU metrics. However, this doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t be vigilant. Cybercriminals are more sophisticated, well-funded and – worst of all – patient than ever before, and are always looking for new and surprising ways to infiltrate. “This is why it is vital that companies have their chips pen-tested during the development stage, as the cost and complexity of re-mediating an attack of this kind is enormous,” Pironti concluded. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 11 Comments More from The Register Boffins turn phone into tracker by abusing pairing with – that's right – IoT kit Black Hat EU Security researchers exploit vulns in Belkin home automation product 11 Comments Yeah, that '50bn IoT devices by 2020' claim is a load of dog toffee IDTechX report takes a swipe at other analysts' 'hype bubble' 28 Comments Dell bundles bundle of systems-bundlers into its IoT van Secure or not, it's great if someone's making money Google knifes Eclipse Android Developer Tools Android Studio 2.2 beckons, because what choice is there? 15 Comments Building IoT London: Still working on your pitch?

X Intel wins support in battle to overturn EU antitrust fine European court’s final decision could affect Apple fight over €13bn Irish tax bill Thu, Oct 20, 2016, 17:22 Intel, based in Santa Clara, California. The technology giant has been fighting to overturn a €1.06bn EU antitrust fine. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg         Intel’s fight to overturn a record €1.06 billion European Union antitrust fine received a boost from an adviser to the bloc’s top court in a case that could have ramifications for a growing list of disputes involving US tech giants, from Google to Apple. Intel’s appeal should be totally re-examined by a lower court, which blundered by ruling against the company’s system of rebates for PC makers using its chips, advocate general Nils Wahl of the European Court of Justice said in a nonbinding opinion on Thursday. The top court will decide whether to back his views in a ruling expected within six months. “If the court follows, this could be the most important ruling of the past 25 years because it’s the complete destruction of the judgment of the General Court, but also of the European Commission’s position,” said Damien Geradin, a lawyer at Edge Legal in Brussels. The lower tribunal was wrong to single out “exclusivity rebates” paid to customers who bought most or all of their chips from Intel, he said. The General Court’s analysis failed to show that the rebates harmed competition. The commission in Brussels and Intel declined to comment. Spotlight on Apple A victory for Intel would throw the spotlight on EU antitrust regulators facing a court clash with Ireland and Apple over the fairness of an investigation that culminated in the iPhone maker facing a €13 billion tax bill. The Intel ruling may also affect the EU’s handling of investigations into Google and Qualcomm that could ultimately lead to fines. Hines emerges as top bidder for student residence beside UCD Bank of Ireland ‘will utilise any relaxation of mortgage rules’ €700 per sq m rent for top D2 offices Intel’s 2009 antitrust fine was the EU’s biggest, more than double the €497 million penalty against Microsoft in 2004. It represented about 4 per cent of Intel’s $37.6 billion in sales in 2008, below the maximum penalty of 10 per cent of yearly sales that regulators can impose. ADVERTISEMENT In light of “the errors committed” by the General Court, Mr Wahl said a final ruling by the top tribunal was not possible at this stage. “That is because a decision on the merits hinges upon the examination of all the circumstances of the case,” he said, and of “the actual or potential effect of Intel’s conduct on competition” in the EU. If Intel ultimately prevails, it would be the commission’s first defeat in a case concerning so-called abuse of dominance by a company for many years, said Trevor Soames, a competition lawyer in Brussels. “The line of success on the part of the commission will be stopped in its tracks. “One of the big problems in dominance cases over the last 10 years has been a lack of confidence that, on appeal in Luxembourg, there would be a substantive review” and “that basically you were almost inevitably going to lose a dominance appeal”, Mr Soames said. While urging a review of the case, Mr Wahl said the fact that the fine was record-breaking doesn’t necessarily mean it was inappropriate – provided it is eventually shown that Intel broke EU law. Impeded competition The EU’s eight-year investigation found that Intel impeded competition by giving rebates to computer makers from 2002-2005 on the condition that they buy at least 95 per cent of chips for PCs from Intel. The EU regulator said Intel imposed “restrictive conditions” for the remaining 5 per cent, supplied by Advanced Micro Devices, which struggled to overcome Intel’s hold on the market for processors that run PCs. Acer, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo and NEC were among computer firms coaxed to use Intel chips, the commission said in 2009. The EU ordered Intel to stop using illegal rebates to thwart competitors, an instruction that Intel complained was unclear. Qualcomm will be watching the Intel case as it battles EU allegations that it paid an unidentified phone manufacturer to use its chipset. It will defend itself next month at a closed-door hearing examining a second set of charges that it sold chips below-cost to harm a smaller rival. Added details Mr Wahl was critical of the EU’s handling of evidence it gathered against Intel, saying the lower court was wrong to rule that regulators could add details of a meeting with a Dell executive long after the fact. Any ruling on this point may echo challenges that Ireland and Apple are preparing against the process leading up to the EU’s tax decision in August. The appeals may argue that EU regulators unfairly kept them in the dark during the investigation and neglected to flag a shift in emphasis in the investigation, people with knowledge of their case have said. Advanced Micro Devices, which initiated the EU antitrust case, is no longer involved in the case and did not intervene in the EU court hearings. – (Bloomberg)       Topics: Damien Geradin Nils Wahl Trevor Soames Intel Read More Tourist industry urged to shift focus from UK to EU London Briefing: Carney takes chance to get own back on MPs Brexit casts shadow over Irish retailers in run-up to Christmas Mixed-use commercial building in Galway on sale for €1.3m Revamped mock Georgian offices on Leeson Street for rent Britvic’s Kilcarbery Business Park warehouse has price tag of over €15m Agent gets 17.5% above asking price using BidX1 technology Lynam’s Hotel bought by private investor for nearly €6m Ciarán Hancock: Buying Peacock will take Greencore to new level Easyjet may apply for Irish licence to ensure EU access Major Bray shopping and cinema complex to go ahead Ulster Bank HQ expected to attract UK financial institutions UK group secures €22m profit on Irish Nationwide's Dublin HQ Lundin sells Clare site to new mining company Unions to seek rises of 4% for workers in private sector companies Martin McGuinness says he was ‘in the dark’ over Project Eagle Snapchat has secretly filed for flotation, sources claim Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Transport & Tourism Easyjet may apply for Irish licence to ensure EU access Personal Finance The bond rout and Irish pension savers: what you need to be aware of International Gordon D’Arcy: All Blacks will be bitter, Ireland must be better Business Sensors help police curb gang violence in Cape Town Sponsored World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ Ten things to consider when buying a new sofa ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Hines emerges as top bidder for student residence beside UCD 06:45 Bank of Ireland ‘will utilise any relaxation of mortgage rules’ 06:34 €700 per sq m rent for top D2 offices 06:30 Tourist industry urged to shift focus from UK to EU 06:08 London Briefing: Carney takes chance to get own back on MPs 06:06 ADVERTISEMENT Tech Tools Could sleep problems be a thing of the past with Sense?

Back in 2009, the EC imposed a €1.06bn penalty - 4.15 per cent of Intel's turnover - following a multi-year legal battle but Chipzilla has since twice appealed for the decision to be quashed. An opinion offered by the Advocate General, Nils Wahl, has offered encouragement to Intel's legal eagles; Wahl said a ruling by the EU's General Court — which dismissed Intel's first appeal — was flawed and needed to be sent back to the General Court for review. Wahl's non-binding opinion stressed the dismissal of Intel's appeal was delivered on iffy legal ground, and that the EU's General Court should have another look at the decision because it had overstated the degree to which Intel's rebates to OEMs had distorted the market. Additionally, Wahl noted that Intel's actual agreements with HP and Lenovo – two of the OEMs which Intel had awarded the conditional rebated (Dell and NEC were the others) – did not prevent those companies from purchasing plentiful amounts of x86 processors from rival manufacturers such as AMD, which brought the initial complaint. He added that Intel's market share was contracting towards the end of the ten year period that the General Court looked at, and that in 2007 it simply did not have enough market share for its activities to lessen competition. Wahl's opinion comes ahead of a European High court judgment, expected early next year, to whom the case has been escalated as Intel continues to fight the claim that in awarding conditional rebates to companies based on those companies purchasing the majority of their x86 CPUs from Intel, they were unfairly damaging competitiveness. For the 10 years ending 2007, Intel held 70 per cent of the global market share in x86 CPUs, according to the original ruling against Intel, which didn't bother to answer whether it was necessary to distinguish three separate x86 CPU markets in desktop PCs, notebooks and servers. Intel's conflict with AMD - the only other major x86 manufacturer - is longstanding, with Intel accused of suppressing access to its rival's chips in the first complaint AMD filed to the EU in 2000. It wasn't until May 2004 that the European Commission began to investigate these issues, and in 2009 found that Intel had indeed "implemented a strategy aimed at foreclosing a competitor, AMD, from the market for x86 CPU microprocessors." In his background to the proceedings, Wahl noted how prior to the turn of the millennium "there were several manufacturers of x86 CPUs. However, most of these manufacturers have since exited the market. According to the decision at issue, Intel and AMD are essentially the only two companies still manufacturing x86 CPUs." Intel scored an own goal is supporting OEMs to integrate its chips - some would say this directly accelerated the collapse of the local PC builder community, with the likes of Elonex, Evesham, Tiny and Time going bust as they were unable to compete with the might of the multi-nationals. In 2009, the European Commission found that in its rebates offered to the four aforementioned businesses, Intel had "induced the loyalty of the key OEMs" which "significantly [diminished] competitors’ ability to compete on the merits of their x86 CPUs. As a consequence, Intel’s anti-competitive conduct resulted in a reduction of consumer choice and in lower incentives to innovate" and it subsequently fined Intel €1.6bn.

Maintaining cover: A guide to business insurance Let's have a meeting in the echo chamber Download Current Issue If you cast your mind back to 2009 one of the memorable headlines from that year concerned the EC handing Intel a €1.06bn fine for abusing market dominance. The fine was accompanied by an order from the EC that Intel had to stop giving illegal rebates to PC manufacturers and other practices that were designed to underline its arch rival AMD. Apart from Intel, its lawyers and those in the EC involved in the case the majority of people might have forgotten about the case, but it has come to the fore again with reports that an EU court adviser has backed the chip maker’s appeal against the fine. The fine, which remains the largest ever given to a single company by the EU for antitrust infringement, is naturally something that Intel has been fighting to have reduced. According to Reuters, the firm has some sympathy from Advocate General Nils Wahl at the Court of Justice of the European Union. Whale is quoted as saying that Intel’s appeal should be upheld, which gives a fresh twist to a seven year old saga. The case came to life in 2009, when Intel was found to have abused its dominant position in the chip market for five years, from late 2002 to the end of 2007 and to have used its market leading position to muscle out AMD. At the time resellers have evidence as part of the investigation and various companies claimed that the anti-competitive behaviour contributed to them going out of business. The case first came to light when AMD filed a complaint in 2000 that alleged that manufacturers had been paid not to use its chips. Up until the Intel fine the highest penalty handed out by the EC was to Microsoft for €474m in 2004 for abusing its dominant market position.​ MicroScope+ Content Find more MicroScope+ content and other member only offers, here.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 20, 2016 at 9:25AM Chris Walker, Intel vice president for its client computing group and general manager of notebook product marketing. Image source: Intel.  After market close on Oct. 18, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) reported its financial results for the third quarter of the year. One part of this generally strong report that stood out was the fact that the company's operating profit in its client computing group, or CCG for short, jumped substantially year over year. In the third quarter of 2015, Intel's CCG reported $2.433 billion in operating profit, representing a substantial plunge from $3.053 billion in the year prior. This year, not only was CCG able to make up for the decline that it saw last year, but it actually managed to push past the profit levels seen in the third quarter of 2014, achieving a whopping $3.327 billion in operating profit (up 36.74%). Stacy Smith, Intel's EVP of manufacturing, operations, and sales, attributed this growth to three key factors: increased revenue, lower product costs, and lower investment levels. Let's take a closer look at each of these drivers.  Revenue leverage The first factor is simply that Intel's CCG took in more revenue last quarter than it did a year ago. Sales were up from $8.506 billion in the same quarter last year to $8.892 billion. All else being equal (operating expenses, gross profit margins), greater revenue is going to translate into higher profits. Better product manufacturing costs Investors may recall that last year, Intel transitioned a large portion of the products that it sold into the personal computer market from its older, mature 22-nanometer manufacturing technology to its newer, less healthy 14-nanometer technology. Although the move to 14 nanometers helped the company deliver better products for both notebooks and desktops, Intel faced significant manufacturing yield challenges in trying to build chips on this technology. This manifested itself as increased chip manufacturing costs that ultimately hurt Intel's gross profit margins, since Intel couldn't just pass those increased costs onto its customers. A year later, Intel's 14-nanometer technology is much more mature and manufacturing yields have improved a great deal. This has manifested itself as lower product costs, which means that year-over-year gross profit margins in this product segment have gotten better -- helping to bolster the segment's operating profits. Reduced operating expenses Operating profit doesn't just depend on gross profit margins, which are a function of production costs and average selling prices. Operating expenses in the form of research and development and marketing costs play an important role in determining operating margin. Intel announced a fairly dramatic restructuring program back in April of this year designed to lower the company's operating expenses pretty significantly. Since the company indicated that it actually planned to increase its investments in faster-growing areas such as the data center, non-volatile memory, and Internet of Things, it's likely that the bulk of the cost-cutting came from CCG. Indeed, Intel specifically said that one of the key drivers of the operating margin improvement in CCG was that "investment levels declined." Where does this business go from here? Although this business has seen robust profit growth throughout 2016, that outsized profit growth relative to revenue has largely been due to factors that only really come into play once. I don't expect Intel to make further significant operating expense reductions in this segment (cut spending too much and it's hard to deliver leadership products at a rapid cadence), and I doubt that revenue will grow much from here given the state of the personal computer market (flat to down). What I do anticipate is that, going forward, CCG will see roughly flat revenue -- up some years, down some other years, but no big moves -- and fairly stable and substantial operating income.

Analytics Oct 20, 2016, 08:00 ET Share this article BOSTON, Oct. 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The global tablet Applications Processor (AP) market declined 34 percent year-over-year falling to $889 million in 1H 2016, according to Strategy Analytics Handset Component Technologies service report, "Tablet Apps Processor Market Share Q2 2016: Tablet Apps Processor Revenue Declined 32 Percent." Click here for this report: http://sa-link.cc/1h4 Continue Reading Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161017/429324 According to this Strategy Analytics research report Apple, Qualcomm, Intel, MediaTek and Samsung LSI captured the top-five revenue share rankings in the tablet AP market in 1H 2016. Apple led the tablet AP market with 35 percent revenue share, followed by Qualcomm with 18 percent and Intel with 13 percent. Sravan Kundojjala, Associate Director, commented, "The tablet AP market continues to decline and all major tablet AP vendors suffered in 1H 2016. We estimate that ARM-based tablet APs increased their share to 89 percent in 1H 2016 from 83 percent in the same period last year. Intel's tablet AP shipments halved in 1H 2016 as the company shifted its focus away from Atom-based low-end Android tablets and towards Core-based tablets.  Windows-based tablets accounted for the majority of Intel's tablet AP shipments in 1H 2016." Stuart Robinson, Executive Director of the Strategy Analytics Handset Component Technologies service, added, "Our calculations show that baseband-integrated APs accounted for one-third of total tablet AP shipments in 1H 2016. Qualcomm, MediaTek and Spreadtrum represented over 80 percent of total baseband-integrated tablet AP shipments in 1H 2016 and Intel's recent decision to de-emphasize integrated APs will benefit these three vendors in the next few quarters."

Comments By Peter Sayer Follow IDG News Service | Oct 20, 2016 4:39 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Computer Processors Windows PCs Technology Law & Regulation Comments Intel's hope of recovering a record antitrust fine have improved with a recommendation from a top European Union judge on Thursday that the case be reviewed. The company paid the €1.06 billion (then US$1.4 billion) fine in 2009 after the European Commission found it guilty of abusing its dominant position in the market for x86 processors. Since then, it has been seeking to have the judgment overturned, first by the EU's General Court and then, since 2014, by the EU's highest legal authority, the Court of Justice. The CJEU heard that appeal in June, and now Advocate General Nils Wahl has issued his recommendation to the court. The opinions of the court's advocates general are not binding, but it often follows them. Wahl recommended Thursday that the case be referred back to the General Court for review. He disagreed with the lower court's findings on a number of points of law raised by Intel. Those points concerned the Commission's treatment of rebates Intel paid to four computer manufacturers, Dell, Lenovo, Hewlett-Packard and NEC on condition that they purchased almost all of their x86 CPUs from it, and payments it made to electronics retailer Media-Saturn on condition it sold only computers containing Intel’s x86 CPUs. The rebates and payments, the Commission said, made it harder for Intel’s competitors to compete on the merits of their x86 CPUs, reducing consumer choice and lowering the incentive to innovate. In his analysis of the General Court's handling of Intel's appeal, Wahl found the court's treatment of the rebates and payments as "exclusivity rebates" led it to overlook the capability of such rebates to restrict competition. Further, he wrote, in the case of HP and Lenovo, there was no question of exclusivity because they were still allowed by their agreements with Intel to purchase significant quantities of x86 processors from AMD. Wahl also doubted whether Intel's market position was dominant enough to be abused. By averaging Intel's market share between 2002 and 2007, he wrote, the court failed to take into account that the company's share was shrinking and by 2007 was no longer sufficient for it to restrict competition. The Commission's failure to record an interview with a Dell executive in accordance with EU law was another point on which Wahl found fault with the lower court's ruling. He even went so far as to question whether the Commission had jurisdiction over some of Intel's alleged market abuse. The lower court failed to assess whether certain agreements between Intel and Lenovo had immediate and foreseeable anticompetitive effects within the European Economic Area, of which the EU is part, he wrote. Intel failed to win Wahl's support on one point, however: the size of the fine. Although it was a record for the EU at the time, that alone doesn't make it disproportionate, and Intel did not point to any legal errors on the part of the General Court in its assessment of the fine. "I agree with the Commission that the arguments put forward by the appellant in relation to the proportionality of the fine must be declared inadmissible," he wrote. The company will now have to wait until next year for the Court of Justice to determine whether to refer the matter back to the lower court.

Click here for this report: http://sa-link.cc/1h4 Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161017/429324 Logo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161017/429324 According to this Strategy Analytics research report Apple, Qualcomm, Intel, MediaTek and Samsung LSI captured the top-five revenue share rankings in the tablet AP market in 1H 2016. Apple led the tablet AP market with 35 percent revenue share, followed by Qualcomm with 18 percent and Intel with 13 percent. Sravan Kundojjala, Associate Director, commented, "The tablet AP market continues to decline and all major tablet AP vendors suffered in 1H 2016. We estimate that ARM-based tablet APs increased their share to 89 percent in 1H 2016 from 83 percent in the same period last year. Intel's tablet AP shipments halved in 1H 2016 as the company shifted its focus away from Atom-based low-end Android tablets and towards Core-based tablets.  Windows-based tablets accounted for the majority of Intel's tablet AP shipments in 1H 2016." Stuart Robinson, Executive Director of the Strategy Analytics Handset Component Technologies service, added, "Our calculations show that baseband-integrated APs accounted for one-third of total tablet AP shipments in 1H 2016. Qualcomm, MediaTek and Spreadtrum represented over 80 percent of total baseband-integrated tablet AP shipments in 1H 2016 and Intel's recent decision to de-emphasize integrated APs will benefit these three vendors in the next few quarters."

REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun/File Photo By Pia Oppel and Foo Yun Chee | LUXEMBOURG/BRUSSELS LUXEMBOURG/BRUSSELS Intel's (INTC.O) fight against a record 1.06 billion euro ($1.16 billion) EU antitrust fine received a boost on Thursday when a top Europe court adviser questioned whether the U.S. chipmaker's actions had really harmed competition. The opinion from Advocate General Nils Wahl at the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) amounted to a rare setback for the European Commission, underlining the tough battle ahead as it takes on Apple (AAPL.O), Qualcomm (QCOM.O), Google (GOOGL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) in various competition cases. "Intel's appeal against the imposition of a 1.06 billion euro fine for abuse of its dominant position should be upheld. The case should be referred back to the General Court for a fresh review," Wahl said in a non-binding recommendation. He said the General Court failed to establish that the rebates and payments offered by Intel were anti-competitive and that certain deals between the firm and Lenovo harmed European consumers. These were key elements of the Commission's 2009 decision. The General Court rejected Intel's challenge two years ago, saying that the European Commission had not acted too harshly in handing down the record sanction amounting to 4.15 percent of Intel's 2008 turnover against a possible maximum of 10 percent. The ECJ, which usually follows the adviser's opinion in the majority of cases, is expected to rule in the coming months. The Commission declined to comment. Wahl's opinion is a good sign for companies looking for guidance on what kind of rebates should be considered harmful, said Ian Giles, a partner at London-based Norton Rose Fulbright. "The extent to which the advocate general disagrees with the Commission is significant. The advocate general's opinion says - on the Intel facts - the Commission got it wrong," he said. "Assuming the court follows this opinion, this is a good outcome from the perspective of competition policy, and may lead to the Commission revising its approach in ongoing cases." U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm is fighting EU charges of using anti-competitive methods, including giving rebates, to squeeze a rival. It will lay out its arguments at a hearing on Nov. 10. Intel's fine remains the largest for a single company for an EU antitrust infringement. The EU antitrust enforcer penalized Intel over what it called tactics aimed at stifling rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), including giving rebates to PC makers Dell [DI.UL], Hewlett-Packard Co (HPE.N), NEC (6701.T) and Lenovo (0992.HK) for buying most of their computer chips from Intel.($1 = 0.9115 euros) (Reporting by Pia Oppel, writing by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Philip Blenkinsop/Mark Heinrich) Next In Technology Photos Twitter to upgrade some features to thwart cyber-bullying Twitter, facing pressure for not doing enough to curb abusive behavior on its platform, said on Tuesday it would upgrade some features to better combat cyber-bullying.

The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, in 2009 slapped a record fine of 1.06 billion euros ($1.16 billion) on Intel after it said the company had offered clients price rebates to use its own computer chips in preference to rival AMD. Intel then appealed to the General Court, second only to the European Court of Justice, but lost the case in 2014. In dismissing the appeal that year, the lower EU court had "erred" and the case should now be referred back for the General Court "to examine all the circumstances of the case," the ECJ's Advocate General Nils Wahl said in a statement. The ECJ is not obliged to follow the advocate general's rulings when it hands down its final decision but it frequently does. A victory for Intel would be rare defeat for the European Commission that is facing a similar court battle with Apple over its decision in August to force the iconic iPhone maker to pay 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland.

The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, in 2009 slapped a record fine of 1.06 billion euros ($1.16 billion) on Intel after it said the company had offered clients price rebates to use its own computer chips in preference to rival AMD. Intel then appealed to the General Court, second only to the European Court of Justice, but lost the case in 2014. EU slapped Intel with a record fine of 1.06 billion euros for offering clients price rebates to use its own computer chips in preference to rival AMD ©Remy Gabalda (AFP/File) In dismissing the appeal that year, the lower EU court had "erred" and the case should now be referred back for the General Court "to examine all the circumstances of the case," the ECJ's Advocate General Nils Wahl said in a statement. The ECJ is not obliged to follow the advocate general's rulings when it hands down its final decision but it frequently does. A victory for Intel would be rare defeat for the European Commission that is facing a similar court battle with Apple over its decision in August to force the iconic iPhone maker to pay 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland.

The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, in 2009 slapped a record fine of 1.06 billion euros ($1.16 billion) on Intel after it said the company had offered clients price rebates to use its own computer chips in preference to rival AMD. Intel then appealed to the General Court, second only to the European Court of Justice, but lost the case in 2014. In dismissing the appeal that year, the lower EU court had "erred" and the case should now be referred back for the General Court "to examine all the circumstances of the case," the ECJ's Advocate General Nils Wahl said in a statement. The ECJ is not obliged to follow the advocate general's rulings when it hands down its final decision but it frequently does. A victory for Intel would be rare defeat for the European Commission that is facing a similar court battle with Apple over its decision in August to force the iconic iPhone maker to pay 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland.

Kate needs to replace an ancient laptop and for ergonomic reasons she’d like an all-in-one PC instead The Asus Zen AiO ZN220 comes highly recommended. Photograph: Asus Jack Schofield Thursday 20 October 2016 05.34 EDT Last modified on Thursday 20 October 2016 09.08 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger I have an ancient laptop that needs replacing as soon as possible. I have a desk at home and do not need the portability of a laptop, but I would like an all-in-one to stop me hunching over the screen. I will use it for web browsing, sending emails, collating photos, and tasks like my ancestry research. What would you recommend? Kate All-in-one computers generally use much the same technologies as laptops, but they are packaged differently. You are correct in thinking that all-in-ones are much better ergonomically, and they usually have bigger screens than laptops – typically 20-30in rather than 10-17in. All-in-one PCs are much tidier than desktop PCs, especially if you use a wireless keyboard and mouse. Also, they take up less room and are easier to move around. However, they are not as easy to repair or to expand. Buying more power and more memory than you need will provide some future-proofing. Either way, I recommend you visit a retailer than stocks all-in-ones, such as John Lewis or Currys PC World, so that you can check the screen, construction quality and finish first hand. The keyboard and mouse are not so important as you can easily upgrade these later. Recommended systems For best results, go for an all-in-one with an Intel Core processor, 8GB of memory, a 1TB or larger hard drive, and Microsoft Windows 10. You should be able to do everything you want with a Core i3, but if you can afford it, it’s better to have a Core i5. You don’t need to pay for the extra power of a Core i7. At the time of writing, I’d go for the Asus Zen AiO ZN220IC. This has a 21.5in touch-screen with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, a Core i3-6100U processor, 8GB of memory and 1TB hard drive, all for £579.99. The same AiO PC is also available with a faster Core i5-6400T for £665 or less. Prices and services vary so shop around. There’s also a version with a Core i3 and only 4GB of memory for £499.99. If that’s as far as your budget stretches, it will do the job. The Zen AiO is built like an Apple iMac all-in-one – from the back, they look almost identical – but cheaper. The main drawback is that it’s extremely difficult to open, to add more memory or a faster hard drive. Don’t like the Zen? Dell sells a similar but less stylish all-in-one, the Inspiron 22 3000, with a Core i5-6200U, 8GB of memory and 1TB hard drive for £649 including delivery. Be careful not to confuse it with the older model, which had a kick-stand. HP offers the HP Pavilion 23-q252na with a Core i5-6400T, 8GB of memory and a 2TB hard drive for £749.95. I suspect that’s too much for you. Budget options If you want to spend as little as possible, look at the Lenovo C20. It has a 19.5in non-touch screen, an Intel Celeron J3160 processor, 4GB of memory, a 1TB hard drive and a built-in DVD for £319.99 at PC World, Argos and other stores. It’s obviously not a premium product, but it’s terrific value for money. It has two drawbacks. First, the screen resolution is only 1366 x 768 pixels. Like your old laptop, it’s HD instead of Full HD. Second, the Celeron J3160 is fairly a slow processor, roughly equivalent to an Intel Atom x7-Z8700. The J3160’s main advantage is on-chip support for H.264 and VC1 encoding and decoding, which helps when playing videos. There’s a slightly cheaper version of the Lenovo C20 with a 500GB instead of a 1TB hard drive for £299.99. There’s also a slightly more expensive version (£349.99) with a Pentium J3710 processor. However, this is basically the same chip with a slightly faster graphics unit. In Intel branding terms, Pentiums are better than Celerons, but in this case, it’s not really worth the extra cost. However, both the Celeron J3160 and Pentium J3710 are better than the old Celeron N3050, which only has two processor cores instead of four. John Lewis also offers a C20 variant with the slightly better Pentium J3710 processor and 8GB of memory instead of 4GB, which is reasonable value at £379.95. However, at that level, you’d be better off paying £399.99 for the 21.5in HP 22-b020na. This has a Full HD screen (1920 x 1080 pixels), a Pentium J3710 processor, 8GB of memory, 1TB hard drive and DVD. It looks nicer than the Lenovo C20, and the extra £80 buys some significant advantages: much better screen resolution, twice the memory, and a slightly faster processor. (Note: be careful not to buy an HP 22-b000na, which has a dual-core Celeron J3060 instead of the quad-core chip.) Upmarket all-in-ones There are plenty of options for users with up to £2,000 to spend on an all-in-one PC. The extra money usually buys you high-resolution 24in, 27in or larger screens, faster Intel Core i5 or i7 processors, dedicated graphics cards, 16GB or 32GB of memory, and very responsive SSD (solid-state disk) drives instead of slow rotating hard drives. There are lots of more powerful versions of the Asus Zen AiO, up to and including the Z240. This has a 4K (3840 x 2160-pixel) screen, an Intel Core i7-6700T with 32GB of memory, an Nvidia GeForce GTX960M graphics card with 4GB of memory, a 1TB hard drive and a 512GB SSD for £1,999.95. HP’s Envy range also has some interesting widescreen models. The Curved 34-a090na, for example, has a 34in widescreen with a resolution of 3440 x 1440 pixels, a Core i7-6700T processor and 8GB of memory for the same £1,999.95 price. For people who prefer the macOS operating system, there are several all-in-one iMacs. The entry level model has a 21.5in screen with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, a Core i5, 8GB of memory and a 1TB hard drive for £899. A 4K Retina display and a faster Core i5 pushes the price up to £1,119. You can also get iMacs with 27in 5120 x 2880-pixel screens, Core i5 processors and 8GB of memory for £1,449 to £1,849. Upgrading the top model to a fast Core i7, 32GB of memory etc enables you to spend from £2,500 to well over £3,000. However, Apple is launching some new PCs next Thursday (27 October) in San Francisco. I’m not expecting the iMacs to change dramatically, but best wait and see. The Apple event will take place one day later than a Microsoft launch in New York. This could include a rumoured Surface AIO all-in-one, but it won’t be cheap. Have you got another question for Jack?

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 4:50 PM, October 20, 2016 Updated: 6:40 PM, October 20, 2016 LUXEMBOURG/BRUSSELS - Intel's <INTC.O> fight against a record 1.06 billion euro ($1.16 billion) EU antitrust fine received a boost on Thursday when a top Europe court adviser questioned whether the U.S. chipmaker's actions had really harmed competition. The opinion from Advocate General Nils Wahl at the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) amounted to a rare setback for the European Commission, underlining the tough battle ahead as it takes on Apple <AAPL.O>, Qualcomm <QCOM.O>, Google <GOOGL.O> and Amazon <AMZN.O> in various competition cases. "Intel's appeal against the imposition of a 1.06 billion euro fine for abuse of its dominant position should be upheld. The case should be referred back to the General Court for a fresh review," Wahl said in a non-binding recommendation. He said the General Court failed to establish that the rebates and payments offered by Intel were anti-competitive and that certain deals between the firm and Lenovo harmed European consumers. These were key elements of the Commission's 2009 decision. The General Court rejected Intel's challenge two years ago, saying that the European Commission had not acted too harshly in handing down the record sanction amounting to 4.15 percent of Intel's 2008 turnover against a possible maximum of 10 percent. The ECJ, which usually follows the adviser's opinion in the majority of cases, is expected to rule in the coming months. The Commission declined to comment. Wahl's opinion is a good sign for companies looking for guidance on what kind of rebates should be considered harmful, said Ian Giles, a partner at London-based Norton Rose Fulbright. "The extent to which the advocate general disagrees with the Commission is significant. The advocate general's opinion says - on the Intel facts - the Commission got it wrong," he said. "Assuming the court follows this opinion, this is a good outcome from the perspective of competition policy, and may lead to the Commission revising its approach in ongoing cases." U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm is fighting EU charges of using anti-competitive methods, including giving rebates, to squeeze a rival. It will lay out its arguments at a hearing on Nov. 10. Intel's fine remains the largest for a single company for an EU antitrust infringement. The EU antitrust enforcer penalized Intel over what it called tactics aimed at stifling rival Advanced Micro Devices <AMD.O>, including giving rebates to PC makers Dell [DI.UL], Hewlett-Packard Co <HPE.N>, NEC <6701.T> and Lenovo <0992.HK> for buying most of their computer chips from Intel.($1 = 0.9115 euros) REUTERS mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most Business READ COMMENTED “India really means business”: Iswaran ’appy iPhone users as WhatsApp Web goes iOS ‘Your fried rice’s ready, Chef’ ‘Unicorns’ face up to reality of new dotcom bubble ‘Tweaks' to property cooling measures worth exploring, say industry players Yum unit Taco Bell to have 8,000 U.S. outlets by end-2022 World debut: Jaguar unveils all-electric I-Pace SUV With 'change in the air', PM May asks business to help on economy While India plugs black money holes, Indians find leaks What’s most worrying about the current economic climate?

Intel’s appeal should be totally re-examined by a lower court, which blundered by ruling against the company’s system of rebates for PC makers using its chips, Advocate General Nils Wahl of the EU Court of Justice said in a non-binding opinion Thursday. The top court will decide whether to back his views in a ruling expected within about six months. “If the court follows, this could be the most important ruling of the past 25 years because it’s the complete destruction of the judgment of the General Court but also of the European Commission’s position," said Damien Geradin, a lawyer at EDGE Legal in Brussels. The lower tribunal was wrong to single out “exclusivity rebates” paid to customers who bought most or all of their chips from Intel, he said. The General Court’s analysis failed to show that the rebates harmed competition. The commission in Brussels and Intel declined to comment. EU Spotlight A victory for Intel would throw the spotlight on EU antitrust regulators facing a court clash with Ireland and Apple over the fairness of a probe that culminated in the iPhone maker’s 13 billion-euro tax bill. The Intel ruling may also affect the EU’s handling of probes into Google and Qualcomm Inc. that could ultimately lead to fines. Intel’s 2009 antitrust fine was the EU’s biggest, more than double the 497 million-euro penalty against Microsoft Corp. in 2004. It represented about 4 percent of Intel’s $37.6 billion in sales in 2008, below the maximum penalty of 10 percent of yearly sales regulators can impose. In light of “the errors committed” by the General Court, Wahl said a final ruling by the top tribunal wasn’t possible at this stage. “That is because a decision on the merits hinges upon the examination of all the circumstances of the case” and of “the actual or potential effect of Intel’s conduct on competition” in the EU. Given this involves a revision of the facts in the case, it will have to be sent back to the lower EU court, he said. The EU’s top court can only analyze points of law. ‘Very Many Years’ If Intel ultimately prevails, it would be the commission’s first defeat in a case concerning so-called abuse of dominance by a company for “very many years,” said Trevor Soames, a competition lawyer in Brussels. “The line of success on the part of the commission will be stopped in its tracks.” "One of the big problems in dominance cases over the last 10 years has been a lack of confidence that on appeal in Luxembourg there would be a substantive review” and “that basically you were almost inevitably going to lose a dominance appeal,” he said. While urging a review of the case, Wahl said the fact that the fine was record-breaking doesn’t necessarily mean it was inappropriate -- provided it is eventually shown that Intel broke EU law. The EU’s eight-year investigation found that Intel impeded competition by giving rebates to computer makers from 2002 until 2005 on the condition that they buy at least 95 percent of chips for PCs from Intel. The EU regulator said Intel imposed “restrictive conditions” for the remaining 5 percent, supplied by Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which struggled to overcome Intel’s hold on the market for processors that run PCs. Dell Meeting Acer Inc., Dell Inc., Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo Group Ltd. and NEC Corp., were among computer firms coaxed to use Intel chips, the commission said in 2009. The EU ordered Intel to stop using illegal rebates to thwart competitors, an instruction that Intel complained was unclear. Qualcomm will be watching the Intel case as it battles EU allegations that it paid an unidentified phone manufacturer to use its chipset. It will defend itself next month at a closed-door hearing examining a second set of charges that it sold chips below-cost to harm a smaller rival. Wahl was critical of the EU’s handling of evidence it gathered against Intel, saying the lower court was wrong to say regulators could add details of a meeting with a Dell executive long after the fact. Any ruling on this point may echo challenges that Ireland and Apple are preparing against the process leading up to the EU’s tax decision in August. The appeals may argue that EU regulators unfairly kept them in the dark during the probe and neglected to flag a shift in emphasis in the investigation, people with knowledge of their case have said. Sunnyvale, California-based AMD, which initiated the EU antitrust case, is no longer involved in the case and didn’t intervene in the EU court hearings. The case is:  C-413/14 P, Intel Corporation v. Commission. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

However, after 7 consecutive quarters of declining tablet sales, it is hard to see how Apple’s second best product, the iPad will soon see a slow death despite the fact that it outdid Micrsoft’s Surface tablet PCs as per the last IDC report. The Apple iPhone may be the company’s hero product, but with falling smartphone and tablet sales, Apple now seems to be focussing on a forgotten line of products that started it all, the Mac. Apple’s Mac lineup has been ignored for quite some time now. The only Mac product that Apple sells with an up to date chipset is its recently announced 2016 MacBook. There’s the Mac Pro that stuck with an Intel Ivy Bridge-E CPU, which was last updated in 2013, the MacBook Pro 15-inch which features an Intel Haswell CPU and was updated in 2014 and finally the MacBook Air with an Intel Broadwell CPU. Steve Jobs unveiled the Macbook Air from an envelope and it still looks the same 8 years later. The MacBook Air despite being on of the best value for money buys in Apple’s Mac lineup has yet to see a redesign or an update. It packs in an old TN display with non Retina resolution and a fifth-generation chipset, while Asus, Dell offer the latest for roughly the same price. While I would love to sit and admire Apple’s marketing team (since people are still buying these old systems) it is easy to tell, that Apple’s focus in the past two years was on its iPad. Apple iPad Pro 9.7 inch Apple launched the powerful iPad Pro models last year (November 2015), and it was clear that the company was looking to get PC users under its fold with the same. Soon enough Apple added another Pro variant with the 9.7-inch model with the hopes that those who found the 12-inch too-big would be happy to go in for this one. But that turned out to be a flop show as well. The company lost out because not only were the Pro models priced too high, but they ran the same iOS as its smartphones, which is not something a power user who usually pays for an ultra-book would be interested in. Adding to the mess was Apple’s idea to ape Microsoft with a soft keyboard, that somehow did not cover up for its lacking software productivity. With the tablet sales still declining Apple seems to have woken up and is now for once actually holding an event for its updated Mac lineup. Think of it as a Plan B where the Plan A with the iPad seems to have failed, despite repeated efforts. Apple MacBook 2016 So wit the iPad out fizzing out (they are still planning three new models next year), the next mobile device in line would have to be the old and neglected laptop lineup. So why is the Apple iPad failing? As Digital Trends points out, it is the upgrade cycle. Tablet users simply do not feel the need to upgrade to a new or the latest model, as they are often used for secondary tasks. With smartphones screen sizes getting bigger, more can be accomplished with the device that is in your hand, rather than the one in your bag, that well… needs two hands. Why would one need an iPad Pro (Rs 93,000 256GB) when you have MacBook (Rs 1,00,000 512GB, 8GB RAM) that is equally light, priced the same and can do so much more? Microsoft’s Windows 10 and its manufacturers have moved ahead of Apple when it comes to hardware and software, let’s hope Plan B works out as smartphones and tablets are just not cutting it, while Plan C with the Apple Car just got shelved.

By Matt Bach on Oct 19, 2016, 4:45 PM 16 comments TechSpot Editor’s Note: Matt Bach is the head of Puget Labs and has been part of Puget Systems, a boutique builder of gaming and workstation PCs, since the early days. This article was originally published on the Puget blog. While not yet a common term, over the past year or so we have started to see a rise in the usage of the term "Aggregate CPU Frequency" as a way to estimate the performance between different CPU models. This term appears to be used most often when people are discussing high core count Xeon or dual Xeon CPU configurations, but lately we have seen it used when looking at CPUs with as few as just four cores. At first glance, this term seems reasonable enough: it simply takes the frequency of the CPU (how fast it can complete calculations) and multiplies it by the number of cores (the number of simultaneous calculations it can perform) to arrive at a total or "aggregate" frequency for the processor. For example, below is the number of cores and base frequency for four different CPU models along with their calculated "aggregate frequency": No. of cores Base frequency Aggregate frequency Intel Core i7 6700K 4 cores 4.0 GHz 4*4 = 16 GHz Intel Xeon E5-1650 V3 6 cores 3.5 GHz 6*3.5 = 21 GHz Intel Core i7 6850K 6 cores 3.6 GHz 6*3.6 = 21.6 GHz 2x Intel Xeon E5-2690 V4 28 cores 2.6 GHz 28*2.6 = 72.8 GHz Unfortunately, in the majority of cases trying to estimate the relative performance of a CPU in this manner is simply going to give you inaccurate and wrong results. So before this term begins to be used more commonly, we wanted to to explain why "aggregate frequency" should not be used and give some examples showing how (in)accurate it really is. There are quite a few reasons why "aggregate frequency" is an inaccurate representation of CPU performance, but the largest primary reasons are the following: It is typically calculated using the advertised base frequency Most modern Intel CPUs have a wide range of frequencies they run at including the base frequency (the frequency that is advertised in the model name) and the various Turbo frequencies. Turbo Boost allows the CPU to run at higher frequencies depending on three main factors: the number of cores being used, the temperature of the cores, and the amount of power available to the CPU. On modern desktop systems with quality components, however, the cooling and power considerations are pretty much non-factors which means that the frequency of an Intel CPU should only be limited by the number of cores that are being used. In fact, Turbo Boost is so reliable on modern CPUs that, except in a few edge cases, every system that ships out our door is checked to ensure that it is able to maintain the all-core Turbo Frequency even when the system is put under an extremely heavy load. How big of a difference would it make to use the all-core Turbo Boost frequency instead of the base frequency? If you were to calculate the "aggregate frequency" for an Intel Xeon E5-2690 V4 CPU, you would get a result of 36.4 GHz since that CPU has 14 cores and a base frequency of 2.6 GHz. However, if you instead use the all-core Turbo frequency of 3.2 GHz (which any well-designed and adequately cooled workstation should be able to achieve indefinitely), the aggregate frequency changes to 44.8 GHz which is a difference of 30%. It does not take the rest of the CPU and system specs into account including the amount of cache, architecture, and chipset Processors are extremely complex, and just looking at the number of cores and frequency ignores everything else that can make one CPU faster or slower than another. This can include the amount of cache (whether it is L1, L2, L3, or Smart Cache), the bus type and speed, and the type and speed of memory it can use. However, more than almost anything else it ignores the architecture and manufacturing process that was used to produce the CPU. While the amount of difference all of these other specs can make varies from application to application, as an example we saw up to a 35% difference in SOLIDWORKS between a Skylake CPU and a Haswell-E CPU when both were operating with 4 cores at 4.0 GHz. It assumes that programs can make perfect use of all the CPU cores More than anything else, this is the main problem with aggregate frequency. Using the base frequency can throw things off, but in most cases probably only by a maximum of about 10-30%. Likewise, as long as you only compare CPUs from the same product family, the architecture of the CPUs likely won't come into play. But working under the assumption that a program is going to be able to make perfect use of all of the CPUs cores is just so wrong that that it makes using an "aggregate frequency" less accurate in most cases than simply choosing a CPU at random. It appears that most people who use this term understand that there are some programs that are single threaded (parametric CAD programs are a prime example), but many of our articles have shown over and over that even if a program tries to use all the available cores, how effectively it can do varies wildly. The reason depends on a number of factors including how the program is coded, how well the task lends itself to multi-threading, and how much the other components in the system (including the hard drive, GPU, and RAM) affect performance. There are some programs that are very effective at utilizing multiple CPU cores in parallel, but even the best of them (such as offline rendering) are at best only ~99.5% efficient, and often as low as 90% efficient. This is extremely good, but still low enough that it will throw off any attempt to use an "aggregate frequency" to estimate performance. Unfortunately, the only way to know how well a program can use multiple cores is to do comprehensive testing on that specific application. We have tested a number of programs including Premiere Pro, After Effects, Photoshop, Lightroom, SOLIDWORKS, Keyshot, Iray, Mental Ray, and Photoscan, but this is only a tiny drop in a giant bucket compared to the number of programs that exist today. Examples We can talk about all the reasons why we believe "aggregate frequency" is wildly inaccurate, but there is no substitution for specific examples using actual benchmark data. To help prove our point, we are going to look at a number of different applications and compare the performance between a variety of CPUs using the "aggregate frequency" and the actual performance in reality. We like to be fair, so to give this term the best chance possible we are only going to use CPUs with same architecture (Broadwell-E/EP). If you were to mix older and newer architectures (such as a Core i7 6700K versus a Core i7 6850K or a Xeon V3 versus a Xeon V4), expect the "aggregate frequency" to become even more inaccurate. To make it easier to see how close or far from reality the "aggregate frequency" is, whenever the expected performance using the "aggregate frequency" is within 10% of the actual performance, we will color the results in green. Anything that is 10-50% off will be in orange, and anything more than 50% off will be in red. Example 1: Cinema4D CPU Rendering Offline rendering of 3D images and animations is among the most efficient tasks you can run on a CPU which makes rendering engines like those found in Cinema4D exceptional at using high numbers of CPU cores. This also makes it a best-case scenario for the term "aggregate frequency": CineBench R15 Multi CPU Specs Aggregate Frequency Expected Performance Compared to Core i7 6850K Actual Performance Compared to Core i7 6850K Intel Core i7 6850K 6 Cores, 3.6 GHz (3.7-4.0 GHz Turbo) 21.6 GHz 100% 100% Intel Core i7 6950X 10 Cores, 3.0 GHz (3.4-4.0 GHz Turbo) 30 GHz 139% 156% (off by 17%) 2x Intel Xeon E5-2630 V4 20 Cores, 2.2 GHz (2.4-3.1 GHz Turbo) 44 GHz 204% 207% (off by 3%) 2x Intel Xeon E5-2690 V4 28 Cores, 2.6 GHz (3.2-3.5 GHz Turbo) 72.8 GHz 337% 358% (off by 21%) We run CineBench R15 on nearly every system that goes out our door, and the results above are taken directly from our benchmark logs. Comparing the expected performance to the actual performance between the different CPUs, in every case the "aggregate frequency" ended up expecting lower performance than what each CPU was able to achieve in reality. The most accurate result was the dual Xeon E5-2630 V4 in which the expected performance difference compared to the i7 6850K was only off by about 3% which is actually extremely accurate. However, the other two CPU results were off by about 20% which means that although "aggregate frequency" has a chance of being fairly accurate, it also has a good chance of being off by a moderate amount. Example 2: Premiere Pro We have found in previous testing that Premiere Pro is decently effective at using a moderate amount of CPU cores, but with modern hardware there is little need for something like a dual CPU workstation. Still, there are many recommendations on the web to use a dual Xeon workstation for Premiere Pro, so lets take a look at how the actual performance you would see in Premiere Pro compares to what you would expect from the "aggregate frequency": CineBench R15 Multi CPU Specs Aggregate Frequency Expected Performance Compared to Core i7 6850K Actual Performance Compared to Core i7 6850K Intel Core i7 6850K 6 Cores, 3.6 GHz (3.7-4.0 GHz Turbo) 21.6 GHz 100% 100% Intel Core i7 6950X 10 Cores, 3.0 GHz (3.4-4.0 GHz Turbo) 30 GHz 139% 123% (off by 16%) 2x Intel Xeon E5-2630 V4 20 Cores, 2.2 GHz (2.4-3.1 GHz Turbo) 44 GHz 189% 117% (off by 77%) 2x Intel Xeon E5-2690 V4 28 Cores, 2.6 GHz (3.2-3.5 GHz Turbo) 72.8 GHz 337% 111% (off by 226%) The results in the chart above are taken from this Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2015.3 CPU Comparison article where we looked at exporting and generating previews in Premiere Pro with a variety of codecs and resolutions. While the results aren't too far off with somewhat similar CPUs, the "aggregate frequency" expected the i7 6950X to be about 16% faster compared to the i7 6850K than it is in reality. This isn't completely out in left field, but the difference between a 39% improvement in performance and a 23% improvement from a CPU that is more than twice as expensive is likely to make quite a big difference if you are trying to decide on which CPU to purchase. For the dual CPU options, the "aggregate frequency" was much further off from reality being about 77% off on the dual Xeon E5-2643 V4 and a huge 226% off on the dual Xeon E5-2690 V4. In fact, where the "aggregate frequency" predicted the dual E5-2690 V4 CPUs to be the fastest option, they were in fact slower than the dual E5-2643 V4 CPUs (or even the Core i7 6950X) while costing significantly more. Example 3: 3ds Max 3ds Max is a 3d modeling and animation program that is primarily single threaded, so you would expect it to be a worst case scenario for "aggregate frequency". You may argue that no one should use this term for these types of lightly threaded tasks, but we have started to see this term pop up even when talking about single or lightly threaded tasks so we wanted to show just how inaccurate it may be when someone uses "aggregate frequency" as a catch-all term for CPU performance: CineBench R15 Multi CPU Specs Aggregate Frequency Expected Performance Compared to Core i7 6850K Actual Performance Compared to Core i7 6850K Intel Core i7 6850K 6 Cores, 3.6 GHz (3.7-4.0 GHz Turbo) 21.6 GHz 100% 100% Intel Core i7 6950X 10 Cores, 3.0 GHz (3.4-4.0 GHz Turbo) 30 GHz 139% 102% (off by 37%) 2x Intel Xeon E5-2690 V4 28 Cores, 2.6 GHz (3.2-3.5 GHz Turbo) 72.8 GHz 337% 89% (off by 248%) The results in the chart above are taken from this AutoDesk 3ds Max 2017 CPU Performance article where we looked at animations, viewport FPS, and scanline rendering with a variety of projects. As expected from a mostly single-threaded application, the "aggregate frequency" was very optimistic in each case. Depending on which CPU you look at, the expected performance if you used the "Aggregate frequency" compared to the actual performance ranged from being 37% off to being 248% off! On the extreme end - with a pair of high core count Xeons - this means that instead of more than a 3x increase in performance compared to a i7 6850K, in reality you would actually see a 10% decrease in performance. Example 4: After Effects After Effects is an interesting application because it used to be very well threaded and benefited greatly from high core count workstations. However, in the 2015 version Adobe changed it's focus from multi-threading to GPU acceleration. In the long-term this should greatly improve performance for AE users, but the result is that with modern hardware there is little need for a CPU with more than 6-8 CPU cores and often actually a decrease in performance with higher core count and dual CPU setups. So while you may think a single-threaded application like 3ds Max would be the worst case for the term "aggregate frequency", After Effects should be even worse: CineBench R15 Multi CPU Specs Aggregate Frequency Expected Performance Compared to Core i7 6850K Actual Performance Compared to Core i7 6850K Intel Core i7 6850K 6 Cores, 3.6 GHz (3.7-4.0 GHz Turbo) 21.6 GHz 100% 100% Intel Core i7 6950X 10 Cores, 3.0 GHz (3.4-4.0 GHz Turbo) 30 GHz 139% 96% (off by 43%) 2x Intel Xeon E5-2630 V4 20 Cores, 2.2 GHz (2.4-3.1 GHz Turbo) 44 GHz 189% 90% (off by 99%) 2x Intel Xeon E5-2690 V4 28 Cores, 2.6 GHz (3.2-3.5 GHz Turbo) 72.8 GHz 337% 86% (off by 251%) The results in the chart above are taken from the 2D Animation portion of our Adobe After Effects CC 2015.3 CPU Comparison article which tested rendering and timeline scrubbing across six different projects. As you can see, trying to use an "aggregate frequency" to estimate the difference between different CPU models is going to be wildly inaccurate. Compared to the i7 6850K, the other CPU choices - which should be anywhere from 39% faster to over 3 times faster - are instead all slower than the Core i7 6850K. In fact, the faster the "aggregate frequency" predicted a CPU configuration to be, the slower it ended up being in reality! The allure of an all-pervasive specification like "aggregate frequency" is something we completely understand. It would be great if there was an easy way to know which CPU will be faster than another and by roughly how much, but unfortunately there is no magic bullet. To be completely fair, for highly threaded tasks like rendering, the "aggregate frequency" should be close enough that you at least wouldn't end up spending more money for lower performance, but it still isn't going to be great at estimating precisely how much of a performance increase you would see with one CPU over another. Outside of rendering and a few other highly parallel applications, however, there is no way to know whether the "aggregate frequency" is going to be accurate or not without detailed benchmarking. For example, simulations are often touted as being highly parallel (which means it should be perfect for this term), but we have found that performing simulations in SOLIDWORKS is only moderately efficient - worse in many cases than Premiere Pro! Other simulations packages like ANSYS or COMSOL should be more efficient, but without specific testing there is no way to know for sure. So if "aggregate frequency" is not accurate, what should people use to decide which CPU to purchase? Like we said earlier, there is no magic bullet for this. If your application is CPU-bound (the GPU, HD, and RAM don't impact performance significantly), you could use Amdahl's Law which taken into account the parallel efficiency of the program to calculate the theoretical performance difference between two CPUs. If you are interested in this, we recommend reading our guide on how to use Amdahl's Law. You are still limited to CPUs of the same architecture, it doesn't take into account things like CPU cache, and you have to do a lot of testing up front to determine the parallel efficiency of the program - but this method should be much more accurate than simply multiplying together a CPU's cores and frequency. If your application does utilize the GPU to improve performance or if you want to compare CPUs with different architectures, however, there is really no easy way to estimate which CPU will be faster than another and by how much. In these situations, the only reliable method is good old-fashioned benchmarking. Again, we wish there was a better method that was still accurate - it would save us so much time! - but this is simply the fact of reality. This is why we at Puget Systems have started to benchmark different CPUs on as many professional applications as we have the time and expertise to handle to ensure that we are recommending exactly the right CPU to our customers. We unfortunately can't test every program we wish we could (or really even a majority), but keep on an eye on our article list as we expand our testing across more and more applications.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 19, 2016 at 9:26PM Image source: Intel.  On Oct. 18, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2016. Arguably, the most disappointing aspect of the results -- even though they were, in aggregate, quite good -- was the fact that the company's data-center group, or DCG, grew at just 10% year-over-year, missing expectations. Although the top-line miss in this segment was disappointing, some investors might also be concerned that, even with 10% revenue growth in this segment, operating profit actually declined year over year from $2.13 billion to $2.11 billion. Or put another way, operating margin in this segment fell from 51.45% to 46.46%. What drove this operating margin reduction? Let's take a closer look. The ramp of 14-nanometer server chips In the third quarter of 2015, Intel's latest server processors were manufactured in the company's mature 22-nanometer technology. By the third quarter of 2016, however, Intel's main server processor lineup had transitioned to the company's newer 14-nanometer manufacturing technology. This transition to chips built on this newer technology is a driver of the reduced profitability in Intel's data-center group, according to Intel. The transition to the 14-nanometer tech allowed Intel to cram more processor cores into its new chips than it was able to with the 22-nanometer parts, thereby improving performance. However, because Intel's manufacturing yields on the newer technology still haven't reached full maturity, these new chips are more expensive to build than their predecessors. Increased investments The drop in profitability year over year isn't just driven by the transition to 14-nanometer technology -- operating expenses are on the way up, too. "We have been very consciously increasing investment [in DCG] there; we see tremendous long-term opportunity, so that's been an ongoing process for us," Intel Executive Vice President Stacy Smith said on the call. It makes perfect sense for Intel to bolster its spending in this segment. Many chip companies have been quite public about their efforts to try to capture share from Intel in the server market, so the appropriate response on Intel's part is to invest more to make sure its future products are at least as competitive relative to other offerings as its current products are today. Looking ahead The good news is that Intel is likely to see the margin headwinds associated with the 14-nanometer ramp fade next year as manufacturing yields are expected to continue to improve. So in a scenario where operating expenses stay flat and revenues grow for the year, I would expect Intel's operating profit to grow nicely next year. However, it's not clear what Intel's plans are with respect to operating expenses in this segment going forward. It wouldn't be surprising to see Intel continuing to increase its investments here given the importance of DCG to the company's long-term future, but the magnitude of such an investment increase is something that won't become clear until the company's investor meeting in February of next year. The good news, though, is that, as the 14-nanometer margin headwind abates, the company should have room to increase its investments while still delivering some level of profit growth -- assuming similar business dynamics to what this business saw in 2016.

Revenue at the world’s largest semiconductor maker will be $15.7bn (€14.26bn), plus or minus $500m (€456m), the company said, falling short of analysts’ estimates of $15.9bn (€14.5bn). Intel’s third-quarter sales reached a record, lifted by processor orders from PC makers that decided to shore up their chip supplies ahead of the holiday shopping season. So far, demand hasn’t come surging back, meaning that customers will again pare orders as they work through those stockpiles of chips. It also backed off an annual forecast for double-digit revenue growth in server chips for data centres and corporate networks, its most profitable business. “We’re not going to raise the flag and say everything’s good again,” chief executive Brian Krzanich said. Intel shares are now 3.5% higher than at the start of the year. Third-quarter net income rose to $3.38bn (€3.08bn), compared with $3.11bn (€2.84bn) in the same period a year earlier. Revenue rose 9.1% to $15.8bn (€14.4bn). The company’s client computing group, which sells PC chips, posted third-quarter sales of $8.89bn (€8.11bn), a gain of 4.5% from a year earlier. Demand for PCs will increase in the fourth quarter in line with normal seasonal gains, the company said. “It’s my concern that we just have an inventory build that could carry on into the first quarter,” said Kevin Cassidy, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. While the PC market isn’t getting worse, it’s still shrinking. Worldwide shipments fell 3.9% in the third quarter, market researcher IDC said earlier this month, a smaller drop than the decline of 4.1% in the second quarter. Meanwhile, Dutch chip-making equipment manufacturer ASML, a key supplier to Intel and Samsung yesterday reported a 23% rise in third-quarter profit, missing analyst estimates. Net profit reached €396m for July-September from €322m in the same period a year earlier. However, sales of €1.82bn beat analysts expectations of €1.72bn on the back of higher sales of ASML’s newest machines. ASML forecast fourth-quarter revenue of €1.7bn-€1.8bn. Perhaps of greatest interest to company watchers, ASML reported three orders for the new machine, the NXE:3400 EUV system. CEO Peter Wennink said six customers were “now actively engaged in the EUV introduction in both memory and logic.” As a result, the company booked €1.42bn worth of new orders in the quarter. ASML shares in Amsterdam rose 2.2%. READ MORE Visit the section home page here KEYWORDS business, finance, economy, intel, shares, sales © Irish Examiner Ltd.

Dmitry Evtyushkin and Dmitry Ponomarev, a Ph.D. student and professor, respectively, in the department of computer science at SUNY Binghamton, and Nael Abu-Ghazaleh, professor and computer scientist at the University of California, Riverside, described an attack that could reliably recover kernel address space layout randomization (ASLR) "in about 60 milliseconds when performed on a real Haswell processor running a recent version of Linux," in their paper, "Jump Over ASLR: Attacking Branch Predictors to Bypass ASLR." According to the researchers, the trouble arises from Intel's use of the branch target buffer (BTB) in its chips. "Branch predictors are critical to performance of modern processors. One of the main components of the branch prediction hardware is the branch target buffer," they wrote. "The BTB stores target addresses of recently executed branch instructions, so that those addresses can be obtained directly from a BTB lookup to fetch instructions starting at the target in the next cycle. Since the BTB is shared by several applications executing on the same core, information leakage from one application to another through the BTB side channel is possible." Abu-Ghazaleh told SearchSecurity although the team used Intel's Haswell chips for testing, "It's likely that [other Intel chips] are vulnerable as well, since they use the same general principles for the branch predictor, but the specifics and whether we can recover all of ASLR depends on the configuration." In the new attack described by the researchers, using the side-channel information from the BTB allows an attacker to "recover all random bits of the kernel addresses and reduce the entropy of user-level randomization." "Our attack only requires the control of a user-level process and does not rely on any explicit memory disclosures," the researchers wrote. "The key insight that makes the new BTB-based side channel possible is that the BTB collisions between two user-level processes, and between a user process and the kernel, can be created by the attacker in a controlled and robust manner." The researchers said the purpose of ASLR "is to make it difficult, if not impossible, for the attacker to know the location of specific code pages in the program's address space." So, being able to bypass ASLR could lead to a number of attacks. "All current operating systems supporting randomizations implement variants of ASLR for both user- and kernel-level address spaces. Kernel-level ASLR (KASLR) randomizes kernel code segments and can stop attacks that require knowledge of the kernel address space layout (including [return-oriented programming], jump-oriented programming, return-to-libc, ret-2-user and other attacks)," the researchers wrote. Andre Joseph, consultant at Cigital Inc., based in Dulles, Va., told SearchSecurity that being able to bypass ASLR is a very dangerous capability for an attacker to have. "It's an important defense-in-depth measure, since it makes it much harder for an attacker to leverage overflow attacks by randomizing the location of attacker code," Joseph said. "Once sufficiently randomized, the attacker will not know where to make the instruction pointer flow in order to execute their code." In addition to the Intel chip flaw potentially allowing an attacker to bypass ASLR on any platform, Felix Wilhelm, security researcher at ERNW Research, based in Germany, showed a proof-of-concept tool for leaking the base address of the KVM hypervisor kernel module from a guest virtual machine. However, Wilhelm noted a few restrictions to performing the attack in a virtualized environment, depending on the implementation. Joseph said multiple processors might provide the most difficulty in performing the attack. "It certainly seems easier to obtain the kernel ASLR bits instead of user-application ASLR bits. It becomes especially problematic for application ASLR if you have multiple cores," Joseph told SearchSecurity. "They pose methods of forcing the victim application onto the same core as the malicious process, but I'm not sure how reliable those methods would really be in practice. In order for the user-space ASLR exploit to work, you'd need both processes on the same processor, since each processor will have a different BTB." The researchers said software countermeasures would have limited efficacy "because they are not able to control how branches are mapped to the BTB entries, thus they do not address the root cause of the side channel." But they said finer-grained ASLR schemes or fuzzing the time-stamp counter could make the attack more difficult. However, the researchers concluded that changes to Intel processors would be far more effective. "A hardware solution that would fundamentally mitigate the BTB-based attacks is to change the BTB-addressing mechanism in a way that prevents exploitable collisions in the BTB. The attack against KASLR can be mitigated by using full virtual address for accessing the BTB, thus eliminating collisions between the user code and the kernel code." Intel did not respond to comment requests at the time of this post. Next Steps Learn more about an Android Stagefright exploit that can bypass ASLR.

Oil prices touched their highest point in a year thanks to news of growing supply, and that bounce helped push the United States Oil Fund ETF (NYSEMKT:USO) to a 2% gain. Meanwhile, VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSEMKT:GDX) rose by 3% thanks to an uptick in the price of gold as the U.S. dollar further weakened against major currencies. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Vasco (NASDAQ:VDSI) stocks made notable moves on Wednesday as investors reacted to updates from the companies on their latest growth trajectories. Intel's downbeat forecast Down 6%, Intel was the worst performer on the Dow despite announcing solid third-quarter results. The tech titan posted double-digit sales growth in its data center and Internet of Things divisions, which helped overall revenue jump 9% to $15.8 billion.  Image source: Getty Images. Earnings rose at a slightly slower pace as gross profitability slipped. Yet Intel still generated $0.69 in earnings per share, 8% higher than the prior-year period and just above management's September guidance. "We're executing well," CEO Brian Krzanich said in a press release, "and these results show Intel's continuing transformation to a company that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected devices." Investors looked past those healthy gains to focus on the relatively weak projections for the quarter ahead. Its sales growth guidance calls for a 5% improvement to $15.7 billion, while consensus estimates were hoping for closer to $15.9 billion. Profits are expected to decline, meanwhile, as Intel ramps up investments in the business including spending on factory costs for the new 10-nanometer node.   Neither of these challenges mean that Intel's growth plan is in danger. But they do highlight the fact that many of its markets, especially the consumer PC segment, aren't fully recovered yet. Vasco lowers its growth outlook Shares of digital security specialist Vasco dove by 16% following its preliminary third-quarter earnings report that showed a surprising slowdown in demand. Revenue will weigh in at $43 million this quarter, executives explained, as the company barely broke even with profits of $0.01 per share. These figures are below management's expectations and reflect weaker demand for its digital signature products in the European market. "Some of our large banking customers are adapting to market pressures and the need for digital transformation," CEO Kendall Hunt said in a press release. "As a result, they are delaying the placement of orders." Vasco believes these orders will eventually show up in future quarters, but it isn't projecting a quick rebound. In fact, executives scaled back their full-year sales guidance to $190 million from the $210 million they had last forecast. Earnings will take a hit from this decline as well, with operating income now seen coming in below the 11% that Vasco was targeting for the year.  Management promised more detail on profitability and operating trends when the company announces its full quarterly report on Oct. 27. Until then, investors will need to lower their expectations to account for Vasco's struggles in a European banking market that makes up the bulk of its business.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 19, 2016 at 5:23PM Image source: Intel.  After microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) reported its financial results for the third quarter of 2016 and offered a forecast for the fourth quarter, the company's shares dropped more than 5% in after-hours trading. Although Intel reported strong financial results (revenue for the quarter was better than guided, for example), the drop -- at least in the near term -- appears to be justified. Here's why. Guidance miss relative to expectations Intel's revised financial guidance for the quarter called for $15.6 billion in revenue -- representing the midpoint of the range that Intel provided -- thanks to an uptick in sales of chips that go into personal computers. Intel actually delivered $15.8 billion in revenue, handily beating the midpoint of its revised guidance and analyst consensus of $15.58 billion. So why is the stock taking a drubbing if it actually beat analyst estimates? The fourth-quarter guidance miss Analysts were expecting Intel to guide to revenue of around $15.86 billion for the fourth quarter of the year; Intel guided to $15.7 billion -- missing expectations, albeit slightly. Investors often place greater value on future performance and less on past performance, which is probably a large reason the stock is selling off. However, the problems run a little bit deeper than a headline guidance miss; there was a pretty significant red flag in the company's earnings report -- particularly in its results for its highly important data center group business. (If you're unfamiliar with why this segment is so important to Intel and its investors, read this.) The data center disappointment During the first half of the year, Intel's data center business delivered disappointing revenue growth relative to its long-term 15% compounded annual growth rate guidance and even its full-year guidance of low-double-digit percentage growth -- 9% in the first quarter and just 5% in the second quarter. Despite those lackluster results in the first half of 2016, Intel management insisted that it could still hit its double-digit growth target for the year as a result of a significant reacceleration during the second half of the year. Intel's data center group achieved just 10% year-over-year growth in the third quarter and, unsurprisingly, guided down full-year expectations to just "high-single-digit growth." Although the better-than-expected results in the company's personal computer chip business helped to bolster the quarterly results -- even the "worse than expected" fourth-quarter guidance still represents a healthy number -- investors are very sensitive to the performance of the company's data center group. Remember, Intel and many investors have basically written off hopes of ever seeing its PC business as a "growth" business again -- it's a large cash cow that's going to milked for every last dollar of operating profit that it can reasonably produce. The data center group, on the other hand, represents the company's best hope over the long term at sustainable growth, since the markets it serves are generally growing. If this shows signs of faltering, then Intel's growth prospects may appear dimmer -- leading to a lower share price. Should investors panic? Although the headline results might seem bad, things look better when one takes a look under the covers. The bulk of Intel's data center group revenue comes from the sale of processors, and according to the company's 2015 investor meeting, those processor sales can be broken down into three major categories: Enterprise server. Cloud server. High-performance computing, workstations, networking, and storage. Intel's prior forecast called for each of these segments to represent roughly a third of the processor revenue that its data center group generates in 2016. Image source: Intel.  According to Intel, although the second two categories performed well -- and they're generally viewed as the healthy and growing sub-segments of Intel's data center business -- the enterprise server portion of its business came in worse than expected. Intel says it was looking for enterprise-related revenue to be roughly flat, but it wound up declining about 3% in the quarter. The good news here is that the sub-segments that have historically been growing are still growing, so it's not as though these results cast doubt over the long-term trends that this business is expected to benefit from. It just so happens that one generally problematic and disappointing sub-segment was a little more problematic and disappointing than is usually the case. So although the data center results were disappointing, they're hardly cause to freak out over. If you liked Intel's long-term prospects before the earnings report, then this one "miss" really shouldn't change that fundamental view. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

It’s a versatile hardware connector that combines high-speed data transfers with audio and video display. First launched in 2011, with the development name Light Peak, Thunderbolt was invested by a partnership of tech luminaries, including Intel, Apple, LaCie and others. The first iteration of the technology debuted on the 2011 Apple MacBook Pro with other Thunderbolt-equipped models following. On the PC side, manufacturers were reasonably slow to adopt Thunderbolt (preferring the lower cost USB 3.0) despite heavy championing by Intel.  The Thunderbolt 2 (Falcon Ridge) standard arrived in 2013, doubling data transfer speeds to 20 Gbps and the connector began to pop up on motherboards from ASUS, Gigabyte and ASRock, alongside PCs from Dell, HP, Lenovo and others. According to Intel, at the end of 2015, over 100 million computers are equipped with the Thunderbolt interface, with more than 250 peripherals on the market. Here we are in early 2016, and Thunderbolt 3 (Alpine Ridge) is ready to roll! The latest version of the standard brings a big physical change in the switch the USB-C connector (any USB Type-C cable will work in a Thunderbolt 3 port but you’ll need a Thunderbolt cable to connect to a Thunderbolt 3 device). Speeds are doubled to 40 Gbps, and Intel boasts that you’ll be able to drive dual 4K displays at 60 Hz. With the switch to USB-C (as an Alternate Mode), Thunderbolt 3 ports are power enabled, offering up to 100W charging power for notebooks and 15W to bus-powered devices. Thunderbolt cables are now more versatile than ever, supporting a range of protocols including Thunderbolt itself, DisplayPort, USB and PCI Express. Update (October 2016): With Apple announcing a new range of MacBook Pro laptops supporting Thunderbolt 3, we’ve taken the opportunity to refresh this list with another ten great Thunderbolt 3 products to check out. Twenty for the price of ten? Sounds like a great deal! Apple MacBook Pro (2016) While the likes of Acer, Dell and HP have already launched products supporting Thunderbolt 3, it’s the launch of the new Apple MacBook Pro that will drive the technology into mainstream use. The guys from Cupertino have announced 13 and 15″ editions of the 2016 MacBook Pro, all of which rock Thunderbolt 3 ports. The entry level 13″ MacBook Pro is priced at $1,499 and is powered by a 2 GHz Intel Core i5 Skylake processor, partnered with 8 GB RAM. Two Thunderbolt 3 ports are equipped, supporting 40 Gbps data transfers, two 5K displays and accessory charging. While the base model lacks Apple’s new Touch Bar and Touch ID features, you’ll find them included further up the range, which extends all the way to the $2,799 15″ MacBook Pro. It offers four Thunderbolt 3 ports, 16 GB RAM, an Intel Core i7 Skylake CPU, discreet AMD Radeon Pro 455 with 2GB memory and more. Of course, you’re welcome to spec the MacBook Pro with even more advanced features should your wallet allow! The world’s best laptop? Let the debate rage on! Apple Thunderbolt 3 & USB-C Cables Shell out all that hard earned cash on a new MacBook Pro and, of course, you’ll expect all the cables and adapters you need will be included in the box, right? Well, think again. With Cupertino desperate to prop up declining iPad sales, it looks as if the company is driving margins hard by encouraging Mac enthusiasts to plump for a range of reasonably pricey connectors for the new dream machines. The $49 Apple Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter allows you to connect any of your existing Thunderbolt 2 devices to the MacBook Pro’s Thunderbolt 3 USB-C port. It’s a bidirectional adapter, so it can also connect new Thunderbolt 3 devices to a Mac with a Thunderbolt or Thunderbolt 2 port (but you’ll need MacOS Sierra or later on board).   Other cables that you’ll need to check out are the $19 USB-C Charging Cable, $25 1m USB-C to Lightning Cable (for iPhone and iPad users), $19 USB-C to USB Adapter, Belkin’s $34.95 USB-C to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter and the $69 USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter which includes a HDMI connection, a standard USB port and a USB-C charging port. There are, of course, third-party versions of some of these adapters and cables available at cheaper prices. Be sure to check out the reviews of these before purchasing and, if possible, stick to brands you know. New MacBook owners should definitely check out our guide to this year’s Essential USB 3.1 Gen 2 products too. ASUS ThunderboltEX 3 Expansion Card for Z170 & X99 Motherboards Switching to the Windows desktop world now, owners of newer Z170 and X99 motherboards will want to check out the new ASUS ThunderboltEX 3 Expansion Card, which provides a reasonably quick and easy way to upgrade desktop PCs with Thunderbolt 3 support. The $69 PCIe card slots into the motherboard, adding one USB Type-C port supporting Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2 connections, Mini DP In, plus a secondary USB 3.1 Type-A port. The card supports USB Power Delivery specs for up to 36W charging and upgrades data transfer speeds to 40 Gbps. Akitio Thunder3 PCIe Expansion Box The Akitio Thunder3 PCIe Box is an expansion chassis that provides an additional PCIe slot for Thunderbolt 3 computers. It’s a great solution for scenarios where installing an internal expansion card is not an option or for desktop systems where there is not enough space for additional PCIe cards. Connecting via USB-C, the onboard Thunderbolt 3 interface supports two additional USB-C ports, a dedicated DisplayPort for hooking up an additional monitor, plus a second Thunderbolt port supporting Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1, and DisplayPort devices. Clad in aluminium, the Thunder3 allows you to daisy-chain up to 6 Thunderbolt devices The Thunder3’s PCIe (x16) slot supports half-length, full-height, double-width cards with a 4 lane PCI Express 3.0 compliant interface. It’s priced at $299 and available now. HP Spectre X360   If you’re seeking a Windows laptop to give the Apple MacBook Pro a run for its money, the HP Spectre X360 may fit the bill. It’s a convertible 2-in-1 laptop, available in 13 and 15″ sizes. It’s powered by the latest Intel “Kaby Lake” processor and is just 13.8mm (0.54 inches) at its thickest point. A pair of USB-C ports support Thunderbolt 3 connections, while an integrated infra-red camera enables Windows Hello biometric authentication. Simply look at the screen, and the Spectre X360 unlocks. The new HP Spectre x360 is available to order now, priced from $1,049.99. Cable Matters USB-C to HDMI / VGA / Ethernet / USB Multiport 4K UHD Adapter   Adopting new technology can see the costs rack up, so it’s good to know there are some good value Thunderbolt 3 compatible accessories available that won’t break the bank. The Cable Matters USB-C to HDMI / VGA / Ethernet / USB Multiport 4K UHD Adapter is one of them. Fully compatible with Thunderbolt 3, the $45 adapter supports multiple connections, including Gigabit Ethernet, USB 3.0, and an HDMI or VGA video port over a single USB-C connection. 4K UHD (3840×2160 @ 30Hz) display over HDMI is available, while you can also connect a flash drive, mouse, or a smartphone for data transfers and syncing. It’s not the prettiest, but versatile it most certainly is. StarTech.com Thunderbolt 3 Dual-4K Docking Station for Laptops StarTech’s $185 Thunderbolt 3 docking station is a sleek accessory for Windows PCs, allowing connection of your laptop to dual-4K displays (60Hz) & multiple peripherals at speeds up to 40Gbps, with a single cable. Sadly, there’s no support for Macs, but Windows users can connect dual UHD displays or a single 5K 60 Hz displays should they wish. The dock features two Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, as well as DisplayPort video output. For dual 4K video capability, you can use a 4K 60Hz capable video adapter to connect a second 4K 60Hz display to one of the dock’s Thunderbolt 3 USB-C peripheral ports, the company says. USB fast-charge and sync is supported (compliant with USB Battery Charging Specification 1.2) while you’ll also find an additional USB-C port (5Gbps – data only), and a Gigabit Ethernet port. Intel NUC NUC6i7KYK Mini PC Scoring eleven on the ten point awesomeness scale for mini PCs is the latest Intel NUC, the NUC6i7KYK. Small but mighty, this NUC is powered by a 6th generation Skylake Intel Core i7 processor and Intel Iris Pro Graphics. Its Thunderbolt 3 interface supports up to three 4K displays and allows you to further accelerate graphics performance with external graphics cards and transfer data to and from an external drive at 40 Gbps. As will all NUC’s you’ll need to add your own storage, RAM and OS, but the results are impressive. The base price for the kit is just under $600, while you’ll need to add $300+ for additional components.  A tiny, full-powered gaming rig or video workstation – truly innovative. Belkin USB-IF Certified 3-Foot USB-C to USB-C (Type C to Type C) Thunderbolt 3 Cable While Apple-fans may be happier checking out the white Belkin Thunderbolt 3 cable I highlighted earlier, everyone else will be please to see that the company has also manufactured a black cable which will match a wider range of kit. Their 3 foot USB-C cable is USB-IF certified, but remains pricey at $29.99. It supports 4K/Ultra HD display connections and is rated for 20 Gbps data transfers, with the bonus of powering a laptop with up to 60W of charging power. Kanex USB-C to SD Card Reader With integrated SD card readers seemingly going the way of the dodo (or in Apple’s case, the 3.5mm headphone jack) photography enthusiasts are going to need a solution to transfer their artistry from camera to PC. Sure, Wi-Fi is an increasingly attractive option for those cameras and SD cards that support it. However, for large RAW files and video, an SD card reader remains a strong option. The Kanex USB-C to SD Card Reader is available in Space Gray (MacBook Pro owners, take note) and supports a wide range of storage cards, including Micro SD/T-Flash, SD, mini SD, MMC, MMC Plus, RS-MMC, MMC Mobile, MS, MS Pro, MS Duo, and MS Pro Duo. It’s compatible with Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, but will only transfer data at 5 Gbps (still plenty fast). Priced less than $15, the Kanex USB-C to SD Card Reader is a great value addition to your backpack.     Razer Blade Stealth & Razer Core If you’re a gamer, you’ll know all about Razer, Inc. Their newly announced Razer Blade Stealth is a beautiful and powerful 12.5″ ultrabook that can hook up to the external Razer Core enclosure over Thunderbolt 3. That brings you desktop class graphics (you can plug in full-length, double-wide PCIe desktop graphics cards) and a host of additional connections including 4 USB 3.0 ports and Gigabit Ethernet. Work or play, it’s got the lot.The Razor Blade Stealth starts at $999, pricing for the Razer Core is yet to be announced. AKiTiO Thunder3 Duo Pro With super-fast data transfer speeds, expect to see a wide range of Thunderbolt 3 storage solutions coming down the line this year. The $389 Thunder3 Duo Pro from AKiTiO is one of the first, boasting transfer speeds up to 770 MB/s while simultaneously providing two 4K video streams to connected displays. That’s 8x faster than USB 3.1 Gen 1 and 4x faster than USB 3.1 Gen 2. It’s a dual-bay RAID enclosure, offering RAID 0 striping, RAID 1 mirroring, SPAN, and Non-RAID. Connectivity is strong, with two Thunderbolt 3 Ports, a USB 3.1 Gen 1 (Type-B) port, and a DisplayPort video output for 4K 60HZ displays. The second Thunderbolt 3 port on the Thunder3 Duo Pro supports Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 (10Gb/s), and DisplayPort devices. It’s coming in the first quarter of the year. Dell Thunderbolt Dock PC manufacturers are waking up to the fact that the concept of “mobile” and “fixed” workers is outdated. Nowadays, many of us working in a hybrid style. We may be travelling, but when we touch down to get some work done, many of us need the same capabilities and connectivity as we’d expect at our own desk. Devices like the Dell Thunderbolt Dock seek to address that need. Plug into your notebook and you get benefit from a single data and power source that can drive can drive up to three 1080p displays or two 4K displays at 60 Hz. Add twin USB 2.0 ports and three USB 3.0, VGA, mini DisplayPort, and HDMI sockets, plus DisplayPort and a Thunderbolt 3 port in addition. Best of all, as it adheres to industry standards, it’s not just for Dell notebooks – everyone’s invited. The Dell Thunderbolt Dock ships this month for $299. HP ZBook Dock With Thunderbolt 3 Following a similar theme as the Dell Thunderbolt Dock, in a less chunky (but longer) form factor, the HP ZBook Dock With Thunderbolt 3 also costs $299 and offers a similarly impressive array of connections. Alongside charging capabilities, you can hook up to 10 devices at once through ports that include Thunderbolt 3 (which also supports DisplayPort 1.2 and USB 3.1 Gen 2), four USB 3.0, RJ-45, VGA, combo audio, and two additional DisplayPorts. ASUS ROG XG Station 2 It’s common for bleeding edge tech to land first on gaming rigs and that’s certainly true for Thunderbolt 3. The ASUS ROG XG Station 2 is an external graphics card docking station and although ASUS says it’s “specifically designed for ASUS laptops and graphics cards”, we’re still waiting to hear whether other brands will be locked out. Plug in your laptop (using its USB-C port) and the dock will both charge your laptop and supercharge its graphics capabilities. You’ll need to bring your own graphics card to slot into the XG Station 2 and ASUS has yet to reveal compatibility details and pricing. Acer TravelMate P648 Notebook If you’re in the hunt for a high-tech travel companion, the 14″ Acer TravelMate P648 Notebook is powered by a 6th generation Intel Core processor with support for super-high speed 802.11ad multi-band wireless connectivity. You’ll need a compatible router though, like the newly announced TP-LINK Talon AD7200, which offers combined speeds up to 7200 Mbps. 4 GB RAM supports the processor, upgradable to a massive 20 GB and there’s ample storage space with up to 1 TB hard drives or 512 GB solid state drives. Graphics are handled by NVIDIA GeForce 840M discrete graphics. Thunderbolt 3 support offers ultra-fast data transfer and 4K display connectivity while eight hours of battery life should keep you occupied for the day. The Acer TravelMate P648 Notebook starts at $799.99 and ships in April. Plugable Flagship Thunderbolt 3 Dock  Plugable’s new Flagship Thunderbolt 3 Dock is designed to eliminate the need to continually plug and unplug devices from your notebook or tablet. You can hook up two uncompressed 4K 60Hz (4096 x 2160) displays, three USB 3.0 devices, Gigabit Ethernet, and Stereo audio in/out while keeping your desktop free of clutter. The second Thunderbolt 3 port on the dock operates the same as a Thunderbolt 3 computer port by supporting Thunderbolt 3 (up to 5 daisy chained), USB 3.1 (10Gb/s), and DisplayPort devices. It’ll arrive in Q1 2016.   Plugable Thunderbolt 3 Dual-Display Adapter Meanwhile, the Plugable Thunderbolt 3 Dual-Display Adapter offers a quick and convenient way to hook up multiple displays to your PC. Two versions of the adapters are hitting the market this year. A DisplayPort variant supports the connection of two uncompressed 4K 60Hz (4096 x 2160) monitors. A second, HDMI model offers support for two uncompressed 4K 30Hz (3840 x 2160) monitors. Both are coming in Q1 2016.   Startech.com Thunderbolt 3 to Dual DP Adapter/HDMI Adapter Peripheral and accessory specialist Startech.com is introducing Thunderbolt 3 to Dual DisplayPort Adapter, which they’re calling “the highest resolution and simplest dual DisplayPort adapter ever”. Why? Well, it’s bus powered, does not require additional device drivers, and, for the first time, a dual DisplayPort adapter supports two full uncompressed DisplayPort 1.2 video streams from a single Thunderbolt 3 port (that’s nearly 16 million more pixels than an HDTV, from a single Thunderbolt 3 port).   A similar adapter, supporting Thunderbolt 3 to twin HDMI connections, rather than DisplayPort is also available, priced at $91.95. Startech.com Thunderbolt 3 Cables If you like the look of all these Thundrbolt 3 solutions, you’re going to need some cables to go with them. >Startech.com are shipping Thunderbolt 3 cables with USB-C connectors in lengths of 0.5m ($25.99), 1m ($29.99) and 2m ($35.99). Bear in mind, though, that the fastest 40 Gbps connections are only available with the 0.5m cable. Longer lengths result in a speed drop to (a still blistering) 20 Gbps. While we’ve seen a swathe of new Thunderbolt 3 products unveiled at CES 2016, we can expect to see many more announced through the year. Thunderbolt may have had a slow start, but with compatible notebooks, gaming rigs, storage devices and accessories now streaming into the market, it looks like the versatile Thunderbolt 3 standard will be popping up everywhere this year. shares Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Reddit Email Subscribe Join the mailing list Sign up to our mailing list and you will receive the latest news, reviews and how to guides delivered directly to your inbox.

Joe Pleniukas I’m curious – has anyone seen an adapter to go from Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2? Some of these docks have display port slots, but it doesn’t seem like you’d be able to use Thunderbolt 2 peripherals on a machine equipped with Thunderbolt 3 in the usb-c form factor unless I’m mistaken. Terry Walsh Hi Joe – looks like Startech.com has one, but it’s pricey: http://www.startech.com/ca/Cables/thunderbolt-3-cables/thunderbolt-3-usb-c-thunderbolt-adapter~TBT3TBTADAP phatkatmeow apple just released a couple of adapters, including t3->t2/t1 Shawn Lopez Is it going to be possible to run a display above 60Hz? I am looking to push a single monitor at 3440x1440p at 100Hz but all I see in these docks, hubs and adapters is 4k @60Hz. 3440x1440p is equivalent of 2.5k and typically when there is a refresh rate limitation it is due to the bandwidth limitation of the interface. According to https://thunderbolttechnology.net/tech/faq They say that Thunderbolt 3 is based on the DisplayPort 1.2 specification and can support up to 2 streams (eight lanes) of DisplayPort 1.2 video bandwidth. A single cable now provides four times the data and twice the video bandwidth of any other cable, while also supplying up to 100W of power.

It had a higher percentage of Amazon one-star ratings than I’ve ever seen. Terry, you should put a disclaimer on you site about the Dell dock before you get served yourself.

It’s a versatile hardware connector that combines high-speed data transfers with audio and video display. First launched in 2011, with the development name Light Peak, Thunderbolt was invested by a partnership of tech luminaries, including Intel, Apple, LaCie and others. The first iteration of the technology debuted on the 2011 Apple MacBook Pro with other Thunderbolt-equipped models following. On the PC side, manufacturers were reasonably slow to adopt Thunderbolt (preferring the lower cost USB 3.0) despite heavy championing by Intel.  The Thunderbolt 2 (Falcon Ridge) standard arrived in 2013, doubling data transfer speeds to 20 Gbps and the connector began to pop up on motherboards from ASUS, Gigabyte and ASRock, alongside PCs from Dell, HP, Lenovo and others. According to Intel, at the end of 2015, over 100 million computers are equipped with the Thunderbolt interface, with more than 250 peripherals on the market. Here we are in early 2016, and Thunderbolt 3 (Apline Ridge) is ready to roll! The latest version of the standard brings a big physical change in the switch the USB-C connector (any USB Type-C cable will work in a Thunderbolt 3 port but you’ll need a Thunderbolt cable to connect to a Thunderbolt 3 device). Speeds are doubled to 40 Gbps, and Intel boasts that you’ll be able to drive dual 4K displays at 60 Hz. With the switch to USB-C (as an Alternate Mode), Thunderbolt 3 ports are power enabled, offering up to 100W charging power for notebooks and 15W to bus-powered devices. Thunderbolt cables are now more versatile than ever, supporting a range of protocols including Thunderbolt itself, DisplayPort, USB and PCI Express. With a wide range of Thunderbolt 3 enabled products on show at CES 2016 in Las Vegas, here are ten that we’re most excited about checking out this year. Razer Blade Stealth & Razer Core If you’re a gamer, you’ll know all about Razer, Inc. Their newly announced Razer Blade Stealth is a beautiful and powerful 12.5″ ultrabook that can hook up to the external Razer Core enclosure over Thunderbolt 3. That brings you desktop class graphics (you can plug in full-length, double-wide PCIe desktop graphics cards) and a host of additional connections including 4 USB 3.0 ports and Gigabit Ethernet.

Connectivity is strong, with two Thunderbolt 3 Ports, a USB 3.1 Gen 1 (Type-B) port, and a DisplayPort video output for 4K 60HZ displays.

 Intel's Diane Bryant told a hilarious story about learning to swear at work Julie Bort Oct. 19, 2016, 2:58 PM 4,965 facebook linkedin twitter email print Diane Bryant, Intel's executive vice president and general manager of the Data Center Group. Intel Intel's executive vice president Diane Bryant runs the company's fastest-growing, most profitable business unit, Data Center, which brought in more than $18 billion last year. Her rise in the company was a long road. She landed at Intel straight from college, and has spent her whole 31-year career with the chipmaker. When she started at Intel, in 1985, she was a young woman in a man's world, and they weren't thrilled to have her. "I was truly a minority as a woman inside the tech industry and it was a very rough and tumble era," Bryant said at Fortune's Most Powerful Women Summit on Wednesday. "I had to play like the boys," she says. "It doesn't help to be in the outer circle. You are never going to have impact from the outside. Somehow you have to get to the inside. And as a minority, you need to be willing to admit: I'm a minority. I need to change the way I act and operate, if I'm going to get to the inside and I'm going to have an impact." She adds, "To those who say that's being a sell-out, or you are not being who you are, I say, it's better to be in the game than sitting on the bench."  She needed to un-clean-up her language. "The first thing I did was I started swearing a lot. A lot," she told the audience, who roared with laughter. "And I'm not kidding. The worst experience, I'm a junior engineer, sitting in a conference with all older men, all white men, and this one guy throws out the f-word and then stops and turns to me, so all eyes are on me, 23 years old, and says, 'Oh, I'm sorry.' And I said, 'No, f*&ing problem.'" The audience laughed again. "And then I would throw out the f-word every now and then, just randomly. And it was hard. I actually had to concentrate, like, 'Swear now! Now! Swear now!" I actually had to concentrate, like, 'Swear now! Now! Swear now! She said she also learned to drink Scotch, neat, and she bought a stick-shift BMW, "Because engineers like BMWs and no one drives and automatic." She only drew the line in one area: "I wouldn't do the bad haircut, the $10 engineering haircut, I wouldn't go that far." An inspiring rags-to-riches story Learning to swear was hardly the toughest thing she had to endure by age 23. As we previously reported, Bryant has one of the most amazing rags to riches stories we've ever heard, and she told her personal story again on stage. Diane Bryant Business Insider Born in Sacramento, she found herself kicked out of her home and homeless on her 18th birthday with four months left to graduate high school. She described her dad, in her usual cheerful tone, as a "convicted felon" who made it clear to his children that his "legal obligation was done the day they turned 18," and promptly kicked her and her sister out on their birthdays. She couch-surfed, stayed in high school, graduated then went to community college, which was free in California in those days.  She was sitting in a math class, when a guy asked her what her major was. She hadn't declared one, and he told her, "You should become an engineer. It's the highest starting salary you can get with a four-year degree." She immediately went to the school counselor and declared her major as engineering. When asked her if she would study software engineering or hardware, she chose software, since she thought "soft" sounded easier than "hard." She later changed it to hardware to qualify for scholarships.

However, gains, especially on the Nasdaq, were limited by Intel. The chipmaker tumbled 6 percent, weighing the most on major indexes, after its disappointing revenue forecast. The chip index dipped 0.54 percent. U.S. crude prices surged 3 percent to a 15-month high after a report showed an unexpected drop in U.S. crude stockpiles. The energy sector jumped 1.74 percent, the most in three weeks, also boosted by a 4.8 percent rise in Halliburton following its surprise quarterly profit. Morgan Stanley inched up 0.8 percent after its results. The financial sector has gained 1.8 percent in the past four trading days as the banks reported, while the KBW bank index is up nearly 3 percent. Now, about 80 percent of the 70 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have beaten earnings' expectations, increasing the likelihood of snapping a four-quarter earnings recession. Analysts now estimate earnings increased 0.5 percent in the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "We would see the third quarter as the bottoming out of the earnings recession that we have been experiencing for the last year or so," said Tracy Maeter, global investment specialist, J.P. Morgan Private Bank in Philadelphia. At 12:27 p.m. ET (1627 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 74.79 points, or 0.41 percent, at 18,236.73. The S&P 500 was up 6.16 points, or 0.29 percent, at 2,145.76 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 2.25 points, or 0.04 percent, at 5,246.08. Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher. The consumer staples' 0.7 percent drop was the steepest. The Federal Reserve is due to release its Beige Book at about 2:00 p.m. ET, giving anecdotal commentary on the health of the U.S. economy. The third and final U.S. presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton starts later in the day. The stock market had gained on both days after the previous two debates, which were perceived to be won by Clinton. "The noise in the marketplace around politics can drive stocks in the short term, but in terms of the underlying influence ... that's going to be driven more by the economy and the profitability of companies," Maeter said. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,178 to 721. On the Nasdaq, 1,637 issues rose and 1,008 fell. The S&P 500 index showed eight new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 45 new highs and 44 new lows.

Many more configurations will be available, including a 3 node VxRail offering that drops the entry price by a quarter. Gil Shneorson, VP & GM of VxRail Appliances at Dell EMC AUSTIN – At Dell EMC World, Dell EMC has announced the expansion of its hyper-converged portfolio with new VxRail Appliances and VxRack Systems configurations. The upgrades here are purely on the hardware side, as the software received a substantial boost earlier this year with VSAN 6.2. The two significant enhancements now are the addition of the latest Intel Broadwell processors, and their integration with Dell EMC PowerEdge servers. Just as important however, is the positioning. The new offerings significantly expand the total addressable market – both upward and downward, due to the new processor capabilities on the one hand, and a significantly lower entry price on the other. They also give primacy to VxRail appliances in the VMware market – which of course is at present, most of the market. The successful XC series, based on the earlier Dell partnership with Nutanix, will now be limited by Dell EMC specifically to that smaller part of the market where Microsoft, and Nutanix’s own Acropolis hypervisor play. This inevitably will invite conjecture about the future of the Dell-Nutanix relationship. VxRail was introduced by EMC in early 2016, replacing the VSPEX Blue, which had had a short, unhappy lifespan. “We had a lot of constraints built in to the way we brought the VSPEX Blue to market,” said Gil Shneorson, VP & GM of VxRail Appliances at Dell EMC. “We were new with it, and there was a learning period to this first product. When we brought in VxRail, the market could not have responded better. We oversold our sales plan by a significant amount in Q1, Q2 and Q3, with thousands of nodes sold and hundreds of net new customers. Within a few months we even ran out of inventory, a problem that is now well behind us.” So what accounts for the changed fortune of the two products? “With VxRail, we finally understood what we were selling – a product optimized for the VMware user – which no other product is,” Shneorson said. “At the same time, it has all the other hyper-converged advantages, like the ability to start small and grow easily with the customer.” VXRail then, now becomes Dell EMC’s formal ‘go to’ product for the VMware space. Shneorson, however, said that does not herald any diminishing of their relationship with Nutanix. Perish the thought! “We will not walk away from commitments,” he said. “Our XC customers will continue to be served. VxRail will not be an answer for someone that wants Microsoft HyperV, or another product. For that gap, we will have XC. From a Dell EMC perspective, we see growth in all of those areas, as the other areas besides VMware are growing as well. Ultimately, everyone will grow. It’s almost a limitless opportunity.” It would be hazardous to draw conclusions about the Dell-Nutanix relationship from this development, even as Dell EMC appears to walk a fine line between maintaining a commitment to Nutanix, and kicking them to the curb because of the conflict with the solutions acquired from EMC. Nutanix of course is no stranger to the same game. They have solemnly invoked their commitment to working with VMware, even as they were introducing a free alternative with their Acropolis hypervisor to stop the “VM Tax.” More recently, they unveiled a clever marketing campaign during VMworld offering themselves as an alternative to legacy players VMware and AWS. Certainly the new VxRail products are much more capable than their predecessors. “We are not just taking the PowerEdge servers and attaching them to the product,” Shneorson said. “We have expedited some of the plans we thought we would take two years into two months, and brought them together in ways that are very powerful. Supply chains and support organizations are hard to converge, and these will go out in a way that get the benefit of both.” More specific use cases can also be addressed. “We are introducing both a storage heavy highly dense node model for Big Data Analytics and Microsoft Exchange, based on the PowerEdge R730xd platform,” Shneorson said. “We are introducing a graphics-heavy offering for client virtualization workloads with GPU acceleration from NVIDIA and AMD. We have also got to a three node offering for the first time with this release, which we have wanted for some time, as it is ideal for the ROBO market. This reduces the overall starting point to about $45,000 from $60,000 — so we are going downmarket as well as upmarket.” New configurations of VxRail Appliances with VMware Horizon specifically optimized for client virtualization will also be available. The upmarket momentum comes from the new Intel Broadwell processors, with better price performance, more capacity and more CPU. VxRail Appliances with PowerEdge servers now offer 40 per cent more CPU performance for the same price, and two times more storage in all flash nodes. The hardware enhancements bring similar improvement to the VxRack System 1000, a rack-scale hyper-converged system with integrated top-of-rack Spine-Leaf networking and SDN options. A VxRack System 1000 with PowerEdge servers now offers 2.5x more flash capacity, and 40 per cent more CPU performance for the same price. “The VxRack is for customers who plan for scale in the first place and are willing to invest in infrastructure,” Schneorson said. “The better supply chain and hardware benefits give us much more to work with. Shneorson also pointed out that the channel will bring home the lion’s share of business from these enhancements. Under EMC, these products went 90 per cent through partners, significantly higher than the partner share of EMC business as a whole. VxRack FLEX with PowerEdge-based nodes can be ordered now and will be available in Q4 2016. VxRack SDDC with PowerEdge-based nodes with integrated PowerEdge servers will be orderable in Q4 2016. VxRail Appliances integrated with PowerEdge servers are orderable and generally available in Q4 2016 in most major markets and generally available worldwide in 2017. VxRail Appliances based on PowerEdge servers with VMware Horizon for client virtualization will be available in December 2016.

Reply Kevin Dsouza October 20, 2016 at 10:29 am I dont think Dell EMC will catch up with Nutanix, especially since Vmware is auditing its own customers to get more business, that’s a sign of losers.

Intel tumbled nearly 6 per cent and was the biggest drag on all three indexes, after the chipmaker’s disappointing current-quarter revenue forecast. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index dipped 0.8 per cent. Oil prices surged more than 2 per cent after a report showed an unexpected drop in US crude stockpiles. The energy sector jumped 1.64 per cent, the most in three weeks, also boosted by a 5.2 per cent rise in Halliburton following its surprise quarterly profit. Morgan Stanley inched up 0.2 per cent after its results rounded off a strong quarter for big US banks. The financial sector has gained 1 per cent since Thursday, a day before the banks started reporting, while the KBW bank index is up 2.1 per cent. Through yesterday, earnings from S&P 500 companies had largely beaten market expectations, putting them on track to post profit growth for the first time in five quarters. Analysts now estimate earnings increased 0.2 per cent in the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “We would see the third quarter as the bottoming out of the earnings recession that we have been experiencing for the last year or so,” said Tracy Maeter, global investment specialist, J.P. Morgan Private Bank in Philadelphia. “But it’s likely to be a little bit noisy with a lot of dispersion across the sectors.” At 11:00am ET (1500 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 76.12 points, or 0.42 per cent, at 18,238.06. The S&P 500 was up 6.62 points, or 0.31 per cent, at 2,146.22 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.83 points, or 0.07 per cent, at 5,247.67. Five of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the consumer staples’ 0.6 per cent drop the steepest. The Federal Reserve is due to release its Beige Book about 2pm ET, giving anecdotal commentary on the health of the US economy. The third and final US presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton starts later in the evening.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: U.S. stocks notched a second straight day of gains on Wednesday, as climbing oil prices lifted the energy sector and earnings from Morgan Stanley provided a boost to financials. Brent crude settled up 1.9 percent and U.S. crude settled up 2.6 percent after touching a 15-month high following a government report that showed a sharp drop in domestic inventories for the sixth week in seven. The energy sector rose 1.4 percent, its biggest gain in seven sessions. A 4.2-percent rise in Halliburton also provided a boost after the world's No.2 oilfield services provider posted third-quarter results. Morgan Stanley gained 1.9 percent after posting a better-than-expected quarterly profit to round out a string of solid results from big U.S. banks. The financial sector has risen in three of the past four sessions for a 1.7 percent advance. "We’re up because the (earnings) numbers are so great, the forward guidance is great and the banks just knocked it out of the park," said Ken Polcari, Director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York. "In the end, this quarter of earnings will not be negative, they will be slightly positive after it is all said and done." A disappointing revenue forecast from Intel capped the advance on Wall Street, however. The chipmaker tumbled 5.9 percent as the biggest drag on each of the three major indexes. The PHLX semiconductor index shed 0.45 percent. With 70 companies in the S&P 500 having reported earnings through Wednesday morning, 80 percent have topped earnings' expectations. Third quarter earnings are now expected to increase 0.5 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, which would be the first quarter of growth in five. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 40.68 points, or 0.22 percent, to 18,202.62, the S&P 500 gained 4.69 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,144.29 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.58 points, or 0.05 percent, to 5,246.41. The U.S. economy showed some signs of rising wage pressures in September and early October but overall compensation growth remained modest, the Federal Reserve said in its Beige Book report. The third and final U.S. presidential debate between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton is set to begin on Wednesday at 9 p.m. EDT (0100 GMT Thursday). Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.40-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.52-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 10 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 62 new highs and 56 new lows. About 5.97 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 6.45 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Treasuries fell. American equities gained as Morgan Stanley reported better-than-estimated results, outweighing a disappointing forecast from Intel Corp. Oil extended gains in New York after the Energy Information Administration reported that US crude inventories fell last week. Treasuries dropped as investors focused on the prospects of an interest-rate increase in December, while awaiting the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book. The earnings season is picking up pace amid a mood of political and economic uncertainty, with the next Fed meeting and the presidential election just three weeks away. Ahead of the third and final presidential debate tonight, a Bloomberg Politics national poll showed a nine-point lead for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over Republican Donald Trump. With investors seeking clues on the trajectory of US rates, they will watch closely the central bank’s survey of regional conditions this afternoon. “The Fed is likely to raise rates in December and I don’t think that will happen sooner than that,” said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities Inc. in Los Angeles. “As you continue to get results the next two weeks, it’s going to be an accumulation. For the most part, the bigger financials with Goldman yesterday, Morgan Stanley today, and BofA earlier in the week — all of them posting pretty respectable numbers.” Stocks The S&P 500 Index rose 0.2 per cent to 2,142.93 as of 10:38am in New York, after rising the most in two weeks yesterday. Morgan Stanley added 1.5 per cent after joining a parade of banks whose profits were bolstered by bond-trading revenue. Intel slid 4.9 per cent. Halliburton Co. rose after posting a surprise profit. “We did get a number of earnings so that will continue to be the focus,” said Yousef Abbasi, a global market strategist at JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC. “Maybe we could have some momentum behind financials today. It has been a market that has lacked leadership to a certain extent, so we’re looking to financials and energy.” European stocks were little changed after their biggest gain in a month, with earnings reports taking a back seat as investors await tomorrow’s European Central Bank meeting for possible updates on the direction of monetary policy. Shares of developing nations posted the biggest back-to-back gain in about four weeks after data showed China’s economy is stabilising. Commodities West Texas Intermediate for November delivery rose US$1.21 to US$51.50 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent for December settlement climbed US$1.14 to US$52.82 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe Exchange. The EIA reported a 5.25 million-barrel decline in nationwide crude supplies in the week ended October 14. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast a 2.1 million-barrel increase and the American Petroleum Institute was said to report yesterday a 3.8 million-barrel drop. In Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for US futures contracts, stockpiles fell 1.64 million barrels. Opec can continue to stabilise the market and other nations have given “strong signals” they will cooperate, Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Energy and Industry Khalid Al-Falih said in London. “Any indication of a deal will add fuel to the bulls’ fire,” Tamas Varga, an analyst at PVM Oil Associates, said by phone. “I don’t think it is going to last for a long time, but at the moment the trend is up.” Gold and silver advanced amid a decline in the dollar. Currencies The dollar fell for a third day against its peers after a core US inflation gauge rose less than forecast in September, suggesting the pace of interest-rate increases by the Fed will be gradual. The US currency dropped against most of its 16 major counterparts this week as the chances of a hike by December, according to fed fund futures pricing, receded amid mixed signals from the world’s largest economy. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which measures the US currency against 10 major counterparts, dropped 0.1 per cent. It reached the highest level since March last week. The dollar was little changed at US$1.0969 per euro and weakened 0.4 per cent to 103.45 yen. “When we start breaking these levels it’s natural to see a bit of a pause,” said Gavin Friend, a strategist at National Australia Bank Ltd. in London, referring to the seven-month high in the Bloomberg gauge. “It’s even more natural if you take the view that the Fed is signaling it wants to go in December, but there are members of the Fed that mean we actually can’t be sure of that.” Elsewhere in the world, the ruble climbed as gains in the price of oil eclipsed investor concern the nation may face new sanctions over its role in Syria. China’s yuan halted this year’s longest run of losses. Brazil’s real gained even as policy makers are forecast to cut interest rates for the first time since 2012. Bonds Ten-year Treasury yields rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.75 per cent, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The yields slumped six basis points over the previous two days amid speculation that the Fed will tighten monetary policy at a gradual pace amid uneven growth in the world’s largest economy. “The December hike is still very much on the agenda,” said Jan von Gerich, chief strategist at Nordea Bank AB in Helsinki. “Small downward surprises at this point probably mean they’ll proceed even more carefully longer out, but I think they’re quite keen on a December hike.” Saudi Arabia plans to raise US$17.5 billion (RM73.7 billion) in the biggest ever bond sale from an emerging-market nation, according to four people with knowledge of the offering, as it seeks to shore up finances battered by the slide in oil. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Ananda mulls taking Astro private, report claims Bank Negara instructs foreign banks to refrain from offshore ringgit trading, sources claim Ringgit opens lower against US dollar KL shares open higher US, Europe markets rise on rosy economic data Oil slumps as prospect of Trump victory roils global markets Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Malaysia growth push stymied by banks cautious on loans BNM: Ringgit fell against most world currencies in third quarter US stocks decline after rally as election takes centre stage Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: NYC builds sticky notes wall in defiance of Trump Reuters Video: Trudeau arrives in Cuba for state visit Reuters Video: The Rolling Stones' ‘Exhibitionism’ debuts in New York Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Related Articles Stocks, dollar push higher tracking Trump Trump rally lifts stocks, Wall Street at record high Global stocks rally with commodities on Trump bets as dollar weakens Global stocks fall as bonds rise with gold amid US election jitters Global stocks drop as US election angst boosts yen, gold Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Intel tumbled nearly 6 percent and was the biggest drag on all three indexes, after the chipmaker's disappointing current-quarter revenue forecast. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index dipped 0.8 percent. Oil prices surged more than 2 percent after a report showed an unexpected drop in U.S. crude stockpiles. The energy sector jumped 1.64 percent, the most in three weeks, also boosted by a 5.2 percent rise in Halliburton following its surprise quarterly profit. Morgan Stanley inched up 0.2 percent after its results rounded off a strong quarter for big U.S. banks. The financial sector has gained 1 percent since Thursday, a day before the banks started reporting, while the KBW bank index is up 2.1 percent. Through Tuesday, earnings from S&P 500 companies had largely beaten market expectations, putting them on track to post profit growth for the first time in five quarters. Analysts now estimate earnings increased 0.2 percent in the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "We would see the third quarter as the bottoming out of the earnings recession that we have been experiencing for the last year or so," said Tracy Maeter, global investment specialist, J.P. Morgan Private Bank in Philadelphia. "But it's likely to be a little bit noisy with a lot of dispersion across the sectors." At 11:00 a.m. ET (1500 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 76.12 points, or 0.42 percent, at 18,238.06. The S&P 500 was up 6.62 points, or 0.31 percent, at 2,146.22 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.83 points, or 0.07 percent, at 5,247.67. Five of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the consumer staples' 0.6 percent drop the steepest. The Federal Reserve is due to release its Beige Book at about 2:00 p.m. ET, giving anecdotal commentary on the health of the U.S. economy. The third and final U.S. presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton starts later in the evening. The stock market had gained on both days after the previous two debates, which were perceived to be won by Clinton. "The noise in the marketplace around politics can drive stocks in the short term, but in terms of the underlying influence ... that's going to be driven more by the economy and the profitability of companies," Maeter said. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,949 to 861. On the Nasdaq, 1,420 issues rose and 1,100 fell. The S&P 500 showed seven new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 34 new highs and 37 new lows.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 19 October 2016 | MYT 10:47 PM Wall Street flat as oil gains offset Intel’s drag At 9:43am ET (Wednesday), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 27.46 points, or 0.15%, at 18,189.4. The Reuters photo shows traders working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. NEW YORK: Wall Street was little changed on Wednesday as gains in energy and financial stocks were offset by a drop in technology shares, led by Intel. Intel fell 4.7%, the biggest drag on all three indexes, after the chipmaker’s disappointing current-quarter revenue forecast. The news pulled the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index 1.1% lower. Oil prices rose 1.3% as the dollar eased and data showed Chinese output dropped while US inventories shrunk. The energy sector’s 1.01% rise was the most among the 11 major S&P 500 indexes, also boosted by Halliburton’s 3% jump following its surprise quarterly profit. Morgan Stanley rose 1.7% after its quarterly profit and revenue beat consensus estimates, rounding off a strong quarter for big US banks. Fellow investment bank Goldman Sachs was up 1.3%. At 9:43am ET (1343 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 27.46 points, or 0.15%, at 18,189.4. The S&P 500 was up 0.22 point, or 0.01%, at 2,139.82 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 7.73 points, or 0.15%, at 5,236.10. Five of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower. Consumer staples fell the most, by 0.77%. The sector was dragged down by tobacco company Reynolds American, which fell 4% as its results missed estimates. Through Tuesday, earnings from S&P 500 companies had largely beaten market expectations, putting them on track to post profit growth for the first time in five quarters. Analysts now estimate earnings increased 0.2% in the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. While investors assess the flood of corporate earnings reports, they also await the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book at noon, which will contain commentary on economic health. The third and final US presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton starts later in the evening. A Clinton presidency would be more positive for the markets as her positions are more well known than those of Trump, according to a Reuters poll. Among earnings, pipeline operator Kinder Morgan and payments processor American Express will issue results after the close. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,643 to 965. On the Nasdaq, 1,140 issues rose and 1,091 fell. The S&P 500 index showed five new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 16 new highs and 21 new lows. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Stocks You May Be Interested Closure of 106 bank branches due to rationalisation plans, says Deputy Finance Minister Weak ringgit to impact 5 sectors Best smartphones for the holidays Alibaba's founder to support 'mini Jack Ma' until university graduation Private-public partnerships in a connected world Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Family looking for missing 13-year-old girl Fine-tune your songs MRT fare starts at RM1 Property Related advertisement Latest News Taliworks net profit jumps 80% SME contribution to GDP to grow 5%-5.5% this year Bank Negara asks foreign banks to refrain from trading NDFs Trump plans to scrap Dodd-Frank; for banks, it’s complicated Bank of Shanghai surges 44% on debut after US$1.6b IPO Most Viewed in Business Billionaire Ananda Krishnan exploring taking Astro private Weak ringgit to impact 5 sectors Bank Negara asks foreign banks to refrain from trading NDFs MRT fare starts at RM1 How to get the young to invest more and spend less Singapore to launch blockchain project for interbank payments Trump plans to scrap Dodd-Frank; for banks, it’s complicated KLCI slides at midday, ringgit weaker Malindo Air offering one million tickets to celebrate winning award Rail is a big theme in 2017 advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: U.S. stocks notched a second straight day of gains on Wednesday, as climbing oil prices lifted the energy sector and earnings from Morgan Stanley provided a boost to financials. Brent crude settled up 1.9 percent and U.S. crude settled up 2.6 percent after touching a 15-month high following a government report that showed a sharp drop in domestic inventories for the sixth week in seven. The energy sector rose 1.4 percent, its biggest gain in seven sessions. A 4.2-percent rise in Halliburton also provided a boost after the world's No.2 oilfield services provider posted third-quarter results. Morgan Stanley gained 1.9 percent after posting a better-than-expected quarterly profit to round out a string of solid results from big U.S. banks. The financial sector has risen in three of the past four sessions for a 1.7 percent advance. "We’re up because the (earnings) numbers are so great, the forward guidance is great and the banks just knocked it out of the park," said Ken Polcari, Director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York. "In the end, this quarter of earnings will not be negative, they will be slightly positive after it is all said and done." A disappointing revenue forecast from Intel capped the advance on Wall Street, however. The chipmaker tumbled 5.9 percent as the biggest drag on each of the three major indexes. The PHLX semiconductor index shed 0.45 percent. With 70 companies in the S&P 500 having reported earnings through Wednesday morning, 80 percent have topped earnings' expectations. Third quarter earnings are now expected to increase 0.5 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, which would be the first quarter of growth in five. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 40.68 points, or 0.22 percent, to 18,202.62, the S&P 500 gained 4.69 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,144.29 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.58 points, or 0.05 percent, to 5,246.41. The U.S. economy showed some signs of rising wage pressures in September and early October but overall compensation growth remained modest, the Federal Reserve said in its Beige Book report. The third and final U.S. presidential debate between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton is set to begin on Wednesday at 9 p.m. EDT (0100 GMT Thursday). Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.40-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.52-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 10 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 62 new highs and 56 new lows. About 5.97 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 6.45 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

(LiPo Ching/Bay Area News Group) By Bay Area News Group October 19, 2016 at 6:41 am In the wake of scandals threatening Yahoo’s $4.8 billion sale to Verizon and its user base, CEO Marissa Mayer on Tuesday said the company is working toward consummating the deal while taking “deep responsibility” for protecting users’ personal information. Yahoo beat Wall Street’s predicted per-share earnings for the third quarter, met revenue expectations and turned around last quarter’s big loss. Intel on Tuesday reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and sales. However, Intel’s fourth-quarter sales outlook proved a disappointment to investors, who sent the company’s shares down by more than 5 percent in after-hours trading. The Bay Area rental market is cooling: Third-quarter rents for the nine-county region have barely budged — they’re up 1 percent from a year ago — and in some cities have even fallen. After a year of turmoil that tarnished its image, software startup Zenefits had one message for the hundreds of customers that packed its first user conference Tuesday: Zenefits is back, and it’s better than ever. LinkedIn’s latest workforce diversity figures show that white and Asian employees still far outnumber black and Latino workers, but the tech firm says it’s striving to improve those numbers by creating a more inclusive culture for underrepresented groups.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Intel posts strong growth in the third quarter of 2016 by Jeff Kampman  8:19 AM on October 19, 2016 Intel wiped away any bad feelings from its bumpy second quarter yesterday with what it describes as record revenues and strong profitability. For the third quarter of 2016, the company took in $15.8 billion in revenue, a nine-percent year-on-year increase, and made $4.5 billion in operating income, up six percent from this time last year.   Q3 2016 Q3 2015 Change Revenue $15.8 billion $14.5 billion up 9% Operating income $4.5 billion $4.2 billion up 6% Net income $3.4 billion $3.1 billion up 9% Gross margin 63.3% 63.0% up 0.3% While CEO Brian Krzanich touted the company's continuing metamorphosis into a cloud-computing and Internet of Things company, Intel's traditional businesses also turned in strong results. The Client Computing Group took in $8.9 billion in revenue, up five percent year-over-year. Desktop platform volumes (a measure of processor and chipset sales as units) fell six percent year-on-year, but notebook platform volumes grew four percent and the average selling price of those platforms rose three percent. Intel's Data Center Group brought in $4.5 billion in revenue, up 10% year on year, and data center platform volume increased 12%. The Internet of Things group posted $689 million in revenue, up 19% year on year. That strong growth should please Intel, since the data center and IoT are where it's staked its plans for future expansion. Meanwhile, the Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group took in $649 million in revenue, a one-percent year-on-year decrease; the Security Group took in $537 million, a six-percent year-on-year increase; and the Programmable Solutions Group took in $425 million, a six-percent increase over the former Altera's revenue from a year ago. For the fourth quarter, Intel expects $15.7 billion in revenue, plus or minus $500 million, and it projects gross margins of 61%.

Get access to the new Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution that allows developers to create exciting new solutions with the Intel® Galileo and Intel® Edison boards. Visit the Intel® Developer Zone for IoT. Intro Internet of Things (IoT) is enabling our lives in new and interesting ways, but with that comes the challenge of analyzing and bringing meaning to the stream of continuously generated data. One IoT trend in the home is the use of multiple security cameras for monitoring purposes, resulting in large amounts of data generated from images and video. For example, one house with twelve cameras taking 180,000 images per day can easily generate 5 GB of data. These large amounts of data make manual analysis impractical. Some cameras have built-in motion sensors to only take images when change is detected, and while this helps to reduce the data, light changes and other insignificant movement will still be picked up and have to be sorted through. To monitor the home for what is wanted, OpenCV* presents a promising solution. For the purposes of this paper it is people and faces. OpenCV already has a number of pre-defined algorithms to search images for faces, people, and objects and can also be trained to recognize new ones. This article is a proof of concept to explore quickly prototyping an analytics solution at the edge using Intel® IoT Gateway computing power to create a Smarter Security Camera. Figure 1. Analyzed image from webcam with OpenCV* detection markers Set-up It starts with a Logitech* C270 Webcam with HD 720P resolution and 2.4 GHz Intel® Core™ 2 Duo processor. The webcam plugs into the USB port of Intel® Edison development board which turns it into an IP webcam streaming video to a website. Using the webcam with the Intel® Edison development board allows for the camera "sensor" to be easily propagated to different locations around a home. The Intel® IoT Gateway captures images from the stream and uses OpenCV to analyze them. If the algorithms detect that there is a face or a person in view, it uploads the image to Twitter*. Figure 2. Intel® Edison board and Webcam setup Figure 3. Intel® IoT Gateway Device Capturing the image The webcam must be USB video class (UVC) compliant to ensure that it is compatible with the Intel® Edison USB drivers. In this case a Logitech C270 Webcam is used. For a list of UVC compliant devices, go here: http://www.ideasonboard.org/uvc/#devices. To use the USB slot, the micro switch on Intel® Edison development board must be toggled up towards the USB slot. Note that this will disable the micro-USB below to it and disable Ethernet, power (the external power supply must be plugged in now instead of using the micro-USB slot as a power source), and Arduino* sketch uploads. Connect the Intel® Edison development board to the Gateway’s Wi-Fi* hotspot to ensure it can see the webcam. To check that the USB webcam is working, type the following into a serial connection. ls -l /dev/video0 A line similar to this one should appear: crw-rw---- 1 root video 81, 0 May  6 22:36 /dev/video0 Otherwise, this line will appear indicating the camera is not found. ls: cannot access /dev/video0: No such file or directory In the early stages of the project, the Intel® Edison development board was using the FFMEG library to capture an image and then send it over MQTT to the Gateway. This method has drawbacks as each image takes a few seconds to be saved which is too slow for practical application. To resolve this problem and make images ready to the Gateway on-demand, the setup switched to have the Intel® Edison development board continuously stream a feed that the Gateway could capture from at any time. This was accomplished using the mjpeg-streamer library. To install it on the Intel® Edison development board, add the following lines to base-feeds.conf with the following command: echo "src/gz all http://repo.opkg.net/edison/repo/all
src/gz edison http://repo.opkg.net/edison/repo/edison
src/gz core2-32 http://repo.opkg.net/edison/repo/core2-32" >> /etc/opkg/base-feeds.conf Update the repository index: opkg update And install: opkg install mjpg-streamer To the start the stream: mjpg_streamer -i "input_uvc.so -n -f 30 -r 800x600" -o "output_http.so -p 8080 -w ./www" MJEG compressed format is used to keep the frame rate high for this project. However, YUV format is uncompressed which leaves more detail for OpenCV. Experiment with the tradeoffs to see which one fits best. To view the stream while on the same Wi-Fi network, visit: http://localhost:8080/?action=stream, a still image of the feed can also be viewed by going to: http://localhost:8080/?action=snapshot. Change localhost to the IP address of Intel® Edison development board that should be connected to the Gateway’s Wi-Fi. The Intel® IoT Gateway sends an http request to the snapshot address and then saves the image to disk. Gateway The brains of the whole security camera is on the Gateway. OpenCV was installed into a virtual Python* environment to create a clean and segmented environment for OpenCV and not interfere with the Gateway’s Python version and packages. Basic install instructions for OpenCV linux can be found here: http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/linux_install/linux_install.html. These instructions need to be modified in order to install OpenCV and its dependencies on the Intel® Wind River* Gateway. GCC, Git, and python2.7-dev are already installed. Install CMake 2.6 or higher: wget http://www.cmake.org/files/v3.2/cmake-3.2.2.tar.gz
tar xf cmake-3.2.2.tar.gz
cd cmake-3.2.2
./configure
make
make install As the Wind River Linux* environment has no apt-get command, it can be a challenge to install the needed development packages. A workaround for this is to first install them on another 64-bit Linux* machine (running Ubuntu* in this case) and then manually copy the files to the Gateway. The full file list can be found on the Ubuntu site here: http://packages.ubuntu.com/. For example, for the libtiff4-dev package, files in /usr/include/<file> should go to the same location on the Gateway and files in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/<file> should got into /usr/lib/<file>. The full list of files can be found here: http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/amd64/libtiff4-dev/filelist. Install and copy the files over for packages listed below. sudo apt-get install  libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev
sudo apt-get install libjpeg8-dev libpng12-dev libtiff4-dev libjasper-dev  libv4l-dev Install pip, this will help install a number of other dependencies. wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
python get-pip.py Install the virutalenv, this will create a separate environment for OpenCV. pip install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper Once the virtualenv has been installed, create one called "cv." export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
mkvirtualenv cv Note that all the following steps are done while the "cv" environment is activated. Once "cv" has been created, it will activate the environment automatically in the current session. This can be seen in the command prompt at the beginning eg. (cv) root@WR-IDP-NAME. For future sessions it can be activated with the following command: . ~/.virtualenvs/cv/bin/activate And similarly be deactivated using this command (do not deactivate it yet): deactivate Install numpy: pip install numpy Get the OpenCV Source Code: cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Itseez/opencv.git
cd opencv
git checkout 3.0.0 And make it: mkdir build
cd build
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE \
-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \
-D INSTALL_C_EXAMPLES=ON \
-D INSTALL_PYTHON_EXAMPLES=ON \
-D OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=~/opencv_contrib/modules \

-D BUILD_opencv_python2=ON .. If the cv2.so file is not created, make OpenCV on the host Linux machine as well and copy the file over to /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages. Figure 4. Webcam capture of people outside with OpenCV detection markers To quickly create a program and connect a large number of capabilities and services together as with this project, Node-RED* was used. Node-RED is a quick prototyping tool that allows the user to visually wire together hardware devices, APIs, and various services. It also comes pre-installed on the Gateway. Make sure to update to the latest version. Figure 5. Node-RED Flow Once a message is injected in at the "Start" node (by clicking on it), the script will loop continuously after processing the image or encountering an error. A few nodes of note for the setup are the http request, the python script, and the function message for the tweet. The "Repeat" node is to visually simplify the repeat flow into one node instead of pointing all three flows back to the beginning. The "http request" node sends a GET message to the IP webcam’s snapshot URL. If it is successful, the flow saves the image. Otherwise, it tweets an error message about the webcam. Figure 6: Node-RED http GET request node details To run the python script, create an "exec" node from the advanced section with the command "/root/.virtualenvs/cv/bin/python2.7 /root/PeopleDetection.py". This allows the script to run in the virtual python environment where OpenCV is installed. Figure 7: Node-RED exec node details The python script itself is fairly simple. It checks the image for people using the HOG algorithm and then looks for faces using the haarcasade frontal face alt algorithm that comes installed with OpenCV. It also saves an image with boxes drawn around found people and faces. The code provided below is not optimized for our proof of concept beyond the optional scaling the image down before analyzing it and tweaking some of the algorithm inputs to suit our purposes. It takes the Gateway approximately 0.33 seconds to process an image. In comparison, the Intel® Edison module takes around 10 seconds to process the same image. Depending on where the camera is located, and how far or close people are expected to be to it, the OpenCV algorithm parameters may need to change to better fit the situation. import numpy as np

Figure 8: Node-RED function message node details The system can take pictures on demand as well. Node-RED monitors the same twitter feed for posts that contain "spy" or "Spy" and will post a current picture to Twitter. Posting a tweet with the word "spy" in it will trigger the Gateway to take a picture. Figure 8: Node-RED flow for taking pictures on demand Summary This concludes the proof of concept to to create a Smarter Security Camer using Intel® IoT Gateway computing. The Wind River Linux Gateway comes with a number of tools pre-installed and ready to prototype quickly. From here the project can be further optimized, made more robust with security features, and even expanded to create smart lighting for rooms when a person is detected.

Earnings: Soft Guidance Overshadows Solid Results The chip titan did everything it had promised in the third quarter and more. But the stock took a quick haircut anyway because of soft fourth-quarter guidance. Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) Oct 19, 2016 at 9:03AM Image source: Getty Images. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) reported third-quarter results on Tuesday night. Following up on a rosy mid-quarter guidance update, the semiconductor giant delivered solid growth on both the top and bottom lines. However, investor expectations may have been a bit too high; Intel shares fell 5% in after-hours trading. Let's have a closer look at that market-moving report. Intel's third-quarter results: The raw numbers Metric Q3 2016 Actuals Q3 2015 Actuals Growth (YOY) Revenue $15.8 billion $14.5 billion 9.1% Net income $3.4 billion $3.1 billion 8.7% GAAP EPS (diluted) $0.69 $0.64 7.8% Data source: Intel. YOY = year over year. What happened with Intel this quarter? The quarter didn't work out exactly as outlined in the mid-September guidance update. In fact, most of the final results were better than the September forecast. The revenue till clicked $200 million above the updated forecast, led by strong sales in the Internet of Things division and the enterprise-oriented data center group. Both of those segments saw sales rising by double-digit percentages, compared with the same quarter of 2015. Costs associated with research and development plus mergers and acquisitions came in at $5.1 billion, in line with the original guidance target and $100 million below the September update. The ongoing restructuring program is running slightly ahead of schedule. Both gross margins and income tax rates came in just a hair stronger than previously expected. As usual, Intel provided a detailed slate of financial projections for the next reporting period. The fourth quarter should work out something like this: Sales should rise approximately 5% year over year, landing at $15.7 billion. GAAP gross margins are headed toward 61%, down from 64.3% in the year-ago quarter. Running the numbers on Intel's line-by-line forecast, GAAP earnings should stop near $0.68 per diluted share in the fourth quarter. That would be roughly 8% below the $0.74 per share seen in the fourth quarter of 2015. What management had to say In the earnings release, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich underlined the third quarter's solid results. "It was an outstanding quarter, and we set a number of new records across the business," Krzanich said. "We're executing well, and these results show Intel's continuing transformation to a company that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected devices." Looking ahead The fourth-quarter revenue forecast was set slightly below the normal seasonal trends. Furthermore, the gross margin picture is under pressure from factory start-up costs as Intel moves onto a next-generation manufacturing technology at the 10-nanometer node. The resulting mix of soft sales and flattish profits weighed on Intel's share prices, largely erasing the gains that were built on that September guidance update. The market can be a tricky beast. Strong results in the rearview mirror are often ignored when the road ahead shows a speed bump or two. What lies beyond those near-term challenges might not matter at all. That's the story behind Intel's falling share price this time. Anders Bylund owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel. Try any of our Foolish newsletter services free for 30 days.

Add A Comment With having delivered a number of RADV Radeon Vulkan benchmarks recently, time to turn the tables to see how the Intel Vulkan driver stack is comparing to its i965 classic Mesa DRI driver. Dota 2 benchmarks up today under Ubuntu 16.10 while using Mesa 12.10-dev and Linux 4.9. Ubuntu 16.10 doesn't ship with any Vulkan support out-of-the-box but it can be easily enabled. So before upgrading the Ubuntu 16.10 Yakkety Yak stack I first installed the mesa-vulkan-drivers and tested its stock performance (Mesa 12.0.3 + Linux 4.8). Following that I used the Padoka PPA to get the latest Mesa 12.1-dev Git code as of this week plus other updated user-space components. Lastly, the third run was using the updated Mesa stack while switching to the Linux 4.9 Git kernel as of yesterday. All benchmarks, of course, were done with the Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software. Even at a mere 800x600 resolution, the OpenGL Dota 2 Linux performance was a few frames faster than under the Vulkan renderer... For both graphics APIs, the performance does seem to increase a bit with Linux 4.9. As the resolution increased, the Intel OpenGL driver continued running faster than the ANV Vulkan driver. At 1080p, the Intel OpenGL Mesa driver remained faster than its Vulkan driver even with Mesa and Linux 4.9 Git. Running some CPU usage tests, the results were close to the same between the renderers but if anything the Intel Vulkan driver is consuming slightly more of the CPU. Like the RADV driver, the Intel Vulkan driver has more maturing still to do.

Revenue was also above forecasts, with Morgan Stanley's results helped by a surge in bond trading activity among other factors. Halliburton — The oilfield services company posted a surprise profit of one cent per share, compared to analysts' forecasts for a six cents per share loss. Revenue did come in below forecasts, but Halliburton's bottom line was helped by cost cuts. Reynolds American — The tobacco producer missed estimates by three cents a share, with quarterly profit of 61 cents per share. Revenue also fell short of forecasts. Supervalu — The supermarket chain matched forecasts with earnings of 10 cents per share, but revenue came up short due to weaker-than-expected sales at the retail level. Wells Fargo — Wells Fargo is delaying a planned 10-year bond sale after S&P revised the bank's credit rating outlook to "negative" from "stable." However, the bond is expected to price today, according to a Dow Jones report. Yahoo — Yahoo reported adjusted quarterly profit of 20 cents per share, six cents a share above estimates. Revenue was in line with forecasts. Yahoo has a deal in place to be sold to Verizon, but some doubts have recently been cast upon the deal because of the recently revealed 2014 data hack. Intel — Intel beat estimates by seven cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of 80 cents per share. The chipmaker's revenue also beat forecasts in what the company said was an "outstanding" quarter. Intel's results were helped by growth in its data center and cloud businesses, as well as better demand for personal computers. However, the shares are under pressure because of apparent disappointment over data center business growth rates. Starbucks — Starbucks named its first-ever chief executive officer for its China operations. Belinda Wong, who had been president of that unit, becomes CEO, with the coffee chain aiming to double its China presence to 5,000 stores by 2021. News Corp. — News Corp.'s Dow Jones unit has told its employees union that it is planning a restructuring because of ad sales volatility. The Wall Street Journal — a Dow Jones publication — reports that it is not yet clear what form the restructuring would take, but that it may involve a reduction in head count. Microsoft — The company's Surface tablets were the target of criticism from New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick, who said he will not use them anymore on the sidelines because the devices do not perform consistently. Intuitive Surgical — Intuitive Surgical reported adjusted quarterly profit of $6.19 per share, well above estimates of $5.14 a share. The surgical products maker's revenue was also above forecasts. However, shares came under pressure after the company maintained its prior full-year forecast. Hewlett Packard Enterprise — HPE reaffirmed its full-year forecast at a meeting with analysts, but the cloud services and solutions company said it would see some short-term pressure after two planned spinoffs close during the coming fiscal year. Visa — The credit card issuer increased its quarterly dividend by 2.5 cents to 16.5 cents per share, a rise of 18 percent. Apple — Apple plans to launch new versions of its Mac computers at an October 27 event, according to Recode.

Resend activation e-mail Risk Assessment / Security & Hacktivism Flaw in Intel chips could make malware attacks more potent “Side channel” in Haswell CPUs lets researchers bypass protection known as ASLR. by Dan Goodin - Oct 19, 2016 11:00 am UTC Login to bookmark 78 Researchers have devised a technique that bypasses a key security protection built into just about every operating system. If left unfixed, this could make malware attacks much more potent. ASLR, short for "address space layout randomization," is a defense against a class of widely used attacks that surreptitiously install malware by exploiting vulnerabilities in an operating system or application. By randomizing the locations in computer memory where software loads specific chunks of code, ASLR often limits the damage of such exploits to a simple computer crash, rather than a catastrophic system compromise. Now, academic researchers have identified a flaw in Intel chips that allows them to effectively bypass this protection. The result are exploits that are much more effective than they would otherwise be. Nael Abu-Ghazaleh, a computer scientist at the University of California at Riverside and one the researchers who developed the bypass, told Ars: ASLR is an important defense deployed by all commercial Operating Systems. It is often the only line of defense that prevents an attacker from exploiting any of a wide range of attacks (those that rely on knowing the memory layout of the victim). A weakness in the hardware that allows ASLR to be bypassed can open the door to many attacks that are stopped by ASLR. It also highlights the need for CPU designers to be aware of security as part of the design of new processors. An Intel spokesman said he was investigating the research paper. Abu-Ghazaleh and two colleagues from the State University of New York at Binghamton demonstrated the technique on a computer running a recent version of Linux on top of a Haswell processor from Intel. By exploiting a flaw in the part of the CPU known as the branch predictor, a small application developed by the researchers was able to identify the memory locations where specific chunks of code spawned by other software would be loaded. In computer security parlance, the branch predictor contains a "side channel" that discloses the memory locations. When branches collide A table in the predictor called the "branch target buffer" stores certain locations known as branch addresses. Modern CPUs rely on the branch predictor to speed up operations by anticipating the addresses where soon-to-be-executed instructions are located. They speculate whether a branch is taken or not and, if taken, what address it goes to. The buffers store addresses from previous branches to facilitate the prediction. The new technique exploits collisions in the branch target buffer table to figure out the addresses where specific code chunks are located. Nothing's stopping malicious attackers from bundling a similar bypass app with attack code that exploits a critical OS or application vulnerability. The exploit could then use the disclosed memory location to ensure malicious payloads are successfully executed by a targeted computer, instead of being flushed without ever being run, as is normally the case when ASLR is active. The researchers believe that ASLR implemented by both Microsoft Windows and Apple's OS X is similarly vulnerable. They have yet to perform research on other chip architectures to see if they also contain side channels that defeat ASLR. The branch target buffer side channel isn't the only method for bypassing ASLR. Exploits often circumvent the protection by exploiting a second so-called memory-disclosure vulnerability present in the targeted OS or application. The advantage with the new technique is that attackers need not identify a second weakness. The new attack also works across virtualization boundaries, allowing the attack to be carried out in cloud environments, for example. The new technique is also faster and more nimble than an older form of ASLR bypass known as JIT spraying. On Tuesday, the researchers presented the bypass at the IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture in Taipei, Taiwan. Their accompanying paper, titled "Jump Over ASLR: Attacking the Branch Predictor to Bypass ASLR," proposes several hardware and software approaches for mitigating attacks.

I am curious myself if Windows 8 and up is vulnerable to this. Previous versions of Windows had ASLR support, but starting with Windows 8, Microsoft added HEASLR support for 64-bit applications to allow for a much larger virtual addressable memory pool which gave much higher entropy (hence the HE in HEASLR). However, it's still a subset of ASLR, so it probably is still affected by this I would imagine. Either way, it's pretty scary. My desktop runs a Haswell CPU and I'm not planning on upgrading anytime soon. Hopefully Intel can issue like a microcode update or something to fix this. One of the mitigations recommended is to use 17 or more bits of entropy for ASLR. Windows' HEASLR (https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/srd ... echniques/) uses 24 bits, so the (unfounded) assumption would be that Windows 8 or higher is definitely improved for user mode processes. I'm not sure the kernel uses HEASLR though, so may be a weakness there. 859 posts | registered 10/27/2005 fuzzyfuzzyfungus Ars Scholae Palatinae jump to post I'm always amazed to see where people smarter than I am can find yet another side-channel. You take a casual look at something and it's "Nope, nothing to see here"; but it turns out that what looks like a black box is actually spilling state all over the place. 3340 posts | registered 7/2/2012 dmitry_e Smack-Fu Master, in training jump to post Thank you all for your interest in our paper and your comments. Security is an arms race - attackers have their bag of tricks, and defenders have an array of mitigation schemes (ASLR, DEP, etc). Modern attacks are complex and chain multiple exploits, and no single defense is sufficient by itself. Our paper simply demonstrates how the attackers can bypass or weaken one of the defenses. It is not Intel’s fault - they have been designing branch predictors this way even before ASLR was introduced and it is unreasonable to expect them to consider future attacks like that. Can Intel redesign their branch prediction logic to have this attack vector go away in principle? Yes, absolutely. Should they? It depends on the trade-offs between cost, complexity, performance, power and security risks. It may be easier to harden ASLR in OS kernel implementations, but this may have implications that only kernel developers can assess. We also want to emphasize that our paper considers attacks on both KASLR and user-level ASLR. Current KASLR implementations are very simple and basically come for free, it is not a surprise that they are vulnerable to attacks, previous research also demonstrated attacks on KASLR using, for example, shared caches. Our results for user-level ASLR attack are less conclusive - we show that the entropy can be weakened, but it is not clear to what extent (future research is needed). It is important to make both CPU manufacturers and OS kernel designers aware of this issue so that more secure systems can be designed in the future. 1 post | registered 10/20/2016 Reader comments 78 You must login or create an account to comment.

The highlights of the report, as headlined by Intel, include record quarterly revenue of $15.8 billion, which is a gain of 9 per cent on last year's figure. From the revenue Intel made profits of $4.5 billion. However, investors were not pleased with Intel's revenue guidance concerning Q4, which has resulted in Intel stock slipping as much as 5 per cent in value in afterhours trading. "It was an outstanding quarter, and we set a number of new records across the business," said Intel CEO, Brian Krzanich, in the news release accompanying the financial statement. "In addition to strong financials, we delivered exciting new technologies while continuing to align our people and products to our strategy. We're executing well, and these results show Intel’s continuing transformation to a company that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected devices." However, part of the reason the investors are disappointed with Q4 projections is the impact of the 'continuing transformation' and necessary investments. Intel EVP Stacy Smith told CNBC the Q4 guidance is lower mainly due to Intel's next-gen manufacturing process start-up costs. Other negative influences on the Q4 outlook include; a forecast of $15.7 billion in revenue while analysts expected about $15.87 billion. Smith also expects the worldwide PC supply chain "to reduce their inventory," – this will impact the usual buoyant Q4. Looking at the current set of results (Q3 2016) the traditional PC business still accounts for greater than half of Intel's total revenue and it went up by nearly $9 billion, that's 5 per cent year on year. Intel's data centre business revenue was up nearly 10 per cent to $4.45 billion. IoT revenue was up 20 per cent to $689 million. Meanwhile Intel's Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group revenue was $649 million, down 1 percent year on year (but up 17 per cent sequentially). Intel Security Group revenue at $537 million was up by 6 per cent. Overall the ascent of the Intel share price looks to have hit a speed bump as the growth areas that Intel is aiming at aren't quite providing the desired sparkling results at this time.

Image: Toni Genes/Shutterstock A rise in data centre business, PC operations and overall net income impressed for Intel in Q3, but its forecast isn’t pleasing many. Intel’s Q3 results were revealed yesterday and came in above analyst predictions, thanks in part to a surprising rise in the company’s PC business. It rose by by 4.5pc year-on-year to $8.89bn, with the company’s data centre business up 9.7pc to $4.54bn. Though despite the impressive figures, and a rise in net income from $3.11bn to $3.38bn, it was Intel’s forecast that most interested investors – and the outlook doesn’t impress many. Projecting $15.7bn in revenues for Q4 (down on analyst estimates which were around $15.86bn), shares were down following the announcement of the news. “This is below the average seasonal increase for the fourth quarter as we expect the worldwide PC supply chain to reduce their inventory,” said Stacy Smith, Intel’s executive VP. The supply and demand of PCs, on which Intel relies so much, is in a worrying era for the company. Despite the surprise raising of its Q3 forecast last month, PC sales are looking increasingly unreliable. According to recent figures from Gartner, the desktop computer is already fading from view. A two-year period of solid decline was recently underlined by an almost 12pc total fall in Lenovo, HP, Dell, Asus, Apple, Acer and all other manufacturers’ sales in the past year. HP, Dell and Asus actually had marginal gains but, beyond the major operators, the drop was so dramatic that the entire industry was dragged down. Given that over half of Intel’s revenues come from its PC business, this is clearly an ongoing concern – though its cloud operations may point towards some positivity. Revenue growth from this unit for the full year will likely be in the high single digits, Brian Krzanich, Intel’s CEO, said on the call with Reuters. Demand for cloud-based services has been growing as more businesses shift to cloud-computing methods. “It was an outstanding quarter, and we set a number of new records across the business,” said Krzanich. “In addition to strong financials, we delivered exciting new technologies while continuing to align our people and products to our strategy. “We’re executing well, and these results show Intel’s continuing transformation to a company that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected devices.” Intel.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 19 October 2016 | MYT 3:00 PM Intel's results beat estimates; forecast disappoints Promising sector: Demand for cloud-based services has been growing as more businesses shift to cloud-computing methods. — Reuters Intel Corp reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, boosted by improving PC demand and growth in its datacentre and cloud businesses, but its revenue forecast for the current quarter disappointed Wall Street. The world's largest chipmaker's shares were down 5.3%  in after-hours trading on Tuesday. Intel said it expects fourth-quarter revenue of US$15.7bil (RM65.8bil), plus or minus US$500mil (RM2bil). Analysts on average were expecting US$15.86bil (RM66.2bil), according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "This is below the average seasonal increase for the fourth quarter as we expect the worldwide PC supply chain to reduce their inventory," executive vice president Stacy Smith said on a conference call with analysts. Last month, Intel raised its third-quarter revenue forecast for the first time in more than two years, citing improving PC demand. The company's decision to raise third-quarter forecast moved investors' expectations to a higher level, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy said. Revenue from the datacentre business, which offers storage and cloud-based software services, rose 9.7% to US$4.54bil (RM19bil) in the third quarter, from a year earlier. Revenue growth from this unit for the full year will likely be in the high single digits, Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said on the call. Demand for cloud-based services has been growing as more businesses shift to cloud-computing methods. Intel, which has been hurt due to weak PC demand, said last month it was seeing signs of improvement among PC parts suppliers. According to research firm IDC, global PC shipments fell by a smaller-than-expected 3.9% in the third quarter. Revenue from the company's traditional PC business, which still accounts for over half of Intel's total revenue, rose 4.5% to US$8.89bil (RM37.2bil). Excluding items, the company earned 80 cents per share, above analysts' average estimate of 73 cents. The company's net revenue rose 9.1% to US$15.78bil (RM66.1bil), beating the average analyst estimate of US$15.58bil (RM65.3bil). Net income rose to US$3.38bil (RM14.16bil), or 69 cents per shares, in the third quarter ended Oct 1, from US$3.11bil (RM13.02bil), or 64 cents per share, a year earlier. Up to Tuesday's close, Intel's shares had risen 9.6%  this year, lagging the 22.8% gain in the broader Philadelphia semiconductor index. —  Reuters You May Be Interested Closure of 106 bank branches due to rationalisation plans, says Deputy Finance Minister Weak ringgit to impact 5 sectors Best smartphones for the holidays Alibaba's founder to support 'mini Jack Ma' until university graduation Private-public partnerships in a connected world Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Dept: Need further studies on Malacca relics Tourists now prefer lodgings with Airbnb flavour, hoteliers told MRT fare starts at RM1 advertisement Latest News Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Make perfect copies of old photos with PhotoScan US trade panel eyes Qualcomm patent complaint against Chinese firms Google commits to post-Brexit UK with major London investment GE acquires two artificial intelligence startups Most Viewed in Tech Make perfect copies of old photos with PhotoScan GE acquires two artificial intelligence startups Best smartphones for the holidays Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Singapore to launch blockchain project for interbank payments Google commits to post-Brexit UK with major London investment US trade panel eyes Qualcomm patent complaint against Chinese firms Warning!

Mark Hachman (PC World (US online)) on 19 October, 2016 10:10 0 - - - - print email Though Intel’s PC group, data center, and Internet of Things businesses helped drive Intel to record revenue in its third quarter of 2016, all eyes seemed focused on one number: the company’s fourth-quarter forecast, which isn’t great. Intel achieved a 9 percent year-over-year increase in profits, up to $3.4 billion, and a 9 percent increase in revenue as well, to a record high of $15.8 billion. Unfortunately, the company’s projections for fourth-quarter revenues are actually slightly down: $15.7 billion, with some $500 million either way in terms of wiggle room. Traditionally, Intel sees its highest revenue in the fourth quarter, so the numbers provide an indication of how the holiday tech sales season is expected to go. What this means: In all, it was the sort of topsy-turvy earnings report not usually associated with Intel: The Client Computing Group, which oversees Intel’s PC processors, reported 5 percent growth, which was higher than expected. That flies in the face of continued predictions that the PC market is in decline. Intel also reported that revenue from its enterprise businesses—usually a strong, stable sector—hadn’t quite met expectations. The PC stands out Intel executive Stacy Smith, in his last quarter as Intel’s chief financial officer, commented on the Client Computing Group's surprise growth to $8.9 billion: “Everything went right: they had phenomenal growth, they had unit costs coming down, they were making prudent dis-investment decisions." Smith added, “When you add all that up, they become a real cash and profit driver for the company.” Intel executives didn’t talk much about the company’s products, let alone specifics. But the company’s next frontier is 3D Xpoint, which executives hope could one day replace the flash memory technology used in today’s SSDs, and update computer memory as well. Intel executives said 3D Xpoint is now sampling to customers, who will begin qualifying the next-generation memory technology at the end of this quarter. (Qualification is a testing process to ensure a number of things, including the viability of the technology and its compatibility with customers' existing products.) Brian Krzanich, Intel’s chief executive, said that sales of the products would begin in 2017 and increase throughout the year. As Intel ramps up production, 3D Xpoint’s costs should decrease, he added.

Intel beats earnings, falls on weak guidance InvestorPlace 10/18/2016 James Brumley © Provided by InvestorPlace Intel Corporation (INTC) Beats Earnings, Falls on Weak Guidance Investors could have viewed the glass as half full for Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) following the release of last quarter’s numbers after the closing bell rang on Tuesday. They just didn’t. Quotes in the article Intel Corp INTC ▲ 34.91 +0.43 +1.25% Netflix Inc NFLX ▲ 113.59 +0.21 +0.19% Last quarter — the company’s third fiscal quarter of the year — Intel earned 69 cents per share on a GAAP basis, or 80 cents on a non-GAAP basis, on revenue of $15.78 billion — a 9% improvement for the top line. In the same quarter a year earlier, the technology company earned 64 cents per share of INTC stock on revenue of $14.5 billion. Analysts, however, were collectively expecting sales of $15.56 billion and income of 72 cents per share of INTC. Intel stock fell 4% in after-hours trading following the release of the results. 16 Best Stocks to Buy Under President Hillary Clinton CEO Brian Krzanich commented: “It was an outstanding quarter, and we set a number of new records across the business. In addition to strong financials, we delivered exciting new technologies while continuing to align our people and products to our strategy. We’re executing well, and these results show Intel’s continuing transformation to a company that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected devices.” Dethroned by Shift in Consumer Tastes Once the big name in computer processors, the rise of tablets and smartphones and the subsequent deterioration of PC sales have taken a bite out of Intel’s business. INTC didn’t have a small, power-efficient processor that manufacturers could get wholly behind. Its Atom processor was a respectable entry in that race, but simply couldn’t compete with Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) or Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF). That’s a big part of the reason Intel has all but abandoned the mobile processor market, though not permanently. It’s diving headfirst into the 5G and Internet of Things (IoT) chipset market, even if it was late getting started. That, however, won’t bear revenue until 2020. The company should serve up something more compelling to INTC shareholders between now and then. For instance, in August, the company upped its third-quarter revenue guidance from $14.9 billion to $15.6 billion. An unexpected uptick in PC sales was cited as the reason. IT market research outfit Gartner doesn’t see it quite the same way, reporting just last week that PC sales fell 5.7% during the third quarter. Intel delivered on this front, though. Client Computing revenue grew 5% on a year-over-year basis, to $8.9 billion. That was 21% better than Q2’s sales for the Client Computing arm. It’s possible Intel is gaining market share in the still-shrinking PC market, but if the company is to thrive in the foreseeable future, it’s going to be mostly driven by strong enterprise-level revenue. Enterprise Is the Future The data-center arm now contributes roughly half of Intel’s operating profits. Although, its data center revenue come up short of revenue forecasts in each of the prior three quarters, it’s still generated growth, and ramped that growth pace up last quarter. Data Center Group revenue reached $4.5 billion, up 13% from Q2’s tally, and 10% better than year-ago levels. Its Internet of Things division drove $689 million in sales, which was higher by 20% sequentially, and up 19% versus its year-ago total. Nevertheless, Intel needs to be smart on this front. Just this week, a consortium that includes Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) and several other top technology names was formed with the intent of developing new data center architecture. This hardware will accelerate machine learning and analytics, and could end up serving as competitor to Intel’s data center offering. Intel also needs to be cost-conscious on the R&D front. Research and development costs along with management and administrative costs were up 5% to $5.1 billion last quarter. While its data center business will soon be under pressure and the company has abdicated the mobile processor market, it’s not abdicated the mobile market altogether. Its smartphone modem chips were selected as that component in the recently launched iPhone 7 from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), underscoring the idea that Intel’s diverse foundry can create ways to ride the rising tide of smartphones and tablets. By that same token, Intel is increasingly adding component chips to hardware that isn’t necessarily made by Intel or made for Intel chipsets. It’s going to need to do a lot more of those kinds of deals, however. Edward Jones analyst Bill Kreher accurately pointed out that the iPhone supply deal wasn’t meaningful enough to matter to the bottom line. Should You Go Against the Grain and Sell Netflix Stock? (NFLX) Looking ahead,the company guides for Q4 revenue of $15.7 billion. No per-share guidance was offered. Analysts, however, were expecting Intel to report earnings of 76 cents per share of INTC on $15.85 billion. Both are improvements on the Q4 2015 results, but the disappointing revenue guidance fanned the bearish flames that sent Intel stock lower after the close. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

(Associated Press files) By Mike Rogoway, The Oregonian Published: October 18, 2016, 6:26 PM A   A PORTLAND — Intel reported its strongest quarterly growth in nearly five years Tuesday, with third-quarter sales that exceeded even an updated forecast the world’s largest chipmaker issued last month. PC and data center growth beat forecasts, according to financial results released Tuesday, but Intel forecasts slower growth in the fourth quarter. That sent shares down 3.4 percent in after-hours trading. Intel is in the midst of a broad transition, reducing its dependence on the fading PC market. The company hopes to replace that segment with an assortment of technologies including servers, memory chips, mobile devices and connected objects known as the “Internet of Things.” Intel began that transition last spring, announcing plans to eliminate 12,000 jobs. The shift has been smoother than anticipated because PC sales are holding up better than expected. Sales of PCs and other products in Intel’s “client” group climbed 5 percent last quarter. Sales to data centers climbed 10 percent — higher than in recent quarters, but below Intel’s long-term growth forecast of roughly 15 percent. “We’re executing well, and these results show Intel’s continuing transformation to a company that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected devices,” Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said in a written statement. Financial highlights include: • Sales of $15.8 billion, up 9 percent from the same quarter last year. That’s Intel’s fastest growth since the fourth quarter of 2011. • Profits totaled $3.4 billion, up 9 percent from the same period last year. • Earnings per share were 69 cents, up from 64 cents a year earlier. Intel boosted its forecast for restructuring charges by $700 million, to $2.3 billion, in part because it is spinning out its McAfee online security business. Intel said it spent $1.8 billion of its restructuring budget thus far. Intel said its worldwide employment is now 106,000, down about 6,000 from the start of its restructuring last spring. The company had more than 19,000 Oregon employees before those cuts began. Intel shares have been trading near a multiyear high in recent weeks, and climbed another 46 cents Tuesday to close at $37.75.

It's a beat on earnings and revenue, but a miss on fourth quarter guidance. Investors aren't too impressed and Intel's stock is down ~3.5% in after hours. Here are the most important numbers: EPS (GAAP): $0.69 per share vs. $0.67 per share estimated EPS (non-GAAP): $0.80 per share vs. $0.72 per share estimated Revenue: $15.8 billion vs. $15.6 billion estimated (up 9% year-over-year) Intel reported record-high quarterly revenue, but gave fourth quarter revenue guidance of $15.7 billion, below analyst estimates of $15.86 billion. Intel's Client Computing Group, which includes its PC and mobile business, had revenue of $8.9 billion, up 5% year-over-year, while its data center business saw revenue of $4.5 billion, up 10% from a year-ago period. That 10% growth in the data center is a big jump from last quarter's 5% year-over-year growth, but still a bit disappointing given that the company's forecast to record "double-digit" growth for the full year, and would need to grow ~20% in the second half to get there. Intel also disclosed that the total restructuring cost would reach $2.3 billion in total. Earlier this year, Intel announced the biggest layoffs in history that would eliminate roughly 12,000 jobs.  This is the first earnings report for new CFO Bob Swan, who was hired last month to replace Stacy Smith. Swan was previously a partner at General Atlantic and eBay. Smith is now overseeing the company's sales, manufacturing and operations.

Intel keeps lowering the bar on the business it's bet its future onVon Eugene Kim | Business Insider – Mi., 19. Okt 2016 01:19 MESZ Freigeben 0 Twittern 0 Share0 Drucken Firmen: Intel Corporation AKTUELLER KURS Symbol Kurs Veränderung INTC 34,91 +0,43 (Intel CEO Brian KrzanichIntel) With Intel's bread-and-butter PC business slowly evaporating, the chip company has restructured its operations and tied its future to the lucrative data center market.  But there's one big problem: Intel keeps missing its growth targets for the data center business. And Wall Street has noticed.  Intel's stock initially fell 3.5% after reporting third quarter results on Tuesday. After Intel executives opened their mouths during the conference call, the stock slid further, and is now down 6%.  During the call, Intel execs lowered the bar for the Data Center Group's growth this year to the "high-single digits." The data center group is Intel's most important business, accounting for nearly half of the company's operating profit.  With 90% market share, Intel is in a strong position in the data center market. But the company is struggling to build upon that strength and is instead seeing its growth slow. Throughout the year, Intel has stepped down its datacenter expectations from "15%" to "mid-teens" to "double digits" — and now it's saying it'll come in at "high-single digits" for the full year. "It’s a problem. Intel has hit its growth target for Data Center Group only once in the last 6 years," Bernstein's Stacy Rasgon told Business Insider. Cannibalization problem? Intel's data center business recorded $4.5 billion in revenue in the third quarter, up 10% year-over-year (it only grew 5% and 9% in the past two quarters, respectively). Krzanich noted that the data center business saw strong growth in most areas, including the cloud and networking units, but it was offset by the decline in the enterprise segment. "The enterprise market hasn’t shored up there," Krzanich said. "But don’t take this as I’m saying [enterprise] is going to be a growth segment...we should see some level of stabilization or less of a decline." Bernstein's Rasgon says it's a concern that the enterprise is not seeing enough growth. The cloud segment is growing fast, but that likely means it's doing so at the expense of eating into the enterprise's business. "A portion of cloud growth is enterprises outsourcing their datacenter workloads to the cloud, therefore there is an open question of whether strong cloud growth and weak enterprise are independent trends or coupled," Rasgon said.

Photo by Louis Keene If you watch an NBA highlight on Facebook, Twitter or the league’s website, chances are an Israeli startup’s software produced and distributed it — automatically. Now, the Los Angeles Dodgers are betting that the company’s groundbreaking technology will dictate the future of sports content creation. WSC Technologies — which has attracted investments from Microsoft and Intel, among others — is one of five fledgling tech companies participating in the Dodgers Accelerator, a venture capital program that funds and develops sports-focused startups. Originally a passion project intended for use by coaches and scouts, WSC is breaking out in a rapidly changing digital media market. “We’re still four guys out of Israel and we don’t know everybody, even though we’ve been around for a few years,” said co-founder Aviv Arnon. “[The Dodgers Accelerator] helps us to get to the right people, at the right time.” Arnon was in Los Angeles recently for client meetings as WSC’s head of business development.  Arnon and two of WSC’s other three co-founders studied engineering together at Tel Aviv University through Atuda, the four-year, pre-enlistment academic reserve of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Joining the IDF ranks at 22, Arnon put his education to use building video interrogation systems and flight footage analysis; Daniel Shichman, now the company’s CEO, handled transmission and bandwidth for the Iron Dome weapons system. Shmulik Yoffe is now the company’s chief technology officer. They explored the idea of automated sports video editing in their spare time. “It was kind of a hobby,” Arnon said. “Making this our primary job, we started to figure out where can it scale, where’s the opportunity, and what we wanted as fans.” Atuda requires a six-year service in the IDF, but Arnon wound up staying an extra 18 months because the late-night coding sessions — building what would become WSC’s core technology — were so productive.  What emerged from their work by the time they concluded their enlistment in 2011 was AVGEN, an application that automatically parses games into hundreds of individual video clips — including, for example, each of a basketball team’s offensive possessions in a game. The software attaches metadata that indicates outcomes of plays and the players involved based on analysis of the announcer’s voice, facial recognition and other elements of the game. It then streamlines the creation of highlight montages by allowing a user to choose a player, an outcome (such as a field goal, an assist, a 3-point basket), a time period (the previous game, or an earlier game) and a reel length — and then playing the finished product in a matter of seconds. The WSC founders thought it would be a useful tool for coaches and scouts, which their fourth co-founder, Chief Operating Officer Hy Gal — as someone involved in basketball coaching — could help them market with connections to coaches. The trouble, Arnon said, was selling it to a coach and training him on the software, only to have to repeat the whole process when the coach was fired. “We were just soldiers in the army,” Arnon said. “We didn’t know exactly the market, who to talk to. It took us a couple of years of figuring that out on our own.” Then WSC pivoted to suit the more lucrative market of sports media.  The company got its start producing highlights for the Israeli channel Sport5 and for UEFA Champions League soccer. After a $1 million seed round of venture capital funding, WSC got a meeting with the NBA’s Development League, or D-League, whose executives at first didn’t believe automated highlights were technologically possible. Arnon, Shichman and Yoffe got to work. Two years later, WSC had full buy-in not only from the D-League but the NBA as well. Last season, 28 of the 30 NBA teams used AVGEN to publish highlights to team sites and social media, garnering hundreds of millions of views. WSC’s partnership with the Dodgers should be mutually beneficial, though it isn’t yet producing Dodgers highlights. The Dodgers can connect WSC to new business opportunities with Major League Baseball and are hoping their franchise’s globally recognized brand will help WSC extend its market reach to other sports. In exchange for their contribution to WSC’s $12 million Series B round of funding, the Dodgers receive equity in the startup. “They’re incredibly impressive,” Dodgers Chief Financial Officer Tucker Kain said of WSC’s founders. Kain launched the Accelerator last year in a partnership with R/GA, a digital marketing agency. “It takes an incredible balance of technical skills needed to create a platform like this and then to build out and commercialize it for a variety of different people.” The AVGEN software has special utility when it comes to international athletes who are followed obsessively in their home countries. Arnon said that when Sport5 posts the highlights of Omri Casspi, an Israeli basketball player on the NBA’s Sacramento Kings, it’s usually the most-watched video clip in Israel that night.  Arnon has lofty ambitions for the future of sports video consumption and WSC’s place in it. Instead of creating thousands of videos each night, he said, AVGEN eventually will be cutting millions of highlight reels tailored to each consumer’s favorite players, fantasy teams or rooting interests. “Each fan is his own market,” Arnon said. Someday, he added, “instead of watching ‘SportsCenter,’ you get your own sports personalized newscast. This is the way things are shaping up — it’s happening with or without us.” The increasing demand for short-form content in all types of entertainment also aligns with WSC’s specialty. Arnon said his increasingly packed travel schedule reflects the growing interest WSC is seeing in its product. Although the company is still headquartered in Tel Aviv, Arnon joked that his second office is at 30,000 feet. He had trips to Atlanta, Toronto and New York planned for a recent week in the United States, leaving no time for stops at Israeli restaurants along the way, he said. But he’s thrilled that WSC’s once-doubted technological capability is finally being validated. “We’re no longer coming to pitch it as a few guys from Israel telling a story,” Arnon said. “We’re telling it as the guys who do it for the NBA.” RELATED TOPICS los angeles dodgers COMMENTS View our privacy policy and terms of service.

To many a spectator's surprise, the newly unveiled gaming PC wasn't a desktop, but another laptop destined for the maker's stable. However, Razer is straplining the new 17-inch Razer Blade Pro laptop as "the ultimate gaming desktop in a laptop." As mentioned in the intro, this is a large 17-inch laptop, the screen is 17.3-inches in diagonal to be exact. It is one of the many premium hardware components in the new Razer Blade Pro. The screen is made by Sharp, one of its IGZO UHD panels with LED backlighting. This 16:9 ratio screen with a resolution of 3840 x 2160 pixels offers 170 degree viewing angles, a 100 per cent Adobe RGB gamut, and capacitive multi-touch interactivity. With such a screen you would want a top class graphics accelerator and Razer doesn't disappoint with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 (8GB GDDR5X VRAM) equipped. This is backed up with the potent mobile processing power offered by Intel's Core i7-6700HQ processor (6MB Cache, up to 3.50GHz). An easy to glance-over bullet point spec list for the Razer Blade Pro follows: 17.3-inch IGZO UHD G-SYNC, 16:9 ratio, 3840 x 2160, with LED backlight, with capacitive multi-touch Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 (8GB GDDR5X VRAM) Intel Core i7-6700HQ Quad-Core Processor (2.6 GHz / 3.5 GHz) 32GB Dual-Channel System Memory (DDR4, 2133 MHz) 512GB SSD RAID 0 (2x 256GB PCIe M.2) or 1TB SSD RAID 0 (2x 512GB PCIe M.2) or 2TB SSD RAID 0 (2x 1TB PCIe M.2) options Razer Chroma lighting Windows 10 64-bit, no bloatware Anti-ghosting individually backlit ultra-low-profile mechanical keyboard Killer DoubleShot Pro: Killer Wireless-AC 1535 (IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac + Bluetooth 4.1), Killer E2400 (Gigabit Ethernet 10/100/1000) Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C), USB 3.0 port x3 (SuperSpeed), HDMI 2.0 video and audio output, SDXC card reader Built-in stereo speakers, Dolby Digital Plus Home Theatre Edition, 7.1 Codec support (via HDMI), 3.5 mm headphone/microphone combo port Built-in webcam (2.0 MP) Array microphone Razer Synapse enabled with programmable keyboard, trackpad, backlighting, and fan control Trusted Platform Module (TPM 2.0) security chip embedded Compact 250W power adapter, Built-in 99Wh rechargeable lithium-ion polymer battery Approx. Size: 0.88 in. / 22.5 mm (Height) x 16.7 in. / 424 mm (Width) x 11 in. / 281 mm (Depth), Approx. Weight: 7.80 lbs. / 3.54 kg In supplemental details the Razer Blade Pro is constructed using a unibody CNC aluminium chassis. Important in this class of laptop is an efficient thermal solution and Razer has implemented "the worlds thinnest manufactured vapour chamber cooling solution in a notebook," to keep the Pro purring along smoothly under duress. Another interesting feature is the RGB mechanical keyboard and trackpad configuration as you can clearly see below. Talking about the new Razer Blade Pro flagship, Min-Liang Tan, Razer co-founder and CEO reflected on his engineering team's achievements and how the firm had grown over a relatively short time. He referred to the new cooling system capabilities as "staggering". The Razer Blade Pro is expected to ship via RazerZone from November, in the US and in Europe. Pricing starts at US$3,699 / €4,199 / £3,499. Razer Blade Laptops available in Europe Razer's newest 12.5-inch Razer Blade Stealth ultraportable laptop and the 14-inch Razer Blade gaming have come to Europe. "The demand in Europe for a thin, powerful and portable laptop for gamers has inspired us every waking moment since we launched the Razer Blade five years ago," said Razer CEO and Co-Founder Min-Liang Tan before telling the crowd that the firm now had everything in place to sell and distribute these signature Razer systems "throughout Europe in 2016". The Razer Blade Stealth is a thin (13.1mm), light (1.29Kg), portable and powerful ultrabook. Buyers can choose from a 12.5-inch QHD or 4K screen. Razer describes it as the best choice for "gamers that go". Its thin and light construction means that it relies upon the Intel Skylake Core i7-7500U processor's integrated HD Graphics 520 when on the road. However, it is meant to come home to your desk to sit alongside the Razer Core (connects via Thunderbolt 3) to provide desktop class graphics and further expandability and connectivity. Razer thinks it has the ultimate laptop for those who definitely want integrated graphics but value portability with its new 14-inch Razer Blade. This laptop melds the power of a 6th gen Intel Core i7 quad-core processor, Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 graphics, 16GB of dual-channel memory, and PCIe-based SSD storage up to 1TB. It fits these components with a 14-inch full HD or QHD display in a slim (17.9mm) unibody aluminium chassis weighing in at approx 1.9Kg, depending on configuration. The 12.5-inch Razer Blade Stealth and 14-inch Razer Blade are available now in the UK, Germany and France priced at £999/ €1,099 and £1,749 / €1,999 respectively. They all ship with localised keyboard layouts for the buyers' region. You can buy them directly via Razerzone.com.

Print “From using enough green power to meet 100 percent of electricity needs to signing long-term contracts to enable new renewable energy projects, these organizations are demonstrating leadership by furthering the case for accessible, affordable green power use,” EPA said in a statement. There were five categories of winners and further details are available here: Excellence in Green Power Use Award: Biogen (Cambridge, Massachusetts);, BNY Nellon (New York City); Forest County Potawatomi Community (Crandon, Wisconsin); Goldman Sachs (New York City); Government of the District of Columbia (Washington, DC); Intel (Santa Clara, California) and SC Johnson (Racine, Wisconsin.) Green Power Partner of the Year Award: Cisco Systems (San Jose, California); Jackson Family Wines (Santa Rosa, California) and University at Buffalo, the State University of New York (Buffalo). Sustained Excellence in Green Power Award: Apple (Cupertino, California) and Kohl’s Direct Project Engagement Award: General Motors / GM Orion Assembly Plant (Lake Orion, Michigan); Google (Mountain View, California) and HARBEC (Ontario, New York). Green Power Community of the Year Award: Maplewood Community, Missouri. The awardees were selected based on a multitude of criteria, including the size and scale of their green power use, leadership and innovation in purchasing and generating green power, internal and external communications efforts, as well as organizational strategy for investing in green power. EPA’s Green Power Partnership is a voluntary program that goes “above and beyond” regulatory requirements and encourages organizations to use green power as a way to help reduce the environmental impacts associated with conventional electricity use. EPA defines green power as electricity that is generated from renewable sources, including solar, wind, geothermal, biogas, and low-impact hydroelectric sources. Green power does not produce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.

Intel is getting some help in its years-long effort to appeal a $1.4 billion fine levied in 2009 by European antitrust regulators. The chip maker has appealed the fine up through the European Union judicial system despite a series of setbacks, eventually reaching the European Union (EU) Court of Justice (ECJ). In an opinion this week, ECJ Advocate General Nils Wahl said the case should be sent back to the court that initially ruled against Intel and levied the record fine, questioning whether regulators had proved that rebates the chip maker had given to system makers in Europe had amounted to an abuse of its market dominance and harmed competition. The European Commission (EC)—the antitrust arm of the European Union—in 2009 fined Intel the $1.4 billion, saying the chip maker abused its market position to illegally try to keep PC makers from using x86 processors from rival Advanced Micro Devices. The General Court ruled that Intel acted improperly in offering loyalty rebates to PC makers like Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Acer, Lenovo and NEC between 2002 and 2005 if they bought all or most of their chips for their systems from Intel. Intel also was accused of putting stringent restrictions on the other 5 percent of PCs not using its processors, and of paying Media-Saturn, a retail chain in Germany, to only sell systems powered by Intel chips. As a result, AMD was effectively shut out from participating in the European PC market and deprived PC makers and end users of being able to take advantage of lower prices that may have been available in a more competitive market. Along with the fine, antitrust regulators also ordered Intel to stop offering illegal rebates. Intel officials have disputed the claims, saying the company competed aggressively against AMD and others but that its business practices never violated antitrust or other laws. They also appealed the fine, saying it was too harsh. The EU General Court in 2014 disagreed, ruling that regulators were correct in their assessments and that the fine was legitimate. The "fine is appropriate in the light of the facts of the case," the court said at the time in its ruling. The chip maker appealed to the ECJ in Luxembourg, making its arguments during a hearing June 21. In his opinion issued Oct. 20, the ECJ's Wahl agreed with many of Intel's arguments, saying that the General Court erred in ruling that the rebates and payments the chip maker made to OEMs created a non-competitive environment and harmed AMD or consumers in Europe. At the same time, Wahl also questioned whether deals made between Intel and Lenovo had similar impacts. "In the light of the nature of the errors committed by the General Court … the state of the present proceedings does not in my view permit final judgment to be given," Wahl wrote. "That is because a decision on the merits (whether or not the rebates and payments offered by Intel constitute an abuse of dominance contrary to Article 102 TFEU, as well as whether the Lenovo agreements had any immediate, substantial and foreseeable anticompetitive effect within the [European Economic Area]) hinges upon an examination of all the circumstances of the case and … of the actual or potential effect of Intel's conduct on competition within the internal market. That, in turn, involves an assessment of the facts which the General Court is better placed to carry out." Given that, "I propose that the Court should refer the case back to the General Court for a fresh review," he wrote. Wahl's opinion is non-binding, but the ECJ reportedly tends to follow the recommendations of its advisers. If the fine is eventually overturned, it could have a significant impact on similar cases the European Union is pursuing against other tech vendors, including Apple, Google and Qualcomm. "The extent to which the advocate general disagrees with the Commission is significant," Ian Giles, a partner at Norton Rose Fulbright in London, told Reuters. "The advocate general's opinion says—on the Intel facts—the commission got it wrong. Assuming the court follows this opinion, this is a good outcome from the perspective of competition policy, and may lead to the commission revising its approach in ongoing cases."           LATEST PC HARDWARE ARTICLES   Factors You Need to Consider When Replacing Aging Laptops New Microsoft Surface Books, Surface Dial Go on Sale Microsoft Nixes Xbox Streaming Stick AMD Targets Gaming, VR Content Creators With New Radeon Graphics Cards Microsoft Surface Devices Challenge Apple in Enterprise Strongholds                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Completely redesigned from ground up, the system is made specifically for enthusiasts and power users who want desktop performance but don't want to sacrifice portability. Packed with more power than ever before possible in a notebook under an inch thick, Razer's latest system is capable of handling virtually any task, anytime, anywhere. The new Razer Blade Pro features the latest Intel® Core™ i7 quad-core processor and next-generation NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 1080 GPU. It is the most powerful system ever built by Razer and the thinnest notebook available with a GTX 1080. Other highlights on the new Razer Blade Pro include Thunderbolt 3 for advanced connectivity options, 32 GB of DDR4 dual-channel memory, up to 2 TB of PCI M.2 SSD in RAID 0 storage and a built-in SD card reader. While other similarly equipped desktop replacements are more than two inches thick and weigh more than 10 pounds, the new Blade Pro retains its iconic form factor. Its unibody CNC aluminum chassis still measures just 0.88 inches thin while weighing less than eight pounds. The included AC adapter also dwarfs similarly powered systems and complements the overall mobility of the Blade Pro. Even more remarkable is the system's thermal management system. This all new thermal management system in the Blade Pro now includes the worlds thinnest manufactured vapor chamber cooling solution in a notebook. The vapor chamber reduces heat resistance and hotspots by spreading heat quickly, evenly and efficiently. A custom fan design and dynamic heat exchanger are paired with the vapor chamber to maximize heat dissipation. This allows the Razer Blade Pro to be the most powerful computer ever assembled in such a thin chassis. The rest of the desktop replacement notebook offers a similar no-compromises approach. A stunning 17.3-inch 4K IGZO monitor with NVIDIA G-SYNC™ technology produces the smoothest possible framerates. The display offers 100 percent Adobe RGB color accuracy to deliver stunning visuals to gamers and professionals. Additionally, the Razer Blade Pro is the first notebook to utilize Razer's Ultra-Low-Profile Mechanical switches. Each switch features a true actuation and reset point. Presses are registered with 65 grams of force, mimicking the feel of full-size mechanical keyboards. The keyboard and trackpad are also Powered by Razer Chroma™. This technology unlocks a virtually endless array of dazzling lighting effects that can be customized by the user or synced to display in-game events. The specs for the Blade Pro exceed minimum hardware requirements of HTC Vive™, Oculus Rift and OSVR HDK 2, making it one of the most mobile VR-ready devices for enthusiasts and developers. "The original 17-inch Blade was the first laptop that truly blended power and portability in a PC," says Min-Liang Tan, Razer co-founder and CEO. "We've taken that approach another step further with the new Razer Blade Pro. The thermal engineering behind it is staggering. It's incredible how far we've come, from having one product and a small team, to today, with a full catalog of gaming systems and a large group of engineers and designers pushing what a portable gaming machine can do." "It's impressive what Razer was able to pack into the new Razer Blade Pro," said Mark Aevermann, senior product lead for GeForce gaming laptops at NVIDIA. "They have managed to design a gaming laptop with our flagship GeForce GTX 1080, in a form factor gamers can take with them on the road." The 17-inch Blade Pro joins the rest of Razer's award-winning systems lineup. The 14-inch Razer Blade sets the benchmark for mobile gaming, while the 12.5-inch Razer Blade Stealth was named the "Best PC" at CES earlier this year for its combination of performance, value, expandability and portability. Both models recently announced refreshes that are shipping now. For more information on the new Razer Blade Pro, and to register to be notified about on-sale timing, visit razerzone.com/bladepro.

Grace Hopper organizers struggle to practice the diversity they advocate Posted Oct 20, 2016 by Megan Rose Dickey (@meganrosedickey) 0 SHARES Next Story The Nike Mag sneaker raffle raised $6.75 million for Parkinson’s research Advertisement The Anita Borg Institute, the organization responsible for the annual Grace Hopper Women in Computing Celebration taking place right now in Houston, has a problem with racial diversity and not practicing what it preaches, according to several current and former employees. These critics see this as problematic because ABI positions itself as a leader in efforts around diversity and inclusion in the tech industry. Aside from throwing this huge women in computing conference, ABI evaluates companies based on their gender diversity and parental leave policies, and works with partners like Google, HP and Intel to make the workplace more welcoming to women. But current and former employees say that ABI has lacked focus on people of color and leadership has been resistant or dismissive when asked to make inclusion of POC a priority. They have also said that the maternity leave policy at ABI is “abysmal.” That has left current and former employees questioning whether the organization is committed to including people of color and wondering when ABI will follow the same best practices it recommends to other companies. In the last year, there have been instances in which members of ABI’s leadership team have allegedly said that racial diversity is not a priority. Even though ABI’s slogan is “Measure what matters,” it’s not clear where racial diversity fits into the organization’s plans, according to my sources. One source told me that, at a marketing and organizational transformation meeting on June 17, 2016, a senior leader allegedly said that “race is not a priority metric for us to target or to measure.” A different source described their takeaway from that same meeting as being that women of color are not a priority in terms of event programming. To further highlight the organization’s issues around racial diversity, one person told me that a member of the board of trustees allegedly expressed that she didn’t know why “racial diversity was such a big deal” and didn’t understand why ABI had to focus on it or why it was necessary. “I do remember her saying it was a hassle,” the source told me. On a basic level, a current employee said, there is a discomfort when it comes to talking about race at the leadership and executive levels. When racial diversity comes up, that’s when some leaders start to stutter, this source said. “Senior leaders have a superficial understanding,” the source said. “They don’t want to get in the weeds of diversity as it relates to race and LGBTQIA people.” There is only one black person in a leadership role. That person is Rosario Robinson, who is the director of ABI communities. I asked Telle Whitney, the CEO of the Anita Borg Institute, about some of those comments made by certain members of ABI’s senior leadership team. “We have a great senior leadership team,” Whitney responded. “We’ve often talked about gender diversity and I’m not aware of anybody on my direct staff or actually in the company has ever, under any circumstances, [who] has said that diversity is not important. I know that sometimes we live in a fish bowl and sometimes comments can be misconstrued, but it’s certainly important to me and it’s a commitment we make to the organizations that we work with, but not just with diversity. We really are looking hard at what we’re telling companies to do and how do we take those lessons learned and move them into our staff development plans for the ABI.” She went on to say, “I don’t know who [from the leadership team] said that, but I don’t agree.”   For what it’s worth, my sources told me that Whitney was not present during those meetings and interactions. Still, some former and current employees are under the impression that senior leaders are not committed to racial diversity. So, in an attempt to clarify, I asked Whitney, “so, racial diversity is a priority?” “Diversity,” Whitney affirmatively said. “We don’t set targets, but we do have a very ethnically diverse staff and I do think it’s because we are welcoming to all kinds of different people.” ABI has never released a diversity report, but it plans to by the end of this year, Whitney told me. In terms of what it will entail, Whitney said, “for us, the biggest in terms of diversity is men. Because we work with women we actually only have a few men, but we also look at ethnic diversity. Our staff, we have about 10% African-Americans, about 7% Latino. What’s also important to us is age diversity.” It seems that having enough men on the team is more important than racial diversity. Using Whitney’s own words, it’s the “biggest in terms of diversity.” The Board of Trustees, for instance, has more men (10) than it does people of color (one). Shoutout to Aicha Evans of Intel, the sole black person on the Board of Trustees. “We can do better,” Whitney said. “There’s no question we can do better, but it has been in the focus area and we have seen some changes and we expect to see more. It’s interesting on our board because of our model, we actually have people come from different companies so you’re balancing trying to find the right position at those companies but also ensuring that we have diversity.” Meanwhile, ABI’s maternity policy is not up to snuff. Whitney confirmed that the ABI does not have a parental policy in place. Instead, those who need to take leave due to a pregnancy need to go on disability. “ABI has an abysmal maternity leave policy, and it ranks companies (through its Top Companies program) on paternity leave policies,” Brianne Huntsman, a now-former content curator and social media specialist at the ABI told me. “ABI is announcing the top companies award winner at GHC, and it is so hypocritical, given its own policies.” Whitney says that ABI is small enough that it hasn’t needed to put in an official policy. Though, she went on to say, “it’s certainly something that we expect to look at.” As Huntsman noted, ABI puts out a yearly ranking of the top tech companies for women. That ranking is based on things like maternity and paternity leave policies, flexible time, pay equity, accountability for gender diversity and leadership development programs. “They wouldn’t qualify for their own leadership index,” another former employee told me. “They can’t eat the food that they’re demanding everybody else eat.” Ultimately, there’s a lack of cohesive thought and intention around efforts of diversity and inclusion at the organization, a current employee said. ABI simply doesn’t have plans or action-oriented goals around the inclusion of LGBTQIA people and people of color. “The sentiment in general was we don’t practice what we preach, especially in our studies, research, papers and research that we promote,” one former employee told me. “Yet, we had a program to help companies re-develop their culture in a way that was more inviting for communities, but we didn’t even test that or practice what we preached within. There was a lot of that when I left. A lot of folks were not surprised that I was leaving, but surprised that it was so short.” Related Articles Palantir says it didn't racially discriminate against Asian people Salesforce's shift into equality Tech companies like TaskRabbit are engaged in affirmative action, and that’s ok ABI is also suffering from turnover, according to a source. Whitney confirmed that there has been a lot of turnover at the organization over the past year, and contributed it to the 50% growth in employees from the end of 2014. “I come from the world of startups,” Whitney said. “And that kind of growth in that small of a company is hard. There’s just nothing easy about it. We’ve made some mistakes. There’s no question we’ve made some mistakes.” One mistake, for example, is that ABI hasn’t internally applied the learnings from the training they provide to companies. Whitney said the organization hasn’t moved fast enough to put things like staff training and management training in place. Last year at Grace Hopper, not a single black woman was included as a headline speaker, but they were able to make room for two white men as special guest speakers. The conference did feature Janet George, Chief Data Scientist at SanDisk (who a source tell me was a last-minute addition) and Maxine Williams, Chief Diversity Officer at Facebook — both women of color — as panelists or plenary speakers, not headline speakers.  Whitney referenced last year in our chat, saying that “one of the things that came up last year were some pretty good and important comments from our community about our diversity for the conference overall, so we took those comments seriously.” This year, women of color are making up 30% of the speakers on the main stage, Whitney said. On Friday, for example, the “What Are Tech Tools Doing That the Best Diversity Initiative’s Aren’t” features one Latina person and one black woman. It’s also moderated by Slack engineer Erica Baker. Baker, who is black, was one of the first people to call out the Grace Hopper conference last year for its lack of racial diversity on stage. “I have mixed feelings about being here in general just because the conference itself still isn’t diverse,” Baker told me on day one of Grace Hopper. “It still has a white dude speaking as the keynote speaker.” Baker was referring to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who is giving the keynote on Friday. “He’s literally taking up space,” Baker said. “And that ABI allows him to do that and empowers him to do that feels kind of gross.” But ABI didn’t completely whiff in terms of keynote speakers. One of the keynote speakers on day one of GHC was Dr. Latanya Sweeney, a black professor in government and technology at Harvard University and founder of the Data Privacy Lab. ABI also honored three black women. Whatever reluctance there is to include women of color on the leadership team hasn’t stopped the organization from including women of color in its event programming. “It’s marketing,” a source said in regards to the event kicking off with Dr. Sweeney. “It needs to be authentic. They can’t even put [diversity] in their own organization. It’s inauthentic.” Featured Image: TechCrunch/MRD 0 SHARES Featured Stories June Intelligent Oven Review VIDEO | 4:50 | Reviews This is why Snapchat didn’t give Spectacles to techies 7 hours ago | Josh Constine Chinese scientists CRISPR a human for the first time 8 hours ago | Sarah Buhr Snapchat has reportedly filed confidentially for its massive IPO 10 hours ago | Matthew Lynley DJI’s Inspire 2 gets a second camera for first-person video feeds 11 hours ago | Brian Heater Latest From TechCrunch Samsung’s latest acquisition could pave the way for its own iMessage-type service 20 minutes ago | Jon Russell Former Twitter India head joins Times Internet to lead its global partnerships business 41 minutes ago | Jon Russell “Anti-smartphone” Light Phone runs into delays 2 hours ago | Haje Jan Kamps Crunch Report | Facebook’s Fake News Problem 2 hours ago | Khaled "Tito" Hamze Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe Advertisement Comment moderation powered by Up Next The Nike Mag sneaker raffle raised $6.75 million for Parkinson’s research Posted Oct 20, 2016 CrunchBoard Job Listings Director, Software Security @ Practice Fusion at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Developer at CastleBranch (Wilmington, NC, United States) Infrastructure Engineer Tango at The Sourcery (Mountain View, CA, United States) Senior Software Engineer @ Pared at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Software Engineer @ Pared at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2016 AOL Inc.

Needs Yahoo!

(NYSE:VZ) has been busy trying to decide how it was going to handle its now uncertain acquisition of Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO), it has still been running a telco business. Last quarter’s results remind us why Verizon is seeking out such a growth opportunity. Although the reported per-share earnings figure topped estimates, that was the only real “win” for the report. VZ stock fell in response, and understandably so. Source: Via Flickr In its recently completed third fiscal quarter of 2016, VZ earned an operating profit of $1.01 per share, and reported revenue of $30.94 billion. Analysts were expecting income of only 99 cents per share on $31.09 billion worth of revenue. For the third quarter of 2015, the company earned $1.04 per share of Verizon stock on sales of $33.16 billion. Verizon stock had topped earnings estimates in five of the prior six quarters, making this the sixth beat of the last seven. The bar had been set relatively low for most of those quarters though. Operating income for Q3 came in at $6.5 billion, while operating margins were 21.1%. Non-GAAP EBITDA reached $10.5 billion, while non-GAAP EBITDA margin came in at 33.9% for the quarter. 7 Stocks That Will Hit the Skids by Christmas CEO Lowell C. McAdam commented: “Verizon continues to deliver strong financial and operational results in highly competitive markets while positioning itself for future growth. While we transform our company in a challenging environment, we have maintained the financial flexibility to invest in our industry-leading networks to better serve customers, add scale to bring innovation to the mobile media and Internet of Things (IoT) markets, and increase dividends for a 10th consecutive year.” Verzion Earnings Show It Still Needs Yahoo Verizon was the winning bidder for struggling web company Yahoo, offering $4.8 billion for the company’s web properties in July of this year. That offer excludes the company’s stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) and Yahoo Japan, which make up the bulk of Yahoo’s value at this time. Although most everyone agrees Yahoo needs plenty of work to become the powerhouse it used to be, in the right hands it could return to its previous greatness. VZ acquired Yahoo rival AOL last year and has already shown forward progress with the newly bought property. With Yahoo in the mix, even more synergies could be achieved. A deal with Yahoo would also give Verizon access to web users who may also be interested in Verizon’s digital video ambitions like Go90 or even a so-called “skinny” cable television bundle that it has expressed interest in before. AOL’s video presence was a key reason Verizon nabbed it in 2015. Now though, VZ may back of out the Yahoo deal. In September, it was revealed that Yahoo didn’t disclose a major data breach that occurred in 2014. The company has also quietly been working with law enforcement officials, taking measures that some would say is a violation of privacy. Both gaffes damage the Yahoo brand, adding to the burden Verizon stock will bear if it goes through with the deal. Revenue Headwind for Verizon Stock VZ stock can certainly use the added revenue. While it’s still a cash cow, it has not been a growth machine in a while. Revenue for the prior three quarters has effectively been flat on a year-over-year basis, and earnings growth hasn’t been much more impressive. A saturated wireless and television market in conjunction with a decreasing need for landlines are the culprit for that stagnation, leaving wireless subscriber market share as the only sizeable growth engine. Wireline revenue fell 2.3% to $7.8 billion.

So What? No major surprises can only be a good thing for the recovering natural gas pipeline operator By James Brumley, InvestorPlace Feature Writer  |  Oct 20, 2016, 9:45 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: 10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in 2017 The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2016 10 Stocks to Buy If Donald Trump Becomes President Recent Posts: Why Nokia Corp (ADR) (NOK), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR) (TEVA) and Home Depot Inc (HD) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Stock Owners Should Ask Tougher Questions Target Corporation (TGT) Stock Holders Are in for a Wild Wednesday View All Posts Kinder Morgan Inc (NYSE:KMI) may have technically booked a loss of 10 cents per share for its recently ended third quarter, but its distributable cash flow of 48 cents per share of KMI stock on $3.33 billion worth of revenue was more than enough to pay for the 12.5 cent quarterly dividend the company intends to pay shareholders in early November. The difference will continue to support the ongoing improvement of the company’s financial situation. Source: Roy Luck via Flickr Analysts were collectively calling for earnings of 16 cents per share on revenue of $3.47 billion. Both numbers were lower than the year-ago distributable income of 19 cents per share of KMI stock and sales of $3.71 billion. The midstream pipeline (mostly natural gas) operator earned 15 cents per share in its second fiscal quarter of the year. President and CEO Steve Kean commented: “We had a good third quarter and once again, we demonstrated the resiliency of our cash flows, generated by a large, diversified portfolio of predominantly fee-based assets. We generated a loss per common share for the quarter of $0.10, primarily as a result of non-cash charges discussed below. That said, we produced distributable cash flow of $0.48 per share relative to our $0.125 per share dividend, resulting in $801 million of excess distributable cash flow above our dividend.” KMI Stock: Putting a Lid on Costs The company has been, and continues to be, diligent about containing costs, only focusing on projects that offer strong ROIs. Kean said after the release of Q2’s results that the company’s backlog stands at $13.5 billion worth of projects. That figure has since been whittled down to $13 billion as the company completed some work during the quarter. 7 Tech Stocks That Will Ride Healthcare to Riches But it’s still finding plenty of good ones. In the statement delivered with last quarter’s numbers, the company expects its current backlog to generate an average capital-to-Ebitda multiple of approximately 6.5. RBC Capital Market recently noted its backlog of projects should lead to revenue growth, funding the firm’s expectations of $1 worth of dividends per share of KMI stock in 2018. The current annualized dividend payout is 50 cents per share. RBC expects the natural gas company to continue raising its dividend, considerably, through 2020 when it could reach $2 per share. It’s easier for Kinder Morgan to complete lucrative projects than its smaller peers, as it’s able to leverage its size and build new pipelines more cost effectively. Capitalization Progress In early October, Stifel downgraded KMI stock from a “buy” to a “hold” after a runup had pushed the value of KMI stock up 50% for the year. Analyst Selman Akyol explained “While Kinder Morgan’s natural gas dominated asset base and improving balance sheet remain attractive, we believe the current valuation largely reflects the positive attributes of the KMI story. As a result, we are downgrading shares of KMI to Hold.” That balance sheet improved in the meantime, with long-term debt pulling back to $36.7 billion versus $40.6 billion a year earlier and $38 billion a quarter ago. Debt levels remain uncomfortably high, however, while the company continues to decrease its debt leverage. At the end of the second quarter Kinder Morgan’s net-debt-to-Ebitda pulled back to 8.8 — the first decrease for the prior seven quarters. Last quarter marks the second quarter of net-debt reduction, and there’s another $750 million already earmarked to lower debt levels for the quarter currently underway. Moody’s recently projected that Kinder Morgan would continue to whittle down the debt-Ebitda ratio down to 5.4 by the end of next year, restoring creditworthiness and access to new funding sources … if needed. Its plans, though, broadly steer the company away from taking on more debt. Chairman Richard Kinder plainly stated “We do not expect to need to access the capital markets to fund our growth projects for the foreseeable future beyond 2016.” Kinder added, “We are ahead of our plan for 2016 year-end leverage and we’re pleased with the progress toward reaching our targeted leverage level of around 5.0 times net debt-to-Adjusted Ebitda.” It should be at 5.3 by the end of the year.

Intel CEO Brian Krzanich Copyright Ethan Miller, Getty Images Advertisement Intel Corp.’s (IW 500/20) fight to overturn a record 1.06 billion euro (US$1.16 billion) European Union antitrust fine received a boost from an adviser to the bloc’s top court in a case that could have ramifications for a growing list of disputes involving U.S. tech giants from Google to Apple Inc. Intel’s appeal should be totally reviewed by a lower court, which was wrong to rule against the company’s system of rebates, Advocate General Nils Wahl of the EU Court of Justice said in a non-binding opinion Thursday. The top court will decide whether to back his views in a ruling expected within about six months. The lower tribunal was wrong to single out “exclusivity rebates” paid to customers who bought most or all of their chips from Intel, he said. The General Court’s analysis failed to show that the rebates harmed competition. The European Commission in Brussels declined to comment.

The Intel ruling may also have affect the EU’s handling of probes into Google and Qualcomm Inc. that could ultimately lead to fines. Intel’s 2009 antitrust fine was the EU’s biggest, more than double the 497 million-euro penalty against Microsoft Corp. in 2004. It represented about 4% of Intel’s $37.6 billion in sales in 2008, below the maximum penalty of 10% of yearly sales regulators can impose. While urging a review of the case, Wahl didn’t criticize the size of the fine, saying Intel failed to prove the amount was disproportionate. The EU’s eight-year investigation found that Intel impeded competition by giving rebates to computer makers from 2002 until 2005 on the condition that they buy at least 95% of chips for PCs from Intel. Intel raises restructuring charge to $2.3B, beats with Q3 sales of $15.8B, EPS $0.80 https://t.co/CTp90JKLFj — TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) October 19, 2016 The EU regulator said Intel imposed “restrictive conditions” for the remaining 5%, supplied by Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which struggled to overcome Intel’s hold on the market for processors that run PCs. Acer Inc., Dell Inc., Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo Group Ltd. and NEC Corp., were among computer firms coaxed to use Intel chips, the commission said in 2009. The ordered Intel to stop using illegal rebates to thwart competitors, an instruction that Intel complained was unclear. Qualcomm Eyes Intel Case Qualcomm will be watching the Intel case as it battles EU allegations that it paid an unidentified phone manufacturer to use its chipset. It will defend itself next month at a closed-door hearing examining a second set of charges that it sold chips below-cost to harm a smaller rival. Wahl was critical of the EU’s handling of evidence it gathered against Intel, saying the lower court was wrong to say regulators could add details of a meeting with a Dell executive long after the fact. Any ruling on this point may echo challenges that Ireland and Apple are preparing against the process leading up to the EU’s tax decision in August. The appeals may argue that EU regulators unfairly kept them in the dark during the probe and neglected to flag a shift in emphasis in the investigation, people with knowledge of their case have said. Sunnyvale, Calif.-based AMD, which initiated the EU antitrust case, is no longer involved in the case and didn’t intervene in the EU court hearings.

This product is optimized for custom network applications such as inline packet processing using TOE (TCP/IP Offload) and line speed algorithmic trading. The DNPCIE_80G_A10_LL joins a long list of FPGA-based network-targeted products from DINI Group, the industry’s established leader in large FPGA platforms. The DNPCIE_80G_A10 is a half-height PCIe board with a single Arria-10 FPGA, three banks of DDR4 memory, and a single bank of QDRII+ memory. For the FPGA, the DNPCIE_80G_A10_LL employs the high I/O-count, 1152-pin, flip-chip F34 BGA package. The Arria- 10 family of FPGAs contains high-speed transceivers capable of 12.5Gb/s without the need for an external PHY. Eight of these transceivers are used for an 8-lane GEN3 PCIe interface. Two sets of four of the high-speed transceivers are connected to QSFP+ sockets for two 40GbE Ethernet ports or up to 8 channels of 10 GbE. One of seven possible Arria-10 FPGAs can be stuffed (largest to smallest): GX1150, GX900, GX660, GX570, GX480, GX320, GX270. The SX variation that contains the embedded Dual-core ARM® Cortex®-A9 MPCoreTM processor is also an option. Those device options are SX660, SX570, SX480, SX320, SX270.

TRENDING NOW: Watch Dogs 2 first impressions Home News CPU, APU & Chipsets Core i7-7700K hits 6.7GHz on LN2, i5-7600K 5.1GHz on air Intel's new Kaby Lake leaks tease 6.7GHz clock speed for Core i7-7700K on LN2 cooling By: Anthony Garreffa | CPU, APU & Chipsets News | Posted: Oct 20, 2016 12:36 am Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Intel's next generation Kaby Lake architecture has been teased, but we haven't seen CPUs in the wild just yet - even though there are countless leaks on the new Core i7-7700K, and the latest one is the best.     The upcoming Core i7-7700K has been overclocked on a 100-series motherboard, with it hitting 6.7GHz thanks to LN2 cooling - and considering its stock 4.2/4.5GHz clocks for base and boost, respectively - this is the fastest Core i7 CPU from the Kaby Lake family.     HKEPC is behind the Core i7-7700K overclocked to 6.7GHz, where he used an ASRock Z170M OC Formula motherboard and GALAX HOF DDR4 RAM. The multiplier on the 7700K was upped to x67, while the bus speed wasn't touched. We don't know what voltage was used, but with HKEPC using LN2, we're sure it was pretty high.     Intel's upcoming Core i5-7600K was also overclocked, hitting a very respectable 5.1GHz on air, all done on the ASUS Maximus VIII Gene motherboard by facebookHK. The multiplier was increased to x40, while the bus speed was adjusted slightly to 127.51MHz, and the voltage set to 1.504v.   Intel has used its latest 14nm+ process node, with 8MB of L3 cache and a TDP of 91W - we should expect the Core i7-7700K to fall somewhere around the $370 mark. Intel's more mid-range Core i5-7600K is a quad-core processor on the same 14nm+ node, with 3.8/4.0GHz+ clocks for base/boost, respectively - while it has 6MB of L3 cache and the same 91W TDP, the price will be lower at around $250.

Ecumenical News ecunews.com Home U.S. world Church Culture Belief Humanitarian Analysis Lifestyle Middle East Christians Europe's refugee crisis Venezuela Impasse Climate Change Education in South Africa Nov 16, 2016, Updated at 02:29 AM EST Home General iMac 2016 release date, specs rumors: To be introduced on Oct. 27 Apple event? Kristine Fernandez |Tuesday, October 18 2016 Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin it (Apple)Shown in the photo is the current iMac 27-inch variant. Rumor has it that Apple will launch the iMac 2016 later this month. Gadget enthusiasts have been waiting for another unveiling event for Apple's computers, especially the iMac. New reports reveal that there may be one on Thursday, Oct. 27. According to reports, Apple is holding a huge event on Oct. 27 where they will introduce the newest iterations of its PC lineup and that includes the artist's favorite — iMac. Although the rumored event is likely to unveil the new upgrades for the MacBook, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro laptops, there is still a possibility that the iMac will also be getting its newest version. As for the desktop computer's rumored specs, there are speculations that the iMac 2016 will come out with the new Intel Kaby Lake processing chip of the 7th Gen Intel Core i7 family. The desktop computer may also offer support for the USB 3.1, Display Port 1.2, and Thunderbolt 3. It is also possible that the chipset that will power the newest iMac is an AMD Zen to match with the Polaris 10 graphics card. This could be the tech giant's way of beefing up its graphics. There are also rumors that the computer may get an external flash drive and virtual reality (VR) technology support. Other specs predictions include that the iMac 2016 will boast a Retina 5K display. As for the chipset, it may be coupled with 32 GB of RAM and 2 TB of storage capacity. However, if Apple wants to release the new iMac with the Kaby Lake, it may not come out as soon as this month. The processing chip has not been widely produced yet. It is possible that the desktop will be introduced to the public on the mentioned date, but the release of the units may be scheduled later than expected. Apple remains tight-lipped about the launch of iMac or any of its computer line. Users will have to take these rumors with a grain of salt.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple and IBM have launched their First MobileFirst App for Education Called 'Watson Element' | Main | Rumor suggests that Apple may be attending the 2017 Mobile World Congress Event as an Exhibitor » October 19, 2016 Apple's Not-So-Secret Mac Event is on for Next Thursday Oct 27   The announcement for Apple's World Wide Developer Conference held in June was titled "Hello, WWDC16" and Apple's invitation for their October 27 event is interestingly called "Hello again." Whether that's a reference to another Siri announcement or just a reference to the event being the second for the year is unknown at this time. Though someone just sent in a comment that it's a reference to the original Mac. That would make the most sense considering the nature of the event. Is the 'Reinvention' of the iMac on the way?   The Mac event is expected to take place at or near Apple's Cupertino campus rather than in San Francisco, where the company held many recent events, including the iPhone 7 announcement.   It's going to be a busy week. Apple has its earnings report on Tuesday, then Microsoft is holding a Windows 10 hardware event in New York on Wednesday where we may see their first all-in-one PC debut to challenge the iMac and then finally Apple will take to the stage to finally refresh their MacBooks and more.   What can we expect from Apple? Bloomberg told us way back in August that we could expect to see a 5K standalone display to replace their now defunct Thurderbolt Display. The MacBook Air may get a refresh and we're likely to see a thinner MacBook Pro.   Apple will update the iMac and that could be interesting. Intel told us that 7th Generation desktop processors won't be launching until sometime in Q1 2017. According to Intel's Navin Shenoy, VP, GM Client Computing Group, the new processors will usher in the 'Immersive Internet Era." Will Apple pull off a coup and have the new processors ahead of schedule? Likely not, but it's one of those hopefuls that would be a genuiine surprise.   With or without a 7th gen processor, Apple could introduce USB-C and new GPU cards will be announced. Will AMD continue to get the nod from Apple with their new Polaris pushing VR Performance that we pointed to back in April?   The question left is whether Apple will push the display to 34" or even 38" (curved or not) or keep the 27" as their top model. Apple supposedly worked with LG on the new 5K display and in August they introduced some fantastic displays for gamers and professionals. Was it a hint of what's to come?   In May Patently Apple posted a report titled "MacBook Pro to Gain OLED, Touch ID & First-to-Market Mini-Display Function Key Bar." This is where all eyes will be on when the new MacBook is announced. This would be a nice leap for the holiday season and beyond. It would really be spmething refreshing and possibly exciting depending how it's implemented.   Am I hoping for a real surprise at this event. Of course I'm am, I'm always hoping that Apple will pull a new rabbit out of their hat. That's what we always hope for isn't it? We don't get many real suprises these days with rumors killing all the fun. But one of these days Apple may still be able to land a great punch that no one is expecting, like adding a next-gen 3D depth iSight camera to the iMac and introducing their Faceshift app to give us all something new to try out and have fun with. Or maybe even In-air gesturing – just don't hold your breath on that one for this year.   And lastly, maybe Apple will be bold enough to add a new Magic Trackpad with Apple Pencil capabilities. Apple was granted that patent in June so why not implement it now? What are they waiting for? You never know, it might be the time to get the Apple community pumped with something new again. We'll know next week and I'll cross my fingers.   If there anything that you're hoping to see at the event that we didn't list, please send in your comments below.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Intel agencies warn of strategy to trigger stampede in crowded places. Terror outfits planning a strike in Uttar Pradesh during the ongoing festive season and political events may have a different plan up their sleeves this time. According to intelligence agencies, there is information that instead of using explosives, terror groups may resort to rumour mongering in crowded places and trigger off stampede like the one that took place last week in Varanasi. “We have definite information that this could be the latest modus operandi of terror outfits. In Varan-asi, eyewitnesses claim that a rumour of the bridge cracking up led to the stampede. This kind of rumours trigger panic in crowded areas and many lives are lost without even firing a bullet,” said a senior official in an intelligence unit. Intelligence agencies are now sharing the information with security agencies and efforts are being made to ensure crowd management in political meetings, weekly markets and local fairs that attract huge crowds. “The Diwali markets, Chhat Puja, Dev Deepawali in Varanasi and the ongoing Dewa fair are events where people come in thousands and even the slightest provocation can lead to an ugly situation,” the official said. Police officials have suggested barricading and separate entry and exit points, but making people follow the rules strictly is a Herculean task, especially during the festival season. Intelligence sources said that according to their information, some of the rumours that could be used to trigger a stampede have been identified. “False information of a terror attack in another part of the city, caving in of steps on the ghats, sudden rise in water level, major fire caused by explosion and a bomb attack on a monument could be rumours that can create panic movement in the public,” the official said. He added that the local police had been asked to set up public address system in all such crowded places and keep a close eye on public movement. In event of any panic movement, the public address system should be used to convince the people that all is well. Another input received by intelligence agency is that terrorists could cut off fuel pipes of vehicles parked in parking lot, thereby allowing fuel to flow out freely. Even a small lighted matchstick can then trigger off a major explosion in the area. One such incident recently took place in the Civil hospital in Lucknow but an alert visitor smelt petrol and informed the hospital authorities after which the police was called in. The fuel pipes of about half a dozen cars and two dozen two wheelers were found cut and the entire area was sanitized and washed to remove traces of fuel. “This could have been a trial case though the local police blamed it on miscreants but just imagine if someone had thrown a matchstick at the site”, the official pointed out.

The uptick helped the major averages continue to regain ground after ending Monday's trading at their lowest closing levels in a month. The major averages ended the day in positive territory but well off their best levels of the day. The Dow rose 40.68 points or 0.2 percent to 18,202.62, the Nasdaq inched up 2.57 points or 0.1 percent to 5,246.41 and the S&P 500 edged up 4.69 points or 0.2 percent to 2,144.29. The modest strength on Wall Street came amid a sharp increase by the price of crude oil, with crude for November delivery surging up $1.31 to $51.60 a barrel, the closing level since July of 2015. The jump by the price of oil came following the release of a report showing an unexpected drop in weekly crude oil inventories. The report from the Energy Information Administration said crude oil inventories slumped by 5.2 million barrels last week compared to expectations for an increase of about 2.7 million barrels. Meanwhile, a notable decline by shares of Intel (INTC) limited the upside for the tech-heavy Nasdaq, with the semiconductor giant tumbling by 5.9 percent. The drop by Intel came after the company reported better than expected third quarter results but forecast fourth quarter revenues below analyst estimates. In U.S. economic news, the Commerce Department released a report before the start of trading showing that housing starts unexpectedly tumbled to their lowest level in well over a year in September. The Federal Reserve also released its Beige Book, a compilation of anecdotal evidence on economic conditions in the twelve Fed districts. The Beige Book said economic activity continued to expand during the reporting period from late August to early October, with most districts indicating a modest or moderate pace of expansion. Sector News Among energy stocks, oil service stocks showed a particularly strong move to the upside, resulting in a 2.6 percent jump by the Philadelphia Oil Service Index. Halliburton (HAL) posted a standout gain within the oil service sector after reporting an unexpected third quarter profit. Gold stocks also saw significant strength on the day, with the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index surging up by 2.8 percent. The strength in the sector came as gold for December delivery climbed $7 to $1,269.90 an ounce. Considerable strength was also visible among steel stocks, as reflected by the 1.7 percent gain posted by the NYSE Arca Steel Index. The gain lifted the index to a two-month closing high. Airline, banking, and networking stocks also saw notable strength on the day, while some weakness emerged among biotechnology stocks. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly higher on Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index edged up by 0.2 percent, while Australia's All Ordinaries Index climbed by 0.5 percent. However, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index bucked the uptrend and fell by 0.4 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets moved to the upside on the day after seeing initial weakness. While the German DAX Index inched up by 0.1 percent, the French CAC 40 Index and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index both rose by 0.3 percent. In the bond market, treasuries showed a lack of direction throughout the session before closing roughly flat. Subsequently, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, crept up by less than a basis point to 1.752 percent. Looking Ahead Trading on Thursday may be impacted by some key economic data, including reports on weekly jobless claims, existing home sales, and Philadelphia-area manufacturing activity. On the earnings front, American Express (AXP), eBay (EBAY), and Mattel (MAT) are among the companies releasing their quarterly results after the close of today's trading. American Airlines (AAL), Travelers (TRV), Union Pacific (UNP), and Verizon (VZ) are also due to report their results before the start of trading on Thursday. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com The Most Influential Books In Business Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America More Commentary -Global European Shares Seen Extending Gains Sensex, Nifty Pare Early Gains Asian Markets In Positive Territory Sensex, Nifty Seeking Rebound After Selloff Higher Open Called For Thai Stock Market Indonesia Stock Market May Snap Losing Streak Additional Support Expected For Hong Kong Shares Renewed Support Tipped For China Bourse Taiwan Stock Market May Snap Losing Streak Singapore Bourse Likely To Crack Resistance At 2,800 Points Malaysia Market May Extend Tuesday's Gains South Korea Shares May Find Traction On Wednesday Stocks Close Mostly Higher Following Upbeat Retail Sales Data - U.S. Commentary Major Averages Remain Mixed In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary European Markets Finish Mostly Higher, But Little Changed Overall <<Previous        58 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Snapchat Parent Confidentially Initiates IPO Process Amazon Switching From Wrapping Paper To Reusable Bags Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Home Depot Lifts FY EPS View In Line With Market As Q3 Results Top Estimates Vodafone Slips To Pre-Tax Loss On Hefty India Charge; Narrows FY View Merck KgaA Lifts FY16 Earnings View As Q3 Results Climb, Stock Up Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone Amaya Gets Huge Buyout Bid From Former CEO Zuckerberg: Facebook Hoax News Did Not Get Trump Elected Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Siemens To Buy Mentor Graphics For $4.5 Bln Enterprise Value AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet ANTH Plunges As Lupus Trial Fails, BMY's Opdivo Is At It Again, FDA Nod For GILD FDA Snubs DVAX, Keep An Eye On OCUL, It's All Green For BLUE United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Nokia Sets Financial & Strategic Targets; Remains Focused On Cost Saving Program Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Upgrade: Steel Stocks In For Trump Renaissance Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy AAA: Low Gas Prices Drive Spike In Thanksgiving Travel Facebook Says Stops Allowing Ads To Target Ethnic Groups United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars Erickson Says Bankruptcy Court Approves Interim DIP Financing Sumitomo Electric Starts Operation Of CPV Power Generation Plant In Morocco Allianz Group Q3 Profit Climbs; Confirms 2016 Operating Profit Outlook NTT H1 Profit Up, Sales Down; Lifts FY Profit View, Cuts Sales Forecast Bechtle Q3 Profit Rises; Outlook For Year Adjusted Upwards Innogy 9-month Profit Declines; Confirms Forecast - Quick Facts SIG 4-Month Revenues Rise, LFL Revenues Down; CEO Stuart Mitchell Steps Down Konami Q2 Profit Rises, Revenues Down - Quick Facts ANTH Plunges As Lupus Trial Fails, BMY's Opdivo Is At It Again, FDA Nod For GILD Copyright © 2016 RTTNews.

Brent crude settled up 1.9 percent and U.S. crude settled up 2.6 percent after touching a 15-month high following a government report that showed a sharp drop in domestic inventories for the sixth week in seven. The energy sector rose 1.4 percent, its biggest gain in seven sessions. A 4.2-percent rise in Halliburton also provided a boost after the world's No.2 oilfield services provider posted third-quarter results. Morgan Stanley gained 1.9 percent after posting a better-than-expected quarterly profit to round out a string of solid results from big U.S. banks. The financial sector has risen in three of the past four sessions for a 1.7 percent advance. "We're up because the (earnings) numbers are so great, the forward guidance is great and the banks just knocked it out of the park," said Ken Polcari, Director of the NYSE floor division at O'Neil Securities in New York. "In the end, this quarter of earnings will not be negative, they will be slightly positive after it is all said and done." A disappointing revenue forecast from Intel capped the advance on Wall Street, however. The chipmaker tumbled 5.9 percent as the biggest drag on each of the three major indexes. The PHLX semiconductor index shed 0.45 percent. With 70 companies in the S&P 500 having reported earnings through Wednesday morning, 80 percent have topped earnings' expectations. Third quarter earnings are now expected to increase 0.5 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, which would be the first quarter of growth in five. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 40.68 points, or 0.22 percent, to 18,202.62, the S&P 500 gained 4.69 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,144.29 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.58 points, or 0.05 percent, to 5,246.41. The U.S. economy showed some signs of rising wage pressures in September and early October but overall compensation growth remained modest, the Federal Reserve said in its Beige Book report. The third and final U.S. presidential debate between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton is set to begin on Wednesday at 9 p.m. EDT (0100 GMT Thursday). Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.40-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.52-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 10 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 62 new highs and 56 new lows. About 5.97 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 6.45 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

The system is available now for $1099 from a number of retailers. The Acer Swift 7 (SF713-51-M90J) comes in a black and gold aluminum unibody to emphasize that the device is one of the premium products in the manufacturer’s lineup. The thickness of the laptop with a 13.3” FHD display covered with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 is 9.98 mm (0.39”), which is thinner than Apple’s MacBook as well as Dell’s Adamo XPS, both of which are renowned for their thin form factors. As for mass, the device weighs 1.12 kilograms (2.48 lbs), which is a tad heavier than the MacBook. Inside the Acer Swift 7 ultra-thin notebook there is an Intel Core i5-7Y54 processor (2C/4T, 1.2GHz/3.2GHz frequency, HD Graphics 615, 4.5 W), 8 GB of LPDDR3 RAM as well as a 256 GB SSD (the manufacturer does not specify whether it is an AHCI or NVMe). The laptop uses an 802.11ac Wi-Fi + BT 4.0 wireless adapter to communicate with the outside world wirelessly. The laptop also has a 720p webcam and two 5 Gbps USB 3.1 Type-C ports to connect peripherals, a display as well as for charging. Moving on to audio sub-system, we see a TRRS connector for headsets as well as two stereo speakers that are Dolby Audio certified. Acer Swift 7   SF713-51-M90J CPU SKU Core i5-7Y54 Base 1.2 GHz  Turbo 3.2 GHz  TDP 4.5 W GPU SKU Intel HD Graphics 615 (GT2) 24 EUs, Gen 9 Base 300 MHz Turbo 950 MHz  DRAM 8 GB LPDDR3 SSD 256 GB Display 13.3-inch 1920x1080 IPS LCD Ports 2 x USB 3.1 (Gen 1) Type-C 3.5mm combo jack Network 2x2:2 802.11ac with BT 4.0 Battery 2770 mAh (52.9 Wh?) Dimensions H: 0.39" W: 12.78" D: 9.04" H: 9.98 mm W: 32.46 cm D: 22.96 cm Weight 2.48 lbs (1.12 kg) Colors Gold and Black Price $1099.99 Since the Swift 7 is powered by Intel’s Kaby Lake, expect significantly improved video encoding/decoding capabilities, better GPU performance, as well as Speed Shift v2 technology. This should make the new machine to be generally faster and snapper than ultra-thin notebooks based on previous-gen CPUs. When it comes to battery life, Acer claims that the Swift 7 (SF713-51-M90J) has a 4-cell Li-Ion battery with 2770 mAh of capacity, which enables it to work for up to nine hours on one charge. Do note however that Acer does not specify conditions or workloads for that number. The Acer Swift 7 (SF713-51-M90J) notebook is available directly from Acer as well as from leading retailers (Amazon, Newegg, etc.) for $1099.99. It comes with a one-year warranty. Finally, keep in mind that Acer plans to release a family of Swift 7 notebooks, as it revealed at IFA. So expect to see further models of the Swift 7, including a more affordable version based on Intel’s Core i3 at $1000, as well as a more advanced system featuring Intel’s Core i7-7Y75 and a higher price.

POST A COMMENT 43 Comments View All Comments JoeyJoJo123 - Wednesday, October 19, 2016 - link >muh thinness I wish battery life had the supposed appeal that thinness has today. Reply Mr Perfect - Wednesday, October 19, 2016 - link What's especially irksome is this thinness is exactly what would enable larger batteries. If the internals of this laptop are this tiny, then throw them in a standard thickness case and fill the empty space with a massive battery. Reply Valantar - Thursday, October 20, 2016 - link ...and you'd have a six pound laptop with three-pound performance. Batteries are heavy (and not entirely cheap either). There's a reason why thin-and-lights/ultrabooks seem to have standardized around roughly 50Wh - with current hardware (and decent engineering) it's a decent compromise between longevity and mass. OTOH, I'd gladly have a 1,3kg laptop rather than a 1,1kg laptop if the only difference was 200g more battery. Reply Mr Perfect - Thursday, October 20, 2016 - link Well yes, you'd keep the weight reasonable. Pack in enough battery to get a real day long charge with actual use. Reply t.s - Thursday, October 20, 2016 - link 6 pound? what battery has that kind of weight? Car battery? Hyperbole too much? at last 4.5lbs and you can put like > 120Wh battery in a laptop. For mobile user that not using their notebook for serious work (video editing, 3D rendering, android programming, etc..), 50Wh battery is enough. But for people that tasking much their computer, it's not enough. Reply heffeque - Thursday, October 20, 2016 - link Who said anything about 6 pounds? *confused* Reply trulyuncouth - Saturday, October 22, 2016 - link Valantar said exactly that in the comment he was replying to. Reply damianrobertjones - Thursday, October 20, 2016 - link I remember using an Elitebook, all those years back, that featured a large slice battery and extended standard battery... MAX of 32 hours battery life. I started a video, on loop, but stopped it after 17 hours had passed with more than 50% battery remaining. Reply andychow - Sunday, October 23, 2016 - link I agree with you 100%. My most important criteria for a phone? Battery life. My most important criteria for a laptop? No moving parts and battery life. If you're a mobile person, you don't know when you can recharge or not. Reply MaidoMaido - Wednesday, October 19, 2016 - link I wish fully functional quad core CPU had more appeal than thinness and battery life, but the reality is most laptop buyers don't use demanding applications and the dual core low voltage crap processors are well and good enough for writing papers, checking facebook, emails, Netflix, etc. In my case, I travel frequently, but there is always an AC outlet nearby, so I don't care about battery life, and as long as it is at least 15" display or smaller, under 1.5 inches thick it is portable enough for me. I do need decent quad core CPU for work stuff though, and dedicated graphics in the range of GTX 1060 would be nice.

Comments By Lucian Constantin Follow IDG News Service | Oct 19, 2016 11:41 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Security Computer Hardware Computer Processors Application Security Comments A feature in Intel's Haswell CPUs can be abused to reliably defeat an anti-exploitation technology that exists in all major operating systems, researchers have found. The technique, developed by three researchers from State University of New York at Binghamton and the University of California in Riverside, can be used to bypass address space layout randomization (ASLR) and was presented this week at the 49th annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture in Taipei. ASLR is a security mechanism used by operating systems to randomize the memory addresses used by key areas of processes, so that attackers don't know where to inject their exploit shellcode. ASLR is used to prevent memory corruption bugs, such as stack and heap overflows, from arbitrary code execution as opposed to crashes. Once such a vulnerability is exploited, the malicious code needs to be injected at a position in memory where the target process or the OS kernel itself will execute as part of normal operation. In their paper, the three researchers show that the branch target buffer (BTB), a caching mechanism used by the CPU's branch target predictor, can be leveraged to leak ASLR addresses by triggering BTB collisions between different user processes or processes and the kernel. The branch prediction mechanism is used in modern CPUs to optimize performance. "The BTB stores target addresses of recently executed branch instructions, so that those addresses can be obtained directly from a BTB lookup to fetch instructions starting at the target in the next cycle," the researchers explain in their paper. "Since the BTB is shared by several applications executing on the same core, information leakage from one application to another through the BTB side-channel is possible." The researchers demonstrated their BTB-based ASLR bypass on a computer equipped with an Intel Haswell microarchitecture CPU and running a recent Linux kernel (version 4.5). Their attack can reliably recover kernel ASLR using BTB collisions in around 60 milliseconds. The research paper proposes both software and hardware-based mitigations that could prevent BTB-based side-channel attacks in the future or harden current ASLR implementations. Attackers currently have other methods of bypassing ASLR, but they typically require finding additional memory leak vulnerabilities and chaining those together with the original memory corruption flaw. Due to software security improvements in recent years, most remote code execution attacks today require the use of chained exploits. Intel didn't immediately respond to a request for comments.

Oil prices were up more than 2 percent, with U.S. crude touching a 15-month high after the government reported a sharp drop in domestic inventories for the sixth week in seven. The energy sector jumped 2 percent, the most in three weeks, with a 5.2 percent rise in Halliburton also providing a boost after the world's No.2 oilfield services provider posted third-quarter results. Morgan Stanley gained 1.8 percent after posting a better-than-expected quarterly profit to round out a string of solid results from big U.S. banks. The financial sector has risen in three of the past four sessions for a 1.8 percent advance. "We've seen earnings kind of trough, we are going to see better earnings and we are going to start to move from the negative overall into the positive this quarter and next," said Jeff Kravetz, regional investment director at the Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank in Phoenix, Arizona. A disappointing revenue forecast from Intel capped the advance on Wall Street, however. The chipmaker tumbled 6.1 percent as the biggest drag on each of the three major indexes. The PHLX semiconductor index shed 0.45 percent. With 70 companies in the S&P 500 having reported earnings through Wednesday morning, 80 percent have topped earnings' expectations. Analysts now estimate earnings increased 0.5 percent in the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, which would be the first quarter of growth in five. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 70.27 points, or 0.39 percent, to 18,232.21, the S&P 500 gained 7.07 points, or 0.33 percent, to 2,146.67 and the Nasdaq Composite added 5.86 points, or 0.11 percent, to 5,249.70. The U.S. economy showed some signs of rising wage pressures in September and early October but overall compensation growth remained modest, the Federal Reserve said in its Beige Book report. The third and final U.S. presidential debate between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton is set to begin on Wednesday at 9 p.m. EDT (0100 GMT Thursday). Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.13-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.80-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 10 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 58 new highs and 48 new lows.

The technique works on almost every operating system and enables more effective software exploits. The researchers behind the discovery developed a bypass for Intel's Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) technology on its Haswell series of processors. As Ars Technica reports, the flaw was demonstrated at the IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture in Taipei, Taiwan, on Tuesday. ASLR is a processor-level defence against cyberattacks that attempt to install malware on a computer by exploiting operating system vulnerabilities. When you launch a program on a computer, it's loaded into memory. Traditionally, programs were loaded sequentially, creating predictable patterns that attackers could use to identify running programs and extract data from them. ASLR randomises the locations where code is stored in memory. This prevents malware from working out where data is stored as there is no apparent logic to the contents of any given memory chip. The effect of any successful exploit can be limited to a software crash, as opposed to control of the entire system. The researchers discovered ASLR isn't infallible though. A flaw in Intel's processors makes it possible to bypass the technology. With ASLR effectively turned off, malware becomes much more powerful. Attacks that would usually be stopped by the technology can incur serious consequences. The malware that would usually cause a crash could cause a total system compromise. The flaw was found in the CPU's branch predictor, a system that speeds up memory operations by anticipating where soon-to-be-executed instructions are located. In more relatable terms, the branch predictor is able to realise that if a "folder" of addresses is accessed then the "files" within are likely to be retrieved in the near future. It stores references to these additional memory locations ahead of time, speeding up subsequent operations. The researchers' program is able to use the data stored in the branch predictor's tables to determine the memory addresses where chunks of code are loaded. By causing collisions in the branch predictor that impact the timing of the attacking program, the malware can work out the locations of known branch instructions. Once that information has been obtained, traditional memory modification techniques can be used to inject malicious code into the target program and compromise the system. This can be achieved in "about 60 milliseconds" on real Haswell processors running a recent version of Linux. The attack is also feasible on other operating systems. The researchers said the flaw exemplifies the need for chip manufacturers to take security into account when developing new designs. With ASLR disabled, an attacker could gain control of a victim app or an entire computer. Intel has not publicly commented on the findings. The company told Ars Technica it is "investigating" the research paper though. It is not clear whether it will be able to publish a patch for the issue.

James Passeri Oct 19, 2016 12:13 PM EDT Intel ( INTC) shares were lower Wednesday after the tech giant said fourth-quarter revenue may lag behind analyst expectations. Intel also said it now expects to see quarterly sales of about $15.7 billion vs. consensus forecasts of $16.1 billion. Meanwhile, third-quarter sales of $15.78 billion clocked in slightly above analyst forecasts of $15.58 billion. Meanwhile earnings also surpassed expectations; earnings of $0.80 a share topped consensus estimates by seven cents. Intel's CEO Brian Krzanich noted that the company has made meaningful progress in developing new technologies that could boost future top-line growth.

"I think that Intel was too negative about itself," Cramer said, adding that the company usually has a strong fourth quarter but Intel threw cold water on those expectations, causing investors to sell. "I would not give up on Intel." Intel's fourth quarter revenue guidance missed analysts' estimates. The company reported results after the closing bell on Tuesday.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Thu, Oct 20, 2016 - Page 11　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Intel Q4 sales might miss estimates on PC doldrums SHRINKING MARKET:Worldwide PC shipments fell 3.9 percent in the third quarter, a smaller drop than the 4.1 percent in the second quarter, a market researcher said Bloomberg Intel Corp gave a disappointing forecast for sales this quarter, signaling lackluster year-end demand for PCs, servers and the chips that run them. Revenue would be US$15.7 billion, with a margin of error of US$500 million, the company said in a statement on Tuesday. Analysts had projected US$15.9 billion, the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg showed. Intel’s third-quarter sales reached a record, lifted by processor orders from PC makers that decided to shore up their chip supplies ahead of the holiday shopping season. So far, demand has not come surging back, meaning that customers will again pare orders as they work through those stockpiles of chips. The world’s largest semiconductor maker also backed off an annual forecast for double-digit revenue growth in server chips for data centers and corporate networks, its most profitable business. “We’re not going to raise the flag and say everything’s good again,” Intel chief executive officer Brian Krzanich said on a conference call. The company’s third-quarter net income rose to US$3.38 billion, or US$0.69 per share, compared with US$3.11 billion, or US$0.64 per share, in the same period last year. Revenue rose 9.1 percent to US$15.8 billion. Adjusted gross margin widened to 65 percent from 64 percent, Intel said. The company’s client computing group, which sells PC chips, posted third-quarter sales of US$8.89 billion, a gain of 4.5 percent from the same period last year. Demand for PCs will increase in the fourth quarter from the previous three months, in line with normal seasonal gains, the company said. While the PC market is not getting worse, it is still shrinking. Worldwide shipments fell 3.9 percent in the third quarter, market researcher International Data Corp said earlier this month, a smaller drop than the decline of 4.1 percent in the second quarter. Intel’s data-center group, which provides chips used in corporate networks and the large cloud-computing systems run by companies such as Google and Amazon.com Inc, posted revenue of US$4.54 billion, a year-on-year rise of 9.7 percent. The company had set an annual target of double-digit percentage growth for that unit — a prediction it missed in the first half. On Tuesday, Krzanich said the unit would only achieve “high single-digit” percentage sales growth for this year. Large customers who build their own servers have returned to ordering, with sales in the third quarter from cloud customers up 32 percent year-on-year, Intel said.

Currently, the major averages are posting modest gains on the day. The Dow is up 62.29 points or 0.3 percent at 18,224.23, the Nasdaq is up 1.71 points or less than a tenth of a percent at 5,245.54 and the S&P 500 is up 5.26 points or 0.3 percent at 2,144.86. The modest strength on Wall Street comes amid a sharp increase by the price of crude oil, with crude for November delivery surging up $1.41 to $51.70 a barrel. The price of crude oil reached a high of $51.93 a barrel earlier in the session, reflecting its highest level since July of 2015. The jump by the price of oil comes following the release of a report showing an unexpected drop in weekly crude oil inventories. The report from the Energy Information Administration said crude oil inventories slumped by 5.2 million barrels last week compared to expectations for an increase of about 2.7 million barrels. Meanwhile, a notable decline by shares of Intel (INTC) is limiting the upside for the tech-heavy Nasdaq, with the semiconductor giant tumbling by 6.1 percent. The drop by Intel comes after the company reported better than expected third quarter results but forecast fourth quarter revenues below analyst estimates. In U.S. economic news, the Commerce Department released a report before the start of trading showing that housing starts unexpectedly tumbled to their lowest level in well over a year in September. The Federal Reserve is scheduled to release its Beige Book later in the day, potentially shedding some additional light on the outlook for monetary policy. Sector News Among energy stocks, oil service stocks have shown a particularly strong move to the upside, resulting in a 3.2 percent jump by the Philadelphia Oil Service Index. With the gain, the index reached a nearly three-month intraday high. Halliburton (HAL) is posting a standout gain within the oil service sector after reporting an unexpected third quarter profit. Gold stocks are also seeing substantial strength in mid-day trading, with the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index surging up by 3.4 percent. The gains by gold stocks come amid an increase by the precious metal, as gold for December delivery is climbing $9.50 to $1,272.40 an ounce. Significant strength is also visible among steel stocks, as reflected by the 2 percent gain being posted by the NYSE Arca Steel Index. The gain has lifted the index to a two-month intraday high. Banking stocks are also seeing notable strength on the day, while most of the other major sectors are showing more modest moves. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly higher on Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index edged up by 0.2 percent, while Australia's All Ordinaries Index climbed by 0.5 percent. However, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index bucked the uptrend and fell by 0.4 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets moved to the upside on the day after seeing initial weakness. While the German DAX Index inched up by 0.1 percent, the French CAC 40 Index and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index both rose by 0.3 percent. In the bond market, treasuries have shown a lack of direction after moving higher over the two previous sessions. Subsequently, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is down by less than a basis point at 1.749 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com The Most Influential Books In Business Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America More Commentary -Global European Shares Seen Extending Gains Sensex, Nifty Pare Early Gains Asian Markets In Positive Territory Sensex, Nifty Seeking Rebound After Selloff Higher Open Called For Thai Stock Market Indonesia Stock Market May Snap Losing Streak Additional Support Expected For Hong Kong Shares Renewed Support Tipped For China Bourse Taiwan Stock Market May Snap Losing Streak Singapore Bourse Likely To Crack Resistance At 2,800 Points Malaysia Market May Extend Tuesday's Gains South Korea Shares May Find Traction On Wednesday Stocks Close Mostly Higher Following Upbeat Retail Sales Data - U.S. Commentary Major Averages Remain Mixed In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary European Markets Finish Mostly Higher, But Little Changed Overall <<Previous        58 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Snapchat Parent Confidentially Initiates IPO Process Amazon Switching From Wrapping Paper To Reusable Bags Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Home Depot Lifts FY EPS View In Line With Market As Q3 Results Top Estimates Vodafone Slips To Pre-Tax Loss On Hefty India Charge; Narrows FY View Merck KgaA Lifts FY16 Earnings View As Q3 Results Climb, Stock Up Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone Amaya Gets Huge Buyout Bid From Former CEO Zuckerberg: Facebook Hoax News Did Not Get Trump Elected Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Siemens To Buy Mentor Graphics For $4.5 Bln Enterprise Value AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet ANTH Plunges As Lupus Trial Fails, BMY's Opdivo Is At It Again, FDA Nod For GILD FDA Snubs DVAX, Keep An Eye On OCUL, It's All Green For BLUE United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Nokia Sets Financial & Strategic Targets; Remains Focused On Cost Saving Program Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Upgrade: Steel Stocks In For Trump Renaissance Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy AAA: Low Gas Prices Drive Spike In Thanksgiving Travel Facebook Says Stops Allowing Ads To Target Ethnic Groups United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars Erickson Says Bankruptcy Court Approves Interim DIP Financing Sumitomo Electric Starts Operation Of CPV Power Generation Plant In Morocco Allianz Group Q3 Profit Climbs; Confirms 2016 Operating Profit Outlook NTT H1 Profit Up, Sales Down; Lifts FY Profit View, Cuts Sales Forecast Bechtle Q3 Profit Rises; Outlook For Year Adjusted Upwards Innogy 9-month Profit Declines; Confirms Forecast - Quick Facts SIG 4-Month Revenues Rise, LFL Revenues Down; CEO Stuart Mitchell Steps Down Konami Q2 Profit Rises, Revenues Down - Quick Facts ANTH Plunges As Lupus Trial Fails, BMY's Opdivo Is At It Again, FDA Nod For GILD Copyright © 2016 RTTNews.

(AAPL), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) 2 Bullish Trades for Target Corporation (TGT) Stock Earnings View All Posts Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) is expected release its second-quarter earnings report near the middle of next week, and both Wall Street and options traders are leaning heavily bullish on BABA stock ahead of the event. Source: Charles Chan Via Flickr What’s more, options traders are pricing in a post-earnings move of only about 4% for Alibaba stock, which is well below historical levels for the shares, creating an opportunity for an earnings-related options trade. Digging into the numbers, Wall Street is looking for BABA stock to post a profit of 70 cents per share on revenue of $5.08 billion. While Alibaba has previously had trouble meeting expectations, last quarter marked a turnaround that should carry over into next week’s report. Wall Street certainly believes so, as Zacks data highlights 16 buy ratings for BABA, compared to just one hold and no sell ratings. There is room for improvement, however, as the 12-month consensus price target of $114.09 represents a modest premium of only about 9.8% to yesterday’s close. 7 Stocks to Buy That Will Grow by Double Digits Turning to the options pits, we find that speculative traders are just as bullish on BABA stock’s short-term prospects. Currently, the October/November put/call open interest ratio comes in at 0.37, with calls nearly tripling puts among options set to expire within the next two months. This ratio slips to 0.35 when we look at just the weekly October 28 series — i.e. those options most affected by next week’s earnings report. Click to Enlarge As I noted above, weekly October 28 series implieds are only pricing in a potential post-earnings move of about 4.18% — which is historically low for Alibaba stock ahead of earnings. This places the upper bound at $107.66, while the lower bound lies at $99.02 from Tuesday’s close. I would expect a post-earnings rally to push BABA to $110, if not above, while a decline should hold in the $98-$100 region. 2 Trades for BABA Stock Call Spread: With earnings less than a week away, BABA stock is in the process of rebounding off support in the $100 region. This pullback marks an excellent entry point for a long position ahead of earnings. As such, traders looking join the bullish bandwagon might want to consider a Nov $105/$110 bull call spread. At last check, this spread was offered at $1.82, or $182 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $106.82, while a maximum profit of $3.18, or $318 per pair of contracts, is possible if Alibaba stock closes at or above $110 when November options expire. Analysts Could Be Lovin’ McDonald’s Corporation (MCD) Stock Again Soon Put Sell: If you are concerned about broad-market headwinds, then a BABA put sell may be a more neutral path toward profit. At last check, the weekly Oct 28 series $98 put was bid at 33 cents, or $33 per pair of contracts. As long as BABA stock trades above $98 through expiration next Friday, traders pursuing this strategy will keep the $33 premium. However, if BABA trades below $98 ahead of expiration, you could be assigned 100 shares for each contract sold at a price of $98 per share. As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Stocks rise ahead of Fed's Beige Book; earnings, oil in focus CNBC 10/19/2016 Fred Imbert © REUTERS/Brendan McDermid A trader works on the floor of the NYSE Stocks traded higher on Wednesday, helped by better-than-expected earnings and rising oil prices, as investors braced themselves for a key Federal Reserve data release. The Dow Jones industrial average rose about 53 points, with Goldman Sachs and IBM contributing the most gains to the tune of 15 points and 9 points, respecively. That said, Intel shares dragged on the blue-chips index, shaving off 13 points. Quotes in the article eBay Inc EBAY ▲ 28.49 +0.60 +2.15% Core Laboratories NV CLB ▲ 108.25 +2.32 +2.19% Halliburton Co HAL ▲ 49.76 +1.62 +3.37% American Express Co AXP ▲ 72.47 +0.05 +0.07% The S&P 500 gained 0.2 percent, with energy rising more than 1 percent to lead advancers. The energy sector extended gains after the Energy Information Administration reported a 5.3 million crude oil drawdown. West Texas Intermediate futures for November delivery rose 2.41 percent to $51.50 per barrel. The Nasdaq composite hovered just above the flatline. The Fed is scheduled to release the latest iteration of its so-called Beige Book at 2 p.m. ET, which summarizes economic conditions in the U.S. The report is expected to garner more attention than usual as investors search for more clues about when the central bank will raise interest rates. "Some of the economic news we've gotten has been pretty mixed, but it's been mostly good," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. Cardillo added he expects the Fed to raise rates in December. Other economic data released Wednesday included housing start and permits for September. Housing starts fell 9 percent last month, but permits spiked 6.3 percent. Also, U.S. mortgage applications rose 0.6 last week, as higher rates did not deter buyers. "The bizarre plunge in multi family starts is inexplicable but the rise in permits says it was an outlier," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, in a note. Elsewhere in the economic calendar, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and New York Fed President William Dudley are both scheduled to speak Wednesday. San Francisco Fed President John Williams also spoke Wednesday, but did not comment on monetary policy. Meanwhile, earnings season carried on Wednesday, with eight of the 13 S&P components that posted results this morning beating Wall Street estimates, according to Nick Raich, CEO of The Earnings Scout. Morgan Stanley, Abbott Labs and BB&T were among the companies that exceeded expectations on both earnings per share and revenue. Morgan Stanley continued the trend of big banks beating forecasts on strong performances from trading. Dow component Intel also reported better-than-expected results Tuesday afternoon, but its stock fell more than 5 percent on light revenue guidance. Companies scheduled to report are eBay, American Express and Mattel, among others. U.S. stock futures traded flat to higher before the bell Wednesday amid the deluge of corporate reports and rising oil prices. Market participants will also keep an eye on the U.S. presidential election, with Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump scheduled to hold their third and final debate before the election. Clinton currently hold a double-digit lead over Trump, according to an NBC/ Wall Street Journalpoll released Sunday. "Tonight's debate offers Donald Trump one of his last opportunities to make a dent in the apparently insurmountable lead enjoyed by Hillary Clinton," said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities, in a note. "With the former Secretary of State starting to pack her bags for the White House, I doubt that the E-Minis will move much overnight during the broadcast." U.S. Treasurys were mixed, with the two-year note yield lower around 0.81 percent and the 10-year yield higher at 1.75 percent. The U.S. dollar traded flat to lower against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.096 and the yen around 103.3. Overseas, European stocks traded mostly higher, with the Stoxx 600 index rising 0.2 percent. In Asia, stocks closed mixed, with the Nikkei 225 rising 0.2 percent and the Hang Seng index falling 0.38 percent.

Revenue will be $15.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million, the company said in a statement Tuesday. Analysts had projected $15.9 billion, the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Intel’s third-quarter sales reached a record, lifted by processor orders from PC makers that decided to shore up their chip supplies ahead of the holiday shopping season. So far, demand hasn’t come surging back, meaning that customers will again pare orders as they work through those stockpiles of chips. The world’s largest semiconductor maker also backed off an annual forecast for double-digit revenue growth in server chips for data centers and corporate networks, its most profitable business. “We’re not going to raise the flag and say everything’s good again,” Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said on a conference call. Intel shares, which had gained 9.6 percent this year, slipped as much as 6 percent in extended trading on news of the reduced target for the data-center unit. The stock had gained 1.2 percent to $37.75 at the close in New York. Third-Quarter Pickup Third-quarter net income rose to $3.38 billion, or 69 cents a share, compared with $3.11 billion, or 64 cents, in the same period a year earlier. Revenue rose 9.1 percent to $15.8 billion. Analysts, on average, had predicted a profit of 67 cents a share on sales of $15.6 billion. Adjusted gross margin, or the percentage of sales left after subtracting production costs, widened to 65 percent from 64 percent, Intel said. The company’s client computing group, which sells PC chips, posted third-quarter sales of $8.89 billion, a gain of 4.5 percent from a year earlier. Demand for PCs will increase in the fourth quarter from the prior three months, in line with normal seasonal gains, the company said. “It’s my concern that we just have an inventory build that could carry on into the first quarter,” said Kevin Cassidy, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. “The market might have thought that PCs would be better into the fourth quarter.” On Sept. 16, Intel raised its forecasts for the third quarter, citing “replenishment of PC supply chain inventory.” The Santa Clara, California-based company increased its revenue projection at the time to about $15.6 billion from about $14.9 billion. While the PC market isn’t getting worse, it’s still shrinking. Worldwide shipments fell 3.9 percent in the third quarter, market researcher IDC said earlier this month, a smaller drop than the decline of 4.1 percent in the second quarter. Unit sales in the U.S. rose 1.7 percent, a second consecutive quarterly gain. Data Center Exclusive insights in your inbox, from our technology reporters around the world.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter Intel’s data-center group, which provides chips used in corporate networks and the large cloud-computing systems run by companies such as Google and Amazon.com Inc., had revenue of $4.54 billion, up 9.7 percent from a year earlier. The company had set an annual target of double-digit percentage growth for that unit -- a prediction it missed in the first half of the year. On Tuesday, Krzanich said the unit will only achieve “high single-digit” percentage sales growth for 2016. Large customers who build their own servers have returned to ordering, with sales in the third quarter from cloud customers up 32 percent from a year earlier, Intel said. That strength and solid demand from networking and storage systems customers was offset by the continuing stagnation of the market for servers used by corporations, the company said. “There’s some disappointment there,” said Stifel Nicolaus’s Cassidy.

Close share panel Image copyright Reuters (Close): US markets closed higher, with energy stocks lifted by rising oil prices. The Dow Jones rose 40.68 points to 18,202.62 while the wider S&P 500 edged up 4 points to 2,144.29. Oil prices rose over 2% after figures suggested a drop in US stockpiles. Shares in Chevron added 0.5% and Chesapeake Energy climbed 3.1%. The tech-focused Nasdaq rose just 2.6 points to 5,246.41, with Intel down nearly 6% after its latest results. Intel reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and revenue, but its shares were hit after its forecast for fourth-quarter revenues fell slightly short of expectations. Intel is predicting revenues of $15.7bn in the quarter, plus or minus $500m, compared with analysts' expectations of $15.86bn. Morgan Stanley shares rose 1.9% after the bank reported a 62% jump in third-quarter earnings to $1.5bn. Like the other major US investment banks, Morgan Stanley's results were boosted by a big increase in bond trading, with revenues from that activity rising to $1.5bn in the quarter from $583m a year earlier. Volumes of bond trading have been strong in recent months, partly due to the UK's vote to leave the EU and also due to speculation about moves in US interest rates.

As a result, some of the companies are showing interest in GNC Holdings Inc (NYSE: GNC), a specialty retailer focused on health and wellness products. According to a Wall Street Journal report, GNC has recently met with prospective buyers from China. The current market cap of the company is about $1.4 billion and has an estimated debt of close to $1.6 billion. Including the debt, the possible deal could be valued at about $4 billion. Companies' interest in health and wellness products is quite evident from the estimation provided by Euromonitor International Ltd. The firm expects the market for vitamins and dietary supplement to record a 53 percent jump to $28.7 billion in 2021. Chinese firms are showing more interest in Western brands as the people are losing confidence in the local brands following the scandals. Fosun Group and ZZ Capital International Ltd. have reportedly shown interest in GNC Holdings. Several pharmaceutical firms have also indicated their interest,  although it's not clear that such move could lead to the striking of the deal. Following the report, the stock traded up more than 8 percent to at $20.99. Posted-In: News Wall Street Journal Rumors M&A Media Trading Ideas General Best of Benzinga © 2016 Benzinga.com.

Intel fell 4.7 percent, the biggest drag on all three indexes, after the chipmaker's disappointing current-quarter revenue forecast. The news pulled the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index 1.1 percent lower. Oil prices rose 1.3 percent as the dollar eased and data showed Chinese output dropped while U.S. inventories shrunk. The energy sector's 1.01 percent rise was the most among the 11 major S&P 500 indexes, also boosted by Halliburton's 3 percent jump following its surprise quarterly profit. Morgan Stanley rose 1.7 percent after its quarterly profit and revenue beat consensus estimates, rounding off a strong quarter for big U.S. banks. Fellow investment bank Goldman Sachs was up 1.3 percent. At 9:43 a.m. ET (1343 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 27.46 points, or 0.15 percent, at 18,189.4. The S&P 500 was up 0.22 points, or 0.01 percent, at 2,139.82 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 7.73 points, or 0.15 percent, at 5,236.10. Five of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower. Consumer staples fell the most, by 0.77 percent. The sector was dragged down by tobacco company Reynolds American, which fell 4 percent as its results missed estimates. Through Tuesday, earnings from S&P 500 companies had largely beaten market expectations, putting them on track to post profit growth for the first time in five quarters. Analysts now estimate earnings increased 0.2 percent in the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. While investors assess the flood of corporate earnings reports, they also await the Federal Reserve's Beige Book at noon, which will contain commentary on economic health. The third and final U.S. presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton starts later in the evening. A Clinton presidency would be more positive for the markets as her positions are more well known than those of Trump, according to a Reuters poll. Among earnings, pipeline operator Kinder Morgan and payments processor American Express will issue results after the close. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,643 to 965. On the Nasdaq, 1,140 issues rose and 1,091 fell. The S&P 500 index showed five new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 16 new highs and 21 new lows.

Intel reported non-GAAP EPS of $0.80, higher than consensus’ $0.73 and generated revenue of $15.8 billion, also topping Street view of $15.58 billion. However, the company guided fourth-quarter revenue of $15.7 billion + / - $500 million versus consensus of $15.86 billion as the company cut its Enterprise server outlook and added some caution for PCs into year-end. Intel now sees Enterprise down versus flat and expects lower PC demand. “The server miss will likely disappoint but PC declines are slowing and even at the lower rate server are still up double digits in the 2H, which should continue in 2017,” analyst Blayne Curtis wrote in a note.

This implies proforma EPS of $0.73 slightly below consensus $0.77. “A disappointment given our recent upgrade, but the thesis is unchanged as we still see this as an improving growth story as PCs become the minority of revenue and servers still grow even with a down Enterprise market,” Curtis continued. To reflect weak fourth-quarter guide, Curtis trimmed expectations for CY16 revenue/EPS to $58.73 billion/$2.66 (prior $59.14 billion/$2.65), and CY17 moves to $61.86 billion/$2.83 (prior $62.36 billion/$2.93). Shares of Intel closed Tuesday’s trading at $37.75. In the pre-market hours Wednesday, the stock fell 4.85 percent to $35.92. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 19, 2016 8:25am   Comments Share: Related INTC 3 Stocks To Own Under President Trump Big Tech Is Leading The Stock Market Higher Today George Soros Buys Oil, Emerging Markets and 'Old Tech' in 'rd Quarter (GuruFocus) Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) reported its Q3:16 results with a mild beat to expectations, while issuing its Q4:16 guidance below the consensus forecasts. Goldman Sachs’ Toshiya Hari maintains a Neutral rating on the company, while lowering the price target from $39 to $36. Disappointing Guidance For Q3:16, Intel reported revenue of 15,779 million, 1 percent above the consensus and estimate, with GAAP EPS of $0.69, which was ahead of the consensus but in line with the estimate. The company guided to a revenue decline of 0.5 percent quarter on quarter for Q4:16, with gross margin decline of 230 bps quarter on quarter to 61 percent. On The Sidelines Hari prefers to remain on the sidelines following the disappointing growth in the Data Center Group (DCG) and “lack of conviction on 2017 PC trends.” The analyst expressed concern regarding the continued weakness in the enterprise segment, mentioning that while DCG accelerated to 10 percent year-on-year growth in Q3, Intel lowered its full-year guidance to high-single-digit growth, from the earlier low-double-digit growth, citing enterprise headwinds. Related Link: Intel's Q4 Guidance Is Conservative “Growth in comms and cloud service provider remained strong, but we believe continued sluggishness in enterprise could weigh on broader DCG relative to Street expectations,” Hari stated. The analyst also expressed concern regarding uncertainty regarding PC end market demand, pointing to the company’s below seasonal guidance for Q4 and management commentary. “We continue to look for sustained evidence of better underlying PC demand before turning more positive,” Hari added.
