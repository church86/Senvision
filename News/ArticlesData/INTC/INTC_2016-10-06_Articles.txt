Freedman | October 5, 2016 02:22 pm MORE When Intel first showed off its new 7th Gen "Kaby Lake" CPUs, it made a bold claim: that an XPS 13 with the new chipset could play Overwatch with integrated graphics. On stage at the Intel Developers Forums, the company took a notebook with a Core-i5 CPU and played the game on stage. Later, at a meeting about the new CPUs, I asked Intel representatives what settings were used to play the game. When we got in the latest XPS 13 to review, I decided to recreate the experiment. In short: a computer with a Kaby Lake CPU can play Overwatch... to a point. I grabbed a review unit that came with an 2.5-Ghz Intel Core i5-7200U CPU, 8GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD, 1080p display and, of course, Intel HD Graphics 620. I installed Battle.net, downloaded Overwatch and got to fragging. On medium settings at 720p (the specs I was told were used at the show), the game was pretty stable at 30 frames per second, but occasionally would drop to 25 or 26 fps as I stomped across Eichenwald with D.Va's mech to riddle the enemy team with lasers. Even when I bumped the resolution to 1080p and protected my team's payload with Reinhardt's shields, the game ran relatively smoothly, maintaining the same 30 fps. The only problem was that in both cases, the game appeared blurry. The edges of Reaper's hellfire shotguns were jagged, and the characters posing on the games menu screen lacked detail in their armor and faces. MORE: Dell XPS 13 Review Most gamers (myself included) would rather play at a buttery 60 fps, so I decided to try removing the 30 fps cap in settings. At medium on 1080p, I laid traps across Ilios as Junkrat and found that the XPS 13 pushed up to 54 frames per second, which felt much smooth, but would also occasionally drop down to 26 frames per second. Despite the fuzzy visuals and occasional drops below 30 fps, I tried pushing up to high settings on 1080p, and the game struggled to hit 30 fps while I healed my teammates as Mercy during a skirmish. The game simply wasn't reliable enough to be playable at this point. So technically, yes, you can play Overwatch, and for integrated graphics, it's an impressive feat. If I was stuck waiting at an airport without a gaming machine, sure, I might play to stave off boredom. But it's far from the best experience that the game offers, and I'd much rather play on a console or legitimate gaming PC to enjoy the game as it was meant to be played: with smooth, detailed graphics and a consistent frame rate. The XPS 13 doesn't touch a gaming notebook. And while Overwatch is an intensive game, it's far from being one of the most graphically challenging on the market. There are still tons of games you won't be able to play at all. In most cases, I'd opt to play these on a real gaming machine, but hey, you can't argue with progress. ✖ Dell XPS 13 User Guide Dell XPS 13 User Guide How to Upgrade Your Dell XPS 13's SSD How to Increase Battery Life on the Dell XPS 13 How to Fix Dell XPS 13 Display Driver Problems How to Turn the Dell XPS 13's 'Nosecam' Into a Webcam Best Accessories for Your Dell XPS 13 Dell XPS 13 User Guide How to Upgrade Your Dell XPS 13's SSD How to Increase Battery Life on the Dell XPS 13 How to Fix Dell XPS 13 Display Driver Problems How to Turn the Dell XPS 13's 'Nosecam' Into a Webcam Best Accessories for Your Dell XPS 13 Next Tips »» «« Previous Tip Next Tip »» Dell XPS 13 User Guide Dell XPS 13 User Guide How to Upgrade Your Dell XPS 13's SSD How to Increase Battery Life on the Dell XPS 13 More Tips Dell XPS 13 User Guide How to Upgrade Your Dell XPS 13's SSD How to Increase Battery Life on the Dell XPS 13 How to Fix Dell XPS 13 Display Driver Problems How to Turn the Dell XPS 13's 'Nosecam' Into a Webcam Best Accessories for Your Dell XPS 13 Author Bio Andrew E.

If so basically the game was not playing at 1080p.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Gigabyte surrounds Kaby Lake CPUs with Brix by Zak Killian  2:07 PM on October 7, 2016 Now that the first Kaby Lake CPUs are out, everyone's got new versions of their toys to show off. Gigabyte is getting in on the fun by updating its popular Brix mini-PCs to the latest Intel processors. The company is debuting six new models based on three different Intel CPUs: the Core i3-7100U, Core i5-7200U, and Core i7-7500U. Each chip is getting a home in a corresponding pair of Brixes: one with room for a 2.5" storage device, and another, thinner version without. Besides the processor used and the presence (or lack) of the 2.5" bay, the new Brix machines are all identical. They come as barebones machines with two empty DDR4 SO-DIMM slots and an M.2 2280 slot. Right up front on the new Brixes are a pair of USB 3.1 ports: one Type-A and the other a Type-C. Those ports are powered by an Asmedia controller, so don't plug your Thunderbolt devices into these machines and expect them to work. A pair of USB 3.0 ports live on the back of the machine alongside an Intel-powered Gigabit Ethernet jack. Another Intel chip delivers both 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2. Gigabyte says the new Brixes can drive up to three displays, but doing so will require using displays that support DisplayPort chaining. Besides the mini-DP 1.2 connection, the little PCs can hook up to monitors and TVs using HDMI 2.0. The Kaby Lake chips in the new machines support hardware playback of 10-bit HEVC, so a display-mounted Brix (using the included VESA mount) could make for a neat little HTPC.

A Southwest Airlines jet was evacuated Oct. 5 in Louisville, Ky., after a Samsung Galaxy Note7 smartphone began smoking while the plane was still at a gate, potentially adding to Samsung's woes in connection with its recent Note7 global recall due to battery fires and explosions. The Louisville incident was revealed in an Oct. 5 report byNBC5 in Texas, which said the flight to Baltimore was evacuated when the fire was discovered. The airline's gate agents had already warned passengers about flying with Note7s that were turned on, the report said. The owner of the phone that began emitting smoke told the TV station that he was surprised when the incident unfolded in his pocket. In 2015, Yahoo allegedly developed a system that enables it to search all of its Yahoo Mail user accounts for information requested by the U.S. government, according to a Reuters report published on Oct. 4. Yahoo responded to media outlets requesting comment on the allegation with a terse one line comment: "Yahoo is a law-abiding company and complies with the laws of the United States." According to the report, Alex Stamos, Yahoo's former chief information security officer, left the job in June 2015 as a result of the company's compliance with the alleged U.S. government directive to enable email searches. Stamos had joined Yahoo in March 2014 and notably directly challenged National Security Agency Director Admiral Mike Rogers at a February 2015 event about security back doors for U.S. intelligence agencies in consumer software and services. Intel is turning to the cloud to make its consumer security capabilities more effective. The chip maker's security group this week unveiled enhancements to its McAfee AntiVirus Plus, Internet Security, Total Protection and LifeSafe software suite that aim to protect the growing number and variety of connected devices consumers are using as the internet of things ecosystem continues to grow. "People are enjoying more and more connected devices as part of everyday life—in their homes, in their cars and even in the things they wear," said John Giamatteo, corporate vice president and general manager at Intel Security. "This wave of new connectivity is exciting, and a reminder that security is more important than ever. We know our customers need solutions that protect their digital lives, particularly as connectivity continues to rise and threats continue to evolve," he added. Lenovo reportedly may buy Fujitsu's PC business, a move that would further expand Lenovo's lead position in the struggling global PC market while enabling Fujitsu to get the money-losing unit off its books.  Fujitsu officials, in a statement to The Wall Street Journal, said they "are considering various options for the PC unit, including a possible deal with Lenovo." Lenovo has declined to comment on the reports, which included the Nikkei business daily in Japan citing an unnamed source saying officials with the two companies are in talks with the hope of reaching a deal this month. The deal would move about 2,000 Fujitsu employees over to Lenovo, the Nikkei reported.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

To calculate the market size, the report considers the revenue generated from the sales of NAND flash chips to consumer electronics manufacturers for smartphones, tablets, audio players, and digital still cameras (DSCs) segments. The global mobile negative-AND (NAND) flash market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.2% during the forecast period. NAND flash is gaining more popularity over dynamic random access memory (DRAM) as it does not have to be powered continuously to retain data. Vendors are shifting their focus from the production of 2D NAND to 3D NAND, as the latter stores more bits of data per layer of memory cells and lowers the cost per gigabyte. The smartphone and tablet application segments are the two largest segments of the global mobile NAND flash market. NAND flash is ideal for portable devices due to its non-volatile feature and hence it is widely used in smartphones and tablets. The smartphone market is growing at a CAGR of 7.61% and the tablet market is growing at a CAGR of 8.32%, which provides an incentive for NAND flash vendors. Competitive vendor landscape The market is dominated by major vendors and the competition among vendors in the market is intense. As the entry barriers in the market are high, the entry of new players in the market is difficult. Many new suppliers are attracted to the market because of its high growth potential. The existing vendors in the market are investing heavily in R&D of new and innovative products. "Samsung produces 3D NAND flash by vertically stacking the memory cells instead of photolithography, which enables 3D NAND to provide more capacity and occupy less space. Micron Technology and Intel have jointly manufactured the high-density 3D NAND flash memory known as 3D XPoint," says Chetan Mohan, a lead embedded systems analyst from Technavio. Samsung is mass-producing 3D-NAND flash memory, and it has gradually increased its market share. Toshiba and SanDisk are also expected to increase supplies of NAND flash products during the forecast period. Intel is expected to start manufacturing 3D NAND flash products in Dalian, China, in the second half of 2016. Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=53302 Technavio's sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. Top six mobile NAND flash market vendors Intel The NAND flash business of Intel comes under the non-volatile memory solutions segment. The company's NAND flash memory products are manufactured by IM Flash Technologies and Micron Technology. In 2015, the company announced the launch of 3D XPoint technology, which is a type of non-volatile memory. The introduction of products like 3D NAND and 3D XPoint technology is helping companies to deliver solutions to customers in their data centers and Internet of Things businesses. The company has also increased its capital investment in new memory technologies. Micron Technology It manufactures and sells a full range of memory products such as DRAM, NAND flash, and not OR (NOR) flash memory for applications in computing, networking, consumer, industrial, automotive, embedded, and mobile products sectors. In the NAND flash memory segment, the company offers high-speed SLC, MLC, and TLC NAND flash products. These products are compatible with advanced interfaces. MLC products have two times the bit density of SLC products and TLC products have three times the bit density of SLC products. Samsung Electronics Samsung plans to strengthen its core business by focussing on segments such as memory chips, TVs, and mobile phones to develop premium products and strengthen technology leadership. In 2015, Samsung Electronics was the market leader of NAND flash memory, accounting for 32.57% of the total market. Its top ranking in the NAND memory market is supported by its superior technology. SanDisk SanDisk products include flash storage solutions for enterprise data centers and client computing platforms, and removable and embedded flash products for mobile devices, automotive, cameras, and connected home electronics. The products are reliable and affordable and are used as flash storage solutions by consumers and enterprises in a variety of devices and applications. SK Hynix SK Hynix produces memory semiconductors like DRAM and NAND flash, which are required for mobile devices, computers, and other IT devices. The demand for larger volumes of compact, high-capacity, and high-speed products such as TLC and 3D NAND flash has been increasing. Therefore, the company has been focusing on producing 16-nano MLC since 2014. The company has employed the cost reduction process through TLC and the 3D technology to increase its market share in the NAND flash market. Toshiba Toshiba has a strategic alliance with SanDisk for the production of NAND flash memory, which includes production joint ventures. Under this agreement, Toshiba is allowed to purchase SanDisk's ownership interests in the production joint ventures. Furthermore, Toshiba and SanDisk each provide a 50% guaranty in respect of the lease agreements of production facilities held by the production joint ventures. The aim of the joint venture is to strengthen the production of NAND flash memory.

While computer technology is constantly improving and evolving, rarely do we experience moments where we simply... Read More ). That’s not acceptable on a Windows 10 machine. Other systems do fine with 2 GB, mainly Linux and Android — or even the astounding Remix OS A Real, Android-Based Alternative to Windows: Remix OS 2.0 A Real, Android-Based Alternative to Windows: Remix OS 2.0 Read More . For multi-tabbed browsing and other tasks expected of Windows users, 2 GB of RAM causes frequent stuttering during multitasking, disk wear, and other performance problems. On top of that, Windows takes up a whopping 20 GB of space on a hard drive — that leaves less than 12 GB of space free on a 32 GB drive. Unlike SATA and NVMe SSDs, eMMC modules just aren’t built for performance. While they’re mostly faster than regular Hard Disc Drives, they can perform worse (or about the same) in sequential writes with deep queue depths. Here’s how the eMMC module inside of the Byte Plus benchmarked on CrystalDiskMark (tools for benchmarking CrystalDiskMark & CrystalDiskInfo - Valuable Disk Diagnostics For Free [Windows] CrystalDiskMark & CrystalDiskInfo - Valuable Disk Diagnostics For Free [Windows] There was once a time when I was a naive kid on a desktop who never even considered that I'd have to keep up with the health of my hard drive. Jumping from the world... Read More ). The Competition Within the mini-PC market, there’s a disturbing lack of diversity in processors, RAM, and storage capacity. That’s because Intel insists that the Atom platform use no more than 4 GB of RAM. The majority of devices in this price segment could, in theory, perform at a much higher level with faster storage options and larger amounts of RAM. Unfortunately, that would cannibalize sales of Intel’s mainstream Core series processors. At present, the sort of devices available on the mini-PC market tend to look almost identical to one another — except the cooling system. In general, if you’re buying a fanless mini-PC, the cooling system is the most critical component. An efficient heatsink allows a Cherry Trail processor to maintain its performance for longer periods of time. On top of increased snappiness, a better cooling system can improve system durability. So within the $200 market, how many other mini-PCs compete with the Azulle Byte Plus? The best known is the ASRock Beebox, which offers a unit with similar specifications, and barebones options, at a higher price. A smaller competitor is the Kangaroo Moble Desktop Pro, which costs about the same as the Byte Plus and offers almost identical specs. Of the two, neither really rivals the cooling system of the Byte. However, the Beebox is user-serviceable. Performance A sane person wouldn’t use a mini-PC for complex rendering or video-editing projects. For the most part, users of the Byte Plus might find themselves web-browsing, visiting social media sites, streaming media, or even running wireless presentations. In all these roles, the Byte Plus functions in the same fashion as a $1,000 desktop computer. Provided the user stays within its performance confines, the Byte Plus makes a tantalizing value proposition on the grounds of its portability, reliable performance, and low cost. Computing Tasks: Social Media, Chat, Office, and Browsing The mini-PC’s performance — in real terms — for general computing feels fluid and snappy. Users can run virtually all Windows 10 applications without much stutter or lag, such as Skype or Microsoft Office. For web surfing, it won’t open a hundred tabs without being bogged down under the weight of advertisements and poorly crafted Javascript — but it will browse a few web pages at a time, without much issue. Even so, I would recommend that prospective buyers look very carefully at the 4 GB Byte Plus version rather than the 2 GB starter model. Media PC: Streaming Media, Gaming, and Playback The mini-PC excels as an HTPC or light gaming rig. Most mobile games, such as Minecraft and Asphalt 8, run great. It also streams 1080p media with ease and it plays 4K content without issue. As far as gaming goes, the Byte Plus handles all mobile games you could throw at it. Asphalt 8 on Extreme settings runs fluidly and with a maximum temperature of 73 degrees Celsius after several hours of continuous use. Minecraft runs just as smoothly — even so, don’t expect to play the latest non-mobile games on an Atom processor. Not that you would want to install the Steam client, with only around 12 GB of free storage capacity. On the downside, the Byte Plus doesn’t stream 4K media, although it streams 1080p. Part of the reason it may suffer problems streaming 4K stems from its single-stream Wi-Fi card, the Intel 3160. The 3160 hits about half the speed of a wireless-AC 2×2 card and is about as fast as a dual-band 802.11n card. That’s fast, but not blazing fast for internal network speeds or streaming 4K video. I couldn’t test the Byte Plus’s performance in 4K playback. However, the Cherry Trail processor inside of the Byte possesses more than enough horsepower. Power Consumption The Byte Plus, like most Cherry Trail-based systems-on-a-chip (what’s an SoC? Jargon Buster: The Guide to Understanding Mobile Processors Jargon Buster: The Guide to Understanding Mobile Processors In this guide, we'll cut through the jargon to explain what you need to know about smartphone processors. Read More ), offers extraordinary power efficiency. Not only does it sip energy, but it also drains a remarkable zero watts while turned off. Its power consumption compares favorably with even the European standard for energy consumption, which sets the bar at a half watt of power consumed while turned off. I believe that this has to do with some of Cherry Trail’s newly introduced power saving features, rather than any unique hardware customizations by Azulle. Here’re a few energy consumption readings that I took with a wattage meter How Much Power Is Your PC Using? How Much Power Is Your PC Using? Computer power consumption can be estimated. Most of the components inside a PC have specific minimum and maximum power draw figures and, because quality control is so tight, it’s rare of a part to break... Read More : Power consumption at load: 13–15 watts Power consumption while idle: 7–8 watts Power consumption while powered off: 0 watts What’s Missing in the Byte Plus? A strange omission concerning the Byte Plus is the lack of a USB Type-C port (what’s USB Type-C? What Is USB Type-C? What Is USB Type-C? Ah, the USB plug. It is as ubiquitous now as it is notorious for never being able to be plugged in right the first time. Read More ). At present, few desktop computers include the technology. Even so, USB-C would have given the Byte Plus an added degree of future-proofing. I’m not sure why Azulle chose to leave it out. Another feature lacking in the Byte Plus is user-serviceability. There doesn’t appear to be any means of dismantling the device or replacing parts. Compounding issues, users can access the BIOS (what’s a BIOS? Why Does My Motherboard Have A Battery? Why Does My Motherboard Have A Battery? Whether you’re using a desktop computer or a laptop, your computer’s motherboard contains an integrated battery. Unlike a standard laptop battery, the motherboard’s battery doesn’t power your computer while you're using it. Quite the opposite,... Read More ), which means the system can be rendered unbootable through accidental misconfiguration. If that happens, there’s no method of resetting the BIOS, which translates into a hard brick (that means a broken device). However, these problems aren’t deal-breaking in the slightest. Overall, the Azulle Byte Plus offers few vices and a lot of virtues. Should You Buy the Azulle Byte Plus? At around $200 the Azulle Byte Plus compares on equal footing to many of its small form factor competitors. In its niche, the Byte excels within several roles for two reasons. First, it can deliver unthrottled performance for a longer period than any stick PC with similar specifications. Second, it includes more ports, ethernet capabilities, and versatility than its competitors, which make it useful in a range of roles. For most users, it’s one of the best Cherry Trail mini-PCs around. Byte Plus (Fanless Windows 10 Mini Desktop PC - Intel CherryTrail T3 Z8300 Quad-Core, 1.44 GHz (up to 1.84 GHz) 4GB RAM+32GB storage) Byte Plus (Fanless Windows 10 Mini Desktop PC - Intel CherryTrail T3 Z8300 Quad-Core, 1.44 GHz (up to 1.84 GHz) 4GB RAM+32GB storage) Azulle's byte plus can be purchased either with a Windows 10 or Linux operating system. It's compact size, allows you to neatly tuck away the byte plus and keep your desk area neat. Buy Now At Amazon $189.99 If you need Windows 10 and a small, efficient PC, then Azulle’s device should satisfy your needs. On the other hand, it packs in similar specifications as a Chromebook, at the same price — and a Chromebook can fulfill most of the things that the Byte Plus can. Our verdict of the Azulle Byte Plus: Buy it if you need a mini-PC with Windows 10. Otherwise, you might be better off with a Chromebook.810 Previous PostiLife X5 Robot Vacuum Review and GiveawayNext PostPokémon GO Plus Review 6 comments Write a Comment Paul Rhodes October 17, 2016 at 1:35 am The small computer is Ideal for people who do not have a lot of room , helping to keep in touch with the world.

Page 1 of 4. 78 Comments Today the RADV Radeon Vulkan driver is landing in mainline Mesa and just hit the Git code minutes ago. Merging the RADV driver came up just over the past few weeks in time for next month's Mesa stable release while this community-based driver was developed over the summer by David Airlie and Bas Nieuwenhuizen. This "unofficial" Radeon Vulkan open-source driver is now becoming part of the Mesa code-base with it being able to support the few Vulkan Linux games but isn't yet a fully conformant driver. Here are fresh benchmarks of the RADV driver compared to the RadeonSI OpenGL driver and benchmarks compared to AMD's hybrid closed-source AMDGPU-PRO driver on several different graphics cards. RADV As The (Unofficial) Radeon Vulkan Driver For Linux RADV in action! As confirmed via vulkaninfo output. Fresh from Git as of this morning. Since last year AMD communicated that they would be initially releasing a closed-source Vulkan Linux driver that would later be open-sourced. We are about eight months past the Vulkan 1.0 release, but this Vulkan Linux driver has yet to be open-sourced. In the absence of the open-source Radeon Vulkan driver, David Airlie and Bas Nieuwenhuizen set out to develop their own "community" based Radeon Vulkan driver at least as an interim solution and potentially to pressure AMD to get out their official Vulkan driver. Bas Nieuwenhuizen is an independent contributor while David Airlie is the DRM subsystem maintainer and Red Hat developer who has long been involved in open-source AMD/ATI Linux driver efforts. This new driver, RADV, is housed within a Mesa Git branch but is being merged to mainline Mesa today. RADV re-uses the AMDGPU LLVM compiler back-end, makes use of Intel's work on NIR within Mesa, and interfaces with the AMDGPU kernel DRM driver. Airlie explained in his original RADV announcement that this Radeon Vulkan driver is based upon Intel's "ANV" open-source Vulkan driver while the winsys to interface with the AMDGPU DRM kernel code is ported from Gallium3D. The RADV approach basically goes from SPIR-V through the NIR intermediate representation to LLVM IR for consumption by the AMDGPU LLVM back-end. There isn't any "Vulkan state tracker" for Gallium3D with this Khronos API being too low-level for implementing on top of Gallium. Back in August the RADV driver began rendering Dota 2 correctly, a few weeks later then began running The Talos Principle and vkQuake without issues. Now it's hitting mainline Mesa and in turn will be reaching more Linux distributions. The bring-up of RADV was very brisk due to being able to re-use a lot of existing open-source Linux driver code and the fact that Vulkan drivers are much lighter/thinner than OpenGL drivers. Due to the success of RADV, there has been communication from John Bridgman and others that their focus may shift from working to open-source their proprietary driver to instead focus on helping with code contributions to areas of RADV where it needs to be improved... We heard this weeks ago but still haven't seen any major contributions by AMD to the RADV driver stack. We'll see in the weeks/months ahead regarding what AMD open-sources for Vulkan, but it seems RADV is taking hold and the open-source AMD developers haven't objected to seeing this driver merged into mainline Mesa. Current Driver State While this RADV driver can run the currently available Vulkan Linux games (Dota 2, vkQuake and Talos Principle), it's not fully conformant with Vulkan 1.0 as some features are still missing. Additionally, there is much room still for more performance optimizations. Just keep that in mind before getting your hopes too high... Dota 2 continues running well with RADV. The Radeon Vulkan driver isn't built by default with Mesa builds but requires setting the --with-vulkan-drivers=radeon argument. Additionally, Mesa must be built against LLVM 3.9 or newer. Also keep in mind your GPU needs to be supported by the AMDGPU kernel driver, see the next section about hardware support. Intel and Radeon (RADV) are the two current Vulkan drivers in Mesa. Current Hardware Support The RADV driver was developed around Volcanic Islands (Fury, Tonga, etc) and Polaris (RX 400 series) hardware. This is in conjunction with the AMDGPU kernel driver. However, if making use of the experimental CIK and SI support in AMDGPU, it should be possible to get older GCN GPUs working with this Vulkan driver. The GCN 1.1 CIK support has been around as an experimental build-time option on recent Linux kernel releases while the GCN 1.0 Southern Islands experimental support is only landing with Linux 4.9. This requires spinning your own kernel or finding a third-party kernel build that's enabling this functionality for AMDGPU. The RADV driver will not work with the Radeon DRM driver nor will it be ported to any pre-GCN (HD 7000 series) hardware. The Talos Principle renders correctly with RADV the past few weeks. Fresh Benchmarks For seeing the state of the RADV driver, I tested out the latest code (David Airlie's radv-submit2 branch) as of this morning as the code being merged this evening to mainline Mesa. This was tested with the Linux 4.8 stable kernel. The focus for testing was on various Volcanic Islands and Polaris graphics cards. In a follow-up article will be tests with CIK/SI GPUs.

The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Maryland revealed on Oct. 5 that a National Security Agency contractor was arrested on Aug. 27 on charges of stealing classified documents. Charged is 51-year-old Harold Thomas Martin III on allegations that he removed and retained classified government documents. Law enforcement executed a search warrant on Martin's property on Aug. 27 and found documents that the government labeled top-secret. According to the Justice Department, six classified document were recovered that were originally produced by U.S. intelligence officials in 2014. On Sept. 29, Microsoft released a cumulative update for Windows 10 Anniversary Edition that promised to fix a long list of issues and improve the performance of several of the operating system's components. After the update started reaching the general public, users started hitting the Windows 10 Early Access and Support forums with a barrage of complaints that their Windows 10 machines were stuck in a perpetual update loop. As a workaround, Microsoft suggested that users visit the Windows 10 upgrade page, download the media creation tool and select the "Upgrade This PC Now" option while choosing to "keep everything." This workaround allows users to update their PCs while keeping their data files, settings and applications intact. Another, more involved option involved tinkering with the registry. Intel officials view the wearable space as a significant growth area for the company as it aggressively moves away from its legacy as primarily a PC chip maker to become a major technology supplier for an increasingly connected world. Intel has been showing off its latest innovations for connected wearables over the past several weeks. Most recently, Intel and Luxottica Group this week unveiled the Oakley-branded Radar Pace smart eyewear, which essentially acts as a virtual coach for wearers while running or cycling. The smart glasses, which sell for $449 on the Oakley website, connect to free smartphone apps for Apple's iOS or Google's Android mobile operating systems and use Intel's Real Speech technology to communicate with the wearer. Microsoft is apparently taking its 2-year-old Band fitness wristband product line off the market. The 2-year-old Band 2 was recently removed from the online Microsoft Store and has not been slated for a new model replacement. The Band 2, which previously was listed in the online store with a variety of other brands, including Fitbit, is no longer listed on the web page. Microsoft confirmed the move in an Oct. 5 reply to an eWEEK inquiry. "We have sold through our existing Band 2 inventory and have no plans to release another Band device this year," a spokesman told eWEEK. "We remain committed to supporting our Microsoft Band 2 customers through Microsoft Stores and our customer support channels and will continue to invest in the Microsoft Health platform, which is open to all hardware and apps partners across Windows, iOS, and Android devices."       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

News & Analysis Intel's Stratix 10 FPGAs, SoCs Sampling Max Maxfield 10/6/2016 03:50 PM EDT 3 comments NO RATINGS 1 saves Login to Rate Tweet Last year, the folks at CPU giant Intel (which acquired FPGA vendor Altera) gave us a sneak peek at the capabilities, capacity, performance, and features of their forthcoming Stratix 10 FPGAs and SoCs (see Altera's Stratix 10 FPGAs & SoCs -- Breakthroughs in Performance, Integration, Density, and Security). Earlier this year, they threw the veils open a little wider to provide more concrete details regarding the Stratix 10 MX family of System-in-Package (SiP) devices (see Stratix 10 MX: 1 TBps On-Chip Memory Bandwidth in Single FPGA). Stratix 10 FPGAs and SoCs are fabricated using Intel's 14nm Tri-Gate process. Intel just announced that it has started sampling these devices to its customers (see Intels Stratix 10 FPGA: Supporting the Smart and Connected Revolution). (Source: Intel) Stratix 10 innovations and capabilities include: 2X the core performance and over 5X the density compared to the previous generation. Up to 70 percent lower power than Stratix V FPGAs for equivalent performance. Up to 10 TFLOPS of single-precision floating point DSP performance. Up to 1 TBps memory bandwidth with integrated High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM2) in-package. An embedded quad-core 64-bit ARM Cortex-A53 processor. Devices like Stratix 10 FPGAs will help service providers, data centers, cloud computing, and storage systems to satisfy their insatiable demand for higher computational capabilities, lower latency, greater system flexibility, and increased power efficiencies (Click Here for more information).

Does anyone have a clue what this does to place and route time? For a couple of years I have been saying that design should be done at the logic/function level to minimize P&R run time.  With 5X density P&R must increase 5X to 25X? so that aggravates what is already an issue for potential users. We used to do logic design and manual "simulation/analysis" then use wiring tools for physical design and it worked very well.  It turned out that 85% or more of the nets had no timing issues.  There were no simulation/timing analysis tools. Use of IP needs tools that can take the physical as well as the functional block intact and "plug it in".  Doing P&R of the IP may cause serious problems. ASIC design adopted master slice because full custom took too long and some speed and density was probably sacrificed. FPGA design may have to make som trade-offs. FPGAs have block ram, dsp, multiply, etc already placed.(and if they are not all used, so what?)  Now why not have 16/32 bit registers at least preconfigured if not pre-placed?  If you need 8 or 24 bit regs, just use a 16 or 42 and not wire 8 bits?  Remember density increased 5X. Some CPUs still use microcode which is just a nice big LUT--that is easily changed--for control. By the way, the 2X performance increase was circuit speed--metal wiring delay may have increased because of RC effect. Remember, Steve Leibson(Xilinx) wrote "time is all in the wiring" for the current generation. Anyone interested in asynchronous logic?  Maybe there is enough wiring delay to overlap circuit resolution with transfer time.

Altera was focused mainly on the middle range of its line in past two years delaying this chip a lot. Still most of the work is done now. I believe the shift to 10nm will be pretty fast as the process will yield enough to allow good economics. My compliments to Altera guys.

(Photo: Intel) At 72, Kathie Neffenger is proud to admit she’s not a techno-phobe by any stretch. In her past career, she helped set up IT systems for manufacturers, so the retiree is no stranger to computers. But she also knows, with the speed of technology evolution, there’s always more to learn. “We (technology literate seniors) all realize that once you get out there (on the Internet) alone, you need to have some savvy,” she said. Last summer, Neffenger took an Intel-sponsored cyber safety course at the Sun Lakes facility of New Adventures In Learning, a nonprofit affiliated with the Chandler-Gilbert Community College that provides educational resources for area seniors. The cyber safety course is one way Intel supports area seniors through its New Adventures partnership. Intel Involved According to 2014 research conducted by the Pew Research Center, six in 10 older adults, defined as those over the age of 65, go online. What some view as a generation that was left behind by technology, needing to learn it from their grandchildren and children, is evolving into its own melting pot of early and late adopters, Neffenger explained. Always curious to learn more when it comes to technology, the retiree took home a few good tips from the cyber safety program. One tid-bit she still talks about involves not clicking the “X” on pop-ups in certain situations. With that move you can prevent an outsider from accessing your personal information on your computer. “Use the ‘back arrow,’” she remembered from the class. “They were preaching to the choir, but we still wanted to learn new songs. … We think we know it all, but we really don’t.” A good portion of the cyber safety course centers on identity theft. Some estimates say senior-targeted identity theft scams steal $3 billion annually from retirement accounts. New Adventures Curriculum Chair, Jan Bobbett, said she learned which emails to avoid and how looking for certain clues before opening them could help her figure out if the mail was from a legitimate sender or not. “We are reminded that others can take control of our computers and those actors are pretty clever. It’s not new but identity theft is a good basis of focus for the class,” she added. Back to Basics Intel has also offered classes introducing seniors to iPhone and Android devices, Bobbett said, and the Intel partnership keeps expanding. This fall, the tech giant’s volunteers will teach a six-session computer basics class covering uses relevant to daily living like popular apps, email basics, word processing, social media, spreadsheets, Skype and other multi-media platforms. “With all the classes we teach here, we still get so many requests for basic computer classes,” Bobbett added. The Intel partnership also brings operating funds to New Adventures. With each hour volunteered by an Intel employee, the Intel Involved Matching Grant Program (IIMGP) generates $10 in funds for the nonprofit. “I was sort of amazed they contributed to us financially, too,” Bobbett said. In the past, Intel offered two classes focusing on the company’s history which also gave insights on its manufacturing processes and technology developed right in the valley, Bobbett recalled. In addition, some area seniors have enjoyed Intel site tours at its Chandler facility. This past summer, Intel allowed two June tours for seniors. In each tour, a group of 10 saw the “Maker Space,” an innovative room at the facility where engineers explore new ideas in a casual setting. At the time, a 3D printer was churning out a prosthetic hand that would be donated to a local child in need, remembered Mary Kenny, New Adventures’ president. “That, to me, was fascinating,” she said. “I know they bring in a lot of young kids to get them excited about science, but this group of retirees had so many questions. People were fascinated by what they were seeing.” To learn more about Intel’s commitment to digital safety, click here. 1085 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://azc.cc/2dpRntO Intel Intel's pro bono legal clinic helps Arizonans battling financial hardships Nov 14, 2016 More Stories from Intel Camp gives Chandler junior high girls a fresh look at STEM opportunities Sponsor story Intel offers Jedi mentors, funding to invite youth into STEM dialogue Sponsor story Intel-sponsored program shows Latinas STEM career possibilities Sponsor story Foundation connects at-risk youth to STEM possibilities Sponsor story

The device had a smartphone-like form factor, enabling owners to shove a fully enabled PC into their pocket. The unit had a surface mimicking steel and a “Racing” logo illuminated with customizable backlit RGB LEDs. The company said it would arrive in the third quarter of 2016, and now it’s listed as available on the company’s Racing P1 product page. Here’s a brief list of the specs:   Racing P1 Processor Intel Atom x5-Z8350 Cores/Threads 4/4 Base clock speed 1.44GHz Boost clock speed 1.92GHz Graphics Intel HD Graphics 400 System memory 4GB DDR3L @ 1,600MHz Storage 64GB eMMC Flash Audio Realtek ALC5645 2-channel On the front panel, the new Racing P1 mini-PC provides one USB 3.0 port, one USB 2.0 port, one Micro SD card reader, a line-out/microphone input jack, and the power button. On the back, the unit provides four USB 2.0 ports, one gigabit Ethernet port, and one HDMI port for connecting the unit to a monitor or HDTV. That means professionals could stuff the unit in their briefcase and connect the device to a hotel room’s TV instead of carrying a laptop. Related: Biostar takes aim at PC gaming market with its very first mouse, the $10 AM2 The mini-PC is sold with an included disc packing the company’s Racing GT, BullGuard, and BIO-Remote 2 utilities. Given that the Racing P1 doesn’t come with an operating system installed, customers will have to pay an additional $120 for Windows 10 Home or $200 for Windows 10 Pro. The device supports either 64-bit versions of Microsoft’s new operating system. The Intel processor packed inside isn’t all that old, and was released in the first quarter of 2016. Surprisingly, Intel says that the maximum memory capacity this chip supports is 2GB yet the device provides 4GB. Windows 10 demands 2GB for the 64-bit version, which would indicate why Biostar crammed 4GB into the unit. The processor and memory are integrated (soldered) into Biostar’s motherboard, so maybe Biostar figured out a way to work around the processor’s 2GB limit. Although the unit provides gigabit connectivity for wired networking, the Racing P1 also provides Wireless AC to connect to wireless networks. It offers Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity as well for pairing Bluetooth-based devices like a smartphone, tablet, headset, mouse, and/or keyboard. The overall dimensions are 129.4(L) x 83(W) x 27(H) mm, and it weighs just nine ounces. The new Racing P1 mini-PC is part of the company’s new “Racing” family of products that includes the Z170 GT7 motherboard and an SSD served up in three capacity options: 120GB, 240GB, and 480GB. The company said in August that it spent three times the marketing budget for 2016 than it has in the past few years to promote this new family of products. The Racing P1 mini-PC is available to purchase now for $160 although it hadn’t shown up on Newegg or Amazon at the time of writing.

News & Analysis Startup Digs Deep Learning, Snags Big Backers Junko Yoshida 10/6/2016 10:36 AM EDT 3 comments NO RATINGS 2 saves Login to Rate Tweet PARIS — At a time when “Deep Learning” isn’t just hot but approaching the hype-cycle’s boiling point, nobody should be surprised at the emergence of another deep-learning, vision processing startup. Dinakar Munagala This one is called ThinCI (pronounced “Think-Eye”), founded by Dinakar Munagala, an accomplished engineer/architect with an Intel pedigree. Surprising about ThinCI (El Dorado Hills, Calif.), however, is its well-heeled, big-name backers with credible technological expertise, and a unique “massively parallel architecture” which Munagala describes as an engine “purposely built for vision processing and deep learning.” Munagala promises that his patent-pending chip architecture can bring “two orders of magnitude improvements in performance” compared to other deep learning/vision processing solutions. ThinCI, after operating in a garage on a shoe-string budget for six years, is emerging from stealth mode this week. It recently snagged two big automotive tier ones as institutional investors and secured a roster of who’s who in the tech industry as private investors. The two tier ones signed up are DENSO International America, Inc., and Magna International Inc. Private investors include: Dado Banatao, chairman ThinCI board of directors and managing partner, Tallwood Venture Capital; Dadi Perlmutter, former executive vice president, general manager of Intel Corp.’s Architecture Group; Jürgen Hambrecht, chairman of the Supervisory Board of BASF SE and Member of Supervisory Board of Daimler AG; and several others of similar stature. Simplicity, flexibility Dadi Perlmutter Perlmutter, asked why invest in ThinCI, told EE Times, “Through all my career I significantly appreciated simplicity and flexibility. I always preferred approaches that went away from brute force, and looked at the bottlenecks of a new computing problem, and found ways to eliminate the bottlenecks by finding new approaches. ThinCI has done just that.” While other solutions are limited to moving data in and out to feed a big, hungry computing engine, Perlmutter described ThinCI computing as “tailored to Deep Learning graph analysis.” He said it “eliminates by a huge factor unnecessary access to memory.” Its end results? “This results not only in speeding up the computation but reducing cost and power,” he added. Munagala told EE Times that he quit Intel six years ago with ambitions to develop a new chip architecture that can meet the needs of next-generation technologies, such as deep learning. ThinCI, however, has yet to disclose details of its processor architecture. The company describes it “a revolutionary graph streaming processor.” Munagala explained to EE Times that this is “a massively parallel architecture designed to process multiple compute nodes of a task graph at the same time.” Deep learning, in essence, is based on a set of algorithms that try to model high level abstractions in data by using a deep graph with many processing layers, composed of multiple linear and non-linear transformations. What’s unique about ThinCI’s architecture appears to be in the way it handles a deep graph. Instead of processing data sequentially through a deep graph, with multiple processing layers, “ThinCI’s architecture streams data through the entire graph using extreme parallelism,” explained Munagala. But that’s only half of the story.

We'd love to learn more about the technology and the actual chip. As for business model, I believe ThinCI is a fabless chip company. What's interesting is that there is a growing demand out on the market -- automotive or embedded -- looking for alternative solutions to Mobileye and Intel (Movidius) for vision processing. ThinCI appears to promise what some wanted to hear. The startup said that it is planning to disclose more details on this at a later date -- separately from  this announcement.

The company is making bold claims, but we'd sure like to see something that backs it up. What's the business model? Is it an IP licensed to mobile SoC makers or do they expect people to buy their chips? It appears to be a learning Neural Net machine that still needs lots of data fed to it to learn the answer. That's actually part of the value a company like MobileEye brings - its data set. Still, it's good to see funding for hardware/IP.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 6, 2016 at 9:21AM Image source: Intel.  Microprocessor giant Intel's(NASDAQ:INTC) organic efforts to build applications processors targeted at the smartphone market saw little success over the last five years or so. The company could never quite build chips that offered compelling enough performance, power consumption, and features to convince major smartphone manufacturers to adopt its solutions over, say, those of major players such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), MediaTek, and others. Although Intel is currently not an active participant in the smartphone applications processor market, the company has made it clear that it intends to continue to participate in it as a contract manufacturer for other chip designers. One such deal that's been publicly known about for quite some time is the tie-up between Intel and mobile processor maker Spreadtrum. Though neither company has said much about the products that they will be building together, Digitimes has a very interesting scoop vis-a-vis this partnership. Products sampling soon, aiming for Samsung smartphones Digitimes says that Spreadtrum will begin "sample shipments" of its chips built in Intel's 14-nanometer manufacturing technology "starting in October." Spreadtrum is apparently "looking to grab orders for Samsung's mid-range smartphone series for 2017," according to Digitimes' "industry sources." Although winning spots inside of Samsung's mid-range phones is certainly not as glamorous as winning spots in the company's Galaxy S and Galaxy Note flagships, a significant portion of the smartphones that Samsung sells are low-end and mid-range handsets. Samsung tends to use many different suppliers for these mid-range and low-end phones (e.g. Samsung's own chips, Qualcomm, Spreadtrum, and reportedly soon MediaTek), so pricing is probably competitive and margins are likely relatively slim. Nevertheless, that's probably more Spreadtrum's problem than Intel's. Contract chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) achieves an average gross profit margin of around 50% these days building mobile chips for third parties, who then go on to sell those TSMC-produced chips at 30%+ gross profit margins. As long as Intel's cost structure is under control, it should be able to profit nicely from its partnership with Spreadtrum, even in an aggressive pricing environment for smartphone processors. Why this partnership is important Spreadtrum is a major smartphone applications processor supplier, so if Spreadtrum achieves success with Intel's 14-nanometer technology -- a good first indicator would be if Samsung ultimately chooses to use these Intel-built Spreadtrum chips in mid-range smartphones -- it could conceivably use Intel's 10-nanometer process in the future, as well as 14-nanometer for future, likely lower-end, parts. More importantly, though, I suspect that many potential Intel foundry customers are waiting to see how things go with Intel and Spreadtrum. Intel's pitch has been that it has the world's best manufacturing technology in terms of performance, power, and area. If Spreadtrum's products bear out those claims, then that could compel other smartphone applications processor makers to sign on with Intel rather than use TSMC or another contract chip manufacturer. However, if Spreadtrum's products don't enjoy a significant competitive advantage as a result of being built on Intel's tech, then Intel's near-to-medium term opportunities as a contract chip manufacturer for mobile processors may be limited until something fundamentally changes (e.g. Intel's technology becomes more competitive, it becomes more aggressive on pricing, or something else).

For the organization's 11th panel discussion tackling the biggest issues facing women in the workplace today, leading female executives from Intel, Korn Ferry Futurestep, TalkTalk and Orange will be discussing the "middle in the muddle." According to McKinsey & Company, women in the workplace often find themselves grappling with three different scenarios: being unable to enter, stuck in the middle or locked out of the top. WiC's event, its third to take place in London, will focus on why women may get mired in the middle and how to fix the "leaky pipeline" problem for talented women in comms. Speakers will include Lorna Keane, Engineering Manager, Network Platforms Group, Intel; Erin Callaghan, Managing Consultant, EMEA Advanced Technology, Korn Ferry Futurestep; Alexandra Tempest, Director of Partners, TalkTalk Business; Jehanne Savi, Executive Leader of the All-IP & On-Demand Networks Programs, Orange Corp; and panel moderator Elizabeth Miller Coyne, Light Reading's Managing Editor. "While it's not uncommon to see females in middle management positions, they often either meet challenges progressing any further or leave the workplace at this time," said WiC Director Sarah Thomas. "This a phenomenon we want to better understand and begin to rectify. Our panelists -- all of whom have crossed the middle management hurtle and are working to help others do so too -- will shed light on how we can fix the comm industry's leaky pipeline. We're looking forward to an enlightening discussion, as always." This free event will provide both an informal setting for women and men in the industry to meet and network and a forum to exchange ideas, learn and grow. Women in Comms and its members are hosting this networking event on October 18 as part of KNect's Women in TMT meet-up at Broadband World Forum in London, sponsored by Accenture. All attendees are invited to stay for lunch and more great discussions following the WiC event. For more information and to register to attend the full event, please visit https://tmt.knect365.com/bbwf/women-in-tmt. Since January of this year, WiC has grown its membership to nearly 40 companies, including the industry's leading service providers, vendors and industry associations. WiC's current member roster includes founding partner Intel Corporation; presenting partners Dell, Flex, Nokia and Sprint; silver partners Ciena, Cisco, CommScope, Fujitsu Network Communications, Hitachi Consulting, Infinera, Netcracker, NetNumber, Parallel Wireless, Redknee and SAP; service provider partners AT&T, Boingo Wireless, CenturyLink, Charter Communications, Hyperoptic Ltd., Level 3 Communications, Rogers Communications, TalkTalk PLC, Verizon Communications, Vodafone Americas, Windstream and XO Communications; and partner organizations Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS), DFW - Alliance of Technology & Women, IEEE Women in Engineering, Open Networking Lab, Open Networking Foundation, OPNFV, NTCA - The Rural Broadband Association, Small Cell Forum and TM Forum.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion Microsoft Surface Phone News and Updates: Release Date Delayed Again? Business and Productivity Features Revealed By Christian Ver Marcelo Oct 6, 2016 | 1:56 AM Undoubtedly one of the most anticipated phone launches of the year, Microsoft is expected to unveil the new Surface Phones. However, with no confirmed release dates, excited fans keep on guessing when they could get their hands on the new device. Release Date Delayed Again Earlier reports have speculated that the Surface Phones will be released along with the Surface Pro 5 and the new desktop All in One from Microsoft. Microsoft is set to hold an event this month, with various tech blogs and fans predicting the launch of these devices. However, rumors have been increasing that the Surface Phones would not be launching together with the other Surface devices. This may largely be due to the fact that Intel has pulled out indefinitely from the mobile market. With Microsoft intending to incorporate Intel Kaby Lake chipsets in the Surface Phones, the company may be facing a challenge due to the pull out. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit The earliest release date predicted for the Surface Phones is set sometime in 2017. This would make logical sense as it would give Microsoft enough time to acquire new chipset partnerships. This could also give Intel enough leeway to finish the Redstone processor in time for the release. Business and Productivity While the chipset is currently the subject of much controversy, other details and specifications of the Surface Phones have been rounding up the web. First off is the three variant scheme to be followed by Microsoft. There would be a basic model and a business model. The other variant still does not have any confirmed details. With Microsoft always gearing their products and services toward productivity, the Surface Phone is no different. The upcoming phones are reportedly going to target the enterprise sector, with at least one of the phone variants equipped with business-centric features. It is no secret that the Windows environment will make its way to the Surface Phone. However, the full extent of its mobile capability will be enhanced with major improvements and changes to be implemented in the new devices. Deeper integration with desktop and tablet devices would be heavily emphasized throughout the interface to define the Surface Phones' productivity features. Other Specs and Features The very capable Snapdragon 830 is the most likely candidate to power the device if Intel does not come through. This chipset, coupled with at least 3GB of RAM for the base model, 6GB for the next tier, and 8GB for the highest end variant, would deliver the smoothest performance in any device. Other specs such as the camera, the Continuum, the battery, and even the displays themselves would enhance the overall efficiency of every user. The only question now is whether Microsoft could still penetrate the smartphone market which is currently saturated with premium phones and phablets. With the right price, specs, and features, the Surface Phone might just be able to stand against the other smartphone giants.

 Execs from Facebook, Google, and Microsoft explain why they use Israel for their R&D Sam Shead Oct. 6, 2016, 3:30 AM 56,218 facebook linkedin twitter email print The beachfront in Tel Aviv, Israel.Flickr/Ilan's Photos Born just 68 years ago, Israel has developed a reputation as one of the world's most innovative tech hubs. Silicon Valley multinationals in particular have cottoned on, setting up offices in the region and acquiring numerous Israeli startups. Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Intel are among more than 300 multinationals that have opened up research-and-development facilities in the country, which is home to just 9 million people. But what is it that makes Israel such a hotbed of innovation? Executives from each of the aforementioned US tech giants gave an audience of about 300 tech workers an insight during the DLD Innovation conference in Tel Aviv last week. Google's garage in the Middle East Google developer partner advocate Don Dodge said: "My job at Google is to travel all over the world and talk to developers and startups and investors. I've been to every corner of the earth. China, Japan, Australia, all of Europe, the Nordics, everywhere. There is no other country on earth that thinks the same way that we [Google] do like Israel does. "Israel truly is the 'Startup Nation.' You think like us. You break things, you make things, you're creative. It's special." Google, headquartered in Mountain View, California, first opened an office in Israel back in 2006, when the search giant was still something of a startup at just five years old. Google now employs more than 600 engineers in the country, and they work on several of Google's core products, including Search, Maps, and Live Results. About half of Google's engineers in Israel are graduates of Tel Aviv University, Dodge said. "There's an amazing source of talent here," he said. Google's office in Tel Aviv.Itay Sikolski Dodge said cheaper engineers in places like Russia, India, and China were often not as good: "It's about innovation, creativity, taking tremendous risks, understanding how to get to market. That's what Israel does. It's not about the cost." Google also has a dedicated startup space in Tel Aviv known as "Campus," which provides entrepreneurs with a place to start and grow their businesses. When an Israeli startup gets Google's attention, Google will move in and try to acquire it, drawing on the talent and expertise in that startup for future products and services. For example, it acquired the Israeli security startup SlickLogin, reportedly with the view to integrate its technology into its two-step verification process. "We've made a lot of investments in companies in Israel and we've acquired five of them," Dodge said. "Waze was the biggest at over $1 billion, and it was a great investment." Facebook focuses on the flip-flops Adi Soffer Teeni, the CEO of Facebook Israel, said the Palo Alto, California-based company first landed in Israel three years ago and now has a "small" R&D team in the country, in addition to a team that works directly with entrepreneurs in the local tech ecosystem. Facebook Israel CEO Adi Soffer Teeni.Flickr/DLD She said Facebook's engineering team in Israel recently played a key role on one of Facebook's most recent products, without naming exactly what that product was. When the moderator asked what made Israel such a unique place to do R&D, Teeni responded: "There's amazing talent here. Multinationals come here with great R&D centres and recruit people with a very innovative way of thinking." Teeni also stressed that the mentality and culture at Facebook's R&D centre in Israel was comparable to Facebook's R&D facilities in Silicon Valley, where engineers "move fast and break things" while wearing "shorts and flip-flops." "Something is happening here in Israel," she said. "There's a magic and it's not easy to explain what it is, but Israel's a playground where it feels like home for the multinational." Teeni also issued a warning to those working in Israel's well-established tech industry, saying other so-called startup nations were cropping up across Europe, perhaps referring to tech hubs such as London, Berlin, Stockholm, and Paris. She urged Israeli startups and engineers to get serious and focus on maturing their companies to stay ahead of the pack. Intel looks for ingenuity in Israeli startups Roy Ramon, the managing director of the Intel Ingenuity Partner Programme, said Intel was one of the biggest employers in Israel, with 11,000 workers across the country. The chip manufacturer first set up shop in Israel some 40 years ago, and it now operates several sites across the region, including a startup scouting ground. Ramon spoke proudly of the Israeli "chutzpah," a Yiddish word that derives from the Hebrew word ḥutspâ (חֻצְפָּה), meaning "insolence," "cheek," or "audacity." In business, the word is often used to describe an individual's self-confidence, and Ramon said it's a useful "tool" that Israelis have at their disposal. "The reason I started the startup programme is because when you [a corporate] meet with a company in Israel, they come in and tell engineers that they're doing it all wrong," he said. "They push everything off the table. These engineers have been doing this for years. They're world experts. And yet that startup is bold enough to come to a mammoth like Intel and say you're doing it all wrong. This is one culture that you can't get anywhere in the world." Microsoft's machine-learning mission Israel's cafe culture acts as a breeding ground for startups.Flickr/israeltourism Zack Weisfeld, the general manager of Microsoft Global Accelerators, said Microsoft had grown its R&D team in Israel to about 1,000 people since it opened up its first office in the country 25 years ago. "It's the first R&D centre we opened anywhere in the world outside of Redmond," he said. Weisfeld told Business Insider during an interview that a lot of "deep tech" was happening in Israel, adding that Microsoft was keen to work with the startups — and possibly acquire some — that are leading the way in fields such as artificial intelligence. "Most of the founders we see [in Israel] come deeply from the tech world and don’t come from the business world trying to solve a problem and then finding a technical cofounder," he said. "They really have a lot of IP (intellectual property) in the space and now they're putting it to play in all categories: agriculture, robots, health." Weisfeld added: "There is something about the culture, and something about the market understanding and business understanding that might be a little more rough [among Israeli startups] at the beginning, but at the end of the day, and if you get them to the right place, they're unstoppable." Some of the others The likes of Amazon and Apple are also developing new technologies in Israel R&D centres, albeit a bit more quietly. An Apple employee told Business Insider outside Apple's R&D centre — situated approximately 15 kilometers north of Tel Aviv — that Apple engineers in Israel were working on hardware for the "iPhone 8." There are about 800 employees at Apple's Herzliya R&D centre, which is about four years old and overseen in part by Johny Srouji, the senior vice president of hardware at Apple. Srouji gave Bloomberg a small insight into what happens in Apple's Israel R&D centre in February. The office was set up after Apple acquired two startups: the flash memory designer Anobit in 2012 and the 3D sensor developer PrimeSense in 2013. Apple has since acquired the Israeli camera firm LinX. Sources close to Apple said the company used the R&D facility in Herzliya to develop hardware such as chips, storage, cameras, and wireless technologies. Apple CEO Tim Cook said during a trip to Israel in 2015 that the Herzliya office was Apple's second-largest R&D facility in the world, according to The Times of Israel. Amazon also has an R&D presence in Israel. The company declined to say how many workers it had on the ground, but it did say they work on Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud business, and a range other other Amazon R&D projects. It also acquired the Israeli chipmaker Annapurna Labs in 2015 for a reported $350 million (£275 million).

At his “Room Tone” show, premiering September 30th at the Spring/Summer 2017 Fashion Week in Paris, the designer used belts and glasses, powered by Intel’s Curie module, to express the models’ stress levels. During the show, five different models wore the Curie-powered smart belts and glasses, which measured and processed their stress level, then interpreted it into a visual projection on the runway wall. The glasses gather biometric data using a variety of sensors, and, using the Curie chip’s bluetooth capabilities, are transferred to the wearer’s 3D printed belt, which projects the visual translation onto the wall. The glasses were built with EEG electrodes on the temples to read asymmetrical brainwave activity, while the nose bridge houses an optical heart rate sensor and a microphone to detect breathing rates. Like the smart glasses, Chalayan’s belts are also supported with Curie. In addition to an Intel Compute Stick, which enables the belt to process and visualize the smart glasses’ bio-metrics, the belt houses a pico projector. The show explored themes relating to technology and human emotion, highlighting London’s contemporary politics with a series of voiceover commentaries. Hussein Chalayan worked with Intel to show that technology could be a vehicle to better peoples’ lives. The multinational tech company, known for its computer processors, has been exploring new, wearable outlets to showcase its technology. Intel’s Curie module, used in Chalayan’s collection, is a tiny, feature packed chip providing support to low-power wearables. The module can be incorporated into a variety of objects–and Intel’s IQ Software Kit encourages fashion, sports and lifestyle companies to develop smart, wearable designs. Though the apparel’s clunky, heavy aesthetic may not be suited for retail outlets, Hussein Chalayan hopes that the collaboration will live on even after Fashion Week in Paris ends. It may not be too far off that clothes will provide physical form and function, as well as tools for emotional stability.

Intel Kaby Lake Review: What optimization can do for a 14nm CPU There's no die shrink, but Intel's 7th-gen chip brings both a decent performance boost and buttery-smooth support for advanced video playback. Gordon Mah Ung (PC World (US online)) on 05 October, 2016 21:00 0 - - - - print email When Intel’s Kaby Lake CPU arrived at our doorstep in the form of Dell’s XPS 13 laptop, it was wrapped in foreboding. Hardware fans have long been in denial about the inevitable end of Moore’s Law. With Kaby Lake, Intel’s abandoned its relentless “tick-tock” march in favor of a slower “process-architecture-optimize” stroll. Semiconductor doomsday seemed nigh. Kaby Lake is the first CPU produced under Intel’s new plan. The plan started with a “tock”—a CPU shrink (22nm Haswell to 14nm Broadwell), then a “tick” of efficiency improvement (14nm Broadwell to 14nm Skylake). Intel wasn’t ready to produce another tock yet, though. Instead we got a second tick, an “optimized” 14nm Kaby Lake. The question is whether there really is much improvement from Skylake to Kaby Lake, or is Intel just stalling while it looks for a way to stretch Moore’s Law even further. I can say now that it’s a decent step forward. To find out just how much you get and where it’s from, you’ll have to read on. Gordon Mah Ung Intel’s 7th-gen Kaby Lake is built on a 14nm process similar to that of Skylake CPUs, but manufacturing tweaks give it a performance boost, the company says. How we tested A laptop CPU is inherently more difficult to review than a desktop CPU. You can’t isolate a laptop CPU like a desktop CPU—it’s part of a complete package. Each laptop vendor makes different performance decisions for thermals, power and weight, so it can be hard to suss out the CPU’s impact unless the laptops are exactly the same. Otherwise, you’re really comparing laptop A with laptop B. Fortunately, I had access to three generations of Dell’s excellent XPS 13. They’re not identical, of course, but they’re close enough that the comparison has some validity. I purposely selected tests that will minimize those differences. Meet the XPS 13s Gordon Mah Ung Kaby Lake, Skylake, and Broadwell power these three generations of XPS 13 laptops. The newest XPS 13 costs $1,100. It’s equipped with a 7th-gen Kaby Lake Core i5-7200U, 8GB of LPDDR/1866 in dual-channel mode; a 1920x1080, non-touch, IPS panel; and a 256GB Lite-On NVME M.2 SSD. I reviewed its predecessor last year. It has a 6th-gen Skylake Core i5-6200U, 8GB of LPDDR3/1866, a 1920x1080, non-touch, IPS panel and a 256GB NVMe M.2 Samsung SSD. Then there’s the original XPS 13, configured with a 5th-gen Broadwell Core i5-5200U. Because it was the entry-level model, it had 4GB of DDR3/1600RS in dual-channel mode and a 128GB M.2 SATA drive. It also had a 1920x1080, non-touch IPS panel. Prior to testing, all three laptops were reset, and all three were updated with the same Windows 10 version (OS 1607 Build 1493.222). All three also had the latest drivers and BIOSes applied from Dell’s support site. If your PC world tends to swing desktop, know that what we’re only looking at laptop Kaby Lake performance. Desktop CPUs (and quad-core laptop chips) are due early next year. Consider what you see here a preview of what you might see with the upcoming desktop CPUs. Gordon Mah Ung Three generations of XPS 13 laptops: On the left is the 1st-gen Broadwell. On the right is 2nd-gen Skylake, and in the middle is the latest: A 3rd-gen Kaby Lake version. Three 14nm CPUs enter a bar... Unlike previous generations, Intel now has three CPUs built on its 14nm process. I’ve lined up the comparative details from Intel’s ARK page. I’ve also included the Core i7-6560U chip used in the gold XPS 13 that occasionally appears in my benchmark charts. If you look at the specs below, you can find the main performance advantage Kaby Lake has—clock speed. Kaby Lake cores are, for the most part, identical to Skylake cores. By massaging the 14nm process squeeze out a CPU that can hit higher clock speeds. For example, where 6th gen Broadwell Core i5-6200U maxes out at 2.8GHz, 7th-gen Kaby Lake can hit 3.1GHz. So what does that 10 percent increase in clock give you? Let’s find out. Cinebench R15 multi-threaded performance First up is Cinebench R15. This test is based on Maxon’s real-world rendering engine and is a pure CPU test. That roughly 10-percent clock speed advantage the current Core i5-7200U has over the prior Core i5-6200U results in roughly a 10 percent bump. With the older Broadwell-based Core i5-5200, the gap widens to 20 percent. As for the gold XPS 13, you'd think its Intel Core i7-6560U and Iris 540 graphics core, with the ability to hit a maximum of 3.2GHz, would prove slightly faster than the Kaby Lake version, but it’s not. In fact, it’s slightly slower. I think the Kaby Lake Core i5 with its improved process is able to run at its highest clock speed speed for longer than the Skylake Core i7. That’s another testament to Intel’s “optimize” step. The 7th gen Kaby Lake Core i5 unit is surprisingly faster than the Core i7 by a smidge. Geekbench 4.01 performance While Maxon’s Cinebench R15 is based on a 3D rendering engine the company sells, Geekbench is a synthetic test that tries to simulate what it believes are real-world workloads. The test isn’t without controversy, but much of that is due to Primate Lab’s attempts to make it a usable cross-platform tool that would let you compare an iPad Pro to a PC. When you get involved in the quasi-religious wars between tech tribes, expect mudslinging. I won’t re-litigate the politics of it here, but the good news is Geekbench 4.01 is completely new, and Primate Labs seems to have taken much of the criticism to heart. Geekbench 4.01 tests cryptography, integer, floating point and memory tests. As I didn’t have Geekbench 4.01 for the gold XPS 13, I’ve omitted that laptop. The result is an unsurprising 11 percent performance difference. Moving on to the Broadwell XPS 13, Kaby Lake shows a very respectable 24 percent improvement in performance. That pretty much echoes what I’m seeing elsewhere. Geekbench 4.01 shows the 7th-gen Kaby Lake also ahead of the 6th-gen Skylake by a reasonable margin. Handbrake Encoding Performance Moving on to our final CPU-centric test, we use the free and popular Handbrake encoder to transcode a 30GB 1080P MKV file using the Android Preset. The test is mostly CPU-limited and loves multiple cores. On most ultrabooks, we use it as both a performance and thermal soak test to find out what happens to a laptop when it’s forced to heat up the the CPU for almost two hours. Typically, this is where you see the limits of the laptop’s cooling system. Performance often falls off as the it heats up—or the fans get loud. Historically, Dell’s XPS 13s have done really in this test, and that’s because Dell generally isn’t afraid to make a little noise in favor of performance. The results for the 5th-gen Broadwell and 6th-gen Skylake are as expected, with the 7th-gen Kaby Lake coming in about 11 percent faster than 6th-gen and the 24 percent faster than 5th gen. As for the gold XPS 13 with its Skylake Core i7-6560U. Despite having a higher maximum clockspeed of 3.2GHz, the Core i7 actually finishes slightly slower than the Core i5 unit. This seems to back up up my suspicion that the Kaby Lake Core i5, with its “optimized” process, can sit at higher clock speeds far longer than the Skylake Core i7 chip. It’s no surprise that the Kaby Lake CPU aces both its Skylake and Broadwell siblings by a reasonable amount. The surprise is beating the Core i7 Skylake chip. 3DMark Cloud Gate Graphics performance I didn’t get too heavy into the gaming performance of Kaby Lake, because like the CPU side, it’s very similar. The Kaby Lake chip has Intel HD 620 graphics, with 24 execution units and clock speeds of 300MHz to 1,050MHz. That probably sounds pretty similar to what you got out of Skylake’s Intel HD 520, which has 24 execution units and a clock speed range of 300MHz to 1,050MHz To gauge the performance of the laptops, I used Futuremark’s 3DMark Cloud Gate. It’s a synthetic benchmark, but its value lies in being a neutral title that doesn’t favor any particular vendor’s optimizations. The Cloud Gate test is well suited for integrated graphics gaming, too. In 3DMark, Kaby Lake comes in just 7 percent faster over the comparable Skylake chip. Over Broadwell’s Intel HD 5500, though, you get a very respectable 27 percent difference. Based on a 3DMark Cloud Score from the gold XPS 13 with Core i7-6560U chip. You can see where the Iris 540 graphics and its embedded 64MB of eDRAM pay real dividends. One thing that should be said: Intel says Kaby Lake graphics can play some eSports-level games at 30 fps with resolutions and settings turned down. It's nice that you’re getting near Iris-level performance in a standard CPU, but if games are going to be something of a focus in your laptop, get one with a discrete graphics chip (and with a Kaby Lake chip too). Using the graphics test of 3Dmark Cloud Gate, Kaby Lake is faster but not by quite the same margin over Skylake. The 64MB eDRAM cache in the Core i7 also pays off handsomely. Battery life is better, maybe One of the more difficult tests in a laptop is comparing battery consumption of different CPUs. Ideally, you’d test a laptop and then swap the CPU out and test again. That world doesn’t really exist anymore, because all of Intel’s mobile CPUs are soldered to the motherboard. The best-case scenario is what I have today. It’s not perfect but still an interesting comparison to make. In the interest of full disclosure though, I should mention there are key some key differences. Dell uses cells that are physically the same size, but due to denser batteries has increased the capacity. The Skylake-based XPS 13 has a 57,532 watt-hour battery, while the Kaby Lake-based XPS 13 has a 59,994 watt-hour battery. The other key difference, which may matter more, is the SSD. Both have 256GB SSD’s but the brands and rated power consumption are different. The Skylake unit has a Samsung PM951 NVMe drive which can use up to 4.5 watts, while the Kaby Lake unit has a Lite-On CX2 which absolutely sips power at 1.32 watts under load. What’s not clear is whether the Samsung drive is using a full 4.5 watts while being read from, or if that’s only a worst-case scenario. Ideally, both would have the same drive, but that’s out of my hands today. At least both pack 8GB of LPDDR3/1866. For our rundown test, I stuck with our standard workload, which is to play the open source Tears of Steel using Windows 10 Movies and TV with the brightness set to around 255 nits. Audio was on using a pair of ear buds and the tests were conducted in airplane mode. The result? The Kaby Lake in the 3rd-gen XPS 13 gives you an hour's more battery life than the Skylake version. Because these are laptops I can’t separate the CPU's role from the battery's, but at least we’re not going backwards. The Kaby Lake XPS 13 gives up slightly better battery life than the Skylake XPS 13, but other factors contribute to that outcome. Greatly improved video engine You know Kaby Lake’s magic on the CPU side is mostly a clock speed bump. Graphics? Another bump. The big upgrade is to the video engine, where Intel added a wealth of hardware support for such things as VP9 at 4K resolution and 10-bit color support for HEVC. To find out the practical upshot I used an Intel-supplied 10-bit HEVC file at 4K resolution. The file was actually the same open-source Tears of Steel video, but encoded at a 10-bit color depth. Using the same settings for the previous battery run-down test I wanted to see how much that hardware support for 10-bit HEVC mattered. As it turns out, it matters a lot. ,Battery life during playback of 10-bit HEVC video barely dented the Kaby Lake XPS 13 thanks to its hardware support. I can’t say the same for the Skylake XPS 13. As you can see, the Kaby Lake XPS 13's battery life is just over 10 hours. On the Skylake XPS 13, you take a yuge hit with Skylake tapping out at just under three hours. Ouch. Kaby Lake's dedicated hardware for playing back 10-bit HEVC on the graphics cores means the CPU can sit idle most of the time during playback. Skylake doesn’t have the same video hardware support, so decoding of that 10-bit content is shifted to the CPU cores, which must run at at far higher speeds to process it. The more you use the CPU, the more power you use. As a comparison test, I downloaded a pair of videos encoded in HEVC at 10-bit color depth from Jelly.fish.us. The files are provided so people can test network streaming performance. I didn’t stream them though--I just played the files directly from the SSD using Movies and TV. In this first screenshot you can see the Kaby Lake XPS 13 playing the 1080p version of the 10-bit HEVC file. Because the GPU is doing all of the work, the CPU is basically idling. With hardware acceleration of 10-bit HEVC video, the 7th-gen Kaby Lake Core i5-7200U is buttery-smooth playing both 1080p and 4K video. In the next screenshot, you can see the same file being played on the Skylake XPS 13 in Movies and TV. It’s pretty apparent what’s using all the power on the Skylake XPS 13: The CPU is working hard to decode that 10-bit content, and with both cores running at 2.7GHz during the playback. What’s worse: Rhe Skylake XPS 13 constantly drops frames even with the CPU running at near top speed. To put a finer point on it: The Kaby Lake XPS 13 can play the file at 4K resolution with 10-bit color and HEVC and still cruise, while the Skylake XPS 13 can barely play the 1080p version. Ouch. Intel says you can expect similar results for Google’s VP9 video too using the Chrome browser. VP9 is a video codec Google supports and how it encodes all videos on Youtube. I tried replicating Intel’s tests using Chrome on Youtube but didn’t have the network bandwidth at home to reliably stream two 4K VP9 videos simultaneously (one to each laptop). I see no reason to doubt Intel’s claims, though, as the claim about 10-bit content in HEVC is pretty crystal-clear. One thing that should be pointed out: 10-bit content is very rare today. One area I think it does matter though, is in HTPC use. If I were building or buying a machine to run my 4K-and-up television, I’d want Kaby Lake over Skylake in a heartbeat. This 1080p HEVC file encoded with 10-bit color depth will drag a Skylake Core i5-6200U to the ground. Conclusion In the end, Kaby Lake is a decent step forward. Is it as exciting as reading about a 10nm-based CPU? No. But it does deliver a margin of improvement that’s actually in line with the evolutionary steps that what we’ve seen from the last few generations of chips. Haswell to Broadwell gave us maybe 10 percent. Going from Broadwell to Skylake yielded similar results. Does it mean dump your Skylake laptop and rush out to buy a Kaby Lake laptop? No, not at all. However, when you’re looking at a 20 to 25 percent difference between Kaby Lake and Broadwell, then you start to wonder. As you get to Haswell, where it probably opens up to 30 to 35 percent, or Ivy Bridge and even Sandy Bridge, then yes, an upgrade would be a game-changer. Gordon Mah Ung Yes, you’d rather be reading about a 10nm CPU, but you build your PC with the chip you have, not the chip you wished you had.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 5, 2016 at 9:23PM Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) recently partnered with eyewear giant Luxottica's (NYSE:LUX) Oakley brand to launch Radar Pace, a pair of smartglasses designed for athletes. The Radar Pace features personalized training programs, tracks heart rate and performance, and guides athletes with a real-time voice activated coaching system. The Radar Pace. Image source: Oakley. The "coach" is powered by Intel's Real Speech voice recognition system, and athletes can use the integrated Bluetooth headset to make calls, dictate texts, or listen to music. But will these new smartglasses succeed where Alphabet's Google Glass failed? Or will it remain another niche product in the market of pricey wearables? Why Intel is making smartglasses Intel's partnership with Luxottica isn't its first major move into the wearables market. It previously developed a $1,000 luxury bracelet called MICA with high-end retailer Opening Ceremony, partnered with Fossil to develop fitness trackers and smartwatches, developed biometric earbuds which measure a user's heart rate with SMS Audio, and acquired wearables maker Basis Science to launch the Basis Peak smartwatch. Intel made all those moves for two main reasons. First, it had to diversify away from the slowing PC and data center markets by expanding into adjacent markets like wearables, connected cars, smart appliances, and other Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets. Second, it needed to widen its moat against ARM licensees like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), which dominated the smartphone and tablet markets and threatens to do the same in the IoT market. Unfortunately for Intel, the numbers suggest that ARM chips are already winning that battle. Earlier this year, Qualcomm declared that it already controlled "more than 80%" of the Android Wear market. Apple Watch, the world's most popular smartwatch, also runs on a custom ARM chip, while Google Glass was powered by an ARM chipset from Texas Instruments. Google Glass. Image source: Google. In response, Intel has launched a wide variety of low-power chipsets and modules, like the SD card-sized Edison and button-sized Curie, for IoT and wearable devices. It even launched a TV show, America's Greatest Makers, to promote those chips. Yet Intel's IoT revenue rose just 2% annually, and accounted for just 4% of its sales last quarter -- indicating that they won't offset its weaker PC chip sales anytime soon. What this deal means for Luxottica The Radar Pace is much less meaningful for Luxottica, which controls roughly 80% of the eyewear market with its first-party brands Ray-Ban, Oakley, and Persol; its licensed eyewear for top brands like Chanel, DKNY, and Ralph Lauren; and its brick-and-mortar retailers LensCrafters, Pearle Vision, and Sunglass Hut. Oakley is one of Luxottica's top brands, but a single pair of smartglasses probably won't move the needle very much for its parent company. Therefore, I believe that Oakley's Radar Pace is more of an experimental play which complements the brand's other "high-tech" glasses. Those glasses include its Airwave ski goggles, which features a heads-up display with GPS, jump tracking, caller ID, and text messaging features, and its Thump MP3 glasses. Pursuing niche users instead of mainstream ones Google Glass failed because people didn't like to be secretly recorded, and the design looked awkward. Snap is taking another stab at the market with its new Spectacles, but that device could also flop due to the same challenges. That's why other companies are now targeting niche markets instead of pursuing mainstream users. Sony's SmartEyeglass and Microsoft's HoloLens, for example, are initially targeting enterprise users to make their jobs easier. Intel and Oakley's Radar Pace also follows that example by targeting hardcore athletes and outdoor enthusiasts. It's unclear how many "high tech" glasses Oakley has sold, but it's been selling the Thump since 2004 and the Airwave since 2012 -- indicating that the same customers might embrace the Radar Pace.

Solus Is Getting Optimus Support, AMD Hybrid Configuration Support Coming Soon Exclusive GO As part of a standardized and cross-platform implementation Oct 6, 2016 01:45 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  If you have a computer with an AMD hybrid configuration with Intel HD integrated graphics, and you're running the newest GNU/Linux distributions, chances are the AMD Radeon GPU is not properly supported. It just happens that we have an Acer laptop that features such hybrid configuration, and we're using the latest Ubuntu 16.10 (Yakkety Yak) operating system on it, which should be officially launched on October 13, 2016. We did an upgrade from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus), but things have not improved at all. The problem is with AMD, which no longer offers a graphics driver for its older Radeon GPUs, such as the AMD Radeon HD 8750M (with 2 GB RAM) we're running on said laptop. It's a four-year-old GPU, but according to this notebookcheck.net benchmark, it's decent to run some nice games from two-three years ago, better than the integrated Intel GPU. So not only that you won't have control over the discrete AMD graphics card, you'll have to open a terminal emulator and run the "DRI_PRIME=1 program" command (where 'program' is the executable of a certain application, e.g. DRI_PRIME=1 steam) to use an app with it. All good, running the respective command is not so much of a hustle these days, especially that you can add some workarounds to make those apps to always run with the dedicated GPU, but the real problem here is that the open-source amdgpu and radeon drivers integrated into the kernel offer a poor experience. Here's how the Solus developers are helping fix the problem We all know by now that the Solus development team have been doing a great job lately with their rolling operating system, bringing you all the latest software versions and GNU/Linux technologies as soon as they're out, but they are also working to make the Open Source and Linux community a better place. They've provided us with the excellent Linux Steam Integration project that aims to better integrate the Steam client into various GNU/Linux operating systems, and they are now promising to bring full support for Optimus configurations (systems with Nvidia hybrid discrete graphics) to Solus users. And they won't stop there, as Solus Project leader Ikey Doherty tells us in a recent conversation that the team is working hard on a new project, called linux-driver-management, which promises to offer cross-distribution graphics support for multiple vendors and hybrid configurations, including AMD, and finally plug this gap in the Linux world. "The initial version of the tooling will focus on enabling a mutually exclusive configuration change, i.e. switching between the on-board and dedicated for all graphical operations for the duration of the uptime," says Ikey Doherty exclusively for Softpedia. "Once that groundwork has been laid, we'll incorporate dynamic switching between the onboard and dedicated GPU, with a view to per-app configuration being eventually supported." The linux-driver-management project, when it's ready to take over our Linux desktops, will replace the in-house built DoFlicky and gl-driver-switch tools for the Solus operating system. It will also be accompanied by a standardized library providing core discover-ability and configuration for hybrid graphics configurations. More details can be found at https://github.com/solus-project/linux-driver-management#rationale.

The ‘Intel She Will Connect Mobile App’ is a platform for women and girls to learn how to use mobile devices, personal computers (PCs) and the internet safely. The key highlights of ‘Intel She Will Connect Mobile App’ include the step-by-step approach with interactive activities and simulations on how to use a computer and mobile phone; an introduction on how to use the internet to research health and wellness information, education, and starting a business; Inspirational stories from women on how technology is enhancing their lives; valuable tips on Internet safety and social media usage like Facebook. It is designed for women in sub-Saharan Africa who are new to digital devices and the internet. Speaking on the usefulness of the app at a ‘She Will Connect Mobile App’ hands-on-session in Lagos recently, Intel Digital Empowerment Director for Community Education, Marne Dunn, stated that research has shown that there is a huge digital divide in technology and there are 25 per cent less women online in developing countries and the number rises to 43 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa. “To help bridge the existing digital divide, the Intel She Will Connect Awareness App was created, and it is a fantastic tool that NGOs, individuals and even schools especially in rural areas can adopt to educate girls on digital literacy,” Marne said. According to Marne, “The ‘She Will Connect Awareness App’ is a perfect app for women to learn how to use mobile devices, PCs, and the Internet safely. This app aims to promote gender equality through awareness, basic education, and sharing inspirational stories of women who have benefited greatly by connecting to the Internet. This app includes easy-to-understand learning instructions, clean modern visuals, educational games, and useful tips.” The ‘She Will Connect Mobile App’ can be downloaded from the Google Play App store on any Android device and can be used seamlessly without internet access once downloaded.

This will mark the second consecutive year of decline. The global devices market fell by 0.75 percent in 2015. "The global devices market is not on pace to return to single-digit growth soon," said Ranjit Atwal, research director at Gartner. Growth is on pace to remain flat during the next five years. All segments are expected to decline in 2016, except for premium ultramobiles and utility mobile phones (entry level phones), which are expected to show single-digit growth this year. "We expect premium ultramobiles will start benefiting from the collective performance and integration of the latest Intel CPU platform and Windows 10," added Mr. Atwal. Table 1.

"The effect of currency depreciation on the market is diminishing," added Mr. Atwal. "The second quarter of 2016 was the first since the second quarter of 2015 least impacted by currency depreciation." Regions such as Western Europe, where the Euro depreciated significantly in 2015 and PC prices increased, finally showed flat market growth (-0.9 percent) in the second quarter of 2016. This follows four consecutive quarters of decline. If this situation prevails it means that PC sales will bottom out in 2016. However, the PC market in Western Europe remains difficult following the Brexit vote. "Device vendors are mitigating the currency depreciation of the pound in two ways first, they are taking advantage of the likelihood of a single-digit decline in PC component costs in 2016," said Mr. Atwal. "Second, they will "de-feature" their PCs to keep prices down. With these changes, Gartner expects PC prices in the UK to increase by less than 10 percent in 2017." For the PC market to stay on pace for flat growth in 2017, business spending needs to flourish. "The inventory of Windows 8 PCs should have been cleared, and large businesses in mature markets are now looking to move to Windows 10 through 2018," added Mr. Atwal. "In addition, more affordable hardware and increasingly available virtual reality content (such as games, stories and other entertainment) will enable consumer PC buyers to upgrade in order to experience immersive offerings. Smartphone Growth to Continue Slowing Down in 2016 Total mobile phone shipments are on pace to decline 1.6 percent in 2016. The smartphone segment continues to grow, albeit more slowly than in previous years, and is expected to reach 1.5 billion units in 2016. "This is no surprise; the smartphone market is maturing, and reaching global saturation with phones that are increasingly capable and remain good enough for longer," said Roberta Cozza, research director at Gartner. In 2016, the Android market will continue to be bolstered by Chinese vendors offering more affordable premium devices. Despite the availability of the iPhone 7, Gartner expects a weaker year-over-year volume performance from Apple in 2016, as volumes stabilize after a very strong 2015. As a result, Gartner expects total smartphone market to only increase 4.5 percent with premium smartphones declining 1.1 percent in 2016. "We expect the market for premium smartphones to return to 3.5 per cent growth in 2017, as stronger replacement cycles kick in and in anticipation of a new iPhone next year, which is expected to offer a new design and new features that are attractive enough to convince more replacement buyers," said Ms. Cozza.

Roston - Oct 7, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Gigabyte has a new array of “Brix” miniature PCs that sport Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors, giving consumers a very-small-form-factor way to use the hardware. These Brix units are, as the name suggests, shaped relatively like bricks and they’re not much larger at only 4.7″ x 4.4″ x 1.4-inches (starting size). Consumers can choose from the latest Intel Core i3, i5, and i7 processors. It appears Gigabyte is offering these desktops as barebones systems, meaning they come with certain hardware — like the processor — but leave the rest up to you. With the GB-BKi3HA-7100 model, there’s support for 2.5-inch SSD/HDD storage drives, a pair of SO-DIMM DDR4 slots, and a single M.2 SSD 2280 slot. As far as other hardware is concerned, there’s an Intel IEEE 802.11ac dual-band WiFi card wth Bluetooth 4.2 and Intel HD Graphics 620. These are joined by a pair of USB 3.0 ports and a pair of USB 3.1 ports (aka, USB Type-C). There’s also HDMI 2.0 for video-out and HDMI with Mini DisplayPort, thusly support for dual-display setups. Finally, the new Brix mini computers include Intel Gigabit lan, a combination microphone and headphone jack, and a VESA mounting bracket for mounting purposes. Gigabyte’s website does not list device availability or pricing at this time.

Performance-Boosting HiZ Support Lands For Intel's Mesa Vulkan Driver Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 7 October 2016 at 04:13 PM EDT. 1 Comment Intel's "ANV" Mesa Vulkan Linux driver now has basic support for HiZ, an important performance feature. A while back I wrote about Intel Vulkan driver HiZ patches that were on the mailing list while today they were merged into Mesa Git -- in time for next week's feature freeze for the next Mesa mailing list. So far Hierarchical-Z is only implemented for basic cases, but in those basic triangle-type Vulkan demos there is about a 15% performance boost and around a 30% performance boost for the demos making use of fast depth clears. For now the HiZ ANV Vulkan implementation probably won't translate into any real performance gains for Linux's current Vulkan games: Dota 2 and The Talos Princple, but nevertheless great to see the basic support hitting Git. 1 Comment Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Wacom MobileStudio Pro is for you, then. Coming this November, these lightweight, mobile, pen-equipped computers are available in two sizes, one with a 13.3-inch display and the other with a 15.6-inch display. Of the new product, Ed Neumann, Senior Vice President of Wacom's Creative Branded Business says, "Unlike most general-purpose mobile tablets created for the mass market, Wacom's MobileStudio Pro was designed specifically for the needs of the creative professional and how they work...[MobileStudio Pro] provides the best, most natural and precise creative experience imaginable." The computers are available in a wide variety of configurations, but they all run Windows 10 and utilize the new Wacom Pro Pen 2. Regarding the Pro Pen 2, itself, it offers a wealth of performance improvements over previous Wacom pens. It is four times more pressure sensitive and accurate than the original Pro Pen, has "virtually no lag," offers natural tilt support, no parallax and doesn't require batteries or recharging. There are four MobileStudio Pro 13 models and two Pro 16 models. In the 13.3-inch models, two utilize Intel i5 processors while the other two come with i7 processors. All four 13-inch computers come with Intel Iris 550 graphics processing units (GPUs). All four have WQHD (2560 x 1440) resolution displays that offer 150cd/m2 brightness and can display 96% of the Adobe RGB color gamut. They include UHS-II Micro SD slots and a trio of USB-C ports. Full pricing is not yet available, but the 13-inch models start at around US$1,400 (4GB of RAM and 64GB solid state drive (SSD) storage). The 13-inch model can be upgraded to include 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. As mentioned above, there are two 15.6-inch MobileStudio Pro models, as well. One comes with an i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, 256GB SSD and an NVidia Quadro M600M GPU with 2GB of VRAM. The Intel i7-powered top-end model costs just under US$3,000 and has 16GB of RAM, 512GB of SSD storage and an NVidia M1000M GPU that has 4GB of VRAM. The 15.6-inch display has 4K UHD resolution (3840 x 2160) and displays 94% of the Adobe RGB color gamut, which is slightly less than its smaller sibling, but it does have a 1000:1 contrast ratio versus the 800:1 contrast found in the MobileStudio Pro 13 models. All of the 13-inch and 15-inch models have a 5-megapixel front camera and 8-megapixel rear camera, but the premium 15.6-inch computer has an Intel RealSense R200 3D scanning camera, letting you scan real-world objects into 3D modeling software.   Wacom MobileStudio Pro 16 There are a variety of accessories available for the Wacom MobileStudio Pro as well, including a wireless keyboard and mobile stand, which lets users switch between three different drawing angles. There is also a Wacom Link available. When connected to a compatible Mac or PC, you can use the MobileStudio Pro as a standard Cintiq tablet. For much more information on the new computers from Wacom, including physical dimensions, full specs and a gallery of images, visit Wacom.com.  (Seen via Photography Blog) Tweet Comment Previous Story Pocketable and performance-focused: The Sony RX100 V is here, see our first real-world shots!

Announcing its plans at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco yesterday, Microsoft said user interface will be available to run on mainstream PCs.  Lenovo already makes a 27inch tablet/PC hybrid, called to Yoga 900 HOW WILL IT WORK?  According to Microsoft, the Holographic shell UI for Windows 10 will enable users to put on a headset to navigate their Windows desktop. It will mix 2D apps such as email and calendars - which could be overlaid onto surfaces with augmented reality - with fully immersive 3D apps, such as a virtual reality tour of a location. The exact look and feel will be dependent on the headset used - where an Oculus Rift style VR headset being fully immersive, while a Holoens style headset enabling AR and mixed reality. Users will be able to select applications using a point and click selector, like a Wii controller.  The new Holographic shell desktop UI will enable users to run Windows 10 through a VR headset hooked up to a standard PC, opening up the experience beyond those with high end gaming machines.  Writing in a blog post, Microsoft's executive vice president for Windows, Terry Myerson, said: 'Next year, we will be releasing an update to Windows 10, which will enable mainstream PCs to run the Windows Holographic shell and associated mixed reality and universal Windows applications. 'The Windows Holographic shell enables an entirely new experience for multi-tasking in mixed reality, blending 2D and 3D apps at the same time, while supporting a broad range of 6 degrees of freedom devices.' Microsoft is working with chip-maker Intel on a specification for mixed reality PCs and head mounted displays, in an effort to open up the market and its platform. Microsoft has announced it will launch a new Holographic shell desktop UI for Windows 10, which will enable users to run Windows through a VR headset hooked up to a standard PC A video demonstrates how the interface will look running at 90 frames per second, triple that of most HD televisions. It shows a woman wearing a headset running a mix of 2D and 3D apps as she checks email, books flights, navigates a diary and takes a virtual tour (pictured) 'Our shared goal is to enable our hardware partners to build a broad range of devices for the mainstream consumer and business markets,' wrote Myerson. A promotional video demonstrates how the interface will look, running at 90 frames per second, triple that of most HD televisions. It shows a woman wearing a headset in a virtual room running a mix of 2D and 3D apps as she checks email, books flights, navigates a diary and takes a virtual tour of the Pantheon in Rome. The virtual dog in Windows holographic shell UI bears a close resemblance to Rover, the assistant character which made appearances in earlier Microsoft software Veteran Windows users will also notice the similarity between the virtual dog and Rover, an assistant character in Microsoft's less than successful Bob software and who later made an appearance in Windows XP. According to Microsoft, using a 'six degrees of freedom' headset, the interface can be manipulated using a point and click Wii-type controller. The headset in the video is unbranded (still pictured) but it could well be the Washington tech giant's mixed reality Hololens, or Facebook's Oculus Rift The headset in the video is unbranded but it could well be the Washington tech giant's mixed reality Hololens, or Facebook's Oculus Rift – which is set to launch in the UK next month – and which runs on Windows 10 devices.  While Hololens began shipping to developers in March at $3,000 a piece, but it remains unclear when a consumer version of the headsets could launch.

For example, connect it to the Productivity Module and you immediately get more battery time. The tablet itself has a built-in battery with a usage time of up to 10 hours and the Productivity Module increases the battery life by up to five more. Add the Presenter Module and it evolves into a pico projector with an HDMI port. The pico projector is really fun to use and allows you to present your work on a big screen or play HD movies on the tablet and display the pictures on a huge screen. The projector module is capable of showing a 60-inch display at a distance of two metres from the projector screen. The HDMI port has two switchable functions – HDMI-in and HDMI-out. You can use the HDMI-out function to play HD movies on the tablet while watching them on a large screen LED TV. Or you can use the X1 Tablet’s screen as a display for other devices such as a 4K video camera with HDMI output. Used as a tablet, the ThinkPad X1 is powerful. Several versions of the X1 Tablet are available and vary according to the CPU, memory and storage configurations. The one I tested was powered by the Intel Core m-5-6Y57 CPU running at 1.10 GHz and equipped with 8 gigabytes of DD3 RAM or working memory. It uses Samsung 512GB SSD as internal storage. And the tablet runs on Windows 10 Pro. The tablet comes with a large, bright and sharp display – a 12-inch IPS touch panel with 2160x1440-pixel resolutions in 3:2 ratio. The ThinkPad X1 is skinny too, boasting a footprint of just 291x209.5x8.4mm and a weight of 770 grammes. When used with a provided keyboard, which folds out as a front cover, the thickness increased by 5.2mm and 30g are added to the weight. The keyboard is really useful as it turns the tablet into a laptop computer. The full size ThinkPad keyboard with the iconic TrackPoint has three adjustable typing angles and recreates the classic ThinkPad keystroke feel. The keyboard can be easily snapped into place with a magnetic connection. The tablet has a built-in stand at its back so that you can position the computer in a position that’s comfortable for typing. Moreover, while the tablet is connected to the keyboard, you can simply fold it to the back of the tablet and the X1 will ask you whether to change its mode to a tablet mode so that the keyboard can stop functioning. The process reverses when you move the keyboard to the front. The X1 Tablet is suitable for an executive on the go thanks to a nano SIM slot that supports LTE 4G connection. This allows you to work on your projects on the move without having to look for Wi-Fi hotspots. The X1 Tablet is also business-ready because it comes with security features like Touch-Sensor fingerprint reader and remote manageability features like Intel vPro and Active Management Technology. The tablet has one full-size USB 3.0 port, a USB Type-C port for recharging its battery, a Mini Display Port, and headphone jack. Its nano SIM slot and microSD slot are located at the back behind the stand. The X1 Tablet uses the Intel 8260AC adapter to provide Wi-Fi 802.11 connection. I had no problem connecting it to my Linksys WRT1200AC router for fast Internet connection. During the test, I found that the X1 Tablet had good performance. Business applications ran fast and smoothly. Video clips also played smoothly. The tablet started up and shut down in a snap. I encountered no difficulties mounting the Productivity and Presenter Modules. The projected images looked sharp and clear on my wall during the test. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Tablet has a starting price of Bt60,000, depending on configurations. The expandable modules have to be pre-ordered and the prices will vary according to the number of ordered units.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sat, Oct 08, 2016 - Page 12　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Qualcomm reportedly sees progress on NXP agreement COUNTING ITS CHIPS:Two issues appear to be holding up a deal — a gap of less than 10 percent on the price and whether the deal would be all cash or cash and stock Bloomberg Qualcomm Inc is the only company in talks to acquire NXP Semiconductors NV and is making progress toward an agreement with the Dutch chipmaker on a fair price, people with knowledge of the matter said. There is currently a valuation gap of less than 10 percent between Qualcomm and NXP as they discuss a possible transaction, said two of the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Qualcomm is considering a deal structure of 75 percent cash and 25 percent stock, one of the people said. NXP would prefer all cash, another person said. Qualcomm, based in San Diego, California, is still considering its options and talks with NXP are in early stages, they said. NXP, based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, is pushing for a price of about US$120 per share, while Qualcomm is targeting a price closer to US$110 per share, the people said. The sides are closing that gap, signaling both parties are interested in reaching an agreement, the people said. NXP closed at US$102.50 a share on Wednesday in New York, giving it a market value of about US$35 billion. The company is working with Qatalyst Partners to find a buyer, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg last week. The list of chip companies that could afford to even think about buying NXP is short. Only seven members of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index are larger by market value. Of those, two are in completely different areas of the chip industry and another two, Intel Corp and Broadcom Ltd, are in the middle of digesting record purchases. Of the remainder, Qualcomm has by far has the most cash, with US$31 billion. Companies including Intel and Texas Instruments Inc looked and decided against pursuing NXP, the people said. Representatives for Qualcomm, NXP, Intel and Texas Instruments declined to comment. Qualcomm, with a market capitalization of about US$98 billion, is weighing a bid for NXP against about four other acquisition options, two of the people said. The company has been studying potential targets for at least six months, the people said, as it seeks to strengthen its position in a consolidating market and as shareholders want the largest maker of chips for mobile phones to put its cash to work. If Qualcomm and NXP are able to reach a deal, it would be the largest technology acquisition of the year. GADFLY’S ANALYSIS NXP’s preference for cash is understandable, especially given the recent performance of Qualcomm’s stock. Over the plast five years, shares of the US$100 billion company have seen only a quarter of the gains enjoyed by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index. Qualcomm’s stock has climbed about 6.5 percent since reports of its talks with NXP surfaced last week. It is rare to see an acquirer climb by that much, especially when a deal is so large and would involve a strategic shift (NXP is the largest maker of chips for cars, whereas Qualcomm focuses on smartphones). However, this transaction is just so accretive. Qualcomm is also sitting on about US$31 billion in cash and equivalents, a large part of which is trapped overseas. NXP’s Netherlands home base would allow it to put that money to work. At US$115 a share, a 40 percent premium to NXP’s unaffected price, a deal would easily add to Qualcomm’s earnings even before synergies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

AMD and NVIDIA both had their driver teams working up until the very last minute to ensure they got as many performance tweaks and bug fixes into their day-1 drivers.  Gears of War 4 is an interesting game title in the sense that it must be run on Windows 10 Anniversary Edition and uses the DirectX 12 API with features like async compute and tiled resources. Gears of War 4 has check minimum, recommended and ideal system specifiactions published for both AMD and Intel/NVIDIA systems and they’re all pretty beastly. According to the ‘ideal’ system specifications you’ll want to be running an AMD FX-9590 or an Intel Core i7-4790 processor and either an AMD Radeon R9 Fury X or a NVIDIA Geforce 980 Ti / Geforce GTX 1080 graphics card. The recommended specifications aren’t much easier on graphics card as it is suggested you run an AMD Radeon R9 290X / Radeon RX 480 or an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 / GeForce GTX 1060. Those are all fairly new higher-end cards. If you have a video card older or slower than the Raddeon R7 260X They really aren’t kidding about needing 80GB of free space as we installed the game by itself on a secondary SSD and found that it used up 73.9GB of space! Microsoft and the developer (The Coalition) have worked hard to make the PC port not suck and have placed over 30 graphics cards settings in the option menu with over 100-plus options that you can adjust. NVIDIA already has a great Gears of War 4 graphics and performance guide that they wrote up and posted online that dives deep into many of those settings. The performance guide they wrote up is over 7,000 words and has interactive comparisons of different settings, the impact that many have on performance and then general performance on ten different NVIDIA graphics cards. Since NVIDIA has spent days if not weeks preparing and testing all that we’ll skip over that and just focus on doing independent performance testing on AMD and NVIDIA graphics cards to show you the real numbers that we manually ran on our test system. Gears of War 4 comes with a built-in benchmark that appears to be pretty decent and shows the average minimum framerate (bottom 5%) in the results. This is the benchmark that we ran on nine different graphics cards with Ultra image quality settings to see how they would perform. Before we look at the numbers, let’s take a brief look at the test system that was used. Questions or Comments? View this thread in our forums!

John Mellinger This game runs amazing on my 970. No need for SLI unless I get a new monitor https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKhwZXDwXbM Vaughn Plata That is always the story with Dual card setups you either have to wait for NV or AMD to create a provide or the game vendor to support it should not be a surprise to anyone. Jason Kane “The Coalition plans to incorporate multi-GPU support in a game update that will be happening in the near future.” Well in that case that’s when they’ll get my money and not before…not wasting my 970SLI.

SCOUT Chad Simmons Sooner Intel: LB a spot to watch (again) Bob Przybylo 10/07/2016 Intel returns with a look at what Tay Evans' news means for OU linebackers going forward. It’s just the nature of the beast. There isn’t one person who isn’t disappointed for Tay Evans. The former Oklahoma linebacker’s career is over because of lingering issues with concussions. Nobody is throwing a party about it and everybody hopes he can keep his head high. And if he so chooses, becomes a student-coach for the Sooners. Then reality sets in. With Evans, who only would have been a redshirt junior in 2017, out of the picture, the Sooners have to find another answer at inside linebacker. Who’s it going to be? Of course OU is set with one major land at the spot. You can get greedy when you know you have Collinsville (Okla.) High’s Levi Draper wrapped up. The security of a Scout 100 prospect means you can play things out and try to find the right fit. And truthfully, OU has a couple of those guys already. It’s not like Mike Stoops and Tim Kish are going to have to go back to the drawing board, but it does feel like maybe they can take all the inside prospects they see worthy. http://www.scout.com/player/194194-jacob-phillips?s=73 Let’s start with the popular pick in Nashville (Tenn.) East Literature’s Jacob Phillips. The Scout 300 prospect has seemed like OU or Alabama for several months now. The Crimson Tide did everything right on his visit, but when you get a five-star like Dylan Moses on the same weekend, you start to wonder if it’s not in the cards for Phillips and Bama. Phillips is going to take his final official visit this weekend to College Station to see Texas A&M and Tennessee. Going into the visit, it feels like the ultimate courtesy visit and a chance to see a huge game in a great atmosphere. Notre Dame doesn’t seem to be a factor. Oregon was never a grave concern. It’s still down to OU and Bama, but the Sooners seem to have a lot more to offer Phillips right now based on early playing time. http://www.scout.com/player/204330-tyler-taylor?s=73 The other name to circle is Buford (Ga.) Lanier’s Tyler Taylor. Ranked as a Scout 300 outside linebacker, you look at his size and see a potential move to the inside if he were to be a Sooner. And he absolutely could move and could absolutely be a Sooner. Taylor has made two visits to Norman already and come away incredibly impressed on both of them. Not only that, his family has given the trips rave reviews as well. Now Taylor wants to play things out a lot more, which looked like it could spell the end of any hope of him being in Norman. But with Evans off the table, OU can wait for Taylor and hope Taylor is still all about the Sooners when his choice rolls around. Taylor said he wants to make another visit to Norman, which would have to be an unofficial one this time around. For a non-regional recruit to make three visits would be one heck of a great sign. http://www.scout.com/player/193606-kenneth-murray?s=73 You could also get a little funky with who you already have locked up. In this case, we’re talking about Missouri City (Texas) Fort Bend Elkins linebacker Kenneth Murray. Ranked as an outside linebacker, Murray has the size to move inside, and he has been sensational so far during his senior season. If Murray were to move, then you’ve got the possibility of guys like K’Jakyre Daley and K’Lavon Chaisson as legitimate outside linebacker targets. http://www.scout.com/player/179859-anthony-hines?s=73 The one name do not want to give OU fans any false hope with is Plano (Texas) East inside linebacker Anthony Hines. The five-star prospect and the Sooners appeared to have gone their separate ways and everybody might be better off in thinking about who wants to be at OU instead of guys who you think should be at OU. Doubt we’ll ever really hear the story of how things broke down between OU and Hines, but there’s a clear riff and doesn’t look like it will be corrected anytime soon.     Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout Sooners leadership shows in 45-24 win vs. BU Przybylo: OU bred for 'Championship November' Post-chaos CFP rankings out: Who's 2, 3 & 4?

SCOUT Sooner Intel: OU focused on certain few Bob Przybylo 10/07/2016 Intel returns with a look at why it's OK that OU isn't bringing the house for Red River Showdown. Not going to stop you from saying the Oklahoma-Texas matchup is lacking the sizzle of years past. Both teams have two losses and a lot of recruits are headed to College Station for Texas A&M and Tennessee. What will say, though, is no big deal. The Sooners enter the weekend with 20 commits for the 2017 class, including 15 in the Scout 300. That’s not much more OU needs to do at this point to finish the class outside of finding the last pieces and keeping the committed ones home. So yea, the visitors list isn’t all that exciting. Don’t panic. There are two names for OU to zero in on and a chance to make that major impression. http://www.scout.com/player/204366-kobe-boyce?s=73 Lake Dallas (Texas) High CB Kobe Boyce A lot of OU fans believe wide receiver commit Jalen Reagor is looking for a reason to leave SoonerSquad17. If that’s the case, then say hello to the Texas version of it. Boyce has been committed to the Horns for a while, but it has always felt like he’s had one foot out the door. That feeling continued last month when Boyce, a high three-star cornerback, made an official visit to Norman to see the Sooners and Buckeyes. It felt like it would just be a matter of when and not if Boyce would decommit. Three weeks later and still waiting so this would be OU’s chance to show Boyce the problems in the secondary are gone, and now you can come home to Norman. Boyce seems to be favoring OU right now and has no doubt developed a good bond with OU’s 2017 commits. A win here might be enough to push him over the edge and make that leap. http://www.scout.com/player/202196-k-lavon-chaisson?s=73 Galena Park (Texas) North Shore DE K’Lavon Chaisson Oh what a recruitment this has been. From looking like an OU lock in the summer to parting ways to reconnecting once again. OU is being helped immensely by the struggles of LSU and Florida State as those two schools would seemingly be the top ones for Chaisson in a different scenario. Instead, if OU can win for the second week in a row and defeat its rival, it could show Chaisson the 2016 season is not lost. Texas is also in the mix for Chaisson, but it’s so hard to see anybody heading toward Charlie Strong based on his uncertain future. OU can do a lot of good in helping its cause with Chaisson, while at the same time hurting the chances for Texas to land the Scout 100 prospect. Those are the names. Now OU is bringing the house in terms of its commitments, no doubt about that. Included in that will be the newest pledge, Mansfield running back Kennedy Brooks. There will be some 2018 recruits to watch, but OU had to fight off Arkansas-Alabama for recruits in Tulsa and the Aggies-Vols for kids in Texas. It wasn’t ideal so the key thing to watch is how well the group interacts together. A good number of these recruits were together in Norman three weeks ago when Ohio State put on a pounding on the Sooners at Owen Field. It’s a chance to make things right. Get the commits smiling again and start adding more members to the fold for SoonerSquad17.   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout OU 11: Baylor Przybylo: OU bred for 'Championship November' Charles Walker NOT returning to OU Sooners No. 9 in CFP rankings Scout 2017 Rankings Directory Sooners Illustrated Top Stories OU's road to CFP playoff a daunting one OU's road to the college football playoff is not a smooth road but not impossible. by Bob Przybylo Sooners Illustrated7:15 PM Sooners No. 9 in CFP rankingsOU is in the top 10 of the college football playoff rankings for the first time, coming in at No. 9. by Bob Przybylo Sooners Illustrated6:38 PM Breaking News Charles Walker NOT returning to OUDefensive lineman Charles Walker is not going to return to OU and will focus on the NFL Draft. by Bob Przybylo Sooners Illustrated4:57 PM OU 11: BaylorPretty easy No. 1 choice this week for the OU 11. by Bob Przybylo Sooners Illustrated7:20 AM Przybylo: OU bred for 'Championship November'OU keeps slowly rising up the rankings because Sooners know what 'Championship November' is all about. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedYesterday at 7:19 AM Life After Buddy - Sooners tipoff previewOU basketball is here.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 7, 2016 at 8:43AM An Intel desktop chip. Image source: Intel.  Last year, former Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Client Computing Group chief Kirk Skaugen admitted to something of an epic blunder. In a bid to save a little bit on research and development expenses (yes, really), the company straight up didn't bother building a new generation of desktop processors to support the business (which Skaugen said was worth around $10 billion at the time) between mid-2014 and mid-2015. This mistake, Skaugen indicated at the time, had a negative impact on the company's financial performance (without new products, it was likely more difficult for personal computer makers to convince potential customers to buy new systems). Unsurprisingly, Skaugen said that Intel is now committed to refreshing its desktop product line annually. Although there's every indication that Intel is trying to put out new desktop processors each year, the reality appears to be that execution problems are keeping Intel from hitting a strict annual release cadence. Past, present, and future Here are Intel's desktop processor architectures along with their respective launch dates: Architecture Release Date Time From Predecessor Sandy Bridge January 2011 1 year, 3 months Ivy Bridge April 2012 1 year, 3 months Haswell June 2013 1 year, 2 months Skylake  August 2015 2 years, 2 months Kaby Lake January 2017 (expected) 1 year, 5 months Coffee Lake  Q2 2018 (expected) >=1 year, 3 months Data sources: Various. The typical generation-on-generation cadence appears to be on the order of one year and three months. There is an exception when we look at the Haswell to Skylake transition, but this can be thought of as a two-generation jump (since Intel didn't release chips based on its Broadwell architecture for this segment). Interestingly enough, Intel hasn't been able to actually achieve a strict annual product release cadence, at least in desktops, over the last five years. And, based on what we know about Intel's future processor releases, it's not going to be able to hit such a cadence over the next couple of generations. Delays are hurting Intel's progress Early leaks suggested that Intel was initially targeting a fourth-quarter 2016 launch for the desktop variants of Kaby Lake. However, that schedule slipped to a January 2017 launch. Additionally, Digitimes reported that Intel had originally planned to release Coffee Lake for desktops during the second half of 2017, though other leaks now point to a launch of these products in the second quarter of 2018. A single product delay isn't enough to throw a company off track. The problem that Intel faces is that with each generation, the schedule seems to slip by about three months (remember: Intel should ideally aim to launch new products every 12 months). Those three-month slips add up -- indeed, by the time Intel launches Coffee Lake, those slips will have added up to at least 18 months, or nearly two product cycles. Can Intel fix it? 18 months is a long time, but I believe that Intel can cut significantly into that deficit over the next several years with excellent execution and a willingness to shorten some product cycles. For example, if Intel is willing to replace Coffee Lake with its successor, known as Ice Lake, in the fourth quarter of 2018, then that could shave off roughly six months. Then, if Intel were able to release Tiger Lake (the successor to Ice Lake) in the third quarter of 2019, that would be good for another three months out of that deficit. At that point, the previously 18-month deficit would be cut down to just a nine-month one. From that point forward, Intel probably wouldn't need to work to further reduce it -- just keep it from growing any further. The one little problem Although I do think that Intel could, in theory, accelerate its product development and launches to recover lost time, we have to keep in mind that the same teams that allowed Intel to fall behind in the first place (both Intel's manufacturing and product development groups deserve some blame) are the ones running the show now. Intel appears to have taken some actions to try to improve its execution by bringing on accomplished executives such as Murthy Renduchintala to try to fix the company's "competitiveness gaps." Perhaps things will get better out in time, but at least over the next couple of product cycles, things don't seem to be on track to get much better. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Some ship with Windows software. Some have Linux. And others have no operating system at all. Want to install your own operating system? If you’re using Windows that shouldn’t be too hard. But Linux may be another story, since many GNU/Linux-based operating systems lack some of the wireless or HDMI/audio features you may need. But developer Linuxium (Ian Morrison) has been releasing patched builds of Ubuntu Linux for tiny, Atom-powered computers like the Intel Compute Stick for a while. Now he has gathered a bunch of his builds in one place, making it easy to install Ubuntu on most desktop computers with Intel Bay Trail or Cherry Trail processors. In addition to Ubuntu, there are downloads available for Lubuntu, Xubuntu, Kubuntu, Ubuntu GNOME, and Ubuntu MATE (which all share a common core, but which have different desktop environments).

The laptop’s only 18.95mm thick and weighs 3.5 pounds. I wish I could help you visualize that width. A Macbook Air is approximately 17mm thick. Does that help? The UX410 also has a slim 6mm bezel and comes with a 14-inch Full HD display. There are two versions of the laptop — the UX410UA and the UX410UQ. They only differ in their graphics cards. The UX410Q comes with Nvidia’s GeForce 940MX graphics card, whereas the UX410UA comes with integrated Intel graphics. You can see a full spec list for the UX410UA here and the UX410UQ here. Razer, Lenovo, and Acer already have laptops out with Intel’s new processor, but Asus’s UX410 likely competes most directly with the Dell XPS 13. Dell doesn’t offer a Nvidia graphics card option, however. We don’t have pricing for the UX410 just yet, though, so we can’t say whether it’s wildly more expensive than its competition.

Home Consulting Advertise Contact & About Archive Price Lists (deprecated) Is 3D XPoint in trouble? by Robin Harris on Thursday, 6 October, 2016 The Register’s Chris Mellor and SemiAccurate’s Charlie Demerjian are throwing shade on Intel’s claims for 3D XPoint. While it’s great fun to tweak the giants of tech – as I often do – I think they are likely wrong in their interpretation of the data backing their arguments. As Mr. Mellor wrote: In contrast to the wildly optimistic Intel “1,000 times faster than NAND” claims when XPoint was launched, the Micron pitch presented a 10-times improvement over NAND in terms of IOPS and latency, and four times more memory footprint than DRAM per CPU. Mr. Demerjian goes further in his comments: Latency missed by 100x, yes one hundred times, on their claim of 1000x faster, 10x is now promised and backed up by tests. More troubling is endurance, probably the main selling point of this technology over NAND. Again the claim was a 1000x improvement, Intel delivered 1/333rd of that with 3x the endurance. Chips vs systems Intel and Micron are chip folks. I’m confident that at the chip/media level, the results that Intel reported are close – despite marketing rounding-up – but when talking about SSDs, Optane or QuantX, the subject is a system, not media. A system with a CPU, lots of software, buffers, caches, bandwidth and, finally, media. Example Back when RAID arrays were a radical new technology in the early 90s, the simple fact that you could gang together a half dozen disks and get a 5x performance improvement was a big deal. A little later caching came on the scene, and made RAID even more compelling. But did adding in a layer of RAM – which was, let’s say, a million times faster – make RAID arrays a million faster? Of course not. The difference between write-back and write-through caching – and the associated engineering/test problems – played a major role as well. Nor did replacing hard drives with SSDs make arrays as fast as raw NAND read numbers would suggest. Systems consist of cooperating parts, and making one part a thousand times faster doesn’t make all the other parts go faster too. Mr. Mellor, of course, understands this, remarking: We might say that the original XPoint claims referred to raw media comparisons and not system-level performance, a point not made clear in the original XPoint performance, density and endurance claims. The StorageMojo take Intel is not a marketing company. They are an engineering company selling to engineers and, as such, they often put a foot wrong when trying to reach the general tech public. But that doesn’t explain why Intel/Micron rushed the 3D XPoint announcement: freeze out competitors; help Micron fight an acquisition; and/or panic at some perceived threat, such as Nantero? They might have consulted with their CPU colleagues on the problems that come from hyping, say, clock speeds, in the NetBurst days. Whatever drove the announcement, they did themselves no favors by focusing on cell-level performance. But unlike those who read the announcement as a promise to deliver systems with those performance improvements, I’m pleased that they got into the market with 3D XPoint, because they are driving the industry faster than any startup could. And that’s good for the industry and for computer systems buyers and users everywhere. The problems that I can see, such as schedule slips, appear normal for advanced technology. Courteous comments welcome, of course.

This will mark the second consecutive year of decline. The global devices market fell by 0.75 percent in 2015. “The global devices market is not on pace to return to single-digit growth soon,” said Ranjit Atwal, research director at Gartner, in a statement. Growth is on pace to remain flat during the next five years. All segments are expected to decline in 2016, except for premium ultramobiles and utility mobile phones (entry level phones), which are expected to show single-digit growth this year. “We expect premium ultramobiles will start benefiting from the collective performance and integration of the latest Intel CPU platform and Windows 10,” added Mr. Atwal. Table 1. Worldwide Devices Shipments by Device Type, 2015-2018 (Millions of Units) The Ultramobile (Premium) category includes devices such as Microsoft’s Windows 10 Intel x86 products and Apple’s MacBook Air. The Ultramobile (Basic and Utility Tablets) category includes devices such as, iPad, iPad mini, Samsung Galaxy Tab S2, Amazon Fire HD, Lenovo Yoga Tab 3, Acer Iconia One PC Market to Bottom Out in 2016 and PC Prices in the UK to Increase Less Than 10 Percent in 2017 The PC market is expected to exhibit an 8 per cent decline in 2016, as the installed base bottoms out and replacement cycle extensions halt. “The effect of currency depreciation on the market is diminishing,” added Mr. Atwal. “The second quarter of 2016 was the first since the second quarter of 2015 least impacted by currency depreciation.” Regions such as Western Europe, where the Euro depreciated significantly in 2015 and PC prices increased, finally showed flat market growth (-0.9 percent) in the second quarter of 2016. This follows four consecutive quarters of decline. If this situation prevails it means that PC sales will bottom out in 2016. However, the PC market in Western Europe remains difficult following the Brexit vote. “Device vendors are mitigating the currency depreciation of the pound in two ways — first, they are taking advantage of the likelihood of a single-digit decline in PC component costs in 2016,” said Mr. Atwal. “Second, they will “de-feature” their PCs to keep prices down. With these changes, Gartner expects PC prices in the UK to increase by less than 10 percent in 2017.” For the PC market to stay on pace for flat growth in 2017, business spending needs to flourish. “The inventory of Windows 8 PCs should have been cleared, and large businesses in mature markets are now looking to move to Windows 10 through 2018,” added Mr. Atwal. “In addition, more affordable hardware and increasingly available virtual reality content (such as games, stories and other entertainment) will enable consumer PC buyers to upgrade in order to experience immersive offerings. Smartphone Growth to Continue Slowing Down in 2016 Total mobile phone shipments are on pace to decline 1.6 percent in 2016. The smartphone segment continues to grow, albeit more slowly than in previous years, and is expected to reach 1.5 billion units in 2016. “This is no surprise; the smartphone market is maturing, and reaching global saturation with phones that are increasingly capable and remain good enough for longer,” said Roberta Cozza, research director at Gartner, in a statement. In 2016, the Android market will continue to be bolstered by Chinese vendors offering more affordable premium devices. Despite the availability of the iPhone 7, Gartner expects a weaker year-over-year volume performance from Apple in 2016, as volumes stabilize after a very strong 2015. As a result, Gartner expects total smartphone market to only increase 4.5 percent with premium smartphones declining 1.1 percent in 2016. “We expect the market for premium smartphones to return to 3.5 per cent growth in 2017, as stronger replacement cycles kick in and in anticipation of a new iPhone next year, which is expected to offer a new design and new features that are attractive enough to convince more replacement buyers,” said Ms. Cozza.

MacDailyNews Take: Death to the “S!” Note that the only thing “different” to the non tech-savvy general public about iPhone 7 versus the iPhone 6s is the naming scheme. The down year was the self-defeatingly-named “S” model. The whole number iPhone model is expected to show growth despite looking pretty much the same. There are plenty of numbers in the universe. Infinite, actually. Don’t worry, Apple, you won’t run out. – MacDailyNews, October 4, 2011 — It’s as if Apple is naming iPhone models solely for their own internal inventory purposes, just so they can keep track of which model is which, with no regard for how the iPhones are perceived by the rest of the world – the media, the customers, etc. – outside One Infinite Loop. The “S” doesn’t stand for “Speed,” it stands for “Stupid.” Yes, we know it’s the same case design; we know the “S” version is the one you make the big margins on; we get it. Call it the “S” internally if you must, but don’t be so engineer-ish that you insist on calling it that on the box, too! It’s not about sales figures or the model’s success (as long as “iPhone” is in the name, it will be a success), it’s about setting a tone. In this case, with the “S,” Apple sets a tone that they are just making an incremental update… Why gift the naysayers with the opportunity, Apple? — MacDailyNews Take, April 5, 2013 — Apple, enough with the stupid iPhone ‘S’ naming already. iPhone “S” years usher in hugely significant features, such as oleophobic displays, significant GPU improvements, world phone capability, Siri personal assistant, video stabilization, panorama photos, 64-bit processors, TD-LTE support, Touch ID, and 3D Touch, among other improvements and additions. Each year’s iPhone deserves its own number. By not doing so, Apple is shooting itself in the foot; handicapping iPhones with an “S” every other year. Why Tim Cook or Phil Schiller haven’t put an end to this stupid – yes, stupid – “S” naming is inexplicable. Why don’t you just name it “iPhone No Big Deal This Year,” Tim and Phil? Here’s what you say onstage and in the press release when there’s no “iPhone 7s” and you jump directly from iPhone 7 to iPhone 8: “The improvements are such that the new iPhone deserves its own number.” Period. Done. Mission accomplished. It’s your naming convention, Apple, and you can correct your stupid mistake at any time. – MacDailyNews, September 16, 2015 Categories: News Tags: death to the 'S', gartner, iPad, iPad Pro, iPhone 6s, iPhone 7, MacBook, MacBook Air, smartphones Thank You for supporting MacDailyNews!

The smaller your transistors, the more you can fit on a chip, and the faster and more efficient your processor can be. That's why it's such big news that a team at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has successfully built a functional 1 nanometer long transistor gate, which the lab claims is smallest working transistor ever made. For years, the computing industry has been governed by Moore’s Law, which states that the the number of transistors in a semiconductor circuit doubles every two years. Current generation technology uses 14nm scale technology, with 10nm semiconductors anticipated for release in 2017 or 2018 with products like Intel’s Cannonlake line. looking to the future, Moore’s law starts to run into trouble But looking to the future, Moore’s law starts to run into trouble. And by trouble, I mean the laws of physics. You see, while the 7nm node is technically possible to produce with silicon, after that point you reach problems, where silicon transistors smaller than 7nm become so physically close together that electrons experience quantum tunneling. So instead of staying in the intended logic gate, the electrons can continuously flow from one gate to the next, essentially making it impossible for the transistors to have an off state. Sujay Desai/UC Berkeley And while companies like Intel had originally announced that they would be exploring other materials for producing 7nm semiconductors and beyond, the Berkeley Lab research team has beaten them to the punch, using carbon nanotubes and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2 ) to create a sub–7nm transistor. The MoS2 functions as the semiconductor, with the hollow carbon nanotube functioning as the gate to control the flow of electrons. The research here is still in very early stages That said, the research here is still in very early stages. At 14nm, a single die has over a billion transistors on it, and the Berkley Lab team has yet to develop a viable method to mass produce the new 1nm transistors or even developed a chip using them. But as a proof of concept alone, the results here are still important – that new materials can continue to allow smaller transistor sizes, and with it increased power and efficiency for the computers of the future.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Asus preps 87 motherboards for next-gen Intel CPUs by Wayne Manion  12:41 PM on October 6, 2016 Kaby Lake isn't coming to desktop systems until sometime next year, but Asus has already released UEFI BIOS updates for 87 of its LGA 1151 consumer desktop motherboards in anticipation of Intel's "optimized" 14-nm CPU line. More of the company's motherboards are likely to receive firmware updates in the future to that end, as well. Asus' Edge Up in-house blog conspicuously avoids using the terms "seventh-generation Core" or "Kaby Lake," but the blog post leaves little doubt that the BIOS updates are in fact intended for the Intel's seventh-generation Core CPUs likely to appear on store shelves in Q1 2017. Asus reminds users that some of its motherboards' firmware can be updated without a CPU or memory by using the integrated USB BIOS Flashback feature. Boards without that feature can be updated through the EFI using its EZ Flash 3 utility. Asus provides Windows UEFI updating software, as well. The full list of motherboards with updated firmware can be viewed in the blog post here.

Now without changing the hardware, Oculus has used a new software API called "asynchronous spacewarp" to officially lower that recommended spec. Today, Oculus says the Rift will run acceptably on any machine with an Nvidia 960 or greater and an intel i3-6100 (or AMD FX4350) or greater. The key to that change, Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe says, is a new "asychronous spacewarp" technology built into the Oculus API. Much like the Oculus' existing "asyncrhonous timewarp" technology (which Iribe says eliminates almost all of the 11 percent of frames that would otherwise be dropped in VR), Iribe says "spacewarp" allows games to run at an internal 45 frames per second while still providing a smooth 90 frames per second to the headset. The spacewarp system (which is built into the Oculus runtime) takes the two previous frames generated by software, analyzes the difference, and calculates a spatial transformation that can generate a "synthetic frame" based on the current head translation and movement. While Iribe was clear that this synthetic frame system is still "no replacement for native 90 hz rendering," it does fill in the frame rate gaps on systems that are not able to hit that framerate natively. Hence, the Oculus Rift officially supports PC hardware that's less powerful than it did before. That includes a new $499 Oculus Ready PC from CyberPowerPC and AMD. Oculus is also certifying four Oculus-ready laptops from the likes of ASUS, Alienware, Lenovo, Aorus. Iribe promised that, within a few years, there will be hundreds of laptops that meet that Oculus Ready spec. For now, though, Iribe said "PC VR is more affordable than ever.

In simple terms, virtualization is a simulated platform or environment on top of a host node, which is quite abstract for an user. These simulated virtual environment can be an operating systems, or some development environment, etc. This gives us the ability to efficiently use the hardware resources of the host node. What is KVM? KVM stands for Kernel Based Virtualization. Kernel based virtualization was implemented to get the advantage of hardware assisted virtualization support given by the new generation of Intel and AMD CPU’s. During initial stages of development of virtualization technology the CPUs where fully emulated by the software which eventually lacked in performance because of absence of direct hardware access. These days, the CPUs in market supports the virtualization which is the result of the change in their architecture from the earlier stages. This is also called hardware assisted virtualization. If you are totally new to virtualization, this is a good place to start, where we’ve explained the three areas of Virtualization, and two types of hypervisors: Introduction to Server Virtualization Technology and Hypervisor Types The following are various approaches that were followed during the early development stage of the virutalization technology. Running the virtual machine on the host systems processor instead of emulating a processor using binary translation technique. It works without modifying the guest operating system. Modifying the guest systems operating system to communicate with a Hypervisor which has direct access to the hardware. Xen hypervisor platform is an example of it which implements Para virtualization. Modifying the host systems processor so that it could be easy to communicate with hypervisor and thus supporting the virtualization. It removes the need of the binary translation and emulation. It leads to full virtualization rather than para-virtualization. Modifying the host systems operating system so that it could support the virtualization. It results in native hypervisors rather than hosted ones. The kernel based Virtualization leverages the advantages of 3rd and 4th approach mentioned above. What is a Hypervisor? A Hypervisor is nothing but a middle layer of program, between the guest operating system and host systems hardware. It manages the actual hardware for all the connecting guest operating systems. The hypervisors can be of two types: native or hosted. The hypervisors are also called as VMMs-[Virtual Machine managers]. Please refer the figure below. It represents a bare-metal native hypervisor. Good examples of hosted hypervisors can be VMware or virtual box software. If you are new to VMWare, this will help: VMware Virtualization Fundamentals – VMware Server and VMware ESXi If you are new to Virtualbox, this is a good place to start: How to Install Oracle VM VirtualBox and Create a Virtual Machine KVM Evolution So, as a modern solution for the effective virtualization, kernel based virtual machine (KVM) evolved. It essentially uses the CPU extensions provided by modern hardware virtualization supporting CPUs, by a module with the kernel of host operating system. By use of this kernel based virtualization module, the kernel of the host operating systems works as a hypervisor leveraging the features of Linux kernel and the hardware supporting the virtualization. So to compare KVM with XEN and QEMU, we can say, KVM uses the processor extension for virtualization whereas QEMU works with complete emulation of the CPU on the other hand XEN works as an external hypervisor to the host operating system instead of using kernel for it. Using KVM we can run multiple virtual machines with any operating system, on a single machine or say the host system. KVM is introduced in Linux Kernel since 2.6.20 stable release. Good Example of KVM is the virtualization solution coming with RPM based Red Hat and Fedora distributions. Linux KVM Benefits If you are new to Linux KVM, this will help you to get started: How to Install Linux KVM and Create Guest VM with Examples The following are some of the features and benefits of Kernel based virtualization. With help of KVM module, it manages the performance critical parts of interrupts and timers by kernel based I/O emulation. It gives a capability to set limit on I/O request between virtual machine and host. The KVM module allows here emulation for CPU modes not supported by physical processor and the instructions. KVM module used is a part of the upstream Linux kernel as it’s added to it for enhancing virtualization. KVM module used here provides common interface for both Intel and AMD x86 processors which supports hardware virtualization. For Intel it is known as Intel VMX hardware assist for virtualization and for AMD it is known as AMD SVM hardware assist for virtualization. It creates a bare-metal hypervisor out of the kernel. We can say it creates a native hypervisor. Leverages the capability of MMU (Memory management unit) in hardware to virtualize the memory with improvement in performance. A virtual machine created by it is a standard Linux process, scheduled by its native standard Linux scheduler. It supports Intel’s EPT (Extended Page Table) and AMD’s RVI (Rapid virtualization indexing) features for memory virtualization by CPU vendors. Its supports all the file system supported by mainstream Linux kernel. Improved utilization of resources and access to it by providing flexible storage. It’s very easy to add memory, vCPU, Hard Disk to Linux KVM. Supports wide range of guest operating system including windows, UNIX, Solaris and DOS. All the features of the Linux like implementation of security using SELinux, wide range of hardware support and supporting Device drivers are inherited to kernel based virtual machines. Secure remote management by the API provided by the virtualization modules. Enhanced scalability as main stream of Linux kernel can be extended by adding modules to leverage more features.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Falcon Northwest laptops join the Pascal party by Eric Born  9:00 AM on October 6, 2016 Laptop manufacturers around the world have eagerly refreshed their lineups to include Nvidia's Pascal GPUs. Lured by the promise of desktop-class performance in a notebook,  Asus, Gigabyte, and Aorus all announced Pascal-powered laptops on the same day. Now, boutique builder Falcon Northwest has updated its DRX and TLX notebooks with Nvidia's latest GPUs. Falcon Northwest thinks its DRX notebook can replace users' desktops without sacrificing performance. The result is an 8.6 lb (3.9 kg) monster that's 1.6" tall (4.1 cm). Its 17.3" IPS display sports Nvidia's G-sync technology, and has a maximum resolution of 1920x1080. There's room for a full-size keyboard with a numpad, as well as a two-button trackpad with an integrated fingerprint reader. DRX notebooks also have two Mini DisplayPort outputs, a USB 3.1 Type-C port, and a Thunderbolt port.  As you'd expect from a boutique shop, DRX laptops are highly customizable, and they all employ the same Intel Skylake processors as found in Falcon Northwest's desktops. Purchasers can select among Intel Core i5-6500, Core i5-6600K, or Core i7-6700K CPUs. For graphics horsepower, Falcon Northwest offers Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1060, 1070, or 1080 graphics cards. From there, buyers can add up to 64GB of DDR4 memory and up to four storage devices. Unsurprisingly, this hardware needs a lot of power. Falcon Northwest says gamers can expect about two hours of runtime before the battery will need to be swapped out or recharged. Users who expect a little more mobility from their mobile devices might consider Falcon Northwest's TLX notebook. At 5.8 lbs (2.6 kg) and 1.2" thick (3 cm), the TLXs are considerably more trim than the DRX models. Falcon Northwest opted for a 15.6" 1920x1080 display here—and yes, it's equipped with G-Sync. Like the DRX, TLX laptops have a full keyboard and numpad. There's no ThunderBolt port on these machines, though. TLX notebooks are a bit less customizable than the DRX models. Interested buyers can pick Intel's Core i7-6700HQ or Core i7-6820HK CPUs. All TLX models are equipped with Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1070. Despite the smaller size, these machines can still pack up to 64GB of DDR4 memory and up to four storage devices. The battery is non-removable, and should be good for about two hours of runtime. However users configure DRX or TLX notebooks, Falcon Northwest will throw in a backpack carrying case and a custom paint job on the lid for no extra charge. TLX notebooks start at $2200, while the larger DRX notebooks start at $2600. Both are available right now.

Replacing older servers with newer, more energy efficient ones can reduce OPEX costs significantly. For more information on Server Hardware Why Lenovo for Hyperconverged? Partner Offers Choosing the right combination of servers is the trick, and the choice depends greatly on the kinds of workloads you need to support. Two new systems from Dell and HPE provide contrasting options to address your specific needs. Today's big data workloads beg for lots of CPU cores and memory. Both Dell and HPE deliver on that requirement with the Dell PowerEdge R930 and HPE ProLiant DL580. Our test systems came equipped with four Intel Xeon E7-8890 v3 processors plus 512 GB of memory, although both systems can handle up to 6TB if you max out the 96 DIMM slots. Beyond those details are some very different capabilities in the two systems, which we'll discuss in more detail shortly. Hardware Choices Local storage is the name of the game with the Dell PowerEdge R930. One quick look at the front panel reveals twenty-four small form factor (SFF) drive slots. If you look closer, you'll see a total of eight dedicated NVMe slots split across two PCIe interfaces. That leaves sixteen slots for 12Gb SAS HDD or SAS/SATA SSD drives to serve as a capacity tier. Dell offers 3.2 TB NVMe drives, so you could outfit this system with 25.6 TB of super-fast flash storage. Couple that with 3.84 TB SAS or SATA SSDs, and you've got 61.44 TB of read intensive flash. Putting that kind of storage along with sixty CPU cores gives you a monster system in a box. While the HPE ProLiant DL580 sports the same CPU and memory options as the Dell PowerEdge R930, it has more of a focus on modern GPU intensive workloads. Our test system came with a total of eight full-length 16X PCIe slots and a beefy power supply to support double-wide GPU boards. We test installed an Nvidia Tesla GPU card to get a feel for what this system can do. Local storage does not play as prominent of a role with a total of ten available SFF slots. The HPE ProLiant DL580 does support NVMe drives should you have a need for fast local storage. Both Dell and HPE offer a variety of networking options via both on-board and add-in cards. The Dell PowerEdge R930 came with an Intel X540 10GB Ethernet card that supports both 1 and 10 GbE connections. Dell also offers a number of networking options, including the Mellanox ConnectX-4 dual-port 25 GbE adapter. The HPE ProLiant DL580 came with an on-board dual 10 GbE FlexFabric network adapter plus a 4-port 1 GbE adapter. HPE also offers 25 GbE networking with their 640SFP28 dual-port adapter. On the power front you have a number of options with both systems. Both the Dell PowerEdge R930 and the HPE ProLiant DL580 come with four power supply slots. Dell offers a choice of either a 750W or a 1100W individual power supply. You must choose the configuration you'll need from a matrix of non-redundant, redundant and failover options. A minimum of two power supplies must be installed for redundant operations and three for failover. The HPE ProLiant DL580 utilizes higher-wattage power supplies in order to support the power-hungry GPU boards. Options here include 1200W and 1500W models with similar redundancy and failover requirements. Management Both Dell's iDRAC and HPE's iLO provide out-of-band management capabilities for connecting directly to the server. Each management platform includes the basic tools you would expect to see for monitoring the current status of the system and performing basic administrative functions. Both management platforms also offer remote access to the system console, although HPE gets the slight edge here with an installable Windows app. The Dell remote tool has been based on Java, which could cause some issues if your browser has Java execution locked down; however, the company's latest iDRAC release offers an HTML5 version of the remote console that does not require Java. Automating the management of remote systems in a Microsoft shop typically involves the use of Windows PowerShell. Both Dell and HPE provide PowerShell modules for connecting to iDRAC and iLO, respectively. Available PowerShell cmdlets make it possible to automate the process of updating firmware or BIOS images, collecting inventory and much more. You can download the HP Scripting Tools for Windows PowerShell or the Dell PowerShell cmdlets for PowerEdge Servers for free. Wrap Up Starting prices for the Dell PowerEdge R930 come in at $9598.99, while the HPE ProLiant DL580 starts out at $10,811.99. Prices go up quickly as you might imagine when you add lots of memory and the high-end processors. Other configuration options like higher wattage power supplies and fast networking components can run the price up as well. Both of these systems deliver a huge amount of power in a single 4U box. If you have a server or workload consolidation projects in your future, you would do well to consider one of these workhorses for your solution.

X IBM, Intel and Ryanair at conference to unite designers and developers Tickets also selling fast for Uprise, which comes to Dublin for the first time this month Thu, Oct 6, 2016, 06:45 Charlie Taylor The Web Summit may be no more but the RDS will be hosting two tech festivals in the coming weeks         The divide between designers and developers will be addressed at a major new tech conference to be held in Dublin early next month. Senior speakers from Intel, IBM and Ryanair will all be speaking at UXDX, which takes place in the RDS on November 2nd. UXDX stands for User Experience (UX), Experience Design (XD) and Developer Experience (DX). Among the speakers at this year’s event are Douglas Powell, design principal at IBM; David Boundy, director of IoT (Internet of Things) at Intel; and Ryanair’s head of development, David O’Callaghan, who leads a team that has responsibility for transforming the airline into a “digital company that flies planes”. “UXDX is for all parties involved in product development: it’s about designers, developers, product owners and project managers at all stages of their careers coming together to share their perspectives, learn from each other and find the best way forward,” said event director Catherine Madden. Sponsors of this year’s event include the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Fáilte Ireland, Meet in Ireland, Frontend.com, Optimal Workshop, FR Kelly, Dublin UX and the Digital Hub. Uprise Festival Separately, tickets are selling fast for the Uprise Festival, which takes place at the RDS on October 20th. The event is the brainchild of Amsterdam-based Irishman Paul O’Connell, who founded the festival in Holland last year but is now expanding it to Ireland. Promising “no public wifi for the 2, 000 attendees, no big guest speakers and no apps to lose yourself in,” the start-up focused festival promises to showcase some 150 innovative young companies, and provide practical workshops and panels from Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Salesforce, Freelance.com and Seedrs to mention just a few. “We will be ending Uprise with our Epic Pitch battle which will see six handpicked international start-ups taking on six Irish-based ones in an event in which the audience chooses the winner,” said Mr O’Connell.

Reuters/Robert Galbraith Apple iMac 2016 featuring a 5K display could be coming this October. Fans are now waiting for a major announcement from Apple to set the mood for the holiday season. While the Cupertino-based technology giant may also release other products, the iMac 2016 is eagerly-anticipated. This is because, reports suggest Apple has upgraded the iMac and included some amazing features and specs along with a revamped look and feel. Apple has a history of releasing devices in the end of October. However, many tech enthusiasts believe that major overhauls to the iMac are unlikely though an Intel processor is expected, Mobile & Apps. Even though Apple succeeds in unveiling a revolutionary iMac 2016, Intel’s highly-hyped Kaby Lake processors may not find a place inside the device as they will reportedly coming end of this year. Instead, a Polaris AMD processor is also very likely. AMD recently won a contract with Apple for its graphics chips. Gamers are expecting that the Apple iMac 2016 will have some specs/features that will help in improving the gaming experience in the device. Polaris graphics chips are known for lower power consumption and high speeds. The chips significantly better resolution to make the gaming experience more satisfying. An Apple iMac 2016 with VR capability is also expected. Polaris 10 and 11 are looking to improvise on the VR experience and fans may expect some real excitement on this front. Fusion drive may become the default storage for the iMac 2016. The flash storage may also become the storage standard for the Apple iMac 2016 that may result in better read and write speeds. Apple iMac has been a very popular device but interest in it has waned a bit due to a number of other exciting devices from the same company. This time Apple should try and release an iMac 2016 with more exciting features and specs to gain back some of its lost popularity.

TRENDING NOW: Watch Dogs 2 first impressions Home News CPU, APU & Chipsets Intel's huge LGA 3647 socket teases Knights Landing Knights Landing teased through a new image of Intel's upcoming LGA 3647 socket By: Anthony Garreffa | CPU, APU & Chipsets News | Posted: Oct 6, 2016 4:41 am Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Intel has something truly monstrous with its upcoming Knights Landing LGA 3647 socket, with Serve the Home teasing us with some pictures of the gigantic LGA 3647 socket.     The upcoming Knights Landing platform will support 6-channel DDR4 support, as well as no dual-latch system that is used on the LGA 2011 platform. Serve the Home explains that the socket and thermal designs that they have seen "do not have latching mechanisms", and instead they're seeing "solutions that secure the CPU to the heat sink".     Here we have a comparison shot of Broadwell-EP, LGA 3657 (Knights Landing), and Broadwell-DE.     STH had an Intel Xeon D (Broadwell-DE) BGA package next to the massive LGA 3674 socket, and it looks super small.     The entire assembly is then guided into place by the socket pins, with screws flanking the heat sink to secure it in place. Supermicro's 2U4N solution's heat sink you can see above handles 200W TDP in a 1U high chassis.   These new monster LGA 3647 socket CPUs won't be for most desktop users, but for those who want impossible amounts of CPU cores and RAM - then the new Knights Landing platform should be at the top of your Christmas list.

The new models feature Intel Kaby Lake processors and slightly bigger batteries than their predecessors. But otherwise the new Dell XPS 13 laptops are a lot like the models Dell has released for the past few years: they’re thin, they’re light, they have affordable starting prices, and there are even a few models that come with Ubuntu Linux instead of Windows 10. The new XPS 13 laptops were unveiled a few weeks ago, and now they’re available from Dell.com for $800 and up. The laptop measures about 0.6 inches thick and weighs about 2.7 pounds, features a carbon fiber and aluminum body, and has super-slim bezels, allowing Dell to put a 13.3 inch display on a notebook that’s closer to the size you’d expect from a 12 inch model. An entry-level model features a 1920 x 1080 pixel display, an Intel Core i3-7100U processor, 4GB of RAM, 128GB of solid state storage, and a 60 Wh battery. But Dell also offers models with up to a Core i7-7500U CPU, up to 16GB of RAM, and up to 512GB of solid state storage. Some higher-priced models also have 3200 x 1800 pixel touchscreen displays. Each laptop has two USB 3.0 ports, a Thunderbolt 3/USB 3.1 Type-C port, an SD card reader, and a headset jack as well as a 720p webcam, 802.11ac WiFi, and Bluetooth 4.1.

Intel is turning to the cloud to make its consumer security capabilities more effective. The chip maker's security group this week unveiled enhancements to its McAfee AntiVirus Plus, Internet Security, Total Protection and LifeSafe software suite that aim to protect the growing number and variety of connected devices consumers are using as the internet of things (IoT) ecosystem continues to grow. "People are enjoying more and more connected devices as part of everyday life—in their homes, in their cars and even in the things they wear," John Giamatteo, corporate vice president and general manager at Intel Security, said in a statement. "This wave of new connectivity is exciting, and a reminder that security is more important than ever. We know our customers need solutions that protect their digital lives, particularly as connectivity continues to rise and threats continue to evolve." The enhanced security offerings are aimed at both PCs and Apple Macs, as well as mobile devices running on Apple's iOS and Google's Android mobile operating systems. Central to the upgraded lineup is the McAfee Next Generation Anti-Malware Engine, which uses behavioral analytics and machine learning to better automatically detect and block malware as it arises without having to rely on human research, according to Intel officials. It's also more efficient and effective at detecting malware threats by offloading the analytics work to the cloud, they said. In addition, Intel Security's True Key provides multifactor authentication to enable consumers to log in to websites safely using such technologies as facial recognition and fingerprints. Among the updates to the software are master password reset and the ability to import data from other password managers. The True Key app is included with LifeSafe, Total Protection and Internet Security. Intel Security also is offering enhancements to protection features for Mac and Android devices that officials said increases the ability to detect threats in the systems. The chip maker also is making a Virus Protection Pledge that comes when a customer's subscription is renewed automatically, promising that if a consumer's device is infected with a virus they can't handle, the McAfee support group will remove it or the customer gets a refund. In announcing the enhancements, company officials pointed to not only the growing number of connected devices consumers are using but also the rise in threats to those devices, particularly ransomware. According to the McAfee Labs Threat Report released in June, new ransomware—wherein hackers steal data and refuse to give it back until a ransom has been paid—has grown 120 percent since the first quarter 2015. At the same time, most consumers now own at least three connected devices, putting a greater emphasis on the need for enhanced security capabilities, they said. Intel Security's announcement comes a month before the company's Focus 2016 security show, which runs Nov. 1-3 in Las Vegas. It also comes a month after Intel announced it is spinning out its cyber-security software business in a partnership with private equity firm TPG in a deal worth about $4.2 billion. Intel and TPG will create a new, independent company based on the Intel Security unit and retaining the name the McAfee name. TPG will own 51 percent of the new company, while Intel will own the other 49 percent. Intel bought McAfee in early 2011 for $7.6 billion with the idea of integrating more security capabilities into its chips to offer better protection from everything from PCs to servers. The unit has made money over the years, but officials are steering the company in other directions to address such emerging markets as IoT, virtual reality, the cloud and data center systems.           LATEST SECURITY ARTICLES   IoT Devices Evolving Rapidly as Favorite DDoS Attack Tool, Experts Say Dell Data Protection Defends Against External, Insider Threats Kaspersky Alleges Microsoft's Windows Defender Is Anti-Competitive Linux Foundation Back Reproducible Builds Effort for Secure Software Network Worm Could Infect 'Smart' Home Devices, Researchers Show                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

The San Francisco Fashion Week: Ready to Wear Showcase was held in the DZINE furniture gallery on the evening of Oct. 1. Two of the three designers are actually scientists. A crowd waits for the fashion show to start outside the DZINE furniture gallery in San Francisco. (Qing Li/ Epoch Times) Kitty Yeung, a hardware engineer at Intel with a Ph.D. in applied physics from Harvard University, brought 12 pieces of her work to show to the audience. The prints on the fabrics are all her own paintings, including a Chinese-style lotus, a spring in the Harvard yard, and a painting of Jupiter. The paintings show her love of nature and science. She also blended Internet of Things (IoT), sensors, and wearable technology into her design. One of her pieces has dynamic sleeves that look like wings on the shoulders. Yeung herself was wearing a headset with a sensor. She explained that the headset is a product from BrainCo that can detect one’s brain signal and the movement of one’s head, and it is connected to LED lights on her dress. The LED lights change color based on the motion of her head. “I think in the future people will wear electronics [in] their fabrics,” Yeung said. Kitty Yeung, a hardware engineer at Intel and a fashion designer, explains to a reporter how her dress works. The headset she is wearing can control the LED lights on her dress. (Qing Li, Epoch Times) The theme of the fashion show also attracted many professionals working in the tech industry. Arpita Patel, Rowena Zuniga, Teresa Mao, and Arpita Shrivastava, who are all software engineers in the San Francisco Bay Area, attended the event. They were inspired by how the designers think outside the box and apply technology to fashion.

The fashion show made her think about its applications. She was also amazed by the creativity of the female designers. “Especially for females, it’s not just engineering that is defining them. It’s also their own personal interests along with the engineering skill set they have got there. They’re just putting it out there. We are just very inspired,” Patel said.

Panasonic Toughbook, look out. By: Steven Bassiri | Editorials in Laptops | Posted: Oct 7, 2016 7:54 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Page 1 [Dell's Rugged and Extremely Rugged Products] Page 1 [Dell's Rugged and Extremely Rugged Products] Page 2 [Testing Out Dell's Claims - Part 1] Page 3 [Testing Out Dell's Claims - Part 2] Page 4 [Global Command Center] Page 5 [Where Dell Is Headed] Dell's Rugged and Extremely Rugged Products     A rugged military-grade product might not be what first comes to mind when you think of Dell, but over the past years, the company has shifted more resources towards building rugged notebooks to compete with the likes of the infamous Panasonic Toughbook. Rugged laptops and tablets have many uses ranging from the obvious military usage scenarios to the less obvious ones such as right through into the kitchen. Dell was kind enough to invite me to Texas where they gave me a firsthand account of their progress with their "Rugged" line of products. I also toured their labs and one of their Global Command Centers. Dell is not only a hardware company but they are also heavily invested in services. Dell's support system for their customers is one of the major benefits of Dell products, and all of their Rugged products will utilize Dell's in-house Global Command Centers, instead of an outsourced partner.     Dell's four main products they showcased include the Latitude 14 Rugged, Latitude 14 Rugged Extreme, Latitude 12 Rugged Extreme, and their Latitude 12 Rugged Tablet. All of these products offer MIL-STD-810G certification, which they get from an independent lab. Over the years, their "Rugged" series of products has shifted from rebadged consumer counterparts, to fully redesigned products that might only use a part of the consumer version's PCB.     Since the target audience for these new products isn't your average consumer, but rather a corporation or governmental body that only upgrades once in a while, Dell is looking to hit very important upgrade cycles when it comes to hardware performance. It's the reason that the new products will mostly be based on Intel's Skylake microarchitecture, as it should serve customers well into the future.     Their Extreme Rugged (Fully Rugged) products offer IP-65 ingress protection, should survive a 6-foot drop, are EMI shielded for use around explosives and hazardous locations, and provide "comprehensive" MIL-STD-810G certification. Their Rugged (also called Semi-Rugged) series offers IP-5X or greater ingress protection and will survive a 3-foot drop. From their experience building rugged products, Dell has realized that to provide a better product, they must build their products to exceed the requirements of certifications such as MIL-STD-810G. Dell even says that after the 6-foot drop test, their Rugged Extreme notebook might still be IP certified, which is something not widely promised by other brands.     I will be reviewing a few of Dell's Rugged products, but I thought you might appreciate a little overview of what they have to offer. Dell has taken what looks to be a physically weak concept of the convertible tablet/notebook and produced the fully-rugged Latitude 12 Rugged Extreme. While some might question the frame and rotating display, the product should stand up to a beating just like the Latitude 14 Rugged Extreme. You might have noticed the RGB keyboards, but they aren't there only for show. Dell mentioned that in different lighting conditions, different colors could be useful, such as red at night.     Dell's Latitude 12 Rugged tablet is attached to a keyboard dock in the picture. A rugged tablet has many uses out in the field, particularly when there is no need for a keyboard, such as an interactive map. We used these tablets attached to jet skis to display a map of Lake Travis, and we proceeded to race around the island as our position was tracked in real-time and displayed on the tablet.     The Latitude 14 Rugged and Latitude 14 Rugged Extreme are what we traditionally think of as a rugged computer. Both carry Dell's 14-inch daylight-readable display and are equipped with the latest in high-performance hardware. Dell is using solid state storage instead of spinning disks, which makes a lot of sense considering the nature of the device. Both are the latest Dell has to offer in terms of durability, and we actually tossed the one on the right off a boat onto a rocky island multiple times. The notebook survived with some external scratches, and there it sits the day after. Next Page Shopping Information PRICING: You can find products similar to this one for sale below.

Now a new kind of transistor design promises to keep it alive for a little longer—though the chip industry is already planning ways to cope when it finally kicks the bucket. The problem currently facing chip design is, sadly, physics itself. Using silicon, it’s impossible to create a transistor in which the gate—the part of a transistor that switches on and off to control the flow of electrons—is smaller than seven nanometers. Make them any smaller, and electrons can move between transistors through a process known as quantum tunneling, which means that a transistor in an “off” state could be unexpectedly switched “on” even if it’s not supposed to be. That places a theoretical limit on Moore’s Law—the idea that the number of transistors that can fit onto a chip doubles every two years or so. But now researchers from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, led by previous TR Innovator Under 35 Ali Javey, have built what’s claimed to be the world’s smallest working transistor. Ali Javey, left, and Sujay Desai have created the world's smallest transistor. Publishing their achievement in Science, the researchers explain that the device has been built using carbon nanotubes and molybdenum disulfide, creating a transistor with a gate length of just one nanometer. It’s an impressive achievement, and—in theory, at least—it means that it would be possible to squeeze far more of the small switches into a chip than could ever be achieved with silicon. For some context, the current state-of-the-art chips use transistors with a 14-nanometer gate, and 10-nanometer chips are on the way. The result is, however, just a proof of concept—a long way from a viable product. Turning these nanotube transistors into a processor would require billions of the switches to be reliably created on a single chip. That may be possible, but it could also be cripplingly expensive. Indeed, the chip industry has already acknowledged that it’s prepared for transistors to stop shrinking. Earlier this year, the Semiconductor Industry Association—made up of the likes of Intel, AMD, and Global Foundries—published a report announcing that by 2021 it will not be economically efficient to reduce the size of silicon transistors any further. Instead, chips look set to change in different ways. We’re already seeing the processor industry fracture, with a movement away from super-fast all-rounder hardware and toward more specialized chips. To that end, Intel recently bought  Movidius, a company that makes chips dedicated to computer vision tasks. Nvidia, meanwhile, is selling specialized AI chips to an industry eager to capitalize on machine learning. More efficient chip designs will also help increase computational speed at lower rates of power consumption. Microsoft and Intel are both working on using reconfigurable chips known as FPGAs to run artificial-intelligence algorithms more efficiently, for instance. And the Japanese telecom and Internet company SoftBank recently acquired British chip designer ARM for its incredibly successful low-power chips, which will provide processing power for the growing crop of Internet-of-things hardware. Less specialized processors will likely change shape to increase processing power. Chips will increasingly use multiple layers of circuitry to increase transistor density, for example. Or, just maybe, they might shrink down using the Berkeley Lab breakthrough to achieve the same ends.

Riskiest Celebrity Names to Click On: Who Made the List? When you search on celebrities' names and click, consider the security risks. Amy Schumer and Justin Bieber top Intel Security's list of most dangerous names to click on. Amy Schumer Takes the No. 1 Spot According to Intel's numbers, consumers have a 16.11 percent chance of hitting on a site loaded with malware that can steal passwords and personal data when they search for her online, and a 33 percent chance when they search "Amy Schumer Torrent." She took over from electronic dance music DJ Armin van Buuren, who was at the top of the 2015 list. Silly With Comedians There was a broad range of comedians on the list, including Kevin Hart at No. 25, Mindy Kaling at 30, Kristen Wiig (pictured) at 52 and Ellen DeGeneres at 57. Justin Bieber Attracts Trouble The pop singer, who has had his share of controversy, comes in at No. 2, with fans having a 15 percent chance of hitting on a malware-laden site when searching online. Singing the Blues Bieber was far from the only singer to make the dangerous celebrities list. There were others in the top 10, and lower on the list were the likes of Drake at No. 13, Katy Perry at No. 14, Justin Timberlake (pictured) at No. 17, Lady Gaga at No. 19 and Beyonce at No. 28. Carson Daly Talks His Way Onto the List The host on NBC's "Today" morning show and "The Voice" reality TV series finds himself at No. 3 on the list, where consumers are at a 13.44 percent risk of infection. Late Night Risks Daly wasn't the only night-time TV host to make the list. Others include Seth Meyers at No. 11, James Corden (pictured) and his popular "Carpool Karaoke" at No. 23, John Oliver at No. 24 and Jimmy Kimmel (who was No. 1 two years ago) now at No. 32. Will Smith in a Dead Heat With Carson Daly Like the TV host, movie star Will Smith, most recently seen in "Suicide Squad," came in with a 13.44 percent malware risk. What's Her Name? It's Rihanna, and the singer, who has a string of top hits, reached No. 5 on the Intel Security list, with fans facing a 13.33 percent risk of getting infected with malware. She Came In Like a Wrecking Ball Singer Miley Cyrus seems to live by the belief that there's no such thing as bad publicity. In that vein, she's sitting at No. 6, with a 12.67 percent risk for those surfing the web for her. Talking Dangerous Those searching online for comedian and actor Chris Hardwick, who also is a businessman (CEO of Nerdist Industries) and talk show host ("Talking Dead"), have a 12.56 percent chance of being directed to a website loaded with malware. Tosh.Malware Daniel Tosh—producer, actor, TV host and No. 8 on Intel Security's list of dangerous celebrities. Those searching for him online face an 11.56 percent chance of hitting on a malware-infected site. More Dangerous Than "Barney" Selena Gomez, the singer and actress who got her start as a child in the TV show "Barney and Friends," is now a regular in the gossip columns and No. 9 on the Intel list, coming in with an 11.11 percent risk for consumers searching for her online. She Is Who She Is And she is singer and rapper Kesha, who like Selena Gomez made the top 10 on Intel's list with a risk factor of 11.11 percent.

She's got a top-rated cable TV show with "Inside Amy Schumer," a few movies on her resume and a growing presence in the debate over gun control. And now, according to Intel Security, she not only is attracting her share of fans, but also the attention of hackers and cyber-criminals. Schumer is at the top of this year's list put out by Intel's security business of the celebrities that generate the most dangerous results when searched online. The McAfee Most Dangerous Celebrities study is in its 10th year, and Schumer has the dubious honor of being the first female comedian to take the top spot. "Consumers today remain fascinated with celebrity culture and go online to find the latest pop culture news," said Gary Davis, chief consumer security evangelist at Intel Security. "With this craving for real-time information, many search and click without considering potential security risks. Cyber-criminals know this and take advantage of this behavior by attempting to lead them to unsafe sites loaded with malware."

Transistor. Ever. Berkeley Lab-led research breaks major barrier in transistor size by creating gate only 1 nanometer long WEBWIRE – Friday, October 7, 2016 Schematic of a transistor with a molybdenum disulfide channel and 1-nanometer carbon nanotube gate. (Credit: Sujay Desai/UC Berkeley) For more than a decade, engineers have been eyeing the finish line in the race to shrink the size of components in integrated circuits. They knew that the laws of physics had set a 5-nanometer threshold on the size of transistor gates among conventional semiconductors, about one-quarter the size of high-end 20-nanometer-gate transistors now on the market. Some laws are made to be broken, or at least challenged. A research team led by faculty scientist Ali Javey at the Department of Energys Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) has done just that by creating a transistor with a working 1-nanometer gate. For comparison, a strand of human hair is about 50,000 nanometers thick. We made the smallest transistor reported to date, said Javey, lead principal investigator of the Electronic Materials program in Berkeley Labs Materials Science Division. The gate length is considered a defining dimension of the transistor. We demonstrated a 1-nanometer-gate transistor, showing that with the choice of proper materials, there is a lot more room to shrink our electronics. The key was to use carbon nanotubes and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), an engine lubricant commonly sold in auto parts shops. MoS2 is part of a family of materials with immense potential for applications in LEDs, lasers, nanoscale transistors, solar cells, and more. The findings were published today in the journal Science. Other investigators on this paper include Jeff Bokor, a faculty senior scientist at Berkeley Lab and a professor at UC Berkeley; Chenming Hu, a professor at UC Berkeley; Moon Kim, a professor at the University of Texas at Dallas; and H.S. Philip Wong, a professor at Stanford University. The development could be key to keeping alive Intel co-founder Gordon Moores prediction that the density of transistors on integrated circuits would double every two years, enabling the increased performance of our laptops, mobile phones, televisions, and other electronics. The semiconductor industry has long assumed that any gate below 5 nanometers wouldnt work, so anything below that was not even considered, said study lead author Sujay Desai, a graduate student in Javeys lab. This research shows that sub-5-nanometer gates should not be discounted. Industry has been squeezing every last bit of capability out of silicon. By changing the material from silicon to MoS2, we can make a transistor with a gate that is just 1 nanometer in length, and operate it like a switch. When electrons are out of control Transistors consist of three terminals: a source, a drain, and a gate. Current flows from the source to the drain, and that flow is controlled by the gate, which switches on and off in response to the voltage applied. Both silicon and MoS2 have a crystalline lattice structure, but electrons flowing through silicon are lighter and encounter less resistance compared with MoS2. That is a boon when the gate is 5 nanometers or longer. But below that length, a quantum mechanical phenomenon called tunneling kicks in, and the gate barrier is no longer able to keep the electrons from barging through from the source to the drain terminals. This means we cant turn off the transistors, said Desai. The electrons are out of control. Because electrons flowing through MoS2 are heavier, their flow can be controlled with smaller gate lengths. MoS2 can also be scaled down to atomically thin sheets, about 0.65 nanometers thick, with a lower dielectric constant, a measure reflecting the ability of a material to store energy in an electric field. Both of these properties, in addition to the mass of the electron, help improve the control of the flow of current inside the transistor when the gate length is reduced to 1 nanometer. Once they settled on MoS2 as the semiconductor material, it was time to construct the gate. Making a 1-nanometer structure, it turns out, is no small feat. Conventional lithography techniques dont work well at that scale, so the researchers turned to carbon nanotubes, hollow cylindrical tubes with diameters as small as 1 nanometer. They then measured the electrical properties of the devices to show that the MoS2 transistor with the carbon-nanotube gate effectively controlled the flow of electrons. This work demonstrated the shortest transistor ever, said Javey, who is also a UC Berkeley professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences. However, its a proof of concept. We have not yet packed these transistors onto a chip, and we havent done this billions of times over. We also have not developed self-aligned fabrication schemes for reducing parasitic resistances in the device. But this work is important to show that we are no longer limited to a 5-nanometer gate for our transistors. Moores Law can continue a while longer by proper engineering of the semiconductor material and device architecture. The work at Berkeley Lab was primarily funded by the Department of Energys Basic Energy Sciences program. ### Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory addresses the worlds most urgent scientific challenges by advancing sustainable energy, protecting human health, creating new materials, and revealing the origin and fate of the universe.

FREE Registration Home News Archive Features Directory Recruitment Events About Us Advertising Contribute News 7 October 2016 Berkeley Lab-led team fabricates transistor with record 1nm-long gate A research team led by faculty scientist Ali Javey at the US Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) has created a transistor with a gate length (the defining dimension of a transistor) just 1nm long, which is the smallest reported to date ('MoS2 transistors with 1-nanometer gate lengths', Science Vol. 354, Issue 6308, p99-102). For conventional semiconductors, the laws of physics set a 5nm threshold on the size of transistor gates (about a quarter the size of high-end 20nm-gate transistors currently on the market). However, the 1nm-gate transistor show that "with the choice of proper materials, there is a lot more room to shrink our electronics," says Javey, lead principal investigator of the Electronic Materials program in Berkeley Lab's Materials Science Division (and a University of California Berkeley professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences). The key was to use carbon nanotubes and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). Other investigators on the paper include Jeff Bokor, a senior faculty scientist at Berkeley Lab and a professor at UC Berkeley; Chenming Hu, a professor at UC Berkeley; Moon Kim, a professor at the University of Texas at Dallas; and H.S. Philip Wong, a professor at Stanford University. The new development could be key to keeping alive Intel co-founder Gordon Moore's prediction that the density of transistors on integrated circuits would double every two years. "The semiconductor industry has long assumed that any gate below 5nm wouldn't work, so anything below that was not even considered," says study lead author Sujay Desai, a graduate student in Javey's lab. "This research shows that sub-5nm gates should not be discounted. Industry has been squeezing every last bit of capability out of silicon. By changing the material from silicon to MoS2, we can make a transistor with a gate that is just 1nm in length, and operate it like a switch." Picture: Schematic of transistor with a MoS2 channel and 1nm carbon nanotube gate. (Courtesy of Sujay Desai/Berkeley Lab.) Both silicon and MoS2 have a crystalline lattice structure, but electrons flowing through silicon are lighter and encounter less resistance compared with MoS2. That is a benefit when the gate is 5nm or longer, but below that length the quantum mechanical phenomenon of tunneling kicks in and the gate barrier is no longer able to keep the electrons from barging through from the source to the drain terminals. "This means we can't turn off the transistors," says Desai. "The electrons are out of control." Because electrons flowing through MoS2 are heavier, their flow can be controlled with smaller gate lengths. MoS2 can also be scaled down to atomically thin sheets (about 0.65nm thick) with a lower dielectric constant (reflecting the ability of the material to store energy in an electric field). Both of these properties, in addition to the mass of the electron, help to improve the control of current flow inside the transistor when the gate length is reduced to 1nm. For constructing the transistor's gate, conventional lithography techniques do not work well at a scale of 1nm, so the researchers turned to hollow cylindrical carbon nanotubes with diameters as small as 1nm. They then measured the electrical properties of the devices to show that the MoS2 transistor with the carbon nanotube gate effectively controlled the flow of electrons. Picture: Transmission electron microscope image of a cross-section of the transistor, showing 1nm carbon nanotube gate and molybdenum disulfide semiconductor separated by the insulator zirconium dioxide. (Courtesy of Qingxiao Wang, UT Dallas.) "However, it's a proof of concept. We have not yet packed these transistors onto a chip, and we haven't done this billions of times over," notes Javey. "We also have not developed self-aligned fabrication schemes for reducing parasitic resistances in the device. But this work is important to show that we are no longer limited to a 5nm gate for our transistors. Moore's Law can continue a while longer by proper engineering of the semiconductor material and device architecture." The work at Berkeley Lab was funded primarily by the Department of Energy's Basic Energy Sciences program.

By Owen Hughes October 7, 2016 15:12 BST Facebook is working on a mid-range, standalone virtual reality headset. The device, currently nicknamed Santa Cruz, will sit between the Gear VR and Oculus Rift in Facebook's product line-up in terms of affordability, and will likely count Google's recently-announced Daydream View amongst its main competitors. Generally speaking, virtual reality currently forces users to choose between basic, budget headsets such as those supported by Google Cardboard, and the high-fidelity yet costly experiences afforded by devices like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. Samsung's Gear VR, also powered by Facebook's Oculus, goes some way towards locating a middle ground in terms of affordability, but compatibility is limited to a handful of Samsung devices. There is, therefore, a need to target consumers who want an affordable but high-quality VR headset that isn't tied down to a mobile device or PC. A number of tech companies are now developing such devices, including Intel, Qualcomm and Alcatel. Speaking at the Oculus Connect conference in San Francisco on 6 October, CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that virtual reality needs to offer more wallet-friendly experiences while not sacrificing too much on quality. "We believe that there is a sweet spot, a standalone virtual reality product category that is high quality and affordable, and you can bring with you out into the world," he said. "We're working on this now. It's still early, so don't get your hopes up too much." Facebook's social VR avatars are now more expressiveFacebook Zuckerberg briefly showcased the Santa Cruz prototype on stage while showcasing the updates in Facebook's social VR platform. First demoed back at the F8 conference in April, the software now features more accurate avatars capable of portraying basic facial expressions based on voice analysis. The social VR platform was noticeably more feature-rich than it was at its initial debut, with Zuckerberg and his colleagues able to more deeply engage with each other within the virtual space. All of this was shown running on Facebook's new wireless device, although neither it nor the social VR software were given a release date. Facebook will be keen to push a mid-range virtual reality product given the imminent arrival of PlayStation VR and Google's Daydream View, both of which promise to offer high-quality virtual reality at a more affordable price. While both headsets are tied to external devices, they are expected to be popular due to the large user bases of the PS4 and Android smartphones.

The automakers – Audi, BMW and Daimler – have formed the “5G Automotive Association” together with Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia and Qualcomm. The group’s aim is to test and promote 5G and agree on standards for it. Automakers need 5G to support their goal of putting driverless cars on the road sometime in the next decade. Autonomous vehicles need to be able to send and receive large amounts of data almost instantly, which is impossible with the current 4G or LTE standard. By adopting the 5G standard, networks will be able to handle much more data, connect many more devices, reduce latency and bring new levels of reliability, the association said in a press release. “Next-generation mobile networks will take car-to-x connectivity to a new level,” Alfons Pfaller, head of infotainment development at Audi, said. The 5G association, which is open to additional members, expects, among other things, to run joint projects that can result in integrated solutions and large-scale pilots and trial deployments.   Rate this article   Read automotiveIT international magazine Related Articles Audi, BMW, Daimler jointly acquire Nokia HERE Nokia HERE: Accenture consultant sees more acquisitions carIT Congress – Hanover VW launches car-sharing program as new mobility initiatives increase Vodafone joins automotive 5G alliance PDF VERSION · Print this page Tags: 5g, Audi, BMW, connected car, Daimler, ericsson, huawei, intel, nokia, qualcomm, vw Share this article: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook E-Mail Our Websites Media-Manufaktur Corporate automotiveIT - Germany automotiveIT Kongress automotiveIT Forum Industrie 4.0 automotiveIT International business impact - Germany carIT - Germany carIT Kongress Poll Where will automakers get the greatest benefit from big data?

Image: Marina Lopes We’re So Addicted to Our Gadgets That ‘Unplugged’ Tourism Is Booming Written by Marina Lopes October 7, 2016 // 08:00 AM EST Copy This URL If a tree falls in the Amazon, but you don’t capture it on Snapchat, did it actually fall? I had the thought while hiking through the rainforest, on the third day of a digital detox that was slowly killing me. What’s the point of eating a live worm or luring a monkey onto my shoulder if I can’t post the photos to prove it? These days, vacation can feel like work. Between Facebook updates, Instagram posts and tweets of your shower thoughts, memorializing your vacation can overpower the trip itself. In fact, 41 percent of millennials feel that their phones are keeping them from living in the moment when traveling, according to a JWT Intelligence consumer trends survey. And over half of those who plan on unplugging during vacation aren’t able to, according to an Intel digital behavior study. So how much are tech addicts (i.e. most of us) willing to pay for someone to cut them off? It turns out, quite a lot. And the travel industry is readily capitalizing on our addiction to glowing screens. Well, somebody needed to take a picture of this hammock. Image: Marina Lopes Lack of WiFi and cell service, once unforgivable for any hotel, have become selling points at places like La Pause, in Morocco. Nestled between desert sand dunes, it has no electricity or cell service, but offers luxury tents with egyptian cotton linens and bathrobes for $250 a night. Similarly, at Petit St. Vincent, a secluded Caribbean resort averaging $1,000 a night, the phone never rings. Residents use flag poles outside their bungalows to communicate with management. “People don’t know how to disconnect. That’s why there’s this demand. It’s catering to soul searchers, people are looking to get to know themselves again,” said Adriana Lacerda, a travel consultant at Plantel Tourism. “Technology prevents this self-reflection. You are connected to other people, but not really.” Unplugged tourism is like rehab for the traveler whose thumb flicks upward at the first sign of boredom. And digital breaks can have actual health benefits. Studies show that heavy users of technology suffer more mental illness and have trouble sleeping. Over the summer, in search of this elusive freedom from technology, I took a plane, two boats and a van into the heart of the Amazon. I wanted to trade in my Spotify playlist for a creaking hammock and reconnect with nature. Juma Lodge promised just that. The secluded hotel is made up of 21 thatched-roof huts swaying on stilts at the basin of the Paraná do Araçá River. For $300 a night, the hotel boasted a return to the basics. There were no televisions, telephones, and certainly no wifi. The only means of communication with the outside world was five radios, used strictly for emergencies. Juma Lodge. Image: Marina Lopes The lodge was packed with overworked businessmen, european lawyers and a high schooler looking for a college essay topic. The first days were pure bliss. I went on a midnight hike through the jungle, learned how to crack open vines to get drinking water in the wild and hunted alligators in the moonlight. I journaled and reflected on life as I watched the sunset. I had no idea what was happening beyond my immediate surroundings. But halfway through the week, withdrawal took over. The heat and stillness leveled me and I needed a break from my own mind. I wondered about the Twittersphere. What was I missing? Which videos went viral, what did the latest election polls show, who Taylor Swift was dating? But with no option to cheat on my detox, I pushed the thoughts away and learned how to build shelter from banana leaves instead. I was startled a few days later, when on a rickety boat halfway to the mainland, my phone buzzed alive. I slowly swiped it on, submerging myself back into civilization. It turns out the internet hadn’t missed me nearly as much as I missed it. Within five minutes, I was all caught up. With a sigh of relief, I turned my phone off and enjoyed the last few hours of my vacation. Get six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day by signing up for our newsletter.

This October, the tech giant is set to release new devices and many fans are excited to see the outcome. Microsoft Hardware Event The tech giant has no doubt saturated the tech market with all their hardware and software offerings. There's the Windows OS environment, the Xbox consoles, and the multi-platform Surface devices. Of these devices, however, fans have been most eagerly waiting for the next generation of Surface devices to come. As Microsoft is set to host an event this month, will we see the new Surface devices? Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit Surface Pro 5 Microsoft remains silent regarding concrete updates regarding the next generation Surface Pro 5. However, reports have stated that the hybrid device will sport impressive specs that will make the Surface Pro 5 stand out among the highly saturated tech market. They have also stated that the device will definitely be one of the highlights of the event. The Surface Pro 5 is set to feature the new Windows 10 Redstone 2 update as its operating system.

Microsoft makes patch data RESTful Mostly-forgotten silicon-maker Zilog is alive and has just released a new product that shares a little DNA with the Z80 CPU that powered many of the earliest mass-market microcomputers. The Z80 famously powered Sinclair's iconic ZX 80, ZX 81 and Spectrum computers. The CPU also made it into the Radio Shack TRS-80, the Osborne 1, the Microbee and many more machines. The CPU was compatible with Intel's 8080 and was arguably better and cheaper too, but before long the IBM PC came along and that meant a decade or three of difficulty for just about all PC CPU makers other than Intel. Zilog and the Z80 persisted, though, despite bankruptcy, acquisition and many adventures. Today it is a subsidiary of Dutch semiconductor concern IXYS, which keeps the brand alive. So what's Zilog up to now? Well on Thursday this week, Zilog announced “ the IXRD1004 - High Power Two-Phase Digital Power Factor Correction (PFC) reference design … based on Zilog’s 8-bit Z8F6481 microcontroller, a member of the Z8 Encore! XP F6482 series of microcontrollers.” The Z8 Encore! is the heir to the Z8, a microcontroller that debuted in 1979 and offered a completely different architecture to the Z80. The two did, however, have very similar instruction sets and assembly syntax. Hence our “very, very distant relative” description in the subhead. Zilog says the new product “provides a platform for developing a number of power management solutions such as electric vehicle chargers, air conditioning systems, high-power LED lighting, and welding equipment.” Okay, okay, that's not something many of you will use any time soon. But if nothing else it is nice to know Zilog's still around, and still relevant. If only so that those of us who remember the company's heyday can say the same.

Yahoo case brings back the Edward Snowden effect USA TODAY 07/10/2016 Elizabeth Weise © Thomas Kienzle, epa Edward Snowden appears from Russia to people in Stuttgart, Germany, in 2014. SAN FRANCISCO — The Edward Snowden effect just made an encore, thanks to a report  Yahoo has been scanning incoming emails on behalf of U.S. intelligence officials.  And it's likely to take a few more bows. U.S. technology companies, already in defensive mode thanks to the former NSA contractor's revelations of a mass government surveillance program in 2013, are even more data-hungry today and therefore more on edge.  From big data to the cloud to artificial intelligence you can talk to in your kitchen, the tech world is busy spinning the straw of information it gathers about users into gold. While the privacy of corporate data has long been a concern among civil libertarians, a consumer flashpoint came when former NSA contractor Snowden released a trove of classified information about a mass NSA phone spying program. A federal appeals court later ruled the bulk collection of phone data was illegal under the Patriot Act, but the damage to the reputation of U.S. computer companies was done. The Snowden effect — heightened public fear about information security and privacy in the wake of his revelations — looms large as the power of the data troves being amassed by companies grows. The potential to gain an edge with this data and sophisticated systems that model human behavior has been guiding big shifts in corporate strategy. Some of the most recent include Microsoft's purchase of LinkedIn and Salesforce's interest in the professional network as well as Twitter (both seen as plays for data); aggressive expansion into cloud computing by Microsoft, Google and Intel; and a stream of artificial intelligence-powered devices like Google’s new Pixel phone and Home speaker, which aim to use your responses to make a "personal Google." With an estimated 1 billion active users a month worldwide and 81 million active Yahoo Mail users in the United States, Yahoo is a nexus for such data. On Wednesday a federal law enforcement official told USA TODAY that the government directive ordering Yahoo to scan customer emails was issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. That's the closed  court in Washington D.C. that oversees requests for surveillance warrants for foreign intelligence purposes. The directive asked Yahoo to essentially sift through incoming email streams for a digital signature associated with a known terror organization.   Unresolved issues While the Yahoo saga is still developing, the questions it raises show the dilemmas faced by companies with a voracious need for data about their customers but also a user base that might turn on them should they find the companies have aided the government in spying on them. Simmering under the surface is a fraught, unresolved legal and public battle between U.S. tech companies and the U.S. government over user privacy on the one hand and the need for intelligence in an age of terrorism on the other. Multiple recent legal battles highlight the tension.  In July, a court ruled that Microsoft couldn't be forced to give the U.S. government e-mails stored in Ireland that are part of a U.S. drug investigation. It's expected the ruling will be appealed possibly all the way to the Supreme Court. Apple fought the Department of Justice for 43 days earlier this year over whether the computer company should be forced to overwrite the software to hack into an iPhone used by San Bernardino gunman Syed Rizwan Farook. The dispute ended only when the FBI found another way into the phone.  Last October the 15-year old Safe Harbor pact, which created a legal framework for data transfers between the United States and the European Union, was declared invalid by the European Court of Justice over concerns about the U.S. mass surveillance Snowden revealed. It was replaced by a more transparent agreement, the Privacy Shield, in July.  News of Yahoo's possible capitulation to a much broader U.S. sweep of its data than ever before reported will likely cause more European concern.  “Without a doubt lots of European regulators will be pointing to this as exactly the sort of thing they were concerned about,” said Scott Vernick, an information security and privacy partner at the law firm of Fox Rothschild in Philadelphia. The European Union is also investigating Facebook for possible misuse of data, on the theory that it is so dominate in several European countries that people are accepting a lower degree of privacy for their personal data because they feel they must use the service.  Privacy, monetization and investment In terms of business models, most large tech companies would wither if they lost access to information about their users’ online lives. “They certainly don’t want to lock it away from themselves – they absolute need it to monetize it,” said Jeff Pollard, a privacy and security analyst with Forrester, a consulting company. The rise of chat bots and artificial intelligence (AI) agents is a case in point. Amazon has invested heavily in its popular and groundbreaking Alexa digital assistant, which learns not just users' voices but also their preferences so it can make better guesses at what they're asking for.   Facebook hopes its Messenger chat bot will allow businesses to talk to, and more importantly sell to, customers by providing "really awesome experiences," in the words of the project head, David Marcus. Those experiences get better the more the AI knows about the user, allowing it to make better-educated guesses about their needs and desires. Samsung just this week announced it was buying Viv, machine-learning virtual assistant company started by Siri founder Dag Kittlaus. But as he acknowledged, smarter smartphones will have to deal with balancing consumer's desire for privacy with the artificial intelligence's voracious need for more data about them. So far, all the big U.S. tech companies are saying they were not asked to do what Yahoo is said to have done, and if they had been, they would have fought it. In Apple's words, "We have never received a request of this type. If we were to receive one, we would oppose it in court." How this dilemma will ultimately be resolved is unclear, with experts saying many legal battles are likely still ahead and a possible growing chasm between what's acceptable in the United States and in Europe. Long term, pushback could come not just from consumers, but investors themselves. Michael Gordon CEO of Group Gordon, a New York-based corporate and crisis public relations firm, said companies such as Yahoo that collect massive amounts of user data must tread carefully.  Once a company gets stuck with a label of lackluster data protection, he said, “investors or users will automatically assume the worst.”  Elizabeth Weise covers technology and cybersecurity for USA TODAY.

Panoramics Photos Rec.humor.funny Joke Site Robocar Bog Twitter Best of Blog Brad's Home Robocars.com Home » Topic » Robocars Tesla Radar, MobilEye fight and the Comma One $1,000 add-on-box Submitted by brad on Sat, 2016-09-17 17:13. Robocars Tesla’s spat with MobilEye reached a new pitch this week, and Tesla announced a new release of their autopilot and new plans. As reported here earlier, MobilEye announced during the summer that they would not be supplying the new and better versions of their EyeQ system to Tesla. Since that system was and is central to the operation of the Telsa autopilot, they may have been surprised that MBLY stock took a big hit after that announcement (though it recovered for a while and is now back down) and TSLA did not. Statements and documents now show a nastier battle, with MobilEye intimating they were worried about Tesla using their tool in an unsafe way, invoking all the debate about the fatality and other crashes allegedly caused by people who are lulled into not bothering to supervise the autopilot. Tesla says that instead they have been developing their own advanced vision tools, and that MobilEye was afraid of that and told Tesla that if they wanted more EyeQ chips, they would need to halt the competing project and commit to ME. That’s a nasty spat. Tesla’s own efforts represent a threat to MobilEye from the growing revolution in neural network pattern matchers. Computer vision is going through a big revolution. MobilEye is a big player in that revolution, because their ASICs do both standard machine vision functions and can do neural networks. An ASIC will beat a general purpose processor when it comes to cost, speed and power, but only if the ASIC’s abilities were designed to solve those particular problems. Since it takes years to bring an ASIC to production, you have to aim right. MobilEye aimed pretty well, but at the same time lots of research out there is trying to aim even better, or do things with more general purpose chips like GPUs. Soon we will see ASICs aimed directly at neural network computations. To solve the problem with neural networks, you need the computing horsepower, and you need well designed deep network architectures, and you need the right training data and lots of it. Tesla and ME both are gaining lots of training data. Many companies, including Nvidia, Intel and others are working on the hardware for neural networks. Most people would point to Google as the company with the best skills in architecting the networks, though there are many doing interesting work there. (Google’s DeepMind built the tools that beat humans at the seemingly impossible game of Go, for example.) It’s definitely a competitive race. Using Radar While Tesla works on their vision systems, they also announced a plan to make much more use of radar. That’s an interesting plan. Radar has been the poor 3rd-class sensor of the robocar, after LIDAR and vision. Everybody uses it — you would be crazy not to unless you need to be very low cost. Radar sees further than the other systems, and it tells you immediately how fast any radar target you see is moving relative to you. It sees through fog and other weather, and it can even see under and around big cars in front of you as it bounces off the road and other objects. It’s really good at licence plates as well. What radar doesn’t have is high resolution. Today’s automotive radars have gotten good enough to tell you what lane an object like another car is in, but they are not designed to have any vertical resolution — you will get radar returns from a stalled car ahead of you on the road and a sign above that lane, and not be sure of the difference. You need your car to avoid a stalled car in your lane, but you can’t have a car that hits the brakes every time it sees a road sign or bridge! Real world radar is messy. Your antennas send out and receive from a very broad cone with potential signals from other directions and from side lobes. Reflections are coming from vehicles and road users but also from the ground, hills, trees, fences, signs, bushes and bridges. It’s work to get reliable information from it. Early automotive radars found the best solution was to use the doppler speed information, and discard all returns from anything that wasn’t moving towards or away from you — including stalled cars and cross traffic. One thing that can help (imperfectly) is a map. You can know where the bridges and signs are so you don’t brake for them. Now you can brake for the stalled cars and the cross traffic the Tesla failed to see. You still have an issue with a stalled car under a bridge or sign, but you’re doing a lot better. There’s a lot of room for improvement in radar, and I will presume — Tesla has not said — that Tesla plans to work on this. The automotive radars everybody buys (from companies like Bosch) were made for the ADAS market — adaptive cruise control, emergency braking etc. It is possible to design new radars with more resolution (particularly in the vertical) and other approaches. You can also try for more resolution, particularly by splitting the transmitter and receiver to produce a synthetic larger aperture. You can go into different bands and get more bandwidth and get more resolution in general. You can play more software tricks, and most particularly, you can learn by examining not just single radar returns, but rather the pattern of returns over time. (After all, humans don’t navigate from still frames, we depend on our visual system’s deep evolved ability to use motion and other clues to understand the world.) The neural networks are making strides here. For example, while pedestrians produce basic radar returns, it turns out that their walking stride has a particular pattern of changes that can be identified by neural networks. People are doing research now on how examining the moving and dynamic pattern of radar returns can help you get more resolution and also identify shapes and motion patterns of objects and figure out what they are. I will also speculate that it might be possible to return to a successor of the “sweeped” radars of old, the ones we are used to seeing in old war movies. Modern car radars don’t scan like that, but I have to wonder if with new techniques, like phased arrays to steer virtual beams (already the norm in military radar) and modern high speed electronics, that we might produce radars that get a better sense of where their target is. We’re also getting better at sensor fusion — identifying a radar target in an image or LIDAR return to help learn more about it. The one best way to improve radar resolution would be to use more bandwidth. There have been experiments in using ultrawideband signals in the very high frequencies which may offer promise. As the name suggests, UWB uses a very wide band, and it distributes its energy over that very wide band, which means it doesn’t put too much energy into any one band, and has less chance of interfering in those bands. It’s also possible that the FCC, seeing the tremendous public value that reliable robocars offer, might consider opening up more spectrum for use in radar applications using modern techniques, and thus increase the resolution. In other words, Tesla is wise to work on getting more from radar. With the loss of all MobilEye’s vision tools, they will have to work hard to duplicate and surpass that. For now, Tesla is committed to using parts that are for sale for existing production cars, costing hundreds of dollars. That has taken LIDAR “off their radar” even though almost all research teams depend on LIDAR and expect LIDAR to be cheap in a couple of years. (Including the LIDAR from Quanergy, a company I advise.) Comma announces a $1,000 autopilot box I wrote earlier about comma.ai and their efforts to drive with just vision, radar and neural networks. They now plan to offer a box for $1,000 to give you some basic autopilot functionlity as an add-on. To do this, they are working with only some specific car models, namely some Honda vehicles that already have advanced ADAS in them. Using the car’s internal bus, they can talk to the sensors in these cars (in particular the radar, since the Comma One has a camera) and also send control signals to actuate the steering, brakes and throttle. Then their neural networks can take the sensor information, and output the steering and speed commands to keep you in the lane. (Details are scant so I don’t know if the Comma One box uses its own camera or depends on access to the car’s.) When I rode in Comma’s prototype it certainly wasn’t up to the level of the Tesla autopilot or some others, but it has been several months so I can’t judge it now. Like the Tesla autopilot, the Comma will not be safe enough to drive the car on its own, and you will need to supervise and be ready to intervene at any time. If you get complacent, as some Tesla drivers have, you could get injured or killed. I have yet to learn what measures Comma will take to make sure people keep their eyes on the road. Generally, I feel that autopilots are not very exciting products when you have to watch them all the time — as you do — and also that bolt-on products are also not particularly exciting. Cruise’s initial plan (after they abandoned valet parking) was a bolt-on autopilot, but they soon switched to trying to build a real vehicle, and that got them the huge $700M sale to General Motors. But for Comma, there is a worthwhile angle. Users of this bolt-on box will be helping to provide training data to improve their systems. In fact they will be paying for the privilege of testing the system and training it. Something that companies like Google did the old fashioned way, paying a staff of professionals to drive the cars and gather data. For a tiny, young startup it’s a worthwhile approach. » brad's blog "Nvidia, Intel and others Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Sun, 2016-09-18 14:22.

At present I have not seen indication Google plans to sell them, though you can rent them in Google’s cloud offerings in theory. » reply "can talk to the sensors in Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Sun, 2016-09-18 14:37. "can talk to the sensors in these cars (in particular the radar, since it has a camera)" -- this is very confusing: there is no camera inside the radar (or is there?). From Hotz' presentation (https://youtu.be/AerjS7PTNYs?t=7m24s) they are using existing radar and *their own* camera contained in the kit. » reply Corrected the wording for you Submitted by brad on Sun, 2016-09-18 15:00. Since the “it” in the clause is the Comma One. Obviously there is no camera in the radar. There are cameras in these cars, and in theory a tool could use them if you could get on their bus and they output the video, but Comma wants a better performance camera. » reply echolocation Submitted by Dave Brown (not verified) on Wed, 2016-09-21 19:00. Any idea if echolocation might be a viable alternative? Bats seem to navigate well with it. » reply Quite common Submitted by brad on Thu, 2016-09-22 10:08. A large fraction of cars today come with ultrasonic sensors, which are very inexpensive. They are generally only quite short range, so they are used primarily in parking and low speed operations. Even if you could use sound long range, it only goes about one foot per ms, so something 100’ away would not ping back until 200ms, which is kinda long. » reply Bats Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Fri, 2016-09-23 07:02. Bats don't move at 100 mph, even the fastest bats don't reach 100 km/h(62.5 mph) and they move through open air with their top speed(which very much unlike car traffic), while around obstacles they move much slower. Sound doesn't travel that fast, especially when compared to EM radiation like light and radar waves, which move approximately a million times faster and the current ultrasonic sensors on cars have a very limited range, they're good for detecting a car in an adjacent lane, but not one moving towards you. » reply CPU & GPU upgrades Submitted by GMcK (not verified) on Thu, 2016-10-06 20:47. With all this activity on custom ASICs, neural network chips and the like, it'll be interesting to see if any car manufacturer decides to take the next step beyond over the air software updates and put upgradable driving computers in their cars. I've upgraded the RAM and hard drive on almost every PC I've ever owned, and I bought my latest PC with the explicit intention to have a GPU upgrade as an option. But then there's my phone without even a microSD card for upgrades... If car manufacturers stay with the "no upgrades possible" path that they're currently on, it'll be another reason to never buy another car, and either lease and get annual upgrades with next year's model, or go on-demand and get continual upgrades, as long as there's enough competition or regulation to keep the fleet's capability current in the face of cost-cutting pressures. Pricing tiers that would make you decide on a ride by ride basis when to pay extra for a smarter vehicle would be no fun. » reply Comment viewing options Flat list - collapsedFlat list - expandedThreaded list - collapsedThreaded list - expanded Date - newest firstDate - oldest first 10 comments per page30 comments per page50 comments per page70 comments per page90 comments per page150 comments per page200 comments per page250 comments per page300 comments per page Select your preferred way to display the comments and click "Save settings" to activate your changes.

The biggest medical breakthroughs in future will not just happen in laboratories and they will certainly no more be a result of some chance discoveries. Almost every breakthrough that happens will have its foundation built on Data Science & Analytics. With its potential of large-scale outcome analysis, pattern recognition & future prediction - data analytics is winning over intuition and judgmental faculties at an increasing rate, seeking an ideal avenue to facilitate decision optimization. Data Science & Analytics are integral components of Internet of Things (IoT) - gearing up to bring robust technology & agile platforms in the market and creating highly attractive opportunities for the healthcare sector. According to a recent research by MarketResearch.com, the IoT market, just in the healthcare segment is poised to hit $117 billion by 2020 with a CAGR of more than 30%. IoTization - Redefining Boundaries of Healthcare Healthcare today is undergoing a radical shift with increasing play of wider ecosystem involving data scientists, aggregators, technology giants & device manufacturers. The future of healthcare will be marked by an ecosystem that will essentially evolve from isolated smart systems to system–of–systems connecting patients, devices & hospitals - with IoT being at the core of this transformation. Smartphones, wearables and other medical devices are increasingly being seen as a replacement for traditional pedometers, Sphygmomanometers (blood pressure monitor), glucometers & calorie counters, and are soon expected to find a significant place in a physician’s diagnostic toolbox. The evolving ecosystem and landscape of connected devices will expand the ability of healthcare providers to customize the treatment for patients, enabling better ways to predict, prevent and cure, improving the longevity of life. IoT – The New Resident Doctor Remote Patient Monitoring solutions and Disease Management Platforms will facilitate better Care Coordination across the Care Continuum by connecting patients with their Physicians and Caregivers in a more effective way. For instance, Intel has collaborated with Michael J. Fox Foundation to improve monitoring and treatment of Parkinson's disease, wherein they are developing a connected platform to detect patients’ patterns, collected through wearable technologies, and monitor symptoms that otherwise go unnoticed during diagnosis. Such integration of technology and analytics is leading to disruption in healthcare industry. IoTization of these solutions will also have the potential to give the Bio–Pharmaceuticals sector ability to disrupt the current ‘old school’ clinical research model with simplified and adaptive Clinical Trial design and implementation of a more patient centric drug development program. IoT enabled remote diagnosis and health checkups can eliminate the need to move patients with chronic illnesses to care homes. For instance, the percentage of people above 60 years of age is expected to rise from 11% to 15% between 2010 and 2020 and close to a billion population suffering from chronic illnesses requires continuous monitoring. Predictive models, along with the insights gleaned from healthcare IoTization, will facilitate the bedbound residents with self-monitoring of their health parameters. Businesses will be able to automate their processes, improve efficiencies and bring the providers closer to the patients by enabling real-time patient access, thus solving some of the biggest challenges in healthcare industry today - time and accessibility. Unprecedented Business Opportunities Empowered by the market need and evolving potential of IoT, new business avenues are being generated for service players to build & deploy smarter platforms in the ecosystem. New Services, along with technology integration are redefining the business model of the healthcare. Businesses will compete on their ability to deliver quantifiable end results in real time and it’s the end result that will begin to command a fee. For instance, Obama care mandates fee-for-outcome per patient where single payment is paid to the hospital for a defined episode of care. All this will require much more automation, better predictability and greater collaboration in healthcare ecosystem to offer a reduced cost of service. Service providers have huge opportunity to ride this technological shift with some of the primary use cases being: • Supply chain optimization: According to Cardinal Health, about $5Bn of medical waste is generated annually owing to ineffective inventory and supply chain tracking. Real-time monitoring & tracking could trigger alerts for automatic replenishment of supplies limiting the costs with increased efficiency • Reduced machine downtime: The average downtime cost for a healthcare related outage per incident is about $690K. According to a McKinsey study, there is potential to save upto $2.5 trillion annually by 2025 on account of the industrial IoT • Reduced turnaround time with process automation:  Continuous tracking of patients’ health through remote monitoring can reduce mortality rates by about 45% and on average firms have potential to realize upto 89% reduction in turnaround time owing to improved connectivity and process automation IoT adoption lies at the core of all these humungous business benefits which will have a direct impact on both top line and bottom line. For instance: at HCL ‘IoT Works’ - we are already witnessing significant increase in traction with our customers, for building solutions in these use cases. With one of the leading partners – just developing a gateway between client’s sterilization and verification devices helped improve device uptime by 27%, reduced field visit costs by 18%, and eliminated manual data reconciliation, ultimately leading to a significant improvement in equipment sales. The time to act is now! The emergence of the new IoTized healthcare ecosystem, with IoT being the glue binding the parts together poses a set of opportunities as well as challenges. Efficiencies and experiences will improve manifold, while we will become more vulnerable to security and privacy threats with increasingly sensitive data being generated and getting accessible. This double edged sword of IoTized Healthcare is sure to swing its way to prominence in the years to come; the difference between having the edge and being edged out boils down to how well organizations understand IoT and start acting towards building a strategy today.

Coverage of Disruptive Science and Technology Forum About Contact Facebook twitter Google October 06, 2016 Major breakthrough in transistor size by creating gate only 1 nanometer long computers, materials, nanometer, physics, science, technology Facebook Twitter linkedin google Reddit For more than a decade, engineers have been eyeing the finish line in the race to shrink the size of components in integrated circuits. They knew that the laws of physics had set a 5-nanometer threshold on the size of transistor gates among conventional semiconductors, about one-quarter the size of high-end 20-nanometer-gate transistors now on the market. Some laws are made to be broken, or at least challenged. Schematic of a transistor with a molybdenum disulfide channel and 1-nanometer carbon nanotube gate. (Credit: Sujay Desai/UC Berkeley) Transmission electron microscope image of a cross section of the transistor. It shows the 1-nanometer carbon nanotube gate and the molybdenum disulfide semiconductor separated by zirconium dioxide, an insulator. (Credit: Qingxiao Wang/UT Dallas) Science - MoS2 transistors with 1-nanometer gate lengths A research team led by faculty scientist Ali Javey at the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) has done just that by creating a transistor with a working 1-nanometer gate. For comparison, a strand of human hair is about 50,000 nanometers thick. “We made the smallest transistor reported to date,” said Javey, lead principal investigator of the Electronic Materials program in Berkeley Lab’s Materials Science Division. “The gate length is considered a defining dimension of the transistor. We demonstrated a 1-nanometer-gate transistor, showing that with the choice of proper materials, there is a lot more room to shrink our electronics.” The key was to use carbon nanotubes and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), an engine lubricant commonly sold in auto parts shops. MoS2 is part of a family of materials with immense potential for applications in LEDs, lasers, nanoscale transistors, solar cells, and more. The findings were published today in the journal Science. Other investigators on this paper include Jeff Bokor, a faculty senior scientist at Berkeley Lab and a professor at UC Berkeley; Chenming Hu, a professor at UC Berkeley; Moon Kim, a professor at the University of Texas at Dallas; and H.S. Philip Wong, a professor at Stanford University. The development could be key to keeping alive Intel co-founder Gordon Moore’s prediction that the density of transistors on integrated circuits would double every two years, enabling the increased performance of our laptops, mobile phones, televisions, and other electronics. “The semiconductor industry has long assumed that any gate below 5 nanometers wouldn’t work, so anything below that was not even considered,” said study lead author Sujay Desai, a graduate student in Javey’s lab. “This research shows that sub-5-nanometer gates should not be discounted. Industry has been squeezing every last bit of capability out of silicon. By changing the material from silicon to MoS2, we can make a transistor with a gate that is just 1 nanometer in length, and operate it like a switch.” When ‘electrons are out of control’ Transistors consist of three terminals: a source, a drain, and a gate. Current flows from the source to the drain, and that flow is controlled by the gate, which switches on and off in response to the voltage applied. Both silicon and MoS2 have a crystalline lattice structure, but electrons flowing through silicon are lighter and encounter less resistance compared with MoS2. That is a boon when the gate is 5 nanometers or longer. But below that length, a quantum mechanical phenomenon called tunneling kicks in, and the gate barrier is no longer able to keep the electrons from barging through from the source to the drain terminals. “This means we can’t turn off the transistors,” said Desai. “The electrons are out of control.” Because electrons flowing through MoS2 are heavier, their flow can be controlled with smaller gate lengths. MoS2 can also be scaled down to atomically thin sheets, about 0.65 nanometers thick, with a lower dielectric constant, a measure reflecting the ability of a material to store energy in an electric field. Both of these properties, in addition to the mass of the electron, help improve the control of the flow of current inside the transistor when the gate length is reduced to 1 nanometer. Once they settled on MoS2 as the semiconductor material, it was time to construct the gate. Making a 1-nanometer structure, it turns out, is no small feat. Conventional lithography techniques don’t work well at that scale, so the researchers turned to carbon nanotubes, hollow cylindrical tubes with diameters as small as 1 nanometer. They then measured the electrical properties of the devices to show that the MoS2 transistor with the carbon-nanotube gate effectively controlled the flow of electrons. “This work demonstrated the shortest transistor ever,” said Javey, who is also a UC Berkeley professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences. “However, it’s a proof of concept. We have not yet packed these transistors onto a chip, and we haven’t done this billions of times over. We also have not developed self-aligned fabrication schemes for reducing parasitic resistances in the device. But this work is important to show that we are no longer limited to a 5-nanometer gate for our transistors. Moore’s Law can continue a while longer by proper engineering of the semiconductor material and device architecture.” A flatter route to shorter channels High-performance silicon transistors can have gate channel lengths as short as 5 nm before source-drain tunneling and loss of electrostatic control lead to unacceptable leakage current when the device is off. Desai et al. explored the use of MoS2 as a gate material, given that its electronic properties as thin layers should limit such leakage. A transistor with a 1-nm physical gate was constructed with a MoS2 bilayer gate and a single-walled carbon nanotube gate electrode. Excellent switching characteristics and an on-off state current ratio of ∼10^6 were observed. Abstract Scaling of silicon (Si) transistors is predicted to fail below 5-nanometer (nm) gate lengths because of severe short channel effects. As an alternative to Si, certain layered semiconductors are attractive for their atomically uniform thickness down to a monolayer, lower dielectric constants, larger band gaps, and heavier carrier effective mass. Here, we demonstrate molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) transistors with a 1-nm physical gate length using a single-walled carbon nanotube as the gate electrode. These ultrashort devices exhibit excellent switching characteristics with near ideal subthreshold swing of ~65 millivolts per decade and an On/Off current ratio of ~106. Simulations show an effective channel length of ~3.9 nm in the Off state and ~1 nm in the On state.

Eliran Rubin Oct 07, 2016 3:15 AM comments Print   Zen Subscribe now  Shareshare on facebook  Tweet send via email reddit stumbleupon Artist’s rendering of Mercedes-Benz’s projected autonomous car. Opinion Self-driven Israeli car industry is heading for a crash If you would ask the average Israeli about their country’s involvement in the auto industry, they would probably sum it up with Mobileye, the auto collision avoidance and self-drive tech company, along with navigational app Waze, which was sold to Google. Those with a more historical perspective might also mention the Susita, from the country’s defunct auto industry. The global automobile industry has been centered in the United States, Germany and Japan, but as with other sectors that are being transformed by technology, Israel is becoming a powerhouse when it comes to certain aspects of the car industry. New technology is making the automotive industry smarter and more efficient, and is ultimately also headed toward the widespread production of self-driving cars. These developments have transformed an industry that used to be based primarily on sheet metal and iron into one increasingly reliant on software. In addition to the car manufacturers’ own efforts on this score, tech giants such as Google and Apple have ventured into the fray. And then there is Israel’s prominence in the field, which even in the past several months is reflected in Volkswagen’s investment of a whopping $300 million in the Israeli firm Gett (formerly Gett Taxi), as part of its effort to create a shared fleet of smart vehicles. And in July, Mobileye signed a collaboration agreement with BMW and Intel for the production of a self-driving car. In other developments, NNG, the developer of iGO navigation software, bought the Bnei Brak-based automotive cyber firm Arilou and the Israeli firm Saips, which is involved in the development of complex algorithms, was sold in August to Ford Motor for a figure estimated in the tens of millions of dollars. And the list goes on. Last month Volkswagen became a 40% partner in a new cyber security firm in which former Shin Bet security agency head Yuval Diskin is involved. As far back as 2010, General Motors spotted the potential that Israeli talent offered in the field and established a research and development center in Herzliya. Daimler Mercedes-Benz, which local industry sources say is also showing great interest in Israel, is expected to follow suit in the coming months. “There are now about 100 processors in a car and the more that [automotive] technology shifts in the direction of using software, Israel has an increasing advantage,” Yahal Zilka, a founder and partner at the Israeli firm Magma Venture Partners, which has already invested in four smart vehicle firms, tells TheMarker. “It will have an impact on all of us, and Israeli high-tech will have a substantial part in it.” There has been virtually an airlift of automotive executives who have visited Israel in recent months to meet with local companies in the field, he adds. Confusing coverage Media coverage of the future of the auto industry is a bit confusing, however, focusing primarily on self-driving car technology. Analysts at the Boston Consulting Group predict that the driverless car sector will be worth $42 billion by 2025, but in the meantime, car manufacturers and high-tech firms are talking about other transportation solutions such as the ride-sharing that Uber has made ubiquitous in some parts of the world. There are two major functions that will determine what the automotive industry of the future looks like: control and ownership, says accountant Tal Chen, a partner at Deloitte Israel. The control function involves either a human driver or automated control, and when it comes to ownership there is the dichotomy of self-ownership or shared transportation, he says. Chen cited recent comments by an auto industry executive who noted the rapid acceleration in the pace of change that the industry is expected to undergo and said the automakers want to be substantial players in this “ecosystem.” For his part, however, lawyer Itay Frishman, who heads the high-tech and venture capital group at the law firm of Gross, Kleinhendler Hodak, is more cautious. “It’s not necessarily the best startups that will be successful,” he says. “The automotive industry doesn’t want to step on its own toes. It needs technology, but it is also threatened by it, so success is dependent on whom the major corporations will be comfortable working with.” Most of the deals, he says, are cooperative ventures, which is different from how most startups work. The process is slower and startups need to have patience, he adds. Another challenge for startups in the field is regulation, Frishman notes, explaining that it is a new field presenting unfamiliar issues such as liability regarding self-driving cars. The main technology fields related to the car industry include the development of various kinds of chips; communications; big data and analytics; artificial intelligence; and above it all, there is the looming threat of cyber attacks. And there is also the challenge in the development of self-driving cars of integrating the range of technology so that the various features communicate with one another, making the journey safer and more comfortable. For his part, Zilka says all of these fields are ones that Israel has particular expertise in thanks to Israeli academics and the defense industries. “Everyone has noted that we have special talents here, and I am not just talking about cyber security. Back in the 1990s, Israel was a communications powerhouse and Israel is a leader in the radar field as well.” The expertise that Israel has in a number of fields also applies to the automotive sector, he adds. Valens’ accidental connection One of the more interesting Israeli high-tech stories, which is related to the car industry almost by happenstance, involves the Hod Hasharon-based company Valens, which is now considered an influential force when it comes to cars of the future. Established in 2006 by six people, all of whom are still with the company, Valens develops chips based on technology called HDBaseT, which provides connectivity using Ethernet cables among various video products. It’s used mainly for conference rooms, conferences and public facilities such as shopping malls and airports. Valens CEO Dror Yerushalmi explains that his company’s technology has allowed for the use of one cable instead of a multiplicity of lines. The company has managed to establish the industry standard. Last year it won the television Emmy award in the United States in the field of technology, along with other recipients including HBO, Netflix and DirectTV. Along the way, however, about two years ago, Valens was surprised to attract the attention of senior executives of a major auto manufacturer that Valens asked not be named. The automaker realized that the audio-visual technology that was Valens’ mainstay would be a nearly critical component for high-tech vehicles and self-driving cars. Magma Venture Capital’s Zilka says the industry recognized the problem presented by the increase in data that needed to be handled in the vehicles, but explains that cables can be heavy, which is a major concern for the industry. Yerushalmi, of Valens, says the ability to carry a number of streams of data in one cable therefore becomes all that more important. Although the quantity of cables is small in most cars now, the more that accessories such as cameras, sensors and data processors are added to the vehicle, the more light-weight cables will be required. TheMarker’s interview at Valens was cut short by a group of senior executives from a German technology firm that was interested in Valens’ knowhow. Mobileye was the pioneer The Israeli company considered the pioneer on a global scale in the automotive sector and which in many respects has promoted Israel’s prowess in the field, along with Waze, is Mobileye. The Jerusalem-based company developed a system based on artificial intelligence that includes a camera and computer vision capabilities to prevent accidents. It knows when a driver drifts out of lane or gets too close to another vehicle or a pedestrian and can also sense rapid acceleration or deceleration. Now in addition, it is considered a leader in efforts to develop self-driving cars, or autonomous cars as they are sometimes called. The company is publicly traded at a market value of $9.5 billion and has collaborative relations with major car manufacturers including Audi, BMW, Tesla Motors, General Motors, Hyundai, Renault-Nissan and Volvo. In addition to Mobileye’s camera-based technology, there is a need for radar and laser technology to improve visibility at night and in fog. Innoviz is a young Israeli startup in the field that is developing sensors and visual processors for use in self-driving vehicles in conditions of difficult visibility. The company is developing a laser sensor that is being used by Google in its autonomous vehicle project, providing a detailed, three-dimensional picture of the car’s surroundings. Founded this year, Innoviz raised $9 million a few months ago. Another aspect of self-driving car technology involves what is called V2V or vehicle-to-vehicle communications. The field includes two Israeli companies, Otonomo and AutoTalks, which compete with chipmaker NXP. Founded in 2008, Otonomo develops technology related to radio communications among vehicles, with the aim of creating a system in which each vehicle broadcasts its location along with other data on its movement, including its velocity or use of its steering wheel or brakes. But the connectivity technology in highly sophisticated cars also raises the prospect that hackers could break into various systems. Israel is considered a leader in the field of information security and a number of entrepreneurs have already spotted the potential that the automotive field offers. In fact, five of the eight automotive cyber security companies worldwide are Israeli. The first in Israel was Arilou, in which Israeli firm NNG recently acquired a 60% stake for $10 million. In addition, in January, the global car entertainment systems company Harman International bought another Israeli firm, TowerSec, for $70 million. And just weeks ago, Diskin announced the creation of his new company in the field, CyMotiv, which he established with two partners in cooperation with Volkswagen, which has a 40% stake in the firm. The company, Diskin said, will without question be run from Israel.

This has created opportunity in that market that Hewlett-Packard is consciously exploiting. The Best Surprise is No Surprise Apple keeps secrets for good reason. The PC market remains very competitive, and there are several companies who have been emulating Apple’s designs and coveting Apple’s image and success in the notebook market. Apple has a history of developing breakthrough designs that leave the competition gasping. But they’ve been catching up. HP ZBook. 120 sent to NASA’s space station. Runs Linux. That said, the enterprise and technical markets do need some occasional care and feeding when it comes to professional, mission critical equipment. Just as Apple’s product cycle can get out of sync with Intel’s, technical professionals engaged in design, research and computation need to depend on a long-term vision from their favorite computer supplier. Over the past few years, signs of inattention to these markets have emerged from Cupertino. All this has been documented elsewhere, so I won’t rehash it in detail except to point to the long-awaited 2013 Mac Pro, Apple’s grand opening fanfare and then its subsequent abandonment: 1,000+ days of silence. The demise of apple.com/science and the absent attention to the eventually terminated, obsolete Thunderbolt display and the end of support for Aperture sent unmistakable messages that weren’t explained or remedied by new initiatives. Hewlett-Packard Has Noticed HP has had its ups and downs in recent years, but it remains a strong engineering company that caters to technical professionals. HP has a storied tradition in everything for technical professionals from handheld calculators to measurement and instrumentation to UNIX workstations to supercomputers. Along the way, I have become aware of certain initiatives by Hewlett-Packard and have engaged the company in conversation about its initiatives. Perhaps the most visible sign so far was my long odyssey, looking for a new display for my Mac Pro culminating in a review of HP’s magnificent Z34c 34-inch display. See: “The Display You’ve Always Wanted For Your Mac: HP Z34c.” HP’s amazing Z34c curved display. (3440 x 1440) Further discussions have resulted in an affirmation that HP both recognizes the opportunity created by Apple and is eager to exploit it. My HP representative provided some insight. Note that the following statement may seem like market-speak, but that’s not the point. The point is that HP is hereby punctuating its interest in catering to technical professionals who feel abandoned by Apple, rightly or wrongly. HP’s Z Family of professional workstation-class products is focused on meeting the needs of the world’s most demanding users. HP has a heritage of engineering excellence, and has been delighting customers with workstations innovations for more than 35 years. Today, HP Z Desktop Workstations, ZBook Mobile Workstations, and Z Displays are used to design everything from running shoes and racecars to animated characters and deep-sea submersibles, as well as to manage research labs, mission-critical IT environments and billions of dollars of tradable securities. HP Z products are designed to meet the needs of some of the most compute-intensive industries, including animation, film/video editing, graphic design, CAD, architecture, photography, high-definition video, manufacturing, finance, healthcare, scientific imaging and oil and gas exploration. At the beginning of the century, four key players manufactured traditional workstations: Silicon Graphics, Sun, IBM and HP. Today, HP is the only surviving and thriving workstation vendor of those four. In just a few short years, HP went from a distant second in the market to No. 1 in workstation shipments worldwide. In support of this initiative, HP has developed, if you will, a reverse switcher site, called Mac to Z. Looking at that page’s comparison chart to a Mac Pro, it’s clear why a workstation like this has technical appeal. Imagine 36 cores and 2 TB of RAM. Next page: computing religion and the Mac’s future. Pages: 1 2 Next Page Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit Tags: Apple, HP, Macs 5 Comments Add a comment geoduck October 6, 2016 I just went out to the HP site and configured a Z laptop the way I would a MacBook Pro. It was a bit less in price, by no more than a couple of hundred though. BUT it was a better unit than Apple sells now. I could get a basic unit that I could work with for a couple of years foir a LOT less. Mind you I got it with FreeDOS rather than Win10 which helped the price a bit. I’d nuke and pave it with Linux anyway. But the point is Apple had better knock my socks off. The competition is making a VERY solid case for switching. That is ASSUMING they actually release a new MBP this year. I’m still not getting much buzz about that. Yes a lot of sites are speculating but no hardware photo leaks. No notes from anonymous Apple staff about vacation blackout periods. No rumors from FedEx about big shipments from Apple sitting in warehouses. No leaks of preparations or reservations for venues. Other then sites saying “Yes they always have a Mac event in October” it’s been nothing. Nothing hard. Nothing even squishy but believable. Sites are still nursing the “thinner with an OLED function key row” stories from months ago. The silence is deafening. Today is the 6th. Factor in a 2 week heads up about an upcoming event and that puts you in mid to latter half of the month. The window is closing for the Christmas rush. As my dad would say they need to S or get off the P. October 6, 2016 at 7:33 EST PM MarcusNewton October 7, 2016 The HP workstations are nice options. For me, I like how many different configurations options there are to choose from. Unlike the 1000 day old Mac Pro, I can pick something middle of the road and still add and upgrade things later. Sure the two graphics cards included in the Mac Pro were a good deal at the time it was released, but now a single Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 is more powerful then two D500s. (Based on the D500 having 2.2 teraflops each for a combined 4.4 teraflops, and the solo Nvidia 1080 having 8.2 teraflops floating-point performance). Also, a single GeForce 1080 has a retail price of $599. Yes, I know there is a difference between gaming graphics cards and workstation graphics cards, but the 1080 is so powerful it is easily a poor-mans workstation card. I could take a basic HP 440 workstation with a 1080 graphics card and be totally happy with my budget $1,600 workstation instead of a $2,999 Mac Pro I cannot upgrade and has a single internal hard drive. On the other hand, I think Apple knows that my distaste for Windows will keep me from buying a PC workstation no matter how much I may drool over the options, customization choices, and easily swappable PC hardware. I have tried Blender on Linux, and it works really well, but there is just not enough of other things for me to switch full time. Even though I am hopeful that Apple will fall in love with Macs again, and release a Mac Pro that can compete against the HP workstations, I also fear that minimalism and gimmicks will overrun anything actually useful. I have this reoccurring nightmare that the next Mac Pro double-downs on compactness, and ends up looking like a rounded Sony Playstation. October 7, 2016 at 12:11 EST AM geoduck October 7, 2016 MarcusNewton I use my MacBook for writing, some art, and editing YouTube Videos. For me Linux with OpenOffice, Blender, and Gimp would do most of what I want. Switch to DropBox over iCloud and I’d have nearly everything I need. No, it wouldn’t be as seamlessly integrated as the macOS/iOS ecosystem. There would be a bit of kludgyness. But full function with a bit of awkwardness at a huge savings is tempting. October 7, 2016 at 9:38 EST AM DaveNull October 7, 2016 I’ve been using primarily Macs since the IIci, so I’m not exactly one to switch platforms lightly. But I just made the jump from a MacBook Pro to a PC mobile workstation (albeit a ThinkPad, not a ZBook). These days, Apple makes computers for the masses: *Most* of their users don’t care if the computer has an ethernet port; *most* of them don’t care if there are more than two USB ports; *most* of them don’t care that the RAM is soldered on and the battery glued in; and *most* of them don’t care (or know) that their computer throttles when the CPU cores are pegged. And that’s fine. Different users have different needs. What’s disappointing is that despite its vast financial resources, Apple no longer makes a professional computer for those of us who *do* care about these things. Plenty of companies make “halo” products that aren’t meant to sold to the majority of their customers, but the richest company in the world doesn’t. (Okay, you got me. I forgot about $10K Apple Watches.) Fortunately, I’m finding both Windows and Ubuntu to be more viable alternatives than they once were. I’ll continue to buy Apple’s iToys, because they still make the best gadgets. But as far as I’m concerned, Apple no longer makes the best tools for getting work done. So long, Macintosh, and thanks for the memories. October 7, 2016 at 12:43 EST PM khurt October 9, 2016 The MacBook has one USB-C port for connectivity and power. The target demographic for that computer is fine with the speed of wireless, the iWork Suite, mail and calendar and the Safari browser. For the user base portability is the important feature. The professional user, however, needs speed (Ethernet, memory, CPU, GPU) , access to large amount of external storage and the flexibility of connecting to a large existing base of peripherals — professional audio gear, video and photography gear, displays. These peripherals are expensive and often support older standards — USB, FireWire, HDMI, DVI, VGA. For a professional the most important feature is flexibility. They expect a professional machine to have ports. They don’t want to carry a stack of adapters to add back lost functionality. To use a MacBook as a professional computer I would need a USB-C adapter for HDMI, and VGA and DVI. I would need to connect several external storage devices including thunderbolt, FireWire and USB. For high speed acces to network attached storage I would rather have Ethernet than wireless. October 9, 2016 at 11:28 EST AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Creative Commons Attribution Linux Foundation / Photo: David A Johanson BigPicturePhoto© For many years AT&T has been on the forefront of virtualizing a Tier 1 carrier network. They’ve done so in a very open fashion and are actively participating in, and driving, many open sources initiatives.  Their open initiatives include Domain 2.0, ECOMP, and CORD, all of which are driving innovation in the global service provider market.  Chris Rice, Sr. VP of Domain 2.0 Architecture and Design of AT&T, provided an overview of how AT&T got where they are today during his keynote address at the ODL Summit. Providing a bit of history of this journey, Rice noted that today’s implementations and visions started years ago. One of the first steps was the creation of what he called a router farm, which was initiated because of the end of life of a router and there wasn’t a new router that could just take its place. The goal was to remove the static relationship between the edge router and the customer. Once this was done, AT&T could provide better resiliency to their customers, detect failures, do planned maintenance, and schedule backups. They could also move configurations from one router to another vendor’s router.   The result was faster and cheaper; however, “it just wasn’t as reusable as they wanted.” They learned the importance of separating services from the network and from the devices. About three and a half  years ago, the greater community and ecosystem started to address many of the company’s key concerns. For example, Rice noted that Intel was continuing to improve the packet processing performance of their general purpose CPUs, resulting in a 100 times improvement over a 10-year period. What they concluded was that “next-generation carrier networks must be: cloud-based, model-driven, and software defined.” He acknowledged that today this might not sound exciting but three and a half years ago, it was insightful.    ECOMP and VNF During this time ECOMP (Enhanced Control, Orchestration, Management and Policy) was born.  Rice noted that ECOMP is “not a science project.”  It was fully vetted and has been used in production networks for the past 2 years. Today, ECOMP comprises more than 8.5 million lines of code and is growing every day.  Rice also noted that currently 5.7 percent of AT&T’s network is virtualized and the goal is for 30 percent to be virtualized by the end of 2016.   The Layer 2/3 SDN controller within ECOMP is based on ODL and includes a Layer 4-7 VNF management and application controller. Rice noted that a key takeaway was that ODL can be used at all layers of the OSI Stack. The layer 4-7 application controller is used to initialize and configure virtual network functions (VNFs), automate the lifecycle of VNFs, and to correct and monitor faults and failures of application components. He pointed out that all of this is being achieved in a vendor and VNF agnostic mechanism. Legos Not Snowflakes Perhaps the biggest takeaway from Rice’s keynote was his comment that today’s VNFs are “snowflakes and we want Lego blocks not snowflakes.” Lego blocks come in different shapes and colors yet they all interoperate. And, if each VNF is unique, it requires a costly and time consuming “one off” integration effort.  With the Lego model, they can build a framework or a foundation once and add or replace interoperable VNFs as required.   There are functions that all VNFs must support regardless of their specific functionality. Rice noted that AT&T must be able to configure, test, scale, start, stop, restart, and rebuild every VNF no matter what its specific function. The industry as a whole, he continued, must work to normalize VNFs to support the common operational framework, the Lego model.  To illustrate their success in this model, Rice discussed their work with the optical transport part of their network. Using their methodology, AT&T has achieved end-to-end multi-vendor interoperability and can configuring and reconfiguring multiple vendors ROADMs. Rice finished his talk by highlighting “why ODL.” First, ODL controllers are platforms for innovation. The   innovation occurs in both the way networks are built and in the way services are designed. Second, programmable controllers, such as within ODL, must support a rich set of both Northbound/Southbound interfaces as well as East/West capabilities. Rice noted here that the support for what he referred to as “brownfield” protocols is a mandatory requirement. Third, Rice called on the ODL community to focus on reliability and on scale and specifically called out the need for geographical redundancy.

Here's a round up of the biggest news. Oculus working on standalone VR headset to sit between Rift and Gear VR Oculus Touch ships December 6 for $199, new Touch-based experiences debuted New sensor gives Rift Vive-like room-scale tracking Oculus brought the Rift more into line with the HTC Vive thanks to the addition of room-scale tracking technology, meaning users will be able to move around within their environment. The $79 sensor pairs with the additional sensor bundled with the $200 Oculus Touch controllers, which will finally ship on December 6. The room-scaling support is only possible by combining the Rift, Touch and the additional sensor. The result will be that Rift owners will be able to move around in real life and see those movements reflected in the virtual world. The sensor will also be available on December 6. Best find a new home for that sofa, coffee table and cat, folks. Rift will work with $500 PC Oculus is also lowering the barrier to high-end VR, by announcing the Rift will soon provide great experiences with much-less powerful PCs, including laptops. While you currently need a PC worth around $1,000 to ensure a great VR experience, Oculus’ engineering advancements will make it possible with a PC worth around half that price. From today, a PC with the minimum spec of Nvidia 960 graphics card and an Intel i3-6100/AMD FX4350 CPU will be able to run the Rift. The new minimum spec requires 8GB of RAM. To achieve this Oculus is using two new systems, dubbed Spacewarp and Timewarp. The latter will add new ‘synthetic’ frames into the picture if your hardware is dropping them and the former lowers the demands on your hardware. As a result Rift experiences will run at 45fps, rather than the recommended 90fps, but these gap-filling measures should be enough to ensure a smooth experience that prevents nausea. New buds Oculus has announced new in-ear headphones for $49 that will ship in December, allowing users to replace the bundled-in on-ear audio accessory. Oculus is bringing VR to the web Oculus is working on a brand new web browser for its Rift headset which currently exists under the codename Carmel. However, it won’t just be for piddling around on Facebook, Oculus also announced a new ReactVR platform that will enable web-based VR (WebVR) experiences. The duo will enable developers to create VR experiences that can be streamed from the web rather than downloaded to the device from a store, making it easy for people to experience new content. The developer previews will be available soon. Get social with Avatars, Parties and Rooms When Facebook purchased Oculus, you imagine this is what they had in mind. Our very own Avatars hanging out and having Parties or simply meeting up to chat in Rooms. The new Avatars feature will make up your VR identity and it’ll be how others see you in the VR world. Effectively it’s an outline of your face that’s been customised with various accessories. Once you have your Avatar you can go hang out in virtual chat rooms with friends where everyone can play games like chess or watch movies together. Parties allows up to 8 people to group chat at the same time. (Image credit: Engadget) Oculus will have Blade Runner 2049 and Disney experiences We don’t know how yet, but the long-awaited Blade Runner sequel Blade Runner 2049 is coming to the Oculus Rift in some capacity (main image). Oculus also announced there’ll be some experiences involving classic Disney characters available for both Rift and Gear VR. “We are incredibly pleased to announce a collaboration with Walt Disney Studios, one of the most recognizable names in storytelling,” Oculus content producer Yelena Rachitsky said. “We’re going to be working with Disney to create a series of experiences based on their most beloved characters.” Game streaming for Gear VR Those rocking a Samsung Gear VR will be able to stream their experiences to Facebook Live. No new Gear VR controller announced, but Oculus did say it was committing $50m to mobile VR this year. In terms of new Gear VR experiences, there'll be Singspace, a karaoke game from Harmonix to look forward to in 2017, where you can hang out with friends and strangers in virtual bars and sing. Palmer Luckey was MIA The Oculus founder skipped the event to avoid being distraction, according to Oculus.

Berkeley Lab-led research breaks major barrier in transistor size by creating gate only 1-nanometer long DOE/Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Share  Print  E-Mail IMAGE: This is a schematic of a transistor with a molybdenum disulfide channel and 1-nanometer carbon nanotube gate. view more Credit: Sujay Desai/Berkeley Lab For more than a decade, engineers have been eyeing the finish line in the race to shrink the size of components in integrated circuits. They knew that the laws of physics had set a 5-nanometer threshold on the size of transistor gates among conventional semiconductors, about one-quarter the size of high-end 20-nanometer-gate transistors now on the market. Some laws are made to be broken, or at least challenged. A research team led by faculty scientist Ali Javey at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) has done just that by creating a transistor with a working 1-nanometer gate. For comparison, a strand of human hair is about 50,000 nanometers thick. "We made the smallest transistor reported to date," said Javey, a lead principal investigator of the Electronic Materials program in Berkeley Lab's Materials Science Division. "The gate length is considered a defining dimension of the transistor. We demonstrated a 1-nanometer-gate transistor, showing that with the choice of proper materials, there is a lot more room to shrink our electronics." The key was to use carbon nanotubes and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), an engine lubricant commonly sold in auto parts shops. MoS2 is part of a family of materials with immense potential for applications in LEDs, lasers, nanoscale transistors, solar cells, and more. The findings will appear in the Oct. 7 issue of the journal Science. Other investigators on this paper include Jeff Bokor, a faculty senior scientist at Berkeley Lab and a professor at UC Berkeley; Chenming Hu, a professor at UC Berkeley; Moon Kim, a professor at the University of Texas at Dallas; and H.S. Philip Wong, a professor at Stanford University. The development could be key to keeping alive Intel co-founder Gordon Moore's prediction that the density of transistors on integrated circuits would double every two years, enabling the increased performance of our laptops, mobile phones, televisions, and other electronics. "The semiconductor industry has long assumed that any gate below 5 nanometers wouldn't work, so anything below that was not even considered," said study lead author Sujay Desai, a graduate student in Javey's lab. "This research shows that sub-5-nanometer gates should not be discounted. Industry has been squeezing every last bit of capability out of silicon. By changing the material from silicon to MoS2, we can make a transistor with a gate that is just 1 nanometer in length, and operate it like a switch." When 'electrons are out of control' Transistors consist of three terminals: a source, a drain, and a gate. Current flows from the source to the drain, and that flow is controlled by the gate, which switches on and off in response to the voltage applied. Both silicon and MoS2 have a crystalline lattice structure, but electrons flowing through silicon are lighter and encounter less resistance compared with MoS2. That is a boon when the gate is 5 nanometers or longer. But below that length, a quantum mechanical phenomenon called tunneling kicks in, and the gate barrier is no longer able to keep the electrons from barging through from the source to the drain terminals. "This means we can't turn off the transistors," said Desai. "The electrons are out of control." Because electrons flowing through MoS2 are heavier, their flow can be controlled with smaller gate lengths. MoS2 can also be scaled down to atomically thin sheets, about 0.65 nanometers thick, with a lower dielectric constant, a measure reflecting the ability of a material to store energy in an electric field. Both of these properties, in addition to the mass of the electron, help improve the control of the flow of current inside the transistor when the gate length is reduced to 1 nanometer. Once they settled on MoS2 as the semiconductor material, it was time to construct the gate. Making a 1-nanometer structure, it turns out, is no small feat. Conventional lithography techniques don't work well at that scale, so the researchers turned to carbon nanotubes, hollow cylindrical tubes with diameters as small as 1 nanometer. They then measured the electrical properties of the devices to show that the MoS2 transistor with the carbon nanotube gate effectively controlled the flow of electrons. "This work demonstrated the shortest transistor ever," said Javey, who is also a UC Berkeley professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences. "However, it's a proof of concept. We have not yet packed these transistors onto a chip, and we haven't done this billions of times over. We also have not developed self-aligned fabrication schemes for reducing parasitic resistances in the device. But this work is important to show that we are no longer limited to a 5-nanometer gate for our transistors. Moore's Law can continue a while longer by proper engineering of the semiconductor material and device architecture." ### The work at Berkeley Lab was primarily funded by the Department of Energy's Basic Energy Sciences program.

Thanks, TC Team Disrupt LondonCo-founder Of DeepMind, Mustafa Suleyman, To Speak At Disrupt London Save £250 On Tickets Now You can now run the Oculus Rift on a $500 PC Posted Oct 6, 2016 by Lucas Matney (@lucas_matney) 0 SHARES Next Story Prisma adds art filtered video, GIFs coming next VR has been pretty expensive to get going with, but it’s slowly getting cheaper. Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe announced some changes to the minimum PC spec requirements required for Rift at the company’s developers conference, a move that will likely open up the platform to a much wider audience. Now, a PC with an Nvidia 960 graphics card and an Intel i3-6100 CPU will be able to support the Rift. Iribe notably highlighted that AMD has made a desktop for $499 that meets these requirements (with an AMD processor obviously). Iribe also teased that a number of laptop computers will be integrated into the Oculus-ready certification. The reason for the lowered spec requirements is an oddly-named feature called Asynchronous Spacewarp (???) which lets content operate at an internal 45 frames per second while being smoothly beamed to the Rift headset at 90fps. The system works by taking a pair of frames and creating a synthetic frames in between them that makes up for their differences. It’s definitely not as ideal as native 90 frame rendering but it does effectively open the Rift headset to lower specced PCs. It will be interesting to see how Oculus uses features like this to optimize the Rift for different systems. The Rift is likely going to find a home on the Project Scorpio Xbox One next year and tech similar to this may help the company optimize experiences for lower-powered consoles. PC-centric virtual reality is still pretty unwieldy for the average consumer, but as Oculus relaxes the minimum specs it slowly grows more likely that they can get onto the platform without too much investment. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe Latest Crunch Report Facebook's Fake News Problem | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Popular Posts Featured Stories June Intelligent Oven Review VIDEO | 4:50 | Reviews This is why Snapchat didn’t give Spectacles to techies 7 hours ago | Josh Constine Chinese scientists CRISPR a human for the first time 8 hours ago | Sarah Buhr Snapchat has reportedly filed confidentially for its massive IPO 10 hours ago | Matthew Lynley DJI’s Inspire 2 gets a second camera for first-person video feeds 11 hours ago | Brian Heater Latest From TechCrunch Samsung’s latest acquisition could pave the way for its own iMessage-type service 12 minutes ago | Jon Russell Former Twitter India head joins Times Internet to lead its global partnerships business 32 minutes ago | Jon Russell “Anti-smartphone” Light Phone runs into delays 2 hours ago | Haje Jan Kamps Crunch Report | Facebook’s Fake News Problem 2 hours ago | Khaled "Tito" Hamze Comment moderation powered by Up Next Prisma adds art filtered video, GIFs coming next Posted Oct 6, 2016 CrunchBoard Job Listings Director, Software Security @ Practice Fusion at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Developer at CastleBranch (Wilmington, NC, United States) Infrastructure Engineer Tango at The Sourcery (Mountain View, CA, United States) Senior Software Engineer @ Pared at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Software Engineer @ Pared at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2016 AOL Inc.

Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Oct 6, 2016 at 1:44PM Image source: Getty Images. NXP Semiconductors' (NASDAQ:NXPI) stock price history has seen a long climb over nearly seven years, and recent rumors of a possible buyout from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) (or other players) is pushing up the stock's value to close to its historical high, as you can see in the chart below.  Data source: YCharts. A recent one-day stock price pop of 22% came after The Wall Street Journal reported that Qualcomm is attempting to buy NXP Semiconductor for an undisclosed sum. That news was recently followed up by an article by Bloomberg that said NXP is considering selling itself to another company (as in, not Qualcomm) and has hired Qatalyst Partners to do so. NXP is rumored to be fielding inquiries from Avago Technologies, Intel, and Samsung. While there haven't been any details on the possible sale price, here's what NXP Semiconductors' financials look like right now:  Company Enterprise Value Trailing Revenue Trailing Free Cash Flow  NXP  $33.4 billion  $7.7 billion  $0.5 billion Data source: Yahoo! Finance.  Current fluctuations If you look at NXP's stock price over the past year (including the past few weeks), you can see how volatile it has been.  Image source: YCharts. The high points have come in part as NXP has realized its potential in areas like near-field communication (NFC) and on the success of its $12 billion purchase of Freescale Semiconductor, but the drops have come from recent headwinds from rising costs. Bloomberg noted in its article that the semiconductor is both facing a shortage of customers and an increase of component costs at the same time.  NXP is relatively small compared to the other semiconductor companies, and Qualcomm may want to use its $30 billion in cash scoop up NXP.  Qualcomm may be interested in NXP's position in the automotive space. NXP's purchase of Freescale made it the leading supplier of semiconductors to the automotive market, with 14.5% market share. Additionally, NXP launched its BlueBox autonomous driving system back in May that is designed as an off-the-shelf system that allows carmakers to design, manufacture, and sell level 4 (full autonomy) self-driving cars by 2020. The system comes with lidar, radar, and on-board vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication sensors and is open-sourced so automakers can make their own adjustments to it.  The automotive semiconductor market was worth $29 billion in 2015, according to IHS, and IDC says the market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 8% through 2020. And that, with its dominant position in the automotive space, makes NXP a valuable target right now. Where NXP's stock price goes from here It's impossible to predict NXP's future stock price, of course, but the recent uptick is likely to cool off at some point as investors get used the idea that the company may be purchased.  If a sale doesn't happen, though, I think investors are likely to experience some of the same volatility that NXP has experienced in the past. The company still has a while to go before the Freescale acquisition has been fully integrated into its current business.  While a deal may be on the horizon, NXP investors should factor in any purchase of the stock right now with the fact that the semiconductor space is getting increasingly competitive. Sales in the automotive space may help the company over the long term, but there's likely some short-term volatility ahead.  Chris Neiger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

These systems were designed specifically for high-frequency trading (HFT) applications, where sequential processing speed is critical. ICC Alpha™ servers will first be demoed at The Trading Show 2016 in New York City on October 6. ICC Alpha™ was designed from the ground up by a dedicated in-house overclocking team. The systems were uncompromisingly built for speed: pure processing power. Multiple memory kits were tested and then selected to deliver the highest bandwidth and lowest latency possible. In addition, many changes have been implemented in the BIOS, OS, and hardware for minimum jitter and maximum performance. The ICC Alpha™ is able to achieve these unparalleled speeds with the utilization of a custom cooling solution in each node, developed with the consultation of thermal engineers. ICC offers customers a fully customized solution by working with BIOS engineers to tailor ICC Alpha™ systems to the unique needs of each customer's applications. "Our HFT customers are seeking absolutely the fastest possible processing available on the market to run their financial applications," observed ICC's Director of Development Alexey Stolyar. "ICC Alpha™ allows in an unprecedented way for trading firms to stay ahead of the competition in an industry where nanoseconds could mean the difference between loss or significant profit." The ICC Alpha™ line of custom-cooled and overclocked servers includes: ICC Alpha™ R-818v3 Processor (per node): Intel® Core™ i7-5960x at 5.0 GHz (Haswell-E) Memory (per node): Up to 32 GB DDR4 at 3200 MHz ICC Alpha™ R-818v3e Processor (per node): Intel® Xeon® E5-1680v3 at 5.0 GHz (Haswell-E) Memory (per node): Up to 32 GB DDR4 at 3200 MHz/2666 MHz ECC ICC Alpha™ R-818v4 Processor (per node): Intel® Core™ i7-6950x at 4.7 GHz (Broadwell-E) Memory (per node): Up to 32 GB DDR4 at 3200 MHz Each one of these systems comes standard with 4x 2.5" SATA drive support, 2x16 PCIe 3.0 full profile slots, and a 4000 W shared power supply (208-240 V).

By sharing these trends with our readers, we hope to provide insights into what the financial world is concerned about and how to position your portfolio. This week investors have been surprised by Theresa May’s strong suggestion that her government will focus on immigration rather than business interests in the upcoming Brexit talks, negatively impacting the British pound. Elsewhere on the list, semiconductors have been boosted by Apple’s newly launched iPhone 7, while OPEC’s surprising production freeze underpinned oil prices. Finally, Amazon garnered interest for its market consolidation move, and Deutsche Bank’s woes directed attention to the Financials sector. British Pound: May’s Anti-Immigration Message Sparks Sell-off U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May strongly suggested in a recent speech that her government will push for a so-called hard Brexit, sending the British pound to 31-year lows and sparking our readers’ interest. Traffic for the currency surged as much as 413% over the past week, as bewildered investors watched May’s speech in dismay. Guggenheim’s British Pound Sterling Trust (FXB A-) dropped more than 2% since last Thursday until Wednesday’s close, extending year-to-date losses to a staggering 13.7%. May’s stance on Brexit took investors by surprise. She signaled a departure from the small government policies of her predecessor David Cameron, clearly suggesting that immigration will dominate the upcoming negotiations with the European Union. Although May said business interests are paramount to Britain’s success, she downplayed the importance of the banking sector, which is apparently closer than ever to losing its so-called passporting rights when Brexit completes. May seemingly has taken a broader message from the referendum and looks set to change course from a business-oriented government to a social one. The Prime Minister has also been reported to refuse to prioritize financial services’ interests in negotiations with the EU, setting the stage for a more dramatic post-Brexit change than previously thought by investors. Banks were quick to warn on Tuesday that about 70,000 jobs and $13 billion in taxes were at risk, if they aren’t able to sell their services across the European Union. But that message is unlikely to sway a strikingly decisive May. Semiconductors: Thanks iPhone 7 Semiconductor ETFs have seen their traffic surge as much as 70% this week, far behind the British pound. Semiconductor companies are in great demand from investors at the moment. For example, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH A-) jumped about 2.6% since last Thursday, extending year-to-date gains to as much as 30%. Semiconductor stocks have been boosted following reports by Apple (AAPL) that pre-orders for its latest product – iPhone 7 – were strong. Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), both Apple suppliers, were among the best performers. However, many stocks, including blue-chips such as Intel (INTC), have been getting a lot of interest from short sellers lately, suggesting the sector is overheating. Oil and Gas: OPEC Lends a Hand to U.S. Fracking Rivals OPEC’s surprising production cut agreement has enticed readers towards the oil and gas sector, which posted a rise in traffic of 68%. Although it was surely not intended, OPEC seems to have given a much-needed lifeline to distressed U.S. shale companies, as the subsequent rise in oil prices could give U.S. producers more confidence and make them a touch more aggressive than they had planned. A rise in rig efficiency and an unexpected $60 per barrel could embolden investors who have stayed away from oil and gas companies to finally get in the market. Those wanting to partake in a revival of the industry have SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (XOP B+) as a primary option. The ETF has risen nearly 4% over the past five days, and is up 29% since the beginning of the year. With OPEC seemingly prepared to take action, many shale plays that have become unprofitable during this bearish period will once again be open for business, leading to a corresponding bump in U.S. output. Amazon Prime Gets Boosted The introduction of Prime Reading aroused interest in Amazon (AMZN), as traffic increased by 60% over the past week. The new service grants access to a plethora of Kindle books, magazines, short works and other top products, all without supplementary cost. And since no Kindle is required, Prime membership is expected to spike, thus consolidating Amazon’s positions in the face of competitors like Alphabet (GOOG). Analysts hiked the stock’s price target, citing strong growth for Amazon Prime loyalty service as well as compelling growth in net income, robust revenue growth and expanding profit margins. Amazon continuously tries to add features to incentivize new Prime subscribers. Growth in Prime membership is key for the company, as analysts’ surveys have also found that Prime members tend to spend far more on the platform than non-subscribers. To this end, Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY A) is an option to play the upcoming improvement in Amazon’s balance sheet. Despite a low 3.2% year-to-date performance, Consumer Discretionary Select offers exposure to a sector that is set to regain investor appeal. Financials: Fears of Contagion Escalate Investors seeking clues as to whether Deutsche Bank’s troubles will spread contagion toward U.S. financials have sparked a 57% rise in viewership week-over-week. Both the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan are firmly planted at the dovish end of the policy spectrum, sporting negative rates and pursuing large-scale asset purchase programs. These policies hurt bank profitability and have largely failed so far to boost their respective economies and get inflation off the zero bound. However, the German lender’s struggle seems contained to Europe. Although acknowledged as a net contributor to systemic risk to the global financial system, it is not clear at the moment whether Deutsche Bank is actually in such a distressed situation as to pose a real threat to financial markets. Investors are thus advised to keep a close eye on the bank’s credit default swaps’ movements, as well as future developments regarding the recently disclosed U.S. Department of Justice investigation into mortgage-backed securities misselling. Investors seeking a targeted exposure to the U.S. Financials sector have the Vanguard Financials (VFH A+) at hand. With around 500 individual securities in the underlying portfolio and about 25% exposure to real estate, Vanguard Financials is the go-to option for investing in the banking sector through a risk-adjusted strategy. The Bottom Line The British pound garnered the most attention from our readers, as it continued its downward spiral following Prime Minister Theresa May’s hardline remarks on immigration. Semiconductors have been in the spotlight for their surprising ascent lately, but the performance attracted short sellers. Amazon has continued to grow and consolidate its business, while the oil and gas sector has gotten an unexpected boost from OPEC, which agreed to a production cut. Finally, Financials has been on investors’ minds for fears Deutsche Bank’s issues may spread contagion.

By Liam Tung | October 6, 2016 -- 10:18 GMT (03:18 PDT) | Topic: Laptops Microsoft's latest firmware update aims to boost battery life for the Surface Pro 4, as well as for the Surface Book. Image: Microsoft Microsoft has a bunch of performance improvements in September firmware updates for Surface Pro 4, Surface Book, and Surface 3 devices. For the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book, the update carries Microsoft's latest efforts to chip away at the models' battery-life challenges and deliver a five-star instead of a three-star experience. Microsoft spent much of this year attempting to knock over the two models' restless sleep problems linked to the Connected Standby feature. September's driver updates aim to take its battery life and power management to the next level. Owners of both models can access the September driver updates by checking updates in Windows or viewing the device's Windows update history, Microsoft notes on its Surface blog for IT Pros. Microsoft Surface Book review: High-quality premium-priced 2-in-1 hybrid Interesting design ideas, solid construction and a high-end specification make Microsoft's first hybrid laptop an intriguing option at the more expensive end of the market. Read More Microsoft has two battery-boosting driver updates for Surface Integration, with one that optimizes screen brightness when the device wakes up from sleep or hibernation. There are also two new drivers for Surface Integration Service Device that target power management when applying updates and changing power states. Similarly, a new driver for the Surface UEFI targets stability and performance improvements when switching between power states. It also features two non-power related updates. A new Intel Precise Device driver will improve the stability of the Surface Pro 4's touch after waking up from sleep or hibernation mode. And finally, users should also find it easier to pair the Surface Pen with the Surface device. The September driver updates for Surface Book are identical to those for the Surface Pro 4, with the exception of an update to Surface DTX, which "optimizes log file storage space management". Microsoft has also released a smaller number of driver updates for the Surface 3 and Surface 3 LTE models, including AT&T, non-AT&T, Verizon, and non-North American variants. These updates should improve modem stability and are available for Surface 3s running Windows 10 and Windows 8.1. Details and download links are available on Microsoft's blog. Although Intel has released its new Kaby Lake processors, Microsoft isn't expected to release a successor to the Surface Pro 4 until next year. However, its current lineup of portable Surface devices may be joined by the rumored Cardinal Surface all-in-one, which may include a new Surface-styled keyboard.

Hawkins@andyjayhawk Oct 6, 2016, 10:45am EDT share tweet Linkedin Didi Chuxing Didi Chuxing, the Chinese ride-hail behemoth that is a key ally of Apple and most recently took over Uber’s business in China, is working on developing self-driving cars, according to Bloomberg Businessweek. The company is reportedly scouring Silicon Valley for data scientists and engineers, and Didi co-founder and CEO Cheng Wei has had talks with Gansha Wu, the former director of Intel Labs in China and founder of a Beijing-based driverless car startup called UiSee Technology. (UiSee plans to unveil its self-driving technology at CES in 2017.) Whether that means Didi will acquire UiSee Technology, much in the way General Motors bought Cruise Automation or Uber purchased autonomous trucking startup Otto, remains to be seen. Will Didi be sharing self-driving tech with Apple? The news that Didi is pursuing autonomous driving technology isn’t that surprising. All the major players in the transportation sector, from car makers to internet search companies to ride-hail networks, are locked in a tight race to bring driverless cars to the public. But most experts agree that we won’t be seeing these vehicles on the road in any significant numbers for a decade or more. It’s also a sign of an emboldened Didi, which is riding high after buying out Uber’s Chinese business in early August. The deal put an end to a very expensive, high-stakes battle between the two ride-hail companies over the lucrative Chinese market. It also valued Didi at a whopping $35 billion, which includes a $1 billion investment from Apple. It’s unclear whether Didi’s pursuit of self-driving technology will involve any technology sharing with Apple. We’ve reached out to both companies for clarification and will update this story if we hear back. Didi will need to work fast if it wants to catch up with its competitors. China is already becoming a major staging ground for self-driving cars, with Volvo recently announcing it plans to put 100 such cars in the hands of regular people in the country. Meanwhile, Baidu, the Chinese search company, has been testing its own self-driving vehicles at home and in California. Meanwhile, Southeast Asia’s big ride-hailing company Grab recently announced it was teaming up with self-driving startup nuTonomy to start its own limited, public test of self-driving cars in Singapore last month. And now that Didi plans to join the self-driving race, the competition is sure to heat up.

Andreas Olofsson says the Adapteva Epiphany-V shows a hundred-fold efficiency gain in the way chips can be designed. Some of Olofsson’s gains come from the fact the research chip employs a single core replicated 1,024 times and much of the IP is an evolution from prior designs. Nevertheless, the chip used a state-of-the art 16FF+ TSMC process and fits into a compact 117mm2. Click here to read more ...

Hyperledger is the layer above the operating system, above Linux. Linux is the Linux Foundation’s oldest and hardest of hard-core projects - a technology fundamental that drives economies. The Foundation went beyond Linux ages ago and in 2015 it set a record in starting new projects – 13, nearly half the Foundation’s total. 2016 has seen seven so far – network switch, network analytics and small footprint real time operating systems. The most intriguing is Hyperledger with 30 founding members including IBM who kick-started things donating chunks of its Blockchain code under an ASF licence. For an industry with notoriously poor long-term memory, it’s worth remembering IBM kickstarted the Eclipse open-source tooling framework similarly in the early 2000s. Eclipse succeeded in gutting an entire IDE industry and ended up becoming the open framework tools alternative to Microsoft’s Visual Studio. Hyperledger takes the Blockchain digital ledger asset used in Bitcoin and seeks to turn it into a distributed, secure record of transactions for business - and more. There’s talk of recording not just business transactions, but tracking the provenance of items such as fish and blood diamonds and providing a platform for medical data. Hyperledger is the Foundation’s fastest growing project: after just sit months, there are 85 members - August saw a rush of 17 – with more than 100 contributors. Beyond IBM and corporate familiars like Intel, Fujitsu and Red Hat there are some blue chip names - Deutsche Boerse, JP Morgan and Wells Fargo. Hyperledger executive director lead Brian Behlendorf, the silver-haired Apache web server daddy, says the project has attracted people completely new to the Foundation, too - in startups and fintech. Why? After all, of the two – Bitcoin and Blockchain - it’s the former that’s landed the headlines of a tech and national press desperate for the next big thing. Blockchain has resonated, unlike Bitcoin, precisely because of its familiarity - the ledger - only in a format that promises radical change according to Behlendorf. Financial services like blockchains because they raise the prospect translations can be fulfilled in the same real-time way as they are sealed. Today, when you transfer money online to somebody’s account, sure, you get a notification, but it’s a virtual transaction - the actual money still takes days to actually move between accounts. Hyper-quick cash transfer Blockchain and Hyperledger promises to compact that transfer process, speeding up procedures in transfer and authorisation and doing it securely and to scale. “Some of the early crypto currency experts came across as we have come from Pluto and you have to buy into a bunch of assumptions to get there - that was a big bridge for many,” he told The Reg at LinuxCon. “The lack of dynamic, business friendly leadership hindered its adoption.” “Crypto currency will always have difficulty being accepted in a world of regulation. But [Hyperledger] is a much more immediate connection to systems that they [companies] already have.” The private sector certainly seems intent on something Blockchain-like and devs are responding with Ethereum, Multichain and Eris, too. And their interest hasn’t abated despite recent problems for Ethereum that gave digital block chains a bad rep when it was hacked and $89m pinched. Ethereum was hacked in early summer yet Hyperledger got those 17 new recruits just after in August. Behlendorf reckons firms are learning, and they realised the different between permissioned ledgers and unpermissioned types. The former comprises a known group of permissions givers but with the latter, members can come and go. Hyperledger can do both. But Behlendorf doesn’t dismiss the security risks. The prospect of writing confidential data in big, public stores won’t appeal to very many while there’s the prospect highly records could be cracked using, should it ever materialise, quantum computing. “The most important thing we can do is demonstrate competent development processes, peer review of both architecture and underlying implementation, test suites and security processes, and most importantly, running code in production. That's the trajectory for Fabric and STL [Sawtooth Lake],” he said. The most immediate problem for businesses picking a blockchain technology is the one endemic to open source: proliferation, forking and knowing who to bet on. The Ethereum currency was forked following the hack. “It made it a challenge to convince banks that this was a network they wanted to participate in,” Behlendorf noted. The Foundation believes Hyperledger can avoid forks that might arise through inter personal politics or other disagreements. It claims its standard “IP neutral zone” for Hyperledger and unity in that Hyperledger’s sub projects use exactly the same open-source licence (Apache 2.0). The hope is that with more members comes critical mass. That’s important as Behlendorf’s hope is he can build a system that wraps in other open-source components and other projects that build out Hyperledger. Hyperledger currently consists of two projects: Fabric, a layer for components to plug into, and Sawtooth Lake - a consensus algorithm and that originated from Intel. Both are early but Fabric is already used in pilots - the fundamentals of a chain and smart contracts are already there it’s a question of performance, Behlendorf said. The plan is for Fabric 1.0 within six to nine months. Areas of work include making Fabric capable of supporting permissionless systems. The challenge is governance - the length of the chain can become unwieldy to manage while authorisation that’s done in the CPU can thrash the processor. Another area is encryption libraries that mean participants can view just parts of a transaction, say an account summary, rather view all the data in a transaction behind that transaction. Portable identities is on the list – so members’ identities to work across different chains without need for multiple log ins or different IDs - and smart contract engines. Behlendorf sees potential for homomorphic encryption where computations are be carried out in cipher text and when decrypted match the results in plaintext. Also, he’s interested in zero knowledge proofs where statements can be authorised as true without providing evidence. Other technologies of interest are a browser UI – you currently navigate using a command line and - and having libraries and SDKs work with Python and Java. Behlendorf’s goal is to bring projects together. But how to make the right choices and stop going down dead ends or dismissing projects that have potential in an area filled with that Siren-like mix of potential, enthusiasm and ideas endemic to “the new” in tech? “We do need to be about these communities doing experiments but as they pan out saying ‘finally’. This is my long game that there is a common fabric that does work best for 99 per cent of cases,” Behlendorf says. “I resonate with the innovators trying something high risk, highly divergent from today. If we can apply objective methods to it and become its champion, I feel that’s the way go to.” Ultimately, however, it will be for the marketplace to pick what works - that is those deploying Hyperledger and building the code in the real world. “For me I want to build that marketplace of idea and projects and back the winners,” Behlendorf says.

The ROG G752VS and ROG Strix GL502VS will be available via both offline and online outlets across the country. The Asus ROG G752VS and ROG Strix GL502VS have been blessed with NVIDIA GeForce GTX 10-series graphics cards which the company claims make the two ready to take on VR. The devices also ship with NVIDIA’s G-Sync technology which apparently cuts down on lag and shutter. It further gets rid of visual tearing to make way for a smooth gaming experience. Diving into the ROG G752VS first, the 17.3-inch FHD notebook is priced at Rs 247990. Specs-wise, it runs on Windows 10 Pro and a 6th generation Intel Skylake Unlocked i7 processor which comes equipped with an overclocking toolkit which lets users tune the system up to 4GHz. They’ll also get to take advantage of up to 64GB of DDR4 RAM and a backlit anti-ghosting keyboard with 30-key rollover. One of the top highlights of the Asus device is its dedicated cooling modules for the CPU and GPU. The offering also features a unique thermal design which keeps dust away from internal components. Dual copper heat pipes and the ROG-exclusive 3D Vapor Chamber work together to decrease the GPU temperature by 7°C.

The notebook’s main headline-grapping aspect is its portable design, weighing in at 2.3kg and measuring 30.1mm in terms of height. It sports a 15.6-inch wide-view panel and can be stuffed with up to 32GB of DDR4 RAM. It also comes with support for Asus’ GameFirst III technology for lag-free online gaming.

Computing giants are fighting over one another to get their latest tech attached to our wrists, heads and even feet (yes, ‘smart shoes’ are a thing). Being that Oakley are regarded as the leaders in performance eyewear, it makes perfect sense that they should try and combine their know-how with new tech to build a pair of smart-glasses. Working with Intel and Luxottica Group, the trio has created the Radar Pace glasses. For the unimaginative of you out there try to think of them as Google Glasses crossed with Mr Motivator, and you’ll already have an idea what they are capable of. Is it just us, or do those earbuds look like little frog legs? The connected piece of tech has built-in earbuds to give the wearer useful coaching information and pass on current stats as spoken word. As you would expect from a modern wearable, the Radar Pace can also understand spoken commands too, making them a completely hands-free device. “Ok, Radar” followed by a question or command is enough to get your gigs (more slang words for glasses can be found here) gabbing. Included external sensors connect to the glasses and an app (for Android or iOS) to track activity and, if need be, make on the fly changes to workouts to get the most out of your training. Yes, they are water resistant and play music too! Obviously, the smart tech is only part of the package, and being an Oakley product also means you get a high-quality set of lenses too. Oakley ship the futuristic wearable with their own Prizm™ lens that offers enhanced details brightens white, greens, yellows, and reds and also allow runners and cyclists to see subtle changes in road texture to aid hazard avoidance. Yes, you could look as cool as this guy! Oakley glasses are never usually cheap, and the Radar Pace with all its added technology is no exception. Pricing for these “bionic bins” starts from $449 in the U.S which includes sensors, Prizm™ lens and clear lens, nose pads and a carry case. Can you see yourself chatting to your glasses on a future ride?

Technology Lam Research, KLA-Tencor Scrap Chip Gear Deal On Antitrust Concerns The semiconductor industry has been a stock market winner in 2016, with some ETFs scoring gains of 27%. (iStockphoto) ED CARSON 10/06/2016 Reprints Citing "recent antitrust agency feedback," chip gear giants Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) late Wednesday scrapped their planned $11 billion merger agreement. "We believe that this proposed combination would have resulted in compelling benefits for our customers, employees and stockholders, as well as accelerate innovation in the broader semiconductor industry, so we are disappointed with the outcome," said Lam Research CEO Martin Anstice. Antitrust concerns had been swirling for months, with the two companies announcing in August that they wouldn't meet a planned October closing date. Intel reportedly objected to the Lam-KLA deal, along with Samsung and Hitachi. Intel (INTC) generally opposes key suppliers merging. Chip gear rival Applied Materials (AMAT), which saw its Tokyo Electron merger deal founder on Justice Department objections last year, also likely is happy to see the deal called off. IBD'S TAKE: While Twitter is also on the block, Facebook continues to grow rapidly. Facebook's stock hovers near a buy point. KLA-Tencor raised its quarterly dividend to 54 cents a share from 52 cents. Lam Research and KLA-Tencor fell modestly late Wednesday, following the 6 p.m. ET announcement. But by Thursday's premarket, Lam Research rose 3.4% after hitting an all-time high on Wednesday, ending Thursday up 4.2%, at 100.19. KLA-Tencor rose 1.3% before the opening bell on the stock market today, ending the day up a fraction, at 71.79. On Wednesday, KLA-Tencor rose 1.3% to 71.21, retaking its 200-day and 50-day line.

Like this story, share it with millions of investors on M3 Global device shipment to dip second year in a row: Gartner "The global devices market is not on pace to return to single-digit growth soon. Growth is on pace to remain flat during the next five years," Gartner Research Director Ranjit Atwal said. Post Your Comments Share Cancel Worldwide combined shipments for devices like mobile phones and computers may decline by three percent this year to 2.32 billion units, impacted by fall across segments except premium ultramobiles and entry level phones, a report said today. This will mark the second consecutive year of decline, research firm Gartner said in a report. The global devices market fell by 0.75 percent in 2015 to 2.4 billion units, it added. "The global devices market is not on pace to return to single-digit growth soon. Growth is on pace to remain flat during the next five years," Gartner Research Director Ranjit Atwal said. All segments are expected to decline in 2016, except for premium ultramobiles and utility mobile phones (entry level phones), which are expected to show single-digit growth this year, he added. "We expect premium ultramobiles will start benefiting from the collective performance and integration of the latest Intel CPU platform and Windows 10," Atwal said. Desk-based PCs and notebook shipments are expected to decline from 244 million in 2015 to 216 million units this year and further decline to 205 million (2017) and 199 million units (2018). The PC market is expected to exhibit an 8 percent decline in 2016, as the installed base bottoms out and replacement cycle extensions halt, Gartner said. Ultramobiles premium -- that includes products like Microsoft's Surface Pro and Apple's MacBook Air -- is, however, forecast to gain pace with shipments growing from 44 million units in 2015 to 49 million units (2016) and further to 61 million (2017) and 75 million units (2018). Shipment of basic and utility tablets -- which devices like iPad, iPad mini, Samsung Galaxy Tab S2, Lenovo Yoga Tab 3 and Acer Iconia One -- is projected to fall from 196 million units in 2015 to 177 million this year and further to 173 million in 2017 and remain flat post that. Mobile phone shipment, on the other hand is expected to fall in 2016, but recover in the next two years. Compared to 1.91 billion mobile phones in 2015, shipment is likely to dip to 1.88 billion units in 2016 before recovering to 1.91 billion in 2017 and further to 1.93 billion in 2018. "The smartphone segment continues to grow, albeit more slowly than in previous years, and is expected to reach 1.5 billion units in 2016," the report said. Gartner Research Director Roberta Cozza said this is no surprise as the smartphone market is maturing and reaching global saturation with phones that are increasingly capable and remain good enough for longer. In 2016, the Android market will continue to be bolstered by Chinese vendors offering more affordable premium devices. "We expect the market for premium smartphones to return to 3.5 percent growth in 2017, as stronger replacement cycles kick in and in anticipation of a new iPhone next year, which is expected to offer a new design and new features that are attractive enough to convince more replacement buyers," Cozza said.

Trying to make up for lost time, fame, and probably customers, Wacom has launched a new series of Windows 10 tablets that put artists and creatives at the very center. Like Wacom’s other Windows tablets, the new MobileStudio Pro line combines display, computing power, and stylus in one large slab. But unlike those older models, some of the newer tablets are not only “3D Ready”, some even have 3D cameras. Tablets and cameras don’t always mix well, with the exception of a very few like Apple’s iPad Pros and Google’s earlier Project Tango tablets. The Wacom MobileStudio Pro tablets follow the footsteps of the latter. In fact, those select few tablets sport Intel’s RealSense R200 camera for sensing depth in addition to color. That might be a strange proposition, especially for larger tablets like Wacom’s, but the company is trying to appeal to 3D modelers, CAD users, architects, and the like. Admittedly, the 3D camera will be more of a niche use case. Of course, Wacom’s tablets are more than that. They are, in truth, about the stylus and the digitizer. The MobileStudio Pros, in particular, boast of being Wacom’s first tablets to bear the new Pro Pen 2 technology, that promises an astounding 8,192 levels of pressure and “virtually no lag” and “no parallax” either, two of the most criticized points in graphics tablets of this nature. Unlike an iPad Pro, and more like a Surface Pro, the MobileStudio Pro tablets are, of course, “regular” Windows 10 tablets, which more demanding artists require because of the software they use. No settling for mobile counterparts. There are six models in all, varying slightly in specs, with 13.3-inch and 15.6-inch screens, 64 to 512 GB storage, Intel Core i5 or i7 processors, and NVIDIA Quadro graphics. Unlike Microsoft’s Surface Pro tablets, however, the Wacom MobileStudio Pro isn’t a general-purpose tablet line, but one that is aimed squarely as creative professionals. The prices definitely confirm that, with costs starting at $1,499 at the lowest all the way up to $2,999. The tablets are scheduled to launch in November.

Prices start at Rs 1,81,990 #Asus ROG 0 By tech2 News Staff /  06 Oct 2016 , 13:27 Asus has unveiled a couple of Nvidia GTX 1070-toting laptops in India. The two devices pack in enough hardware to make a decent gaming rig blush. To those not in the know, Nvidia’s 10xx series of graphics cards offer a significant bump in performance when compared to the previous generation. These GPUs, in addition to being more powerful, are also more energy efficient and include modules specifically for enhancing VR performance. The first of the devices is the Asus ROG G752S. This laptop packs in an unlocked sixth generation Intel Skylake chip, an Nvidia GTX 1070 and up to 64GB of RAM. Yes, you read that right. The G752 packs in an unlocked, overclockable CPU. Also note that Asus claims to be using the 1070 and not the 1070m, which means that this GPU will offer desktop class performance in a laptop. It won’t beat a desktop-class 1070, but it’ll certainly come close enough. Asus also throws in an “overclocking toolkit” that will let you boost speeds to 4.0GHz. The goodies don’t end there as the G752S packs in a 120Hz display as well as a 30-KRO keyboard. The second device is the ROG Strix GL502VS. This beast is slim and light, tipping the scales at 2.3kgs, but offering an Nvidia GTX 1070 and a 15-inch monitor. The laptop supports up to 32GB of RAM, but Asus hasn’t specified the CPU. They’ve said that it offers lower power consumption, so we’re assuming that the company’s at least thrown in a U series Intel i7. Asus states that the devices will be available online and offline at prices starting at Rs 1,81,990 and Rs 2,47,990 for the GL502VS and GL752VS respectively.

Enabling access layer bandwidth to evolve incrementally beyond 1 Gigabit per second (Gb/s), the new standard will help address emerging needs in a variety of settings and applications, including enterprise, wireless networks, and more. “End user data needs – both wired and wireless – are continuing to grow, especially as more and more users access the network via ever-faster wireless technologies enabled by IEEE 802.11ac™. Now, the 1000BASE-T uplink from the wireless to wired network is no longer sufficient, and users are searching for ways to tap into higher data rates without having to overhaul the 70 billion meters of Cat5e / Cat6 wiring already sold,” said David Chalupsky, board of directors, Ethernet Alliance; and principal engineer, Intel Corporation. “IEEE 802.3bz is an elegant solution that not only addresses the demand for faster access to rapidly rising data volumes, but also capitalizes on previous infrastructure investments, thereby extending their life and maximizing value.” Building upon the success of and laying out an upgrade path for 1000BASE-T, IEEE 802.3bz defines 2.5 Gigabit (2.5G) and 5 Gigabit (5G) BASE-T Ethernet. The standard, which was fast-tracked for development and completed in less than two years from its initial call-for-interest, specifies Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) parameters, physical layer specifications (PHYs), and management objects for the balanced twisted pair transmission media found in structured cabling. Facilitating up to five times the speed without requiring expensive infrastructure changes, IEEE 802.3bz enables easy, cost-effective scaling of network bandwidth. This innovative enterprise technology addresses an array of needs, including scientific and research computing, content production and editing, industrial design and automation, machine vision, and more. “IEEE 802.3bz is a valuable addition to Ethernet’s expanding family of standards, and its deployment will enable the faster wireless connections promised by the next generation of wireless access,” said John D’Ambrosia, chairman, Ethernet Alliance; and senior principal engineer, Huawei. “The Ethernet Alliance is excited by the promise and opportunities presented by IEEE 802.3bz. We are committed to validating the industry’s expectation of the multi-vendor interoperability of this standard, as the next generation of what some consider to be the most successful Ethernet project ever.” Deliberating the future impacts of 2.5G and 5G BASE-T Ethernet will be a focus of discussions during the Ethernet Alliance’s upcoming Technology Exploration Forum (TEF). TEF 2016: The Road to Ethernet 2026 is September 29, 2016, in Santa Clara, Calif. The organization has also announced plans for a joint 2.5G and 5G BASE-T multivendor interoperability plugfest with the NBASE-T Alliance for the week of October 10, 2016 at the University of New Hampshire InterOperability Laboratory (UNH-IOL) in Durham, NH. Additionally, Mr. Chalupsky, and Ethernet Alliance Board of Directors member, George Zimmerman of CME Consulting explore NBASE-T technologies extensively in their recent Ethernet Alliance white paper, The Spaces of BASE-T.

By Rich Karlgaard Published: Oct 6, 2016 7265 7265 On a recent steamy saturday morning in Hong Kong I made the very slow ten-minute walk from the Hyatt Regency to the campus of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The walk was slow because my northern California bones found the heat and humidity oppressive and I didn’t want to arrive in a sweat-soaked shirt. But there was another oppressive factor to my day. I was scheduled to appear on campus on a panel hosted by HPAIR—the Harvard Project for Asian & International Relations. My panel’s topic: The Bamboo Ceiling. What could I, a Caucasian son of the American Midwest living in California’s Silicon Valley, credibly say about the bamboo ceiling? I resolved to stick to the facts. Google search had armed me with many—and they were damning. In Silicon Valley, nearly all of the large employers are tech companies—Apple, Intel, Google, Facebook, etc. Between 25 percent and 30 percent of professional tech employees are Asian-Americans, mostly first- and second-generation, yet only 14 percent of the corporate hierarchy—the ‘C-suite’—is Asian-American. The most successful company in the world—Apple—had precisely zero Asian-Americans on its list of corporate leaders. I came to my panel armed with these embarrassing facts. My intent was to relay them and shut up. No opinion of mine was going to have any credibility with a Hong Kong moderator and a panel made up of Hong Kong Asians, an Asian-American working for a Vietnamese venture capital firm and a corporate executive from Jordan who lived in Singapore. The audience of 150 students were mostly from Hong Kong, mainland China, India and other Asian and Middle Eastern countries. When the moderator had finished asking her rather predictable questions, she invited the students to ask any questions they had. Bang! The first one was from a young Chinese mainlander. “What about Asian shyness? None of you talked about that! It’s a bamboo ceiling.” Suddenly, there it was—the cultural elephant in the room. All of the panelists had professional reputations to protect, so we hadn’t broached that very personal topic. Though once terribly shy myself, mine had been a Norwegian-American-Midwestern kind—“Ole loved Lena so much he almost told her so” goes the joke. I had plenty to say about shyness, its roots and how it creates barriers to opportunity. But say it here? The young woman’s question turned the panel upside down. During the remaining time it was all anyone on the panel or in the audience wanted to talk about. Shyness is a common affliction among people everywhere but acutely felt among Asians. Entire books have been written on the bamboo ceiling and the roles of shyness and introversion. It must be said that introversion and shyness are not the same thing. Introverts aren’t necessarily shy. They simply prefer to restore themselves through solitude and a good book. Extroverts feel energised by other people. The worst thing to be, however, is an extrovert who is shy, admitted an Asian HR manager on my panel. “You are energised by people, but fear holds you back.” What Is Your Culture? Everyone brings baggage—good and bad—from his or her culture. A surprise bestseller this summer was Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis (Harper, $27.99) by JD Vance. The author is a San Francisco venture capitalist and Yale Law School grad who was born in a small Ohio town. While growing up, Vance split his time between there and another small town in Kentucky. His mother was married and divorced several times, with numerous boyfriends filling in the gaps. Vance’s only role model was his chain-smoking, swearing-like-a-sailor grandmother, who held Vance to high standards. Vance’s memoir is about America’s white underclass, specifically the Scots-Irish who populate Appalachia. Central to this culture is honour. But, writes Vance, as economic prospects fell, the honour became perverted into a binary fight-or-flight response to life’s chal­lenges. The fights were physical and fuelled by alcohol; the flights were people not showing up for work and fathers skipping town. In these politically correct times, it seems rude to talk about culture. But succeeding in a hyperconnected economy depends on our ability to leverage the best and transcend the worst of our cultural heritages. What is your heritage? How has it helped you in your career? What have you had to leave behind? Write and tell me.

Comments By Katherine Noyes Follow IDG News Service | Oct 5, 2016 11:07 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Linux Open Source Software Operating Systems Comments Aug. 25 may be Linux's official birthday, but Oct. 5 is in many ways the day it began to make a real mark on the world. That's when Linux creator Linus Torvalds officially released the first Linux kernel into the wild. "As I mentioned a month(?) ago, I'm working on a free version of a minix-lookalike for AT-386 computers," Torvalds wrote in a newsgroup post on Oct. 5, 1991. "It has finally reached the stage where it's even usable (though may not be depending on what you want), and I am willing to put out the sources for wider distribution." Torvalds released version 0.02 of the kernel that day, unleashing what went on to become one of the most transformational forces in computing history. [ Download the State of the CIO 2016 report ] In the 25 years that have passed since then, Linux has gone on to include some 22 million lines of code. More than 13,500 developers from more than 1,300 companies have contributed to the Linux kernel just since the adoption of Git made detailed tracking possible back in 2005. Roughly 7.8 changes are now accepted into the kernel every hour. It gains 4,600 lines of new code every day. Top corporate sponsors include Intel, Red Hat, Samsung, IBM, Google, AMD, and ARM. "Linux put open source on the map and began the journey of the rise of open source for serious computing," said Al Hilwa, a program director with IDC. The software has both inspired and experienced major evolution since its debut in 1991, said Charles King, principal analyst with Pund-IT. "By the time the OS began making forays into the commercial market a half decade or so later, it became a catchphrase for advocates hoping to overthrow what they saw as Microsoft's hegemony over desktop computing," King recounted. Meanwhile, the software incited nothing short of a revolution in corporate data centers. "The nascent OS became a power on mainframe platforms, then RISC-based systems," King said. "But a funny thing happened along the way: Linux's hardware agnosticism inspired a range of new Intel/x86-based solutions which, in turn, gradually began to undermine proprietary Unix operating systems." The early battles were fought at the edge of the network but eventually worked their way back to the biggest iron. Today, more than half of the new mainframe workloads IBM currently sells are Linux-based, he noted. The OS also continues to expand into new burgeoning areas, including mobile and IoT. "Linux may be celebrating its silver anniversary today," King said, "but for many in the IT industry, the 'little OS that definitely could' has been pure gold."

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 6 October 2016 | MYT 8:00 AM What's next for BMW? Boon and bane: The BMW X2 Concept. Real-time mapping and traffic alerts are things that all types of drivers and all types of cars would benefit from, but the move to full autonomous driving could still be a big gamble for BMW, a company obsessed with driver dynamics. — BMW Group AG At this year's Paris Motor Show, BMW officially unveiled a facelifted 3 Series Gran Turismo, a 300km range version of its plug-in electric i3 city car, a new electric scooter and the X2 Concept, a subtly stunning show car that will be going into production within the next two years as a crossover coupe.  However, the biggest line of questioning aimed at the company's global head of Sales and Marketing, Dr Ian Robertson, was about what is coming next in terms of connected and autonomous cars.  Perhaps that's unsurprising given that BMW is a one-third owner in the hugely ambitious HERE mapping and car data platform and that it recently announced an equally ambitious partnership with Intel and Mobileye that aims to build a completely autonomous production car within the next five years.  "The next big step will be the iNext, in 2021," said Robertson about the car that will not only boast self-driving skills but also an alternative powertrain and cutting-edge connectivity.  However, in the process of building this next-generation car, current generation buyers will also benefit. "Along the way, [its] technology will spread through the brand," he explains.  BMW is at the pinnacle of what's possible with internal combustion engines, but doesn't trying to be a leader in the tech world go against the philosophy of a brand that is all about driving passion?  "I think the two things go together," responds Robertson. "The DNA of BMW always was innovation and technology. That's what we are, that's what we've always been and that's what our brand stands for. It's what our customers expect so you can expect us to keep pushing those boundaries. The fact that we now have thousands of software engineers – that's part of that development."  Driving pleasure and the autonomous world  But even with a burgeoning tech department, to bring real-time connectivity and alerts to fruition that cut accidents, eradicate congestion and take the pain out of motoring, BMW needs Intel supercomputing and Mobileye vision systems.  "We wanted to drive this forward," explains Robertson. And where the partners want to drive it to is to the point where it is a secure, cloud-based platform with phenomenal real-time data crunching skills that is "Open source so that other parties will be able to use it," Robertson points out.  Initially it will use real-time data from BMWs, Audis and Mercedes cars but anyone will be able to integrate the system into their production cars, boosting its capability while reducing industry reliance on tech firms such as Google.  Real-time mapping and traffic alerts are things that all types of drivers and all types of cars would benefit from, but the move to full autonomous driving could still be a big gamble for BMW, a company obsessed with driver dynamics.  Robertson is quick to disagree. For the moment at least, the technology will make driving even better.   "I'm driving a new 7 series. It is semi-autonomous. I drive the first 25km in an autobahn environment, unrestricted. I drive over 250km/h. It makes me feel good in the morning and in the evening. But the last 10km are always in bumper-to-bumper traffic. I stick it into the mode that allows semi autonomy. I don't need to use my feet any more. I can take my hands off the wheel, I can take my eyes off the road, briefly, and that for me is marrying the autonomous world with sheer driving pleasure in an urban environment because not all of it is that much fun." — AFP Relaxnews You May Be Interested Closure of 106 bank branches due to rationalisation plans, says Deputy Finance Minister Weak ringgit to impact 5 sectors Best smartphones for the holidays Alibaba's founder to support 'mini Jack Ma' until university graduation Private-public partnerships in a connected world Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Sabah specialities served in SS3 Parliament rejects Amanah's hudud bill alternative MRT fare starts at RM1 advertisement Latest News Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Make perfect copies of old photos with PhotoScan US trade panel eyes Qualcomm patent complaint against Chinese firms Google commits to post-Brexit UK with major London investment GE acquires two artificial intelligence startups Most Viewed in Tech GE acquires two artificial intelligence startups Best smartphones for the holidays Singapore to launch blockchain project for interbank payments Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Make perfect copies of old photos with PhotoScan Google commits to post-Brexit UK with major London investment Warning!

VMware and its enterprise mobility arm, AirWatch, on Oct. 5 launched both a new category of software and a new endpoint management package to go into it. At the Connect 2016 conference in Atlanta, the company unveiled AirWatch Unified Endpoint Management and a new version of VMware Workspace ONE. The package expands VMware AirWatch into cloud-based management for conventional desktops and new-age connected devices while providing users with the apps and services they need to work digitally, according to the company. VMware Airwatch also revealed new support for internet of things (IoT) devices, touchless sensors and enterprise-level smart glasses on the same mobility management platform. Smart glasses in the near future are expected to replace those hideously big augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) headsets. The smaller, lighter, more portable glasses are still ahead of their time, but the potential market is expected to amount to about 16 million units by 2020, according to Gartner Research analyst Angela McIntyre. Smart Glasses a Thing of the Future VMware Airwatch said it has deals lined up with major providers of smart glasses—which include Intel, Atheer, ODG and APX Labs—to onboard the software, connect to networks and deploy AR and VR apps. The AirWatch Unified Endpoint Management and VMware Workspace ONE developments are the biggest news in the mobility sector in months. "In the nearly 10 years since the launch of the iPhone, enterprise mobility management has transformed from simple wipe and lock commands to a unified endpoint management platform for all devices, including Windows 10 and the internet of things," said Noah Wasmer, VMware's senior vice president of mobile products. "No longer will IT run different systems for different devices; instead we built the single platform to manage all endpoints." Rethinking Legacy Desktop and Laptop Management Unified Endpoint Management provides a holistic and user-centric approach to managing all endpoints in an organization, from mobile and desktop to IoT. It is available as a standalone solution or as a part of VMware Workspace ONE and includes configuration management, operating system (OS) patch management, client health and security management. Workspace ONE, launched earlier this year, enables organizations to scale and tailor their management across unmanaged, BYO (bring your own) and corporate-owned devices in a single platform. The flexible mobile application management framework with adaptive management technologies provides organizations a way to manage all use cases, from standalone mobile application management (MAM) for containerized enterprise apps, to a managed workspace with OS-level MAM, to full device management, Wasmer said. In this latest update to Workspace ONE, VMware provides real-time security across apps through expanded support for multi-device BYOD employees and contractors with new continuous-access policies and consumer-simple application support. These include: --Continuous-access policies that can instantly block access to an application already in use if a device fails compliance tests. A real-life example of this uses beacon technology to create a tightly controlled geographic perimeter. Once removed from the beacon's proximity, the application may be immediately blocked or removed. --Internally developed mobile applications that can now be distributed to unmanaged devices directly through the Workspace ONE app catalog without requiring applications to be loaded into public app stores, greatly simplifying the delivery of new business innovations to employees. --Device compliance-based conditional access for VMware Horizon apps and desktops to extend VMware's access policy engine for virtual apps and desktops.         Chris Preimesberger is Editor of Features and Analysis at eWEEK.

The bad: A higher price, plus expensive accessories. Less RAM and a slightly slower processor than the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and iOS still limits overall flexibility of this iPad. The cost: $532 to $647 The bottom line: It’s still not a full-fledged laptop killer, but the new 9.7-inch iPad Pro is the best iPad ever made — a near-perfect balance of tablet power and portability. Google Pixel C Cnet rating: 4.5 stars out of 5 The good: The Google Pixel C has a slim, compact aluminum design that feels sturdy. Its optional Bluetooth keyboard is equally solid and doubles as the tablet’s cover, and it has a powerful, long-running battery. The tablet runs the latest version of Android, and its performance is lightning fast. The screen is sharp, bright and colorful, and gaming graphics look stellar. The bad: It’s a bit heavy when attached to the keyboard (which is sold separately). Big-name apps and games still tend to hit iOS before Android. The cost: $678 The bottom line: The Google Pixel C is the best Android tablet money can buy. Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Cnet rating: 4 stars out of 5 The good: The Surface Pro 4 fits a larger screen with a higher resolution into a slightly slimmer body than last year’s model. The pen and keyboard cover are also improved, and this is one of the first mobile systems with Intel’s latest processors. The bad: Microsoft still refuses to include the Type Cover keyboard, forcing a separate purchase. Battery life still isn’t enough for a full day. The cost: $688 to $899 The bottom line: A host of small refinements cements the Surface Pro 4’s position as the best-in-class Windows tablet — so long as you’re prepared to pay extra for the required keyboard cover accessory. iPad Pro (12.9 inch) Cnet rating: 4 stars out of 5 The good: The new iPad Pro is the biggest and fastest Apple tablet to date. The pressure-sensitive Pencil stylus offers superior sketching and drawing, and the Pro’s gorgeous screen and quad speakers are ideal for split-screen apps, multitasking and watching movies. The bad: Very few apps are optimized to take advantage of the iPad Pro’s full potential. Its large size makes it less portable than other iPads. Once you’ve paid for the Pencil and keyboard peripherals, the iPad Pro costs as much as a good laptop, but lacks its flexibility. The cost: $708 to $799 The bottom line: The iPad Pro is a dream machine for graphic designers and media mavens, but this elegant tablet needs more optimized apps and accessories before it can fully achieve laptop-killer status.

UN Photo/JC McIlwaine (file) Print 7 October 2016  At a joint meeting of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and the General Assembly’s main economic and financial committee, the respective heads of the two UN bodies today highlighted the need for the benefits of globalization to reach all countries and all peoples. “We have a responsibility to promote narratives that acknowledge that sustainable prosperity for all will come through inclusion rather than exclusion,” said ECOSOC President Frederick Shava in his opening remarks to the joint meeting. Similarly in his own remarks, Dian Triansyah Djani, Chair of the General Assembly’s Second Committee highlighted: “In our world of gaps, there should be special attention of enabling global environment for countries, in particular the developing countries, to provide a considerable share to the global achievements of the SDGs [Sustainable Development Goals].” ‘2030 Agenda provides answers to questions global citizens are asking’ The annual joint meeting is held every year to discuss important economic and financial issues among both bodies’ membership. This year it was under the theme The changing political economy of globalization: Multilateral institutions and the 2030 Agenda. Further in his remarks, Mr. Djani highlighted the importance of collective action for the achievement of SDGs. “We, collectively, will have to demonstrate that the 2030 Agenda provides the answers to the questions being asked by global citizens. The many should work together so the few helpless one are not left behind because of globalization,” he emphasized. Also, Mr. Shava underlined the need to change the “political narratives” that advocate for isolationism, “We have a responsibility to promote narratives that acknowledge that sustainable prosperity for all will come through inclusion rather than exclusion,” he said. Participants at Joint Meeting of Second Committee and UN Economic and Social Council: (left to right) New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, Second Committee Chairman Dian Triansyah Djani and ECOSOC “Too daunting are the challenges of climate change, poverty, conflicts and terrorism, to name a few. The increasingly complex nature of these challenges calls for global solutions as no one country can deal with these issues alone,” the ECOSOC President added. World transformed by seismic events – from iPhone to financial meltdown in 18 months The joint meeting today also featured a keynote address by Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and New York Times Op-Ed columnist Thomas Friedman who in his speech stressed: “We were in an age of acceleration where we needed to reimagine and reflect.” The world is witnessing three non-linear accelerations all at the same time: the market (globalization), Mother Nature (climate change, population growth), and Moore’s Law (technology). These three accelerations are reshaping the world’s politics, geopolitics, the workplace, community, and ethics, he continued. Mr. Freidman went on to recount a series of seismic social and technological events that occurred in 2007, when, among others: Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone beginning the smartphone/apps revolution; Facebook went global; Twitter went global; Airbnb hit the marketplace; “Amazon came out with something called the Kindle;” Github emerged; and IBM launched Watson. Further, he said the cost of sequencing a human genome went from around $100 million down to $1, Google bought YouTube, Intel went off silicon to expand Moore’s Law, and cloud computing took off. “2007 was the biggest technological inflection point since Gutenberg invented the printing press, and we missed it [because] the 2008 economic and financial collapse happened right after,” he said. Subsequently, the market is being fundamentally reshaped. “This is not your grandmother’s globalization,” said Mr. Friedman. Although trade in physical goods and financial products and services – the hallmarks of 20th century globalization – have flattened out and even declined in recent years, the globalization of flows means the world has never been more interconnected. If you want to make something, you’re living in the greatest period in history, but if you want to break something, you’re also living in the greatest period in history – Thomas Friedman “And you haven’t seen anything yet,” he continued, noting that the flows of friends, of renters, opinions, crowdfunding, instant messages, peer-to-peer payments, pictures, education, college courses, design tools, music, video, news, cloud-based tools, searches, raw video, “all of these flows are exploding, and they are the new globalization tying us together.” As such, he argued that the country that built infrastructure and educated its people to connect up to more [of these] flows will be the country that thrives in the 21st century. Mother Nature is exponentially changing too, through climate change, population growth, and biodiversity loss. “You’re all familiar with this one, but Mother Nature is going through her own exponential changes, which we’re seeing in Florida right now,” he noted. Mr. Friedman went on to stress that the workplace would be irrevocably altered and it is necessary to convert artificial intelligence to intelligent assistance and algorithms to allow workers to adapt to exponential change. Lifelong learning will be essential, and “building walls will not stop this change.” Politics and geopolitics would have to adapt as well, as parties will need to become more heterodox and less ideological, or fail. Lastly, ethics will have to evolve. “If you want to make something, you’re living in the greatest period in history, but if you want to break something, you’re also living in the greatest period in history,” he said. “What every human being believes now matters.” It will be necessary to bring back the ‘Golden Rule’ through strong families and healthy communities.

To many casual observers, virtual reality represents the future—of computing, social interaction, gaming, and entertainment. But to industry insiders, who flocked to the Oculus developers conference in San Jose, Calif., this week, the main question is not how VR will shape the future, but how to shape the future of VR. Facebook-owned Oculus has come up with short-term and long-term answers to that question. The long-term answer is perhaps the most intriguing: a very rudimentary prototype of a standalone VR headset, code named Santa Cruz. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg touted it this week as a sort of VR Goldilocks: it combines the best of the Oculus Rift (immersive VR experiences that harness a high-end PC processor and external sensors) with the freedom of the Gear VR (a headset not tied down by wires). I tried the Santa Cruz prototype for all of three minutes—that's all the time Oculus let me have with it. I wasn't allowed to take photos or video, but Facebook showed a quick demo video during a keynote address yesterday, from which we took a few screen shots. The demo consisted of two outdoor scenes that I could walk around and explore, one in outer space and one in a dense city. As a concept, the prototype is fairly simple. Engineers took a Rift, added four cameras to the front and a CPU, graphics card, cooling fan, and battery to the back. There's nothing polished about it. The fan is relatively noisy, the logic board is exposed, and the battery dangled from the bottom of the headband. Once I put it on, though, none of that mattered. The sensation of being completely untethered was something I'd never experienced in VR before, not because I'd never used a smartphone-based headset like the Gear VR, but because this time I didn't have to lower my expectations about the video and tracking quality. I walked right up to the chaperones—the blue barriers that appear when you're about to run into the walls of the physical room you're in—with no pesky real-world wires to get in the way. Meanwhile, the display never stuttered or demonstrated tracking lag, something that occasionally happens with the Gear VR. The only drawback that I noticed during the demo was that it appeared to be demanding very little of the Santa Cruz's onboard processor. Cars, buildings, and other elements looked like polygons, and there wasn't much motion in the scenes. An Oculus engineer wouldn't say whether or not Santa Cruz could run a more demanding demo without its performance suffering, but he did acknowledge that components are Santa Cruz's chief limitation. Intel and Qualcomm are working on their own standalone VR headsets, so Oculus isn't alone in its pursuit of an untethered VR future. As Santa Cruz shows, that future is promising, but it's held hostage by the limitations of fitting powerful components into a headset-mountable enclosure. Oculus's more immediate answer to the VR future question, though, is coming in December: the highly anticipated Touch controllers, which I got to test out with a few of the more than 30 games and other apps that will take advantage of them by next year. PCMag has tried the Touch controllers before, when they were on display at CES 2016. Not much has changed since then, except that many more developers now support them. I found the most useful aspects of the controllers to be teleportation and grabbing objects, which are both a bit awkward to do with a conventional controller. In Killing Floor (trailer below), a post-apocalyptic first-person shooter, I used the joystick on the left controller to teleport. It is a slightly cumbersome two-step process, but it affords a lot of freedom. You can look around by moving the joystick through 360 degrees first, and then releasing it wherever you want to end up. While zombies were approaching, though, it was a lot to remember, and I sometimes dropped my weapon (which I held using the middle finger button) while I was looking for a spot to teleport to. Somewhat easier was the teleportation process that Arktika.1 uses. Throughout the battlefield, there are silhouettes of your characters, and all you have to do is look at them and press a button to be instantly transported to one. The tradeoff is freedom—you can only move to predefined locations. The Touch controller contributes to the realism of the VR experience. I got used to it after about an hour, and felt almost helpless during my final demo, a controllerless Karaoke game for the Gear VR. The controller is available for pre-order now at $199, and ships in December. Check back soon for PCMag's full review.

Source: Goldman Sachs Former SolarCity president and chief operating officer (COO) Tanguy Serra is set to leave the company at the end of the year, amid further executive restructuring in the wake of the US$2.6 billion Tesla deal. “Tanguy has played a pivotal role in helping SolarCity achieve the lowest operations costs in the solar industry. He is extremely talented, but due to overlap at the new company, he is going to pursue a new venture. I’m grateful for everything Tanguy has contributed to SolarCity,” said CEO Lyndon Rive in a statement. Radford Small has been promoted to the role of chief financial officer (CFO) after being a managing director and COO for clean technology and renewables since joining the solar installer in 2015. “Rad has been a tremendous asset—he’s excelled at everything we’ve put on his plate—and he brings an incredibly valuable skillset to a potential combination of Tesla and SolarCity,” said Rive. “This promotion largely reflects the reality of the current roles and responsibilities in SolarCity’s finance department. Rad has been leading our efforts in the capital markets for some time, and has been playing an increasingly visible role in financial planning and analysis, investor relations and accounting.” This news follows Lyndon Rive and CTO Peter Rive foregoing their prior salaries of US$275,000 per annum for just US$1 per annum for their services, which was reportedly instigated as per their request.  centrotherm photovoltaics AG management shake up New centrotherm photovoltaics AG COO and supervisory board member Gunter Fauth.

The company supervisory board has selected Gunter Fauth to succeed long-standing member Peter Augustin as COO. Fauth will join Jon von Schukmann on the supervisory board; the latter being appointed company CEO.  In other news, the company recently withdrew its earnings forecast for fiscal year 2016, due to PV manufacturers postponing capital expenditure (capex) plans on overcapacity and rapid price declines, despite reporting a €42.0 million total for its H1 PV and semiconductor sales.  SunTegra appoints Mark Paille as director of sales Source: SunTegra Integrated solar solution provider SunTegra has appointed Mark Paille as its new director of sales. Previously, Paille led Northeast sales and marketing for Dow Chemical’s Powerhouse Solar Shingle product. In his new role, Paille will be responsible for managing all SunTegra sales as well as developing new channel partners across North America. “We are delighted to have Mark join our team at a time when we’re seeing a huge surge in demand from both solar installers and home builders,” said SunTegra CEO Oliver Koehler. “Mark’s extensive experience selling roof-integrated solar products and developing strong channel partners will enable us to expand sales of our SunTegra Shingle and Tile products and position SunTegra for strong growth in 2017.” “SunTegra is selling a truly disruptive product that offers 40% more power than the Dow Powerhouse Shingles at a price that is 30% less—you bet I’m excited to be here,” said Paille. “There is no doubt in my mind that SunTegra’s product, reliability, comprehensive warranty and strong customer service make them the leading provider of solar shingles and tiles in the US.” Former First Solar exec Bruce Sohn joins Siva Power as vice chairman of the board Former First Solar president Bruce Sohn is Siva Power's latest addition to its management board. Source: Twitter California-based thin-film manufacturer Siva Power has hired solar executive Bruce Sohn as its vice chairman of the board. Sohn brings a wealth of experience to the role, having been a key player in First Solar’s growth as a global thin-film producer and also previously holding leadership positions at Intel corporation. Sohn was First Solar’s president in 2007, where he was integral in growing the company from its pre-revenue stage to the multi-billion dollar enterprise it is today. Siva Power CEO Brad Mattson said in a statement: “If I had my choice of any executive in the world to join our team, it would be Bruce Sohn. What he achieved at First Solar speaks for itself, and it says a lot about Siva and where Siva is going now that someone like Bruce has joined us. We’ve consolidated the best and the brightest minds in the thin-film solar industry and Bruce Sohn is a special addition to that brain trust. It was under his leadership that First Solar, the only American thin-film PV success story, became what it is today. His guidance and leadership will be invaluable to Siva going forward as we become the next success. “Bruce’s extensive experience in growing and managing large teams, and in global manufacturing capability, will prove to be a huge asset to Siva Power as we take our next step into giga-scale manufacturing. We’re really pleased to have him and are looking forward to working together – there’s a lot for us to achieve." Currently, Siva Power is developing CIGS thin-film solar modules at its Santa Clara, California headquarters. Five members of Congress receive solar accolades from SEIA Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid has received the first ever Lifetime Solar Pugilist Award from the SEIA for his solar advocacy in Congress. Source: Flickr/Center for American Progress Action Fund The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) has presented four members of congress with prestigious solar awards for their work in strengthening the industry. Democratic senate leader Harry Reid was the recipient of the first ever Lifetime Solar Pugilist Award and is deemed by the SEIA to be the “strongest advocate for the solar industry ever to serve in Congress.” Indeed, Senator Reid was an instrumental party in securing the ITC extensions in 2008 and 2015 as well as being one of the original architects of the credit. Similarly, four other congress members each received the SEIA solar champion award for their efforts in working to preserve and extend the ITC. The work put in to achieve the credit and its extension cannot be undervalued; with the SEIA estimating that as a result of prolonging the credit, solar jobs will more than double in the US, reaching 420,000 by the end of the decade. Furthermore, solar capacity in the country will more than triple during that time – potentially hitting 100GW by 2020. Senator Dean Heller received the award for his position on the Senate Finance Committee where he ensured that the ITC remained a key component of the final negotiations of the 2015 tax and budget debate. Senator Michael Bennet introduced legislation to allow solar develops to claim the ITC based on when they started construction, instead of when the project was finished, in addition to securing an important reform that allowed for an extension. Fellow award recipient Representative Tom Reed was recognised for his efforts in adopting an “all of the above” approach to American energy policy that encapsulated solar as a disruptive technology. Similarly, Representative Mike Thompson received his award on the back of being an architect of the 2008 ITC extension, as well as being the lead sponsor of the legislation that served as the model for the 2015 extension. “Support for solar energy is support for American jobs and innovation,” said Tom Kimbis, SEIA’s interim president in a statement.  “These five legislators have demonstrated through their leadership in the halls of Congress, their public support and their voting records that they recognize the enormous benefits – from national security to economic development – bestowed on our nation through solar energy. We credit them with recognizing that solar is not a partisan technology, thank them for their relentless support, and proudly present them with these well-deserved awards.” Tags: us, usa, california, germany, europe, thin-film, cigs thin film, solarcity, suntegra, centrotherm photovoltaics, siva power, seia, itc extension, tesla, employment, movers and shakers Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Gen. Michael Flynn during a campaign town hall meeting in Virginia Beach in September. Mike Segar/Reuters | Caption Trump and military adviser differ on blaming Russia for hacks Policy At an event in Boston this week, Michael Flynn, a senior Trump adviser, said he is convinced that Russia was behind hacks into the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee. Paul F. Roberts @paulfroberts October 7, 2016 —Donald Trump may not be ready to blame Moscow for cyberattacks targeting the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, but his senior military adviser says he's convinced it was Russia. Michael Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, said he agreed with assessments from cybersecurity experts that operatives for the Russian government carried out attacks on Mrs. Clinton's campaign and other Democratic Party organizations, even as he decried the "corruption" that he said the hacks exposed. "We should not be surprised that a communist state run by a totalitarian dictator wants to expose the weaknesses of capitalism and, frankly, show the level of corruption that exists in our political process," he said. Asked if he was satisfied with the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike's attribution of the hacks to a  group known as  Fancy Bear, which has ties to the government of Vladimir Putin, Mr. Flynn said he was. "Yeah, it seems to make sense that there's a concerted effort to understand what’s going on in our political campaigns." The former head of the military's Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Flynn said he was not surprised by a foreign power's interest in the US election and he expressed curiosity about whether there might be additional revelations from the hack. Documents from the breach led to embarrassing revelations about friction within the party and prompted the resignation of DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz on the eve of the Democratic convention in August. "So, a state-backed attack against our political – I mean, against anything – is like, 'OK, that’s not surprising,' " Flynn said. "What they have decided to do and what they’ve decided to expose, you know, we’ll have to wait and see what’s about to come out. What’s been exposed is the level of corruption. I mean there’s an enormous level of corruption that’s been exposed in our election system," he added.  After the DNC revealed this summer the cyberattack on the organization, a previously unknown hacker known as Guccifer 2.0 took credit for the attack. Soon afterward, the antisecrecy organization WikiLeaks began publishing the DNC's internal documents and emails. This week, WikiLeaks said it will release more documents ahead of the election.  Follow Passcode! Cybersecurity news and analysis delivered straight to your inbox. Many experts have suggested that Guccifer 2.0 is a cover for Russian operatives who handed the stolen documents to WikiLeaks. Flynn said WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is doing work left undone by the Department of Justice, which investigated Clinton's use of a private email server when she served as Secretary of State but did not bring charges against the Democratic candidate. "It's sad that the Department of Justice ... isn't doing anything about it," he said of the investigation of Clinton. "Whereas everyone's hoping Julian Assange does what the Department of Justice should be doing." Since the beginning of Mr. Trump's candidacy, Flynn has been one of his most ardent supporters. He was widely reported to have been a short list candidate for vice president, though Trump eventually chose Indiana Gov. Mike Pence.  The retired general is now chief executive officer of Flynn Intel Group, a consulting firm, and was in Boston on Wednesday speaking about the cybersecurity challenges facing the US at  Flight 2016, an event organized by the software firm Black Duck.  Trump has also expressed doubts about who is responsible for the hack of the Clinton campaign, the DNC, and other Democratic party groups, quipping in his first debate with Clinton that the hacks could have been carried out by a  " 400-pound hacker … sitting on their bed." The FBI is investigating the Clinton and DNC hacks, but has not yet attributed the incidents to any nation or actor. Flynn has courted controversy before in regard to Russia and Mr. Putin. He has appeared as an unpaid commentator on RT, the Russian broadcast network. And he sat next to President Putin at  an event hosted by the network in 2015, raising eyebrows in Washington.  In an interview with The Washington Post, Flynn likened CNN and MSNBC to the state owned and heavily censored RT and called the controversy over his dinner with Putin "boring." Flynn's comments in Boston drew sharp rebukes from cybersecurity experts. "Frankly, that’s just offensive," said Ira Winkler of Flynn's comments about the hacks uncovering corruption in the US political system. "Russia isn't looking to uncover corruption in the US election system. It’s looking for whatever benefits Russia the most." Anger and concern about Russia's forays into US politics and the election system have generally cut across party lines, said Mr. Winkler, president of the Internet Security Advisors Group. "This is geopolitical manipulation. You can’t say, "It's OK because it supports my worldview,' " he said. "This is like NATO where an attack on one country is an attack on everyone. An attack on one party should be treated as an attack on all." Follow Passcode! Cybersecurity news and analysis delivered straight to your inbox.
