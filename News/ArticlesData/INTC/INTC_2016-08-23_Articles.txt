Yes Zen may be the turning point in an industry where Intel has grown complacent about its status as top dog. In early benchmarks, AMD's Zen competes favourably. In a recent showing, AMD showed off Zen as capable of delivering 40 percent better per clock than previous generations of AMD hardware. Not only that though, but it showed a head to head between a new, Zen Summit Ridge CPU with 8 cores, 16 threads, and a Broadwell E Core-i7 with the same number, competing very evenly. This is clock for clock and the Zen CPU is set at 3.0GHz for now, but we would expect that figure to rise in the coming months as development continues and cooling options improve. AMD will offer a full range of Zen chips when they finally debut, with everything from server chips, right through enthusiast desktops, to laptops, low end tablets and mobile. It's hitting every point and will offer strong competition against all competitors at all price points - supposedly. That's quite a hard target to aim for, especially since high performance probably means AMD won't be as competitive as it usually is on price. But it needs to bring the fight to Intel to force that competitive development which so drove forward the Conroe developments back in the mid '00s.

Is Linux Mint 18 the best desktop operating system? Why did Gentoo Linux fade into obscurity? Video How IBM's Watson will change cybersecurity Linux and old Mac computers Apple is known for its planned obsolescence strategy that encourages customers to upgrade their Macs every so often. This can result in older Macs that can't update to the latest version of macOS, but are still perfectly functional computers that can perform many everyday computing tasks such as web browsing, word processing, image editing, etc. So what can you do with an older Mac that no longer gets macOS updates? You can install Linux and breathe new life into that old Mac computer. Distributions such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Fedora and others offer a way to continue using an older Mac that would otherwise be cast aside. Phil Shapiro reports for FOSS Force: These days, thanks to Apple’s move to Intel about a decade back, bringing new life to an old Mac by installing your favorite Linux distro is just as easy as it is with a standard PC, as you will see in this video. All Macintosh computers from about 2006 onwards were made using Intel CPUs and installing Linux on these computers is a breeze. You don’t need to download any Mac specific distro — just choose your favorite distro and install away. About 95 percent of the time you’ll be able to use the 64-bit version of the distro. On CoreDuo Macs, from 2006, you’ll need to use a 32-bit version. Here is a screencast video I made on a revived Macbook that came into my hands recently. I downloaded Linux Mint 18 Xfce 64-bit ISO, burned it to DVD, inserted it into the Macbook (after the Macbook was turned on) and then booted the Macbook from DVD by holding the the letter “C” (which tells the Mac to boot from the optical drive). More at FOSS Force The article on FOSS Force about using old Macs to run Linux caught the attention of Linux redditors and they shared their thoughts about it: IBlowAtCoding: “Linux is very modular and customizable. Upgrading to latest OSX with old hardware is definitely going to see a performance decrease but doing so with Linux it may not be the case. For example, you could choose a more bare bones distribution, you could choose a very simple desktop environment (Openbox instead of Unity), etc. I even have some shit laptop with the latest Debian where I don’t even run a GUI at all and just use the terminal and tmux.” Faissaloo: “…with OSX you have a choice between incompatibility and planned obsolescence. With Linux you get neither.” Maximiliankolb: “i don’t want to be judgmental in any kind of way, but using machines slower than a new raspi3 for 30$ is probably a waste of resources itself. as others have pointed out, they just use a hell lot of power, while not being reliable. the effort to support all those different models is too high, comparing to a fairly standard and well tested raspi3 setup. i like using used/ refurbished machines, but there are boundaries!” Noxygen: “I still use an IMac from 2008 under linux. As the screen is good and big, and power consumption quite low, it makes a perfect second computer for monitoring and administrating my rtmp server.” BaronVonD: “You can also download a PowerPC version of Deb/Ubuntu for even older Macs, run that using lxde or any other light weight environment. I have an iMac G3 that I was trying to get Lubuntu installed, just for fun. Had some issues on install, so I haven’t done much with that, but I might try again today.” CompsciKinder: “I run g4 and g5 powermac with ubuntu ppc. Works great still great cpus! I use them for testing software for specific use cases so I don’t care about efficiency.” Tiv: “Just keep in mind that there are Macs out there that have a 32-bit UEFI implementation and a 64-bit CPU. Which means that downloading a 64-bit distro doesn’t automatically guarantee that you can boot from it. Some distros don’t include EFI stubs for both architectures. Canonical at some point shipped a specific EFI+Mac version for that reason I believe. If you encounter this problem just use rEFInd and be done with it.” Macbookairquestion: “Apple want you to replace their products every several years. I had to deal with a 2008 MacBook Air. It is not supported by the latest OS X versions. The latest OS X which is running on it (Lion) does not get any security updates anymore. Linux is a good the only way to continue to use this well manufactured computer for average tasks in a secure manner.” AlwaysManaged: “Just out of curiosity, how is this “reviving” the computer? If it already had OSX on it, why not just restore it to factory settings and upgrade it to whatever the latest release it’ll run is? I don’t see how installing linux makes a difference for the hardware…OSX is already a unix-based OS.” Djxfade: “Because in the case of Mac’s that Apple have abandoned, like the PPC hardware, the first few Intel generations etc. they can only run old and unsupported OS X versions. On the PowerPC hardware, you are screwed, because it is permanently stuck on Leopard, a 10 year old OS. By installing a flavor of Linux, you get access to the latest software, security patches, and a modern browser. The older Safari versions are useless today.” More at Reddit 8 Linux file managers to try Linux offers a wide range of choices when it comes to file managers. A writer at opensource.com has a helpful overview of 8 Linux file managers worth using. David Both reports for opensource.com: One of the most common administrative tasks that end users and administrators alike need to perform is file management. Managing files can consume a major portion of your time. Locating files, determining which files and folders (directories) are taking the most disk space, deleting files, moving files, and simply opening files for use in an application are some of the most basic—yet frequent—tasks we do as computer users. File management programs are tools that are intended to streamline and simplify those necessary chores. Many people aren’t aware of the wide array of choices available in file managers, nor do they realize the full capabilities of the ones they do know about. As with every aspect of Linux, there are many options available for file managers. The most common ones provided by my favorite distribution, Fedora, are: Midnight Commander Konqueror Dolphin Krusader Nautilus Thunar PCmanFM XFE More at Opensource.com Pokemon GO has lost millions of players Pokemon GO took the mobile gaming world by storm when it was first released, quickly becoming one of the most popular games on Android and iOS devices. But now the game is losing millions of players, and its popularity might prove to very short lived indeed. Tom Mendelsohn reports for Ars Technica: It had almost 45 million daily users in July, but this figure appears to have sunk by more than 12 million since the start of August, to just over 30 million said to be playing Pokémon Go. Further decline is expected, as downloads, engagement, and the time users spend on the app have all also visibly flopped, according to data provided by Sensor Tower, SurveyMonkey, and Apptopia. Bloomberg, which saw the raw data, reported that other major apps such as Twitter, Facebook, and Snapchat “can breathe a sigh of relief” that Pokémon Go is finally wobbling, as the game’s popularity had apparently been costing them considerable amounts of users. Developer Niantic is persevering with the game, however, and is due to release version 0.35.0 for Android and 1.5.0 for iOS. According to the patch notes, players “will now be able to learn about a Pokémon’s attack and defence capabilities from their Team Leader to determine which of their Pokémon have the most potential for battle.” More at Ars Technica Did you miss a roundup?

Artificial intelligence and machine learning are opening up another front in the sprawling competition between Intel and Nvidia that has stretched from the data center and high-performance computing environments to autonomous vehicles. Both chip makers see the nascent artificial intelligence (AI) space—and the machine learning that helps enable it—as key growth areas and have made significant recent pushes into the market, and each sees the other as primary competitors. Now the two companies are looking to grab mindshare around AI in the industry by both touting their own technologies while throwing shade at the other's. As Intel executives at the Intel Developer Forum (IDF) last week unveiled a range of moves the company is making to address the needs in the emerging market, Nvidia officials fired off a post on the vendor's blog questioning some of the benchmark numbers Intel was using comparing its many-core Xeon Phi processors to Nvidia's GPUs. Ian Buck, vice president and general manager of Nvidia's accelerated computing unit, in the blog post downplayed methods Intel used in trying to pump up the benchmark numbers for Xeon Phi. "While we can correct each of their wrong claims, we think deep learning testing against old Kepler GPUs and outdated software versions are mistakes that are easily fixed in order to keep the industry up to date," Buck wrote. "It's great that Intel is now working on deep learning. This is the most important computing revolution with the era of AI upon us and deep learning is too big to ignore. But they should get their facts straight." In his own blog post this week, Jason Waxman, corporate vice president in the Intel's Data Center Group and general manager of the company's Data Center Solutions Group, pushed back, noting what he said is the company's strong position as the AI market grows and the worry that may cause competitors. "However, arguing over publicly available performance benchmarks is a waste of time," Waxman wrote. "It's Intel's practice to base performance claims on the latest publicly available information at the time the claim is published, and we stand by our data." The argument echoes similar ones the two companies have made in the past in such areas as high-performance computing (HPC), where Intel processors are the dominant CPU in the systems but Nvidia's GPUs are increasingly being used as accelerators to help boost the performance and power efficiency of the machines. Intel has responded with Xeon Phi, which initially could be used only as coprocessors for accelerating performance but, since the release last year of the 72-core Knights Landing chip, can now be used as the primary processor. Intel has argued that running HPC workloads on its x86-based architecture—both its Xeon and Xeon Phi chips—makes sense, while Nvidia officials have said GPUs offer greater performance in parallel processing environments. Some of the debate around AI is similar. Nvidia executives for the past several years have said that AI and machine learning—which aims to train neural networks to enable artificial intelligence so systems can learn from experience, much like a human brain does—are key technologies for the company's future. In April, Nvidia unveiled the Tesla P100, a massive chip based on Nvidia's 16-nanometer Pascal architecture that packs 150 billion transistors, as well as the DGX-1, a supercomputer for deep learning and AI that combines eight Tesla P100 GPUs with two Intel Xeon server chips to drive 170 teraflops of performance in a 3U (5.25-inch) form factor. "Deep learning has the potential to revolutionize computing, improve our lives, improve the efficiency and intelligence of our business systems, and deliver advancements that will help humanity in profound ways," Nvidia's Buck wrote. "That's why we've been enhancing the design of our parallel processors and creating software and technologies to accelerate deep learning for many years. Our dedication to deep learning is deep and broad. Every framework has NVIDIA-optimized support, and every major deep learning researcher, laboratory and company is using NVIDIA GPUs." In his own blog post, Intel's Waxman said Intel is "inherently well-positioned to support the machine learning revolution." Intel chips power more than 97 percent of servers used for running machine learning workloads, and "while there's been much talk about the value of GPUs for machine learning, the fact is that fewer than 3 percent of all servers deployed for machine learning last year used a GPU." He also noted other efforts by Intel in the AI space, including the planned release of a Xeon Phi chip dubbed "Knights Mill" with enhanced variable precision and flexible high-capacity memory that is aimed at AI workloads, the commitment to open frameworks for machine learning—including Caffe and Theano—and the acquisition of Nervana Systems and its machine learning technologies.           LATEST SERVERS ARTICLES   Microsoft Plans to Build a Quantum Computer Cray, SGI Awarded $52 Million in Federal Supercomputer Contracts IBM, OpenPower Foundation Make Push into Europe GPU's Role in Artificial Intelligence Advances Featured at Conference EMC Shows Its Data Center Strength at Inaugural Dell EMC Conference                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

In San Francisco last week Intel executives showed off two new technologies for storing data and moving it around that could shake up established ways of designing computers. The new technologies are primarily being targeted at the giant data centers that power mobile apps, websites, and emerging ideas in artificial intelligence. They could also benefit consumers more directly by appearing in consumer products. Intel needs some new markets. In April the company announced it was laying off 12,000 workers and abandoning making chips for mobile devices, a huge market Intel missed out on. The company has also had to slow the pace at which it brings out new generations of smaller transistors, a trend that has underpinned the industry and Intel’s business for decades (see “Intel Puts the Brakes on Moore’s Law”). One of Intel’s new technologies is a form of data storage that’s faster than the flash disk used in laptops and data centers today. Intel calls it Optane, and it is based on technology called 3D Xpoint, developed in collaboration with memory manufacturer Micron. Intel has not disclosed how 3D Xpoint works, but it is believed to write data by heating a glass-like “phase change” material (see “A Preview of Future Disk Drives”). Silicon chips with built-in lasers allow this gadget to add a new kind of high-speed, optical fiber data link to data center computers. Intel says it will launch Optane disks in 2016 and memory chips that fit into the same slots as a computer’s RAM in 2017. At Intel’s annual developer conference last week, Frank Hady, a technical leader on the project, showed a computer with a prototype Optane disk processing database records in a task common in the data centers of companies such as Facebook at three times the speed of a computer with a flash disk. Hady said an Optane drive can locate and access a piece of data in a tenth the time a flash disk, or SSD, would need. In the past few years, flash disks have been enthusiastically adopted by computing companies to make servers and consumer PCs snappier. If Optane drives appear in PCs, they should also boost performance. And Ethan Miller, a professor and director of the Center for Research in Storage Systems at the University of California, Santa Cruz, says that Intel and Micron’s technology could have an even larger impact than flash on how people build and use computer systems if researchers and companies outside Intel embrace and experiment with it. For instance, Optane memory chips might offer ways to make the expensive data center systems that underpin search engines and social networks much more efficient—something large Internet companies such as Facebook would gladly pay for. Optane memory chips also retain their data when powered off, unlike RAM. That should make data center systems quicker to recover after crashes or power outages. Intel also announced a new way to move data between computers last week. The company has begun manufacturing silicon chips with tiny, built-in lasers as a way to replace some copper cables inside data centers with fiber optic ones. Fiber optic links are today mostly limited to long-range connections, such as telecom networks, because of the size and expense of the components needed. Intel’s technology can send 100 gigabits of data per second over a single optical fiber a few millimeters thick. Production problems derailed Intel’s previous promise to launch its silicon photonics technology in 2013 (see “Intel’s Laser Chips Could Make Data Centers Run Better”). But the company now appears to be on track to beat IBM, Cisco, and others working on similar technology. “We are the first to light up silicon,” said Diane Bryant, who leads Intel’s data center business, at the company’s event last week. Bryant said that Intel’s silicon photonics technology will initially be used to connect network gear inside data centers. But after that it will be used to link up servers, and Intel also hopes to replace some of the metal cables inside individual computers with silicon photonics links. That could free engineers to rethink conventional computer designs, which are constrained by the performance of copper cables. Intel has previously said silicon photonics could eventually be used to make data cables and computers used by consumer faster. Microsoft’s Kushagra Vaid, who leads work on the hardware behind its Azure cloud computing service, spoke alongside Bryant. He said he expected to rely on the technology as a way to keep increasing the volume of data his fleets of servers can process, because they are going to become constrained by conventional connections. “We need some new technologies,” he said. “It’s a great way to continue that scaling.” From Our Advertisers Sponsored by Google for Work Survey: Machine Learning Trends, Challenges, and Opportunities In partnership with Dynatrace Emerging Trend Analysis: What is Digital Performance Management?

AMD recently pulled the curtain back somewhat at a special press event during Intel’s developer forum in San Francisco. However, now AMD is revealing every naked detail of a processor core technology that may give Intel’s “Kaby Lake” desktop processors a hard time on the market next year. As previously reported, Zen cores will have 40 percent more instructions per clock than the previous “Excavator” generation. Each core will have two threads (lanes), and access to 8MB of shared L3 cache, a large amount of “private” L2 cache, and a micro-op cache. Other highlights include two AES encryption units for security, and transistors based on energy-efficient FinFET process technology. Related: AMD confirms that DirectX 12 support is coming to ‘Deus Ex: Mankind Divided’ AMD considers its Zen core a “clean sheet” design, meaning the company nearly started over from scratch and uses very little from its previous CPU architecture. With Zen, AMD is pushing to increase the performance per clock while decreasing the amount of energy needed per cycle. And while AMD created a wide performance/energy usage gap with its Excavator core technology, Zen seemingly balloons that gap to an even higher amount in a rather short distance on AMD’s core technology timeline. In a slide displayed during the convention, AMD listed a number of performance and power improvements offered by Zen, including faster L2 and L3 cache, up to five times more L3 bandwidth, a large Op Cache, larger instruction schedulers, and so on. AMD said Zen even includes “low power design methodologies” to achieve higher performance while keeping the power consumption low. On a more technical level, the Zen core architecture is comprised of a number of parts. AMD’s “Fetch Four” x86 instruction units, micro-operations cache instruction units, four integer units, two load/store units, and two floating point units. There’s also a four-way I-Cache amount of 64K, an eight-way D-Cache of 32K, and an eight-way L2 Cache of 512K. Again, each core supports two threads, and access to a larger shared L3 cache. In practice, this is similar to Intel’s Hyper-Threading, though the architecture that enables AMD’s take on it differs dramatically. Additional slides provided by AMD reveal even deeper Zen details covering the Zen core’s fetch, decode, execute, load/store and L2, and floating point capabilities. The new slides even reveal Zen’s cache hierarchy, an SMT overview, and a “CPU Complex” diagram showing four Zen cores connected to an L3 cache. This diagram displays each core with 512K of “private” L2 cache and “public” access to eight units of L3 cache at 1MB each. Finally, AMD provided a new list of instructions not offered in the previous Excavator generation. One instruction is called ADX, which extends the multi-precision arithmetic support. Another instruction called RDSEED compliments the RDRAND random number generation. There are six additional new instructions for clearing the cache line, combining 4K page tables into a 32k page size, and more. Intel may have a challenger once again Okay, okay, that’s a lot to take in. What does it mean? Accroding to AMD, it means its processors will again be performance-competitive with Intel hardware. Zen is a huge leap in performance  — about 40 percent more instructions per clock — compared to Excavator, far more than we’ve seen from new generations of AMD hardware in recent years. The company is also lower power targets with Zen. It expects the fastest desktop parts to have a thermal design power between 95 and 100 watts. That’s right in line with high-end Intel hardware, which over the past few generations as hovered in the 90 watt range. AMD further believes the design will scale down better than past architectures, which means low power envelopes — such as 15-watt parts intended for laptops — should fair well. AMD’s new Zen cores will first be used in its “Summit Ridge” processors. The first Zen-based product will appear in the high-end desktop market. A release date is not confirmed, but will be in early 2017. After that, the Zen-based chips will roll out to the enterprise-class server market, followed by mobile PCs, and the embedded application market (tablets, smartphones, and the like).

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Aug 24, 2016 at 2:04PM Image source: Intel.  About a year ago, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) introduced a chip known as the Core i7 6700K. It is based on the company's newest Skylake processor architecture and is targeted at the PC gaming and enthusiast market, a sub-segment of the personal computer market that Intel CEO Brian Krzanich says "continues to grow at a double-digit rate". Interestingly, when the 6700K first arrived, Intel had a lot of trouble building enough of them to meet demand (likely as a result of some combination of robust demand and production difficulties related to the company's 14-nanometer chip manufacturing process). Fast forward to today, and Intel seems to have its 14-nanometer manufacturing yields in good shape, so manufacturing these parts is no longer an issue. Additionally, the excitement around a product that's now a year old probably isn't what it was when the product first launched. But as a result, it would appear Intel has cut prices on the Core i7 6700K. Does this bode poorly for the company's future revenue or profitability? Core i7 6700K now available for $319 According to Intel's Processor Price List document, the official recommended customer price for the Core i7 6700K is $339. However, on both Newegg.com as well as Amazon.com, the pricing of the 6700K chip has fallen to $319. Generally speaking, it's not in a company's best interest to reduce pricing on a product if demand is robust at a higher price point -- price cuts often come when a company is trying to stimulate demand for a product. The fact that Intel has reduced pricing on the 6700K by $20 (or approximately 6%), seems to suggest that it's trying to do just that to reignite interest in the chip. A refresh would be helpful here The problem is that a year after the 6700K launched, Intel should be ready to launch its successor, the Kaby Lake-based 7700K. According to a recent leak, the product looks quite compelling, offering a solid increase in out-of-the-box performance. Unfortunately, according to that same leak, Intel has delayed the launch of its Kaby Lake family of desktop processors from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the first quarter of 2017. This means that the company is going to be stuck selling 6700K chips at depressed levels for several more quarters before refreshing the product line to shore up average selling prices. A potential offsetting factor Although Intel seems to have cut prices on the 6700K, it's worth pointing out that for gamers and enthusiasts, the chipmaker offers an entirely separate product line known as the high-end desktop, or HEDT, lineup. These parts feature greater core counts than the 6700K (the current lineup comes in six, eight, and ten-core options) but are built on a previous generation processor architecture (Broadwell instead of Skylake). They're also significantly more expensive than the 6700K, with the lowest cost model in the lineup beginning at $420 on Newegg.com. Interestingly, generation-on-generation, Intel actually increased the prices of its Broadwell-based high-end desktop parts, as you can see in the table below: Product configuration Haswell Launch Pricing Broadwell Launch Pricing Price Change 6C/12T w/ 28 PCIe Lanes $389 $434 +11.6% 6C/12T w/ 40 PCIe lanes $583 $617 +5.8% 8C/16T w/ 40 PCIe lanes $999 $1,089 +9% 10C/20T w/ 40 PCIe lanes N/A $1,723 N/A Data source: Intel processor price list. With the higher price tags, it appears Intel may be betting on gamers and enthusiasts moving over to the high-end desktop product line rather than staying with mainstream parts. Longer-term implications of moving to high-end desktop platform The market for gaming-oriented personal computers and components is a unique one. According to ASUSTek, a major vendor in this industry, the segment should grow at a 20% to 30% annual pace "over the next few years" (via DIGITIMES). That figure combines both desktop and notebook PCs, but I would imagine that both platforms are expected to enjoy some unit growth. Intel is well-positioned to capitalize on the secular growth trends in both of these markets (its offerings for both platforms are extremely strong). However, I don't think Intel is content to simply ride the secular unit growth wave. Intel wants to build products that bring additional value to the market in a bid to drive richer average selling prices. By more aggressively marketing its high-end desktop products, it can potentially drive improved average selling prices.  As far as margins go, the high-end desktop chips are based on the same silicon as chips that go into servers. This means the chip sizes are larger and more expensive to manufacture. However, at the current selling prices, it's likely that raw gross margins on these products are much higher than their mainstream counterparts. If Intel can continue to improve its high-end desktop offerings -- something that various leaks show that it is indeed doing -- then the company's gaming business could see both top and bottom line boosts in the years ahead.

China is one of the world’s largest consumers of semiconductor devices thanks to its manufacturing might, and is planning to spend more than US$100 billion to also become a premier supplier to the planet. The global consultancy estimated that by 2020, almost 55 percent of the world’s memory, logic and analog chips will flow to or through the country. However, the vast majority of the microchips that act as the brains of products like Apple Inc’s iPhone are largely imported from companies like Intel Corp and Samsung Electronics Co. The Chinese government in 2014 moved to change this with plans to invest more than US$100 billion and become a leading global player. It has also driven consolidation among domestic suppliers to maximize its investments, including the US$2.8 billion merger of Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd (清華紫光) and Wuhan Xinxin Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp (武漢新芯集成電路) announced last month. China’s efforts to build a world-leading semiconductor industry are part of a broader effort to wean itself off foreign technology. However, financial investment will not be enough to buy leadership of the semiconductor sector, which is worth about US$1 trillion according to Singapore-based Bain partner Kevin Meehan. The country currently makes just 15 percent of the semiconductors it consumes, Bain said in a report. By 2020, Bain expects Chinese-based plants to produce just 7 percent of the world’s microchips, barely up from current levels. “China is coming at it in a pretty smart and intelligent way, but I don’t see a path for them to own leading-edge processor technology and that is the foundation of Intel, the foundation of Samsung’s success,” he said. Efforts by Chinese companies to buy rivals with intellectual property in the processor and memory markets have run afoul of regulators around the world. Plans for a US$3.8 billion investment in Western Digital Corp were scrapped amid a US security review and investments in Taiwanese chip companies face regulatory obstacles and have stoked political tension. “Assuming they can spend it all, the biggest risk is that they end up with a whole bunch of fragmented and weak follower positions,” Meehan said. “There’s ways for them to have influence over greater than 10 percent if they’re partnering well, but otherwise I think you’re essentially capped there,” he added. Meehan said China’s semiconductor makers could eventually learn from partnerships with global giants and become one of the larger suppliers of key components like computer memory. Both Intel and Qualcomm Inc have agreed to build semiconductor fabrication plants there in partnership with local providers. “If you take a long view — not five years, but decades — then certainly you’d have to believe there’s some absorption, but people are careful not to put their leading-edge IP [intellectual property] in China,” he said. “I don’t see a way to get there without licensing or buying,” Meehan added.

The Skull Canyon is small–really small. At just 8 inches long, 4 inches wide, and about an inch deep, it packs the latest 6th Generation Intel® Core™ i7 processor with Intel® Iris™Pro Graphics, offering the highest end integrated graphics solutions out there. There’s a performance, size, and power envelope advantage to having a CPU and GPU on the same physical piece of silicon that allows the system to be super thin, making it even smaller than most laptops, and significantly smaller than any of the major gaming consoles currently on the market. Motherboard spoke to Intel’s Mitchell Lum to learn how the latest generation of the Intel® NUC (code named Skull Canyon) represents the next evolution of extremely powerful, small form factor, desktop PCs. MB: Hey Mitchell. Thanks for speaking with us. We’re really excited about this tiny but powerful little unit. Can you give us a little background on the latest Intel NUC project? The Skull Canyon product is the latest version of our Intel® NUC (Next Unit of Computing)–strictly speaking Skull Canyon is a code name. A number of years ago, a team at Intel said “Hey, we think we can do better with really, really small form factor PCs, and drive a new usage model and new market.” In particular, these units are great for a little media PC. The earlier versions of the NUCs, inspired Gigabyte to do a system called the Brix Pro, which used our 4th generation Intel® Core™ i7 with Iris™ Pro graphics, and in 2014, Intel, in conjunction with Valve, did a hardware seeding at their Steam Dev Days event where all of the devs that attended got one of these machines as a Steam OS dev kit. These products were really popular with game devs. Many of them, realistically speaking, either dual booted them or just put Windows on them. What the devs really liked them for was for going to trade shows. So, if you’re doing a festival or trade show, and you need a reasonably high powered PC, you’ll usually take a big desktop computer, which is difficult to travel with, or a laptop, which you’d still want an external monitor with. So devs have been traveling with these Gigabyte Bricks Pros, and they’re great little machines. But that was 2 years ago, and we now have 2 generations of newer machines–and that’s where we are with the Skull Canyon. Skull Canyon Intel® NUC MB: So what’s currently in this machine? How has it been updated from those previous versions? Just like the previous version, this has the Intel® Iris™ Pro graphics in it. It’s a 45w processor, and it should be highly competitive with some of the mobile discrete graphics cards. It’s able to play Just Cause 3. If you look at the price point for this product, if you looked at building one of these systems out, in comparison with building out a small form factor traditional desktop, it’s almost the same price. If size and space is at a premium for you as a user, this product is something you should definitely consider. Whether that’s game developer traveling, or people using it as a living room gaming console. MB: So, obviously small form factor systems like this limit your ability to modify or upgrade as time goes on and hardcore gamers are probably not your target market for this sort of thing. But for a casual gamer like myself, and someone who lives in a small apartment where space is at a premium, the idea of having a versatile living room PC that can play some AAA gaming titles at good frame rates is very attractive. This is more of a niche product. It’s definitely something that can be attractive for casual gamers, and it can be viewed as more of a secondary PC that you can put in your living room–a PC-based console alternative. For many people, it wouldn’t necessarily be a primary system, but if you’re a hardcore gamer and you have your big, gaming rig in your office or spare bedroom–having one of these Skull Canyons and a big TV in you living room is pretty unbeatable for local multiplayer party games. Going over to a friend’s place and having a game system for a group gaming session is something that a lot of people enjoy, and the PC can offer a lot of options that a console can’t. There are also other folks looking at this for video processing as it offers pretty competitive performance, especially when considering this form factor. While it doesn’t have a big hard drive in it, it can support 2 M.2 blazing fast NVMe SSDs (today shipping at 512GB sizes) that can be raided if desired. And in addition, with Thunderbolt 3 you can add virtually unlimited external storage over a 40Gbps bus–adding a lot of versatility. Skull Canyon Intel® NUC MB: But at the core of the project, you really see this as being a great product for game developers? Absolutely. We’d like to think game developers will see this as a pretty exciting, fairly high-end performance system. It doesn’t necessarily represent tens of millions of users as an install base for them if they’re targeting it, however, with the lead times that big studios have, and some indies, if they’re targeting this type of performance and hardware today, we’ll see that type of performance in more mainstream products in the future. Every year our performance gets better. What you can buy on a 15w Ultrabook today would have been extremely high end in terms of integrated graphics in desktop parts a few generations ago–what you see with this NUC will be commonplace in a few years. We think the opportunity is really nice for developers and users are going to get a good experience out of this. Skull Canyon Intel® NUC MB: So, by looking at the technology in this generation of NUC, developers will have great insight into the next generation of integrated graphics that we’ll see in mass-market consumer products in the near future? Right. We think that Skull Canyons are one of the most exciting pieces of hardware to come out of this generation. The performance that they’ll see out of it will be really exciting, and by making sure that their games work really well on Intel integrated graphics means, downstream, they’ll have access to a larger install base of end users who will be able to play these games. For end users, we think people that use this will approach it as something of a console-like experience, for living room gaming, local multiplayer party style games, or just delivering a console-like experience on a big screen. What we’re doing is two sides of the same coin. On the one hand, this is great for game developers to create great content that will run on the machine, but on the other side we want consumers to enjoy the content that the developers are making. The Skull Canyon may just be a glimpse into the future of small form factor PCs with discrete GPUs becoming a viable alternative to big, hulking gaming rigs for a generation of casual gamers.

Corrales Comment News Reporting as if Democracy Matters Home Welcome to Corrales Comment Publication Dates Subscribe CC Advertise! Ad Rates Archived Articles CALENDAR COP21 Reporting From Paris Intel Explains Goals for 2020 Details Published: 24 August 2016 Microchip production at the Intel plant between Corrales and Rio Rancho continued at 93.5 percent of capacity during July and August, with no definitive statement from corporate officials whether the facility here will close or keep churning out chips. Amid substantial worldwide layoffs this spring, Intel New Mexico has consistently maintained similar high levels of production while corporate leaders chart a course into an uncertain future. Last month at Intel’s Community Environmental Working Group meeting in the Corrales Senior Center, Intel Rio Rancho Site Manager Mindy Koch explained the corporation’s environmental goals to be achieved by 2020. Her presentation also included its Corporate Social Responsibility Report.  At no point in her power point talk did she hint that the plant here might, or might not, be operating by 2020. The goals enumerated were corporation wide, across all manufacturing, research and administrative facilities, she said, adding that the Intel site here is expected to help meet several of those.  Perhaps the only indicator given for Intel’s future here came when Koch explained that operations here substantially reduced energy consumption by shutting down one of the site’s two utility plants earlier this year. The utillity plants house diesel-powered boilers, generators and other equipment. For Corrales residents concerned about chemical emissions from Intel’s manufacturing processes, perhaps the most important goal for 2020 was screening and selecting “green chemistry” production line gases and liquids. The stated goal: “Implement an enhanced green chemistry screening and selection process for 100 percent of new chemicals and gases by 2020.” Koch said the next step is to develop and pilot a screening tool to evaluate chemicals. The deciding factors are effectiveness in the manufacturing process and the best outcome for envisionmental sustainability. But, she pointed out, decisions on which chemicals to use are made at Intel headquarters, not in Rio Rancho.  Another goal for 2020 is to reduce direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 10 percent compared to 2010. She said much of that would come from more efficient use of the factories’ combustion equipment, such as boilers and gas-fired incinerators to burn off waste volatile organic compounds. (See Corrales Comment Vol.XXXIV No.20 December 5, 2015 “Greenhouse Gases From Intel Not Now Regulated.”) Draft minutes of the July CEWG meeting indicate Koch did not specifically mention reducing the industrial chemical emissions that release considerably more potent greenhouse gases than carbon. Instead, she said intended reductions in Intel’s GHG are tied to the kind of energy being used there. “As part of our 2015 Climate Change Pledge, we committed to two new goals,” Koch said, “to continue our support of green power purchasing and triple our use of on-site alternative energy by 2020.” Another goal called for Intel worldwide to “achieve cumulative energy savings of four billion kilowatt/hours  from  2012 to 2020. Locally, some of that would be done by “taking large compressors and capturing waste heat to introduce heat into hot water loops used for heating purposes, rather than generating steam.” Koch said Intel’s goal is to “reduce water use on a per unit basis below the 2010 level by 2020.” She said that would be difficult companywide because Intel’s latest  manufacturing technology uses more water. But for the same reason, Intel New Mexico will help meet that goal, where, she said, its facilities “conserved over 12 million gallons of water in 2015.” Among other goals, Intel will try to recycle 90 percent of its nonhazardous waste by 2020.   Prev Next CREATE A LOGIN ACCOUNT Please take a moment to create account for full, free access to the website.

Intel Sends In A Second Batch Of Graphics Driver Updates For Linux 4.9 Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 24 August 2016 at 09:22 AM EDT. 8 Comments Earlier this month Intel submitted their first batch of i915 DRM driver updates to DRM-Next that in turn is now targeting the Linux 4.9 kernel. A second batch of new feature material was submitted today. The latest batch of Intel DRM driver changes that are now queued up for in turn landing with Linux 4.9 include atomic mode-setting fixes, GuC submission improvements, GGTT improvements, prep work for multi-plane framebuffers, GEM tracking changes, tuning to the command parser, frame-buffer compression changes, and other low-level graphics driver changes. Much of this work was led by Intel's Chris Wilson with being responsible for 102 of the patches while the other developers were responsible for just about 40 of these patches. A complete list of changes can be found via this dri-devel message. Expect more Intel DRM material to still land in the weeks ahead for hitting the Linux 4.9 merge window. 8 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Credit: Lucas Zallio More like this Android Studio for beginners, Part 3: Build and run the app Android Studio for beginners, Part 2: Explore and code the app Choosing your Java IDE For a few years now it's been clear that Android dominates the mobile OS landscape. This Java-based technology has sparked a new gold rush, with programmers competing to make money from their mobile apps. Android jobs are also plentiful, as shown by a quick job search using Indeed.com. To be successful, Android developers need a good grasp of the Java language, Android APIs, and Android app architecture. It's also essential to use an appropriate and effective development environment. For many years, Eclipse IDE with the ADT plugin was the preferred platform for Android development. Today it's Android Studio. If you're new to Android Studio, this tutorial series will get you started. I'll briefly introduce the Android development platform, then show you how to download, install, and run the software. After that, we'll spend most of our time actually using Android Studio to develop an animated mobile app. In Part 1 you'll start up your first Android project and get to know the project workspace in Android Studio. In Part 2 you'll code the app, learning how to use Android Studio to enter source code and resources into the project. Finally, in Part 3 we'll build and run the app using both an emulated hardware device and an Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7" tablet. After you're comfortable with developing a basic mobile app in Android Studio, we'll explore more advanced topics like debugging, performance monitoring, and profiling with Android Studio. We'll also look at extending Android Studio with three useful plugins. Get started with Android Studio Android Studio is Google's officially supported IDE for developing Android apps. Based on IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio is freely available under Apache License 2.0. The most recent stable version, 2.1.1, includes the following features: A unified environment where you can develop for all Android devices. Support for building Android TV apps and Android Wear apps. Template-based wizards to create common Android designs and components. A rich layout editor that lets users drag-and-drop user interface components, and that offers an option to preview layouts on multiple screen configurations. Android-specific refactoring and quick fixes. Gradle-based build support. Lint tools to catch performance, usability, version compatibility, and other problems. ProGuard integration and app-signing capabilities. A fast and feature-rich emulator. Instant Run to push changes to your running app without building a new APK (Application PacKage Zip file). Built-in support for Google Cloud Platform, enabling integration with Google Cloud Messaging and App Engine. C++ and NDK support. Plugin architecture for extending Android Studio via plugins. Download Android Studio Google provides Android Studio for the Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux platforms. You can download this software from the Android Studio homepage. (You'll also find the traditional SDKs, with Android Studio's command-line tools, available from the Downloads page.) Before downloading Android Studio, make sure your platform meets one of the following requirements: Windows OS Microsoft Windows 7/8/10 (32-bit or 64-bit) 2 GB RAM minimum, 8 GB RAM recommended 2 GB of available disk space minimum, 4 GB Recommended (500 MB for IDE + 1.5 GB for Android SDK and emulator system image) 1280 x 800 minimum screen resolution JDK 8 For accelerated emulator: 64-bit operating system and Intel processor with support for Intel VT-x, Intel EM64T (Intel 64), and Execute Disable (XD) Bit functionality Mac OS Mac OS X 10.8.5 or higher, up to 10.11.4 (El Capitan) 2 GB RAM minimum, 8 GB RAM recommended 2 GB of available disk space minimum, 4 GB Recommended (500 MB for IDE + 1.5 GB for Android SDK and emulator system image) 1280 x 800 minimum screen resolution JDK 6 Linux OS GNOME or KDE desktop: Tested on Ubuntu 12.04, Precise Pangolin (64-bit distribution capable of running 32-bit applications) 64-bit distribution capable of running 32-bit applications GNU C Library (glibc) 2.11 or later 2 GB RAM minimum, 8 GB RAM recommended 2 GB of available disk space minimum, 4 GB Recommended (500 MB for IDE + 1.5 GB for Android SDK and emulator system image) 1280 x 800 minimum screen resolution JDK 8 For accelerated emulator: Intel processor with support for Intel VT-x, Intel EM64T (Intel 64), and Execute Disable (XD) Bit functionality, or AMD processor with support for AMD Virtualization (AMD-V) Once you've ensured your operating system is compatible with Android Studio 2.1.1, download the appropriate Android Studio distribution file. The Android Studio download page auto-detected that I'm running 64-bit Windows 8.1 and selected android-studio-bundle-143.2821654-windows.exe for me to download. Bundled installer and Android SDK android-studio-bundle-143.2821654-windows.exe includes an installer and the Android SDK. Alternatively, I could have downloaded a distribution file without the installer and without the SDK. Installing Android Studio on 64-bit Windows 8.1 I launched android-studio-bundle-143.2821654-windows.exe to start the installation process. The installer responded by presenting the Android Studio Setup dialog box shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Set up Android Studio Clicking Next took me to the following dialog box, which gives you the option to decline installing the Android SDK (included with the installer) and an Android Virtual Device (AVD). Figure 2. Do you want to install the Android SDK and AVD? I chose to keep the default settings. After clicking Next, you'll be taken to the license agreement dialog box. Accept the license to continue the installation. Figure 3. Accept the license agreement to continue installation The next dialog box invites you to change the installation locations for Android Studio and the Android SDK. Figure 4. Set the Android Studio and Android SDK installation locations  Change the location or accept the default locations and click Next. The installer defaults to creating a shortcut for launching this program, or you can choose to decline. I recommend that you create the shortcut, then click the Install button to begin installation. Figure 5. Create a new shortcut for Android Studio  The resulting dialog box shows the progress of installing Android Studio and the Android SDK. Clicking the Show Details button will let you view detailed information about the installation progress. The dialog box will inform you when installation has finished. When you click Next, you should see the following: Figure 6. Leave the Start Android Studio check box checked to run this software To complete your installation, leave the Start Android Studio box checked and click Finish. Running Android Studio Android Studio presents a splash screen when it starts running: Figure 7. Android Studio's start screen On your first run, you'll be asked to respond to several configuration-oriented dialog boxes. The first dialog box focuses on importing settings from any previously installed version of Android Studio. Figure 8. Import settings If you're like me, and don't have a previously installed version, you can just keep the default setting and click OK. Android Studio will respond with a slightly enhanced version of the splash screen, followed by the Android Studio Setup Wizard dialog box: Figure 9. Validate your Android SDK and development environment setup When you click Next, the setup wizard invites you to select an installation type for your SDK components. For now I recommend you keep the default standard setting. Figure 10. Choose an installation type Click Next and verify your settings, then click Finish to continue. Figure 11. Review settings The wizard will download and unzip various components. Click Show Details if you want to see more information about the archives being downloaded and their contents. Figure 12. The wizard downloads and unzips Android Studio components If your computer isn't Intel based, you might get an unpleasant surprise after the components have completely downloaded and unzipped: Figure 13. Intel-based hardware acceleration is unavailable Your options are to either put up with the slow emulator or use an Android device to speed up development. I'll discuss the latter option later in the tutorial. Finally, click Finish to complete the wizard. You should see the Welcome to Android Studio dialog box: Figure 14. Welcome to Android Studio  You'll use this dialog to start up a new Android Studio project, work with an existing project, and more. You can access it anytime by double-clicking the Android Studio shortcut on your desktop. Your first Android Studio mobile app The quickest way to get to know Android Studio is to use it to develop an app. We'll start with a variation on the "Hello, World" application: a little mobile app that displays a "Welcome to Android" message. In the steps that follow, you'll start a new Android Studio project and get to know the project workspace, including the project editor that you'll use to code the app in Part 2. Starting a new project From our setup so far, you should still have Android Studio running with the Welcome to Android Studio dialog box. From here, click Start a new Android Studio project. Android Studio will respond with the Create New Project dialog box shown in Figure 15. Figure 15. Create a new project  Enter W2A (Welcome to Android) as the application name and javajeff.ca as the company domain name. You should then see C:\Users\jeffrey\AndroidStudioProjects\W2A as the project location. Click Next to select your target devices. Figure 16. Select your target device categories  Android Studio lets you select form factors, or categories of target devices, for every app you create. I would have preferred to keep the default API 15: Android 4.0.3 (IceCreamSandwich) minimum SDK setting (under Phone and Tablet), which is supported by my Amazon Kindle Fire HD tablet. Because Android Studio doesn't currently support this API level (even when you add the 4.0.3 system image via the SDK Manager), I changed this setting to API 14: Android 4.0 (IceCreamSandwich), which is also supported by my tablet. Click Next, and you will be given the opportunity to choose a template for your app's main activity. For now we'll stick with Empty Activity. Select this template and click Next. Figure 17. Specify an activity template Next you'll customize the activity: Figure 18. Customize your activity Enter W2A as the activity name and main as the layout name, and click Finish to complete this step. Android Studio will respond that it is creating the project, then take you to the project workspace. Figure 19. Android Studio workspace The project workspace is organized around a menu bar, a tool bar, a work area, additional components that lead to more windows (such as a Gradle Console window), and a status bar. Also note the Tip of the Day dialog box, which you can disable if you like. Accessing AVD Manager or SDK Manager from menu and tool bar To access the traditional AVD Manager or SDK Manager, select Android from the Tools menu followed by AVD Manager or SDK Manager from the resulting pop-up menu (or click their tool bar icons). The project and editor windows When you enter the project workspace, W2A is identified as the current project, but you won't immediately see the project details. After a few moments, these details will appear in two new windows. Figure 20. The project and editor windows The project window is organized into a tree whose main branches are App and Gradle Scripts. The App branch is further organized into manifests, java, and res subbranches: manifests stores AndroidManifest.xml, which is an XML file that describes the structure of an Android app. This file also records permission settings (where applicable) and other details about the app. java stores an app's Java source files according to a package hierarchy, which is ca.javajeff.w2a in this example. res stores an app's resource files, which are organized into drawable, layout, mipmap, and values subbranches: drawable: an initially empty location in which to store an app's artwork layout: a location containing an app's layout files; initially, main.xml (the main activity's layout file) is stored here mipmap: a location containing various ic_launcher.png files that store launcher screen icons of different resolutions values: a location containing colors.xml, dimens.xml, strings.xml, and styles.xml The Gradle Scripts branch identifies various .gradle (such as build.gradle) and .properties (such as local.properties) files that are used by the Gradle-based build system. Branch names and directory/file names Each branch/sub-branch corresponds to a directory name or to a file name. For example, res corresponds to the res directory and strings.xml corresponds to the strings.xml file. Conclusion to Part 1 You've installed and configured Android Studio and created a project for your first Android Studio mobile app; now you're ready to build your Android application. In Android Studio, this means populating your new project with Java source code and resource files for a mobile app. Turn to Part 2 when you're ready to get started with your first Android animated mobile app. Related: Java Android Developer Mobile Mobile Java Development Tools Google Jeff Friesen teaches Java technology (including Android) to everyone.

Aubinator Added To Mesa To Help Intel Driver Developers Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 24 August 2016 at 08:59 AM EDT. 1 Comment The Aubinator tool has been added to the Mesa tree for helping Intel graphics driver developers debug problems. Aubinator is a tool for reading AUB files dumped by the Intel driver and via intel_aubdump in the Intel GPU Tools package. There's been the AUB file support present in Mesa for a few years while now Aubinator as a tool for dealing with these files is being added to the Mesa source tree. The commit adding Aubinator explains, "The Aubinator tool is designed to help the driver developers in debugging the driver functionality by decoding the data in the .aub files." So nothing exciting for end-users, but will hopefully help open-source developers in figuring out Intel's graphics driver troubles. 1 Comment Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Miller August 23, 2016 10 Comments Probably the biggest news at the Intel Developer Forum last week was the company's plans for 10nm production, and particularly that the company would now be offering access to ARM's Artisan physical IP. From a manufacturing point of view, probably the biggest news at the Intel Developer Forum last week was the company's plans for 10nm production, and particularly that the company would now be offering access to ARM's Artisan physical IP. The latter is important because it shows that third-parties who use Intel's 10nm process will have access to the most advanced ARM Cortex cores and related technologies. Intel announced that LG Electronics would be its first 10nm customer; it plans to build a mobile platform based on the Intel process. This indicates that Intel intends to compete more with TSMC, Samsung, and GlobalFoundries in making ARM-based mobile processors. The announcement came from Zane Ball, general manager of Intel Custom Foundry. I found that quite interesting, but I was equally intrigued by a presentation he and Intel Senior Fellow Mark Bohr gave on the company's advanced technologies. Bohr discussed the progress Intel has made in 10nm production, saying the company is planning on volume shipments of its first 10nm products in the second half of next year. More interestingly, he said that for its 10nm process the company is getting its historical improvements in transistor gate pitch scaling, and is actually seeing better logic transistor area scaling (which it defines as gate pitch times logic cell height), than it has historically been able to do each generation. Bohr said that as scaling has slowed at some of its competitors, Intel's 10nm technology could be almost a full generation ahead of the 10nm processes of the other foundries. (Part of this is a naming question, as the foundries are using the names 14nm, 16nm and 10nm even though that measurement doesn't refer to a specific part of the process anymore. Note that TSMC and Samsung are now both promising that their 10nm processes will be ready next year, whereas historically they have been behind Intel. We won't really be able to see how good the processes are until real products are available, of course.) It's been clear that the time between nodes seems to be extending, with the "tick-tock" cadence of a new process now every two years, with microarchitecture changes in between no longer applying. Intel has previously announced that it would be shipping a third generation of 14nm CPUs this year (Kaby Lake, following Skylake and Broadwell). Bohr said the company has a "14+" process that provides a 12 percent process performance increase. He also suggested that the 10nm process would actually come in three types, supporting new products over time. Bohr also talked about how the 10nm process would support a variety of features, including transistors designed for high-performance, low leakage, high voltage, or analog designs, and with a variety of interconnect options. The company hasn't disclosed real performance numbers for the next 14nm chip expected later this year, known as Kaby Lake; and has said even less for the 10nm version expected next year, known as Cannonlake. It's good to see progress coming, but certainly it's a slowdown from the pace we once expected. At Intel Developer Forum in 2013, the company said it would have 10nm chips going into production in 2015, and 7nm following in 2017. One thing holding technology back is the lack of successful deployment of EUV lithography systems. EUV is capable of drawing finer lines because it uses light with a smaller wavelength than traditional 193nm immersion lithography. But to date, EUV systems haven't been successfully deployed for volume manufacturing, leading to more double-patterning of traditional lithography, which adds both steps and complexity. Bohr has noted that EUV will not be ready for 10nm production, and said Intel is developing its 7nm process to be compatible with either all traditional immersion lithography processes (with even more multi-patterning required) or with EUV at some layers. He recently told Semiconductor Engineering that the issues with EUV are uptime and wafers per hour, and said if EUV could resolve those issues, manufacturing could be done at a lower total cost. At a panel at the conference, Bohr noted that the number of immersion layers is increasing at a dramatic pace, and said he hopes and expects that at 7nm, EUV can replace or slow down the growth of immersion layers.

Wildfire primarily spreads through Dutch spam emails from transport companies, targeted at Dutch speakers, fooling them with a notice of a ‘missed’ delivery and steps for scheduling a new delivery by filling in a ‘special form’ attached to the message. This form is nothing more than an obfuscated dropper which infects the victim with ransomware, demanding the sum of 1.5 bitcoins to unlock their files. The group behind the ransomware netted US$79,481 (£60,240, A$104,399) in the last month by infecting 5309 systems, Intel Security chief technology officer Raj Samani and advanced threat researcher Christiaan Beek found. "The actors behind Wildfire have clearly put a lot of effort into making their spam mails look credible and very specific," they said. What’s more, like other ransomware types such as CryptoWall, Wildfire does not encrypt victims from a certain set of countries; a strong indicator that an Eastern European group could be responsible, says Intel. However, victims now have the means to unlock their data without having to part with their cash, with researchers making available an initial 1600 keys for Wildfire (with more to come) as part of the NoMoreRansom effort. “With ransomware being the most devastating type of malware currently doing the rounds any decrease in its activity is a great thing,” said Mark James, security specialist at ESET. “Always be very wary of email attachments and links from unknown sources," he added. "If you are unfortunate enough to be infected with ransomware and do not have a current backup to restore from then make sure you check around to see if public decryption keys are available."

The PC market rose in Q2 from the previous quarter, but declined from the same quarter last year, largely due to data center and servers. Some PC suppliers are seeing growth in hope 2-in-1 systems and gaming desktops and notebooks, they hope this will offset the slow down the in PC shipments. While there are high ASP systems, however the two segments combined can only contribute around 10 million unit shipments a year, less than the decline of the total PC market. Overall GPU shipments (rounded up) decreased -4% from last quarter, AMD decreased -1% Nvidia decreased -20% and Intel, decreased -1% Year-to-year total GPU shipments decreased -10%, desktop graphics decreased -6%, notebooks decreased -12%. Graphics processors, stand-alone discrete devices, and embedded processor-based GPUs are ubiquitous and essential components in all systems and devices today from handheld mobile devices, PCs, and workstations, to TVs, servers, vehicle systems, signage, game consoles, medical equipment, and wearables. New technologies and semiconductor manufacturing processes are taking advantage of the ability of GPU power to scale. The GPU drives the screen of every device we encounter-it is the human-machine interface. The second quarter is typically down in the seasonality cycles of the past. For Q2'16 we saw it decrease -4.0% from last quarter, and was below the ten-year average of 2.44%. Quick highlights AMD's overall unit shipments decreased -1.41% quarter-to-quarter, Intel's total shipments decreased -0.74% from last quarter, and Nvidia's decreased -20.01%. The attach rate of GPUs (includes integrated and discrete GPUs) to PCs for the quarter was 132% which was down -7% from last quarter. Discrete GPUs were in 27.78% of PCs, which is down -4.94%. The overall PC market increased 1.06% quarter-to-quarter, and decreased -5.83% year-to-year. Desktop graphics add-in boards (AIBs) that use discrete GPUs decreased -20.81% from last quarter, reflecting seasonality and the clearing out of inventory from older models and Nvidia introduced several new boards in Q2. Q2'16 saw a decrease in tablet shipments from last quarter. GPUs are traditionally a leading indicator of the market, since a GPU goes into every system before it is shipped, and most of the PC vendors are guiding cautiously for Q3'16. Once again, the Gaming PC segment, where higher-end GPUs are used, was a bright spot in the market in the quarter. One thing to note, the Gaming PC segment, where higher-end GPUs are used, continues to deliver growth for PC makers. New gaming content and the promise of Virtual Reality help drive the demand for gaming desktops and notebooks. The quarter in general AMD's shipments of desktop heterogeneous GPU/CPUs, i.e., APUs, for desktops decreased -22.2% from the previous quarter. AMD's shipments were down -0.4% in notebooks. Desktop discrete GPUs increased 4.03% from last quarter, and notebook discrete shipments decreased -3.7%. AMD's total PC graphics shipments decreased -1.4% from the previous quarter. Intel's desktop processor embedded graphics (EPGs) shipments decreased from last quarter by -4.5% and notebook processors increased by 1.4%, and total PC graphics shipments decreased -0.7% from last quarter. Nvidia's desktop discrete GPU shipments were down -28.15% from last quarter; and the company's notebook discrete GPU shipments decreased -5.7%, and total PC graphics shipments decreased -20.0% from last quarter. Total discrete GPUs (desktop and notebook) shipments decreased -14.19% from the last quarter, and decreased -1.03% from last year. Sales of discrete GPUs fluctuate due to a variety of factors (timing, memory pricing, etc.), new product introductions, and the influence of integrated graphics. Overall, the CAGR from 2014 to 2017 is now -8%. Ninety-nine percent of Intel's non-server processors have graphics, and over 66% of AMD's non-server processors contain integrated graphics; AMD still ships integrated graphics chipsets (IGPs).

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter China is one of the world’s largest consumers of semiconductor devices thanks to its manufacturing might, and is planning to spend more than $100 billion to become also a premier supplier to the planet. The global consultancy estimates that by 2020, almost 55 percent of the world’s memory, logic and analog chips will flow to or through the country. But the vast majority of the microchips that act as the brains of products like Apple Inc.’s iPhone are largely imported from companies like Intel Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co. The government in 2014 moved to change this with plans to invest more than $100 billion and become a leading global player. It’s also driven consolidation among domestic suppliers to maximize its investments, including the $2.8 billion merger of Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. and Wuhan Xinxin Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. announced last month. China’s effort to build a world-leading semiconductor industry is part of a broader effort to wean itself off foreign technology. But financial investment will not be enough to buy leadership of the semiconductor sector, which is worth around $1 trillion according to Singapore-based Bain partner Kevin Meehan. The country currently makes just 15 percent of the semiconductors it consumes, Bain said in a report. And by 2020, the consultancy expects Chinese-based plants to produce just 7 percent of the world’s microchips, barely up from current levels. “China is coming at it in a pretty smart and intelligent way,” he said. “But I don’t see a path for them to own leading-edge processor technology and that is the foundation of Intel, the foundation of Samsung’s success.” To read a Gadfly column on China’s evolving chip industry, click here. Efforts by Chinese companies to buy rivals with intellectual property in the processor and memory markets have run afoul of regulators around the world. Plans for a $3.8 billion investment in Western Digital Corp. were scrapped amid a U.S. security review and investments in Taiwanese chip companies face regulatory obstacles and have stoked political tension. “Assuming they can spend it all, the biggest risk is that they end up with a whole bunch of fragmented and weak follower positions,” Meehan said. “There’s ways for them to have influence over greater than 10 percent if they’re partnering well, but otherwise I think you’re essentially capped there.” Meehan said China’s semiconductor makers could eventually learn from partnerships with global giants and become one of the larger suppliers of key components like computer memory. Both Intel and Qualcomm Inc. have agreed to build semiconductor fabrication plants there in partnership with local providers. “If you take a long view -- not five years but decades -- then certainly you’d have to believe there’s some absorption,” he said. "But people are careful not to put their leading edge IP in China.” “I don’t see a way to get there without licensing or buying.” (A previous version of the story corrected the amount that China supplies the world) Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

This year has a number of talks about power management, upcoming IBM CPUs, upcoming Intel CPUs, upcoming NVIDIA SoCs and the final talk of the final day is from AMD, discussing Zen in even more depth than the previous week. While we were unable to attend the event in person, we managed to get some hands on time with information and put questions to Mike Clark, AMD Senior Fellow and design engineer. What We Learned Last Week: L1/L2/L3 Caches and the Micro-Op Buffer In AMD’s initial presentation for the general media, we were given a sense of the microarchitecture layout. We covered the material, but it contained a number of highlights. AMD Zen Microarchitecture: Dual Schedulers, Micro-op Cache and Memory Hierarchy Revealed AMD Server CPUs and Motherboard Analysis Unpacking AMD's Zen Benchmark: Is Zen actually 2% Faster than Broadwell? First up, and the most important, was the announcement of the inclusion of a micro-op cache. This allows for instructions that are frequently used to be closer to the micro-op queue and saves a trip through the core and caches to load the desired information. Typically micro-op caches are still relatively small, and while AMD isn’t giving any information for size and accessibility, we know that Intel’s version can support 1536 uOps with 8-way associativity; we expect AMD’s to be similar though there are many options in play. Secondly is the cache structure. We were given details for the L1, L2 and L3 cache sizes, along with associativity, to compare it to former microarchitectures as well as Intel’s offering. CPU Cache Comparison   Zen HEDT Bulldozer HEDT Excavator   Skylake Broadwell HEDT L1-I 64KB/core 64KB/module 96KB/module 32KB/core 32KB/core 4-way 2-way 3-way 8-way 8-way L1-D 32KB/core 16KB/thread 32KB/thread 32KB/core 32KB/core 8-way 4-way 8-way 8-way 8-way L2 512KB/core 1MB/thread 512KB/thread 256KB/core 256KB/core 8-way 16-way 16-way 4-way 8-way L3 2MB/core 1MB/thread - >2MB/core 1.5-3MB/core 16-way 64-way - 16-way 16/20-way L3 Type Victim Victim - Write-back Write-back In this case, AMD has given Zen a 64KB L1 Instruction cache per core with 4-way associativity, with a lop-sided 32KB L1 Data cache per core with 8-way associativity. The size and accessibility determines how frequently a cache line is missed, and it is typically a trade-off for die area and power (larger caches require more die area, more associativity usually costs power). The instruction cache, per cycle, can afford a 32byte fetch while the data cache allows for 2x 16-byte loads and one 16-byte store per cycle. AMD stated that allowing two D-cache loads per cycle is more representative of the most workloads that end up with more loads than stores. The L2 is a large 512 KB, 8-way cache per core. This is double the size of Intel’s 256 KB 4-way cache in Skylake or 256 KB 8-way cache in Broadwell. Typically doubling the cache size affords a 1.414 (square root of 2) better chance of a cache hit, reducing the need to go further out to find data, but comes at the expense of die area. This will have a big impact on a lot of performance metrics, and AMD is promoting faster cache-to-cache transfers than previous generations. Both the L1 and L2 caches are write-back caches, improving over the L1 write-through cache in Bulldozer. The L3 cache is an 8MB 16-way cache, although at the time last week it was not specified over how many cores this was. From the data release today, we can confirm rumors that this 8 MB cache is split over a four-core module, affording 2 MB of L3 cache per core or 16 MB of L3 cache for the whole 8-core Zen CPU. These two 8 MB caches are separate, so act as a last-level cache per 4-core module with the appropriate hooks into the other L3 to determine if data is needed. As part of the talk today we also learned that the L3 is a pure victim cache for L1/L2 victims, rather than a cache for prefetch/demand data, which tempers the expectations a little but the large L2 will make up for this. We’ll discuss it as part of today’s announcement. The mid-week release also gave insight into the dual schedulers, one for INT and another for FP, which is different to Intel’s joint scheduler/buffer implementation. The talk at Hot Chips goes into detail about how the dispatch and schedulers operate The New Information As part of the Hot Chips presentation, AMD is reaffirming its commitment to at least +40% IPC improvement over Excavator. This has specifically been listed as a throughput goal at an equivalent energy per cycle, resulting in an increase in efficiency. Obviously a number of benefits come from moving the 28nm TSMC process to GloFo’s 14nm FinFET process which is used via a Samsung licence. Both the smaller node and FinFET improvements have been well documented so we won’t go over them here, but AMD is stating that Zen is much more than this as a direct improvement to immediate performance, not just efficiency. While Zen is initially a high-performance x86 core at heart, it is designed to scale all the way from notebooks to supercomputers, or from where the Cat cores (such as Jaguar and Puma) were all the way up to the old Opterons and beyond, all with at least +40% IPC. The first immediate image out of the presentation is the CPU Complex (a CCX), which shows the Zen core design as a four-CPU cluster with caches. This shows the L2/L3 cache breakdown, and also confirms 2MB of L3 per core with 8 MB of L3 per CCX. It also states that the L3 is mostly exclusive of the L2 cache, which stems from the L3 cache as a victim cache for L2 data. AMD is stating that the protocols involved in the L3 cache design allow each core to access the L3 of each other core with an average (but a range) of latencies. Over the next few pages, we’ll go through the slides. They detail more information about the application of Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT), New Instructions, the size of various queues and buffers, the back-end of the design, the front-end of the design, fetch, decode, execute, load/store and retire segments.

POST A COMMENT 104 Comments View All Comments CrazyElf - Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - link If they can really get a 40% improvement over Excavator, and I mean 40% on average, not on a few select benchmarks, then AMD has a serious chance of being a compelling option once again. I'm hoping to see more improvements on Floating Point, which was comically bad in Bulldozer. A big part of the problem is that we don't know how well Zen will clock or the power consumption. Still, this should be a major leap in performance overall. We'll have to wait for the launch day benchmarks to see the true story. Another big concern is the platform. CPU performance is only part of the story. We need a good platform that can rival the Z170 and Intel HEDT platforms for this to be compelling on the desktop. For mobile, there will have to be good dual channel Zen APUs (Carrizo, as Anandtech noted was heavily gimped by poor quality OEM designs obsessed with cost cutting). Reply jabber - Wednesday, August 24, 2016 - link Yeah I don't think OEMs and others are that worried about supporting AMD. AMD have withered away so much, making AMD CPU capable gear must have become a very minor part of say ASUS/Gigabyte/MSI etc. revenue stream. Making AMD based graphics cards is okay but motherboards? Not so much. Reply teuast - Wednesday, August 24, 2016 - link I wouldn't speak so soon. Just this year MSI and Gigabyte (at least) have introduced new AM3+ boards with USB 3.1 and PCIe 3.0. Why, I'm not sure, but if they're doing that for something as old and deprecated as the FX chips, it would defy logic for Zen to come out and for them to only release a few token efforts. I will say, if the CPUs are good but you're right about OEMs not being concerned with support, then the first OEM to say "hey, why don't we make some actually good AM4 boards?" is going to make an absolute killing. Reply h4rm0ny - Thursday, August 25, 2016 - link Are you sure about the PCI-E v3 on AM3+ motherboards? I can find recent releases that have USB3.1 and M.2, but none that support PCI-Ev3. Can you link me or provide a model number? I didn't think 3rd generation PCI-E was possible on the Bulldozer line. Reply SKD007 - Thursday, August 25, 2016 - link SABERTOOTH 990FX/GEN3 R2.0 Reply SKD007 - Thursday, August 25, 2016 - link https://www.asus.com/Motherboards/SABERTOOTH_990FX... Reply Outlander_04 - Thursday, August 25, 2016 - link A little misleading . The Graphics pci-e controller is built in to an FX processor so adding a pci-e 3 standard slot to a motherboard will make no difference to actual bandwidth. Not an issue though since x16 pci-e 2 has the same bandwidth as x8 pci-e 3 and intel boards with SLI/crossfire ability running at x8/x8 do not choke any current graphics card Reply h4rm0ny - Thursday, August 25, 2016 - link What about PCI-E SSDs? Can I get full bandwidth on those? I agree about the graphics cards but that's not so important to me. If I can get full PCI-Ev3 x4 performance for an SSD then I'll pribably buy this as a hold-over until Zen. Thanks fir the link! Reply fanofanand - Friday, August 26, 2016 - link Pci-e 3.0 x4 should be the same as 2.0 x 8. So long as you have a vacant x8 it should theoretically work the same. Reply extide - Wednesday, September 07, 2016 - link I think they use a PLX chip and turn the 32 2.0 lanes from the FX chip into 16 3.0 lanes.

A look at whether such an arrangement makes sense at some point in the future. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Aug 23, 2016 at 7:23PM Image source: Intel.  At microprocessor giant Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) developer forum earlier this month, the company disclosed that it will build a future mobile processor for LG Electronics on the former's upcoming 10-nanometer chip manufacturing technology. Although the financial impact of this deal to Intel is unlikely to be significant for a number of reasons (more on that in a coming column), this has rekindled the following, seemingly age-old question: "Does this mean that Intel will build future A-series processors for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)?" Intel's next shot is in the 2018 iPhone The A10 chip inside the upcoming iPhone 7 and 7 Plus series of smartphones is expected to be manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) on its current-generation 16-nanometer FinFET Plus manufacturing technology. The A10 is expected to be manufactured in TSMC's 10-nanometer manufacturing technology, which should be in mass production a couple of quarters before Intel's own 10-nanometer technology is in production. Intel's next real shot at building the processor for the iPhone, then, would be for the A12 chip that will go inside the 2018 iPhone. The two processes that Apple could use for this product and likely achieve similar performance, power, and area metrics would be Intel's 10-nanometer technology and TSMC's 7-nanometer technology. Going with Intel might be an unnecessary risk for the A12; A13 more likely Apple is certainly fond of supplier diversity and likes to have multiple sources for components to get better pricing on said components. It would be in Apple's best interests to have multiple strong, viable chip manufacturing partners, especially in light of a recent report from Digitimes claiming that Apple dares not try to squeeze TSMC for better pricing since it has reportedly found it "difficult to find alternative sources" to TSMC. That being said, Intel doesn't have a proven track record of being able to ramp up tens of millions of a third party's chip design on a bleeding-edge chip manufacturing technology. TSMC does. Over the long term, Apple may very well choose to go through the work to second-source a design at Intel. However, I wouldn't expect Apple to risk it with the A12. I could see Apple giving Intel a shot for the A13 for the 2019 iPhone. By then, Apple will have gotten to see how Intel handled the production ramp-up of LG's upcoming 10-nanometer chip, and Intel's 10-nanometer process should be quite mature. It will have been in production for about a year-and-a-half when it comes time to ramp up the A13. If Intel shows it can deliver on being a world-class contract manufacturer for third-party chipmakers, then I could see Apple giving Intel a minority allocation of the A13, on perhaps 20% to 30% of the orders. This has to be what Intel is gunning for At the end of the day, the only potential foundry deal in the mobile market that would truly be worth all of the investment that Intel seems to be making into its contract chip manufacturing business would be a win at Apple. Winning, and sustaining, business at Apple would drive both significant unit volumes as well as non-trivial revenues. It would also, in my view, drive improved execution at the chipmaker in terms of ramping up new manufacturing technologies. If Intel can win the Apple business, losing it in future generations would be painful, so this could potentially light a fire under Intel to really succeed. Not only would improved execution help Intel try to hang on to business with Apple, but it would accelerate the pace of manufacturing innovation at Intel as a whole, which would help improve the competitiveness of all of Intel's product lines -- PCs, servers, and the Internet of Things. Whether Intel can ultimately win Apple -- and, if it does, whether it can keep it -- as a foundry customer remains to be seen. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Over the last 20+ year's he's helped numerous business see the benefit in adopting a wide range of Open Source technologies, and  has spoken at a number of regional and international conferences including OSDC, linux.conf.au, OpenStack Summit, Linux World and OSCON. In his spare time he still hacks on MythTV, and debugging random new bits of hardware that really should » More about me Learn how you can contribute Almost open: BIOS and firmware update tips for Linux users Posted 23 Aug 2016 Steven Ellis (Red Hat)Feed 49up 7 comments Image credits :  Original photo by Rikki Endsley. CC BY-SA 4.0 I suppose I'm lucky in that for more than 10 years my primary work environment has been Linux-based, yet all to often I've been forced to dig out a DOS or Windows image because I need to patch some BIOS device firmware. These days I don't own anything that has a valid Windows license, and even my 2008 white MacBook has spent most of its life running either Ubuntu or Fedora. Luckily most hardware manufacturers have started to provide bootable images for patching system firmware, and for enterprise-grade hardware they even provide Linux-ready tools. In this article, I'll walk through my recent firmware update on Linux, and I'll share a few recommendations based on that experience. In the consumer/prosumer landscape there has been a shift toward UEFI-based systems for desktops and laptops, and along the way many manufacturers appear to have removed the option for the BIOS to update from a USB Stick. Historically we'd only see firmware updates for enterprise-class spinning rust (hard drives), but many SSD manufacturers are also providing regular firmware updates for consumer-class devices. Whilst we often should stand by the old adage "If it ain't broke, don't fix it," I'm a strong believer when standing up a new environment to make sure all my firmware is current. So begins my journey... My update adventure For many years I've been involved with the MythTV project (open source DVR), including at one point producing consumer-ready systems in New Zealand (myPVR). Recently I was after an Intel-based compact PC that could operate as a MythTV front-end, was capable of running Kodi (open source theater system), and could also be occasionally re-purposed as a hypervisor for my home lab. I picked up a GIGABYTE BRIX based on a quad-core N3150 processor, and re-purposed spare RAM and hard drives, for a simple and effective solution. The integrated Intel HD Graphics are capable of H265/HEVC at 24 frames/second, plus the CPU has VT for hardware accelerated virtualization (sadly only upgradable to 8GB RAM, but enough for a simple testbed). With any new equipment, my first step is to try a live USB image to test the hardware. I have a number of bootable images on hand, including Fedora, Ubuntu, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and these days I tend toward a 64-bit image for testing as ultimately I'll be running a 64-bit operating system. I also confirmed that the system was set up with VT enabled for hardware accelerated virtualization as a surprising number of systems still ship with this setting disabled in BIOS or UEFI.   Great tools at this point within a live image are dmidecode and lspci to pull firmware and hardware information:

 The only device I'm expecting to have potential issues with is the Realtek 522a-based MicroSD card reader. All other devices are well supported by modern Linux distributions. Looking at GIGABYTE's site confirmed a new firmware update for the UEFI-based BIOS, which resolves some issues with USB devices and selected monitors. Given one of my primary use cases is as an HTPC, good monitor support is critical, so it was time to update. A quick check of the supplied brix_bios_gb-bace-3150_f3.zip update confirmed the lack of Linux tools, and I've never tried a firmware update from the UEFI firmware directly from the UEFI shell. The BIOS-style front end also has no options for updating the firmware. Searching online for AMI UEFI patching pulled up an old Phoronix article for MSI hardware (MSI: Update your BIOS from the Linux desktop) indicating that a tool called afulnx_64 might be an option. Being somewhat wary of patching my system using random tools from file-hosting sites, I discovered that GIGABYTE ship a version of the tool for their rack-mount enterprise focused systems. Let's try out the afulnx_64 executable from the tools folder in the ZIP file provided by GIGABYTE: 
./afulnx_64 
Error: Cannot locate kernel source.
e - Error: Kernel source files cannot be found.
 The tool needs to build a kernel module in order to patch my BIOS. From a security perspective, this is a little worrying, but looks like a better approach than some of the UEFI tools Matthew Garret has spoken about in recent years. In addition there have been a number of recent security vulnerabilities, including one labled ThinkPwn, in the UEFI for a number of key Intel chipsets that has affected producs from Lenovo, Gigabyte, HP and many others. Keeping an eye on new UEFI releases for your hardware might be considerably more critical than the old days of BIOS updates, especially given the power of the UEFI subsystem on modern hardware. Lenovo:  System Management Mode (SMM) BIOS Vulnerability HPSBBHF3549 ThinkPwn UEFI BIOS SmmRuntime Escalation of Privilege The Register: Gigabyte BIOS blight fright At this point I tried looking at truly open alternatives, such as flashrom: $ sudo flashrom --programmer internal -V flashrom v0.9.9-rc1-r1942 on Linux 4.4.0-28-generic (x86_64) flashrom is free software, get the source code at https://flashrom.org flashrom was built with libpci 3.3.1, GCC 5.3.1 20160225, little endian Found Macronix flash chip "MX25U6435E/F" (8192 kB, SPI). This chip may contain one-time programmable memory. flashrom cannot read and may never be able to write it, hence it may not be able to completely clone the contents of this chip (see man page for details). No operations were specified. Restoring MMIO space at 0x7fc38d7470fc Not looking good so back to the afulnx_64 tool . Luckily, most live USB images will let you install additional packages, so I pulled in the kernel headers and tried afulnx_64 again. I couldn't get this to work with Ubuntu 14.04 or 16.04, but it did work with RHEL 7.2 Being paranoid about my new hardware I first checked the current bios install to confirm that the tool "appears to work":

 Well that was about two months ago, and the hardware has been performing perfectly since. Recommendations More vendors should allow UEFI BIOS updates directly from the BIOS-style interface. UEFI shell command-line isn't for the casual user. If your vendor supplies a bootable image, try to use that first. Investigate what supported tools are available, but consider using a live image for patching. I'm somewhat wary of tools that build and install their own kernel modules. Assist projects—like flashrom—to avoid these issues in the future. In my next article, I'll share the fun of patching SSD firmware.

My Gigabyte board also supports the following firmware update procedure: copy firmware file to a DOS/WinVFat formatted USB stick, boot the box and immediately press a Hotkey (iirc it's F2) and then let the built-in BIOS update feature grab the new firmware version from the USB stick and initiate the update process. Hope this helps. Vote up! 0 Vote down! 0 Steven Ellis on 16 Oct 2016 Permalink I've got several older motherboards that still support BIOS updated via F2 or similar Hot Keys.

The annual Intel Developer Forum usually gives us a glimpse into the chipmaker's plans for new PC and server processors, as well as a look at how the company plans to actually make the next generation of chips. There was a bit of that at last week's show – including a preview of the upcoming Kaby Lake generation of Core PC processors and some interesting news on the manufacturing side – but the focus of the show was on other topics, as Intel is trying to be viewed as more than just a PC chipmaker. In the opening keynote, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich did preview the 7th generation Core or Kaby Lake chips, saying Intel hasn't stopped pushing the boundaries of PCs and that powerful microprocessors remain important. (Kaby Lake demos) On stage demonstrations included 4K content using 10-bit HEVC encoding on a 2-in-1, much faster editing of VR content within Epic's Unreal Engine, and playing Blizzard's Overwatch game on a version of the chip with embedded Iris graphics. Like the previous generation Broadwell and Skylake chips from the last generation, this will be based on 14nm technology. I expect we'll hear more in the run up to the IFA conference in the next couple of weeks. But Krzanich's focus was on four themes. He talked about "redefining the experience of computing" with a focus on "merged reality," and unveiled the Project Alloy untethered VR headset. Krzanich discussed "building a world of visual intelligence" while showing the firm's RealSense 3D camera system, featuring a Yuneec Typhoon H drone with Intel RealSense technology, and Project Aero, a platform for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Within this area, he also presented a new device called Euclid that combines compute, sensors, and communications in a system about the size of a candy bar, demoing the device in a robot that could follow you on the stage. This included the RealSense Camera 400, which he said was thinner and smaller, while doubling the range of the system. Krzanich then brought up Elmar Frickenstein, who heads the automated driving group at BMW, to discuss the partnership that Intel, BMW, and Mobileye set up last month to push autonomous vehicle technology. (Krzanich and Immelt) His third point was "a cloud designed for innovation," and Krzanich talked about how even though people are expected to use 1.5 GB of data per day in 2020, autonomous cars will generate 4,000 GB of data every day, and an airplane will create 40,000 GB of data per day. He brought up GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt who talked about the company's vision for digital transformation, saying every industrial company has to become a digital company, as well as how both GE and Intel are using sensors and automation in running their factories. John Gordon, chief digital officer of GE's Current, showed off a lightpole with sensors connected to GE's Predix platform, and Krzanich talked about the importance of collecting and using metadata. In this area, he announced a Curie Knowledge Builder toolkit, which allows on-chip pattern matching so smart devices can identify special movements, like the swing of a tennis racket, without moving the data to the cloud. This will be broadly available in the first half of 2017, he said. (Krzanich and Joule) The final area Krzanich focused on was "empowering the next generation of innovators," and to that end he announced Intel's Joule, a new developer platform for the Internet of Things, which included a small system board with a module that was also shown off in VR glasses. This is shipping in volume in September. (Murthy Renduchintala) Other keynotes followed these directions. Venkata "Murthy" Renduchintala, President of Intel's client and internet of things business and its systems architecture group, followed Krzanich with a keynote that echoed many of the same themes. He particularly focused on 5G technology, and said the exploding amounts of data generated by IoT applications will require new thinking about how the network is architected, and promising Intel would be offering "end-to-end" solutions including work on next generation software-defined networking. Renduchintala brought up a panel of executives from AT&T, NTT DoCoMo, and GE Current to talk about the challenges and opportunities this has created. Examples ranged from better technology for firefighters within a building to better communicate with leaders on the outside, who could have a better picture of the full fire, to getting food trucks to the right places to meet demand. (Diane Bryant and Silicon Photonics) Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of Intel's Data Center Group, also unveiled a number of products. The most attention went to Knights Mill, the next generation of the company's Xeon Phi many-core processor. This adds support for single- and half-precision calculations to the current Knights Landing version, with Bryant talking about how such features are useful for training deep learning systems. This is clearly meant as a shot at Nvidia's Tesla products, which already support single- and half- procession calculations, and thus can do those shorter calculations used in training faster than double-precision ones. She said that today 7% of servers are deployed in support of machine learning, and that Intel powers 97% of such systems (mostly regular Xeon systems). Baidu announced it will use Intel's solutions, including Xeon Phi, and Bryant also mentioned Intel's recent acquisition of machine learning startup Nervana, without giving many details. I thought the bigger technical story was the announcement that the long-promised silicon photonics product is finally ready for shipment. This is currently designed to interconnect racks of servers within a data center, and especially the so-called "east-west" traffic, which is doubling every year. What makes Intel's solution so different is its integration of the indium phosphide laser onto the silicon, which Bryant says allows for the laser to be automatically aligned and more precise than other optical solutions. The initial version will be offered at 100 Gb/second, with Bryant saying this should scale up to 400 Gb/second. Intel has been talking about silicon photonics for a long time – Bryant said the project has taken 16 years – so seeing it ship is a big step. Bryant also announced the availability of Intel's Rack Scale Design, an architecture for managing racks of computers with pooled network, compute, and storage resources. She said Dell, Ericsson, Inspur, and QCT would have such systems available by the end of the year, and I also noted that Supermicro had a system on the show floor it said was compatible. This includes new telemetry for managing the servers. Much of the focus was on software-defined networks and the move to 5G, with Bryant joined by AT&T Chief Strategy Officer John Donovan to talk about an expanded collaboration agreement and how network functions virtualization was changing the networking arena. The third day of the show included more of a focus on FPGAs – field programmable gate arrays – as Intel talked about its acquisition of FPGA maker Altera, now known as Intel's Programmable Systems Group. Krzanich gave a keynote –joined by Dan McNamara, who heads the new group - that focused on FPGAs both as standalone products and as part of packages including Xeon processors. He held up the latest FPGA from the company, the Stratix 10, the first made on Intel's 14nm process. Overall, I was intrigued but not overwhelmed by the products – Kaby Lake sounds like a minor upgrade, but the changes in Xeon Phi, the introduction of silicon photonics, and the greater prominence of FPGAs could be big. Still, it is Intel's attempt to move in new directions that is probably the biggest underlying story.

The platforms support up to 384 GB of DDR4 memory and are based on the good-old Intel C612 PCH. Due to high TDP of Intel’s Knights Landing CPUs, Supermicro had to use a custom closed-loop liquid cooling for its SuperWorkstation SYS-5038K-i. Intel officially launched its Xeon Phi x200 many-core Knights Landing platform in June, but the company disclosed most of the details regarding its new processors last year at Supercomputing15. As discussed, every Xeon Phi x200 in LGA packaging has up to 72 cores (based on highly-modified Atom Silvermont microarchitecture) running at up to 1.5 GHz, with up to 36 MB of L2 cache, 16 GB of on-package high-performance memory (MCDRAM), six-channel DDR4 DRAM controller as well as 36 PCIe 3.0 lanes. The Xeon Phi x200 chips in LGA3647 form-factor can run as a host, directly with an operating system on board (including Windows Server 2016) which is an upgrade over the older Xeon Phi parts which only ran as co-processors on the PCIe bus. Moreover, the internal PCIe 3.0 root complex gives the Xeon Phi some PCIe lanes to allow other coprocessors to be plugged in - either additional Xeon Phi accelerators in the card form-factor, or AMD/NVIDIA cards, to maximize the compute horsepower. SuperServer 5028TK-HTR Since Intel Xeon Phi x200 processors are designed mainly for high performance computing, so as a result the OEM developers that build servers for customers tend to focus their efforts primarily on ultra-dense platforms. One of the first Xeon Phi x200 solutions from Supermicro will be the SuperServer 5028TK-HTR, which packs four hot-swappable half-width nodes based on the company’s K1SPi motherboards into a 2U form-factor. Each 5028TK-HTR sports 12 3.5” hot-swappable SATA/SAS storage devices (three per node) as well as a 2000 W redundant PSU. Meanwhile, the K1SPi carries one P1 socket, six DDR4 DIMM slots (for up to 384 GB of DDR4), two PCIe 3.0 x16 low-profile slots, a PCIe 3.0 x4 slot, an Intel i350 dual port GbE controller, the Aspeed AST2400 BMC platform management. Supermicro’s SuperServer 5028TK-HTR (as well as the K1SPi motherboard) support Intel Xeon Phi x200 processors with up to 250-260 W TDP. Machines supporting Knights Landing models featuring Omni-Path fabric will be announced at a later date. SuperWorkstation 5038K-i While HPC is a very important market for products like Xeon Phi, there is a segment of Xeon Phi clients who use them in desktop environments for financial analysis, oil and gas exploration, simulations as well as other applications. Also, HPC developers typically want a system-under-the-desk to actually develop their software with immediate results. Specifically for them, at the request of Intel, Supermicro introduced its SuperWorkstation 5038K-i desktop machine featuring the company’s K1SPE motherboard. The workstation is a self-contained unit sold complete, with CPU, DRAM, storage, PSU and cooling. The chassis can fit in two 5.25” ODDs (or other peripherals), six 3.5" and four 2.5” storage devices. The tower is equipped with multiple fans and come with one 750W power supply made by Seasonic as well as a custom-made closed-loop liquid cooling system with two 120 mm fans. The K1SPE mainboard features one P1 socket (with eight-phase power delivery), six DDR4 DIMM slots (for up to 384 GB of DDR4), two PCIe 3.0 x16 slots, a PCIe 3.0 x4 slot, 10 SATA connectors, two GbE ports (via Intel i350), an IPMI LAN port, Aspeed AST2400 for graphics and management, USB 3.0 ports and so on. Despite the fact that the K1SPE uses regular ATX form-factor (with ATX12V and EPS12V power connectors), it will not be sold separately. Both SuperServer 5028TK-HTR and SuperWorkstation 5038K-i machines should be available from Supermicro shortly, but only as complete systems. Therefore, their exact pricing could not be determined because it depends completely on exact configurations and quantity. We have been told that the workstation, the 5038K-i, is actually on back order with a number of customers already, however Supermicro is ramping up production as a result. Additional from Ian: We've put in a request for a 5038K-i sample, which will run Windows Server 2016. As it's a full x86 core (with additional VPUs), I want to see how well our regular x86 enterprise workloads translate into the Xeon Phi sphere. With a low single thread frequency but up to 72 cores, this test should be an interesting one.

POST A COMMENT 8 Comments View All Comments ddriver - Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - link Superservers and superworkstations sound oddly childishly named. Curious how the phi would do in traditional workstation (not enterprise) tasks as a main processor. Reply nathanddrews - Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - link My guess is that it would be really slow for the majority of tasks, but be extraordinary at very threaded tasks. Pricing will be the primary consideration, I think. I'm not aware of any workstation applications that benefit from having more than 8-10 cores, so you might be better off with a dual Xeon setup or something so you can get high single threaded performance and probably faster multithreaded performance. (unless your applications use 50 threads...) I'm sure there are applications/scenarios where this excels, I just can't think of any. Can't wait for benchmarks! Reply ddriver - Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - link Well, most demanding tasks in HPC actually scale quite well, almost perfectly. Those usually divide the work and do it in multiple passes. However I am also curious about async massive multithreading scenarios, where scores of thread do their own thing and exchange results rather than working on parts of the same workload. Reply mtroute - Thursday, September 08, 2016 - link Don't expect screen melting geekbench scores. To take advantage of Phi codes need to be optimized considerably. Vectorization, data locality, memory and cache optimization. This is a true parallel processor that with the right code modernization, will melt your screen.. Reply Kevin G - Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - link Yes, I'm eager to see how a high thread count, low IPC platform does across an array of tasks. Even though they're Atom based cores, I'm eager to see if performance is 'good enough' for the per thread aspect while exploiting the massive amount of parallelism for high throughput. Reply ddriver - Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - link "atom based" doesn't mean much in terms of actual performance, at least the kind of performance I am interested in, actually comes from the SIMD units, and this thing has 512bit wide simd while atoms don't even have avx - that is they cap out at sse3, which suggests the simd units are 128bit wide. So while this may have low IPC for scalar, this is by far not the case for vector execution, which matters for practically 100% of the computation intensive tasks. Reply beginner99 - Wednesday, August 24, 2016 - link I would like to have that one and also know some scenarios were it would be great. Now I will have to wait 10 years till software catches up... Reply BlueBlazer - Wednesday, August 24, 2016 - link A review of that workstation would be nice, at least we can see how Intel's Knights Landing actually performs (including workstation and server style workloads).

Despite the name 'workstation', this board is based on the consumer-grade Intel X99 PCH rather than the server oriented parts, and as a result it supports overclocking. Part of the 'Workstation' feature set means that it has qualified support for NVIDIA Quadro PCIe cards, compatibility with ECC memory, and a U.2 connector for storage. The manufacturer claims that the mainboard uses special components that can improve the endurance of the board, although the warranty is still listed as three years. Typically, workstation-class motherboards for Intel Xeon E5 v3/v4 processors in LGA2011-3 packaging are based on the Intel C612 PCH, which has the same I/O features as the desktop-class Intel X99, but also supports a number of additional capabilities, which are important for business environments, such as vPro, RSTe, SVT and so on (you can read more about Intel’s 612 chipset here). When it comes to professional workstation vendors that supply machines to large corporations, those technologies make a lot of sense and are generally welcome. However, for prosumers and for many professionals working in small/medium businesses, these options might not be required, which is why a lot of motherboard manufacturers offer Intel X99-based workstation-class mainboards that fully support overclocking but continue to have numerous workstation features (such as support for ECC, when Xeon CPUs are installed). This is the focus of the X99A Workstation. The MSI X99A Workstation (7A54) motherboard features one LGA2011-3 slot for Intel Core i7 as well as Intel Xeon E5 processors, though it is interesting to note that the maker does not list Intel Xeon SKUs in its qualified vendor list. Along with the eight-phase power delivery (which uses solid-state chokes), the mainboard carries eight DDR4 memory slots that not only support non-ECC/unbuffered memory modules with XMP 2.0 (and up to DDR4-3333 supported in OC modes), but also RDIMMs with ECC with applicable CPUs. For add-in cards, the motherboard has three PCIe 3.0 x16 slots (which can work in x16, x16/x16, x8/x16/x8 modes with CPUs featuring 40 PCIe lanes) as well as two PCIe 2.0 x1 slots from the chipset. When it comes to storage-related capabilities, the MSI X99A Workstation comes with one M.2-22110 slot, one U.2 port running in PCIe 3.0 x4 mode, and a SATAe port (unavailable when M.2 and U.2 are used). For traditional HDDs/SSDs/ODDs, the motherboard offers 10 SATA 6 Gb/s ports (including two ports from SATAe). So, in total the motherboard can support up to 12 storage devices. The chipset diagram shows what is in play, and the M.2 configuration is a little odd given that 2 lanes come from the PCH and another two from the CPU despite standard CPU bifurcation stops at x4. In this instance I would have suggested that MSI merely considers the M.2 a CPU device with x4, given that the system would support it, but because Intel has 28-lane CPUs for the platform this can cause differences in bandwidth available. MSI shared the storage support matrix to help users looking into the X99A Workstation: For audio and networking, the MSI X99A Workstation uses the Realtek ALC1150 solution (with PCB separation and filter caps) with 7.1-channel analog as well as S/PDIF outputs. For networking, the motherboard has an Intel I218LM and an Intel I210AT Gigabit LAN controllers, with teaming support listed. The mainboard also features ASMedia’s ASM1142 controller to enable one USB 3.1 Type-C (10 Gbps) and one USB 3.1 Type-A (10 Gbps) connectors on the rear panel. In addition, the motherboard supports eight USB 3.1 Type-A (5 Gbps) and eight USB 2.0 ports. The MSI X99A Workstation should be available shortly, but pricing has not yet been decided.  Gallery: MSI Unveils X99A Workstation: Overclocking-Capable Motherboard for Workstations   Source: MSI Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment.

Reply Eden-K121D - Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - link I still prefer Asus x99 deluxe 2 because of the wifi Reply asmian - Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - link Why provide a redesign of X99 that STILL has SATAe, a completely dead and useless connector? If there were a SINGLE available device for it, there would be minimal logic to this, but I'm incredulous that a refresh wastes board space and unnecessary I/O complexity supporting this. Reply evilspoons - Thursday, August 25, 2016 - link The design is probably just a revision of the previous board, and as such it would've been way more work to remove than just leave in. Reply Systab - Friday, August 26, 2016 - link This MB would be amazing if you could OC the current gen of Xeons while keeping ECC. I suspect this is still impossible due to chipset/CPU restrictions. So you either can install a Broadwell-E and get OC but no ECC. Or you can install Xeon E5 v4 get ECC but lose OC capability. Am I right that you can not OC Xeon E5 v4s no matter the MB chipset ?

A 24-core chip accompanies the main system processor to make the holographic display possible. It's both powerful and pricey. HoloLens has two processors. The main CPU is an Intel chip that has been documented since Microsoft launched the first developers edition of the HoloLens back in February. This is accompanied by a separate Holographic Processing Unit (HPU) box that has been shrouded in mystery over the past few months. Yesterday, Microsoft revealed what's inside the HPU. As reported by The Register, it detailed the unique processing box at the Hot Chips conference yesterday. The mysterious HPU contains a custom-built 28nm processor that works with the main Intel chip to power the holographic display, primarily taking responsibility for sensor processing. The processor is built by TSMC and has 24 distinct cores. It is joined by 1GB of low-power DDR3 RAM and is capable of performing a trillion calculations every second. When running HoloLens' complex algorithms, it is over 200 times faster than the Intel CPU alone. Despite the high performance, the entire HPU draws just 10W of power from the wall. The extremely high performance of the HPU is necessary because of the workload it's tasked with. It handles all of the environmental sensor processing for the HoloLens, aggregating data from the sensors on the outside of the wearer. It then considers input controls, such as gestures, and the HoloLens' environmental sensing features. Each of the 24 cores has its own assigned task to work on. Needless to say, this isn't your standard processor. Microsoft has worked directly with TSMC to design the chip for the specific demands of the HoloLens. This is why it acts as a co-processor rather than running the entire device. It isn't capable of supporting the HoloLens' operating system. It's purely a computational machine, crunching through calculations at an otherwise impossible rate. The main processor is a 14nm Intel Atom x86 Cherry Trail chip with its own 1GB of RAM. It's not a high-performance CPU and is akin to the low-power chips found in budget laptops and tablets. It's good enough to run Windows 10 and Universal Windows Apps, however. It hands off to the HPU when it needs to access sensor values. The bespoke nature of the HPU is likely to become an issue when trying to reduce costs of the HoloLens and begin selling it to consumers. Microsoft has extensively modified the TSMC chip it's based on, going so far as to add its own instructions to optimise holographic calculations. The hardware could become more standardised over the next few years, however. As more headsets hit the market, it's likely they'll all start demanding a common set of processing features that chip manufacturers will be able to bake into their products. HoloLens began shipping to developers in March. It is now available to buy without pre-ordering from the HoloLens website, making it easier for developers to get started building holographic apps. Next year, the Windows Holographic platform will be delivered to every Windows 10 PC, allowing you to use these apps on a headset powered by your existing devices. HoloLens is currently the only supported headset, although third-party products such as Intel's Project Alloy are expected to arrive in the next year.

To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Intel released a new IoT developer board at its recent developer conference, according to Engadget. Dubbed “Joule,” it's the most powerful IoT developer kit Intel has ever developed, according to the company. The kit is similar to Arduino and Raspberry Pi in that developers use it to make IoT projects. However, Joule is said to be a lot more powerful than either of those systems. In a press release, Intel noted that the Joule platform will be available in two models and begin shipping this September. Intel says the platform will allow developers to take a concept into a prototype faster and at a lower cost. The Joule is a high performance system-on-module (SOM) running on Linux, which makes it ideal for the industrial IoT in particular. These developer boards are critical for the continued success and expansion of the IoT. A recent IoT developer survey from the Eclipse Foundation found that 84% of developers have used open hardware platforms, like Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Of those that have used the developer boards: 19% say their company deploys IoT solutions using an open hardware platform 33% prototype using the boards 32% have experimented with the boards 9% plan to experiment with them in the next six months Thanks to companies such as Intel, the IoT Revolution is picking up speed. And when it does, it will change how we live, work, travel, entertain, and more. From connected homes and connected cars to smart buildings and transportation, every aspect of our lives will be affected by the increasing ability of consumers, businesses, and governments to connect to and control everything around them. Imagine “smart mirrors” that allow you to digitally try on clothes. Assembly line sensors that can detect even the smallest decrease in efficiency and determine when crucial equipment needs to be repaired or replaced. GPS-guided agricultural equipment that can plant, fertilize, and harvest crops. Fitness trackers that allow users to transmit data to their doctors. It’s not science fiction. This “next Industrial Revolution” is happening as we speak. It’s so big that it could mean new revenue streams for your company and new opportunities for you. The only question is: Are you fully up to speed on the IoT? After months of researching and reporting this exploding trend, John Greenough and Jonathan Camhi of BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, have put together an essential report on the IoT that explains the exciting present and the fascinating future of the Internet of Things.  It covers how the IoT is being implemented today, where the new sources of opportunity will be tomorrow and how 16 separate sectors of the economy will be transformed over the next 20 years.

Source; AMD Photo: Rulison, Larry Reports: Chip made by GlobalFoundries beats Intel 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Malta A next-generation computer chip that GlobalFoundries is making at its Fab 8 factory in Malta for Advanced Micro Devices is generating significant hype in the semiconductor industry for its performance against chip giant Intel. The buzz over AMD's new "Zen" processor, which reportedly performs slightly faster than Intel's top chip, helped lift AMD's stock price last Friday by 10 percent. But it also demonstrates that Fab 8, which employs roughly 3,000 people in Saratoga County, has turned the corner in its quest to become a major commercial force in the chip industry after years of work and billions of dollars of spending on manufacturing development, which has included the licensing of 14 nanometer technology from Samsung. "It is our relentless focus on execution that is now allowing our customers to differentiate their products and to bring them to market on time," Fab 8 general manager Thomas Caulfield wrote in a blog post Friday. "Another great example is the latest news from AMD, who recently gave a performance preview of its next-generation 'Zen' processor core." More Information http://www.amd.com/en-us/innovations/software-technologies/zen-cpu Caulfield was referring to an event that AMD CEO Lisa Su held last Thursday at the St. Regis hotel in San Francisco to demonstrate the performance of the company's new Zen chip against the Broadwell-E, Intel's top central processor. Video of the head-to-head test, along with reports of the event by tech journalists, show that the Zen chip was slightly faster than the Broadwell-E. The event was held just a block away from where Intel was holding its annual developer forum. That's a major coup for AMD, which has struggled to gain market share from Intel, the world's largest chip maker and match its processor speeds. Caulfield says that AMD, which spun off its manufacturing in 2009 to create GlobalFoundries, is benefiting from its close relationship with GlobalFoundries. Under the terms of the spin-off, AMD must buy a significant amount of chips from GlobalFoundries each year, a move that was designed to help GlobalFoundries sustain itself as it grew its customer base. "It is the powerful combination of AMD's design expertise and GlobalFoundries' (14 nanometer) technology that allows Zen to deliver a landmark increase in processor performance over previous generations," Caulfield said. It is rare for companies like GlobalFoundries to disclose which customers it serves at its factories, so there has been a lot of speculation about exactly what chips are being made at Fab 8. Some have speculated that Fab 8 hasn't been able to leap past research and development as it has changed direction and its plans for Fab 8 over the years. However, AMD spokesman Drew Prairie told the Times Union on Monday that both AMD's Zen central processing chips and its Polaris graphics processors are being made at Fab 8. Zen is being released next year, and Polaris is rumored to be going into some of the next MacBook Pro models that Apple releases later this year. "Customer traction remains strong across a number of segments, with more than 20 active engagements in the mobility, consumer electronics, and high-performance computing sectors," Caulfield said. lrulison@timesunion.com • 518-454-5504 • @larryrulison Today's Deals Powered by SHOP NOW Refurb Dell Latitute E7440 Laptops: Extra 50% off Dell Refurbished StorePosted 4 hr 2 min ago SHOP NOW Gap Black Friday Sale: Extra 50% off sitewide + free shipping...

View Latest Posts >>> MI5 blocked arrest of ISIS-supporting radical preacher Choudary for years By Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor on August 22, 2016 …by  Russia Today,  Moscow How many head choppers did Choudary send to ISIS? [ Editor’s Note: My first Press TV Debate show with a major jihdai was with Britain’s Anjem Choudary back on October 21, 2013. I thought I had died and gone to heaven. It was great fun, as was hearing about his recent conviction for supporting the Islamic State. I will shed no tears for his conviction for aiding and abetting IS, but the big story in all this is why was he allowed to funnel large numbers of British jihadis into their ranks so MI-5 could gather Intel… on what at that cost? What Intel could that be for allowing such a large “aiding and abetting” operation to go on, the classic “the cure is worse then the disease”? Cutting off the head of a snake usually produces quick and positive results. His underlings would fill in behind him, providing a new stream of jihadi recruiters to monitor, so it’s not like Choudary’s arrest would have caused lay offs at MI-5. Missing in the equation is the carnage that those Choudary-facilitated ISIS (their name in 2013) recruits inflicted on the Syrian people. Or was it because they were fighting Assad, and that was considered a good use of British Jihadis, including getting some of them killed. But what about the hard core veterans who return to Britain? Where did that future threat weigh in on the equation? One thing you can be sure of, MI-5 will never tell you. One of the major things Top Secret is used for is hiding major screw ups to protect the reputations of those making them and their post government employment opportunities… Jim W. Dean ] ____________ “Bye, bye Anjem, so long and good riddance.”  ~ Jim W. Dean – First published  …  August  21, 2016 – The cops were watching Choudary, but were they using him as a magnet? Counterterrorism officers were repeatedly blocked by British security service MI5 from pursuing criminal investigations against Britain’s highest-profile radical preacher, Anjem Choudary, it has been claimed. Last week, Choudary was found guilty of supporting Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS, ISIL), which seized territory in Iraq and Syria and inspired terrorist attacks across Europe. Following his conviction, it was revealed that the 49-year-old former lawyer had been linked to at least 15 terrorist plots since 2001. Police also believe he has connections to as many as 500 of the 850 young British Muslims who have traveled abroad to join IS. According to the Telegraph, counter-terrorism officers often felt they had enough evidence to build a case against the cleric, only to be told to hang fire by MI5 because he was crucial to one of their ongoing investigations. The situation led to a build-up of tension between the two sides, with police feeling “frustrated” that Choudary was not being brought to justice, a source told the newspaper. He was eventually prosecuted after swearing an oath of allegiance to IS and posting YouTube videos in which he praised the group. One counterterrorism source says the decision not to prosecute him earlier came from MI5. “I am gobsmacked that we allowed him to carry on as long as he did. He was up to his neck in it, but the police can’t do full investigations on people if the security service say they are working on a really big job, because they have the priority,” he told the Telegraph. “That is what they did constantly. While the police might have had lots of evidence, they were pulled back by the security service because he [Choudary] was one of the people they were monitoring. “It was very frustrating and did cause some tension, but we were told we had to consider the bigger picture.” Security expert Will Geddes said while police and security services had a good record of working together, there was often a difficult balance to strike between prosecuting evidence and gathering intelligence. “Whilst the cops always want the collars the spooks want the information and it is a challenge getting the right balance. “Choudary was certainly clever and knew where the line was, and that was part of the reason it took so long to get him. But it was certainly possible that MI5 wanted to continue to monitor him because he was the focal point of so much,” Geddes told the Telegraph. “Given how influential he was in terms of setting up the forums for those guys to get inspired, it made perfect sense for the intelligence agencies to say ‘we haven’t exhausted this yet.’ “In the end though he got caught because he believed his press too much and he got carried away by his own media profile.” Choudary faces up to 10 years in prison when he is sentenced on September 6. ____________   Related Posts: MI5 ‘blocked’ arrest of ISIS-supporting radical preacher Choudary ‘for years’ US now “ISIS’s Air Force” – false flags hit NYC, Jersey Israel major player in Syria destruction: Analyst NEO – Will a Kurdish State be Born Under the Guise of Fighting ISIL?

Helping terrorism. And it has been Britains strategy for a century to strengthen radical backward islam. Primarily to use against the arabs themselves to prevent nationalism, secularism, progressive panarabic movements. But also over all these years Russia has been the intended target.

If I ran Syrian MI, I’d have sent someone to kill him. Really, what is wrong with these Syrians? It can’t just be that Assad is a softie. They knew perfectly well what Choudhary was up to. Blind Freddy knew. The stinking Khazars would have had a kidon on him in an eye-blink. Christ. Log in to Reply wjabbe  August 22, 2016 at 7:51 pm Does not government secrecy, imposed by the full military force and power of government, defeat every basic principle of humane treatment of people and all the basic rights provided to them in our Constitution and Bill of Rights? Do we want a Hillary Clinton or Obama secretly ordering the murder of people in secret, as our representatives? Does not this simply reduce us back to the dark ages of “an eye for an eye” or “the ends justifies the means” days? Have we not risen above all that after all the efforts of the Founders and blood spilled by good American soldiers defending these basic principles all over this planet? I will take the risks for truth over secrecy any day. Secrecy is the antithesis of truth. Secrecy prevents the truth from being known and exposed as in the Sandy Hook Hoax for example.

Dean, Managing Editor  August 22, 2016 at 9:27 pm Often staff changes are the cause. When Emadi had the website added to his news room responsibilities one of the first things he did was kill the Viewpoints commentary section which we had helped build up during the worst of the media sanctions times from nothing over two years with a huge readership. They never gave a reason. He got fired for sexual indiscretions where the lady had taped his phone calls. So things have changed with new people in charge. One of the keys to VT’s success, and our people individually, is that we just out last everybody else, and we keep evolving, which in the Intel biz you have to or you are only valuable as a historian. The hard part is finding young people who are worth the time risk to train, because it our ages we sip it carefully.

Which chipmaker can deliver better long-term growth at current prices? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Aug 22, 2016 at 9:11PM AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have been fierce rivals in the CPU market over the past few decades. Back in 2006, AMD conquered nearly half the PC market with its low-cost chips, according to PassMark Software. But over the past decade, AMD's chips fell far behind Intel's in terms of performance and power efficiency. Last quarter, AMD controlled just 18% of the market while Intel controlled 82%. Image source: Pixabay. AMD's big mistake was waging two separate wars -- one in CPUs against Intel, and another in GPUs against Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Both rivals had deeper pockets, enabling them to launch CPUs and GPUs which eventually outperformed AMD's. AMD stuck to the low-end CPU and GPU markets, merged CPUs and GPUs together in its APU chipsets, and diversified into embedded chips for gaming consoles, ARM-based processors for data centers, and other markets. Intel dominated the PC and data center markets, but it gradually ran out of room to grow. Global demand for PCs started falling, due to longer upgrade cycles and the rise of smartphones and tablets. Intel paid billions in subsidies to convince smartphone makers to use its Atom chips, yet it didn't gain any ground against ARM-based leader Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). Demand for Intel's data center chips also sputtered due to weaker enterprise spending and aggressive competition from rivals like IBM. Intel has diversified into new markets like the Internet of Things (IoT) and non-volatile memory, but these businesses remain small and competition remains fierce. How fast are AMD and Intel growing? The past decade was disastrous for AMD, with its annual revenues dropping from $5.85 billion in 2005 to $3.99 billion in 2015. During that same period, Intel's annual revenue surged 43%. As a result, AMD stock tumbled nearly 70% over the past decade, while Intel stock has more than doubled. However, past performance doesn't guarantee future returns. Last quarter, AMD's revenue rose 9% annually to $1.03 billion, beating estimates by about $75 million and representing its first quarter of year-over-year growth in two full years. AMD expects revenue for the current quarter to rise 18% annually, and analysts believe that it can post 3% sales growth this year and 6% sales growth next year. Most of that growth will be driven by its EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, Semi-Custom) business, which supplies APUs for the PS4 and Xbox One, as well as the GPU for the Wii U. Sony and Microsoft's PS4 Neo, Xbox One S, and Xbox Scorpio hardware upgrades should continue supporting the unit's growth. Image source: Company websites. Intel's revenue rose just 2% annually to $13.5 billion last quarter, missing estimates by $40 million. Weak PC sales caused its Client Computing revenue to fall 3%, and data center revenue rose just 5% -- much lower than the 15% annual growth rate Intel previously targeted. Intel expects sales for the current quarter to rise another 3%, while analysts see its full-year revenue improving 4% for both fiscal 2016 and 2017. How profitable are Intel and AMD? AMD posted a GAAP net profit of $69 million last quarter, which was a massive improvement from its loss of $181 million in the prior year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes gains from a Chinese joint venture, its net loss narrowed from $131 million to $40 million, or $0.05 per share -- exceeding expectations by three cents. Analysts expect AMD's non-GAAP earnings to rise 61% this year and grow at an average annual rate of 49% over the next five years. Intel's GAAP net income fell 51% to $1.3 billion last quarter due to some big acquisition-related charges. On a non-GAAP basis, net income slipped 6% to $2.9 billion, or $0.59 per share, but still beat estimates by six cents. However, much of that beat can be attributed to the $804 million Intel spent on stock buybacks during the quarter and thousands of job cuts. Analysts expect Intel's non-GAAP earnings to improve 7% this year and rise at an average rate of 5% over the next five years. What do the valuations tell us? It's tough to do an "apples-to-apples" comparison between Intel and AMD's valuations, since the former has been consistently profitable while the latter has a negative P/E due to quarters of losses. However, AMD now trades at just 1.6 times sales, which is much lower than Intel's P/S ratio of 2.9 and the semiconductor industry average of 2.9. AMD's better growth numbers and its lower P/S ratio indicate that it's a better buy than Intel at current prices. However, AMD can only keep growing if console sales keep rising, its GPUs can counter Nvidia's aggressively priced Pascal lineup, and the Zen CPUs dent Intel's PC market. If AMD misses those targets, it could quickly give up its gains, so it's still a much more speculative play than Intel -- which remains a decent income-generating stalwart for conservative investors.

Samsung's semiconductor sales rose 11 percent on quarter to $10.3 billion for the second quarter, while Intel's sales fell 1 percent to $12.9 billion for the same quarter, the data compiled by IC Insights showed. In the first quarter, Intel reported $13.1 billion in sales of semiconductors and Samsung posted $9.3 billion, according to the data. Hit by slumping prices of DRAM chips, widely used in personal computers, Samsung's semiconductor sales had been on a decline. However, a rebound came in the second quarter, thanks to strong sales of NAND memory chips for smartphones and other portable devices Samsung has been also narrowing an annual market-share gap with Intel. The market-share gap between Samsung and Intel stood at 5.3 percentage points in 2012, 4.2 percentage points in 2013, 3.4 percentage points in 2014 and 3.2 percentage points in 2015. Meanwhile, SK hynix Inc. was ranked sixth, with its sales of semiconductors at $6.4 billion for the first half of the year, the data showed.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Extreme Microsoft shares details on the secret processor at the heart of HoloLens Microsoft shares details on the secret processor at the heart of HoloLens By Joel Hruska on August 24, 2016 at 3:20 pm Comment We’ve known for a long time that Microsoft’s HoloLens relied on a custom “HPU,” or Holographic Processing Unit, to provide the headset’s mixed-reality mode and augmented reality capabilities. At Hot Chips this week, the company actually released some details on how the chip works and what it’s capable of. According to Microsoft, the HPU can handle a trillion pixel operations per second. While a variety of designs were floated, including a partnership with Movidius, Microsoft ultimately went with a custom design that packs 24 Tensilica DSP cores and 8MB of cache into a single package, alongside 1GB of DDR3. The cores were customized with additional instructions (EETimes reports 300 new instructions, while The Register claims 10). “We used programmable elements wherever possible and fixed function hardware where we needed it to meet our performance goals.” Nick Baker, a technologist at Microsoft, told Hot Chips. “We took co-design to an extreme with this project.” Image by EETimes The chip is designed to process feedback from the HoloLens’ multiple cameras and process it in real time, and shares processing duties with a 14nm Intel Cherry Trail Atom SoC. With Intel having discontinued its Atom tablet and smartphone processors it’s not clear what’s next for HoloLens, and Microsoft hasn’t commented on whether it will develop a second-generation HPU or bring the hardware to market at a lower price point more suitable for the consumer and corporate market. Power consumption for the HPU is also reported differently, with EETimes claiming the chip operates “in a power budget lower than the 4W Intel Atom-based Cherry Trail SoC that acts as its host processor,” while The Register states “The HPU draws less than 10W and includes PCIe and standard serial interfaces.” Image by The Register At present, the HPU operates at less than 50% of its maximum theoretical capacity. While this undoubtedly keeps power consumption down, it also gives Microsoft a way to extend its design and make more use of it in the future without building a brand-new chip. The current HPU is built on 28nm technology at TSMC, which means a die-shrink to 14nm could also improve power consumption and battery life (or allow the chip to leverage more of its processing capabilities in a future product). Microsoft’s slides imply that the data sent to the Cherry Trail SoC is extensively processed to minimize data transfer requirements and power consumption. The company evaluated a number of potential solutions before settling on the DSPs, including sharing a workload across both CPU and GPU and using an array of traditional CPU cores. The available slides suggest that power consumption remains a formidable barrier to making AR work in wearable headsets — future designs will likely focus on minimizing power consumption for both AR and VR. On the other hand, gamers have clamored for higher-resolution displays and larger viewing frustums — and these are the kind of features that tend to increase weight and power draw, not reduce it. Based on what Microsoft has revealed about HoloLens’ HPU, it’s clear that the existing solution has some legs — but without knowing more about Redmond’s long-term plans, we can’t say if we’ll ever see the hardware in consumer price points. Right now, HoloLens is a $3,000 solution and marketed to developers only.

Reports from numerous news sites this week said the company, which competes with the likes of NXP and Infineon and is seeing other chip makers like Intel and Nvidia pushing their way into the autonomous vehicle space, could announce the acquisition soon. The deal would continue a consolidation trend in the semiconductor industry as chip makers buy rivals to build out their capabilities and address such emerging trends as self-driving cars, data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, the internet of things (IoT), mobility and the cloud. High-profile acquisitions in recent years include Intel buying programmable chip maker Altera for $16.7 billion, NXP acquiring Freescale for $12 billion and Avago Technologies grabbing Broadcom for $37 billion in a move to broaden its capabilities in such areas as IoT. In a statement to Reuters, Renesas officials said they were looking at multiple options for growth, including a deal with a chip maker in the United States, but that no decisions had been made. Intersil officials have not commented on the reports. Automotive is a key market for Renesas, and is a fast-growing area for Intersil. In the second quarter, revenue for the business was near record levels, officials said last month. In a July 28 conference call about the quarterly numbers, Intersil CEO Necip Sayiner said that combined, the company's industrial and automotive businesses make up about half of Intersil's revenues. Automotive accounted for about 13 percent of overall revenues. There is a lot of attention being paid to the nascent autonomous vehicle space, and chip makers are expecting to play a key role. Most recently, Intel announced it is working with BMW and Mobileye on a project to bring self-driving cars to market in 2021. Analysts with Strategic Analytics said late last year that fully autonomous cars probably won't emerge before 2025. IHS Automotive analysts are projecting that more than 20 million autonomous vehicles will be on the road by 2035.           del.icio.us | digg.com             Submit a Comment Loading Comments...     Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter China is one of the world’s largest consumers of semiconductor devices thanks to its manufacturing might, and is planning to spend more than $100 billion to become also a premier supplier to the planet. The global consultancy estimates that by 2020, almost 55 percent of the world’s memory, logic and analog chips will flow to or through the country. But the vast majority of the microchips that act as the brains of products like Apple Inc.’s iPhone are largely imported from companies like Intel Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co. The government in 2014 moved to change this with plans to invest more than $100 billion and become a leading global player. It’s also driven consolidation among domestic suppliers to maximize its investments, including the $2.8 billion merger of Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. and Wuhan Xinxin Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. announced last month. China’s effort to build a world-leading semiconductor industry is part of a broader effort to wean itself off foreign technology. But financial investment will not be enough to buy leadership of the semiconductor sector, which is worth around $1 trillion according to Singapore-based Bain partner Kevin Meehan. The country currently makes just 15 percent of the semiconductors it consumes, Bain said in a report. And by 2020, the consultancy expects Chinese-based plants to produce just 7 percent of the world’s microchips, barely up from current levels. “China is coming at it in a pretty smart and intelligent way,” he said. “But I don’t see a path for them to own leading-edge processor technology and that is the foundation of Intel, the foundation of Samsung’s success.” To read a Gadfly column on China’s evolving chip industry, click here. Efforts by Chinese companies to buy rivals with intellectual property in the processor and memory markets have run afoul of regulators around the world. Plans for a $3.8 billion investment in Western Digital Corp. were scrapped amid a U.S. security review and investments in Taiwanese chip companies face regulatory obstacles and have stoked political tension. “Assuming they can spend it all, the biggest risk is that they end up with a whole bunch of fragmented and weak follower positions,” Meehan said. “There’s ways for them to have influence over greater than 10 percent if they’re partnering well, but otherwise I think you’re essentially capped there.” Meehan said China’s semiconductor makers could eventually learn from partnerships with global giants and become one of the larger suppliers of key components like computer memory. Both Intel and Qualcomm Inc. have agreed to build semiconductor fabrication plants there in partnership with local providers. “If you take a long view -- not five years but decades -- then certainly you’d have to believe there’s some absorption,” he said. "But people are careful not to put their leading edge IP in China.” “I don’t see a way to get there without licensing or buying.” (A previous version of the story corrected the amount that China supplies the world) Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The spectrum is in the 3.5 GHz band (specifically 3550-3700 MHz) and is being referred to as the Citizens Radio Broadband Service, so the joint effort is called the CBRS Alliance. The founding members consist of: Google, Intel, Nokia, Qualcomm, Ruckus Wireless and Federated Wireless. This partnership was first publicly discussed back at MWC this year but it seems to have taken them half a year to get their act together. The availability of the 3.5 GHz band has been spoken about for a while, but the rules governing the coexistence of incumbent users with new entrants were only formalised earlier this year. The presence of a significant chunk of unlicensed spectrum so close to licensed bands has intrigued many companies, recently causing Google to reassess is fibre plans. “There is ever-growing demand for LTE-based solutions in 3.5 GHz bands and expansion of the wireless footprint,” said Neville Meijers, VP of small cells for Qualcomm and chairman of the board for the CBRS Alliance. “Working together, the CBRS Alliance aims to enable the entire industry to address demand by expanding the capacity of new technologies.” “Working together, the Alliance will ultimately build LTE-based solutions for the CBRS band – creating one of the many paths that will make it possible to help meet challenges associated with the coming data capacity crunch, which experts predict will reach over 30 exabytes per month by 2020,” blogged Intel’s Shawn Covell who moved there from Qualcomm. “Federated Wireless has been instrumental in leading the creation of the shared spectrum ecosystem that will enable carriers and enterprises to seamlessly and cost effectively alleviate the challenges of sharing and managing spectrum while improving the performance and capacity of wireless networks for their customers,” said Iyad Tarazi, CEO of Federated Wireless. “The CBRS Alliance can be a critical driver to the success of the shared spectrum deployment in the CBRS band, which we believe has great potential to drive innovation, support new business models and spur economic growth.” This move brings together two prevailing trends in the wireless industry right now: the exploitation of unlicensed spectrum and the formation of partnerships. It speaks volumes about the potential of this resource that so many industry heavyweights are staking a claim but you do have to wonder why the likes of AT&T and Verizon aren’t part of the gang.

Wildfire is carried in spam messages and demands up to 1.5 Bitcoins of ransom for files to be decrypted. Security researchers have uploaded 1,600 decryption keys with more to come to the No More Ransom joint ransomware-busting effort between McAfee and parent company Intel, Kasperksy Labs, Europol's EC3 cybercrime division, and dutch police. The group earned US$79,481 (£60,240, A$104,399) over the last month by infecting 5,309 systems, Intel Security chief technology officer Raj Samani and advanced threat researcher Christiaan Beek found. "The victims were misled with a notice of a missed delivery and instructions for scheduling a new delivery by filling in a special form attached with the mail," the pair say. "This form was in fact an obfuscated dropper that infects the victims with the ransomware. "The actors behind Wildfire have clearly put a lot of effort into making their spam mails look credible and very specific." Countries including Russia; Moldova; Estonia; Latvia; Lithuania, and Belarus are excluded from being targeted by the ransomware in a tactic typically designed to avoid drawing local law enforcement heat. Samani and Beek say the actors are likely a Dutch-speaking group due to language and iconography used in the Wildfire spam, but did not suggest the attribution was certain. It also appeared Wildfire was operated under a service model in which criminals can rent ransomware and the necessary infrastructure to launch attacks against users, typically with some commissions in the range of 20 to 30 per cent going to malware writers. Facilitators link new buyers to ransomware writers, and other necessary service offerings such as traffic pushers and encrypting services. Criminals can net a conservative US$84,000 a month in the ransomware game for an investment of $6000, a whopping 1,425 per cent profit margin, Trustwave found last year. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 4 Comments More from The Register Billion-tonne IceCube: Sterile neutrino does not exist We're, um, Straight Outta 'fourth' 'trons...

Think of it as truckers-versus-tech 24 Aug 2016 at 02:58, Richard Chirgwin Richard Chirgwin Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics NBN, Security , Science, Broadband, Google Recent Articles Chap turns busted laptop into phone keyboard, in Himalayan book-rescue mission Thanks, IoT vendors: your slack attitude will get regulators moving Microsoft drops tools to help ingest and model big datasets Another industry alliance is gearing up to pitch mobile phone spectrum access to spectrum in the 3.5 GHz band – this time using frequencies formerly devoted to Citizens Band (CB) radio users. Following a decision by America's Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to free up 150 MHz of the “truckers' Internet” for unlicensed use, industry giants have created a new group to push LTE into the band. The CBRS Alliance has its eye on frequencies between 3550 MHz and 3700 MHz in America. The group so far comprises six companies: Alphabet's Access Technologies, Federated Wireless, Intel, Nokia, Qualcomm, and Brocade-owned Ruckus Wireless. Google has already conducted some field trials in the band, and the CBRS Alliance plans more field trials through 2016. Intel's boilerplate boast explains the ongoing desperate hunt for spectrum by pointing out that “a single smart hospital might use up to three terabytes of data per day”. The group, which first announced its intentions in February, will work on standards definition, technology adoption, and coexistence management. Coexistence has already proven a sore point as vendors and carriers try to scoop up whatever spectrum they can find. Since last year, LTE-U's alliance has been working on a coexistence plan that would let it borrow Wi-Fi spectrum, in the face of strong opposition from Wi-Fi users. Its coexistence plan is due in September, but along the way, LTE-U advocate Qualcomm has complained that its suggestions for coexistence and field tests have been ignored. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 27 Comments Whitepapers Build scalable and secure public cloud services Based on the industry-leading products and technologies your customers demand, Red Hat provides a complete set of platforms, tools, and software components you need to build a scalable, agile, and secure cloud services infrastructure.

Wildfire is carried in spam messages and demands up to 1.5 Bitcoins of ransom for files to be decrypted. Security researchers have uploaded 1,600 decryption keys with more to come to the No More Ransom joint ransomware-busting effort between McAfee and parent company Intel, Kasperksy Labs, Europol's EC3 cybercrime division, and dutch police. The group earned US$79,481 (£60,240, A$104,399) over the last month by infecting 5,309 systems, Intel Security chief technology officer Raj Samani and advanced threat researcher Christiaan Beek found. "The victims were misled with a notice of a missed delivery and instructions for scheduling a new delivery by filling in a special form attached with the mail," the pair say. "This form was in fact an obfuscated dropper that infects the victims with the ransomware. "The actors behind Wildfire have clearly put a lot of effort into making their spam mails look credible and very specific." Countries including Russia; Moldova; Estonia; Latvia; Lithuania, and Belarus are excluded from being targeted by the ransomware in a tactic typically designed to avoid drawing local law enforcement heat. Samani and Beek say the actors are likely a Dutch-speaking group due to language and iconography used in the Wildfire spam, but did not suggest the attribution was certain. It also appeared Wildfire was operated under a service model in which criminals can rent ransomware and the necessary infrastructure to launch attacks against users, typically with some commissions in the range of 20 to 30 per cent going to malware writers. Facilitators link new buyers to ransomware writers, and other necessary service offerings such as traffic pushers and encrypting services. Criminals can net a conservative US$84,000 a month in the ransomware game for an investment of $6000, a whopping 1,425 per cent profit margin, Trustwave found last year. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 4 Comments More from The Register Billion-tonne IceCube: Sterile neutrino does not exist We're, um, Straight Outta 'fourth' 'trons...

IBM Revives Its Fight With Intel Over Server Chip Dominance Fortune 8/23/2016 Barb Darrow © Provided by Fortune POWER9 DD1 die photo - print 4x4 300dpi Intel remains at the top of the heap of server chip makers, but that doesn’t mean rival IBM has given up. Popular Searches Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 778.51 -6.82 -0.87% Eli Lilly and Co LLY ▼ 68.35 -7.64 -10.05% Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 111.12 -0.69 -0.61% Urban Outfitters Inc URBN ▼ 33.91 -5.11 -13.09% Quite the contrary, IBM this week renewed its push to make its Power9 chip a top contender. It revealed specifications for the new “P9” chips Tuesday at the HotChips technology conference in Cupertino, Calif. Starting next year, P9- based systems will be available from IBM and associated hardware partners, according to an IBM spokesman. The chips will go into servers starting for as little as $6,000, but the purported beauty of these new chips is that they will act as expandable hubs into which server makers can plug graphics chips as well as special-purpose Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and other performance enhancers as needed. That means manufacturers can fine-tune the boxes they make for specific purposes to, in theory, wring the best performance out of the hardware. So, if you want to sell a server that runs a small number of real-time algorithms very fast, you can do so. The Power9 chip will come in two basic designs, one for crunching numbers for big data or artificial intelligence applications like IBM’s favorite product Watson. The second will target Google-like “hyperscale” applications that must run across hundreds or thousands machines. This is an interesting story for IBM. Given Intel’s dominance, IBM’s chip architecture was pretty much used by IBM alone until three years ago, when the company decided to make its Power software and hardware technology available to outsiders via the OpenPower Foundation. Initial partners in the foundation included Mellanox mlnx which makes switches and host adapters; NVIDIA, which makes graphics processors; and Tyan, which produces motherboards. Those are all key server components, but the biggest brand coming aboard was Google goog, which said it was interested in using POWER chips in its own servers. That was definitely a coup for IBM because Google uses hundreds of thousands or millions of servers to power its Internet search, cloud computing, and other businesses. Since that time Google, which can be secretive about what technology it uses internally, has reportedly run earlier Power8 chips in its servers. And Google data center guru Urs H?lzle told technology trade publication The Next Platform that the company would run Power9 if it could realize a 20% power savings. Words like that have got to get Intel’s attention. Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. IBM isn’t the only server chip taking on Intel. AMD has been pushing its own “Zen” server processor technology that is starting to take off, as AMD chief executive Lisa Su told Fortune a few weeks ago.

Two Free Decrypters Available for WildFire Ransomware GO Intel McAfee & Kaspersky both provide free decryption tools Aug 23, 2016 21:55 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Intel McAfee and Kaspersky have published two decrypters that can unlock files encrypted during WildFire ransomware infections. Both tools are available for download via the NoMoreRansom website, a collaboration between the two companies, the Dutch police, and the Europol European Cybercrime Centre (EC3). WildFire appeared in the spring and targeted only the Netherlands WildFire is a ransomware that was first spotted in mid-April, under the name GNL and then Zyklon. The ransomware rebranded at the end of May, taking the current WildFire name, which it still uses. During June, and later July, WildFire devs started a series of massive spam floods to distribute their ransomware, mostly targeting users living in the Netherlands. Security researcher MalwareHunterTeam told Softpedia that Wildfire ransomware campaigns continued in the month of August, even if not reported by security vendors as the initial wave of spam. Based on data Softpedia received from MalwareHunterTeam, and from a later OpenDNS analysis, we presumed that Russian developers are behind this new ransomware variant. Dutch police confiscate WildFire C&C servers At the time it was discovered, security researchers said the ransomware wasn't decryptable because it featured a solid encryption scheme. Researchers investigating this threat caught a lucky break when the crooks behind WildFire decided to register custom Dutch domains and host servers in the Netherlands. "By working together with the police on this case, we had something much better in our hands: The botnetpanel code!" said Kaspersky's Jornt van der Wiel. After police confiscated the crooks' servers and gained access to the ransomware's decryption keys, researchers created two free WildFire decrypters. Further, because they had access to the C&C server statistics, security researchers concluded that during the last 31 days, WildFire infected 5,309 computers, with 236 users paying the ransom.

Mobileye and Delphi Automotive announced a partnership to develop fully automated vehicle systems by 2019. The two companies aren’t talking about what many describe as “driver-assisted technology.” Mobileye and Delphi specified that they are planning to have SAE Level 4 and 5 automated driving solutions ready for automakers to install in their vehicles. Related: Updated – Is BMW teaming up with Intel, Mobileye to develop autonomous vehicles? Level 4 autonomy means that even though a human driver is in the vehicle, for most driving modes the on-board system handles all driving, monitoring, and fallback safety tasks, even when the human is not capable. Level 5 doesn’t need a human in the vehicle at all for any driving modes. Related: Delphi hopes to make self-driving taxis a reality in Singapore by 2022 The two companies are going to produce the “Central Sensing Localization and Planning” (CLSP) platform which will be the hardware, software, and system components, in other words, the whole deal for a complete automated driving solution. The CLSP platform will draw from each company’s unique technologies. For Mobileye, known for its computer vision systems, mapping, localization, and machine learning focus, this means its EyeQ 4/5 System on a Chip (SoC) with sensor signal processing for real time mapping and vehicle localization. Delphi’s automated driving software, sensors, and systems integration will bring automated driving algorithms with path and motion-planning, and integrated sensor controllers for a full suite of camera, radar, and Lidar. The joint effort will also develop sensor fusion technology and driving behavior modeling with deep learning so the vehicles will know, learn, and be able to drive safely with other vehicles and with pedestrians in complex urban routes. This is not the first autonomous driving venture for either company. Mobileye systems are part of Tesla’s current Autopilot version, although they will not be used in future versions. Mobileye is also working with BMW, Intel, and other automotive and tech companies. Delphi, in addition to developing 48V mild hybrid systems, is also working on creating a fleet of self-driving taxis in Singapore. The two companies have a history of working together on vehicle safety systems dating back to 2002. Neither Delphi nor Mobileye are in the car manufacturing business — their goal is to develop fully operational autonomous vehicle systems automakers can incorporate. Their new partnership intends to draw from the expertise of each and significantly speed up adoption. Mobileye’s Chairman and Chief Technology Officer Professor Amnon Shashua said, “Our partnership with Delphi will accelerate the time to market and enable customers to adopt Level 4/5 automation without the need for huge capital investments, thereby creating a formidable advantage for them.” Delphi’s President and Chief Executive Officer Kevin Clark added, “This partnership will allow us to give our customers an increased level of automated capabilities faster and more cost effectively. The collective expertise of our two organizations will accelerate the creation of new approaches and capabilities that would likely not have been possible working alone. This is a win-win for both companies and our customers.” The newly formed partnership plans to have a demo ready for both highway and urban driving by next January, to be shown at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, and production-ready systems by 2019.

Minyanville Top Trade Ideas for the Week August 22, 2016: Bonus Idea By Scutify Aug 22, 2016 1:57 pm PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten: Intel, $INTC, was a market leader during the dotcom collapse in 2000. It had a price of over $75 in July 2000 before losing over 80% of its value over the next 28 months. Since that time it has retraced 38.2% of the move down and stalled. The chart below shows that one jump to the 38.2% level but also that the 35.25 price level has been a big road block for 2 years. The last year of that price action has shown consolidation against 35.25 and tightening support, rising in an ascending wedge. A break of the wedge pattern gives a price target to 45.25. The move higher since the end of June establishes a secondary target on a Measured Move to 38.50 along the way. Momentum indicators support more upward price action. The RSI is bullish and rising and the MACD is rising too. And the Bollinger Bands® are open to the upside for a move. Above resistance at 35.25 there is some at 37.90 and then you have to go back to November 1999 to find it at 39.50 and 42. There is very little price history above that but some resistance possible at 45.30 and 61.50. This stock is about to get out of a big log jam. Support lower comes at 34.40 and 33.75 before 32.70. Short interest is low at 1.4% and the company is expected to report earnings next October 18th. Options chains show large open interest this week at the 35 and 35.50 strikes on the call side and at the 34.5 strike on the put side. At September Expiry the 35 call strike has far and away more open interest than any other strike on both sides, with the 35 put strike next. That might hold it in this range for another month or draw it back if it moves in the short run. The October expiry, the first after the next earnings report, shows the biggest open interest at the 35 call strike as well. But there is very large open interest at the 36 and 37 call strikes too. Looking to January 2017 sees the 35 strike largest too but also volume at the 37 and 40 strikes. Intel, Ticker: $INTC Trade Idea 1: Buy the stock on a move over 35.25 with a stop at 33. Trade Idea 2: Buy the stock on a move over 35.25 and add an October 35/32 Put Spread while selling a January 2017 38 Call, 12 cents for the collar. Trade Idea 3: Buy the January 35 Call ($1.97). Trade Idea 4: Buy the January 35/October 37 Call Diagonal ($1.50). Trade Idea 5: Buy the January 35/October 37 Call Diagonal and sell the October 33 Put ($1.05).

After reviewing over 1,000 charts, I have found some good setups for the week. These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which with August Options Expiration in the rear view mirror, sees the equity markets are looking settled and stable, digesting their moves higher. Elsewhere look for Gold to consolidate with an upward bias in its uptrend while Crude Oil continues to pump higher. The US Dollar Index looks to continue lower in its broad consolidation while US Treasuries are biased lower in their short term consolidation. The Shanghai Composite looks to continue higher but Emerging Markets look ready to consolidate or pullback short term in their uptrend. Volatility looks to remain at abnormally low levels keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF's SPY, IWM and QQQ. Their charts suggest more sideways motion in the short term with the possible exception of the IWM which is drifting higher. Longer term, the topping candles suggest a pause or pullback may be in order soon. Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad'em well.

By Keith Townsend | August 23, 2016, 8:25 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/shironosov Linux is a general purpose operating system. This comment may sound like an obvious statement, but it's sometimes easy to forget. Because it's a general operating system, it is used across a variety of use cases. The OS is used in Internet of Things (IoT) devices, smartphones, tablets, servers, and data center appliances. However, it sometimes takes a reminder that using Linux for specialized use cases, such as a network or even network function devices, takes some customization of the kernel or the acceptance that performance may be uneven or limited. The Intel-sponsored open source Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) project hopes to extend the usefulness of Linux to include high-performance networking devices. Linux high-performance networking It's a challenge to achieve high-performance networking inside of the Linux kernel. A dangerous oversimplification would be to say that Linux networking is optimized for general purpose computing. According to this deep dive from CloudFlare, a common conception is that Linux maxes out at 50K packets per second (pps). Pps calculation is a bit different than bits per second (bps). While an interface on a server may have a speed of 10Gbps, it doesn't necessarily correlate to how much data gets processed. See: Intel launches silicon photonics (ZDNet) More about Networking Gartner's 10 big trends that will change how IT operates How to deploy a Samba domain controller in under 10 minutes Real-world server room nightmares Subscribe to TechRepublic's Data Center Trends newsletter In the CloudFlare write-up, the experiment used the minimum Ethernet Frame size of 72 bytes or 576 bits. The author was able to achieve a peak throughput of 1.4Mpps, or about 8Gbps on a 10Gbps link. The challenge is primarily that of processor efficiency. The test worked hard to pin threads to specific processor cores to eliminate wasted cycles. According to the article, a realistic goal using the described process is achieving throughput of 1Mpps sustained. 1Mpps doesn't come close to consuming a 10Gbps link. So, why do we see multiple 10Gbps links, or even 40Gbps links in x86 servers? Bypassing the kernel To utilize processors more efficiently in Linux, developers bypass the Linux kernel and dedicate CPU cores to network processing. The CloudFlare example used Linux kernel tools to pin processes to a set of cores and actively managed memory queues. It took a bit of programming discipline to send unprocessed packets between two systems. Add any packet processing, such as IPS, and the performance should drop significantly. DPDK bypasses the Linux kernel and manages the NIC and CPU assignment directly. On a single Intel processor, it's possible to achieve throughput of up to 80Mpps or roughly 46Gbps using the smallest Ethernet Frames. I want to make sure I caveat the above comment and note that it was an Intel processor. DPDK is an open source project and currently has both Intel and ARM distributions. Enterprise use cases The DPDK is a development kit. The audience is creators of network software and devices. However, these devices make their way to the enterprise. An intriguing use case is hypervisors and network functions virtualization (NFV). It's easy to envision an NFV-based firewall or IPS that leverages DPDK to achieve single instance processing of up to 10Mpps without using specialized hardware. DPDK is yet another enabler for software driving the replacement of dedicated hardware in the data center. X86 and ARM servers continue to supplant dedicated hardware for both traditional storage and network use cases. For a deeper dive on DPDK, I suggest this presentation from a Tech Field Day event.

At a press conference after their meeting, Cazeneuve called for social media operators running encrypted services to cooperate with security services and the police into criminal investigations.  "If such legislation was adopted, this would allow us to impose obligations at the European level on non-cooperative operators," he told a joint conference with his German counterpart in Paris. There is still a huge debate within the EU over mass surveillance — an issue that came to the fore following the revelations by former CIA contractor Edward Snowden of mass surveillance by the US National Security Agency (NSA) and Britain's GCHQ.  Although human rights groups have pushed for only selective, targeted collection of communications data, some countries — such as the UK — are introducing legislation allowing for security services to collect bulk communications data — including telephone records, social media usage and web browsing history — in the fight against terrorism.

The only way forward is together @BCazeneuve @BMI_Bund @Place_Beauvau https://t.co/bXSmYM9kHt — DimitrisAvramopoulos (@Avramopoulos) August 23, 2016​ However, many people — including terrorists — are switching to encrypted services for messaging each other, or even the dark web. Ahead of their meeting, Cazeneuve and de Maiziere said they would be looking at options to limit the use of encryption in the fight against terrorism. The position is particularly sensitive for France and Germany, as both have been targeted by terrorists or lone wolf attackers, making the subject of security a sensitive matter, ahead of national elections in both countries next year. #Encryption under heavy fire as Franco-German Ministerial duo presents new demands for EU's security https://t.co/6hPE9LdKuB — Access Now (@accessnow) August 23, 2016 Terror Attacks France was rocked in January 2015 by the Charlie Hebdo shootings in Paris, the related hostage-taking in a kosher supermarket at Porte de Vincennes in east Paris and the November 13 attacks in which 130 were killed and hundreds injured in a series of shootings and suicide bombs. © East News/ AP Photo/Keystone, Laurent Gillieron Baker Pascal Clement arranges loafs of bread with "Je suis Charlie" In July 2016, the driver of a 20-ton truck ploughed into crowds along the promenade in Nice killing 84 and injuring scores more.

This was intended to be a preview of tomorrow's Hot Chips presentation, and we've already covered the juicier parts of the presentation in terms of microarchitecture announcements as well as diving deep into the Server-based Naples implementation and what the motherboards told us from memory and IO support.  You can read both here: AMD Zen Microarchitecture: Dual Schedulers, Micro-op Cache and Memory Hierarchy Revealed AMD Server CPUs and Motherboard Analysis There was one other element to the presentation that requires further discussion and analysis, if only to clean up some of the misinformation already present online and to label what was shown with a long list of potential caveats which most people seem to have passed by almost entirely. As part of the show, AMD compared the performance of their Zen engineering sample to an Intel Broadwell-E processor.  In this test, they told the audience that each system was running eight cores, sixteen threads, and will all cores set to 3 GHz (implying no turbo). Memory arrangements were not disclosed, nor storage: we were told to assume comparable setups.  We were too busy trying to decipher what was on screen (and take note of the results) to actually photograph the benchmark as it happened (there are videos online), but the benchmark they showed was Blender, an open source rendering engine, with a custom multithreaded workload. The test was to render a mockup of a Zen based desktop CPU, with an effective workload of 50 seconds for these chips. I've seen numerous reports about this result saying the difference was 1 or 2 seconds, but with rarely a mention of the benchmark length, which is as important. The overall results were   Blender Time to Render / sec Intel Broadwell-E Core i7-6900K 8C / 16T 3 GHz all-core 49.05 AMD ZEN Engineering Sample 8C / 16T 3 GHz all-core 48.07 (-0.98 sec, 1.998%) All things being equal (we'll get to that in a second), this would suggest that an 8-core AMD has a ~2% advantage over Broadwell-E at the same clock speeds. Despite this result, there are a lot of unverifiable parts to the claim which makes analysis of such a result difficult. I want to go through each of them one by one to ensure everyone understands what was presented.  I'll preface this analysis with two things though: one is that AMD was very careful in what they said at the event, and only said as much as they needed to. Thus is why the string of caveats for this benchmark test is fairly long. But also, AMD has to set expectations here: if they choose an environment and test that represents the peak, or relies on something special, users will feel burned again after Bulldozer. AMD has to temper those expectations but still represent a methodology that is effective to them. By leaving so many cards on the table, this can both be a help or a hindrance. But given the measured and calm, professional nature of the event, as opposed to the wild and wacky AMD events of the past, it was clear (either by design or chance) that the words used said only as much as they needed to. Along with the microarchitecture discussions, it was designed to provide a good stepping stone on to the Hot Chips presentation a few days later. So, caveats. Or disclaimers not readily provided. Let's start at the top.  1) The Results Are Not Externally Verifiable At This Time, As Expected We were told the setups of the systems being used, but were unable to confirm the results manually. This is typically the case with a high level, early look at performance and other companies do this all the time. This being said, it would look bad on reports if it to turns out or someone finds a chasm between pre-launch and launch data, so the aspect of reporting this data without understanding this caveat is fundamental. The basis of publishing scientific papers is repeatability and verification - while this wasn't a scientific presentation, it is important to keep it in the back of your mind when you hear any benchmark numbers (AnandTech included - our numbers are designed to be verifiable and we want to have a history of honesty with our readers, especially when it comes to custom software/workloads we cannot disclose).  2) No Memory or TDP Numbers Were Provided We were able to determine that the AMD-based systems were running 2x8 GB of DDR4-2400, although we did not get a look at Intel's memory arrangement. Similarly, due to the ES nature of the CPU, TDP numbers were also not shared however we did see all the AMD systems use either the AMD Wraith cooler (which is rated at 125W) or the new near silent cooler (95W). That tends to peg the system at a peak power consumption and some of AMD's current competitive parts actually use a cooler designed for the bracket above in TDP (e.g. A10-7860K at 65W uses the 95W cooler, A10-7890K at 95W uses the 125W cooler).  3) Blender Is an Open Source Platform One of the issues of using open source is that the code is editable by everyone and anyone. Any user can adjust the code to optimize for their system and run a test to get a result. That being the case, it can be difficult to accurately determine the code base for this test, and is relatively impossible to determine the code base of Blender that was compiled for this test. Even in the base code, there could be CPU vendor specific optimizations in either the code or compiler that influences how the code manipulates the cache hierarchy with the workload and adjusts appropriately. It also doesn't help that Blender has elements in the code called 'AMD', which relates to a series of internal rendering features not related to the company. Going down the optimization for specific CPU microarchitectures leads on to another more philosophical issue... 4) Did It Actually Measure IPC? (The Philosophical Debate)  In the purest sense, measuring the number of instructions per clock that a set of instructions can perform can determine the efficiency of a design. However, the majority of highly optimized code bases do not have general-purpose code - if it detects a particular microarchitecture it can manipulate threads and loops to take advantage of the code design. How should IPC be measured is the main question: using identical code bases makes it easier to understand but are often non-real-world compiler targets, or highly optimized code to show the best of what the processor can do (which means that IPC performance is limited to that benchmark)? With the results we saw, if the difference of about a second in just under fifty seconds translates into a 2% difference, is it accurate to say that this is a 2% IPC increase, or does it rely on optimized/non-optimized code? Optimizing code, or profiling compilers for specific code targets, is nothing new. In the holistic view, most analysts use SPEC benchmarks for this, as they are well-known code structures, even though most benchmarks are compiler targets - while SPEC is not particularly relevant for the real world workloads, it does give an indication about performance for unknown architectures/microarchitectures. 5) The Workload Is Custom  One of the benefits of software like SPEC, or canned benchmarks like Cinebench, is that anyone (with a license) can pick up the workload and run with it. Those workloads are typically well known, and we can get performance numbers out that have known qualities in their interpretation. With a custom workload, that is not always the case. It comes down to experience - an unknown workload can have a lop-sided implementation of certain branches of code which is unknown when it comes to running the results. This is why rendering one scene in a film can take a vastly different time to another, yet the results for the 'benchmark' are significantly different depending on the architecture (one prefers lighting, another prefers tessellation etc.) Using known or standard workloads over long periods of time can offer insights into the results, whereas new workloads cannot, especially with so few results on offer. 6) It Is Only One Benchmark There is a reason for AMD only showing this benchmark - it's either a best case scenario, or they are pitching their expectations exactly where they want people to think. By using a custom workload on open source software, the result is very specific and cannot be extrapolated in any meaningful way. This is why a typical benchmark suite offers 10-20 tests with different workloads, and even enterprise standard workloads like SPEC come with over a dozen tests in play, to cater for single thread or multi-thread or large cache or memory or pixel pushing bottleneck that may occur. Single benchmarks on their own are very limited in scope as a result. 7) There's Plenty about the Microarchitecture and Chip We Don't Know Yet, e.g. Uncore One of the more difficult elements on a processor is managing cross-core communication, as well as cross-core-cache snooping. This problem is overtly exponential, with the plausibility of more direct connections per core as the numbers go up. Intel has historically used a torus (ring) interconnect between cores to do this, with their large multi-core chips using a dual ring bus with communication points between the two. We suspect AMD is also using a ring bus in a similar methodology, but this has not been discussed at this time. There's also the interconnect fabric between the cores and other parts of the chip, such as the Northbridge/Southbridge or the memory controllers. Depending on the test, the core-to-core communication and the interconnect can have different performance effects on the CPU.  8) Clock Speeds Are Not Final, Efficiency Not Known Performance of a CPU is typically limited by the power draw - there is no point getting a small amount of performance for a large increase in power such that efficiency has decreased. AMD has stated that power consumption and efficiency was a premier goal as this microarchitecture was developed. At the demonstration, we were told that the frequency of the engineering samples was set at 3 GHz for all-core operation. We were told explicitly that these are not the final clock speeds, but it at the very least it puts the lower bound on the highest end processor. In reality, 3 GHz could be a walk in the park for the final retail units, depending on how much difference there is between the chips on display and what people will be able to buy. We are under the impression that the CPUs will have turbo modes involved, and those could be staggered based on the cores being used. But this is why I said that 3 GHz is the lower bound of the high-end processor. We know from these results (assuming point 1 in this list) that the best processor from AMD will do at least 3 GHz. There's no indication of power, and thus there's no indication of efficiency either, which is also another important metric left in the ether. 9) We Will Have to Wait to Test Everyone wants the next technology yesterday, so the 'gimme gimme gimme' feeling of new stuff is always there. AMD has already stated that general availability for Zen and Summit Ridge will be Q1, which puts the launch at four months away at a minimum. At this stage of the game, while AMD is trying to be competitive with Intel, they don't want to generate too much hype and give the game away in case it goes incredibly pear-shaped. There's the added element of the hardware and software being finalized or updated. Since I've been reviewing, no CPU manufacturer has handed out review units four months before launch (in all honesty, we're lucky to get a launch date sample a week in advance these days). In fact we'd have to go back to Nehalem and Conroe to find something that was sampled early; however Conroe just passed its 10th birthday and in that case, Intel knew they were on to a clear winner ahead rather than just 'meeting expectations'. Also, early samples of a great product will mean users will wait for it to come out, which results in revenue loss (the Osborne effect) unless you have zero stock and/or an uncompetitive product that no-one is buying. In this decade, no x86 CPU manufacturer has offered samples this far out. I'd be more than happy for that to change and I would encourage companies to do so, but I understand the reasons why.  Some Final Words Much in the same way that taking an IQ test tells you how good you are at an IQ test, it is typically an indication that you are good/bad at other things as well (most well-engineered IQ tests go through a lot of spatial reasoning, for example). In this circumstance, a CPU performing a Blender test is only as good as a Blender test, but given what we know about the Zen microarchitecture, it is probably also good at other things. Just how good, in what metric and to what extent, is almost impossible to say. AMD has given a glimpse of performance, and they’ve only said as much as they needed to in order to get the message across. However it has been up to the media to understand the reasons why and explain what those caveats are. Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment.

The chip handles a trillion pixel-operations/second in a power budget lower than the 4W Intel Atom-based Cherry Trail SoC that acts as its host processor. The HoloLens processing unit (HPU) fuses input from five cameras, a depth sensor and motion sensor, compacting and sending it to the Intel SoC. It also recognizes gestures and maps environments including multiple rooms. Microsoft described the guts of HoloLens earlier this year, but has not until now publicly detailed its HPU. The company evaluated merchant computer-vision chips including those from Movidius but found none that handled all its algorithms at its performance, latency and power targets. The TSMC 28nm chip packs 24 Tensilica DSP cores and 8 Mbytes cache into a 12x12mm package with 65 million transistors. A GByte of LPDDR3 is included in the HPU’s package. Click here to read more ...

The Cluster is housed at the state-of-the-art Supernap Switch facility in Las Vegas. "The opening up of the CNCF cluster is the single most positive thing in the world of cloud native that I have seen this year," said Fintan Ryan, industry analyst at RedMonk. "We are already seeing the CNCF taking a lead in bringing communities and companies together to work in an open collaborative manner. Ultimately this collaboration will benefit everyone using cloud native technology." Access to the $15 million CNCF Community Cluster, a 1,000 node server deployment of Xeon processor-based Intel servers, allows developers to initiate large-scale integration testing before releases, as well as assess the feasibility and scalability of experimental approaches. To be used by open source projects, this infrastructure can be leveraged to run multiple scalability and performance tests and deploy various software stacks easily and at scale. "If you are developing cloud native open source software and want to ensure that it functions at scale, please apply to run it on the CNCF Community Cluster," said Dan Kohn, executive director of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Multiple projects are using or in the process of applying for use, including CNCF-hosted projects Kubernetes and Prometheus, the Apache Zookeeper project and others. "Deploying applications in a cloud is different than in traditional data centers, from performance levels and monitoring to security and system management, to orchestration and deployment, and resiliency of the physical infrastructure," said Jason Mendenhall, executive vice president of Cloud at Switch. "The CNCF Community Cluster will help open source developers resolve issues on the entire cloud native stack." The application for cluster usage lists the requirements, including: That the code being run is 100% open source, That the testing advance cloud native computing (specifically containerization, orchestration, microservices or some combination), and That the testing involve containerized workloads, if appropriate. "The cluster is designed to provide developers with the opportunity to test applications at larger scales than they could on their own. Ultimately, this will make the move to cloud infrastructure faster and easier for businesses of all sizes, allowing enterprises to benefit from the efficiency and agility of a cloud native architecture," said Jonathan Donaldson, vice president, Data Center Group and general manager, Software Defined Infrastructure at Intel Corporation. About the cluster: The CNCF Community Cluster, operated by Intel for the CNCF community, provides users a staged path to first develop and test on a small scale and then graduate to large-scale testing. It includes the hardware needed to develop, debug and run cloud native software on relevant infrastructure at scale. Users of the cluster will be able to experience the rare value that the cluster represents: size and bare metal. The compute node and storage specs include: Compute Node Spec 2x Intel E5-2680v3 12-core 256GB RAM 2x Intel S3610 400GB SSD 1x Intel P3700 800GB NVMe PCIe SSD 1x QP Intel X710 Storage Node Spec 2x Intel E5-2680v3 12-core 128GB RAM 2x Intel S3610 400GB SSD 10x Intel 2TB NLSAS HDD 1x QP Intel X710 To submit a request to use the CNCF Community cluster, file an issue here.

Facebook Twitter Google RSS Cloud Mobile Social Big Data Bleeding Edge Columns Get McAfee’d Dr. Bitcoin smartworld Future Data City of Paradigm Masthead Send Us a News Tip Select Page ARM sets its sights on supercomputers with new chip design by Mike Wheatley | Aug 22, 2016 | 0 comments Fresh from having conquered the mobile market, U.K.-based microchip designer ARM Holdings Ltd. is now setting its sights on powering the world’s fastest computers. It’s just unveiled a new chip design for supercomputers, an extremely lucrative market where until now, it’s had zero presence. The new design, which is based on ARM’s mobile chips, has some substantial tweaks to provide a significant boost in computing power. ARM’s announcement comes just weeks after the company agreed to be sold to Japanese telecoms giant SoftBank Group Corp. in a massive $32 billion deal. ARM is likely to use some of that cash to further its ambitions in the data center and Internet of Things (IoT) spaces. The company’s latest design, which was unveiled at the Hot Chips conference in Cupertino, California, yesterday, also sends a signal to rivals like Intel, IBM and others that it’s just as capable of developing blazing-fast supercomputing chips as they are. Japan’s Fujitsu Ltd. will build the first supercomputer packing the new chips, called the “Post-K supercomputer,” ARM said. Fujitsu recently said it would be dropping its own SPARC architecture in favor of ARM’s designs, and helped with the design of the new chip. Japan, along with the U.S. and China, is racing to be the first nation to build a supercomputer that delivers 1 exaflop of performance, or one million, trillion calculations per second. Companies including Intel, IBM and NVIDIA Corp. also aspire to the same goal with their own chip designs. The Post-K supercomputer will be the successor to Fujitsu’s K Computer, which is ranked as the fifth fastest computer in the world at present. Post-K will be between 50 and 100 times faster than the latter, which delivers 10.5 petaflops of peak performance using Fujitsu’s SPARC 64 VIIIfx chips. ARM’s new design is based on the company’s 64-bit ARM-v8A architecture, and one of its interesting features is it relies on vector processor extensions to deliver a performance boost, much like the earliest supercomputer chips in the late 1980s and early 1990s did. Vector processors later went out of fashion as supercomputer designers looked to IBM’s more affordable RISC chips in the mid-1990s, before later switching to standard x86 processors. But just like any good fashion trend, history is repeating itself and vector processing is in vogue once again, with new designs like ARM’s and Intel’s Xeon Phi chips both sporting them. RELATED:  Wikibon sees ARM, OpenPower, flash storage prospering in 2017 ARM believes its new chip design will provide both a performance boost and also consume less power – an important consideration given the phenomenal rate at which supercomputing speeds are growing. ARM isn’t the only upstart looking to disrupt the supercomputing space. China’s Sunway TaihuLight, currently the world’s fastest supercomputer, boasts its own homegrown ShenWei processor, which offers a peak performance of 125.4 petaflops. Perhaps more importantly for ARM, the new design will help give it a leg up in the data center chip market, an arena where its so far struggled to make any inroads against the all-powerful Intel. ARM-based servers have been on the market for some time, but adoption remains low. However, with large server clusters quickly becoming the norm for emerging technologies like machine learning, these could clearly benefit from the low-precision calculations that a large congregation of ARM’s chips could provide.

(NYSE:T) and chipset manufacturer Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) announced its collaboration to develop new software-centric network technologies. This will aid AT&T in optimizing its Network for Functions Virtualization (NFV) capabilities for its AT&T Integrated Cloud (AIC) service. Focus on Ethernet Market As per Vertical System Group Ethernet rankings, AT&T tops the leaderboard in the U.S Ethernet market. Notably, its continuous investment and improvement in this space has enabled the telecom giant to emerge as a pioneer as well as gain a strong foothold in the Ethernet market. Moreover, this collaboration with Intel will allow AT&T to provide new software-based network services and capabilities to its customers faster. The company is planning to run open source software on its hardware resources powered by Intel’s chip to enable virtualized network functions going ahead. Network Virtualization – A New Trend At present, cloud based functions are provided by Ethernet providers such as AT&T through a series of expensive dedicated hardware. Through new software-based network services and capabilities, any service provider can run its network functions on a less expensive hardware. This will allow the Ethernet service providers to provide cloud based functions to their clients at much lesser cost thereby increasing margins in the process. AT&T is targeting in getting 30 percent of its network virtualized by the end of 2016, with a goal of reaching 75 percent by 2020. The Bottom Line AT&T is investing heavily to improve its cloud services and consolidate its position in the Ethernet market. However, the company is likely to face challenges from significant players such as Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR –Analyst Report) which has benefitted a lot from the fiber footprint it gained after its recent merger with Time Warner Cable. Moreover, CenturyLink Inc. (CTL – Analyst Report) too has been escalating its cloud capabilities of late. AT&T INC Price AT&T shares were mostly flat in premarket trading Tuesday at $40.86. T has gained nearly 19% since the start of 2016, more than doubling the S&P 500’s 7% rise in the same period. This article is brought to you courtesy of Zacks Research.

Although it was already revealed that the headset uses an Intel Atom Cherry Trail for its main processor, that isn’t actually the one doing the heavy lifting. Instead, it is the 28 nm “holographic processing unit” or HPU fabricated by TSMC that does most of the sensor processing required to deliver a fluid, real-time AR experience. That HPU is quite remarkable in many ways. It utilizes 24, yes 24, Tensilica DSP cores, or Digital Signal Processing, for taking all the data thrown at it by sensors and processing them. All of that happens on hardware so that it’s super fast, as much as a trillion calculations per second. The HPU custom designed for that kind of processing so that it is actually faster doing it on this kind of processor than passing it on to the Intel x86 CPU. The HPU has 8 MB of SRAM and its own 1 GB of LPDDR3 RAM, separate from than it the Atom CPU’s own 1 GB RAM. The chip draws less than 10 w of power, which is remarkable power sipping considering all the processing that it does. By the time the data reaches the Intel CPU, it has mostly been processed already so that the CPU has less to do. It’s almost like how motion sensor data processing on some smartphones, like the iPhone, are offloaded to a dedicated low-power chip to keep the more power-hungry CPU running as seldom as possible. Microsoft has added custom instructions to the HPU, making it a very customized component. As such, it is far from something that can be easily commoditized. We are, however, still at the earliest days of augmented, really mixed, reality, and hopefully, in the future, such hardware will be more common in order to make AR headsets like the HoloLens also more common.

Sadly for AMD their investment in the “Bulldozer” architecture was misplaced for where the industry was heading.  While we certainly see far more software support for multi-threaded CPUs, IPC is still extremely important for most workloads.  The original Bulldozer was somewhat rushed to market and was not fully optimized, while the “Piledriver” based Vishera products fixed many of these issues we have not seen the non-APU products updated to the latest Steamroller and Excavator architectures.  The non-APU desktop market has been served for the past four years with 32nm PD-SOI based parts that utilize a rebranded chipset base that has not changed since 2010. Four years ago AMD decided to change course entirely with their desktop and server CPUs.  Instead of evolving the “Bulldozer” style architecture featuring CMT (Core Multi-Threading) they were going to do a clean sheet design that focused on efficiency, IPC, and scalability.  While Bulldozer certainly could scale the thread count fairly effectively, the overall performance targets and clockspeeds needed to compete with Intel were just not feasible considering the challenges of process technology.  AMD brought back Jim Keller to lead this effort, an industry veteran with a huge amount of experience across multiple architectures.  Zen was born.   Hot Chips 28 This year’s Hot Chips is the first deep dive that we have received about the features of the Zen architecture.  Mike Clark is taking us through all of the changes and advances that we can expect with the upcoming Zen products. Zen is a clean sheet design that borrows very little from previous architectures.  This is not to say that concepts that worked well in previous architectures were not revisited and optimized, but the overall floorplan has changed dramatically from what we have seen in the past.  AMD did not stand still with their Bulldozer products, and the latest Excavator core does improve upon the power consumption and performance of the original.  This evolution was simply not enough considering market pressures and Intel’s steady improvement of their core architecture year upon year.  Zen was designed to significantly improve IPC and AMD claims that this product has a whopping 40% increase in IPC (instructions per clock) from the latest Excavator core. AMD also has focused on scaling the Zen architecture from low power envelopes up to server level TDPs.  The company looks to have pushed down the top end power envelope of Zen from the 125+ watts of Bulldozer/Vishera into the more acceptable 95 to 100 watt range.  This also has allowed them to scale Zen down to the 15 to 25 watt TDP levels without sacrificing performance or overall efficiency.  Most architectures have sweet spots where they tend to perform best.  Vishera for example could scale nicely from 95 to 220 watts, but the design did not translate well into sub-65 watt envelopes.  Excavator based “Carrizo” products on the other hand could scale from 15 watts to 65 watts without real problems, but became terribly inefficient above 65 watts with increased clockspeeds.  Zen looks to address these differences by being able to scale from sub-25 watt TDPs up to 95 or 100.  In theory this should allow AMD to simplify their product stack by offering a common architecture across multiple platforms.

Qualcomm, Padres aim to make Petco smart Qualcomm, Padres aim to make Petco smart Mike FreemanContact Reporter Shortly before the MLB All Star Game last month at Petco Park, the San Diego Padres received an email alert that a couple of key air conditioners in the stadium weren’t working properly. The email came from recently installed sensors, software and communications technology from Qualcomm and OSIsoft, which provides real-time, detailed data about energy, water and gas use at the ballpark. On Wednesday, the Padres and tech companies involved held a press conference to talk about the technology and how it can reduce power and water use. "Our goal is to take this same architecture and help any large scale venue — a campus, a mall, any place where you have a lot of people coming together under one roof — and help them achieve their sustainability goals," said Kiva Allgood, head of Qualcomm’s smart cities programs. A technician installs smart gateway technology in Petco Park to help the San Diego Padres reduce water and power use.

A technician installs smart gateway technology in Petco Park to help the San Diego Padres reduce water and power use. There are several companies betting big on the growth of the Internet of Things industry, with Qualcomm, Intel and others aiming to stand out. Smart cities, where sensors help public workers departments and building managers cut energy and water use, is expected to grow fast in the next decade. Petco is the third demonstration project for Qualcomm’s smart cities technology, which links together sensors to provide immediate and detailed data about power and water use. Qualcomm did a similar project with OSIsoft at the smartphone chip makers San Diego campus. It also used the technology to monitor infrastructure at San Diego International Airport. The company claims its gateway technology can "connect the unconnected" without the hefty costs of installing new systems. According to Qualcomm, ballparks are difficult for facilities to manage. They go from empty to full of fans in just a few hours. Many were not built with sophisticated instrumentation and control systems to monitor water or power. At Petco, Qualcomm supplies so-called edge intelligence gateways — boxes that collect the sensor data using wireless and wire line technologies. The gateways then ship sensor readings to OSIsoft’s data center, where its software platform interprets what’s going on for the Padres in real time. The technology gives Petco managers a very detailed, real-time view of where water and power are being used, said Jake Flohr of OSIsoft, which is based in the Bay Area. Instead of getting monthly reports on overall water use, the system lets stadium officials drill down to know how much water is being used on field irrigation, in bathrooms or at concessions during any given game or event, he said. "It gives them a good idea specific to each area of the stadium and allows them to take a more pinpoint approach to reducing their footprint," said Flohr. There are roughly 230 large stadiums in the U.S. Many are in regions that are experimenting with smart cities technologies to reduce energy and water use. The Padres’ goal is to reduce operational expenses by more than 25 percent in the next five years at Petco, said Randy McWilliams, senior director of facility services for the Padres. "By using the gateways together with the open data infrastructure, we can see exactly how much water, power and gas each operation uses ballpark-wide, and can work with our operators and tenants to manage usage and increase the reliability and overall performance of the venue," he said. mike.freeman@sduniontribune.com Twitter @TechDiego Copyright © 2016, The San Diego Union-Tribune US Politics Latest Most Popular Jobs Homes Cars Customer Help Today's Paper 67°

A survey conducted among 7,600 university students of the UAE by international employment research company Universum, revealed that Google continues to win the hearts of business studies students. The search engine company seems to be the top choice, giving employees a perfect work/life balance, job security, and the chance to be entrepreneurial and creative in their career. Google also provides an incredible reference for anyone's future careers. For engineering students: 1. Google 2. Apple 3. Microsoft 4. Emaar 5. Masdar 6. Adnoc Group 7. Dubai Airports 8. Etihad Airways 9. Intel 10. Dewa As part of Universum's Middle East Talent Survey 2016, done over a six-month period, the research uncovered university students' attitudes about employers and what drives their career choices. Students of all nationalities and study streams said their top career motivators are high earnings and professional training. Emiratis expected an average monthly salary of Dh17,395 per month in their first job, while non-Emirati respondents expected Dh11,888 per month. "Graduates all around the world are clear about the fact that if they have Google on their resume, they can land any job they want going forward. Globally, students know about its fantastic work environment to the incredible perks and benefits, while also being able to work on exciting new technologies. This combination makes for an irresistible choice among graduates today," said Claudia Tattanelli, chairman of the Strategic Advisory Board at Universum. Emirati students eye ?clean energy Emirati engineering students, however, put Masdar in the top spot as the ideal employer. For commerce students: 1. Google 2. Apple 3. Emaar 4. Dubai Airports 5. Etihad Airways 6. Microsoft 7. Emirates Group 8. L'Oreal Group 9. Adnoc Group 10. Ernst & Young (EY) Ahmed Baghoum, executive director for Human Capital and Services at Masdar, said: "We are honoured to be trusted by Emirati youth - for the second year in a row. Our mission to advance the clean energy industry in Abu Dhabi and around the world resonates well with their future ambitions." Another field gaining popularity among locals is aviation. Etihad has been named one of the best places to start a career. Ray Gammell, Etihad Aviation Group Chief for People and Performance, said: "To be voted by students as the top employer in the airline industry within the UAE is a wonderful recognition that reflects Etihad Airways' commitment to attracting and developing Emirati talent to build the nation's future aviation leaders. It's also no surprise that Dubai Airports is placed in the top 10 ideal companies ranking for both Emiratis and expats students across all disciplines. As for personal career goals, students of all nationalities and study areas prioritised work/life balance, job security, and the chance to be entrepreneurial and creative in their career. Friendly work environs and respect for employees are also key drivers, along with a prestige-name employer who provide the best training and development. saman@khaleejtimes.com Share More > Vote MORE FROM Nation Travel Short trips you can take from Dubai this Eid Al...

News & Analysis Power9 Opens IBM to Partners One chip, four variants and tons of eDRAM Rick Merritt 8/24/2016 02:49 PM EDT 3 comments NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet CUPERTINO, Calif. — IBM’s Power 9 processor, described for the first time at Hot Chips yesterday, could become a break out chip, seeding new OEM and accelerator partners and rejuvenating Big Blue’s bid against archrival Intel in high-end servers. The 14nm Power 9, first mentioned in March, takes a bold if somewhat fragmented strategy in the hot area of accelerators. It is IBM’s first Power chip to emerge as a family to enable a range of scale up and scale out system designs. Like past IBM microprocessors, to reach new performance levels it uses a gob of memory—including a whopping 120 Mbyte embedded DRAM in shared L3 cache riding a 7 Tbit/second on-chip fabric. Across a range of benchmarks, Power 9 should deliver from 50% to more than twice the performance of the Power 8 when the new chip arrives late next year, said Brian Thompto, a lead architect for the chip. New core and chip-level designs contribute to the performance boost. Versions of Power9 using DDR4 DIMMs could attract OEMs competing on costs. (Images: IBM) Click here for larger image IBM will release four versions of Power 9 (shown above). Two will use eight threads per core and 12 cores per chip geared for IBM’s Power virtualization environment; two will use four threads per core and 24 cores/chip targeting Linux. Both will come in two versions — one for two socket servers and 8 DDR4 ports and another for multiple chips per server with buffered DIMMs. The diversity of choices could help attract OEMs. IBM has been trying to encourage others to build Power systems through its OpenPower group that now sports more than 200 members. So far, it’s gaining most interest from China where one partner is making its own Power chips. Use of standard DDR4 DIMMs on some parts will lower barriers for OEMs by enabling commodity packaging and thus lower costs. Power9's 120 MByte L3 is parsed out in 10 MByte blocks shared by two cores.

Power9 power consumption is not a sellable point. ( I heard IBM couldn't bring down num of watts ) 2. Benchmarking analysis is not mentioned w.r.t its competitors. 3. Over all only performance boost is highlighted. ( Not sure what is the trade-off here ) Plus point : Finally, IBM realized to open up to catch up the market.

In a letter sent by the Hawks to Gordhan on Monday, Major-General MS Ledwaba states that Gordhan’s alleged actions “amount to” unauthorised expenditure and/or fruitless and wasteful expenditure in terms of the Public Finance Management Act and corruption in terms of the Prevention of Corrupt Activities Act. Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan (Matthew Le Cordeur, Fin24) This is the first time it has been revealed that the law enforcement agencies are investigating Gordhan for corruption. In his letter, Ledwaba writes that Gordhan (as finance minister) had “approved that then deputy commission of Sars, Ivan Pillay, could take early retirement at 56 with full retirement benefits” from 1 August 2010 and that his employer should pay his early retirement penalty to the amount of R1 258 359 “despite the early retirement being for personal considerations of the employee when ordinarily the employee must pay the early retirement penalty in terms of the law”. Intel unit Ledwaba says Gordhan also approved the reappointment of Pillay as deputy commissioner on a contract basis for a further three years. The Hawks are further investigating Gordhan for the creation of an intelligence unit inside Sars. In a letter by Gordhan’s lawyer Tebogo Malatji to the Hawks, the finance minister slams the Hawks’ claims as “unfounded”. “The offence of corruption (under the Act) in the first place requires that the perpetrator ‘gives or agrees or offers to give to any other person any gratification’. The minister did not give or agree to give gratification to anybody. He merely gave official approval to the proposal of the commissioner that Sars allow Mr Pillay to take early retirement and be re-appointed.” No legal obligation to go to the Hawks - Gordhan Malatji’s letter continues: “The giving of gratification in any event does not amount to corruption in itself. It is corrupt only if the gratification is given to the recipient ‘in order to act, personally or by influencing another person so to act’, in an unlawful manner. “There has never been any suggestion that the minister approved the commissioner’s proposal that Mr Pillay be allowed to take early retirement and be re-appointed to persuade him to act unlawfully in any way.” Gordhan believed “in good faith that the transaction was entirely lawful. It means that he in any event lacked any mens rea” (the intention or knowledge of wrongdoing that constitutes part of a crime). Ledwaba asked Gordhan to appear before a Brigadier Xaba of the Hawks at 14:00 on Thursday. Gordhan has since refused to appear before the Hawks, saying he was under no legal obligation to present himself to the police.

Take the story of Anatoly Klyosov, connecting Russia to the western world for the first time in 1982, as an example. A bio-chemist who was not allowed to leave the soviet territory for security reasons. The internet enabled him to participate in meetings with his counterparts at Harvard University, University of Stockholm and beyond. With the evolution of the internet, the purpose of connecting to the internet has also evolved. People, now, can not only hold conversations but also get both public and private sector services at home such as healthcare, education, statistics, legal, financial, telecommunication and others. People are able to do business from home with the help of e-commerce and provide services beyond the traditional national boundaries. The discussion here is how to enable people to connect to the internet and take advantage of all the benefits that the internet provides to them. What factors play crucial role in setting up the environment for connecting the unconnected individuals whether living in urban part of the world or rural. Surprisingly 57% of the world's population are urban unconnected. 68% of the population in Asia Pacific has no broadband connection. At a regional IGF event in Taipei, Taiwan, the Asia Pacific regional Internet Governance Forum, where more than 500 Internet Governance practitioners and experts participated. I was given the task to present our group's understanding and analysis of the theme "Cyber Connectivity" where four sessions were held. We had sessions on Disaster and Disabilities in terms of Crisis & Management, Overcoming challenges in APAC outreach and participation in the new Internet era, Promoting alternative access models at the last mile & Fostering MSME (Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises) participation in the digital economy. A number of use cases and examples of internet connectivity that has taken place in the region over the past decade were shared. Mahabir Pun from Nepal presented his efforts in connecting the remote rural villages of Himalaya, Vu Huang Lien shared his experiences of connecting the rural parts of Vietnam, Google representative shared their plans on connecting more people in India and Intel shared their experiences which they called "connecting people to their potential" where they spent US$ 1 billion globally on providing hands-on training and entrepreneurship skills. All diverse sessions had somewhat common barriers or challenges for connectivity. While some of the challenges were not of relevance to participants from urban parts of Japan or Taiwan but the rural parts of the same countries and many other developing and least developed countries still face most of the challenges that I will highlight briefly. While each of these challenges or needs could be and should be elaborated in-depth to verify them and study them further, I will be as concise as possible to highlight their hindrance in connecting or enabling the next ~4 billion to connect. * * * 1. Government realization and support for broadband connectivity: One of the fundamental challenges to internet growth is the governments' realization and support to the provisioning of internet access. This support could be in form of national policies and legislatures which will enable the market for either foreign investments or domestic economy. Google's representative Paul Harwood also emphasized on government support to local innovation, he said "Innovation in high speed Internet access should be a top public policy priority. Policy makers need to make sure that their countries are Internet ready". 2. Basic Infrastructure: In countries with rugged mountains especially with Himalayas that passes through Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan and China, or small Islands scattered all over the Pacific such as Vanuatu, Cook Island, Samoa, Fiji, Hawaii, Tonga etc. running fiber optic is challenging and very costly, which makes internet access almost "unaffordable" for end-users. Landlocked countries of Central Asia or Africa, in particular, face the challenge of fiber optic not available beyond the urban parts of the countries. The cost of IP transit takes a toll on the infrastructure development. 3. Basic Literacy: Literacy and internet have direct correlation, the increase in literacy rate allows in the increase of internet usage. A person's ability to read, write and speak in a language that computer applications usually support, is crucial in using the internet. 4. Localization: Some say local content will increase with large number of people getting online, however in the absence of technical possibility for people to write in their own language makes it hard for local content to grow organically. Large Operating System (OS) vendors play crucial role in the enablement of people to read and write in their local languages. There are still a large number of languages that are not supported by the leading desktop or mobile OSs. Language support in operating systems and applications is one hurdle to creating local content and language standardization is another. National localization policies should provide the standardization recommendations to Vendors to accommodate more languages. 5. Local Content: The lack of relevant local content, either locally produced content in a non-local language or local language content produced for that locality, is crucial for allowing citizens to use the internet for their development and livelihoods. The inability of writing text in an application because of OS not supporting the language or unavailability of broadband internet for users to upload large sized videos further deteriorates the content problem. 6. Digital Skills: Aside from basic literacy which allows a person to navigate the internet, digital skills were deemed necessary for making good use of the vast offerings of the internet. Digital skillset are required for using technology at home, at work and for entrepreneurial initiatives. The benefits and services of the evolving internet requires a continuous effort for awareness and education. 7. The need for speed: High speed internet service or broadband internet is required for citizens/consumers to participate, contribute and help evolve the development of the internet. 8. Affordable prices: Studies show that the next 3-4 Billion unconnected people are from the poorest socio-economic group and this would require new business models in order to allow them to connect. Two areas where government and private sector need to focus are; affordable prices for broadband and mobile data, and affordable prices for devices. 9. E-payment: Electronic payment system is considered to be a barrier to e-commerce. Without an e-payment infrastructure and electronic transaction laws, local innovation and entrepreneurship in e-commerce could be a major challenge. 10. Cyber-security: Cyber-security incidents were considered a major threat to enabling people to come online or adopt new(er) technologies. Three recommendations were highlighted. Awareness about how end-users can protect themselves against cyber-security incidents. Reactive measures (CIRT establishment and collaboration at regional, sub-regional and global level for information exchange). Proactive measures for mitigation of cyber incidents. 11. Social and organizational cultures: Change could be identified as one of the big barriers for individuals and organizations to adopt new technologies. Technology applications are built-in with biases that limit people from adopting and using it. At the organization level, there has been internal digital divide within an organization or among the organizations. Take the example of e-government; one government entity will be better equipped to deliver public services through internet while others will be finding it difficult to communicate via email within their organizations. 12. Legal framework: The legal framework is one of the environment factors that facilitates the digital developments. Privacy and data protection laws, cyber-security laws, electronic payment & transaction laws etc. enable individuals' online protection as well as allows digital economy development through foreign or local investment. Large corporations don't make entries into economies that don't provide them legal protection. 13. Regulatory framework: A strong regulatory framework mitigates the negative implications of the internet on business as well as on society in general, by addressing the challenges faced by women and children online for example. Strong and positive regulation provides positive image of the use of the internet especially in cultures that associate negative aspects of the internet such as hacking, financial and social crimes, with the use of the internet. It's also important to consider that regulators at the national levels need the necessary skillset to design, develop and formalize regulatory policies. One of the fundamental difference between local initiatives and foreign or corporate investments for connectivity was that corporate initiatives were focused on wiring more people. Whereas local initiatives had organic approach and their home-grown efforts were addressing the needs of the local communities. Their approaches were providing a package of connectivity and application. Providing the understanding of the variety of benefits that a home user or an entrepreneur can get from connecting to the internet paves the next few steps for them. This enablement of the user should be fundamental to the connection. By Said Zazai. More blog posts from Said Zazai can also be read here.

The car will initially be used for commercial ride-hailing or ride-sharing services; sales to consumers will come later. “This is a transformational moment in our industry and it is a transformational moment for our company,” said CEO Mark Fields, as he announced the plan at Ford’s Silicon Valley campus in Palo Alto, California. Ford’s approach to the autonomous car breaks from many other companies, like Mercedes-Benz and Tesla Motors, which plan to gradually add self-driving capability to traditional cars. Just last month, BMW AG, Intel Corp. and the automotive camera maker Mobileye announced a plan to put an autonomous vehicle with a steering wheel on the road by 2021. Instead, Ford is taking the same approach as Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which supports moving directly to self-driving cars once the technology is perfected. “We abandoned the stepping-stone approach of driver-assist technologies and decided we were going to take the full leap,” said Raj Nair, Ford’s chief technical officer. Nair says Ford will continue developing systems that assist the driver, like automatic emergency braking or lane departure warning. But he said semi-autonomous systems that can operate the car but then cede control back to the driver when an obstacle is encountered are actually dangerous in Ford’s view. Engineers couldn’t figure out how to make sure drivers stay engaged and ready to take over. So, Ford decided to remove the driver altogether. “We learned that to achieve full autonomy, we have to take a completely different path,” Nair said. Jeremy Carlson, a senior analyst with IHS Automotive, says he doesn’t know of another automaker who’s taking Ford’s approach. But there are challenges either way, he said. Riders may have a hard time trusting fully autonomous cars, for example, but semi-autonomous cars can be dangerous because drivers may not understand what the vehicles can and cannot do. “I don’t think there’s going to be any one right answer,” he said. Ford’s vehicle will be specifically designed for commercial mobility services, like taxi companies, and will be available in high volumes. Ford says personal ownership of self-driving cars will come later. Ford didn’t say whether it would work with a ride-sharing partner or try to establish services on its own. Rival General Motors Co. has a partnership with the ride-hailing company Lyft and has also bought a self-driving software company called Cruise Automation. Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford also said it plans to double the staff at its Palo Alto research centre by the end of next year to nearly 300 people. It will buy two more buildings next to its current building in order to expand its campus, Fields said. Ford will also make several investments and partnerships to speed its development of autonomous vehicles. Ford and Chinese search engine company Baidu will each invest $75 million in Velodyne, a company that makes laser sensors that help guide self-driving cars. Velodyne, based in Morgan Hill, California, says it will use the $150 million investment to expand design and production and reduce the cost of its sensors. Laser sensors—dubbed Lidar, which stands for light, detection and ranging—can also be used in conventional vehicles as part of driver assist systems. Ford said it has acquired Israel-based computer vision and machine learning company SAIPS for its expertise in artificial intelligence and computer vision. It also invested in Berkeley, California-based Civil Maps for its three-dimensional mapping capabilities. Ford has also formed a partnership with New York-based Nirenberg Neuroscience LLC, a machine vision company that has developed devices for restoring sight to patients with degenerative eye diseases.   News from © Canadian Press Enterprises Inc. 2016 Share This Post Tweet Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Print this page Related Posts Ford CEO looks to autonomous cars, sharing economy Ford teams up on autonomous driving Exec: Most Lyft rides in autonomous cars in five years Nissan keeps self driving simple and not quite autonomous Cash rebates may boost electric car sales: officials Impact Auto Auctions launches new website Salary Calculator Calculate More REDWIRE Services Subscribe to Print E-newsletter Advertise Contact Us View Digital Edition Browse Print Archives View Digital Edition Browse Print Archives View Digital Edition Browse Print Archives Manufacturing Network Sitemap Copyright Notice Privacy Policy © Copyright 2016 Annex Business Media × Close REDWIRE Powered by FRASERS REDWIRE is News you can use from Leading Suppliers.

Its classy-looking case hides top-tier components, including a nippy SSD and overclockable Intel processor. For Overclockable processor Primed for VR and 1440p gaming Nippy SSD storage Attractive design Against Can get a stronger GPU for less Not cut out for 4K gaming Nvidia hasn't so much shaken up mobile gaming with its desktop-grade Pascal notebook GPUs as turned it completely on its head. The company's GTX 10-series graphics card have also made a mark in the desktop space, providing an opportunity for system builders to come up with powerful, single-GPU configurations capable of running the best VR games and demanding 4K setups. Called the Titan Hadron, the latest machine from Stoke, UK-based system builders Overclockers UK promises oodles of gaming grunt, courtesy of Nvidia's GTX 1060 GPU. But, as we now know, there's no such thing as a cheap Pascal card. Even at the mid-range, Nvidia's card pushes up the Hadron's price to £1,091/US$1,4453/AUS$1,894, with an offer currently shaving £30/$US40/AUS$52 from the price. However, it's important to note that the cost includes a number of enviable features. Among them are an SSD along with a capacious HDD, an overclockable, top-tier Intel processor and, of course, one of the beefiest graphics cards around. Micro machine One of the more interesting aspects of the Titan Hadron is its design. Overclockers has gone for Fractal Design's Node 804 Micro-ATX case, which separates warmer running components from cooler ones while allowing for unrestricted airflow to the Asus Z170M motherboard and sixth-generation Intel Core i5-6600K processor inside. We're a fan of the case's unassuming appearance. Black materials dominate without appearing bland, in part thanks to a brushed aluminum finish on the front panel that contrasts with a plastic mesh along the bottom. Viewed head-on, it looks like a high-end subwoofer that's part of an expensive speaker set-up. Rotate the Titan Hadron on its side, and the mask slips, revealing a view that's more typical to PC gamers. A transparent side panel provides a view of the various components inside, which are bathed in a green light that emanates from the top of the case's roof. Spec sheet Here is the Overclockers UK Titan Hadron configuration sent to TechRadar for review: CPU: 3.5GHz Intel Core i5-6600K (Quad core, 6M Cache, up to 3.9GHz using Turbo Boost) Graphics: Gainward GeForce GTX 1060 Dual (6GB GDDR5) RAM: 8GB DDR4 (2,400MHz) Storage: 240GB SSD; 1TB HDD (7,200 rpm) Ports: 1 x USB 3.1 (Type-C), 3 x HDMI, 2 X DisplayPort, 2 x DVI-D, 3 x USB 3.0, 2 x USB 2.0, 1 x VGA, headphone/microphone ports, Ethernet Size: 12.09 x 13.54 x 15.31 inches (H x W x D) Weight: 13.22 pounds (6kg) Don't be fooled by its name – the Titan Hadron isn't powered by Nvidia's wallet-intimidating Titan X; nor does it fire tiny particles around super quickly, for that matter. It actually opts for a more sensible choice of card in Gainward's GeForce GTX 1060, which sports 6GB of GDDR5 memory. Compared with Nvidia's newer GTX 1060 that has half the video memory at 3GB, the version on offer here is much more suited to 1440p gaming, much less 1080p. The Intel's 6600K Skylake processor is more than capable of matching the Nvidia part, the 'K' denoting that it can be overclocked to provide horsepower for gaming. It's more than up to the task out of the box, but overclocking is a welcome option to have for enthusiast users who can get their hands dirty in MSI Afterburner or another tool of choice. You won't get caught short for ports, as there's an abundance of I/O around the back. That includes a USB 3.1 Type-C port for speedily transferring data to an external hard disk or hooking up a compatible peripheral. There are two more USB 2.0 ports on the right hand side of the case, located alongside headphone and microphone ports, the power button and slot loading CD drive. These can be fiddly to access if the machine is facing a direction that hides them out of view, forcing you to run your hand along the edge to find them. Relocating them to the top of the case wouldn't have been a bad move. Benchmarks Here's how the Overclockers UK Titan Hadron performed in our suite of benchmark tests: 3DMark: Cloud Gate: 19,409 ; Sky Diver: 23,179 ; Fire Strike: 10,072 Cinebench CPU: 599 points; Graphics: 126 fps GeekBench: 3,980 (single-core); 11,498 (multi-core) PCMark 8 (Home Test): 4,568 points GTA V (1080p, Ultra): 43 fps; (1080p, Low): 163 fps; (4K, Ultra): 14 fps The Division: (1080p, Ultra): 60 fps; (1080p, Low): 150 fps Steam VR Bench: Ready Nvidia says that the GTX 1060 is good for GTX 980-grade frame rates, and our benchmarks show that to be true. The Titan Hadron scored 10,072 in PCMark 8's Fire Strike benchmark, compared to the 9,284 achieved by the 980-powered Asus GX700. Overclockers' machine also scored higher in Cinebench R15's graphics test (126.3 fps versus the GX700's 101.26 fps), and more than double in our demanding GTA V 1080p Ultra settings benchmark (43.3 fps versus 21 fps). With the exception of extremely demanding games, like GTA V, the GTX 1060 is capable of maxing out games at 1080p; it's also a solid performer at 1440p. We played Doom at that resolution on Ultra settings and got a consistent 55 - 70 fps, depending on which environment we were in. As expected, it struggled at 4K, straining to reach around 30 - 45 fps at 4K on Ultra and frequently dipping to as low as 25 fps. It almost goes without saying that the GTX 1060 isn't as powerful as the GTX 1070, losing out in every GPU benchmark compared to the StormForce Tornado that we recently reviewed. At £899/US$1,180/AUS$1,540 the Tornado also costs less despite having the more powerful GPU. On the other hand, it only comes with a weaker (and not overclockable) Core i5-6500 CPU and misses out on an SSD, both of which are major scoring points in favor of the Titan Hadron. Final verdict There's a lot to like about the Titan Hadron. We found favor with its minimal, no-nonsense case that provides easy access to components and makes a refreshing change from conventional tower PCs. Nvidia's GTX 1060 has proven itself to be a great option for 1440p gaming, striking a balance between cost and performance, and the version with 6GB of video memory on offer here leaves you confident you can whack up the graphics options to hit that magic 60 fps mark. Its SSD provides nippy loading of files, and that overclockable CPU provides an avenue for more advanced gamers to eke out even more power. On the other hand, the machine is simply not up to the task of fluid 4K gaming on Ultra, or even High settings, depending on the title – you're going to need a machine like the StormForce Tornado with a GTX 1070 for that. And, considering the Titan Hadron costs more than a grand, that might be a deal-breaker for some.

It is only relevant for shared libraries developers, and even then, not always. However, I think it is beneficial for everyone to be familiar with how things work at a lower level, so I decided to write this post. A few weeks ago I got a report about an increase private dirty pages from our libraries that essentially caused increased memory consumption for every application linking to the EFL. The main culprit was the object system (Eo), which I maintain, so I decided to take a look. As the first step I manually reviewed the code. This led me to a mistake in related code which I eventually fixed. My fixes improved the situation a bit, but the main issue was still there. So I started investigating... Note: unless specifically mentioned otherwise, all of this post assumes Linux on Intel hardware, though while the details may vary, the concepts should apply almost everywhere. Introduction to Memory Pages in Linux First, if you are not familiar with the concept, read about the topic on Wikipedia. Pages are essentially blocks of virtual memory, and are the smallest unit of data being managed by the OS, in our case Linux. The page size is usually 4KiB, and is the case here. When an executable is being compiled, all of the information in it is being mapped to different sections depending on usage. For example with clang (may change based on compiler): static const int a = 5;
 will be mapped to .rodata, that is "read-only data". Another example is executable code (actual instructions) that would be mapped to .text. Then the linker decides how to map all of this into actual memory, and thus, into pages. Pages have permissions associated to them: read (R), write (W) and execute (X). For example, for security reasons, the stack is marked as RW, because you want to be able to read and write to the stack, but not executable in order to protect from a certain class of attacks. The actual executable code, is marked as RX, that is, you can read it, and execute it, but not modify it. A nice feature of non-writeable pages is that they never change (duh...), so the OS can reuse them and thus save memory. So for example, if your executable size is 2MiB, it'll be loaded into the memory once, it won't be loaded for every instance of the application. The OS is smart enough to share these pages. As a side note, Linux also implements Copy-on-Write for RW pages, so even if a page is RW, it may be shared across different instances assuming the data hasn't been written to. Pages that can be shared are called clean, and ones that have been written to are called dirty. There is more to be said about pages, but we've covered all we need in order to investigate the issue, so we will stop here. The Issue Reported Now that we know a bit more about pages we can more intelligently discuss the issue reported. The problem was that the EFL in general, and heavy users of Eo in particular, all of a sudden had a lot of private dirty pages. This means, a lot of pages of memory that are mapped from the library itself (in the executable, not allocated on runtime) that are being written to and thus can't be shared and have to be duplicated for each running process; a big issue for heavily used libraries. RW pages exist for a reason, so it could just be that these were legitimate usages, though judging by the amount of pages, this seemed unlikely. The first step was to find what is mapped to these pages, so I started there. Finding the Memory Users Unfortunately, while nm is a very useful command to mapping symbols to memory regions, so I know which symbols are mapped to RW pages (most likely); it doesn't (and can't) indicate which symbols map to dirty pages. Even more unfortunate is that I am not aware of any tool that provides that information (please let me know if you know of one!). I was just about to write one, when I saw that all of the relevant RW pages in my test case were dirty, so any memory in those would be relevant. Note: in order to check which variables got mapped to RW pages I used pmap. Using this tool I was able to see the address range for each page, and using some debug output I was able to get the addresses of the symbols in question and so was able to know which was stored in RW pages. Using pmap is very easy; more on that in the next section. I already knew which structures were the largest in Eo, so I decided to guess and see if they were mapped to RW pages or RO. My guess was spot on, and I found a few symbols that should be RO, but were actually RW. For example:  static const Efl_Event_Description *_event_desc[] = {
      // SNIP ...
 };
 This is a common mistake due to the confusing syntax C uses for const. This is an array of pointers to const Efl_Event_Description. This may look correct at first glance, until you realise the array itself is not constant. It should be:  static const Efl_Event_Description * const _event_desc[] = {
      // SNIP ...
 };
 This change saved us a few pages in the more event heavy areas, which is a first step, but the problem was still there, so the search recommenced. I then stumbled upon static const Efl_Class_Description _class_desc = {
    // SNIP ...
};
 This looks innocent. The Efl_Class_Description type is a struct, and const was correctly applied. This should have definitely been RO, but for some reason it was put in a RW page. Seeing this, and other similar structures, I knew I found what I was looking for, now I just needed to figure out why it was happening. After thinking about it for a bit, and considering a few different ideas, I suspected it was related to the fact that while these structures were constant, some of the fields were referring to other symbols, and in some cases, due to relocation, the linker would have to figure out the address at runtime, and thus won't be able to mark the pages as RO. This could be easily checked with nm, though I haven't thought about it at the time, so I went on investigating by other means. I ended up writing a small contained example, so I know if I was right or not. I ran my example in both gcc and clang. Unfortunately gcc gave me some less than optimal results, so I will use clang in my examples. Checking my Hypothesis In order to check my hypothesis I wrote a small program (issue.c): #include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define PAGE_SIZE 4096
#define ALLOC_SIZE (PAGE_SIZE * 1000)

typedef struct
{
   const void *invalidater;
   const char data[ALLOC_SIZE];
} Invalid;

static const char ro[ALLOC_SIZE];
static const Invalid rw = { NULL, { 0 }};

int main()
{
   printf("%zd\n", (size_t) getpid());
   printf("%p %p\n", ro, &rw); // So they are not optimised out
   scanf("\n"); // Keep the program running
   return 0;
}
 This program attempts to allocate two variables: ro: 1000 pages of read only memory. rw: 1000 pages (and one pointer) of read only memory that I suspected was going to be RW. Upon running it prints its PID and then waits. Now I can run it and inspect exactly what's going on. For that I will use pmap (and redact some of the non-relevant output). Let's compile and run our program: $ clang issue.c
$ ./a.out
11835
0x4006a0 0x7e86a0
 And then in another terminal: $ pmap 11835
11835:   ./a.out
0000000000400000   8004K r-x-- a.out
0000000000dd0000      4K rw--- a.out
 As you can see, both variables have been mapped to RO pages (the first). This is what we expected (which wasn't the case with GCC), because we don't rely on anything that we don't know on compile time. This was just a test to see everything works. Now we are going to change the program to check my hypothesis. We will change the NULL in the declaration of rw to some symbol which may be relocated, for example strlen, and then compile and run again: $ clang issue.c
$ ./a.out
11941
0x4006e0 0x7e86e0
 And then in another terminal: $ pmap 11941
11941:   ./a.out
0000000000400000   8004K r-x-- a.out
0000000000dd0000      4K rw--- a.out
 And... It still works. At this point I started to question myself, maybe I was wrong and something was going on. Then I realised there is still one thing that is different between my test case and libraries that exhibit the issue that may be related. They are libraries, and thus have position independent code, so I tested once more, this time with PIC enabled: $ clang issue.c -fPIC
$ ./a.out
12002
0x4006d0 0x9e8818
 And then in another terminal: $ pmap 12002
12002:   ./a.out
0000000000400000   4004K r-x-- a.out
00000000009e8000   4004K rw--- a.out
 Voila! We managed to replicate the issue. Verifying with nm As I mentioned before, this would have been easy to verify with nm, so I'll also show that for completeness. Though even with nm, I would have needed to enable PIC to trigger the issue. Relevant nm output for the RO (issue not present) case: $ nm -f sysv ./a.out
rw |07e86e0| r | OBJECT|03e8008| |.rodata
 As you can see, rw is put into the .rodata section, that is read-only data. Relevant nm output for the RW (issue present) case: $ nm -f sysv ./a.out
rw |09e8818| d | OBJECT|03e8008| |.data.rel.ro
 Here, rw is put into the .data.rel.ro section, which is a section that is read-only after relocation, which means, not read-only. My Pages are RO and not RW I got reports from two different people (thanks Daniel Hirt and Mark Mossberg!) that their pmap output looked something like this: $ pmap 10214
10214:   ./a.out
0000000000400000   4004K r-x-- a.out
00000000009e8000   4004K r---- a.out
0000000000dd1000      4K rw--- a.out
 The reason for that is most likely linker differences. One way to verify this is indeed the case: $ strace ./a.out
... SNIP ...
mprotect(0x9e8000, 4100096, PROT_READ)  = 0
... SNIP ...
 As you can see, the program is calling mprotect to change the page (look at the address) to be RO. If you read the previous section about nm, you probably saw rw was put into the "read-only after relocation" section, which means the linker was allowed and encouraged to mark the pages read-only after it has finished the relocation updates. As mentioned above, I took a short-cut checking for RW pages instead of private dirty pages because I had complete overlap between the two. This short-cut may not work for your case, though the nm output should still give you the information you need. Solving the Issue Two solutions come to mind. Either separate the "truly constant" values from the relocatable values. So for example, if we had a struct like: struct {
     int ro;
     void *symbol;
};
 Split it to two separate structs. Or alternatively, reconsider parts of the design, maybe using the pointers in the struct is not even needed and it's enough to pass them to a function. This way the structures won't be mapped to RW memory, but would be temporarily stored on the stack before the function invocation, reducing the memory usage. I have already reduced some memory in Eo users by using the second method. I will soon complement that with the first method to reduce it even further. Preliminary tests show significant reduction in memory usage, so a big win. Lessons Learned While I knew the theory behind it, I was surprised to see how code I assumed would be mapped to RO pages ended up in RW pages that get dirty immediately. More specifically, that any structure that has a pointer to anything, even to a constant string, like: static const char * const rw = "test";
 would end up in RW pages. Review your libraries and make sure you are not wasting memory, and remember that heap memory is not the only memory that can be wasted. Please let me know if you spotted any mistakes or have any suggestions for improvement. © Tom Hacohen

In the fourth quarter of 2015, the worldwide wearable device market took a big step forward primarily led by the growing popularity of fitness trackers and the Apple Watch. According to the International Data Corporation, vendors shipped a total of 78.1 million units in 2015, an increase of 171.6% over 2014. The company found that wearables can exist and are welcome in the mass market, leaving substantial room for growth in multiple areas including new vendors, form factors, applications, and uses. Their analysts forecast that in addition to tracking information like steps taken and calories burned, fitness wearables will include predictive information that suggest ways users can lead healthier lives, integrate with popular applications and social media, and embrace new form factors like clothing, footwear and eyewear. This not only will drive market growth but expand the fitness wearables patent landscape. There are several companies that share the majority of the revenue in the fitness wearable market, with  Fitbit being the worldwide leader along with Apple, Xiami, Samsung, Garmin, Nike, Sony, and Google. Figure 1, Fitbit Fitness Wearables Patent Analysis Gartner lists six companies that share the majority of the revenue in the fitness wearable market: Samsung, Nike, Garmin,  Fitbit, Sony, and Google. To create patent analysis models, the technologies of the products made by these companies were considered, characterized, and refined by applying a set of about 100 keyword phrases to the patent portfolios. These refined keywords were applied to all US patents, to determine what other companies may have patents that are applicable to these products and services. Over 300 companies were considered. The results for a selection of these companies are shown below with the six leading companies in bold and medical companies listed in red. Figure 3, Snapshot of Technology Patents and Applications in the Fitness Wearables Market Near the top of the list we find several older established companies (Samsung, Microsoft, Apple, Qualcomm, Intel and Philips) that have diversified into wearables. The top six wearables companies here range from diversifying companies like Google, Samsung, and Sony, a diverse apparel company Nike, and focused wearable companies Garmin and particularly  Fitbit. The focused wearable companies tend to be at the bottom of the list, where a larger percentage of their portfolio applies to the wearable market. Finally, the patents found for power, processor, and wireless are more about using and integrating these technologies, rather than fundamentally building them. How recent are the applications and patents found in the patent study? Figure 4, IoT Wearables Granted and Applications Patents by Publication Year Histograms of the age of these patents bear out further observations (Figure 4). Most clearly, the rate of innovation in sensor systems is growing both in terms of applications and allowed patents. Sensors are not simply a clever component that senses the environment. Increasingly today they are systems combining several sensors for different environmental aspects into a microcontroller and analog to digital converter to provide a digital output. Growth of Innovation In 2015, the wearables segment was dominated by smart watches, fitness bands, smart glasses and Bluetooth headsets. The total 2016 market for this segment is estimated to be $28.7 billion US dollars. The growth of innovation in sensor systems, and the current level of market revenue suggest that we are still a year or two away from the first licensing cycle in wearables market. Recently, we tore down 12 wearable products. We discovered socket wins for 41 companies led by Texas Instruments (41), STM (11), and Qualcomm (7). Sensor wins were led by STM, Samsung, and nine others while sensor systems were led by AKM, Texas Instruments (TI), Invensense, and four others. TI, Maxim, and 10 others led the use of power management devices, processors were led by TI, STM, and 13 others, radios were led by Nordic, Broadcom, TI, and six others and other functions were delivered by 16 different companies. The diversity of technologies, the innovations in low power and analytics and the wealth of established technology that is being repurposed for this market indicates that there will be strong licensing positions held by a wide assortment of well established companies. Companies entering the market will have to prepare for licensing by driving their rate of patent applications, purchasing patents, taking licenses or being acquired as part of a round of market consolidation.  Fitness Wearables Company Patent Portfolios The companies examined in the initial patent study fall into several groups regarding their position in the market and licensing positions. Newer companies like  Fitbit and Garmin, which are successful in the wearables market are just starting to build their portfolios. Others, like Nike and Google, are successful in other markets and have diversified into the wearables market. Using Our Patent Analytics solution powered by KMX, we visualized the patent diversity for group of these patents. Each dot represents a patent, a group of patents sharing similar keywords creates a peak, and each peak indicates the top three keywords found in patent cluster. Patent clusters that are significantly different are further apart and may be separated by white space. We developed models that separate patents into four areas based on the type of analysis required to prove the claim. Process (yellow), which refers to structure and materials, physical properties of the materials, and mechanical aspects Package (green), which includes mechanical assemblies interfacing the physical and electrical domain Circuit (blue), which refers to electronic schematics of PCB, packages, or semiconductor die, and range from transistors to common circuits like amplifiers, PLLs, converters, and digital logic System (red), which includes the operation of products, where several separated blocks are combined to deliver a feature or function, either at the electrical, data, or software levels In the following landscapes, patents applicable to wearables are painted black, and are similar to one or more of our models for sensor, sensor systems, power, process, radio, and product features. A Closer Look At  Fitbit Consider  Fitbit (Figure 5). Their portfolio is relatively new with 81 US applications, 69 recent granted patents, and eight design patents. The structure of the portfolio appears to be centered on notifications, with four branches related to the monitoring fitness and activity, geo-location, heart rate, and biometrics in a portable fashion.  As an example, the top 15 keywords among many for peak “coupon apparatus page” are shown. About 58% of the portfolio is found to be similar to our six models for wearables. This is a high percentage, suggesting that this is the primary market for  Fitbit. Most  Fitbit patents are systems related; perhaps only a handful are strongly circuit in nature. This implies that  Fitbit is an integrator, combining its own building blocks or those from other companies to create a higher value end product. Fitbit may be in a good position for licensing negotiations, as their portfolio of recent systems patents may patent high-level value features of the recent innovations marketed in this wave of wearable products. Figure 5, Fitbit Wearables Patent Landscape A Closer Look at Microsoft Microsoft’s portfolio consists of 8,696 applications, 25,677 patents, and 3,692 design patents. Their portfolio consists mostly of software patents, with about 300 patents that are circuit related that are likely related to their Xbox gaming system, which includes Kinect and handheld peripherals. About 962 Microsoft patents are similar to the six wearables models in the initial study.  These patents are painted black in the full portfolio on the bottom left of Figure 8, are widely distributed. This suggests these patents are diverse in technology and may cover a broad range of technologies in wearables products. A landscape was created of only the 962 patents found to be potentially applicable to wearables, in the right half of Figure 8. The top right area generally surrounding and above peak “image motion point” is about sensors and sensor systems, and many of the product features of Things. The left side around peak “event query search” combines sensor systems and processing. The bottom area, generally around and below peak “message activity service,” describe interactions of communication, wireless, and power. Considering that Microsoft also has a very wide range of other technologies innovations patented, they would have the best position leveraging the wearables market among all companies considered in this study. Figure 8, Microsoft Wearables Patent Landscape Conclusion The fitness wearables market is driving millions of shipments per year in silicon and devices. By 2019, IDC predicts that the worldwide wearables market will grow to around 155.7 million units. In addition to driving revenues — the fitness wearables market alone is projected to reach nearly $30 billion US dollars in 2016 as noted. The patent licensing landscape for this market is on the verge of explosive growth, especially since many of the patents used in IoT technology are nearly 20 years old. Many companies new to the IoT market may have strong and expansive portfolio positions for assertion. Even so, understanding the market players, their experience, and their patents in similar products is vital in creating a product and IP strategy that can deliver a high return in the IoT market.

Nouveau Gets A LED Driver To Control Light-Up GeForce Logos Written by Michael Larabel in Nouveau on 24 August 2016 at 09:16 AM EDT. 19 Comments For those with a TITAN X or other high-end GPUs that have a configurable light-up "GeForce" LED sign along the edge of the graphics card, a new Nouveau driver allows manipulating those LEDs. Martin Peres of Intel OTC who continues hacking on Nouveau in his spare time received a donation of a GeForce GTX TITAN graphics card. He decided to play around with the "useless" feature of being able to manipulate the brightness of the LEDs powering this light-up display. He's written a basic LED driver that hooks up to the LED subsystem and in turn allowing to sync the blinking to the CPU/disk/network activity or other manual controls. Martin noted with the fun patch where he implemented this LED control support in less than 200 lines of code, "Users may also implement some breathing effect or morse code support in the userspace if they feel like it." This configurable LED support for the GeForce logo has long been exposed under Windows on supported hardware. 19 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

(PRNewsFoto/UBM EMEA Routes Ltd) MANCHESTER, England, August 24, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- One of the rising stars of the Chinese economy, the emerging city of Chengdu, will move closer towards its ambition of becoming the main transport hub for western China when it hosts the World Routes aviation forum next month (24-27 September).      (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150730/250177LOGO ) World Routes is an annual event that brings together airlines, airports, tourism authorities and governments to plan new air services. It travels to a new location every year to stimulate different aviation markets. This year's host city, Chengdu, is the capital of Sichuan Province and one of the fastest developing cities in the world. Chengdu's GDP increased by 7.9% in 2015 to over 1.08 trillion Yuan (1.1% higher than the national average) and 271 Fortune 500 companies including IBM, Intel and Microsoft are based in the city. Chengdu's tourism industry is also booming. Around 2.3 million oversea visitors travelled there last year (16.3% more than 2014) to see attractions such as the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding where pandas have been brought back from the brink of extinction. The host of World Routes 2016, Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport, is already mainland China's fourth busiest airport with over 50 airlines serving 199 destinations. Last year the airport handled 42 million passengers and this number is expected to reach 45 million by the end of 2016. Direct international routes include San Francisco, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London, Moscow, Paris and Melbourne. China is investing massively in aviation to create a one trillion yuan ($153.8 billion) market by 2020. A construction programme will increase the number of airports from 300 to 500, one of which will be in Chengdu. It will be the one of only three cities in China to have two airports (along with Beijing and Shanghai) when Chengdu Tianfu International opens in 2020. Chengdu has 3,000 years of history and was part of the ancient network of Silk Road trade routes. President Xi Jinping's 'One Belt, One Road' strategy aims to create a modern day Silk Road through improved transport connections to western Asian, the Middle East and Europe, putting Chengdu in an even stronger position to bid for increased air services. Adrian Newton, group director at UBM EMEA, the organiser of World Routes, said: "Chengdu is a prosperous city with massive potential for the aviation industry. Our delegates are excited to explore the opportunities created by Chengdu's powerful economy and the desire to create more international air services." Some of the biggest international airlines have registered for World Routes including Air China, American Airlines, British Airways, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Iberia, Japan Airlines, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Lufthansa and Qantas.

Five 'regional' route development forums are held between February and June in the Americas, Asia, Europe and Africa, with the flagship World Routes event taking place in September. http://www.routesonline.com The events revolve around pre-scheduled meetings and an exhibition and conference which are delivered in partnership with host stakeholders. Hosts tend to be a collaboration between airports, tourism authorities and investment partners (the bidding process takes place two to three years before the event takes place). Routes was founded in 1995 and is part of the EMEA division of UBM plc.

A total of 15 companies will participate, including telecommunication providers SK Telecom, AT&T, Deutsche Telekom and China Mobile, and device manufacturers Ericsson, Nokia, Samsung, Huawei, Intel and LG. The cooperative body will discuss ways to ensure interoperability with existing networks, including fourth-generation long term evolution, or LTE, networks. The group is also expected to discuss early-stage system standards for 5G as well as ways to further develop the technology. The fifth-generation mobile network is expected have higher internet connection speeds along with other improvements such as expanded coverage and higher signal efficiency. The new body will have a consultative relationship with an existing international organization called the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), which has been authorized to set telecommunications standards and hopes to establish initial standards for 5G networks by 2018. Industry experts are now focused on how the newly-formed cooperative body will affect decisions by 3GPP. While 3GPP has already begun discussions this year on 5G standardization, it will take time as it plans to establish standards in stages. Once all details of the standards are set, commercialization of 5G will begin. “To successfully commercialize 5G and take the lead in longer-term technological developments after the launch of 5G, cooperation with global telecommunication providers and device manufacturers is a must,” said Park Jin-hyo, head of SK Telecom’s network technology research and development center. SK Telecom has been working with device makers such as Ericsson, Nokia and Samsung to jointly develop devices and technology for 5G.

(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150730/250177LOGO ) World Routes is an annual event that brings together airlines, airports, tourism authorities and governments to plan new air services. It travels to a new location every year to stimulate different aviation markets. This year's host city, Chengdu, is the capital of Sichuan Province and one of the fastest developing cities in the world. Chengdu's GDP increased by 7.9% in 2015 to over 1.08 trillion Yuan (1.1% higher than the national average) and 271 Fortune 500 companies including IBM, Intel and Microsoft are based in the city. Chengdu's tourism industry is also booming. Around 2.3 million oversea visitors travelled there last year (16.3% more than 2014) to see attractions such as the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding where pandas have been brought back from the brink of extinction. The host of World Routes 2016, Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport, is already mainland China's fourthbusiest airport with over 50 airlines serving 199 destinations. Last year the airport handled 42 million passengers and this number is expected to reach 45 million by the end of 2016. Direct international routes include San Francisco, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London, Moscow, Paris and Melbourne. China is investing massively in aviation to create a one trillion yuan ($153.8 billion) market by 2020. A construction programme will increase the number of airports from 300 to 500, one of which will be in Chengdu. It will be the one of only three cities in China to have two airports (along with Beijing and Shanghai) when Chengdu Tianfu International opens in 2020. Chengdu has 3,000 years of history and was part of the ancient network of Silk Road trade routes. PresidentXi Jinping's 'One Belt, One Road' strategy aims to create a modern day Silk Road through improved transport connections to western Asian, the Middle East and Europe, putting Chengdu in an even stronger position to bid for increased air services. Adrian Newton, group director at UBM EMEA, the organiser of World Routes, said: "Chengdu is a prosperous city with massive potential for the aviation industry. Our delegates are excited to explore the opportunities created by Chengdu's powerful economy and the desire to create more international air services." Some of the biggest international airlines have registered for World Routes including Air China, American Airlines, British Airways, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Iberia, Japan Airlines, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Lufthansa and Qantas.

Join For Free What every Java engineer should know about microservices: Reactive Microservices Architecture.  Brought to you in partnership with Lightbend. The new JDK™ 9 early access release contains a JDK enhancement proposal JEP 143, Improve Contended Locking, to improve the performance of contended monitors. Monitors are used by the Java synchronized statement to lock access to a code block. If the synchronized block is called by several threads, the monitor becomes contended. This can degrade performance dramatically. So let us look at the performance improvements of contended monitors. The graphic shows the time of one method call. The lower numbers mean better performance. The test consists of 8 threads accessing a synchronized block, and all threads are accessing the same monitor. You can download the test here. The test was run on an Intel i5 4 core CPU. As we can see, JDK 9 improves the performance of contended monitors. Let us now look at a direct comparison between JDK 8 and 9. Comparison Between JDK 8 and JDK 9 The following shows how much improvement the switch from JDK 8 to JDK 9 will bring. The graphic shows the time of one method call for a contended monitor at different threads. As we see the performance of JDK 9 degrades mutch slower than the performance from JDK 8. One advice to improve the performance is to use reentrant locks instead of synchronized blocks. So let us see if this advice is still true for JDK 9. Reentrant Locks vs. Synchronized Let us look at the performance of a contended reentrant lock vs. a contended monitor of a synchronized block. The graphics show the time of one method call at different threads. As we see in JDK 9, the performance of the synchronized statements is almost as fast as the reentrant locks. Conclusion As we have seen, JDK 9 improves the performance of contended monitors. In JDK 9 contended monitors are almost as fast as contended reentrant locks, but JDK 9 also has a JDK enhancement proposal JEP 285, Spin-Wait Hints, to improve the performance of locks. I will look at this in the next article on this blog. Besides testing the performance of multithreaded code you should also test the correctness of your multithreaded code. Read more about a new way to unit test your multithreaded application. If you have a question or remark please add a comment below. Microservices for Java, explained.

The tie-up is the latest between automakers and tech companies hoping to speed driverless cars to market. Here’s a rundown of who’s working with whom: UBER/VOLVO/TOYOTA/OTTO Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies and Volvo Cars signed a $300 million deal for Volvo to provide SUVs to Uber for autonomous vehicle research. The Volvo SUVs will be part of Uber’s self-driving fleet of taxis in Pittsburgh. Both companies will continue to develop autonomous vehicles separately. Uber also is buying Otto, a startup that has developed software that lets big rigs drive autonomously. Earlier this year, Toyota Motor Corp. bought a small stake in Uber for an undisclosed amount. LYFT/GENERAL MOTORS/CRUISE AUTOMATION General Motors Co. invested $500 million in Uber rival Lyft Inc. earlier this year. The companies are developing a fleet of autonomous electric taxis that could be deployed through Lyft within the next year. GM also acquired Cruise Automation, a startup that makes autonomous vehicle software, for $581 million. LYFT/DIDI CHUXING/UBER/APPLE Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing invested $100 million in Lyft last fall. The partnership allows U.S. customers use the Lyft app to hail Didi rides while in China and vice versa. Uber recently complicated that deal by selling its China business to Didi in exchange for an 18-percent stake in the Chinese company. And there’s another wrinkle: Apple Inc., which is believed to be working on its own autonomous cars, invested $1 billion in Didi in May. GOOGLE/FIAT CHRYSLER Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which has been working on self-driving cars since 2009, is working with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to build 100 self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans. The vans will let Google double the size of its autonomous test fleet. VOLKSWAGEN/GETT Volkswagen AG invested $300 million in Uber competitor Gett Inc. in May. Gett said it would provide Volkswagen with the technology to expand beyond car ownership and into ride- and car-sharing. BMW/INTEL/MOBILEYE BMW AG, Intel Corp. and Israel’s Mobileye NV are teaming up to build and commercialize driverless cars. The companies say they could have autonomous vehicles in production by 2021. BMW’s iNext electric sedan will serve as the platform for the technology. Intel makes the computer processors necessary to operate self-driving cars, while Mobileye makes advanced camera systems. The vehicles would likely be used by ride-sharing fleets. FORD/VELODYNE/BAIDU Ford Motor Co. is aiming to have fully self-driving cars – with no steering wheels or pedals – in ride-sharing fleets by 2021. Ford and Chinese search engine company Baidu Inc. – which has also invested in Uber – are investing $150 million in Velodyne, which makes the laser sensors that help guide self-driving cars. Ford also acquired Israel-based SAIPS for its expertise in artificial intelligence and computer vision, and invested in Berkeley, California-based Civil Maps. AUDI/MERCEDES/BMW/HERE Last fall, Nokia Corp. sold its digital mapping business, Here, to a consortium of German automakers for $3 billion. Audi, BMW and Mercedes say precise maps are a key to developing autonomous cars as well as advanced driver assistance features. NISSAN/NASA Under a five-year partnership, researchers from Nissan and NASA are working on autonomous driving systems and human-machine interface projects with software that can be used on both cars and planetary rovers. Nissan hopes to have self-driving cars on the road by 2020. Copyright 2016 Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

Join For Free Discover how AppDynamics steps in to upgrade your performance game and prevent your enterprise from these top 10 Java performance problems, brought to you in partnership with AppDynamics. The new JDK™ 9 early access release contains a JDK enhancement proposal JEP 143, Improve Contended Locking, to improve the performance of contended monitors. Monitors are used by the Java synchronized statement to lock access to a code block. If the synchronized block is called by several threads, the monitor becomes contended. This can degrade performance dramatically. So let us look at the performance improvements of contended monitors. The graphic shows the time of one method call. The lower numbers mean better performance. The test consists of 8 threads accessing a synchronized block, and all threads are accessing the same monitor. You can download the test here. The test was run on an Intel i5 4 core CPU. As we can see, JDK 9 improves the performance of contended monitors. Let us now look at a direct comparison between JDK 8 and 9. Comparison Between JDK 8 and JDK 9 The following shows how much improvement the switch from JDK 8 to JDK 9 will bring. The graphic shows the time of one method call for a contended monitor at different threads. As we see the performance of JDK 9 degrades mutch slower than the performance from JDK 8. One advice to improve the performance is to use reentrant locks instead of synchronized blocks. So let us see if this advice is still true for JDK 9. Reentrant Locks vs. Synchronized Let us look at the performance of a contended reentrant lock vs. a contended monitor of a synchronized block. The graphics show the time of one method call at different threads. As we see in JDK 9, the performance of the synchronized statements is almost as fast as the reentrant locks. Conclusion As we have seen, JDK 9 improves the performance of contended monitors. In JDK 9 contended monitors are almost as fast as contended reentrant locks, but JDK 9 also has a JDK enhancement proposal JEP 285, Spin-Wait Hints, to improve the performance of locks. I will look at this in the next article on this blog. Besides testing the performance of multithreaded code you should also test the correctness of your multithreaded code.

Google Pixel: Devices are a dangerous distraction from the new AI interface Will 5G give Samsung a chance at global Radio Access Network glory? Google’s latest operating system project, Fuchsia, may be largely a mystery, but it reinforces a truth that platform vendors are having, grudgingly, to acknowledge: one operating system does not fit all. For a company which has put so much effort into making Android an OS for all purposes, Google has a remarkable number of potentially conflicting platforms, now including Chrome OS, Brillo and Fuchsia. Even though it looks like an experimental OS for embedded devices, Fuchsia was described by its own Google team as being designed for “modern phones and modern personal computers”, which might be just how Android and Chrome OS would describe themselves too. So is Google hedging its bets, extending Android to cars, homes and wearables while developing alternatives just in case? Or is there a more coordinated master plan at work? The failure of one-size-fits-all OSs Many companies, of course, develop parallel systems, creating dilemmas for the marketing departments – especially companies with a culture of innovation and semi-open source activity like Google (though the same parallelism used to characterize the far more controlled Samsung too). But Google’s multi-headed OS hydra may well have a greater commercial logic behind it. If it can create a fully optimized platform for each key emerging area of connected experience, and then marry them all together at the applications layer with the ubiquitous Android, it might achieve what Unix, Linux and Java promised, but failed to deliver all these years. All those, not to mention the proprietary unified OS attempts like successive generations of Windows, ran up against the huge challenges of extending a single OS across very different hardware systems, user and developer communities, and user experiences. The fragmentation becomes even worse with the rise of a new host of connected devices, and companies which missed out on the mobile market because of Android’s dominance have been eagerly grasping the opportunity to devise a fully optimized software environment for virtual reality headsets, for smart clothing, for industrial robots, for drones, for car dashboards, for connected light switches. Can all these target devices, and many more, with their very varied screens, interfaces and applications, really be served by one OS? No, say the firms whom Android pushed aside, such as Samsung with Tizen and Huawei with LiteOS. Google increasingly seems to be saying no too, despite the proliferation of new Android strands for specific device types. Chrome OS enables devices – initially lightweight laptops but now streaming gadgets like Chromecast and others – which are inherently cloud-connected, while Android, in its commercial implementations, is optimal with downloads and offline/online. Then there is Brillo for embedded, ultra-low power devices – it is used in the Google Wi-Fi OnHub while its associated application layer framework, Weave, is used by the Nest home devices subsidiary, along with the Thread connectivity protocol – and access to Android apps and services. This is the key – different OSs, but with various levels of integration with the huge Android base of developers and applications. Brillo is essentially a stripped-down version of Android, while Chrome OS is entirely separate, based on the Chromium code base which is increasingly strategic to Google (it also underpins the browser and the CoreOS containers). But Chrome OS has also become increasingly entwined with Android, enabling Chromebook users to harness those apps and offline services too. Fuchsia’s early details The details of Fuchsia are few and far between at this early stage, but it appears to be an ambitious project, with one core component drawing a lot of attention – it won’t be using the Linux kernel at all. It appeared on GitHub with just the description "Pink + Purple = Fuchsia (a new Operating System)". It can be trialled on an ARM or Intel computer or a virtual machine, and its next port is said to be to a Raspberry Pi to test its low power credentials further. It uses Google’s own Dart programming language. While a non-Linux OS might be commonplace for very low end embedded devices, Fuchsia is more than a simple RTOS (real time OS), since it has "grown-up" capabilities such as advanced graphics and 64-bit support and a capability-based security model. This points to an attempt to create a Linux-free OS and potentially create a whole new approach to open OS development (and IPR) a quarter-century after Linus Torvalds made his breakthrough. Fuchsia will run on the newly developed Magenta kernel (based on the Little Kernel project), instead of the Linux kernel that forms the heart of all Linux distros – including Android and Chromium. As such, Google’s new OS looks like it will be entirely homegrown. The GitHub repository notes “LK is a kernel designed for small systems typically used in embedded applications. On the other hand, Magenta targets modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of RAM, with arbitrary peripherals doing open-ended computation.” Whether that makes it more efficient than the Linux kernel remains to be seen – after all, that codebase has existed for quite a long time now, but has been the source of near constant development from the open source community. Those open source advocates are likely going to be quite uncomfortable with a Googlespawned OS, but for Alphabet itself, there might be some strategic advantages to the homebrew platform. This would most likely be targeted, in its commercial stages, to compete with the rising number of specialized lightweight systems which sit somewhere between a full platform and a real time OS (RTOS) like VxWorks. The latter’s developer, Intel unit Wind River, is playing in this space, as is ARM with mBED OS, and up the stack a little, there are numerous vendor efforts like Tizen, and open source alternatives. The Magenta kernel has been designed to compete at the RTOS end, against the likes of FreeRTOS and ThreadX, which are operating systems designed for devices that are incredibly hardwareconstrained – and thus more likely to be found in remote IoT deployments. These embedded devices often use non-Linux kernels, and so that realm won’t be too unnerved by Google’s proposition. How far will Fuchsia cannibalize Android, or ride on it? But Magenta is also being built to scale up to far more powerful compute platforms such as phones and PCs, so if it succeeds there in future, Google will have to make difficult decisions about the risks of moving away from Linux; the level to which Magenta would be allowed to cannibalize Android; and how the two OSs could be converged. It seems impossible that the company would throw away the ingrained advantage that its Android base brings it, whether in embedded devices or new generation smartphones. Fuchsia could conceivably be the basis of something like Android 7.0, or rather the open source AOSP component that underlines the OS itself, but it is more likely that Google will work on enabling Fuchsia developers and users to have Android compatibility where required. But the sheer amount of work and risk to replace Android – even if Fuchsia proves more optimal for upcoming user experiences; even if the replacement takes place over many years – is daunting. Far better to keep Fuchsia focused on powering embedded or hardware- constrained devices at the network edge, and reworking Android as radically as necessary to enable it to leave iOS in the dust when mobile users start to embrace new experiences driven by hyper-contextual awareness, AI-driven search and query, voice and image recognition, and virtual/augmented reality. The old OSs and tools will struggle to keep pace with all that, and Google may be recognizing this – in far better time than Microsoft did with Windows as the web and then the mobile eras dawned. But on phones and PCs, it is already introducing software which will revolutionize Android and Chrome without the need for a brand new platform. Project Tango has had a rocky start, but promises augmented reality experiences which will become as natural to the user as the search box and the maps tools are today. And as part of the Chromium project, Google is working on bringing VR support to its Chrome browser, a move which could help transform the web and mobile experience. According to Google’s Francois Beaufort, the Chrome Beta and Chrome Dev channels have a setting that “allows users to browse the web while using Cardboard or Daydream-ready viewers”. Daydream is the VR platform which Google unveiled at its I/O conference this year, while Cardboard is its low cost technology for turning a handset into a VR viewer. These are the projects which will change the rules in the next phase of mobile and IoT usage, and will help to tie users and OEMs into Android, reluctantly or not. It seems impossible that Google would sabotage all that with yet another PC/phone OS, while in the embedded world, it may have a chance to burrow far more deeply into the IoT and all its many devices than it can with Android. The Fuchsia team A selection of the leaders of the Fuchsia development indicates the broad operating system heritage, spanning more than two decades and several iconic platforms, which is being tapped for Google’s latest adventure: Travis Geiselbrecht: worked on the failed but hugely influential BeOS from the 1990s as well as iOS and Danger’s Hiptop product, which was later acquired by Microsoft. Brian Swetland: also worked on BeOS and Hiptop, but has spent many years on the Android core too. Chris McKillop: yet another Hiptop alumnus and a member of the original iPhone team. He was also an original member of a team which created webOS – later owned by Palm and then Hewlett-Packard – and contributed to the QNX automotive OS which was acquired by BlackBerry. Adam Barth: a long-serving member of Google’s Chrome team who also built his own OS, called Tau. Most recently, he has helped develop Google’s Flutter tool which aims to make it easier to write software to run on both Android and iOS.

Set caching to this drive, render out to this drive. OR, would it make sense to have large/comlex media such as 6K R3D files reading from this drive? For short commercial projects, the selects would not be over 500GB I don't think. OR would it be much better to have the PCIe SSD as the system drive? And not cache to it, I'd figure out a different idea for caching. I don't know what it would speed up over the regular SSD other than boot up times?

Those uncompressed UHD files can be 1GB+ per sec, so your SSD can fit only a few minutes of footage.     #4   Milano Questa View Profile View Forum Posts Private Message Senior Member Join Date Jan 2013 Posts 292 08-24-2016, 05:52 AM You need about 2gb Ram per core to get most out of your CPU.     #5   Ben Miller View Profile View Forum Posts Private Message Junior Member Join Date Nov 2012 Location Los Angeles, CA Posts 17 08-24-2016, 02:16 PM I'm going to 2nd Peter here. If youre spending that much on processors, upgrade the video cards. And you can NEVER have a SSD that is too fast. Is Xeon even worth it? Check this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b36UZrx4gpY     #6   Martin Landsburg View Profile View Forum Posts Private Message Member Join Date Oct 2010 Posts 51 08-24-2016, 11:13 PM Thanks for all the feedback so far! I'm mainly building a system that can handle R3D's well, and perform in at least workable level with Neat Video on a 4K timeline. With 6K R3D's, my new (now old) Mac Pro cylinder would often crash, or at best render at below half a frame per second. I then did a test with a variety of setups at a place that builds medium-high end work stations, dual 6-core (all they had in stock at the time) with an M6000 Quadro, a GTX 1070 and RX480. The RX480 was twice as fast with Neat Video, and equal to both cards without. 6K Full Debayer, lowest compression on a 25p and one 50p clip. 15.5 fps no neat video for all cards. M6000: 1.2 fps with Neat Video. RX480 was 2.7 fps. After Effects used to require 2GB per core ...not sure how it is now without hyperthreading, not an AE guy but I heard it's in a massive overhaul of the core engine so may take a while to optimally use system resources? Again, this machine is for Resolve only. Also, from scouring forums, I gathered that R3D in particular benefit more from more cores vs higher clock speed as Davinci is a multi-threaded app that scales up to as many cores are available. The dual 6-cores were all maxed out to 100% during playback, no grades applied. I got a good deal on second hand OEM (with warranty), dual CPUs for $700 so it is cheaper than a 8-core or 10-core i7. Thanks for that youtube link though, that is the CPU model I bought 2x of. From his test, it still beat the i7, and it was a single Xeon, not dual. Will see how it fares!

I did several tests and got quite good results without Neat Video. Realtime 25fps playback of 6K 6144x4140 timeline, 6K 50fps R3D clip in Full Res Premium 10-bit after a bit of tweaking with the bios (turbo boost on). With Neat Video, I got good results within the preferences>performance tab, up to 5.75 fps on a 4K timeline. (This is much better than the 1.2fps Quadro M6000 or 0.7fps GTX 1070 that I tested btw!) However, in actual playback, it would get me 1-2fps, maybe 3fps, but grind to a halt halfway through the clip. This may be because Davinci doesn't see all of the GPUs? AMD panel shows one GPU as Primary, with the other two showing up but marked as (disabled). GPU-Z and system manager show no issues. notes: GPU usage during the neatvideo test averaged no more than 15%, CPU usage on turbo only 54% RAM only 8GB of usage with 24GB free     #8   Matthew Riggieri View Profile View Forum Posts Private Message Senior Member Join Date Oct 2008 Location Baltimore, MD Posts 358 09-06-2016, 10:15 AM Do you have the full version of resolve?     #9   Martin Landsburg View Profile View Forum Posts Private Message Member Join Date Oct 2010 Posts 51 09-06-2016, 10:16 AM Yes, listed under system specs.     #10   Martin Landsburg View Profile View Forum Posts Private Message Member Join Date Oct 2010 Posts 51 09-06-2016, 11:58 PM As further notes: Pre-allocated memory set to 4000 MB No SLI or crossfire Only one monitor attached to one of the GPUs     Page 1 of 2 12 Last Jump to page: Quick Navigation DaVinci Top Site Areas Settings Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home Forums Red Digital Cinema Recon NAB 2016 DRAGON WEAPON RAVEN RED DISCUSSION Crucial Ordnance EPIC-M OWNERS The DSMC System EPIC RED ONE SCARLET REDLINK DEVELOPERS .

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending MacBook Pro Nintendo Switch Google Pixel iOS 10.1 PS4 Pro All Black Friday Deals Reviews StormForce Tornado review StormForce Tornado review By Kane Fulton PC & Mac desktops  1440p and Ultra HD gaming for under a grand Shares Recommended Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Verdict If you're looking to dive into 1440p and 4K gaming for under a grand, the StormForce Tornado is an attractive choice. Its Nvidia GTX 1070 GPU brings sublime performance, though you might want to add an SSD for extra speed. For 1440p and 4K gaming power Attractive design Plenty of drive bays Good selection of ports Against Hard disk increases wait times Can't turn blue lighting off There's rarely a better time to buy a new pre-built gaming PC than following the launch of a new generation of graphics cards. Pascal is Nvidia's most interesting GPU architecture in some time, if not ever, representing a true generational leap over its predecessor, Maxwell. 14 Nvidia Pascal laptops to up your mobile game The StormForce Tornado comes with the new GTX 1070, which sits in the middle of the Nvidia's triumvirate of Pascal cards alongside the GTX 1060 and GTX 1080. StormForce has twinned the GPU with components that allow for excellent performance at 1080p and beyond. There's even enough grunt for VR and 4K gaming - though you'll have to dial the settings down a notch or two depending on the game for the latter. It can be pre-ordered online for £899 (around $1,180/AUS$1,540) and is set to be released on September 1. Feel the force It's amazing what a change of color can do for a chassis. Decked in white with black external drive bays, this Tornado Gaming Case is much more attractive than the dour all-black version used by ZooStorm, StormForce's sister brand, for previous builds. If a StormTrooper wanted a rig to match their body armor, this might be it. The case's appearance is made more interesting by a mesh design on the front panel, which lights up two fans blowing cool air out of the front with a blue hue. Unfortunately we couldn't find a way to disable the lighting, which is annoying if you want to leave the machine on overnight. The case has a very plastic feel, but it's practical. Removing two screws provides access to the components inside, in addition to three clips that allow the front panel to be taken off and cleaned. Spec sheet Here is the StormForce Tornado configuration sent to TechRadar for review: CPU: 2.7GHz Intel Core-i5 6400 (3.3GHz using Turbo Boost; dual-core, 6MB cache) Graphics: KFA2 GeForce GTX 1070 Standard Graphics Card (8GB GDDR5 RAM) RAM: 16GB DDR4 (2,400MHz) Storage: 1TB SATA (7,200rpm) Optical drive: Yes Ports: 1 x PS/2 keyboard/mouse port, 2 x USB 3.0 ports (front), 1 x USB 2.0 port (front), 2 x USB 2.0 ports (rear), 4 x USB 3.1 ports (rear), 4 x USB 3.1 ports (rear), 1 x HDMI, 1 x VGA, 1 x DVI-D, 1 x LAN (RJ45), 3 x audio jacks Connectivity: 2 x USB 3.0, 1 x USB 2.0, headphone jack, microphone port (front) Size: 190mm x 495mm x 432mm (W x D x H) Nvidia's bruising GTX 1070 is the headline act here, so it's unsurprising that StormForce has had to hand-pick other components to keep the cost below £1,000/US$1,315/AUS$1,709. Manufactured on the 14-nanometer process, Intel's Core i5-6400 sits slap bang in the middle of the company's range of mainstream processors, and its maximum clock speed of 3.3GHz is more than sufficient for gaming. There's enough space inside for further expansion. Free slots include one PCI-e x 16 slot, three PCI-e, two standard PCI slots and five internal bays. Additionally, two free 5.25-inch internal bays present the option to install multiple SSDs, while two free external bays mean you can add anything from a Blu-Ray drive to a fan controller. Benchmarks Here's how the StormForce Tornado performed in our suite of benchmark tests: 3DMark: Cloud Gate: 48,801; Sky Diver: 48,296; Fire Strike: 17,950 Cinebench CPU: 516 points; Graphics: 162 fps Geekbench: 3,555 (single-core); 10,849 (multi-core) PCMark 8 Home: 4,825 points GTA V: (1080p, Ultra): 70 fps; (1080p, Low): 218 fps The Division: (1080p, Ultra): 78 fps; (1080p, Low): 187 fps Other 1070-equipped systems are currently thin on the ground, but the power over Nvidia's previous-generation card is clear when comparing it the Lenovo Ideacentre Y900 with a GTX 970 that we reviewed earlier this year. And, that system costs a full £100 (around $130 or AUS$170) more. Where Lenovo's machine struggled to hit 60 fps on the games we tested on Ultra settings at 1080p, the StormForce Tornado managed it each and every time, surpassing it in titles such as GTA V, The Division and Doom (2016). In The Division, the 1070 managed an average of 61 fps with the resolution set to 1440p; switching over to Doom, it reached an average of 46 fps at 4K. The gap between the two systems is also shown up in PCMark's Fire Strike benchmark. The Tornado almost doubled the Y900's score of 9,629, achieving 17,950 points. Despite its power, StormForce's machine runs quietly under full load with the fans only kicking in during visually intensive scenarios. Nvidia GTX 1080 versus GTX 1070 The Tornado loses marks when it comes to storage - at least in terms of speed. The 1TB SATA drive inside might take you a while to fill, but it renders longer boot and app loading times than what you would get with an SSD. Plus, Steam games take a noticeably longer time to install than we're used to with this drive. Final verdict It's currently difficult to go far wrong with one of Nvidia's Pascal cards right now. However, StormForce has successfully complemented the StormForce Tornado's GTX 1070 inside with an attractive case that's easily accessible and comes with plenty of ports, external drive bays and internal expansion options. It has the muscle to run pretty much any game comfortably at 1080p with each setting maxed out, and you'll get decent performance at 1440p, too. Gaming at 4K resolution will require you to turn the settings down a notch or two if you want to hit those fluid frame rates, which is a fair trade off in our eyes. The StormForce Tornado is only let down by its persistent blue lightning on the front of the case and the lack of an SSD - but at least there's plenty of room inside the case to add your own.

   Mobileye and Delphi Commit To More-Affordable Self-Driving Car System by Jon LeSage August 23, 2016 Tweet Email Print Go Back Print this page Photo Gallery Sorry there are no photos! Hide Mobileye and Delphi Automotive are working together to launch a more-affordable technology for self-driving cars that the two companies say will be available by the end of the decade. Their technology will rely less on costly Lidar sensors, which are being used in most of the autonomous vehicle test projects, according to a Bloomberg report. Finding an alternative, cost-effective technology will make available self-driving car systems to carmakers that might lack funding for autonomous systems, said Amnon Shashua, chairman and chief technology officer of Israel-based Mobileye. The companies are spending “hundreds of millions of dollars” to develop the system, said Kevin Clark, chief executive officer of U.K.-based Delphi. It will be ready to sell by 2016, he said. “Together, we’re planning to build a new class of machine intelligence capable of mimicking true human driving capabilities,” Amnon Shashua, chairman and chief technology officer of Mobileye, said in a conference call on Tuesday. “Our alliance provides a solution with a much smaller investment to our customers” to deploy fully autonomous cars. SEE ALSO: BMW Reportedly Partnering with Mobileye and Intel on Self-Driving Technology Mobileye, a collision software detection maker, joined up with BMW and Intel in June for a development partnership to produce autonomous vehicle technology. The team has committed to rolling out a self-driving car by 2021. Delphi Automotive has become known in recent years in the auto industry for testing out its own self-driving systems, through the Delphi Drive project. Several other strategic alliances have been announced in recent months, which signifies the advancement of the technology and pressure to be competitive in the new field. Uber Technologies Inc. last week announced a $300 million development deal with Volvo AB. During that time, Ford made a pledge to launch a self-driving car for ride-hailing by 2021. The automaker has jointly invested in tech supplier Velodyne Lidar Inc. with China’s Baidu Inc. Google, which has played a leading role in testing the technology, announced a partnership with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in May to test out 100 self-driving Chryler Pacifica plug-in hybrid minivans. Clark said Delphi and Mobileye will demonstrate their new system early next year at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Road testing will begin in Singapore soon after the first of the year, he said. The system will draw on the two companies’ existing technology, which is “camera and radar-centric,” Shashua said. Using their new system eliminates the need for the “redundant sensor,” he said, referring to Lidar.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search PlayStation Now PC launch confirmed, DualShock USB adapter revealed Eric Abent - Aug 23, 2016 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Earlier in the month, we heard that Sony might be plotting to bring its PlayStation Now service over to Windows. As it turns out, those rumors were true, with Sony confirming the jump to Windows PCs today. The company also revealed a new PS4 DualShock adapter, which will allow players to cut out the USB cord and use their controllers wirelessly with their PCs. There’s no word yet on when PlayStation Now will launch on PC, but Sony says it’ll come to Europe first and then to North America shortly thereafter. For those unacquainted with PlayStation Now, the premise is rather simple, as it allows users to pay a monthly fee of $19.99 (or a quarterly fee of $49.99) to stream PS3 games to their current-gen consoles. Have a look at the recommended PC specs for running PS Now: – Windows 7 (SP1), 8.1 or 10 – 3.5 GHz Intel Core i3 or 3.8 GHz AMD A10 or faster – 300 MB or more; 2 GB or more of RAM – Sound card; USB port At the moment, this is the only way to play PS3 games on anything other than the console they were made for, as the PlayStation 4 doesn’t offer any kind of backwards compatibility. Moving PlayStation Now to Windows will give PC players the opportunity to check out more than 400 PS3 titles, though $20 a month is nothing to stick your nose up at, especially considering that $20 can net you quite a few games depending on when you happen to be browsing PC storefronts like Steam and GOG. Still, for those who missed out on the previous console generation entirely, this will offer a chance to go back and play through some PS3 exclusives for the first time, and that might be worth the subscription cost for a few months at least. As for that DualShock adapter, it’ll be available for $24.99 sometime early next month. It’ll be compatible with both Windows and Mac, and can be used with any PC game that supports PS4 controllers.

Medivation Inc. (MDVN) to Be Acquired by Pfizer for $14B Articles > Market Commentary > Another Multi-Billion Dollar Opportunity for NVIDIA Another Multi-Billion Dollar Opportunity for NVIDIA NVIDIA (NVDA) is aggressively focusing on the deep learning market, as it is projected to grow over $100 billion in yearly revenue by 2024. The company stated that deep learning plays a very significant role in changing computing. At present stage, NVIDIA’s GPUs are used by many companies to create their own machine learning computers. For instance, social media giant, Facebook (FB), uses the company’s Tesla M40 GPUs for its Big Sur machine learning computers. This is a huge growth opportunity for NVIDIA and given its track record of being successful in several markets, I think the company will benefit from it. Moreover, the company has already begun marketing some of its GPUs, such as Tesla P100, mainly to the enterprise market for corporate data centres. As a matter of fact, this is likely to surge because server and cloud-computing tasks are becoming complex day by day. In the case of severe data processing, NVIDIA’s DGX-1 deep learning supercomputer is the most efficient and reliable, as it is approximately five times faster compared to Intel’s Xeon Phi. Apart from this, the company picked TSMC’s 16 nanometer FinFET Plus manufacturing technology to manufacture all of its Pascal architecture based graphics processors, which should include the company’s gaming business over the imminent numerous quarters. Image by janeb13 / Pixabay Furthermore, the company also knocked TSMC’s gate for its next generation Tegra SoC, a major component of its trivial but gradually escalating automotive chip business. However, according to a South Korean newspaper, NVIDIA will tap Samsung to create graphics processors grounded on Pascal architecture before the end of this year. The company does not bring huge volume of chips, but it is still a significant user of TSMC’s superior manufacturing technologies. TSMC’s technology is based on 16 nm, and NVIDIA is focusing on the 14 nm manufacturing process. At present, Samsung and Intel are only two firms that have 14 nm manufacturing process. This clearly suggests it is highly likely that the company’s two upcoming graphics processors could either be built entirely at Samsung or with the help of Samsung as well as TSMC. Conclusion The primary reason why I have always liked NVIDIA is because the company has a diversified revenue stream. The company is successfully gaining traction in several high growth markets and the aforementioned opportunity further boosts its growth prospects. Although the stock is trading at a high valuation, I think investors can still add NVIDIA to their portfolios. Published on Aug 23, 2016 By Prudent Investor Copyrighted 2016.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Nvidia's Drive PX 2 computer for autonomous vehicles has a new Tegra chip codenamed Parker. Credit: Nvidia More like this Nvidia to detail its next-gen Tegra mobile chip in August Nvidia's updated Drive PX 2 computer will drive autonomous cars From cars to supercomputers: Nvidia moves ahead with new chips Video Mingis on Tech: Google rolls out the hardware Buying an autonomous car may be in your future, but make sure it has a capable processor installed so the vehicle doesn't get in trouble with traffic police. Autonomous cars could make timely and more accurate decisions with Nvidia's new Tegra chip code-named Parker. The chip has the computing power to allow autonomous cars to recognize a wide range of signs, objects, signals and lanes. Parker can also deliver 4K video to in-car entertainment systems. Details of the chip were presented for the first time at the Hot Chips conference this week in Cupertino, California. The Parker chip is to vehicles what Intel's Core chip is to PCs. It delivers a lot of computing horsepower to autonomous vehicles, considered a new form of "mobile" computing by chip makers. The announcement also raises questions about whether Nvidia will put Tegra chips in mobile devices and board computers like the Jetson. In a blog entry, Nvidia called Parker a "mobile processor that will power the next generation of autonomous vehicles." Parker, like its predecessor Tegra X1, is designed for low-power and battery operation, according to an Nvidia spokesman. The company didn't immediately share details on other uses for the chip. Nvidia has gotten out of the smartphone market, and the future of Tegra in tablets is in question. Last year's Tegra X1 was used in Google's Pixel C tablet, and Nvidia's outdated Shield Tablet uses the Tegra K1, the predecessor to X1. The Parker chip is already used in Nvidia's Drive PX 2, a computer that sits in car trunks. Drive PX 2 will be used by Volvo in road tests of its XC90 sports utility vehicle next year. Car companies and researchers are also developing autonomous cars with Drive PX 2, Nvidia said. Drive PX 2 does the heavy calculations so autonomous vehicles can do their job, but the computer also needs to consult cloud computing services for training and object recognition. The computer supports deep-learning models from companies like Google, Baidu, Microsoft and Facebook. The Parker chip has been optimized to process data related to a variety of deep-learning models. Parker has four 64-bit Cortex-A57 cores based on the ARM architecture, and two homegrown Denver 2.0 CPU cores. It has security layers to prevent the chip from being hacked, according to slides presented at Hot Chips. Nvidia says Parker outperforms other chips, a claim other ARM-based chipmakers like Qualcomm and Apple may contest. However, its CPUs are quickly going out of fashion. The Cortex-A57 cores are being replaced by ARM's faster and more power-efficient Cortex-A72 cores in chips. Parker's GPU blows away the competition. It has a 256-core GPU based on the latest Pascal graphics architecture, and the performance is important for visual computing. Cameras capture images and then work with the GPU and algorithms to recognize objects, signs, and signals. The chip supports up to 12 cameras. The GPU supports hardware-based encode and decode for 4K video based on the H.265 and VP9 codecs. Nvidia claims it can support playback on three 4K displays at 60 frames per second. Gamers would rejoice if Nvidia decides to release a new Shield tablet with the Parker chip. Parker supports LPDDR4 video and is made using a 16-nanometer manufacturing process.

Published Thu, Aug 18, 2016  |  David Dittman, Editorial Director The technology revolution is a multidisciplinary phenomenon cutting across all dimensions of human experience. We’re talking about advances in biotechnology that will help us identify, understand, manipulate, improve, and control living organisms – including humans. New, “smart” materials, agile manufacturing, and nanotechnology are already changing the way we make devices and expanding their capabilities. Conversations like this will lead to cures for diseases like cancer, the eradication of malnutrition, elimination of pollution, extension of life expectancy, and improvement of quality of life. The continuing proliferation and increasing utility of information is the thread tying this revolution together and driving it forward. Since the first transistor was fabricated in 1947, we’ve witnessed a 1-million-time reduction in the size of what we now call computer chips. The state of the art is Intel Corp.’s (INTC) 22-nanometer, three-dimensional Tri-Gate transistor. Processing speed — or “time integration” — has improved by one million times. So today we’re going to talk about one discrete discipline that’s been left behind… but may soon start to catch up. Compared with what’s happening with information storage, energy storage is basically stuck in the 19th century. Since the lead-acid battery was invented in 1859 — in time to power Civil War telegraph communication between armies in the field and military and civilian leaders in Washington, D.C. — we’ve witnessed “energy integration” of about five times. The first lead-acid batteries provided about 40 watt-hours per kilogram. The latest lithium-ion batteries have improved to about 200. Due largely to its high power-to-weight ratio and its low cost, lead-acid remains the standard for powering things like car batteries, backup supplies in cellphone towers, generators for facilities such as hospitals, and stand-alone power systems. People are starting to pay attention, though, and this quiet corner of the technology revolution is about to get a lot noisier. Or disrupted, if you will. Battery buzz has been building because of portable power. Think of devices such as laptops, digital cameras, and smartphones. Now we’re onto electrified transportation, driven by Elon Musk’s Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) and the proliferation of airborne drones, based on major advances in the amount of energy we can integrate within a given weight or volume. The next frontier is the electric grid. The electric grid takes power from where it’s generated to where it’s used. It integrates generating stations that produce electricity, high-voltage transmission lines that carry it to demand centers, and distribution lines that connect to homes and businesses. It’s been called one of the greatest inventions in human history. And it’s also still rooted in 19th century technology. Let’s set aside for the moment issues such as its vulnerability to terrorists and hackers and the mass chaos that can result from disruption and talk about the integration of new storage technology into the grid. Storage will increase grid stability by reducing incidents such as brownouts and blackouts. And it will also solve the “intermittency” problem and enable the utility-scale use of solar and wind power. We can be more efficient and cleaner. Until very recently, options for the long-term storage of wind and solar power were thought to be limited. Chemical energy storage — converting output to hydrogen via electrolysis for future use in vehicles or fuel cells or to methane for use in the gas grid or for direct heat and power generation — was one option. Tesla’s Musk is a champion of compressed air energy storage (CAES). According to the Energy Storage Association, “In a CAES plant, ambient air is compressed and stored under pressure in an underground cavern. When electricity is required, the pressurized air is heated and expanded in an expansion turbine, driving a generator for power production.” CAES is basically a variation on the technology employed by pumped-hydro plants in terms of application, output, and capacity. Pumped hydro, the largest-capacity form of grid energy storage presently available, has been around since the 1890s. It stores energy that’s pumped from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation. Low-cost, off-peak electric power is used to run the pumps. The stored water is ultimately released through turbines to produce electric power. So what about batteries? Well, No. 2 on the World Economic Forum’s annual list of breakthrough technologies is next-generation batteries that will allow for grid-scale energy storage. Companies such as Altair Nanotechnologies Inc. (ALTI), A123 Systems, and Swiss firm Leclanché are doing fascinating work with lithium-ion technology. According to an Altair press release, “Going beyond lithium-ion, Altair’s lithium-titanate-based battery systems are among the highest-performing and most-scalable, with applications that include battery cells for military artillery, battery packs for hybrid vehicles and energy storage systems for large-scale stationary power services.” A123Systems’ website says its “proprietary nanoscale electrode technology is built on initial developments from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.” Established in 1909, Leclanché develops proprietary lithium-ion technologies and operates its own factory, producing lithium-ion titanate as well as graphite/nickel-manganese-cobalt cells. But the most exciting development for storage technology may be the product of one small Scottsdale, Arizona, startup Fluidic Energy. Fluidic’s proprietary zinc-air battery technology and integrated intelligence may be the battery technology innovation that checks the boxes: higher energy density, lower cost, better safety, and longer life. The company has raised more than $150 million in funding from venture capitalists and government sources, and now has the financial backing of Caterpillar Inc. (CAT). Fluidic, which owns more than 100 patents, now has more than 75,000 batteries in use around the world. According to the company’s website: Comparing lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries to Fluidic’s Zinc-Air Battery is like comparing sprinters to marathon runners. Both perform the same fundamental activity, yet each releases energy very differently, over different periods of time. Zinc-Air Batteries, like a marathon runner, exert a steady flow of energy over a longer period of time. They’re capable of storing large amounts of energy and discharging it nonstop for four, eight, 12, or over 72 hours. Spun out from research at Arizona State University, Fluidic is already providing mini-grid solutions to more than 400,000 residents in 100 remote villages and communities in rural Madagascar. And it recently signed a memorandum of understanding to deploy similar solutions in Indonesia. Today, it’s delivering electricity to 2.7 million people, with a stated goal of serving 100 million by 2025. In addition to its mini-grid systems, Fluidic’s batteries are also in high demand in the telecom industry to power cell towers. They also provide critical backup power for national security, military, first-responder, and emergency road and utility repair crews as well as hospitals. And the zinc-air technology is also grid-enabling, safe for use by commercial and residential customers who want to produce and store their own power. That’s some 21st century stuff right there. Money Quote The electric light has caused me the greatest amount of study and has required the most elaborate experiments… Although I was never myself discouraged or inclined to be hopeless of its success, I cannot say the same for all of my associates… And yet through all of the years of experimenting and research, I never once made a discovery. All my work was deductive… The results I achieved were those of invention — pure and simple. I would construct a theory and work on its lines until I found it untenable. Then it would be discarded at once and another theory evolved. This was the only possible way for me to work out the problem. — Thomas Edison, paraphrased from Edison — The Man and His Work by George S.

Presidential Election: Who Benefits Most From the “Establishment’s” Status Quo? Does Donald Trump Really Hate Science? Comments (1) Ike Kiefer says: August 22, 2016 at 2:37 pm Batteries were not forgotten by science and innovation. Electricity storage has long been the holy grail of electricity technology and a huge focus of effort and spending. Shrinking electricity is just a much more stubborn problem than shrinking computing power because one is dealing with physical particles and tangible quantities of energy and mass rather than merely manipulating intangible bits of information that have no inherent size. Electricity in batteries or fuel cells or capacitors is stored in the orbital configuration of electrons within different compound molecules, and energy and power density are thus limited by the physics of the atom. With electricity storage, we began at the nano-scale. With bits we began with macroscopic pebbles and abacus beads. Even after all the progress to date in shrinking computer chips and data storage, a single bit is currently represented by more than a million atoms on a hard drive, so there is still much room to shrink them. The only way to stably store energy more densely than atomic electrons is in atomic nucleons, and that is the difference between chemical energy and nuclear energy. Is Wall Street anticipating an imminent nuclear energy storage breakthrough? Are investors ready to fund consumer nuclear energy storage for for homes and automobiles?

Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today Those who are waiting for the release of a MacBook Air 2016 edition might be a little disappointed. This is after rumors claimed that Apple Inc. is not planning to come out with one anytime soon. According to reports, the tech firm is currently focused on working on a new MacBook Pro 2016, which makes it a challenge for them to come out with a new version of the MacBook Air. The speculations about the delay of MacBook Air 2016 is backed by the lack of any major upgrade in the MacBook Air product line during the last few years. The Cupertino-based tech giant only offered several minor improvements on their lightest and slimmest laptop since its launch in 2008. In spring 2015, Apple released several under-the-hood improvements on the MacBook Air. They include the addition of the Intel Broadwell chipset, the Thunderbolt 2 display, as well as the high-definition graphics 6000. Other rumors claimed that Apple Inc. is considering to scrap the MacBook Air product line completely, since a number of industry insiders believed that the ultraportable laptop is actually redundant. On the other hand, those who are planning to purchase a new laptop soon could consider getting the new MacBook Pro. It will reportedly come out with a better graphics card that is ideal for gaming, as well as a better display screen. The rumored new MacBook Pro is also expected to feature Intel Kaby Lake, the Thunderbolt 3 port, an ITB SSD and the USB-C port. It will also be lighter and slimmer compared to the current MacBook Pro as well as the MacBook Air. It could also come out with Apple's latest operating system called the Mac OS Sierra which will feature the introduction of Siri on laptop devices. Apple Inc. is expected to unveil its latest products in the company's major event on Sept. 7.

Resend activation e-mail Cars Technica / All things automotive Delphi, Mobileye unite to bring easy-to-integrate autonomy to car makers Demo car will be displayed at CES this year, production-grade systems ready in 2019. by Megan Geuss - Aug 23, 2016 2:37 pm UTC Login to bookmark Last year, Delphi demoed a self-driving car that drove across the country autonomously. Megan Geuss Today, auto parts supplier Delphi and sensor-maker Mobileye announced a plan to build a fully autonomous car system that auto manufacturers can use to make their cars self-driving without investing a lot of expensive R&D. The companies say the system will be production-ready for OEMs by 2019. On a conference call with Delphi CEO Kevin Clark and Mobileye CTO Amnon Shashua, the two executives estimated that car-buyers would likely see such a system in new cars between late 2019 and 2021. Delphi has been working on building self-driving software for years now—Ars went down to its Silicon Valley garage last spring to see an Audi that Delphi had tricked out with its own autonomous system prior to embarking on a self-driving cross-country road trip. Mobileye, too, has a lot of experience—most recently it announced a partnership with BMW and Intel to build self-driving BMW platforms. It also had a falling out with Tesla earlier this year after a driver was killed when his car struck a left-turning truck while the Tesla was in autonomous mode. Most semi-autonomous systems that you currently find in high-end Audis, Volvos, and Mercedes-Benzes already rely on some combination of software and hardware from third-party auto parts makers like Delphi, Mobileye, or Bosch. The Delphi and Mobileye partnership is not especially novel either, as the two companies have worked together on various projects since 2002. What is new is that the companies said that their new partnership will result in “turn-key” Level 4 and Level 5 systems—or “high” and “full” autonomous systems according to the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)—that can be easily integrated into vehicles of all shapes and sizes. Level 5 automation is the highest level described by the SAE. Still, Clark said that all cars outfitted with a Delphi/Mobileye system will still have steering wheels and pedals so that users can take over if they wish. “Regulators want fewer injuries and fatalities,” Clark said on the press call today, “commuters want less traffic.” A partnership between the two companies, the CEO stressed, would help realize those demands more quickly. A press release from Delphi noted that Mobileye will be contributing its work on the EyeQ 4/5 SoC to process sensor signals and map surroundings. Delphi will be contributing intellectual property pertaining to predictive algorithms as well as Delphi’s suite of software for camera, radar, and lidar information. “In addition, teams from both companies will develop the next generation of sensor fusion technology as well as the next generation human-like ‘driving policy,’” the press release added. On the call, the executives would not elaborate on how much the two companies are investing in this effort, but Clark said it’s in the “hundreds of millions of dollars” range. Shashua said that the partnership on this effort “goes beyond simply combining components” and involves building a system than can not only drive autonomously but is also able to do things like “merge into traffic in a way that mimics human behavior.” The Mobileye executive also deflected questions about Mobile’s recent partnership with BMW and Intel to build a fully autonomous BMW platform called the iNext by 2021. “This partnership is a partnership between suppliers,” Shashua said. “Whatever we do with Delphi would definitely help any other partnership we have. “A project of this scale requires as much innovation as possible… it reduces risk and allows us to accelerate this partnership,” Shashua added. “It does not contradict a partnership between supplier and car manufacturers.” Clark stepped in to add that many car makers may choose to develop autonomous systems independently if they “for whatever reason don’t want a turnkey approach.” The two executives stressed that their combined experience in autonomy gives them “tremendous confidence” in the success of the partnership. The Wall Street Journal pointed out that both Delphi and Mobileye have seen slipping share value in the last 52 weeks due to car sales leveling off and auto manufacturers moving toward developing in-house components. This new product could help the two companies sell high-end systems that would reduce automakers’ investment costs and their risk profiles. As of this morning, Delphi and Mobileye shares are up three percent and seven percent, respectively. Expand full story Reader comments You must login or create an account to comment.

Irritable Cisco kicks Nutanix out of partner program SimpliVity has announced an all-flash hyper-converged system and upped its single system VDI count from 2,000 to 4,000. It has also introduced RapidDR virtualised workload recovery and app-aware SQL Server backups. The CN-5400-F forms the high-end of SimpliVity's otherwise hybrid flash/disk product range: CN-1400 - 3-6TB effective capacity* for SME customers, CN-2400 - 5 - 12TB capavity for mid-range, CN-3400 - 18 - 36TB capacity for mid-range, CN-5400 - 20-40TB capacity for high-end, CN-5400-F - 20-40TB all-flash capacity for high-end. SimpliVity says the CN-5400-F, which uses 14 x 1.6TB Intel DC S3610 SATA 6Gbit/s SSDs, can reduce latency by 50-80 per cent for tier-1 applications such as online transaction processing (OLTP). The system can increase application performance by up to 5X, and can also speed Big Data analytics. The CN-5400-F is also claimed to deliver the lowest price per fully-protected VM. SimpliVity has also doubled the number of desktops supported by a single building block of SimpliVity systems from 2,000 to 4,000. It says this is validated by LoginVSI as more than 2x greater than alternative hyper-converged solutions. The 4,000 desktop building block is based on SimpliVity’s hybrid CN-2400 OmniCube model. The increase in desktop density comes from software improvements in the latest OmniStack version (3.5.2) and also from increasing the scale of the building block in terms of the number of nodes. The numbers are impressive: 1,000 logins in 1,000 seconds and 1,000 desktops provisioned in 70 minutes. There is built-in data protection, high availability, and site-to-site disaster recovery. Customers can choose Lenovo or Cisco hardware platforms, including the all-flash version, for SimpliVity's product range instead of its own OmniCube hardware. RapidDR automates the recovery of virtualised workloads via a pre-configured plan, providing a 70 per cent improvement in RTO compared to following a manual playbook. It's called a one-click facility and has, SimpliVity claims, an intuitive, VM-centric, 5-step GUI. SimpliVity Omnicubes Application-aware SQL Server backups offer built-in data protection at no additional cost, eliminating the cost and complexity, SimpliVity says of third-party backup and replication products. Some 83 per cent of SimpliVity customers run SQL Server, and they can automate SQL Server backup and recovery, improve recovery point objectives and automate the recovery process. SimpliVity's producy strategy VP Jesse St Laurent says the company has a "consistently high Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 90," meaning its customers really do like the products and company. All of these new products and features will become available in the fourth quarter. ® * SimpliVity says its effective capacity numbers are a conservative range based on compression and deduplication rates found in standard, primary storage use cases.

Raspberry Pi VC4 Gallium3D Makes More Progress With NIR, Camera DMA-BUF Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 23 August 2016 at 08:54 AM EDT. 7 Comments Broadcom's Eric Anholt has written another weekly blog post covering improvements he made over the past week to the VC4 open-source graphics driver that's known as being the driver for Raspberry Pi devices. Exciting from last week's work is that he was able to work again on making use of the NIR intermediate representation in the VC4 Gallium3D driver, following Intel leading the charge on NIR in Mesa and Freedreno's interest in NIR too. He commented that now he's made TGSI (Gallium3D's default IR) go away from normal GLSL paths, "I also spent a little bit of time last week finishing off the series to use st/nir in vc4. I managed to get to no regressions, and landed it today. It doesn't eliminate TGSI, but it does mean TGSI is gone from the normal GLSL path." He's also made progress on camera integration via DMA-BUF, testing, and more.
