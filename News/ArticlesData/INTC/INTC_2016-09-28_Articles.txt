Sponsored by the Automation Network Dresden (AND), the conference featured speakers from Boeing Spectrolab, SolarWorld, Texas Instruments, Intel, Cimetrix, Meyer Burger and Agilion GmbH, among others. The conference touched on a broad range of timely topics. Speakers from Texas Instruments and Fabmatics GmbH discussed successful automation efforts both in mature 200mm fabs and with automation-averse tools. Intel discussed their efforts to drive increased diversity among their manufacturing suppliers and how their RealSense hardware and depth-perception software can be leveraged into automation workflows. Efforts to drive big data analytics and IoT to the factory floor were presented by both Dresden University of Technology and Agilion GmbH. Other topics included the role of equipment data models in semiconductor production systems, SAP process automation in the manufacturing environment, and overviews from industry experts about the latest trends and the future of photovoltaic and IC manufacturing. Every year at the evening event, the Automation Network Dresden awards the "Innovation Award for Automation" to a leader in manufacturing automation. This year the award was presented to SolarWorld for their cutting-edge migration of a high-volume manufacturing execution system (MES) to a cloud platform. Travis Stevens, president of SYSTEMA USA Corporation, described this year's event as "Successful the feedback was positive. I know of no other event in the US that is specifically dedicated to bringing manufacturing experts together to discuss the latest innovations in the semiconductor automation solution space. We look forward to bringing this unique opportunity to the US again in the future." The Automation Network Dresden is a consortium of four Dresden-based companies AIS Automation Dresden GmbH, Fabmatics GmbH (formerly HAP GmbH and Roth Rau Ortner GmbH), SYSTEMA GmbH and XENON GmbH all of which are premier experts in automation through software and hardware.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 29, 2016 at 5:19PM Image source: Intel.  The year 2012 wasn't great for microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The company, which at the time derived 64% of its revenue from the sale of chips that go into personal computers, was blindsided as sales of personal computers unexpectedly began to slump. The cause of this deterioration was widely believed to be due to potential personal computer customers opting instead to purchase tablets like Apple's iPad.  The significant shortfall in demand for Intel's chips led the chip-maker to incur what are called "excess capacity charges" as it cut production of PC chips. Indeed, according to Intel's then-Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith, factory utilization during the company's fourth quarter 2012 earnings call were "below 50%." Remember, it costs billions of dollars to build these chip factories. The costs of these factories shows up in the income statement as depreciation, which adds to a company's cost-of-goods sold. The more revenue that a company can pump out of a factory in a given quarter, the higher the company's gross margins should be as those fixed depreciation costs are spread across a greater number of units.  So, when a company's factories are sitting there half-idle, the company is still bearing the full brunt of those depreciation charges while bringing in much lower revenue. Obviously, excess capacity isn't good. To this day, there are still some investors who believe that Intel's chip manufacturing facilities are substantially under-utilized and that the company needs to succeed in new growth markets in order to fill those factories. That's just not true. Some background Capacity planning for a given manufacturing technology is something that is done well in advance of the start of production. Indeed, on Intel's January 2013 earnings call, Smith told investors that the money that the company would be spending on capital equipment throughout 2013 would be in support of "the peak of 14-nanometer" unit demand as well as the "start of the ramp of the 10 [nanometer technology]." This means that it's up to management to try to make their best guesses today as to what kind of unit demand it will see at least a year out. Forecasting these things correctly is tough, especially when the majority of a company's unit demand is expected to come from highly volatile market segments. To make things even harder, there can be very severe consequences to either substantially under-shooting or over-shooting demand expectations. Over-shooting (at least by too much -- Intel has indicated in the past that it intentionally builds some extra capacity, which Smith referred to as "white space," in order to handle potentially better-than-expected demand) means unproductive (and thus costly) capacity.  This hurts margins and ultimately eats into profits.  Under-shooting means that the company won't be able to satisfy all of the demand for its products, which means revenue (and profits) left on the table.  With that in mind, we're now in a good position to understand why the "excess capacity myth" is just that -- a myth. Intel has brought down capacity substantially In the table below, I show Intel's capital expenditures from 2012 through 2015 as well as its projected capital expenditures in 2016 for logic products (Intel says it will be spending about $1.5 billion on non-volatile memory related production capacity, so I've excluded this): Year Logic capital expenditures (in $billions) 2012 11 2013 10.7 2014 10.1 2015 7.3 2016 8 Data source: Intel. Notice that there has been a clear trend downward in the company's capital spending over the last several years. This reduction in spending reflects the reality that Intel is selling far fewer personal computer processors today than it used to, so it doesn't need to build out as much capacity. Further, if we take a look at the following slide from Intel's 2015 investor meeting, we see that the reductions in overall capital spending actually mask the true reduction in logic capacity related spending: Image source: Intel. Intel's capacity related spending dropped sharply in 2013 relative to 2012 (when it became clear that tablets were eating into the personal computer market) and stayed about flat in 2014. Intel then reported a large drop in capacity spending in 2015 and is expecting to see a modest increase in 2016. The trend, however, is clear: spending on capacity has come down quite a bit over the last several years. This reduction in capacity-related spending is indicative of Intel right-sizing the amount of capacity it puts in to make sure that it can keep its factories at reasonably high utilization rates. And, given that the company's gross profit margins over the last couple of years have been quite high (higher utilization usually means better margins, lower utilization hurts margins), it's quite unlikely that Intel has substantial amounts of capacity sitting there idle.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

How to bring the data together and provide users with a unified view becomes significantly important. Data integration helps address the need and is nothing new. Early architectures for integrating data from heterogeneous databases include Integrated Public Use Microdata Series designed by University of Minnesota (IPUMS), mediated schema, semantic integration, and more. With big data growing rapidly and traditional systems unable to keep up, organizations started adopting data lake solutions like Apache Hadoop for data integration. A Data Lake helps create one repository for data in an organization, including structured data, semi-structured data, unstructured data, and binary data. The organization then expands its data lake with data processing and analytics capabilities to derive business insight. As data lakes are adopted, a new problem surfaces: the organization has existing systems which have been used for insight and decision making, so how can it bring these insights together? A data hub tries to address this problem by delivering a unified platform that can bring diverse data sources together and enable users to gain insight from a collection of frameworks for data processing, interactive analytics, and real time processing. Getting the Right Information: Data Governance Effective use of data integration for decision-making relies on more than having the best data lake or data hub architecture. For transportation, finance services, manufacturing, or other verticals, data comes from real-time and continuous feeding; the data is naturally messy. It is challenging for organizations to identify the “relevant” and “trustworthy” information. It requires continuous governance of the data coming in. The data needs to be well understood; noise and abnormality need to be removed; and the data needs to become meaningful to the problem being analyzed. Enterprise-grade data governance helps address several aspects: auditability, metadata and taxonomy management and data lifecycle management. Auditability ensures consistent ways to track data access, data origin and data usage. Metadata provides description of other data, e.g. attributes that define or describe a document. Taxonomy categorizes the data into hierarchical relationship. Successful metadata and taxonomy management ensure data is managed in a consistent way in the data lake/hub and provide a meaningful context for understanding their values. Data lifecycle management tracks the data from ingestion, storage, recovery and backup to retirement, ensures data is of high quality and is accessible to relevant users.   A Data Lake helps create one repository for data in an organization, including structured data, semi-structured data, unstructured data, and binary data   Generating Real Time Insight: Streaming Technologies Great data means nothing if it does not deliver the needed business insight. Data analytics have been broadly used by organizations to gain insight for improving efficiency, outperforming competitions, and creating growth opportunities. However, with fast growth of IOT and connected devices, organizations are no longer satisfied with back-end analytics itself. There is a clear trend to have end-to-end real time analytics, which instantly brings information from sources together with decisions. Financial services, healthcare, transportation and other sectors are accelerating investment in streaming analytics from client to cloud and the data center. Apache Spark, Apache Flink, and Apache Storm* are open source examples supporting streaming analytics.  Streaming analytics allows continuous ingestion of live streaming data from IOT or other connected devices, provides faster insights, and performs actions promptly before the data loses its value. For example, the financial industry with its wide range of products, services, and customer interaction channels, have seen fraud risks increase tremendously. Financial institutions are turning to streaming technologies for exploiting and analyzing huge volume of data instantly in order to identify and stop fraudulent behavior. Streaming analytics also opens the opportunity for healthcare providers to constantly monitor the health situation of patients, diagnose and detect disease at the earliest signs as well as bring prompt and personalized treatment. Companies like Intel have been working with healthcare providers on collaborative cancer cloud and genomics analytics. Making the Insight Adaptive: Webscale Artificial Intelligence Big data analytics needs to analyze large collections of data, extract complex data representations, and inference patterns in order to generate the insight. As the data volume, variety, velocity, and veracity grow exponentially, it is becoming more complicated to discover the patterns. Artificial Intelligence (AI), thanks to its abilities inspired by biological processes for hierarchical learning and layered data abstraction, helps address these problems. AI has been in place for decades, yet has not gained significant momentum until recent years due to inadequate compute power and inadequate data volume. Training performance has been a conventional area for improving AI. However, the bigger challenge for AI in big data analytics is to improve its scalability, e.g. its data scalability, model scalability, and node scalability.  When organizations apply AI to big data infrastructure, it’s found that the need to resolve the scalability is more urgent than improving the training performance. There have been some good attempts in improving the scalability. A few years ago, Google developed a software framework, DistBelief, to train a deep learning model with billions of parameters using tens of thousands of CPU cores for speech recognition and computer vision. In addition to model and compute scalability, DistBelief also supported data parallelism. In recent years, Intel reported its collaboration with customers to improve modeling and data scalability thru Apache Spark, resulting in machine learning capability running on 100s or even 1000s of CPU servers, with tens of billions of unique features, and/or billions of edge graphs.  Another need from these organizations is an end to end pipeline for AI, from data ingestion, data management, feature management, feature engineering, to model training and validation, for simplifying AI implementation on big data infrastructure. Summary Ninety percent of the data in the world today was generated in past few years. The power of big data is that it can process large and complex data sets very fast and generate better insight than conventional methods. Having an effective analytics solution for insight takes well-designed data integration, data governance, streaming, AI, and holistically optimized solution stack. Although Data analytics has not reached maturity, thanks to fast technology advancement, real-time and meaningful insight it has become possible to make efficient business decisions that improve our lives.  Read Also Now that we can connect everything, should we?

CoinDesk "The closest you’ll probably come to a secure hardware solution is something like ORWL, which is guaranteed to 'self destruct' if anyone attempts to tamper with it." We all have precious information, and we all need to store it somewhere. What happens when you’re not around your computer? For system administrators, physicians, lawyers, and journalists, protecting information is critically important. Sometimes it is even a life or death matter. And yet, when it comes to the computing hardware we all use everyday, most of us don’t even take the simple precautions that we use to protect our money. ORWL was created to bridge this gap and bring hardened physical security to personal computing. Features & Specifications Processor: Intel Skylake M3 (without vPro) or M7 (with vPro) Graphics: Integrated Intel 515 chipset supports 4K output Ports: 2X USB 3.0 Type C, 1X micro HDMI Power: External power adapter connects to either USB 3.0 port Memory: 8 GB Storage: 120 or 480 GB SSD with automatic AES 256-bit encryption Connectivity: Bluetooth 4.1, Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac Operating Systems: Ubuntu and other GNU/Linux systems, Windows 10 Secure Microcontroller: MAX32550 DeepCover Secure Cortex-M3 with projected 6-month unplugged battery life Authentication: NFC + BLE key fob and user password Dimensions: 130 mm diameter, 30 mm height, 400 g weight Datasheet: PDF (3.79 MB) Physically Secure Among information security professionals, it’s a truism that once somebody has physical access to your computer, it’s game over. Software exploits to steal data take a lot of time, money, and/or skill to pull off, and are only fleetingly effective before the vulnerability is patched. On the other hand, there are many fast, cheap, and easy ways to steal data once an adversary has physical access to your computer. The internals of a desktop or laptop computer are easily accessed and tapped for information, not to mention the myriad ways computer peripherals can hide malicious eavesdropping devices or otherwise be corrupted to work against you. This is where ORWL comes in. ORWL was designed specifically to prevent undetected tampering with any of its electrical components, including the entire motherboard and storage drive. When tampering is detected, ORWL immediately and irrevocably erases all your data, even if it is unplugged at the time. Secure Microcontroller A battery-backed secure microcontroller (MAX32550 DeepCover Secure Cortex-M3) is integrated into the motherboard. It verifies the integrity of all firmware prior to boot, controls the power to rest of the Intel platform that runs the operating system, interfaces directly to an OLED display and NFC and BLE gateway for communicating with the secure key fob, and constantly monitors a dedicated inertial measurement unit, the active mesh (see below), the internal temperature, and input power voltage for any tampering. The battery itself is projected to last about six months without being connected to power. This chip was chosen because it is powerful (108 MHz Cortex M3) and offers the highest level of security, with features that you simply cannot reproduce with general purpose microcontrollers. These features include: side channel scan protection, flip-flop based key storage, encrypted SNVRAM, glitching protection, crypto acceleration, die shield with dynamic fault detection, temperature monitoring, integrated real-time clock, true random number generation, and dedicated tamper-sensor mesh monitoring. Encrypted Drive ORWL’s solid state drive, an Intel SSD 540s Series, natively supports full drive encryption. The drive’s cryptographic key is generated and stored inside the secure microcontroller. The secure microcontroller provides this key to the SSD only after verifying the integrity of the system. Upon any tampering, the secure microcontroller instantly erases the encryption key, causing all data on the SSD to be irrevocably lost. Enveloping Active Mesh The entire ORWL system is encased in an active clamshell mesh formed by laser direct structuring (LDS), a technique for creating a resin material with finely printed circuitry designed to shatter when drilled. This mesh prevents access to any hardware component. LDS is a tamper-proofing technology used for many high security applications in banking, aerospace, defense – including hardware security modules (HSMs), security tokens, automated teller machines (ATMs), telecom crypto-key protection, defense electronics, and medical devices. Opening the clamshell will relieve pressure switches, which will cause the secure microcontroller to delete the SSD’s encryption key. The secure microcontroller constantly monitors the mesh by sending random data through it and measuring the impedance of each trace. Drilling or cutting the LDS clamshell breaks the continuity of the printed circuit, again resulting in the deletion of the encryption key. Shorting, bypassing, or otherwise changing the geometry of any of the traces will result in an impedance change, which similarly results in the deletion of the encryption key. The traces of the printed circuit are microns thick, have a nominal width of 0.3 mm, and a nominal spacing of 0.5 mm. You can always carefully open the clamshell yourself if you want to know what’s inside, but not without destroying the encryption key. After closing it, you will have to generate a new SSD encryption key and reinstall the entire system. Secure Key Fob Each ORWL comes with a key fob that uses the same authentication technology as smart-cards, with an added ability to detect proximity. After the initial pairing of the key fob with the ORWL to generate a shared secret, the key fob’s near field communication (NFC) is used to authenticate the user, at which point the key fob’s uses Bluetooth (BLE) to monitor whether or not the user is within range. Once a user goes out of range, ORWL will lock, requiring the key fob’s NFC authentication to unlock. The key fob is built around the STMicroelectronics ST54D a secure chipset conforming to ISO/IEC 14443 Type A running in card emulation mode. This controller handles NFC communication and includes several security features, such as a protected memory space and an on-die mesh that will trigger data erasure if tampered with. Within ORWL itself, a NXP CLRC663 chipset is used for NFC communciation and is controlled directly by the Maxim secure microcontroller. Communication between key fob and computer is encrypted and codes (including UUID) are synchronously updated on a regular basis. We will publish our source code for the NFC and BLE chipsets and provide support to develop custom solutions on them. OLED Display ORWL has an onboard OLED display for indicating its state: powered down, locked, and unlocked. The OLED display is entirely controlled by the secure microcontroller and is inaccessible from the operating system. More Information Much more detailed information about ORWL, its subsystems and components, and the design decisions that went into them can be found on our ever evolving wiki and in the ORWL product requirements document (PRD). Security Certification We are actively pursuing getting ORWL certified as a cryptographic module under a US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Federal Information Processing Standard known as FIPS 140-2. This is the standard under which the US government, financial institutions, health care providers, and other regulated industries store and process sensitive data. FIPS 140-2 Security Level 4 The FIPS 140-2 specification, defines four levels of certification, with level four being the most stringent: Security Level 4 provides the highest level of security defined in this standard. At this security level, the physical security mechanisms provide a complete envelope of protection around the cryptographic module with the intent of detecting and responding to all unauthorized attempts at physical access. Penetration of the cryptographic module enclosure from any direction has a very high probability of being detected, resulting in the immediate zeroization of all plaintext CSPs. Security Level 4 cryptographic modules are useful for operation in physically unprotected environments. Security Level 4 also protects a cryptographic module against a security compromise due to environmental conditions or fluctuations outside of the module’s normal operating ranges for voltage and temperature. Intentional excursions beyond the normal operating ranges may be used by an attacker to thwart a cryptographic module’s defenses. A cryptographic module is required to either include special environmental protection features designed to detect fluctuations and zeroize CSPs, or to undergo rigorous environmental failure testing to provide a reasonable assurance that the module will not be affected by fluctuations outside of the normal operating range in a manner that can compromise the security of the module. We are working toward and believe we have a very good chance of achieving FIPS 140-2 Security Level 4 certification, which would make ORWL the first personal computer to be so certified. Third-party Penetration Testing Complying with the certification requirements of FIPS 140-2 Security Level 4 is a complex, often lengthy process that takes highly specialized knowledge. To audit our work and guide us toward certification, we have engaged Penumbra Security, a NIST-accredited information security firm specializing in FIPS 140-2 compliance testing. Penumbra’s initial audit of ORWL has already resulted in several improvements to the design. We intend to continue working with Penumbra throughout the certification process. Open Source Security through obscurity is not security. We want the inner workings of ORWL to be transparent, so that it can receive the inspection necessary to build real trust. You shouldn’t need to take our word on how secure ORWL really is - you should be able to see for yourself. ORWL is a complex product, with many pieces that could possibly be open sourced. As such, we are still working through exactly which licenses will be used and how best to make available all the information. We will make updates on this page in the coming days. Here’s what we know and are committed to at this point: We will make available all source schematic and layout files, not just PDFs and Gerber files. We will make available all software under our control, including BIOS firmware, secure controller firmware, and key fob firmware. In order to maintain a competitive manufacturing advantage, some, but not all, of the source we make available will be released under a non-commercial license. For example, we will likely release the PCB layout source files under a non-commercial license, but the BIOS firmware will not have that restriction. For those sources not under our control, in particular the datasheet for the secure controller, we will work closely with our partners to make as much information available as possible. We are open to feedback! Please contact us with any comments, suggestions, or questions. Sign up for reminder emails above and watch this space for updates. We anticipate having all licenses sorted out very soon. Enclosures, Assembly, and Rack-mounting ORWL is available with a glass enclosure (as shown in most of the images on this page), a plastic enclosure that is roughly the same dimensions as the glass enclosure, and bare without any enclosure. ORWL with a plastic enclosure The glass enclosure is heat formed, then machined and polished. The glass is 2.8 mm thick and chemically hardened, so that it will not accidentally break when dropped: the target drop resilience is 0.6 meter onto marble. ORWL is designed to be easily (though carefully) disassembled and reassembled. Disassembling ORWL will erase the encryption key, rendering encrypted user data inaccessible. You will have to regenerate an SSD key and install a new operating system. That said, and because you should have backups of your data anyway, disassembly is possible provided you are careful. We cannot assume liability if you were to break the shield or any other part while disassembling. For ease of assembly, the screws are all identical: black, same length, with a Torx T8 head. Up to three bare ORWLs without any enclosures can be mounted to a specially made 1U rackmount chassis. ORWL’s key fob behavior can be configured to accommodate server use. ORWL rackmount chassis Limited Edition Aluminum Carrying Case As a small token of our appreciation for our early backers’ help getting ORWL off the ground, all ORWL units ordered during the campaign will include at no additional charge an aluminum carrying case with custom foam cutouts for securely and stylishly transporting ORWL and all its accessories. Dimensions: 12.5” x 5” x 9” Weight (fully loaded): 3.9 lbs Why Intel? Isn’t x86 Considered Harmful? This project is about having a standard, physically secure computer that anyone can use – as open as we can make it. All these concepts are important, and they mean that x86 and flawless out-of-the-box Windows support are not optional. There are reasons everyone is using x86, even in the security community and in governmental agencies around the world: compatibility, performance, and security. Make no mistake, some of us own Yeeloongs, and others are veterans of the silicon industry. We would love to ship a completely free and usable desktop processor, but we know very well that there is no alternative. Some people seem to think that switching to AMD can solve problems related Intel’s Management Engine (ME), microcode, or SMM. It doesn’t, as there are equivalents of these technologies in all recent x86 processors. Qubes OS Qubes OS is widely considered to be one of the most secure operating systems available. It relies on compartmentalizing the operating system into virtual machines so that, for example, an exploit in your browser doesn’t affect pieces outside your browser, such as your keyboard and mouse. ORWL meets all the minimum and recommended system requirements for running Qubes OS, including a processor that supports VT-x and VT-d. We offer Qubes OS as one of the pre-installed operating system options. Alternative BIOS We will not ship machines with Boot Guard “Verified Boot” activated. While we do implement a firmware verification mechanism on the microcontroller, you can choose to provision your own signing keys or not to use it at all. Firmware Verification, Reflashing, and Hacking ORWL is designed to be hackable. We will provide instructions on the ORWL wiki detailing how to perform various firmware verification, reflashing, and modification, as well as replacing parts such as the SSD. Of course, by design, opening ORWL results in all data being lost, thereby requiring a full system reinstallation. Specific Attacks and Mitigations The following are some of the specific attacks ORWL protects against. Cold Boot Attacks: Cold boot attacks consist of removing the DRAM or power-cycling the machine in order to read the memory content. The DRAM is often chilled to slow down the loss of information that occurs when the cells are no longer refreshed. Mitigations: The DRAM is soldered, and protected by the active clamshell mesh. Cooling down the secure microcontroller will trigger a tamper event, erasure of the encryption key, and system power down. Encryption keys are only stored in the main memory by the UEFI for an extremely short time before they are passed to the SED, and are securely memset’ed long before the OS is booted. When the machine is put in sleep mode while the user is away, the key is not stored in the main memory nor in the SED controller memory. To prevent other kinds of attacks on the memory content, the entire RAM is wiped before the OS is booted. UEFI etc. Attacks: UEFI BIOS, SMM attacks, and all sorts of platform vulnerabilities allow an attacker to run very privileged code that is both invisible to the OS and capable of achieving persistence by modifying the SPI flash. The UEFI image can also be modified by physical access to the component. Mitigations: We are in direct contact with the UEFI vendor and will work on patching public vulnerabilities. In the event that an attacker is able to exploit an SMM, UEFI, or platform vulnerability, there is no vector for persistence. The SPI flash Write Protection is controlled by the secure microcontroller, and the update process can be tied to a specific key fob or pin. The SPI flash content is also verified at every boot, before the Intel subsystem even receives power. Finally the external verification process allows you to easily read the flash and verify it. DMA Attacks: External DMA attacks over PCIe or Firewire can allow an attacker to read the memory content while the machine is running. Mitigations: We do not expose DMA-capable ports externally. For internal ports, the SED we selected is not PCIe capable. The Intel processor also supports VT-d, allowing you to block this class of attacks from software. Interdiction Attacks: The device is intercepted during shipping, modified, then forwarded to its destination. Mitigations: The system PIN will be shipped under separate cover, as is done with credit card or debit card PINs. If the device is opened for tampering prior to arrival, the root of trust (SSD encryption key) is deleted. Replacing this requires a paired key fob and the PIN. The result is that the owner will not be able to successfully boot the device if it’s been tampered with in this way. Because you have visibility into firmware, most software implants are very risky to use for your attackers. The hardware is protected by the shield, and the OLED screen that is the only exposed component is protected by a dedicated mesh. The screen’s flexible flat cable has a mesh on both sides, and is just as long as required. The space between the glass enclosure and the shield is also minimized. USB Fuzzing Attacks: A malicious USB device is inserted into an external USB port and used to find and exploit vulnerabilities in the USB host’s drivers. Mitigations: When the key fob is out of range (e.g., the user leaves the room with the key fob), ORWL goes into a lock down mode in which the data lines for all external USB ports are disconnected, which renders connected USB devices ineffective. Relay Attacks: An adversary steals an ORWL and replaces it with a replica, which then relays communication between the key fob and the original ORWL in order to unlock the original. Mitigations: ORWL employs time-of-flight analysis to detect relay attacks and rotating keys to foil them outright. Manufacturing Plan We’ve manufactured and tested several design and engineering iterations of ORWL prototypes. We are now ready for the first production run. If this campaign successfully reaches its funding goal, we will start production and wrap up what BIOS development remains to make ORWL feature complete. We (Design Shift) have years of experience in product design, engineering, and manufacturing, with full-time staff in both our Menlo Park and Taipei offices. Our manufacturing partner for ORWL is Taiwan-based Quanta Computer, one of the world’s largest computer manufacturers. We are also working directly with many of our suppliers, such as Intel, STMicroelectronics, and Maxim. Risks & Challenges Our team and partners have copious experience mitigating the supply chain risks inherent in manufacturing any nontrivial product and have taken the same care with ORWL. On our website, you can see some of the products we’ve previously designed and brought to market, such as the X1 Digital Camera, Clover point-of-sale system, and the Robin by Nextbit smartphone. The biggest risk in bringing ORWL to life is not whether it can be done, but how long it will take. We’ve laid out a conservative delivery schedule, but of course there may be surprises along the way that change that schedule. The biggest risk in this regard is the remaining BIOS development. While we have already made significant strides in the BIOS, there are some features that are not yet complete. In preparation for finishing the BIOS, we are currently in talks with a professional BIOS development team. Regardless of how the production schedule evolves over time, we commit to publicly and transparently communicating ORWL’s production status together with updated estimates of the delivery schedule.

Wait a couple of years for second-gen Small fry Scale offers single-node HCI boxen for the ROBO crowd Data management services have to get proactive – Acronis Comment Objective Analysis analyst Jim Handy has come up with a theory which he claims explains why Intel and Micron’s 3d XPoint memory will not meet its original performance claims. As Intel marketing droids have said, there is a difference between raw media access latency and SSD product access latency. Handy takes a (heh heh) handy SNIA chart graphically explaining this and modifies it to look at a PCIe MLC NAND SSD and a potential NVME XPoint SSD. In his report Handy approximates how the NAND SSD data read access time is taken up by six elements which the IO access has to traverse: Tread - time from the application processor putting out a memory address to the media chip returning valid data xfer - time to transfer data from chip to SSD output pins Misc - internal housekeeping; address translation; average garbage collection time Link Xfer - time to transfer data across PCIe interface Platform + adapter - time to travel from host’s IO port to processor pins Software - time for host’s operating system IO stack to perform read operation Here’s Handy’s chart: Our modified Jim Handy modification of SNIA SSD latency delay graphic. The horizontal axis shows access time in microseconds and we should firstly note that it is illustrative rather than accurate in a detailed timing sense. Take that on-board and look at the final three elements on the top SSD bar: link xfr, platform + adapter, and software. These elements are separate and independent from what happens on the SSD itself. The third point is that a change from NAND to XPoint media will affect the first three elements. A NAND-to-XPoint media shift may radically reduce these three items but won’t affect the other three, with the result that they contribute a proportionally larger part to the access latency. The chart compares NAND and XPoint PCIe SSDs. Handy makes the point that XPoint DIMMs will be much faster than XPoint SSDs, as indeed NAND DIMMs are faster than NAND SSDs. This will further reduce the Link XFer and Platform + adapter contributions to access latency, leaving the (larger) software contribution unaffected. Operating system and application software changes will be needed to sidestep the current OS IO stack and more direct access to the data presented by an XPoint DIMM, he claims. Such changes will also benefit NAND DIMMs, of course. Intel is also being criticised for seemingly over-stating XPoint’s endurance and density compared to NAND, and this explanation about why XPoint SSD latency is so slow doesn’t explain the differences between the original density and endurance claims and the newer ones now appearing. Intel said last week: "We stand by the performance figures we have shared publicly to date for both Intel Optane SSDs, pre-production and prototype versions, as well as 3D XPoint memory media. System level performance is determined by the full collection of components, with media being only one of these components. We are seeing great improvements over NAND-based SSDs – up to 10x throughput and 4x latency reductions – in prototype SSD hardware. Intel Optane technology-based SSDs will be Intel’s highest performance and endurance SSDs when they come to market. We will disclose final product performance and specifications at the products’ launch in coming months.” When we raised the supposed speed issue with the firm, an Intel spokesperson said: "Intel is not going to comment further on this topic at this time." ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 11 Comments More from The Register Peglar on the hoof: Micron flash and XPoint VP legs it Exits loss-making company for pastures new Micron sets a canary to watch over its stock in case of takeover Poison pill filing sparks speculation about aggressive buy-out action 5 Comments Micron, VMware, Supermicro, Nexenta doodle array designs Cosy club comes up with flashy little reference architecture Intel and Micron's XPoint: Is it PCM?

Santa Clara, CA – WEBWIRE – Thursday, September 29, 2016 Female comedian superstar Amy Schumer knocked electronic dance music (EDM) DJ Armin van Buuren off of the list to become the most dangerous celebrity to search for online, according to Intel Security. Now in its 10th year, the McAfee Most Dangerous Celebrities study, published by Intel Security, researched a broad list of well-known figures including actors, comedians, musicians, TV hosts, athletes and more. This research uncovers which celebrities generate the most dangerous search results that could expose fans to viruses and malware while searching for the latest information on todays pop culture icons. Amy Schumer is considered to be one of the most popular female comedians who is also known for her work as a writer, actress and producer. Now Schumer can add first female comedian to take the No.1 spot on the McAfee Most Dangerous Celebrities study to her list of achievements. Justin Bieber came in hot on her heels at No. 2, followed by Today and The Voice host Carson Daly (No. 3). Schumer is also accompanied by comedian peers in the top 10 with Chris Hardwick (No. 7) and Daniel Tosh (No. 8). Former rapper turned Hollywood A-lister Will Smith is joined by chart-topping musicians such as Rihanna (No. 5), Miley Cyrus (No. 6), Selena Gomez (No. 9) and Kesha (No. 10), rounding out the top 10 list. Savvy cybercriminals continue to leverage consumers ongoing fascination with celebrity news  such as award and TV shows as well as movie premieres, album releases, celebrity breakups and more  to entice unsuspecting fans to visit sites loaded with malware that can steal passwords and personal information. The study conducted by Intel Security highlights the various ways hackers can take advantage of consumers interest around pop culture news, the risks of their online behavior and how to best protect themselves from potential threats. Consumers today remain fascinated with celebrity culture and go online to find the latest pop culture news, said Gary Davis, chief consumer security evangelist at Intel Security. With this craving for real-time information, many search and click without considering potential security risks. Cybercriminals know this and take advantage of this behavior by attempting to lead them to unsafe sites loaded with malware. As a result, consumers need to understand what precautions to take to enable safe online experiences. A Search for Amy Schumer Torrent Results in a 33 Percent Chance of Connecting to a Malicious Website Amy Schumer topping the list highlights the trend of more people looking to cut the cord and move away from cable TV. Consumers are now, more than ever, streaming videos, TV shows and movies online. As file sharing and torrent use continues to grow in popularity, its no surprise that TV and movies are a target for cybercriminals seeking to create malicious files. The top 10 celebrities from this years study with the highest risk percentages include: Position         Celebrity                    Percentage 1                      Amy Schumer            16.11% 2                      Justin Bieber              15.00% 3                      Carson Daly               13.44% 4                      Will Smith                   13.44% 5                      Rihanna                      13.33% 6                      Miley Cyrus                12.67% 7                      Chris Hardwick           12.56% 8                      Daniel Tosh                11.56% 9                      Selena Gomez           11.11% 10                    Kesha                         11.11% Crowded with Comedians Kicking off her world tour this fall, comedian Amy Schumer tops the list as the Most Dangerous Celebrity  coming in at No. 1. Chris Hardwick (No. 7) of Funcomfortable fame and Daniel Tosh (No. 8) were also among the top 10, while Nikki Glaser (No. 15) and Kevin Hart (No. 25) made the top 25. Other funny females to make the list include: Grace Helbig (No. 26), Mindy Kaling (No. 30), Kristen Wiig (No. 52), Chelsea Handler (No. 54) and Ellen DeGeneres (No. 57). Musicians Top the Charts This years riskiest celebrities included some of the most sensational, chart-topping pop artists such as Justin Bieber (No. 2), Rihanna (No. 5), Miley Cyrus (No. 6), Selena Gomez (No. 9) and Kesha (10). Pop, rap, hip-hop and a bit of country were represented by Drake (No. 13), Katy Perry (No. 14), Jason Aldean (No. 16), Justin Timberlake (No. 17), Jennifer Lopez (No. 18), Lady Gaga (No. 19), Nicki Minaj (No. 20), Iggy Azalea (No. 27), Beyoncé (No. 28) and Usher (No. 29) as they rounded out the top 30. Late Night TV Shows Today show anchor and The Voice host Carson Daly is the third Most Dangerous Celebrity, while late night hosts Seth Meyers (No. 11) and Conan OBrien (No. 12) cracked the top 15. Host James Corden, widely known for his popular Carpool Karaoke, landed at No. 23, followed by John Oliver at No. 24 and Jimmy Kimmel at No. 32  previously No. 1 in 2014 and No. 26 in 2015. Bill Maher rounds out the list at No. 34. The Voice Coaches Make the Cut Three of the four celebrity coaches on The Voice this season, along with the host, are all in the top 50. Miley Cyrus leads the pack (No. 6), followed by Adam Levine (No. 41) and Blake Shelton (No. 66), as well as his girlfriend and rotating coach Gwen Stefani (No. 49). Blake Sheltons fellow country superstars Jason Aldean (No. 16) and Luke Bryan (No. 39) are not far behind. How to Search Safely Think before you click! Are you looking for the latest episode of Amy Schumers TV show, Inside Amy Schumer? Dont click on that third-party link. Instead, get your content directly from the original source at comedycentral.com to ensure you arent clicking on anything that could be malicious. Use caution when searching for torrent. This term is by far the riskiest search term. Cybercriminals can use torrents to embed malware within authentic files making it difficult to determine if a file is safe. Its best to avoid using torrents especially when there are so many legitimate streaming options available. Keep your personal information personal. Cybercriminals are always looking for ways to steal your personal information. If you receive a request to enter information like your credit card, email, home address or social media login dont give it out thoughtlessly. Do your research and ensure its not a phishing or scam attempt that could lead to identity theft Browse safely using protection like McAfee® WebAdvisor software. WebAdvisor will help keep you safe from malicious websites by helping to identify potentially risky sites. A complimentary version of the software can be downloaded at mcafee.com/mcafeewebadvisor Use cross device protection. Consumers need to protect all facets of their digital lives regardless of where they are, what device they use or where they store their personal data. Use solutions that work across all your devices to deliver protection against threats, such as malware, hacking and phishing attacks.

If you do decide to search for information on a major event or celebrity in the news, make sure your entire households devices have protection, such as McAfee LiveSafe service, which helps protect most PCs, Macs and tablets and smartphones. It also includes malware detection software, McAfee® Mobile Security, to better protect your smartphone or tablet from many types of malware. Survey Methodology Intel Security conducted the study using McAfee® WebAdvisor site ratings to determine the number of risky sites generated by searches, on Google*, Bing* and Yahoo!*, that included a celebrity name and commonly searched terms (noted below) likely to yield malware. From that, an overall risk percentage was calculated for each celebrity. Most dangerous means that these celebrities are likely popular search subjects. McAfee SiteAdvisor technology helps protect users from malicious websites and browser exploits. SiteAdvisor technology tests and rates nearly every internet website it finds, and uses red, yellow and green icons to indicate the websites risk level. Ratings are created by using patented advanced technology to conduct automated website tests and works with Internet Explorer*, Chrome* and Firefox*. Search terms included: Celeb name + Torrent Celeb name + Free MP4 Celeb name + HD download The results indicated the percentage of risk of running into online threats  if a user clicked all the results generated by the terms. Fans clicking on sites deemed risky and downloading files including photos and videos from those sites may also be prone to downloading viruses and malware.

Lynch has already said he plans to stay on for the next administration, but other highlights include the state of recruiting for the elite IT office: “I think that it’s changed a lot. In the early days, I think that you had to tell the story of who we are. A lot of times now, we’ll show up and they’ve at least heard of either [the U.S. Digital Service], the HealthCare.gov story or they’ll have heard of Defense Digitial Service.” Story Continued Below He also talked about the thing that most surprised him at the Defense Department. “My biggest lesson learned is that there is simply no way that we can continue to function without having nerds in the room. I believe that to my core,” he said. That we live in a world where all of these things that we created are now run by, and eaten by, software. We make decisions that are so critically important to the safety of the American people and the men and women who are defending the country, all those systems have to work perfectly and we’re making decisions where there’s not a nerd in the room. And that is — it’s not OK.” The full interview — including Lynch’s favorite lightsaber color — is here for Pros. HAPPY THURSDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity!

But team info is below, and be generous with them, please! COMEY ON DIY PHONE HACKING — FBI Director James Comey told a House panel Wednesday that the bureau might have to occasionally rely on others to help agents hack into locked phones at times, but that there’s some value in doing it in-house. Rep. Darrell Issa asked whether the FBI could also rely on the NSA. “That’s a reasonable question,” Comey replied. “It may be part of the solution. The real challenge is in using those techniques in the bulk of our work. Because it becomes public and exposed. But that has to be an important part of the conversation.” Likewise, while Comey said the FBI could again use contractors — as it did in breaking into the phone of a terrorist in San Bernardino — it’s also developing its own capabilities. “Whether that’s the best solution — it doesn’t strike me as the best solution — but we are, and I’ve asked for more money in the ’17 budget, trying to invest in building those capabilities, so when we really need to be able to get into a device, we can. It’s not scalable, and I’m not sure it would be thrilling to companies like Apple to know we’re investing money to try and figure out how to hack into their stuff.” MINI Q&A WITH MCAFEE’S CHRIS YOUNG — This month, tech giant Intel agreed to sell a majority stake in its cybersecurity business to investment firm TPG and restore independence to veteran security company McAfee, a transition that’s expected to go into effect early next year. MC spoke with Chris Young, who will head up the newly independent McAfee. Below are some exchanges, edited for length. What will be different under the new arrangement? The difference for us is, we’ll be 100 percent focused on cybersecurity. Intel has been great, but it does a lot of things, and cyber is one of them where Intel plays. This is going to allow us to continue to work closely, but as a standalone company, all we will do is cybersecurity. What should the next president focus on? No. 1, the federal government needs to be investing in cybersecurity talent and training. The Obama administration has introduced some good programs in this space, and we think we can expand that. The next one is international cooperation. We’re pretty quiet around what we do across borders in cybersecurity. We’re probably going to see more standards, more ways to internationally cooperate around threat information sharing. What threats are you thinking about most? The topic area I’m very interested in as I look forward is the convergence of new order types of attack categories with the penetration of security in our physical being. Ransomware converging with the Internet of Things creates a whole new set of attack scenarios that go beyond our traditional data breach view of the world. Physical safety threatened by a cyberattack is where I’m thinking. LAWMAKER: MAKE IT EASIER TO GET A CYBER JOB — Rep. Derek Kilmer on Wednesday asked the Homeland Security Department to heed a recommendation from a think tank and industry report to reduce the minimum credentials needed for a cybersecurity gig. Most cyber jobs, according to the joint report from Intel Security and the Center for Strategic and International Studies, require a bachelor’s degree, but cyber skills aren’t always picked up via traditional education. “I encourage the department to examine whether it would be possible to develop a cybersecurity hiring approach which permits the federal government to access professionals with critically needed skill sets who otherwise might be excluded from consideration,” Kilmer wrote in a letter to Secretary Jeh Johnson. NO THANKS, TOO RISKY — More than 15 million voters are so afraid of cyberattacks compromising November’s elections that they are considering not voting, according to a survey that cybersecurity firm Carbon Black will release today. The survey, released one month after an FBI flash alert about attacks on voter registration databases in Arizona and Illinois, found that 36 percent of voters thought their voter information was insecure. Carbon Black co-founder Ben Johnson told MC that his team was surprised how many people said they might not vote due to hacking fears. “We did the report really to drive awareness,” he said. “We are glad that people are waking up to the fact that there is a lot of risk.” The report urges states to implement paper audit trails for electronic voting machines, some models of which have been shown to be easily hackable. “We come from very intelligence community backgrounds,” said Johnson, a former NSA operator, “and we have had lots of experiences in the past where, if we had physical access to any kind of device, it was only a matter of time before we got in.” CYBER IS DARK AND FULL OF TERRORS — Digital attacks are increasingly exploiting the Internet of Things as it grows, according to a new report from Darktrace. The cybersecurity firm’s 2016 threat report, out today, delves into six real-world threats and trends. “With the cyber black market reaching maturation, the barrier to entry for would-be attackers is lower than ever. All industries are now being targeted by non-traditional attacks, particularly by sophisticated software that blends into the background of day-to-day network activity. Artificial intelligence is now being deployed by attackers to emulate legitimate user behaviors, automatically. Cyber warfare has become an arms race,” the report states. NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH VENTURE BROS. — Two “enterprising” cyber criminals are outsourcing aspects of their illicit business to pilfer credit card information in the United States and Nordic countries, FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence reveal in a report out today. Nicknamed the “Vendetta Brothers,” the group partners with other cyber criminals to employ a variety of tactics — including “brick and mortar” methods like deploying physical skimmers — to capture payment card data. The outsourcing makes it harder for law enforcement to pin down who exactly is responsible, concluded FireEye’s report. MORE JOURNALISTS TARGETED — Russian hackers have been discovered targeting the citizen-journalism website Bellingcat, which gained attention reporting on a Russian missile launcher used to shoot down Malaysian Airlines Flight 17. After running those stories, three Bellingcat researchers received spearphishing emails that tried to trick them into giving up their Gmail passwords. The security firm ThreatConnect analyzed the messages and determined they were consistent with the “tactics, techniques and procedures” of the hacking group “Fancy Bear,” which has been tied to Russia’s military intelligence service. Fancy Bear is also suspected in the hack of the Democratic National Committee. “As evidenced by these efforts and the attack on the World Anti-Doping Agency, organizations that negatively impact Russia’s image can expect Russian cyber operations intended to retaliate publicly or privately, influence, or otherwise maliciously affect them,” ThreatConnect’s team wrote in a blog post. ENERGY’S CYBER RISKS: Per our friends at POLITICO Europe: Energy companies have seen a massive increase in successful cyberattacks over the past year, and they need to address the risks in order to maintain their security and keep their businesses resilient, according to a report the World Energy Council released today. As the energy industry grows more interconnected and digitized, thanks to smart grids and other devices, it also becomes a more attractive target for cyberattacks. The worst case scenario? Infrastructure shutdowns, economic and financial disruptions and even deaths and massive environmental damage, it says. On the plus side, awareness has grown over the past three years, with more than 30 countries putting “ambitious” cyber plans and strategies in place, Christoph Frei, the World Energy Council’s secretary general, said in a statement. TWEET OF THE DAY — If this tweet were right, MC would be a very different newsletter.

Search Box Loading... Semiconductor Today : the first choice for professionals who demand timely, focused, top-quality coverage of the compound semiconductor industry. FREE Registration Home News Archive Features Directory Recruitment Events About Us Advertising Contribute News 29 September 2016 Siva Power recruits former First Solar and Intel veteran Bruce Sohn as vice-chairman Copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) thin-film solar module developer Siva Power of San Clara, CA, USA has hired solar executive Bruce Sohn as vice-chairman of its board. Sohn was previously the key executive in the growth of cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-film photovoltaic module maker First Solar Inc of Tempe, AZ, USA into an internationally recognized solar company, and he has also held leadership positions at Intel Corp. Sohn started at First Solar in 2003, serving on its board and guiding the firm through its formative years of growth. In 2007 Sohn became First Solar's president, leading it from the pre-revenue stage to a multi-billion-dollar enterprise. Under Sohn's leadership, First Solar achieved three historic solar milestones: the first Company to manufacture at under $1/watt, the first company to ship more than 1 GW of production annually and the first company to develop and engineer, procure, and construct (EPC) over 1 GW of utility-scale projects. Previously, Sohn worked at Intel for 24 years, where he played a leadership role in developing, engineering and manufacturing semiconductor technologies. At Intel he was a crucial part of the start-up team at five fabs, managed two of its largest fabs, and was program manager for the firm's conversion to 300mm wafers. Sohn graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with a degree in engineering, was a Clean Energy Ambassador to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and chaired the US Commerce Department's Manufacturing Council for the Obama Administration.  "It was under his leadership that First Solar, the only American thin-film PV success story, became what it is today," comments Siva Power's CEO Brad Mattson. "His guidance and leadership will be invaluable to Siva," he adds. "Siva has made impressive progress on its advanced thin film technology," says Sohn. "While the solar industry has steadily improved its position as a leading generator of clean, renewable energy, we are still at the threshold of the upcoming growth phase," he adds. "Terrawatts of clean power are yet to be installed and there is opportunity to make thin-film solar the lowest-cost, most environmentally friendly solution." Siva says that its roadmap will deliver lower electricity costs through advanced technology, scale, operational execution and an effective business strategy. Siva raised funds earlier this year to build a pilot line at its Silicon Valley headquarters, where it will produce CIGS modules based on its proprietary technology and manufacturing processes.  "Bruce's extensive experience in growing and managing large teams, and in global manufacturing capability, will prove to be a huge asset to Siva Power as we take our next step into giga-scale manufacturing," Mattson reckons.

In fact, just last week it was brought to light that half a billion Yahoo users suffered from a cyber attack that happened two years ago. Cloudera and Intel believe they can solve the ongoing cybersecurity crisis with a new open-source project: Apache Spot. “As an open-source community, we have both an opportunity and an obligation to deal with this problem,” said Mike Olson, chief strategy officer of Cloudera, at Strata + Hadoop world in New York today. Apache Spot, formerly known as Open Network Insight, is designed to be an open common data model that provides visibility into cybersecurity threats, and to provide advanced threat detection with Big Data analytics and machine learning. (Related: Microsoft announces new security capabilities) The Open Network Insight project started at Intel, and was launched as Spot earlier this year. Cloudera and Intel, along with Anomali, Centrify, Cloudwick, Cybraics, eBay, Endgame, Jask, StreamSets and Webroot, have been collaborating on Apache Spot to bring developers the cybersecurity capabilities they need in their application. “Let’s give one common data model that any application developer can take advantage of to bring new analytic capabilities to bear on cybersecurity,” Olson said. Cloudera and Intel recently announced a proposal to donate the project to the Apache Software Foundation. The foundation accepted the project into the ASF incubator last week. “The open-source community is the perfect environment for Apache Spot to take a collective, peer-driven approach to fighting cybercrime,” said Ron Kasabian, vice president and general manager of the analytics and artificial intelligence solutions group at Intel, in a statement. “The combined expertise of contributors will help further Apache Spot’s open data model vision and provide the grounds for collaboration on the world’s toughest and constantly evolving challenges in cybersecurity analytics.” Spot features a comprehensive cybersecurity hub, open data models, analytics collaboration, and a rich application ecosystem.

Intel to spin off cybersecurity unit McAfee by Staff Writers Washington (AFP) Sept 7, 2016 US tech giant Intel announced plans Wednesday to spin off its cybersecurity operations as an independent company under the name McAfee. The move comes six years after Intel announced the acquisition of McAfee, one of the leading antivirus software companies at the time. An Intel statement said the spinoff would be made with the investment group TPG, which would own 51 percent of McAfee, leaving Intel with 49 percent and valuing the group at $4.2 billion. Intel chief Brian Krzanich said in a statement that "security remains important in everything we do at Intel and going forward we will continue to integrate industry-leading security and privacy capabilities in our products from the cloud to billions of smart, connected computing devices." The new group will be one of the world's largest pure-play cybersecurity companies, and frees Intel to focus on new priorities such as wearables and other connected devices. "We believe that McAfee will thrive as an independent company. With TPG's investment, along with continued support from Intel, McAfee will sharpen its focus and become even more agile in its response to today's rapidly evolving security sector," said Jim Coulter, co-founder and co-chief executive of TPG. Chris Young, who heads the unit, will be CEO of the new company. Intel announced the $7.68 billion deal for McAfee in 2010 and closed the deal in 2011. The group is no longer affiliated with founder John McAfee, who was a fugitive from authorities in Central America and more recently made a run for the US presidency.

Gadgets 11 0 0 September 28, 2016 MacBook Air, MacBook Pro 2016 To Arrive In October? Erika Miranda Analysts revealed that the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 2016 will most probably be released in the market this coming October. Speaking with Forbes, IHS Securities analyst Rhoda Alexander revealed that there is a high possibility that new MacBook laptops will be out in the market — or at least, unveiled by Apple — either by late September or in October. According to Alexander, both the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro have entered production during the second quarter of the year which means it will be ready for release by the end of the third quarter to the beginning of the last quarter of 2016. “Production started in the second calendar quarter on refreshes of the 13.3-inch and 15.4-inch MacBook Pro [and] the 13.3-inch MacBook Air.” Since there is very little time left for September, Forbes is speculating that the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro will be slated for release in October. Tech Times noted that the prediction is possible considering that Apple is currently on a roll with the successful release and retail of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. However, the outlet also noted that while some may be happy that new MacBook laptops are coming, there are still a couple of major drawbacks in the matter. Since the IHS projection claims that production of the Apple laptops have already begun, there is a good chance that the device will not have the highly anticipated Intel Kaby Lake under the hood. Alexander echoes this idea, saying that “given the timing of the start of production, inclusion of [Intel’s] Kaby Lake chip appears unlikely.” Of course, some may continue to hope that the new Intel chip will still make it to the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro though the IHS analyst believes otherwise. In August, Intel unveiled its Kaby Lake processor which Anand Tech pegged to be a chip for better graphics performance while the Skylake processor which would most likely power the upcoming MacBook laptops is still undergoing several modifications. Intel’s 7th generation of Core CPUs are coming later this year https://t.co/q42Ncnv3nk pic.twitter.com/2sKuRIOv8U — Engadget (@engadget) May 31, 2016 Channel Pro compared the two and confirmed that the Kaby Lake chips are indeed better in terms of a “more optimized design.” However, analyst Daniel Matte told Forbes that there is also the possibility that Apple would be adding an option for MacBook Air and MacBook Pro users to opt for AMD’s latest “Polaris” graphics processors. Aside from that, Tech Times revealed that the MacBook Air is rumored to have an additional feature called the Pencil Trackpad based on a patent titled “Stylus with inertial sensor” that Apple filed back in November last year. Based on the description of the feature, Apple intends to add a stylus compatibility feature to the MacBook Air that could function in a lot of ways as described below. “Inertial sensor input may be gathered when operating the stylus in one or more inertial sensor input modes such as an air mouse mode, a rotational controller mode, a joystick mode, and/or other inertial sensor input modes.” [Image by Apple] In terms of size, the MacBook Air is slated to be a 15-inch laptop instead of the previously rumored 11-inch one which basically indicates Apple’s plan to make this particular line of laptops be bigger in the future. Additional features include a USB Type-C port, more RAM, enhanced batteries and cooling components, and a thinner design. Meanwhile, there is still a great chance that Apple is not giving up on the MacBook Pro 2016 though everything should still be taken with a grain of salt considering that there has been no official announcement on the matter yet.

Jason Merritt, Getty Images Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email LOS ANGELES Actress and comedian Amy Schumer is the most dangerous celebrity on the internet – and not just because of her no-holds-barred personality. Intel Security announced Wednesday that Schumer topped its 10th annual list of the most dangerous celebrities online. A search for the “Trainwreck” and “Inside Amy Schumer” star carries over a 16 percent chance of connecting with a site that carries viruses or malware. Following close behind, Justin Bieber was number two on the list, with a 15 percent chance of linking to malware.  “Consumers today remain fascinated with celebrity culture and go online to find the latest pop culture news,” Gary Davis, chief consumer security evangelist at Intel Security, said in a statement on the company’s website. “With this craving for real-time information, many search and click without considering potential security risks. Cybercriminals know this and take advantage of this behavior by attempting to lead them to unsafe sites loaded with malware.” Here’s Intel’s list of the top ten most dangerous celebs to search for online, based on its own security data: Amy Schumer​ - 16.11% risk Justin Bieber - 15%  Carson Daly - 13.44%  (tie) Will Smith - 13.44%  Rihanna​ - 13.33% Miley Cyrus​ - 12.67% Chris Hardwick - 12.56% Daniel Tosh - 11.56% Selena Gomez​​ - 11.11% (tie) Kesha​ - 11.11% Intel, whose products include McAfee security software, urged consumers to take precautions when they surf the web. In addition to recommending antivirus software, the company’s safety tips include: Think before you click! Beware of third-party links that may not be what they seem. If you’re searching for the latest episode of “Inside Amy Schumer,” go directly to the original source at comedycentral.com, not some video clip uploaded by a random user who may have ill intent. “Torrent” searches are especially risky. These file-sharing tools are often used by cybercriminals who embed malware. It’s safer to limit your video viewing to legitimate streaming options​. Protect your personal info. Think twice before you enter personal information like your credit card, email, home address or social media login. Online phishing scams​ can lead to identity theft. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

This Fool doesn't think so. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 28, 2016 at 11:21AM Image source: Apple.   Over the past several years, speculation has run rampant that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) intends to eventually replace chips from microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) inside its Mac products with homegrown ARM Holdings-compatible microprocessors. For a while, it seemed there was no immediate threat to Intel's Mac business, given the relatively large performance deltas between Intel's notebook processors and Apple's own A-series processors used in both the iPhone and the iPad. However, beginning with the A9 and A9X chips launched about a year ago and continuing on with the recently released A10 and the soon-to-be-launched A10X, it's clear that Apple's engineering teams are now able to deliver offerings that are truly competitive with Intel's low-power notebook processors. In other words, the argument that Apple's chips aren't powerful enough no longer appears to hold water. In that context, it's worth reconsidering whether Apple will ultimately boot Intel from the Mac line of products My bet is still: not anytime soon. Here's why. Apple can't easily or cheaply replicate Intel's product breadth Apple releases two high-performance processors each year or so -- one for the iPhone and a beefed-up version of that offering intended for the iPad. Last year, we got the A9 and A9X, and I expect that the A10X will follow the A10 that launched in September by approximately six months. If Apple were to replace Intel inside the Mac, it would need to build many more chips for each of its Mac products. Indeed, it would need to build chips for the MacBook Pro, the MacBook Air, the plain MacBook, and the iMac lines. Intel currently services the plain MacBook with its Y-series processors, the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro with its U-series processors, the 15-inch MacBook Pro and 21.5-inc iMac with its H-series processors, and the 27-inch iMac with its S-series processors. To be clear, all of the Intel processors that go into the Macs are based on the same fundamental building blocks -- CPU cores, graphics technologies, and the like -- but they are integrated in different quantities and proportions, such as CPU core count, graphics core count, and so on. Apple could certainly invest in building additional configurations/variants for a suite of Mac chips, but given that the company ships roughly 20 million Macs a year, which is just a fraction of the number of iPhones and iPads that it ships, the potential return on that investment might not be good enough. Focus, focus, focus! One of the reasons Apple's chip teams are able to execute so beautifully is that the company has a lot of the world's best chip engineers all working on a very targeted set of products. They don't have their hands full trying to build different chip configurations or weighing painful trade-offs to make its core technologies scale across too wide of a range. Each year, the company puts out arguably the world's best smartphone and tablet processors. Although Apple would still probably put out excellent chips for these segments with a broader focus, possible even including leadership products, somehow I think they would ultimately be less impressive. Intel already invests billions to try to build a wide range of personal-computer processors, and these chips have successfully powered all of Apple's Macs for years. Unless Apple thinks Intel won't be able to build chips that enable it to offer the Mac experiences it aims to deliver to consumers -- and that's unlikely -- then it simply doesn't make sense for Apple to switch to an in-house solution anytime soon.

Justin Bieber came in at No. 2, followed by “Today” and “The Voice” host Carson Daly (No. 3). Electronic dance music DJ Armin van Buuren was in first place last year. The company, maker of McAfee anti-virus software, conducted the study using McAfee WebAdvisor site ratings to determine the number of risky sites generated by Google, Bing and Yahoo! searches of a celebrity name and commonly searched terms. From that, an overall risk percentage was calculated for each celebrity. “Most dangerous means that these celebrities are likely popular search subjects,” the company explained.

Ubuntu 16.10 Isn't Shipping Vulkan Support By Default Written by Michael Larabel in Ubuntu on 28 September 2016 at 03:28 PM EDT. 10 Comments With Ubuntu 16.10 being right around the corner you may be wondering about its support for Vulkan. Here's my experience when trying out today's Ubuntu 16.10 "beta 2" release and looking for Vulkan support. Ubuntu 16.10 isn't shipping with Vulkan support installed by default. This is while Ubuntu 16.10 is making use of Mesa 12.0 and with that release was the Intel "ANV" Vulkan Linux driver as part of Mesa. However, there is the Intel Mesa Vulkan driver support available via the Universe repository. If you simply install the mesa-vulkan-drivers package on Ubuntu, you will have access to the Intel Mesa Vulkan driver (currently v12.0.3). Also on Ubuntu 16.10 within the universe repository is libvulkan-dev to provide the Vulkan headers (currently based on Vulkan 1.0.21) and libvulkan1 for the common loader library and then vulkan-utils provides the vulkaninfo command. So there's no support out-of-the-box for Vulkan on Ubuntu 16.10, but at least it's within easy reach now for the Yakkety Yak. Hopefully by the time more Linux games are shipping with Vulkan support, we'll see it shipping by default on future Ubuntu releases. There is also the matter in Ubuntu-land of still waiting on Vulkan Mir support, something originally talked about for Ubuntu 16.04 and two years after Canonical joined The Khronos Group. If you are a Linux gamer or enthusiast, the mesa-vulkan-drivers package probably won't be too exciting though since it's based on the four-month-old Mesa 12.0 and Ubuntu 16.10 won't get the next Mesa release. Thus with third-party PPAs like Padoka, you can still get the Intel Vulkan driver (including on Ubuntu 16.04) while enjoying Mesa Git for the very latest Vulkan support. Hopefully we'll see the RADV Radeon Vulkan driver merged into mainline Mesa too, thereby providing greater purpose for the graphics PPAs over this default package. For binary driver users, the nvidia-367 package on Ubuntu 16.10 has the NVIDIA 367.44 driver with Vulkan support. For AMDGPU-PRO, it's currently not packaged in the Yakkety archive. 10 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Strength in PCs leads Intel to raise Q3 revenue guidance Intel says PC makers are renewing inventory, which is helping boost chip shipments Agam Shah (IDG News Service) on 17 September, 2016 00:33 0 - - - - print email The PC market is showing signs of recovery, with Intel increasing its revenue guidance based on improved chip shipments. The chip maker has raised its revenue guidance for the third quarter to $15.6 billion, plus or minus $300 million, an improvement from $14.9 million, plus or minus $500 million. That's due to PC makers replenishing laptop and desktop inventory, which means Intel is shipping out more chips. It's likely in anticipation of the holiday season, when PC shipments rocket. "The company is also seeing some signs of improving PC demand," Intel said in a statement. In the second quarter of the year, PC makers slowed down chip orders and were clearing out existing stock of laptops and desktops. PC shipments declined by 4.5 percent during that period, according to IDC. Shipments of gaming PCs, 2-in-1s and Chromebooks are driving PC shipments. Microsoft's free upgrade offer to Windows 10 has also ended, which means users are more likely to buy new PCs to get Windows 10. Meanwhile, new laptops with Intel's Kaby Lake chips are now available. All the top PC makers have announced new 2-in-1s and laptops with Intel's new chips. New Kaby Lake chips for gaming PCs will be announced in January. Intel also has started shipping Pentium and Celeron chips, both aimed at low-cost laptops, based on the same architecture and code-named Apollo Lake. Many Chromebooks are based on Apollo Lake chips. Intel will announce third-quarter earnings on October 18. Brand Post Top 10 Things to Love about Surface Pro 4 More from Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 Join the PC World newsletter!

Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

The company, maker of McAfee anti-virus software, conducted the study using McAfee WebAdvisor site ratings to determine the number of risky sites generated by Google, Bing and Yahoo! searches of a celebrity name and commonly searched terms. From that, an overall risk percentage was calculated for each celebrity. “Most dangerous means that these celebrities are likely popular search subjects,” the company explained. NYC, in your inbox.

This Fool doesn't think so. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 28, 2016 at 11:21AM Image source: Apple.   Over the past several years, speculation has run rampant that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) intends to eventually replace chips from microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) inside its Mac products with homegrown ARM Holdings-compatible microprocessors. For a while, it seemed there was no immediate threat to Intel's Mac business, given the relatively large performance deltas between Intel's notebook processors and Apple's own A-series processors used in both the iPhone and the iPad. However, beginning with the A9 and A9X chips launched about a year ago and continuing on with the recently released A10 and the soon-to-be-launched A10X, it's clear that Apple's engineering teams are now able to deliver offerings that are truly competitive with Intel's low-power notebook processors. In other words, the argument that Apple's chips aren't powerful enough no longer appears to hold water. In that context, it's worth reconsidering whether Apple will ultimately boot Intel from the Mac line of products My bet is still: not anytime soon. Here's why. Apple can't easily or cheaply replicate Intel's product breadth Apple releases two high-performance processors each year or so -- one for the iPhone and a beefed-up version of that offering intended for the iPad. Last year, we got the A9 and A9X, and I expect that the A10X will follow the A10 that launched in September by approximately six months. If Apple were to replace Intel inside the Mac, it would need to build many more chips for each of its Mac products. Indeed, it would need to build chips for the MacBook Pro, the MacBook Air, the plain MacBook, and the iMac lines. Intel currently services the plain MacBook with its Y-series processors, the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro with its U-series processors, the 15-inch MacBook Pro and 21.5-inc iMac with its H-series processors, and the 27-inch iMac with its S-series processors. To be clear, all of the Intel processors that go into the Macs are based on the same fundamental building blocks -- CPU cores, graphics technologies, and the like -- but they are integrated in different quantities and proportions, such as CPU core count, graphics core count, and so on. Apple could certainly invest in building additional configurations/variants for a suite of Mac chips, but given that the company ships roughly 20 million Macs a year, which is just a fraction of the number of iPhones and iPads that it ships, the potential return on that investment might not be good enough. Focus, focus, focus! One of the reasons Apple's chip teams are able to execute so beautifully is that the company has a lot of the world's best chip engineers all working on a very targeted set of products. They don't have their hands full trying to build different chip configurations or weighing painful trade-offs to make its core technologies scale across too wide of a range. Each year, the company puts out arguably the world's best smartphone and tablet processors. Although Apple would still probably put out excellent chips for these segments with a broader focus, possible even including leadership products, somehow I think they would ultimately be less impressive. Intel already invests billions to try to build a wide range of personal-computer processors, and these chips have successfully powered all of Apple's Macs for years. Unless Apple thinks Intel won't be able to build chips that enable it to offer the Mac experiences it aims to deliver to consumers -- and that's unlikely -- then it simply doesn't make sense for Apple to switch to an in-house solution anytime soon.

Used with permission Most of the 21 open source software projects for IoT that we examined last week listed Linux hacker boards as their prime development platforms. This week, we’ll look at open source and developer-friendly Linux hardware for building Internet of Things devices, from simple microcontroller-based technology to Linux-based boards. In recent years, it’s become hard to find an embedded board that isn’t marketing with the IoT label. Yet, the overused term is best suited for boards with low prices, small footprints, low power consumption, and support for wireless communications and industrial interfaces. Camera support is useful for some IoT applications, but high-end multimedia is usually counterproductive to attributes like low cost and power consumption. IoT characteristics tend to apply more to endpoints – node devices that collect sensor inputs -- rather than gateways. Yet most gateways connect directly to endpoints rather than aggregating inputs from other gateways, and tend to be deployed in large numbers, often in remote areas. Therefore, they must also be affordable, efficient, lightweight devices. IoT modules and SBCs can often be used interchangeably in home and industrial settings.  Yet, boards for smart home hubs tend to be focused more on wireless support while industrial gateways are also frequently connected to serial, CAN, and other interfaces, or industrial Ethernet technologies like EtherCAT. MCU IoT IoT attributes are driven largely by the processor, and for endpoints, this often means microprocessor units. MCUs tend to run a lightweight real-time operating system, like the open source FreeRTOS, or are programmed with the Arduino IDE. Until recently, the poor wireless support on MCUs limited their appeal for IoT compared to applications processors running Linux or Windows Embedded. The only Linux that runs on MCUs is the aging and somewhat limited uClinux, and it only runs on higher-end MCUs. For several years, the trend has been to combine MCU-driven Arduino boards with MIPS-based wireless chipsets like the Qualcomm Atheros AR9331, running the more robust OpenWrt or Linino Linux distributions. There are still plenty of hybrid Linux/Arduino SBCs, including the Arduino Yún Mini and Atheros AR9432 based Arduino Tian. Others, such as MediaTek’s Arduino-compatible LinkIt Smart 7688, run OpenWrt on the MIPS-based Mediatek MT7688AN. Over the past year, low-cost WiFi SoCs, especially the Espressif ESP8266, have made it easier to build wireless-enabled MCU devices without requiring the overhead of application processors running Linux. The open source ESP8266, which is based on a Tensilica RISC core, can be modified to run Arduino sketches directly, if you flash it with an alternative, open-source firmware, as described on GitHub. The ESP8266 can also be reprogrammed to run FreeRTOS or the MCU-oriented, wireless-savvy ARM Mbed. The ESP8266 has shown up on Arduino boards like Arduino Srl’s Arduino STAR Otto and Arduino Uno WiFi and is frequently hacked into Arduino-based IoT DIY projects. Recently, Espressif shipped the ESP8285 -- essentially an ESP8266 with 1MB of flash -- and introduced a faster, Bluetooth enabled ESP32 SoC. ESP SoCs are not the only game in town. Arduino LLC’s MKR1000 board uses an Atmel ATSAMW25H18 for WiFi. Pine64, known for its Pine-A64 Linux hacker board, recently jumped in with PADI IoT Stamp COM based on Realtek’s RTL8710AF, a WiFi-enabled ESP8266 competitor that runs FreeRTOS on a Cortex-M3. Like ESP-based modules, the PADI IoT Stamp is tiny (24x16mm), power efficient, and dirt cheap, selling for only $2 at volume. Intel’s second generation, MCU-like Quark D2000 and Quark SE processors are also aimed at IoT nodes, in this case running lightweight RTOSes such as Zephyr. The Quark SE drives Intel’s BLE-enabled Curie modules for wearables, as well as Intel’s Arduino 101 board. Linux IoT Higher end IoT nodes require application processors running Linux, Windows Embedded, and now Windows 10. Home automation was the leading application in a recent HackerBoards survey of users of community-backed Linux SBCs. Other major categories included industrial applications such as data acquisition and HMI. Linux-based endpoints are typically used when you require more local processing and must run a web session or HMI screen. They often need to support a wider array of wireless radios or integrate cameras and audio. Linux is more often found on gateways, which aggregate data from IoT nodes. In many cases, however, the same embedded board can drive a low-end gateway or a high-end endpoint. That is often the case for the Raspberry Pi, one of the most commonly used development boards for IoT. It’s not that the Pi is particularly well-suited for the task, although the WiFi and Bluetooth on the Pi 3 helps. Yet, the Pi and its clones are small and affordable, and there are numerous IoT-oriented add-ons. IBM, Element14, and EnOcean collaborated on one such add-on. The kit combines a Raspberry Pi with EnOcean’s self-powered, energy harvesting wireless sensors, which gain energy from the motion, light, and temperature of the surrounding environment. IBM has supplied its IBM Watson IoT Platform for cloud-based IoT analytics. Many IoT platforms support the BeagleBone, which is better suited for industrial IoT and has numerous IoT add-ons. The Cortex-A8 and -A9 based Texas Instruments Sitara SoCs found on the BeagleBone and variants like SeeedStudio’s BeagleBone Green Wireless are widely used in IoT. For more processing power, NXP’s Cortex-A9 based i.MX6 is a popular choice. Like the Sitara, is supplies numerous industrial interfaces. i.MX6-based hacker boards include HummingBoard and Udoo models, as well as the Wandboard. Both the Sitara and i.MX6 are frequently used in commercial IoT boards, as well. Atmel’s Cortex-A5-based SAMA-branded SoCs are another IoT mainstay, found on devices such as as Artila’s Matrix remote monitoring computers. Even the aging ARM9 core continues to find a role in IoT due to its small size, low price, and low power consumption. LittleBits’ tiny, ARM9-based, CloudBit SBC connects to scores of LittleBits actuators, sensors, buzzers, dimmers, LEDs, and DC motors. Other hacker SBCs offer similar IoT add-ons. SeeedStudio’s Grove is one of the most popular family of sensor devices and is tapped by boards including the Intel Edison Kit for Arduino. The Creator Ci40, HobbitBoard, and HummingBoard-Gate, and other SBCs support MikroElektronika’s Click modules. Higher-end data acquisition devices are often built around Xilinx’s ARM/FPGA hybrid Zynq SoCs. Linux hacker boards based on the Zynq include the Parallella, Z-Turn, and Snickerdoodle. ARM’s power-sipping Cortex-A7 is increasingly replacing Cortex-A5, -A8, and -A9 SoCs in IoT nodes and low-end gateways. Popular -A7-based SoCs for IoT include NXP’s i.MX6 UltraLite (UL) and Samsung’s dual-core Artik 5 SoC/module combo. Allwinner SoCs are used on a number of Pi clones and other SBCs that end up in IoT projects, but as with Rockchip, Samsung, and Qualcomm SoCs, the higher end models are more typically used in higher-end, multimedia driven devices. Soon we will see IoT SoCs based on the Cortex-A32, the smallest, and most power efficient ARMv8 core to date. Cortex-A32 is much faster than the -A7 while offering 25 percent higher efficiency. (The S2 SoC in the Apple Watch 2 is rumored to be Cortex-A32.) On the x86 side, Intel may have given up on pushing its increasingly power-efficient Atom SoCs at smartphones, but it continues to aim Atoms at the embedded market. Its IoT-oriented Intel Joule module runs on the latest, 14nm “Broxton-M” Atom SoCs -- the quad-core Atom T5700 and T5500 – and is supported by the Yocto Project-based Ostro Linux. While Intel’s latest Quark processors are aimed at RTOSes, its original line of Linux-driven Quarks continue to target both IoT endpoints and low-end gateways. The Quark X1000 runs Linux, and has appeared on low-end IoT gateways such as the Advantech UNO-1252G. Higher-end gateways like Axiomtek’s ICO300-MI are more likely to use Atoms. AMD, meanwhile, has seen its x86-based G-Series SoCs rolled into various IoT boards and devices. The top-level gateways that aggregate and process data from other gateways tend the use more powerful x86 and ARM platforms. These systems feed data to IoT cloud servers where software, rather than hardware, is the IoT differentiator. Although industrial, rather than consumer IoT, will likely be the main driver of the industry over the next few years, it will largely remain invisible beyond the developer world. For most people, IoT is a Linux-driven smart home hub, and Android or iOS smartphone app, plus a kit full of “smart devices.” Next week, we’ll look at consumer-facing, Linux-driven home automation platforms, examining both open source and commercial options.

On the EVGA Z170 Classified K, EVGA expanded the  USB offerings to include dual USB 3.1 ports in the Back I/O cluster but also reduced the SuperSpeed USB 3.0 ports from 8 to 6.  Technically you still have 8 USB 3.0 ports, just two of them are now compatible with 3.1.  Ethernet options were expanded as well, to include dual Gigabit NIC’s, one from Intel and one from Killer. The various storage options has been increased, SATA ports include an additional 4 SATA 6G ports, or two SATA-Express, while the M.2 ports were increased from a single PCIe Key-M slot to dual Key-M and a single Key-E.  Memory support has also been updated to include 4x DDR4 up to 3600MHz+. EVGA Z170 Classified K Motherboard EVGA does a good job at keeping your motherboard selection easy, by providing three Z170 ATX motherboards with the same core features but slightly different advanced features.  This is a big change from many motherboard manufacturers that offer dozen options which can confuse potential users.  All of their Z170 ATX motherboards can be purchased at many online locations, and the Z170 Classified K can be found for $229.99 with free shipping while the Z170 FTW is available for a little less at $174.95. EVGA Z180 Classified K Features and Specifications 6 Layer PCB 2-Way SLI + PhysX M.2 Support High Gold Content for CPU Socket Killer E2400 NIC 8 Phase PWM Dual BIOS Support Onboard Power, Reset, and CMOS Restet Buttons Top Notch Integrated Peripherals Specifications Chipset Intel Z170 Socket 1151 Processors Supports i3, i5, and i7 SLI 2-Way + PhysX SATA 10 SATA 6G RAID 0, 1, 5, 10, JBOD USB 2x USB 3.1 / 6x USB 3.0 / 2x USB 2.0 Memory Support 4 DIMM Dual Channel DDR4 3600MHz+ (up to 64GB) Capacitors POSCAP/Solid State Ethernet 1x Killer E2400 1x Intel Gigabit NIC Audio 8 Channel High Definition + Optical Video 1x DP 1.2, 1x HDMI 1.4 Fan Headers 7 (2PWM, 5DC/PWM) PCB 6 Layers PCI-E Slot Arrangement 3.0 Support 1 x16, 2 x8 + 1 x4 + 2 x1 NVMe Support Yes Warranty 3 Years EVGA Z170 Classified K Front of Box EVGA Z170 Classified K Back of Box EVGA Z170 Classified K Accessories Packaging EVGA Z170 Classified K Motherboard Packaging EVGA does a good job at packaging their motherboards.  The retail packaging provides a good overview of the motherboard, and lets you know the key features and specifications, along with presenting an overview of the motherboard.  EVGA packages the included accessories individually, and separates the motherboard from the various accessories with a layer of cardboard.  On the bottom of the box the motherboard is in an anti-static bag, and a foam sheet to protect the bottom and the sides.  This is pretty standard packaging for motherboards, and has been shown to be highly effective. EVGA Z170 Classified K Accessories Since this is a motherboard, not many accessories are needed to get it up and running.  A detailed user manual, and a driver/software disk is included to help get you up; it is highly recommended to get the latest drivers from EVGA’s website.  In addition, there is a rear I/O shield, two SATA cables, a flexible SLI bridge and the rear I/O key.  For a motherboard that supports up to 10 SATA drives, two SATA cables seem to be a little light, most of us that build computers probably have a pile of them though. One word of warning about the rear I/O shield, if you place a GPU in the first PCIE slot, it will rub against the I/O shield, however EVGA has placed a piece of plastic on that edge to avoid any shorts.  If you use a backplate on the graphics card, you will most likely have issues.  When testing the EVGA Z170 FTW, we found that even though our test graphics card has a backplate, the EVGA GTX 970 would fit if the retaining screw was loosened a little. Let’s take a quick look at the Z170 Classified K and the test system before starting it up. Questions or Comments? View this thread in our forums!

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Amy Schumer Is Dangerous To Google Posted: Sep 28 2016, 10:10am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Sep 28 2016, 10:34am CDT, in News | Latest Celebrity News   Photo Credit: Getty Images Gallery 11 images   Comedian Amy Schumer is more "badass" than Justin Bieber. Do you have ot what it takes to google Amy Schumer? As a celebrity you know you have made it, when McAffee is putting your name on top of the most dangerous celebrities to search on the Internet. Don't Miss: The Black Friday Deals to Buy now on Amazon Amy Schumer knocked electronic dance music (EDM) DJ Armin van Buuren off of the list to become the most dangerous celebrity to search for online, according to Intel Security. Now in its 10th year, the McAfee Most Dangerous Celebrities study, published by Intel Security, researched a broad list of well-known figures including actors, comedians, musicians, TV hosts, athletes and more. This research uncovers which celebrities generate the most dangerous search results that could expose fans to viruses and malware while searching for the latest information on today’s pop culture icons. Amy Schumer is considered to be one of the most popular female comedians who is also known for her work as a writer, actress and producer. Now Schumer can add “first female comedian to take the No.1 spot on the McAfee Most Dangerous Celebrities study” to her list of achievements. Justin Bieber came in hot on her heels at No. 2, followed by “Today” and “The Voice” host Carson Daly (No. 3). Schumer is also accompanied by comedian peers in the top 10 with Chris Hardwick (No. 7) and Daniel Tosh (No. 8). Former rapper turned Hollywood A-lister Will Smith is joined by chart-topping musicians such as Rihanna (No. 5), Miley Cyrus (No. 6), Selena Gomez (No. 9) and Kesha (No. 10), rounding out the top 10 list. Amy Schumer appeared this week on Netflix's Chelsea. Amy Schumer and Chelsea Handler talked about the problems of becoming famous. Malware is now another problem for Schumer. A search for ‘Amy Schumer Torrent’ results in a 33% chance of connecting to a malicious website. If you have 'torrent' in your query, you have it coming though. Savvy cybercriminals continue to leverage consumers’ ongoing fascination with celebrity news – such as award and TV shows as well as movie premieres, album releases, celebrity breakups and more – to entice unsuspecting fans to visit sites loaded with malware that can steal passwords and personal information. The study conducted by Intel Security highlights the various ways hackers can take advantage of consumers’ interest around pop culture news, the risks of their online behavior and how to best protect themselves from potential threats. “Consumers today remain fascinated with celebrity culture and go online to find the latest pop culture news,” said Gary Davis, chief consumer security evangelist at Intel Security. “With this craving for real-time information, many search and click without considering potential security risks. Cybercriminals know this and take advantage of this behavior by attempting to lead them to unsafe sites loaded with malware. As a result, consumers need to understand what precautions to take to enable safe online experiences.” Intel has a couple of tips on how to stay safe when searching for Amy Schumer. How to Search Safely Think before you click! Are you looking for the latest episode of Amy Schumer’s TV show, “Inside Amy Schumer”? Don’t click on that third-party link. Instead, get your content directly from the original source at comedycentral.com to ensure you aren’t clicking on anything that could be malicious. Use caution when searching for “torrent.” This term is by far the riskiest search term. Cybercriminals can use torrents to embed malware within authentic files making it difficult to determine if a file is safe. It’s best to avoid using torrents especially when there are so many legitimate streaming options available. Keep your personal information personal. Cybercriminals are always looking for ways to steal your personal information. If you receive a request to enter information like your credit card, email, home address or social media login don’t give it out thoughtlessly. Do your research and ensure it’s not a phishing or scam attempt that could lead to identity theft Browse safely using protection like McAfee WebAdvisor software. WebAdvisor will help keep you safe from malicious websites by helping to identify potentially risky sites. A complimentary version of the software can be downloaded at mcafee.com/mcafeewebadvisor Use cross device protection. Consumers need to protect all facets of their digital lives regardless of where they are, what device they use or where they store their personal data. Use solutions that work across all your devices to deliver protection against threats, such as malware, hacking and phishing attacks.

Image: Featureflash Photo Agency/Shutterstock A list of celebrity names used most often to spread malware has been released, with Amy Schumer, Justin Bieber, Carson Daly, Will Smith and Rihanna as the top five. Intel has named Amy Schumer as the most dangerous celebrity to search online, with the company’s McAfee ranking finding the comedian’s name linked to a growing number of malware-hosting websites. The table lists which celebrities generate the most dangerous search results, exposing users to viruses and malware through casual browsing, by landing on dodgy, third-party web pages. “Consumers today remain fascinated with celebrity culture and go online to find the latest pop culture news,” said Gary Davis, chief consumer security evangelist at Intel Security. “With this craving for real-time information, many search and click without considering potential security risks.” Cybercriminals, said Davis, know our browsing habits all too well, attempting to lead us to “unsafe sites loaded with malware”. What is perhaps most interesting is how torrents are being targeted, with a simple search for ‘Amy Schumer Torrent’ resulting in a one-in-three chance of landing on a malicious website. Intel’s advice is to keep it all legit, by using original sources rather than third-party content. With Amy Schumer, for example, watching her show on Comedycentral.com is far more advisable than some other streaming website. Of course, given the internationally bordered access to content on legitimate websites, this is not always the easiest thing to do. Avoiding torrents is another nugget of Intel’s advice, noting the difficulty in determining just how safe a downloaded file is. “It’s best to avoid using torrents, especially when there are so many legitimate streaming options available,” said the company. The top 10 celebrities from this year’s study with the highest risk percentages include: Amy Schumer Justin Bieber Carson Daly Will Smith Rihanna Miley Cyrus Chris Hardwick Daniel Tosh Selena Gomez Kesha Amy Schumer.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 27, 2016 at 8:41PM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has long been known for its chip-manufacturing prowess relative to competitors. Its manufacturing technologies have often offered better performance than the competition, and it has usually been able to bring denser technologies -- that is, technologies that allow chip designers to pack more functionality into a given area -- to the market sooner than its competitors. However, in recent years, Intel's chip manufacturing peers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) have been working to try to narrow the gap. During the next couple of years, Intel is certainly going to face something of a public relations/perception nightmare as its chip-manufacturing peers transition to technologies that they refer to as "7-nanometer" -- usually smaller is better -- around the time when Intel will be in production on a technology that it calls "10-nanometer." Although there's more to a chip-manufacturing technology than density, it's a relevant metric that has a direct impact on the capabilities that these companies can, cost-effectively, put into their chip designs. A question that's worth pondering, then, is the following: Will Intel be able to maintain chip-area leadership with its 10-nanometer technology even as competitors transition to their "7-nanometer" technologies? I think the answer to that is "yes." Here's why. Comparing TSMC's public statements with Intel's I consider TSMC to be Intel's fiercest and most capable competitor. It's the world's most successful contract chip manufacturer, and over the last several generations, it has executed brilliantly in ramping new manufacturing technologies into production in support of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) A-series processors. In contrast, Samsung has lost Apple's business, and is even reportedly actively shifting focus away from contract chip manufacturing in favor of display manufacturing. In light of this, I think the most interesting discussion is one in which we look at Intel's and TSMC's public statements head-to-head. A metric that Intel uses (publicly) to compare the relative densities of two manufacturing technologies is gate pitch multiplied by cell height. (A visual representation can be found below.) Image source: Intel. Intel says that, using this metric, its 10-nanometer technology offers "close to a full generation lead in logic density," as illustrated in the slide below: Image source: Intel. Intel also claims that its 10-nanometer technology provides better than its historic 0.46 times scaling factor relative to its 14-nanometer technology, though the chipmaker doesn't specify by how much. In the table below, I show the gate pitch multiplied by minimum metal pitch -- a similar metric that Intel and others have used in the past in place of gate pitch multiplied by cell height -- for several Intel and TSMC technologies, as well as my projections. This is based on Intel's and TSMC's public statements for what future technologies will bring:   Intel TSMC 14nm/16nm 3640 5760 10nm <1674 ~2880 7nm N/A ~1766 Data sources: Intel and TSMC. At the 14/16-nanometer generation, Intel had a clear lead over TSMC in terms of density. TSMC says (via EETimes) that it will go into mass production on its 10-nanometer technology by the end of the year, and that it will provide a 50% area reduction compared to its 16-nanometer technology. TSMC's 10-nanometer technology should be superior to Intel's 14-nanometer technology in terms of chip area, and it should be in mass production before Intel's 10-nanometer technology. At 10 nanometers, Intel should see a scaling factor of something smaller than 0.46 times, per its own statements, resulting in the <1674 figure given in the table above. According to EETimes, TSMC claims that its 7-nanometer technology will offer a 1.63 times the density of its 10-nanometer technology -- an implied scaling factor of ~0.613 times. Intel should have a slight area lead Based on the analysis above, Intel's 10-nanometer technology should have a slight area lead over TSMC's 7-nanometer technology. What this means is that Intel's marketing claims that it's almost a generation ahead of TSMC are virtually worthless because TSMC's 10-nanometer technology should be in mass production before Intel's. In fact, in terms of timeline, TSMC's 7-nanometer technology is expected to go into mass production in the first quarter of 2018 -- approximately two quarters after Intel begins mass production of its 10-nanometer technology. (Intel's first 10-nanometer chips should go on sale in the fourth quarter of 2017 according to leaks, implying mass production starting in the third quarter of 2017). The reality is that, in terms of chip area scaling, Intel is likely to have a roughly six-month lead over TSMC. This, in the scheme of how long these technologies are expected to remain leading edge, is just not all that long. The good news for Intel is that, contrary to the marketing labels that TSMC (and other contract chip manufacturers) assign to their technologies, it won't actually fall behind its competition in terms of chip area scaling. The days of Intel having a substantial leadership position in this metric, though, are likely long gone.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

The production of new automobiles equipped with data connectivity, either through a built-in communications module or by a tether to a mobile device, is forecast to reach 12.4 million in 2016 and increase to 61 million by 2020. James Hines, Gartner research director, said: “Connected vehicles will continue to generate new product and service innovations, create new companies, enable new value propositions and business models, and introduce the new era of smart mobility, in which the focus of the automotive industry shifts from individual car ownership to a more service-centric view of personal mobility.” Gartner estimated that as cars become more connected they will also become more autonomous, which will see a rise in embedded in-car processing power. Automated driving functions, such as adaptive cruise control, collision avoidance and lane departure warning systems, necessitate real-time camera and sensor data processing and pattern recognition, the analysis company said. BMW recently announced in would be an early adopter of a new Atom-based platform called Joule, which uses Intel RealSense depth-sensing camera technology. The processing power needed to control an autonomous vehicle would be equivalent to a supercomputer in a car, Elmar Frickenstein, senior vice-president for automated driving at BMW, told delegates at the Intel Developer Forum in August. “Outside the car, you need a high performance cloud system to help with things such as swarm intelligence and route planning, plus a 5G network to enable exchange of data between cloud and car,” he said. At Ignite, the annual Microsoft developer’s event in Atlanta, car-maker Renault-Nissan announced a partnership with the software firm in which Azure will be used to power its connected car strategy. “A car is becoming increasingly connected, intelligent and personal,” said Ogi Redzic, Renault-Nissan Alliance senior vice-president, connected vehicles and mobility services. IT is already an integrated part of Volvo, according to Peter Lorentzon, the manufacturer’s vice-president of consumer IT services, speaking at a recent EMC event in Sweden. “We are at the forefront together with the business to drive change.” He said the company is focused on making the lives of consumers easier. “We don’t develop products just for the sake of technology.” Like many car companies, Volvo sees a need to move away from just selling cars. Lorentzon said: “We could just deliver hardware. But we need to spice up the car with other services.” He said Volvo was an early adopter of connected car technology. “Adding private services is something we are now focusing on.” As Computer Weekly has previously reported, Volvo has pioneered the delivery of Amazon purchases directly into a vehicle boot. The challenge for connected cars is how digital services remain relevant as the car gets older. Volvo Cars’ director of business development and strategy for consumer IT, Jonas Rönnkvist, said: “The car industry takes three to four years to develop a car, and it will be operational for 20 years.” Read more about connected cars IT has always tried to align with the business, but for Klas Bendrik, group CIO at Volvo Cars, it seems business has aligned with IT. At its recent investor day, Ford announced its strategy for the Internet of Things and how the company plans to make its mark in the connected car industry. He compared it to the launch 20 years ago of Microsoft Windows 95. “In the digital world you cannot imagine working on a Windows 95 computer,” he said. But among the big challenges the connected car industry faces is the longevity of a connected car. “It is difficult for us to predict what will be the next digital service in three years’ time.” Given that some digital services will have ended long before the car’s useful life is over, Rönnkvist said: “Digital services and infotainment is a challenge given the time frames of a car.” But, for the near-term, he expects cars to become part of a consumer’s integrated connected digital experience. He said: “Today people use more cloud-based services on many devices. So in the future you will use your music service at home, on your computer and in the car.” The challenge the car industry faces is how to make the experience seamless across all these devices. And in the connected world Rönnkvist believes car firms are at a disadvantage, because they cannot dictate standards and interoperability. He said: “We face Google and Apple and startups and we are not top of the food chain.” The connected car pushes IT to the forefront of the automobile business. Along with advancements in technology, car makers are also having to rethink how they work with digital suppliers. And as the car becomes more connected, the car maker is also having to support it and the software and digital services it runs. Rönnkvist said it makes car companies into IT operators. “Our core systems are supporting customers 24/7,” he said. CW+ Features Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join.

Stick It In (or On) Your Ear Analyst Says iPhone SE Was a One-Off for Apple View All Editorials → New Retina MacBook Pro Models Expected in October Jeff Gamet @jgamet · +Jeff Gamet Sep 29th, 2016 10:47 AM EST | News That new MacBook Pro you’ve been holding out for may finally be only a few weeks away. A new report claims Apple plans to release updated models in the second half of October. Reports say new Retina MacBook Pro models coming in October The refreshed Retina MacBook Pro line is expected to replace the keyboard’s function key row with a touch sensitive OLED strip that shows app-specific controls. The new models will also likely ditch the current USB ports for USB-C with Thunderbolt 3 support, gain Touch ID support, trim a little thickness off the body, and higher end models may switch to AMD’s Polaris graphics processor. It doesn’t look like the MacBook Pro will adopt the MacBook’s wedge-shape body and will stick with the flat slab style Apple has used for years, although the overall footprint will be smaller. Sources speaking with MacRumors narrowed Apple’s launch window to the second half of October, getting the laptops out in time for the holiday buying season and fitting in with previous year’s product launches during the month. Those sources didn’t say when Apple would announce the new models, but TMO’s say we should happen on October 11th. The last update to the Retina MacBook Pro line was in May 2015. Prior to that, the last update to the came in October 2013 with the switch from Intel’s Ivy Bridge processors to Haswell, making Apple’s pro laptop ripe for a refresh. Apple could use Intel’s Kaby Lake processors in the new laptops, although that’s something of a longshot. Intel is finally delivering the new chipset to device makers now, but ramping up production for the quantities Apple needs takes time. Intel may not be able to deliver enough Kaby Lake chips until next year, and if that’s the case the new MacBook Pro will ship with Skylake processors instead. While getting a Skylake-based MacBook Pro would be a little disappointing considering the chipset is already a year old, it wouldn’t be a game stopper. The differences between Skylake and Kaby Lake are incremental, and the next major change in Intel’s chipsets isn’t coming until 2017 with Cannonlake. Regardless of which chipset Apple uses, we should see a nice performance boost compared to the Haswell chips in current MacBook Pro models. Hopefully we’ll get better battery life, too. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit Tags: MacBook Pro, refresh 7 Comments Add a comment geoduck September 29, 2016 Eager for these to come out. You mentioned the week of the 10th. 9to5 Mac is saying the 24th. I hope TMO is right. As far as USB-C, if they have TB3 support that’s fine. I can get an adapter for my old devices. However they better have a bunch of ports. I’d like to see 4. The single port on the MacBook is absurd. I hope they keep the memory card drive too. I use it a lot. The OLED Function key row: Meh. Until I see how it’s used I’m withholding judgement. Skylake is fine John M., a few weeks ago, pointed out the performance difference isn’t that great so it doesn’t bother me. What I DO want is storage. That the low end MBP has a 128GB drive is an embarrassment. Bump that up to 256, have the second tier at 512, and top end 1TB with build to order at 2TB. I don’t care if Apple wants us to store stuff on the cloud. The cloud isn’t always accessible. I need local storage. Even if backups and archives, and indeed some files are in iCloud, I have hefty video files that I need to work with locally. I want space. While you’re at it bump the base memory to 16GB. It’s a Pro machine.

What We Know So Far [RUMORS] By Mariel Peralta Sep 29, 2016 | 3:11 AM Microsoft has been keeping mum about the details of the Microsoft Surface Pro 5, but rumors are saying that the hybrid laptop may be coming sooner than expected. Earlier rumors of the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 say that the device may be released in 2017 because the company is waiting up on Intel's Kaby Lake processors which will not be released until the end of this year. New rumors are saying that the Surface Pro 5 may be released as early as next month to rival the rumored release of the MacBook Pro 2016. Microsoft Surface Pro 5 Release Date, News and Rumors Microsoft may be releasing the Surface Pro 5 as early as next month in order to rival the release of Apple's MacBook Pro 2016, according to The Bitbag. There was an earlier report about Apple's laptop that stated the MacBook Pro 2016 may be having an October launch. The two laptops are in constant rivalry and that is why the rumors for an earlier release of the Surface Pro 5 have surfaced. According to the outlet, Microsoft plans for the Surface Pro 5 to have Intel's Kaby Lake processors. However, the chips aren't expected until the end of 2016 so the chances of the hybrid laptop having an early release are low. That is if Intel comes out with an earlier release of the chips this year, the Surface Pro 5 may have a bigger chance of having an earlier release at the last quarter of this year. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit Microsoft Surface Pro 5 Rumored Specs and Price The Surface Pro 5 is a highly anticipated device from Microsoft because it is a major flagship and because of its rumored next-level specs. According to Headlines and Global News, the Surface Pro 5 will have a display screen that can support 2K and 4K. The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will reportedly have several variations and some of the units may house either a Core i3 for standard models or a Core i7 for the higher end units. The hybrid laptop may also feature a USB-C port and a rumored rechargeable Surface pen that can be charged wirelessly through the tablet with a magnet. As for the price tag, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is rumored to fetch a starting price of $900 for the standard models. The high end models of the device may go for $1,600 each, Science World Report noted.

Lifestyle What your laptop decoration says about you Stick it to the man, says Rachael Sigee Rachael Sigee Thursday 29 September 2016 11:03 BST It used to be that toting a MacBook indicated you were one of three things: a graphic designer, a photographer or a DJ. The hardware designated creativity and modernity, and suggested that you’d likely soon be running a tech start-up. But now everyone in the coffee shop has the same gear so you need to customise your kit to stand out from the co-working crowd. If you’re the type to wear your opinion on your sleeve (literally), a MacBook decal is the way to go: there is seemingly a sticker for every taste. Vinyl Revolution has a perky selection, including the Amber Elise Pineapple, the Alice Searching Behind the Curtains and the Calligraphy Unicorn. Coverage isn’t just about looking good. In June Mark Zuckerberg posted a picture on Facebook to promote Instagram and potentially revealed more than he intended to. The internet noticed that he had covered both the camera and microphone on his MacBook with tape. Certainly the Facebook boss will have more concerns about security than most, but if you’re concerned about surveillance, SpiShutter is a discreet magnetic webcam blocker that will put your mind at ease without spoiling the look of your laptop (£15, spishutter.myshopify.com). Customisation is also an opportunity to advertise your skills. Cover the back of your laptop with a whiteboard or blackboard from Draw Attention and inscribe it with your email address, Twitter handle or — if you’re an artist or designer — scrawl an example of your work on it (drawattention.co).

It’s only 12.3mm thick when closed and also has an 11 hour battery life. Buying it with the Office and McAffee bundle will also save you over £80. £659, Currys PC World, Buy it now 4/8 Acer Chromebook 15 At a huge 15 inches, the Acer Chromebook has the largest screen of any notebook.

In this updated version you’ll find the latest Intel processors, better battery life and a retina display screen, all packed into a neatly compact model. The great thing about Apple Macs is that their innovative technology and design don't go out of date as quickly as other models, meaning the extra money you spend on the device really is an investment. Apple also offer up to 15% off for students, meaning you could save £150. £999, Apple,Buy it now 7/8 Dell Chromebook 11 For something that will be able to endure the perils of daily student life, the last one standing will be the Dell Chromebook 11. It may not be the most aesthetically pleasing, but it’s been specifically designed to withstand heat, dust, water spills and drops and has even passed US military standards- Geology and Geography students, I’m looking at you. £179, PC World, Buy it now 8/8 Lenovo ThinkPad 11e Lenovo have designed this specifically for students.

The Amsterdam-based founders of Uncover realised that the backlight that shines through your Apple logo spreads across the entire screen, and if you lasercut a design all the way across the laptop’s back it has striking effects. “Apple’s products are already iconic,” says Uncover’s Victor van Doorn, “but they’ve become so commonplace that it’s no longer a statement of personal creativity — now it’s almost an indication of conformity. We’re on this cat-and-mouse quest with Apple, where they keep making their MacBooks thinner and more repair-unfriendly and we keep finding ways to uncover them.” Read more 7 best laptop bags for students Its bespoke designs start at €499 and are prized by world-renonwned DJs including Jamie xx, tech CEOs from Evernote and Snapchat and even Dutch royalty — the King of the Netherlands has his own customised screen (uncovermac.com).  Meanwhile, if you’re missing old-school Apple Macs with the bright bulbous backs, channel the classic vibe by covering your logo with a vinyl rainbow sticker (£3.99, etsy/uk/shop/Supertogether) — which doubles conveniently as an opportunity to show your love for Pride.  And if you want to test your tattoo plans before you get that sleeve inked, Vinyl Revolution also stocks a selection of appropriate mandalas (vinylrevolution.co.uk).

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Lenovo ZUK Z2 smartphone By Desire Athow Review  Shares Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Verdict A capable smartphone that has been let down by three big issues. Pros Price Performance Multi purpose finger print reader Cons Firmware update No NFC No Band 20 Lenovo is already a well-established brand in Western Europe thanks to its personal computer brand which counts the legendary ThinkPad range and German manufacturer, Medion, amongst its ranks.  It also absorbed storage vendor Iomega, IBM’s Intel-based server business and NEC personal computer range.  The company recently acquired phone manufacturer Motorola, inheriting yet another iconic brand whose name still carries a lot of value for a mainstream audience. But the latest move of the Chinese company, which is already the biggest PC vendor in the world, has been surprising.  It launched a division called Zuk which is a Chinese-only brand, apparently aiming to compete with the likes of OnePlus One (a subsidiary of OPPO), Honor (a subsidiary of Huawei) and Xiaomi.  Gearbest sent us the Zuk Z2 which is its latest addition to its portfolio, one that goes head to head against the Honor 8 and the OnePlus 2. The phone costs just under £200 including delivery; we would suggest that you read this piece about the pros and cons of buying technology from online Chinese retailers (links to our sister website, TechRadar).  The design The phone bears a strong resemblance with the iPhone 5 No surprise there, ZUK uses the same sort of design that you’d find on premium models. Indeed, the phone has an air of iPhone 5 about it, with an entirely black finish. It sports lean lines and a minimalist design with dual 2.5D Arc glass front and back sides. As a business phone, the ZUK will have no problem displayed next to the latest high-end smartphones on the market. Not a hint of plastic here. The software is an entirely different story; more on that later. Glass is a premium material but suffers from three big disadvantages. It is fragile (despite what Gorilla Glass will say – note that the phone doesn’t use GG), it does attract fingerprints and it has a nasty tendency to slide on smooth surfaces (which often end up with a big thump when it hits the floor).  To Lenovo’s credit, it seems that they used an oleophobic coating to make the rear and the front less greasy.  The front fascia contains the speaker, a front facing camera as well as a physical home button that hides a few tricks. Just below that, on the shorter sides, is the headset input, the USB Type C connector and the speaker grill. On the side is the power button, the volume rocker and the SIM card holder.  There’s no micro SD card slot – the phone comes with 64GB by default - and two nano SIM cards, both on standby, can be supported.  At the back is a small ZUK logo – no mention of Lenovo – a single flash and the camera sensor. ZUK says that it used metal particle coating on the sides to enhance the phone’s look; what that means is that it makes it look matte. The hardware The ZUK Z2 is a powerhouse The phone’s dimensions - 8.5 x 142 x 69mm – is great for whoever is not a big fan of phablets; ditto for the weight which tops the scale at only 149g. Bear in mind that it has a smaller than average 5-inch display, coupled with a full HD resolution though, it does produce sharp pictures. More on that later.  As for most of the high end vendors – and unlike many of its tier-2 Chinese competitors which have opted for Mediatek chip - the Zuk Z2 uses a Qualcomm one, the Snapdragon 820, a beast of a processor that runs four cores at up to 2.2GHz and has an Adreno 530 GPU.  As expected, it supports 802.11ac, LTE (all UK 4G bands except Band 20/800MHz), LPDDR4 and Bluetooth 4.1. There’s also an array of sensors including a gyroscope, a compass, a hall sensor, a proximity sensor and a light one.  As mentioned before the ZUK Z2 comes with 64GB onboard storage; note that the phone uses the slower eMMC 5.1 technology rather than the faster – but more expensive - UFS 2.0 one. The rear camera sports a 13-megapixel sensor from Samsung while the front one is an 8-megapixel model. Both have fairly wide apertures (f/2.2 and f/2.0 respectively). And the rear camera can shoot at 4K. The smartphone also came with a USB Type C cable and a tiny adaptor with a Chinese plug but one which delivers far more juice than your average charger. It’s rated 2.5A at 5.3V which equals 13.25W or almost a third more than a standard mobile power adaptor.  Sadly, there’s no NFC capabilities which is simply unacceptable on a phone in this category. This short-range, low power connectivity mechanism has become more popular and omitting it automatically excludes it from some crucial use case scenarios like Android Pay.  In use A look at the connectors As expected, the components in the ZUK Z2 delivered a stellar performance; it blazed through the popular Antutu mobile benchmark, delivering a superb score of 140,058 which is within spitting distance of the leader, the OnePlus 3. The display uses the LTPS technology, probably from Sharp (now Foxconn); that’s a similar display used by the Apple iPhone 7. The pictures look crisp even in broad day light with an average contrast and excellent brightness. Colours are not too saturated and looked natural with excellent viewing angles; out-of-the-box options to tinker with the display settings are limited though. As expected – thanks to a pixel density of 441PPI – the icons and texts remained sharp. The sound quality is one of the few weak spots; the mono speaker failed to deliver the oomph and reach the highs of devices like the Sony Xperia Z3 which deliver sound through two front facing speakers. Audio quality remains a recurrent issue with Chinese smartphones.  One bright spot though has to be the fingerprint reader which can be configured and is not only fast (100ms response time) but also unobtrusive. The hardware only tells half of the story: bear in mind that this is a smartphone for the Chinese market so the installed firmware indicates that. We encountered Chinese characters when trying to update to the latest version of the OS (2.1.059 ST).  Sadly, that didn’t go as planned and is symptomatic of the sort of experience you encounter with devices that are not location-optimised. We had to install a VPN to download the most recent firmware update as ZUK’s servers wouldn’t allow anyone from outside China to do it. And even then, we couldn’t install it because the phone was apparently encrypted (we couldn’t find any option in the settings to disable it). Furthermore, although the ZUK Z2 came with Google Play, most of the other Google services (Youtube, Gmail etc) were not installed by default. At the time of writing, there’s no English version of the ZUK website which means no official support (you can always rely on unofficial third party user forums but at your own risk). As for the battery life, it was excellent. The 3,500mAh battery managed to keep the phone running for almost two days, albeit without any intensive tasks (no Youtube or gaming involved). Verdict A view from the top Clearly, using this phone is not for the faint hearted. The number of hoops you need to go through to get an OTA (Over the air) update is frightening and highlights the gulf that exists between established brands like Huawei or Samsung and those – who like ZUK - aspire to match them.  Obviously, Lenovo has no excuse to fall back on. The OTA experience should be much better than that even if it is a smartphone destined for the Chinese market. There’s also the lack of NFC which puzzled us as much as it disappointed us. And, while entirely subjective, the use of glass at the back instead of metal or plastic means that the phone is more likely to be scratched especially as it slides more easily on any surface with a gentle slope.   Ours got a few scratches within 24 hours. Sure, a protective sleeve or case would help but then doesn’t that negate the purpose of having a glass back in the first place? That combined with the fact that it doesn’t support band 20 (800MHz) makes it a no-no for O2 customers whose LTE service uses this frequency exclusively. MVNO customers from Giff Gaff, Tesco Mobile and Talk Talk are also in the same boat. In the end, the ZUK Z2 is a prime example of a phone that could certainly become a hit but will probably have to be sidelined until the major issues highlighted before are solved. The Verdict 3 out of 5 Lenovo ZUK Z2 A capable smartphone that has been let down by three big issues.

Join For Free Hortonworks DataFlow is an integrated platform that makes data ingestion fast, easy, and secure. Download the white paper now.  Brought to you in partnership with Hortonworks.  The Apache Hadoop project recently announced its 3.0.0-alpha1 release. Given the scope of a new major release, the Apache Hadoop community decided to release a series of alpha and beta releases leading up to 3.0.0 GA. This gives downstream applications and end users an opportunity to test and provide feedback on the changes, which can be incorporated during the alpha and beta process. The 3.0.0-alpha1 release incorporates thousands of new fixes, improvements, and features since the previous minor release, 2.7.0, which was released over a year ago. The full changelog and release notes are available on the Hadoop website, but we’d like to drill into the major new changes that landed in 3.0.0-alpha1. Disclaimer: As this release is an alpha, there are no guarantees regarding API stability or quality. The feature set and behavior are subject to change during the course of development. HDFS Erasure Coding HDFS Erasure Coding is a major new feature, and one of the driving features for releasing Hadoop 3.0.0. As described in this Cloudera blog post, erasure coding can reduce storage costs by up to 50% compared to 3x replication while maintaining the same or better durability. Moreover, as shown in a joint Intel-Cloudera blog post, erasure coding adds minimal overhead when using Intel’s optimized ISA-L routines, and can actually improve read and write performance in some conditions. Considering trends in data growth and datacenter hardware, we foresee HDFS erasure coding being an important feature in years to come. YARN Timeline Service v.2 3.0.0-alpha1 includes an early preview of YARN Timeline Service v.2, including. This includes container events, metrics, and application-specific information like the number of map and reduce tasks. The Timeline Service v2 is a new implementation that improves upon the scalability and reliability of TSv1, and enhances usability by introducing flows and aggregation. More details are available in the YARN Timeline Service v.2 docs. Shell Script Rewrite The Hadoop shell scripts have been rewritten with an eye toward unifying behavior, addressing numerous long-standing bugs, improving documentation, as well as adding new functionality. This update affects users who use Hadoop environment variables or integrate with the shell commands. See HADOOP-9902 for incompatible changes and other details, as well as the the Unix Shell Guide. Support for Multiple Standby NameNodes HDFS NameNode high availability with QuorumJournalManager uses a Paxos quorum to store the NameNode edit log. With a three-node quorum, this change means we can tolerate the loss of any one node and still continue operation. However, business-critical deployments may wish to run with higher levels of fault-tolerance, e.g. a five-node quorum to be able to tolerate the loss of any two nodes. QuorumJournalManager already supports an arbitrary number of nodes, but fault tolerance was limited since HDFS was only able to run a single active and single standby NameNode. Hadoop 3 eliminates this restriction by supporting running multiple standby NameNodes. This improves the fault tolerance of HDFS. See the updated HDFS HA docs for information on configuring multiple standby NameNodes. Java 8 Minimum Runtime Version Another major motivation for a new major release was bumping the minimum supported Java version to Java 8. This is critically important as Java 7 was end-of-lifed in April 2015, meaning Oracle would no longer publicly support it with security fixes. Thus, all Hadoop 3 JARs are compiled for a Java 8 language version, and require a Java 8 runtime version. This is also important because many libraries only support Java 8, so this bump allowing Hadoop to upgrade its dependencies to more modern versions. New Default Ports for Several Services To avoid bind errors on startup, the default ports of the NameNode, Secondary NameNode, DataNode, and KMS have been moved out of the Linux ephemeral range (32768-61000). See the release notes for HDFS-9427 and HADOOP-12811 for a full list of port changes. This update should improve the reliability of rolling restarts on large clusters. Intra-DataNode Balancer Intra-DataNode balancing functionality addresses the intra-node skew that can occur when disks are added or replaced. See the disk balancer section in the HDFS Commands Guide for more information. Stay tuned for more information on this feature in a future blog post! Miscellaneous The 3.0.0-alpha1 release is also the first release that incorporates a number of changes to the release process. We are now using Apache Yetus (incubating) to automatically generate our release notes and changelog from JIRA, a vast improvement over our previous system of manually editing a text file. Building the release artifacts has been Docker-ized and streamlined with a new create-release script, which improves correctness and enables us to make more frequent releases. Hadoop’s versioning scheme has been adjusted, letting us more easily release from multiple concurrent branches in parallel (e.g. 2.6.x, 2.7.x, 3..0.x), as well as the addition of -alphaX/-betaX tags. Conclusion Apache Hadoop 3.0.0-alpha1 marks a major development milestone on the road to a 3.0.0 GA release. The features and improvements listed here will eventually be incorporated into CDH after our usual rigorous testing and integration process.

Reuters/Stephen Lam Even though Apple has not yet confirmed anything about the MacBook Air 2016, not even whether it will be continuing with the Air line or not, some unconfirmed reports are hard to ignore. First of all, the reports state that an Apple MacBook Air is very much being made and it will boast of some amazing specs such as Apple Pencil, Retina Display and much more. Apple is reportedly refreshing its 13.3-inch MacBook Air and it is very much possible that the product may be released in October. Of course, inclusion of the Intel Kaby Lake processors in Apple MacBook Air 2016 seems unlikely if the device gets an October release. Apart from the Skylake processors, Apple may also consider AMD’s latest “Polaris” graphics processors. Rhoda Alexander, Director Tablet and Notebook PCs at IHS Markit Technology told Forbes that MacBook Air 2016 “production started in the second calendar quarter on refreshes of the 13.3-inch and 15.4-inch MacBook Pro [and] the 13.3-inch MacBook Air.” She also confirmed that Intel Kaby Lake processors are not coming to the device. Thus, Intel Skylake processors seem like a possibility for the MacBook Air 2016. Tech.Mic has reported that the device may sport a thinner design, a flatter keyboard and multi-functional USB-C port technology. This was also confirmed by Bloomberg in August. The MacBook Air 2016 is also expected to come with improved batteries and better cooling modules. The fingerprint scanner is expected to be incorporated in the Home button. Personal Digital Assistant Siri will be introduced to the device as well. According to Macworld, the Apple Pencil-enabled Mac trackpads will have features such as a rotational controller mode, an air mouse mode, inertial sensor input modes and a joystick mode. As per  NDTV, Apple could also be bringing the 5K display this October. If that is the case, then the 5K display technology may also be brought to the Apple MacBook Air 2016. In fact, the inclusion of this technology will infuse fresh enthusiasm in Apple fans for the Air line.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple The most dangerous celebrities to look up on Google Yoni Heisler BGR NewsSeptember 29, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share One of the more common ways that purveyors of malware are able to trick unsuspecting users into downloading malicious software is to prey upon the public’s insatiable appetite for celebrity news, photos and gossip. As a result, some celebrity-oriented search queries tend to be associated with a greater likelihood of downloading malware than others. As Intel notes, malicious actors are quick to put up websites “loaded with malware that can steal passwords and personal information,” especially in the days preceding new movie and music releases and in the days following a major celebrity breakup a’la the recent divorce news involving Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. DON'T MISS: An Apple employee just leaked details about the iPhone 8 Earlier today, Intel published its list of the “most dangerous celebrities” to search for, and checking in at the top of the list is comedian Amy Schumer. Filling out the top 10 are Justin Bieber, Carson Daly, Will Smith, Rhianna, Miley Cyrus, Chris Hardwick, Danieth Tosh, Selena Gomez  and Kesha. All in all, the list isn’t too surprising, though the presence of Carson Daly at number three is somewhat startling. Looking specifically at musicians, artists of note that didn’t crack the top-10 still include a who’s who of entertainers. This year’s riskiest celebrities included some of the most sensational, chart-topping pop artists such as Justin Bieber (No. 2), Rihanna (No. 5), Miley Cyrus (No. 6), Selena Gomez (No. 9) and Kesha (10). Pop, rap, hip-hop and a bit of country were represented by Drake (No. 13), Katy Perry (No. 14), Jason Aldean (No. 16), Justin Timberlake (No. 17), Jennifer Lopez (No. 18), Lady Gaga (No. 19), Nicki Minaj (No. 20), Iggy Azalea (No. 27), Beyoncé (No. 28) and Usher (No. 29) as they rounded out the top 30. While it should go without saying, Intel urges users to only click on search results from reputable sites and, naturally, to avoid any and all Torrent links.

Furthermore the investigation believes that the missile was launched by the territory controlled by Donbass militia. Nevertheless, the JIT said that the prosecutors do not link the MH17 downing to the Russian state of Russian citizens' actions. The team said that there are some 100 people involved "in one way of another" in the MH17 plane's downing. "The investigation is essential to ensure that those responsible face prosecution and to deliver accountability. Today’s initial criminal report offers clear evidence that the missile was Russian-made, and launched from within territory held by Russian-backed separatist groups. We ask that Russia now engages constructively with the findings and ongoing investigation," Johnson said. He noted that it was important to reveal motivation of the attack, identity of perpetrators and the chain of command. "The UK will continue to offer full support to the investigation and we urge all states affected by this tragedy to do the same. Alongside this, we will keep doing all we can to support the relatives of the ten British nationals who lost their lives," Johnson added. Russia categorically denies any involvement in the catastrophe. On Wednesday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Moscow is disappointed with the investigation of the crash and JIT’s conclusion confirms the case is biased and politically motivated. The Russian Defense Ministry said that the probe's data are mostly provided by the Internet and Ukrainian security services. Flight MH17 crashed with 298 people on board on July 17, 2014, in eastern Ukraine, while en route to Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam, leaving no survivors. Kiev and Donbass militia in Ukraine’s southeast have blamed each other for the downing of the MH17 plane. ...

Actress and comedian Amy Schumer topped the 10th annual list of the most dangerous celebrities to search for online. Intel (which sells McAfee antivirus software) ranks how likely you are to encounter malware or a computer virus when searching for the names of different celebrities.  Schumer, the popular star of “Trainwreck” and “Inside Amy Schumer,” was the riskiest search on the 2016 list.

Twitter Facebook Meet Apache Spot, a new open source project for cybersecurity The effort taps big data analytics and machine learning for advanced threat detection Katherine Noyes (IDG News Service) 29 September, 2016 02:41 - - - - print email Comments Hard on the heels of the discovery of the largest known data breach in history, Cloudera and Intel on Wednesday announced that they've donated a new open source project to the Apache Software Foundation with a focus on using big data analytics and machine learning for cybersecurity. Originally created by Intel and launched as the Open Network Insight (ONI) project in February, the effort is now called Apache Spot and has been accepted into the ASF Incubator. "The idea is, let's create a common data model that any application developer can take advantage of to bring new analytic capabilities to bear on cybersecurity problems," Mike Olson, Cloudera co-founder and chief strategy officer, told an audience at the Strata+Hadoop World show in New York. "This is a big deal, and could have a huge impact around the world." Based on Cloudera's big data platform, Spot taps Apache Hadoop for infinite log management and data storage scale along with Apache Spark for machine learning and near real-time anomaly detection. The software can analyze billions of events in order to detect unknown and insider threats and provide new network visibility. Essentially, it uses machine learning as a filter to separate bad traffic from benign and to characterize network traffic behavior. It also uses a process including context enrichment, noise filtering, whitelisting and heuristics to produce a shortlist of most likely security threats. By providing common open data models for network, endpoint, and user, meanwhile, Spot makes it easier to integrate cross-application data for better enterprise visibility and new analytic functionality. Those open data models also make it easier for organizations to share analytics as new threats are discovered. Other contributors to the project so far include eBay, Webroot, Jask, Cybraics, Cloudwick, and Endgame. “The open source community is the perfect environment for Apache Spot to take a collective, peer-driven approach to fighting cybercrime,” said Ron Kasabian, vice president and general manager for Intel's Analytics and Artificial Intelligence Solutions Group. “The combined expertise of contributors will help further Apache Spot’s open data model vision and provide the grounds for collaboration on the world’s toughest and constantly evolving challenges in cybersecurity analytics.” Brand Post Transforming Venues Through Digital Enterprise Practice More from Avaya Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Now, open source storage has begun to catch up, with, for example, open source file systems that have become the default for high-performance computing (HPC) and in other mainstream applications too. Some are clustered or parallel file systems, which are designed to be spread or pooled across multiple storage nodes for redundancy and performance, and then mounted on multiple servers. The best-known example is Lustre. Others are network file systems, such as Red Hat’s GlusterFS, and then there is the Sun/Oracle-derived file system and volume manager ZFS, which is widely implemented and underpins many other open source projects. In addition, open source storage has made inroads into object storage with Ceph (also Red Hat-owned) and OpenStack Swift, as well as in big data and analytics, where Apache’s HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) is a leader.  Too much DIY The factor that previously slowed the acceptance of open source storage was that it involved so much more DIY. An open source operating system will be designed to run on a range of hardware. Download the standard distribution package and install it on pretty much any mainstream commodity desktop or server, and it will discover the hardware and run. Sure, you might – just might – find a Linux distribution that doesn’t support your age-old graphics card or disk controller, but in general it will work. Open-source storage isn’t so easy. For a start, most users will already have storage that they know and trust and, more importantly, which already has their data on it. Switching storage platforms isn’t quite as simple as moving applications or virtual machines to a new server. Tuning the storage system There is also a lot of variation in the underlying hardware and the application’s performance requirements, so even where a standard storage software distribution could work – for example, if you buy commodity storage, which is essentially an x64 server with a shedload of disk or flash attached – there can be a fair amount of work required to tune the resulting storage system and customise it to specific needs and workloads. That is changing though, and fast. More freely downloadable packages have appeared, albeit mainly aimed at trial users. And more companies offer services to help with hardware/software integration and tuning, and then to provide the sort of enterprise-grade support that we have come to expect from the one-stop-shop storage vendors. One example is Red Hat, which sells services for Ceph and GlusterFS, branding the latter as Red Hat Storage Server. An even bigger boost for enterprise respectability comes from Intel, which combines the Lustre parallel file system with technical services and support to create commercial packages such as Intel Foundation Edition for Lustre (IFEL). “Enterprises seem to be picking up IFEL because it’s packaged,” says Laura Shepard, director of HPC markets at DDN, which builds high-performance storage appliances around Lustre and IBM’s proprietary GPFS file system (now Spectrum Scale), adding tools and a management layer. Paradoxically, free and open source storage first saw greatest acceptance at the two opposite ends of the scale. At the high end are the HPC systems, but at the opposite extreme, some small and mid-sized businesses have used software such as FreeNAS, NAS4Free (both ZFS-based) or Openfiler to turn a suitable server into a NAS or block storage appliance. Free software Other examples potentially suitable for small and medium sized businesses include several companies distributing free versions of their software, although these sometimes come with limitations. For example, Nexenta Systems’s community edition of its ZFS-based NexentaStor NAS server is limited to 18TB and lacks enterprise features such as replication and auto-sync. Shepard says one reason for the acceptance of open source storage at the high end is that the sort of organisations that demand the highest possible storage performance for their HPC work, such as government-funded national laboratories, are also the kind of organisations that have highly skilled academics on hand who can build and maintain such systems using open source. Meanwhile, the big private sector users of HPC – she suggests there could be as few as 10 petascale commercial computing systems in the world, all of them in the oil and gas industry – are similarly structured. “At that scale they start to look like the national labs, so they have teams who can support large Lustre implementations,” she adds. More on open source storage An open source file system can bring huge scalability, parallel file system capability and advanced features compared to those bundled with commercial operating systems. OpenStack and Hadoop fuel use of open source storage by cloud providers and large-scale Web firms, but enterprises remain cool to the idea. Indeed, the very openness of open source storage makes it easy for them to adapt and tune to their specific needs. Also, an important aspect is that by using open source storage you attract the sort of staff that these projects need. “With open source there’s a sense of community, which means you can ask questions and you have a voice. You aren’t just fed things by a vendor,” Shepard says. “You have people moving around and you need those people who would otherwise be working on data science in a national lab, say.” On the debit side, these are massive development projects, warns Giorgio Regni, founder and CTO at Scality, which has open sourced its S3 Server but not its core object storage technology. “It’s a big, complex distributed system, not something relatively easy like a web server or backup server,” he says.  “We need hundreds of servers just to test our code. Ceph is the same. It takes six months just to understand the code before you can start contributing, and then your contributions need to be reviewed and tested.” Growth in open source use However, as the DIY challenge diminishes and the availability of commercial-quality support grows, the deliberate use of open source software for storage is moving beyond the tech-savvy hinterlands at the far ends of the storage scale. Even at the lower end, where most of the earlier free and open source storage projects aimed to fill the gap between simple home NAS servers and sophisticated enterprise-grade storage from the major hardware suppliers, that is no longer the case. Several things have catalysed this, say experts in the field. One is that greater acceptance and use of open source storage at the infrastructure level is feeding through into other parts of the datacentre. Another is that as well as the commercial organisations that offer the technical services needed to implement open source storage at the enterprise level, there are companies using it to build off-the-shelf storage appliances. “It’s all in tuning the stack and making it turnkey,” says Eren Niazi, who founded his company Open Source Storage to build complete systems based on commodity hardware and an open source framework that includes ZFS. “People want simplicity, something that can be up and running in 15 minutes,” he adds. “We include a three-year support contract too – open source users do need support. There’s questions at first, then six months later there’s packages to update and security to consider, and then as the storage expands you need to add more hardware.” Add the almost accidental use of open source storage software, packaged within appliances or other open source platforms, and newer open source storage projects such as Ceph and OpenStack Swift, both of which are object storage platforms and are squarely aimed at the enterprise, and all the indications are that open source storage is not just ready for the mainstream – it is already there.

By Hyacinth Mascarenhas September 28, 2016 11:13 BST A search for 'Amy Schumer Torrent' was found to carry a 33% chance of connecting to a malicious website Mark Davis/Getty Images Known for her outspoken ways, American comedian and actress Amy Schumer is the most dangerous celebrity on the internet, Intel security announced on Tuesday (27 September). Knocking Dutch electronic dance music artist DJ Armin van Buuren off of the list, Schumer has topped McAfee's annual Most Dangerous Celebrities list study. Covering a wide range of well-known figures including actors, musicians, TV hosts, comedians and athletes among others, the research determines which celebrities churn out the most dangerous search results that could potentially expose readers to viruses and malware looking to read up on their favourite icons. According to the firm, a normal search for the 'Inside Amy Schumer' star comes with a 16% chance of connecting to a virus or malware-laden website. A search for 'Amy Schumer Torrent,' on the other hand, carries a 33% chance of connecting to a malicious website highlighting the growing trend of cord-cutting users moving away from cable TV towards streaming videos, TV shows and movies online. "Savvy cybercriminals continue to leverage consumers' ongoing fascination with celebrity news - such as award and TV shows as well as movie premieres, album releases, celebrity breakups and more - to entice unsuspecting fans to visit sites loaded with malware that can steal passwords and personal information," Intel notes. "Consumers are now, more than ever, streaming videos, TV shows and movies online. As file sharing and torrent use continues to grow in popularity, it's no surprise that TV and movies are a target for cybercriminals seeking to create malicious files." After the 'Trainwreck' actress, Justin Bieber came in second with 15%, followed by 'Today' show anchor and 'The Voice' host Carson Daly. Successful rapper turned Hollywood star Will Smith came in at number 3 followed by popular musicians Rihanna, Miley Cyrus and 'Funcomfortable' comedian Chris Hardwick. Here are the top 10 celebrities with the highest risk percentages: McAfee's Top 10 Most Dangerous Celebrities online 1. Amy Schumer - 16.11% 2. Justin Bieber - 15% 3. Carson Daly - 13.44% 4. Will Smith - 13.44% 5. Rihanna - 13.33% 6. Miley Cyrus - 12.67% 7. Chris Hardwick - 12.56% 8. Daniel Tosh - 11.56% 9. Selena Gomez - 11.11% 10. Kesha - 11.11% "Consumers today remain fascinated with celebrity culture and go online to find the latest pop culture news," Gary Davis, chief consumer security evangelist at Intel Security, said in a statement. "With this craving for real-time information, many search and click without considering potential security risks. Cybercriminals know this and take advantage of this behavior by attempting to lead them to unsafe sites loaded with malware. As a result, consumers need to understand what precautions to take to enable safe online experiences." Intel's study was conducted using its own site ratings to determine the number of risky sites generated by searches on Google, Bing and Yahoo.

Amy Schumer is the most dangerous celebrity online as hackers use stars' names to target internet users Intel Security analysed which celebrities were being misused by hackers Cybercriminals use stars' names to lure fans to sites carrying malware This allows them to download viruses or steal personal information  Amy Schumer, Justin Bieber, Rihanna, Ellie Goulding were all on the list By Associated Press and Richard Gray for MailOnline Published: 01:19 EST, 28 September 2016 | Updated: 06:36 EST, 28 September 2016 e-mail 13 shares 36 View comments Searching for the name of a celebrity online may be a hazardous activity according to a new report. Anti-virus experts have published a new list of musicians, TV and film stars whose names have been hijacked to attract internet users to sites that carry malware. Actress and comedian Amy Schumer topped the annual list of the most dangerous celebrity names to search for online. The comedian and actress Amy Schumer (pictured) is the most dangerous celebrity to search for online as hackers are using her name to lure unsuspecting fans to malicious sites that will install viruses or malware onto their computers to steal passwords and personal information Hackers use the fascination with celebrity news to entice unsuspecting fans to visit sites that can download viruses onto their computers and steal passwords or personal information. TOP TEN MOST DANGEROUS CELEBRITY SEARCHES  The top 10 celebrities from this year's study with the highest risk percentages include:  1 Amy Schumer 16.11%  2 Justin Bieber 15.00%  3 Carson Daly 13.44%  4 Will Smith 13.44%  5 Rihanna 13.33%  6 Miley Cyrus 12.67%  7 Chris Hardwick 12.56%  8 Daniel Tosh 11.56%  9 Selena Gomez 11.11%  10 Kesha 11.11% The study by Intel Security found that Justin Bieber, Carson Daly – host of Today and The Voice in the US – actor Will Smith and singer Rihanna were also popular choices for cybercriminals. In the UK, singer Ellie Goulding was the most dangerous celebrity to search for online, along with singer Rita Ora, producer Calvin Harris and Geordie Shore TV stars Charlotte Crosby and Holly Hagan. Nick Viney, consumer vice president at Intel Security, which is known as McAfee in Europe, said: 'The desire for consumers to stay up to date with the latest celebrity gossip can often make them unwittingly vulnerable to cybercrime. 'Many consumers are quick to click but do they actually stop and consider the potential risks this poses by doing so? 'Cybercriminals are keen to exploit this craving for real-time information on celebrities, and will lead consumers to sites that download harmful malware onto devices to ultimately steal an individual's all important, and incredibly valuable, data.

Share this article Share 13 shares Intel Security assessed the risk of sites when searching for celebrity names (shown above). Using terms like torrent, MP4 or free download with the celebrity name increased the risk Singer Justin Bieber (pictured) was the second most risky name to search for online according to the research by Intel Security. They warn that fans need to take greater precautions when searching for content by or about these celebrities 'It's clear more needs to be done to help consumers understand the threats online and what precautions they need to take to ensure their data, is kept safe when searching for celebrity news.' The research found that a search for Amy Schumer carries at least a 16 per cent chance of clicking on a site that carries viruses or malware. Searching for Justin Bieber carries a 15 per cent risk of being diverted to a malicious site. Often the sites were disguised as legitimate news sources but actually took users to sites that downloaded malware. Singer Ellie Goulding (pictured) was the most risky celebrity search in the UK followed by Charlotte Crosby and Rita Ora. It demonstrates how hackers are using the modern obsession with celebrities to target internet users The risk increases for those hoping to find free downloads of music or video featuring the stars. Searching for Amy Schumer Torrent increases the risk to 33 per cent, for example. To conduct the study, Intel Security performed common search terms on Google, Bing and Yahoo for celebrity names and examined the number of risky sites that came up. The firm then used this to calculate an overall risk percentage for each celebrity. HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF WHEN SEARCHING  Intel Security and McAfee offer a number of tips to internet users when searching for content about celebrities. Think before you click Are you looking for the latest episode of Amy Schumer's TV show, 'Inside Amy Schumer'? Don't click on that third-party link.  Instead, get your content directly from the original source at comedycentral.com to ensure you aren't clicking on anything that could be malicious. Use caution when searching for 'torrent'  This term is by far the riskiest search term.  Cybercriminals can use torrents to embed malware within authentic files making it difficult to determine if a file is safe. It's best to avoid using torrents especially when there are so many legitimate streaming options available. Keep your personal information personal Cybercriminals are always looking for ways to steal your personal information.  If you receive a request to enter information like your credit card, email, home address or social media login don't give it out thoughtlessly.  Do your research and ensure it's not a phishing or scam attempt that could lead to identity theft Browse safely using protection software McAfee WebAdvisor software will help keep you safe from malicious websites by helping to identify potentially risky sites.  A complimentary version of the software can be downloaded at mcafee.com/mcafeewebadvisor Use cross device protection Consumers need to protect all facets of their digital lives regardless of where they are, what device they use or where they store their personal data.  Use solutions that work across all your devices to deliver protection against threats, such as malware, hacking and phishing attacks. * Courtesy of Intel Security  Read more: Amy Schumer is No. 1 on the 2016 McAfee Most Dangerous Celebrities List | Intel Newsroom Share or comment on this article e-mail 13 shares Most watched News videos Autistic boy bursts into tears on stage as teacher snatches microphone Good pup!

Credit PHOTOGRAPH BY ODED BALILTY / AP Shimon Peres, the former Israeli President, died at ninety-three, a revered elder statesman, but his glory days were as part of a suspect young guard. In the early fifties, he was part of a cadre of defense officials whom David Ben-Gurion promoted in order to wrest control of the economy from veteran leaders of the Zionist Labor Federation and hand it to the fledgling state. Peres was at first hawkish, in favor of nuclear deterrence against Arab invasion and retaliation against Palestinian border attacks. He ended his career as a symbol of the peace process, after secretly initiating and championing the 1993 Oslo Accords, for which he and his co-signers, Yitzhak Rabin and Yasir Arafat, won the Nobel Peace Prize. “If I’ve changed my policies, it’s because the situation has changed. I was a hawk, but when we could make peace I was a dove,” he told David Remnick, in 2002. For his seventy years of public life, Peres was famous as a man who tempered his views to accommodate shifts in political power. He held almost every important government post—Prime Minister, Defense Minister, Foreign Minister, President—and served people he both idolized and reviled. After the Oslo negotiations stalled, and during the darkest days of the Second Intifada, Peres assumed his last significant position, as Ariel Sharon’s Foreign Minister, and stayed even after Sharon put Arafat under siege. Yossi Beilin, an Oslo negotiator and a protégé of Peres, was not impressed: of Sharon, he said, in 2002, “To do what he is doing now, he needs a rabbi to make it all kosher.” Beilin added, “In Shimon Peres, Ariel Sharon got the most kosher rabbi in the world.” Yet it would be wrong to suppose that Peres lacked governing principles. What set him apart, and prepared him for a short but pivotal premiership from 1984 to 1986, was political-economic prescience. Early on, he was a builder of Israel’s military power, becoming an expert on increasingly sophisticated arms. He grew fascinated by advanced technologies and, more important, the kind of society that advances them. In many ways, Israel’s entrepreneurial burst in the nineties was facilitated by Peres’s economic reforms of the eighties. It is no diminution of his achievement to say that he was Israel’s first technocrat. “The Arabs have the numerical superiority; we have technological superiority,” he told a cluster of reporters in 1974, while he was the Minister of Communications. “Technology will always defeat numbers.” Szymon Perski, who emigrated with his family to Israel from Poland, in 1934, at age eleven, was viewed, in the parochial pioneering society he joined, as both a potential recruit and something of an intruder. The view stuck, and he seemed to embrace it, making himself conspicuously useful to his elders in the socialist élite, but also nudging them toward vaguely bourgeois values. Peres spent his adolescence on a kibbutz and at the Ben Shemen youth village. He wrote lyric Hebrew poetry. The writer Yael Dayan, the daughter of the military leader and government minister Moshe Dayan, told me recently that Peres was “insecure as a young man, cultivated relations with writers, and probably hoped to become one.” His first distinction came in 1944, when, as a youth leader, he rushed from student group to scouting group, trying to keep the labor movement’s youth wing loyal to David Ben-Gurion’s governing social-democratic party, while much of the kibbutz movement, drawn to Soviet Marxism, parted ways with it. “Shyness and nerve are two sides of the same coin,” Peres later told his biographer, Matti Golan. Peres and Moshe Dayan were chosen as youth delegates to the 1946 Zionist Congress, in Basel, as plans for the partition of Palestine took shape. The following year, Peres joined the Haganah, the Labor Zionist self-defense force. Ben-Gurion personally made him responsible for organizing manpower, and for clandestine missions to buy weapons. These tasks kept Peres off the battlefields of the War of Independence, which earned him, unfairly, a lesser moral prestige than celebrated war heroes like Dayan, Rabin, and Sharon, who became his rivals for leadership positions in the seventies. In 1953, Ben-Gurion, who was serving as the Defense Minister as well as Prime Minister, appointed Peres his Director-General of Defense. Peres was barely thirty. Ben-Gurion extolled him and Dayan, the Chief of Staff, as examples of mamlachtiyut, or “statism”: the drive to absorb the flood of immigrants into nationalist, not proletarian, institutions. Ben-Gurion, exhausted, exited the government that year, but when he returned, two years later, Peres was his right hand, plotting Israeli participation in what would become the Suez Crisis, in 1956, and acting as the liaison to the French government. The connections would prove essential to setting up Israel’s nuclear program and acquiring the advanced jets that were critical to Israel’s victory in the Six-Day War, in 1967. But they also reinforced Peres’s enchantment with scientific management. Peres, who was elected to the Knesset in 1959 and became Deputy Defense Minister, grew impatient with traditional Labor Zionist condescension regarding market competition. He had seen what companies like Dassault, the French aircraft manufacturer, could do. That same year, Bedek, a company that Peres had helped found and the forerunner to Israel Aerospace Industries, produced its first plane. Beginning in 1955, Peres and Dayan were embroiled in what came to be known as the Lavon Affair, the fallout from a botched operation to discredit Egypt’s new President, Gamal Abdul Nasser. The controversy finally led, in 1963, to Ben-Gurion’s resignation. In 1965, Peres persuaded Ben-Gurion and Dayan to lead a new leftist, secular-nationalist party, Rafi, which would, in Peres’s words, bring together “famous and influential names from the worlds of art, literature, commerce, and science.” The Party went on to join a national-unity government just before the 1967 war, and a united Labor Alignment during the euphoria after it. But its challenge to the labor aristocracy continued to define Peres’s position. In the wake of the Yom Kippur War, in 1973, Prime Minister Golda Meir and Dayan, the Defense Minister since 1967, were forced to resign; the clique that had inherited the Labor Alignment, run by the Finance Minister, Pinchas Sapir, anointed Rabin as Meir’s successor. Peres, though still marked as having been part of the Rafi insurrection, unexpectedly announced his candidacy. He presented himself as the hard-liner, supporting the National Religious Party’s defense of the settlement project. Peres won forty per cent of the delegates’ votes, conceded, and was named Defense Minister. Rabin would later brand Peres an “indefatigable schemer.” When, in 1976, Rabin planned to remove by force a Jewish outpost in the hills of Samaria, in the northern West Bank, Peres intervened to let it stay. Rabin resigned over a minor financial infraction just before the election of May, 1977. Peres, his replacement, debated Menachem Begin, of the Likud Party, on television, insisting that it was the labor pioneers who knew how to settle the land. Begin won, concluded the Camp David Accords with Egypt in 1979, and increased the number of settlers to about ten thousand by 1981. Begin won reëlection that year, by increasing subsidies for staples and slashing tariffs on imported consumer products, setting off a spending spree among his poorer and less educated base. By 1984, government deficits, worsened by the Lebanon War, had pushed inflation to more than four hundred per cent. The election that year produced a tie for Peres, and he assumed the Prime Minister’s job for two years, in a rotation agreement with Yitzhak Shamir. This proved to be Peres’s finest hour, as he worked tirelessly with respected economists to prevent economic collapse and to enable future growth, privatizing or closing failing public companies and encouraging private investment. He introduced a new shekel, pegging it to the dollar, while imposing austerity and wage and price controls. He confidently oriented the economy toward technology exports, focussed on the defense technologies he had nurtured, reinvested in the universities, and advocated for tax holidays to encourage investment by foreign technology corporations such as Intel, Motorola, and I.B.M. By 1991, the chairman of Intel-Israel, Dov Frohman, told me that the country was primed to become a home to technology startups: “four for every direct foreign investor.” In the fall of 1993, I met with Peres, who was the Foreign Minister in the new Rabin government at the time, in New York. I was working for a consulting firm founded by, among others, the Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter. When I entered the room, Peres had Porter’s “Competitive Advantage” in his hands. He started off subdued, businesslike, but his face brightened when I asked how the state might facilitate an export-driven economy. He told me what many would later come to believe, that the competitive advantage Israel’s military gave it was not in its technology but in the “human capital” that the Army experience created: the teamwork, the comfort with advanced machinery. He spoke of Israel as a hub of a “new Middle East,” the name of a book he published that same year, which argued that economic integration, based on scientific exchange, had made war obsolete. At the same time, political vanity caused Peres to miss opportunities to build that new Middle East. In 1987, shortly before the first intifada roiled the Palestinian territories, Peres, who was serving as Foreign Minister under Shamir, secretly negotiated a deal with King Hussein’s representatives in London, which would have brought Jordan into the peace process and halted settlement building. Peres promised Hussein that, if Shamir rejected the deal, he would resign and mount an electoral campaign on the issue. Shamir did reject it, Peres did not resign, and Hussein renounced all interest in representing Palestinian claims. Peres was the indispensable proponent of the Oslo Accords with the Palestine Liberation Organization. But Oslo never produced a final-status agreement, and Rabin and Peres were put on the defensive by terror attacks and settler violence. After Rabin’s assassination, in 1995, Peres became Prime Minister, and the polls showed that he would have won an overwhelming victory over Benjamin Netanyahu had he called an immediate election. But Peres seemed determined first to prove that he could be charged with the nation’s security. He put the election off until the spring, and secretly authorized a series of retaliatory operations against Hamas terrorists, which led to retaliatory bus bombings. During the early spring, he authorized an action against Hezbollah in the north, Operation Grapes of Wrath, which included an errant strike against a Lebanese town in which more than a hundred civilians were killed. When an election was held in May, he lost to Netanyahu by less than a per cent. By the time Ehud Barak regained power for Oslo’s advocates, in 1999, the climate had been soured by settlement growth and terror, and in 2000 a new intifada broke out. Thereafter, Peres was something of a shadow figure in Israeli politics, taking back interim leadership of Labor in 2004, and eventually joining with Sharon and Ehud Olmert in forming yet a new party, Kadima, in 2005. After Sharon’s death, Olmert formed a government and organized a Knesset vote to elect Peres to the Presidency, a largely honorific role, but one the outsider seemed to thrive in, inviting “famous and influential names,” as he had once put it, to his official residence, encouraging ethnic integration, and promoting large entrepreneurial projects: the electric car, a canal joining the Mediterranean to the Dead Sea. He seemed to revel in the idea that he’d never again face an election. One is hard-pressed to know what was happening in the shadows, or to assess what political courage he had left. The late Ron Pundak, former head of the Peres Center and one of Oslo’s negotiators, told me just before his death, in 2014, that Peres had him deposed for his anti-government peace activities after 2009, “convinced that Netanyahu was serious about making progress toward a two-state solution.” Later in 2014, as his term as President was ending, Peres told Channel Two that he had met with the Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, in Jordan three years before, and that the two had worked out a comprehensive peace deal, including recognition of Israel as a “Jewish state.” Netanyahu, Peres claimed, had “stopped it.” Why did Peres not resign and expose the matter? Why, too, did he draw close to powerful mentors, adapt to new parties, take only the most calculated risks, and shift with the winds of war and peace? “Shimon never seemed far from the center of things, but felt himself the outsider,” Yael Dayan told me. “Shimon was the immigrant who knew the language well, who thought himself a man of letters. But he spoke with an accent; he had a certain paranoia.” The outsider’s restlessness seemed critical here. “Shimon was endlessly curious about the sciences, taught himself what he didn’t know: in chemistry, hydrology, nanotechnology, economics,” Dayan added. “He saw the Israel he wanted: advanced, democratic, multicultural, at peace. He did what he could to set the stage for it.” Bernard Avishai’s latest book is “Promiscuous: ‘Portnoy’s Complaint’ and Our Doomed Pursuit of Happiness.” He is a visiting professor of government at Dartmouth College and an adjunct professor of business at the Hebrew University.

Market research firm IHS ranked NXP as the seventh largest semiconductor supplier globally in 2015, while Qualcomm ranked third, trailing Samsung Electronics and top chipmaker Intel. Citing sources close to the matter, WSJ stated that the deal could be wrapped up within two or three months, or Qualcomm could move on to explore other options. Following the report, both company’s shares received a bump, with NXP jumping by 16.9 percent and Qualcomm up by 6.3 percent. Qualcomm’s successful Snapdragon mobile chip line brings in the majority of the company’s revenue, with added profit coming in from wireless patents that it licenses to the mobile industry — such as its recent Clear Sight dual-camera technology. According to a recent fact sheet produced by NXP, it has over 9,000 issued and pending patent families.

Photo Credit: Erin Geismar advertisement | advertise on newsday HIGHLIGHTS Huntington theater, opened five years ago, among top U.S. clubs Taking Back Sunday, Rod Stewart among the other headliners In five short years, The Paramount has already permanently changed Long Island. Consistently ranked one of the Top 20 clubs in the world by Pollstar magazine, the venue has even changed the look of downtown Huntington by adding a radio station studio that people can watch from New York Avenue. “The venue wants to thank all of Long Island for this unprecedented success and hopes that the next five years will be just as successful, as we push forward to become the No. 1 venue in the U.S.,” The Paramount’s directors said in a statement. Here’s a look at 10 of the biggest moments in The Paramount’s history so far: Most popular ‘Dr. Phil’ blasted for Shelley Duvall interview HBO ‘exploring’ ‘Game of Thrones’ prequel Christie Brinkley: I’m not a ‘former’ model Designer Sophie Theallet: I won’t dress Melania Trump Exes Lopez, Anthony kiss, duet at Latin Grammys 10. Elvis Costello (Sept. 30, 2011): The first official concert showed exactly what The Paramount owners wanted for the venue — an A-List act who would normally play in Manhattan playing Long Island so that fans could enjoy great music closer to home. 9. John Kasich (April 4, 2016): The Paramount was the center of the 2016 presidential race that day as Fox News hosted a town hall there with the Ohio Republican governor. 8. Shawn Mendes (June 10, 2015): The WBLI-sponsored concert with the Canadian sensation drew plenty of screams, it but also showed how up-and-coming Long Islanders like Melanie Martinez and Robbie Rosen could hold their own. Music11 LI entertainment places we loved 7. Chris Algieri (July 18, 2014): The Greenlawn boxer had fought at the venue several times, but this time the WBO junior welterweight champion was honored for his victories, shortly before challenging boxing legend Manny Pacquiao for a new title. advertisement | advertise on newsday 6. Rod Stewart (Aug. 30, 2016): The Rock and Roll Hall of Famer kicked off The Founder’s Room Legends Series, in which arena artists play rare club shows in The Paramount’s members-only, 450-capacity Founder’s Room. 5. Kevin Hart (Oct. 19, 2015): The “Ride Along” comedian had already become the first stand-up to sell out a stadium when he decided to do two surprise shows in one night at The Paramount. 4. Ed Sheeran (July 5, 2014): The British superstar, already used to selling out Madison Square Garden at that point, was rehearsing at the venue for a radio show and decided to open it to fans as an impromptu concert. 3. Taking Back Sunday (Dec. 27-28, 2011): The Long Island scene heroes loved the Huntington venue so much that they returned in 2015 to celebrate the club’s 500th show. MusicThrowback: Billy Joel plays The Paramount 2. Long Island Music Hall of Fame Induction Awards Galas (Oct. 18, 2012 and Oct. 23, 2014): The star-studded affairs that inducted the fourth and fifth classes of area stars showed how wide-ranging Long Island’s influence on music has been, from Debbie Gibson to Salt-N-Pepa, with Roger Waters and Dionne Warwick in the house to pay tribute to industry greats like Ron Delsener and Clive Davis. Tweets by ndmusic 1. Billy Joel (Oct. 16, 2013): Like so many Paramount patrons, Joel was impressed by the space. After seeing a few shows there, he decided to use it as a rehearsal space for an upcoming European tour and enjoyed playing there so much he decided to turn his final rehearsal night there into a concert, a benefit for Long Island Cares. As Joel’s first on Long Island since 2002 and one of the smallest venues (seating capacity: 1,563) he had played publicly in years, it became the hottest ticket the area had seen in years, drawing dignitaries ranging from Gov. Andrew Cuomo to actor Paul Rudd.

One challenge many universities face is keeping up with rapid advancements in the field. At the University of Southern California's Viterbi School of Engineering, IT is now at the center of education. "We have witnessed a rapid revolution in the way we prepare students for a successful career in engineering," said executive director of IT, Michael Goay. "Advanced technologies, including graphic-intensive 3D design applications, are a critical element in addressing these challenges." However, ensuring that IT systems have the processing power and flexibility to handle requirements—including the need for mobile and remote access to files across multiple devices—is no simple task. A few years ago, "We were facing a situation where, from an IT perspective, we required increasing processing power to run applications with an acceptable level of performance." At the same time, instructors were relying on more advanced graphics-intensive applications, such as computer aided design (CAD) and 3D CGI animation software. As a result, the engineering school embarked on a major IT infrastructure upgrade in August 2014. The school piloted VMware vSphere and Horizon View running on Intel powered Dell 12G PowerEdge R720 servers. The virtualization technology delivered a superior user experience and allowed the school to use IT resources far more efficiently. A year later, the school began expanding the technology framework with NVIDIA vGPU-enhanced virtual desktops and Dell Wyse thin client endpoints. Overall, the system now supports 6,300 students, across 27 classrooms, 900 desktops and laptops and 200 software titles. Quarterly student and faculty technology ratings have risen and the thin client approach supports the use of mobile devices, including laptops, tablets and smartphones. Although the IT project has presented more than a few challenges, success has followed. "As an early adopter of these solutions there were a lot of unknowns and some significant challenges; we had to experiment with how to run certain applications in a virtualized environment," Goay said. "Students have access to graphics-intensive applications anywhere and at any time—whether they are sitting in a classroom, an auditorium or at a dorm." What's more, many students rely on Mac laptops, but the engineering software typically runs on Windows. The virtualized environment makes all of this invisible and irrelevant to the user. "This has introduced a high level of flexibility," he added. Because the engineering school stores all the files and data on its internal IT systems, there's no longer a need to rely on flash drives and other portable storage devices, which are both inconvenient and represent an increased security risk. "Their data is safe and it follows them from device to device," Goay said. IT can provision and de-provision accounts and machines immediately—and restrict access to undesirable content. "The virtual environment is entirely sandboxed. Its sole purpose is for students working on school projects and homework. There's no reason to go there to watch ESPN or other entertainment," Goay said. Now that the university has the system operating smoothly, it is looking to expand the use of the VDI technology in classrooms and for disaster recovery. "This technology framework, including VDI, gives us a lot of flexibility and it has helped us manage costs far more effectively,” Goay said.   RELATED ARTICLES How to Deal With the Cyber Kill Chain Why IT Training Efforts Get Mixed Grades Why Business Departments Choose Their Own Tech How a Skills Gap Impedes the Use of New Tech Why Few Data Centers Are Fully Optimized   Submit a Comment Loading Comments...

Probably VR ADVERTISE SUBSCRIBE CONTACT ABOUT MACHINES Is the goal of democratising AI just a pipe dream? by John Kennedy 29 Sep 20167 Shares If the social media revolution has taught us anything, it is that tech giants will need real humans to give machines their vaunted artificial intelligence. Image: Michal Bednarek/Shutterstock Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Amazon, IBM and other tech companies have joined forces to democratise artificial intelligence (AI) and make it available for everyone. But what are their real motives? The AI world is exploding. 10 of the biggest power brokers have joined forces to bring some clarity to a world still fumbling with smartphones, and one that hasn’t quite gotten its head around what AI really means for it. It’s called the Partnership on AI to benefit People and Society. Sounds lofty and earnest, but these are businesses after all. Could this be more of the passive-aggressive PR shtick from a bunch of tech giants who talk about being open and transparent, but really prefer to keep you at arm’s length behind security desks and email addresses that no one replies to? It’s like talking up social media when your approach can at best be described as sociopathic. What snake oil is this? Do they want to improve AI as a team when they compete ruthlessly against each other? What are they really selling here? Remember dear human, you will always be the product The tech giants pushing AI are already driving significant advances; one might say that we are in the age of machine intelligence. For example, Intel recently bought Irish tech company Movidius, whose machine learning chip can help devices like DRI drones to see and understand. It’s like we are at the gates of Florence and the Renaissance is about to unfold. And it already looks magnificent. Microsoft is building what it claims to be the world’s most powerful AI supercomputer, which it plans to make available to everyone to harness the full power of AI. IBM’s Watson has been beating humans at chess for some time now. Facebook has already installed AI agents inside Messenger to converse with humans on behalf of businesses. Google’s latest neural machine technology can translate entire sentences from English to Chinese and vice versa. As for Amazon, God only knows what Jeff Bezos has up his sleeve, but it probably involves swarms of delivery drones or entire AI servers on demand (think Amazon Supercomputer Services) that will unleash another wave of entrepreneurship. But when big businesses talk about sharing the spoils of their advances in AI do they really want to share? What’s their real game here? In the dawn of social media, it was information. What you do with that information, that is called intelligence. It therefore makes sense to the masters of AI to invite society to their party good and early. Think about it. Humans are already product, when you consider the 1.5bn people who use Facebook every month. Humans are advertising fodder. It makes sense for Google to create free services like Translate or Gmail because it’s a captive audience for advertising. It’s not personal – well, it is – but it’s just business. Microsoft seems to be really taking this benefiting humanity stuff seriously. Not only did it promise free supercomputing resources, but it made a bold statement this week that it intends to infuse every application and device with cognitive capabilities. It has already done so in Windows 10 with Cortana, which it says has achieved 12bn queries from over 133m active users. Other examples include the photo editing tool Pix, which has apparent powers of perception and a location-aware app called MileIQ that helps you calculate expenses without doing much. Another thing worth considering is how AI could be used to replace humans in jobs. Who needs call centre agents when Facebook Messenger has bots that can carry a good conversation? Will AI reduce the number of people in the working world? Will robots take our jobs? What is the point in talking about democratisation when people won’t be able to put food on their plates? Or will AI go the other way? Will it augment our lives, make us more productive and lead to more opportunities for gainful employment and fulfilling healthy, happy lives? Let’s hope so. “AI technologies hold tremendous potential to improve many aspects of life; ranging from healthcare, education, and manufacturing, to home automation and transportation,” the Partnership on AI said in its mission statement. “Through rigorous research, the development of best practices, and an open and transparent dialogue, the founding members of the Partnership on AI hope to maximise this potential and ensure it benefits as many people as possible.” That’s fair enough. But you can’t help but wonder how AI is going to benefit these behemoths first before the rest of us figure it out.

Originally the X1 was just the X1 Carbon notebook, but Lenovo has decided to expand the X1 series to include the aforementioned X1 Carbon, along with the X1 Yoga and X1 Tablet. So the ThinkPad Yoga is now the ThinkPad X1 Yoga, and as such it keeps the same thin and light design of the X1 Carbon. The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga Review Thin and light is the key here, and the X1 Yoga doesn’t disappoint. The X1 Yoga is only 16.8 mm (0.66”) thick, and weighs 1270 grams (2.8 lbs). While not the thinnest and lightest notebook around, don’t forget that the X1 Yoga also features a 360° hinge, allowing it to be used exclusively with touch with several modes, including tablet, stand, and tent, just like the other Yoga devices they sell. Lenovo also pointed out that the X1 Yoga is thinner and lighter than the original X1 Carbon even, despite including touch and the convertible hinges. Lenovo is offering plenty of choices here to outfit the X1 Yoga, with the baseline offering of an Intel Core i5-6200U and 8 GB of LPDDR3-1866. You can upgrade to the i5-6300U, i7-6500U, and i7-6600U, with RAM offerings up to 16 GB. On storage Lenovo has gone all NVMe, with choices from 128 GB to 512 GB. On the display side, the 14-inch panel can be either a 1920x1080 IPS, 2560x1440 IPS, or a 2560x1440 OLED model. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga   As Tested: Core i7-6500U, 8GB, 512GB, 2560x1440 LCD CPU Intel Core i5-6200U Dual-Core with Hyperthreading 2.3-2.8 GHz, 3MB Cache, 15W TDP Intel Core i5-6300U Dual-Core with Hyperthreading 2.4-3.0 GHz, 3MB Cache, 15W TDP Intel Core i7-6500U Dual-Core with Hyperthreading 2.5-3.1 GHz, 4MB Cache, 15W TDP Intel Core i7-6600U Dual-Core with Hyperthreading 2.6-3.4 GHz, 4MB Cache, 15W TDP GPU Intel HD 520 300-1050MHz, 24 EUs Memory 8GB to 16GB LPDDR3-1866 Dual-channel Display 14-inch 1920x1080 IPS Optional 2560x1440 IPS Optional 2560x1440 OLED Storage 128GB to 1TB SSD, PCIe and SATA I/O OneLink+ USB 3.0 Type-A x 3 Headset jack 720p Webcam Mini DisplayPort microSD Dimensions 333 x 229 x 16.8 mm 13.11 x 9.01 x 0.66 inches Weight 1.27 kg / 2.8 lbs Battery 52 Wh, 65 W AC Adapter Keyboard Spill-Resistant with TrackPoint Wireless Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC8260 2x2:2 with Bluetooth 4.1 Price Starting at $1400, as tested $1871.10 Lenovo also offers plenty of connectivity on the X1 Yoga, including three USB 3.0 ports, HDMI, DisplayPort, and a OneLink connector for its docking stations. There are no USB Type-C ports, but the X1 Yoga does have MicroSD support for additional storage, and LTE-A as an option for those that want to be as untethered as possible. Wireless is supplied via the Intel 8260 wireless card, and as a business focused device it can be had with vPro as well. They also include a stylus built into the laptop which will charge while docked. It’s not as big or as comfortable as the one included with something like the Surface Book, but the fact that it is docked will more than make up for that for a lot of people, because that means it’s always available, and less likely to get misplaced. Lenovo has gone with a 52 Wh battery for this laptop, meaning it is over the 50 Wh baseline for Ultrabooks. That’s pretty good considering the inclusion of a stylus, and the thin nature of this device.

I run procurement for an architecture office. I wouldn't order this over an XPS 13 because you can get the XPS with Iris. They're not the workhorse of our office, but for getting some work done on an airplane and giving a presentation while manipulating CAD drawings, something with Iris or discrete graphics is critical. I can appreciate that the niche for professional ultrabook users who demand higher graphics performance is small, but to say that it wouldn't make the product more useful to professionals is simply shortsighted. Reply close - Friday, September 30, 2016 - link ddriver is usually here for two purposes: -some pseudo-engineering rants that are laughable until you realize he might actually believe them (then it feels like you're laughing at an autistic kid). -make some sort of homophobic remark, or any kind of insult really. The kind that suggests he was raised and educated by 4chan. Reply ddriver - Friday, September 30, 2016 - link I am glad you finally found a purpose in life. As pathetic as it may be, that's a huge step up for you LOL, your peak lifetime achievement really. Reply ddriver - Friday, September 30, 2016 - link You are joking, right? This is a convertible device that can be used as a tablet and comes with a stylus while the xps 13 is an ultrabook without tablet mode or stylus support. Which explains why the xps in a matching configuration is 100$ cheaper. If you are a professional and need to work with CAD you don't get a "business class" generic ultrabook, you get a laptop with dedicated professional graphics, or the very least, something with a decent discrete graphics, like the xps 15 Iris critical for CAD - that's laughable to say the least. But wait, since you did say "drawings" I can only assume you mean 2D in autocad, which, and I hate to break it to you, will show exactly ZERO advantage for iris over the plain integrated graphics. It will be marginally better for 3D, but nowhere near the 960m in the xps 15, which also has a bigger display at the same price point. Or maybe now you are also going to tell me that a smaller screen is also critical to working with cad and making presentations?

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple The Algorithms That Tell Bosses How Employees Are Feeling The AtlanticSeptember 29, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Share Every day, humans type out more than 200 billion emails, hundreds of millions of tweets, and innumerable texts, chats, and private messages. No one person could pick through even a tiny sliver of this information and stitch together themes and trends—but computers are starting to be able to. For more than a decade, researchers have been developing computer programs that can ingest enormous amounts of writing to try and understand the emotions stirred up by an idea or a product. The field—known as sentiment analysis—got its start in market research. As online reviews started to gather steam in the mid-2000s, companies who wanted to understand how their products—or their competitors’ offerings—were being received  began to use algorithms to aggregate reviews, says Bing Liu, a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois, Chicago, who has written extensively about the history of sentiment analysis. The algorithmic approach could reveal broader insights than a focus groups or surveys, the thinking went. Recommended: Email Etiquette Update: No Need for 'Best,' 'Cheers,' or 'Thanks' Sentiment analysis has bloomed into a large and lucrative industry. Dozens of startups now focus exclusively on providing these services to other companies, Liu says, and many bigger tech corporations have developed their own software. More recently, the corporate world has turned these same tools inward. Large companies like Accenture, Intel, IBM, and Twitter have started using the software to understand how their own employees feel about their jobs, and identify problems that might escape a harried supervisor during annual-review time. Twitter, for example, hired a company called Kanjoya to analyze employees’ responses to regular surveys about their workplace experiences. The surveys used to be administered twice yearly, and included just one or two open-ended questions, The Wall Street Journal reported last year. But with Kanjoya, Twitter started sending the survey to one-sixth of its workforce every month—and increased the number of open-ended questions it asked. Kanjoya’s analysis tools ran through the narrative answers, extracting patterns that were then shared with executives. Other companies have focused on analyzing employee chatter outside of formal reviews or surveys. To catch grievances that might not surface in structured responses, or identify policies that are working, IBM has for years been scooping up employees’ posts and comments on the company’s internal social networking platform. Recommended: How the Ballpoint Pen Killed Cursive That platform, called Connections, is available to all of IBM’s 380,000 employees in 170 countries. It functions like Facebook, Dropbox, and Wikipedia bundled into one package, allowing employees to publish posts, comment on others’, or collaborate in smaller groups. (IBM also sells a version of Connections to other companies.) An internally developed sentiment-analysis tool called Social Pulse monitors posts and comments for trends and red flags. Last year, IBM used the program to engage its employees in a revamp of its performance-review system. Its HR department set up a forum to solicit feedback on proposals for a new system, and received tens of thousands of responses. Instead of assigning a team of analysts to comb through the reams of feedback, IBM set Social Pulse loose on the data. The software helped surface a widespread complaint: Employees were unhappy that their performances were graded on a curve. The company promptly did away with the method, says Sadat Shami, who manages IBM’s Center for Engagement & Social Analytics. “Without our social listening capabilities, we wouldn't have been able to surface that in time to make that decision,” says Shami. “What traditionally happens in a month or two, we did in real-time.” Kanjoya, the company that helps Twitter interpret its employee-survey results, also offers a service that piggybacks on workplace social networks. A page on its website advertises that the company’s sentiment-analysis tools work with Yammer, a social network that was acquired for more than a billion dollars by Microsoft in 2012. (Microsoft announced this week that it’s combining Yammer with its Office 365 Groups service.) Kanjoya’s product offers “employee engagement tracking,” which promises to trace positive or negative emotions over time, and a search function that responds to queries with an analysis of the sentiment surrounding it. Read More Recommended: The Unbearable Smallness of Benjamin Netanyahu Broadening the scope of data-gathering from surveys and reviews to social-media posts risks invading employees’ privacy. That’s why IBM restricts its data-mining to posts and comments that are shared with the entire company, and doesn’t touch emails, chats, or interactions in private groups. Kanjoya was not available for comment on its privacy policies. (Federal insider threat-detection programs are experimenting with sentiment analysis, too, to suss out moles inside their own agencies. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency will award a contract to implement sentiment-analysis technology, NextGov reported earlier this month, the details of which are still vague.) Sentiment analysis is far from a polished technology. “The computer’s understanding of natural language is still bad,” says Liu. “Accuracy is not very easy.” A research project that tested basic analysis tools on a trove of emails sent between developers of an open-source server software suite only had a maximum accuracy rate of 30 percent. (Interestingly, when two people tried to determine the emotions expressed in 50 emails, they could only agree on three-quarters of them, says Tourani Parastou, the main author of the research paper at Polytechnique Montréal.) The human element still remains an important check on emotion-sensing algorithms. Even IBM’s 3-year-old Social Pulse software is bolstered by human eyes: A small team of analysts routinely examine the trends it identifies to make sure it got them right before sending them up the chain to management. Advancements in machine learning continue to improve algorithms’ ability to understand human writing—but researchers are already looking for the next emotion-detection technology. A pair of computer scientists at Sathyabama University in India published a paper last year that proposed a new way of determining employees’ attitudes and well-being: facial scans. The system they created captures images of employees’ faces every time they enter the building to determine whether they’re happy, sad, depressed, or angry, with the intention of using that data to optimize productivity and employee performance.

SAP is one of those organizations that has had to work hard to remain relevant in the cloud defined world. Like Oracle, IBM, Intel and many others, the German enterprise software giant has had to redefine its business model to remain competitive in the new digital economy. There has been progress but occasionally such companies are caught in the shadows of the leaders of the new hierarchy. When that happens noise needs to be made to make sure we don’t forget about them. That’s where we find SAP this week as the team announced its intention to spend €2 billion over five years to expand its IoT portfolio, and also to make a more significant impact on the connected services market. “With billions of connected devices, we now have the potential to reshape society, the economy and the environment,” said Bill McDermott, CEO of SAP. “SAP HANA is the data platform we knew would unlock the Internet of Things. Today SAP is making another bold investment to help our customers seize the benefits of live business. Only SAP empowers businesses to innovate from the core to the edges to the networks.” The investment will support SAP’s efforts to build several IoT development labs around the world and as well as launch a new product line, which the team have very sensibly named SAP IoT. No messing around and straight to the point, a highly functional name; does what it says on the tin. Good work all round. To support the growth of the IoT business unit, SAP has also announced a couple of acquisitions. PLAT.ONE, an enterprise-grade IoT provider, will provide the team expertise to ‘accelerate the availability of key IoT capabilities in SAP HANA Cloud Platform’, the team claims. Norwegian Fedem Technology will also be welcomed to the SAP family. Fedem will add a bit more weight to the analytics side of SAP, as the team aim to develop an (deep sigh) ‘end-to-end solution’ for the IoT world. The recent tie-up with engineering giant Bosch also adds weight. The partnership will use Bosch’s platform and SAP’s back-end software to connect vehicles, manufacturing machinery and tools of Bosch customers. SAP is still trying to figure out its place in the new digital world. Cloud was the focal point of all marketing campaigns in previous years, and now it would appear IoT is going to be the star performer. An uncharitable commentator could position this announcement little more than a plea for attention (don’t forget about us – we’re still important), though the two acquisitions do add a bit of weight to the posturing.

News & Analysis Consortium Forms Framework for Industrial Cybersecurity Rich Quinnell 9/29/2016 10:21 AM EDT Post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SEATTLE&mdash:The Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC) has released the initial version of its Security Framework for industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) development. The Framework, an adjunct to the IIoT Reference Architecture the Consortium released last year, seeks to initiate a process that will result in broad industry consensus on how to secure IIoT systems. The goal is to ensure that security is a fundamental part of an IIoT system's architecture, not simply bolted on, and covers the system end-to-end including endpoint devices and the links between system elements. The IIC is an open membership organization, formed in 2014 to accelerate the development, adoption, and wide-spread use of interconnected machines and devices along with intelligent analytics. From its founding by AT&T, Cisco, General Electric, IBM, and Intel, the Consortium has grown to more than 160 members from 24 countries and is now under management by the Object Management Group standards organization. "The Security Framework looks at IIoT security from three different perspectives," Hamed Soroush, the IIC's security working group chair, told EE Times in an interview. "Chip makers, equipment developers, and end users all have an important role in security for the IIoT, but often work without knowing one another's perspectives. The Framework will help them talk to each other." It also provides guidance to management on risk management when considering security, he added. Part of the motivation for creating the Framework is the difference between industrial IoT and consumer IoT security needs, Soroush noted, which calls for a discussion focused on industrial IoT system needs. Security in the industrial IoT should be more robust than for consumer IoT, for instance, to reduce the risks to critical infrastructure such as power generation. Also, unlike consumer systems, IIoT security needs to support decades long periods of deployment (which affects patch management), to preserve the integrity of high-availability systems, and to avoid conflicts with operational safety requirements. The Framework establishes a basis for discussions on how to address these needs. It also, Soroush pointed out, includes annexes that identify relevant existing security standards and best practices to guide developers. In addition, the Framework provides details on five characteristics — security, privacy, resilience, reliability and safety — that help define trustworthiness in the Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems that overlap in the IIoT, as well as defining risk, assessments, threats, metrics and performance indicators to help business management protect their organizations. The Security Framework is in its first version now, but the Consortium expects it to evolve over time. "We're already talking about what needs to be in the next version," Soroush said, "such as more elaboration on key points. But it depends on the feedback we get from users." He also noted that technology, standards, regulatory, and the security threat landscape are all continually changing, and those changes will inform subsequent version of the document. Revisions will also incorporate lessons learned from the exercise of test bed structures to see what is actually practical in various application classes. "One of the differences between the IIC and other organizations," Soroush said, "is the test beds it creates to evaluate the practices it suggests." The Consortium already has a number of test beds for evaluating IIoT system design, including such application areas as smart water management, precision timing networks, connected care, and edge intelligence. "The Framework will provide guidance to test bed builders for security systems, to provide feedback for the Framework's next addition." The IIoT Security Framework is available as a PDF document for any interested party, not just Consortium members. In addition, the IIC has invited the industry to join Framework editors and other security experts at a Security Forum on October 6th in Sunnyvale, CA. The Forum is complementary, but pre-registration is required. —Rich Quinnell covers industrial control for EE Times.

Zhongguancun Science Park is known as China’s “Silicon Valley” because it’s a technology hub where 20,000 technology enterprises operate and companies like Google, Microsoft, Intel, AMD, Sony and others have R&D centers of their own. The upcoming Apple facility will employ about 500 people and focus on the development of computer software and hardware products, communication, audio and video devices, as well as advanced technologies for consumer electronics products and the information industry, according to media reports in China. DigiTimes adds that the R&D center will also be used to “integrate Apple’s engineering and business teams for ramping up sales and services.” The facility should be completed in 2016. The Cupertino firm operates R&D centers in Japan, Israel and the United Kingdom and plans to establish additional R&D facilities in Canada, India, Indonesia and Vietnam.

By Zhai Yun Tan, Staff September 28, 2016 Save for later Saved Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella walks off the stage after delivering the keynote address at the Microsoft Build Conference in March 2016. Nadella is an Indian-born American. Eric Risberg/AP/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of While the technology industry is heavily criticized for lack of diversity, Asians are rarely part of the discussion, owing to the prevailing stereotype of Asians as engineers and coders well-loved by Silicon Valley. But a lawsuit filed Monday by the US Department of Labor may change the narrative. Palantir Technologies, a data company co-founded by tech financier Peter Thiel and partially financed by the investment arm of the Central Intelligence Agency, was accused of routinely discriminating against Asian job candidates in its hiring process. The lawsuit is the first of its kind against a Silicon Valley company, Rose Darling, a senior trial attorney for the Labor Department tells the Associated Press. The suit is unusual because company reports and industry studies show that Asians are overrepresented in the tech industry. Efforts to diversify hiring practices more often focus on adding women, African Americans, and Hispanics into the workforce instead of Asians. Recommended: Would Google hire you? 10 test questions to find out Palantir denied the allegations Monday and said it will contest the suit. It said that the government's case "relies on a narrow and flawed statistical analysis relating to three job descriptions from 2010 to 2011." Test your knowledge Would Google hire you? 10 test questions to find out Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/18 Still, the lawsuit brings some scrutiny to bear on Asian representation in Silicon Valley, bringing to the surface an issue that the Asian American community has rallied around in the past: Representation doesn't mean diversity has been achieved. While Asians are well-represented in the tech industry, the representation doesn’t extend to the executive level, a phenomena that applies to other minority groups as well. A study released May 2015 by Ascend, a pan-Asian organization of business professionals in North America, found that while Asians represent 27.2 percent of the professional workforce for tech giants Google, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, LinkedIn and Yahoo, only 13.9 percent of them are executives.   “The common assumption is that Asians are successful since so many of them already work in Silicon Valley companies,” Janet Wong, a former partner at KPMG and study co-author said in a press release. "However, our deeper EPI analysis reveals that while Asians are well-represented – even overrepresented – at the staff and professional levels, they are underrepresented in the management pipeline and barely seen at the executive levels." The executive positions are dominated by white men followed by white women, Hispanic men and Asian men, with black women and Hispanic women at the tail end. There are as many Asian professionals as white professionals in these companies, but the report finds that white women and men are 154 percent more likely to be an executive. Asian women are especially underrepresented at the management level. Some of the reasons the researchers gave for the small number of Asian employees transitioning to management positions include a lack of role models and gaps in leadership expectations and training. “I consider myself third-generation Chinese American, and I grew up with my parents and grandparents, and their culture was what I grew up with,” Ms. Wong told the Los Angeles Times in an interview. “They told me all I needed to do was stay in school, make good grades, and that was all I needed to be successful. They never taught me the soft skills or leadership skills. So when I started my career, I thought all I had to do was keep my head down, do good work, and I’d be acknowledged and have a successful career.” Other studies have also found  wage gaps between minorities and whites in the high-tech industry, although the gap between Asians and whites is smaller than for other minorities, as USA Today reported in 2014. Some Asian employees in the tech industry have spoken out on social media about that the lack of dissent in the Asian community, and theorized that it could be part of the reason why the problem persists. “We are the “model minority” – quiet, hardworking, well-educated, successful in a middle class sort of way.… It’s good enough that we don’t complain about the erasure of our individual identities and work ethic and personal successes, we don’t complain about the bamboo ceiling, we stay quiet on issues of race,” wrote Tracy Chou, software engineer at Pinterest in a LinkedIn post. “To my fellow Asians in tech: It’s time for us to start caring, to start talking, to start doing something about the racial disparities in our industry.” Some Asian Americans in the tech industry may feel awkward discussing this when it may seem as if they already have a foot in the door. Some may point to Indian executives at companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Nokia as examples of Asians representation in the tech industry, the Wall Street Journal reports.  Anil Dash, an Indian American and a two-decade veteran in the tech industry, argues in a Medium post that those are rare. In fact, Mr. Dash tells The Christian Science Monitor in a phone interview, the situation is getting worse compared to when he entered the field. “There has been a lot of pushback … (and sentiment of) I got in, why am i going to complain?” Dash says. “Especially for first generation immigrants who are excited about the opportunity, but also don’t know the tradeoff they’re making.” Dash points out the tendency for these companies to hire foreigners in the tech industry as one of the reasons. These employees with no permanent immigration status – many are Asians –  face problems securing their status and don’t hold much leverage in asking for career advancement. The Ascend report recommends examining the hiring processes to ensure biases are absent and to develop culture-specific leadership programs. Many tech companies now  have initiatives to increase the numbers of Asians and other minorities in leadership positions, The Los Angeles Times reports. Dash, like Chou, says he believes that Asians in the tech industry, especially Asian men, should begin speaking up for themselves and for other minority groups. Non-Asian minority groups still face hurdles in accessing capital, technology, and perceptional biases in even getting their foot in the door compared to Asians. “We should acknowledge that we haven’t said enough about anti-Black and anti-Latino attitudes, and that we have not articulated our complicity in industry sexism and misogyny. Indeed, we have often helped build these systems of exclusion, not merely remained silent while they were enforced,” he wrote in the Medium post two years ago. “We can do justice to our peers and coworkers who are working in an unfair system, bringing them closer to the level playing field they deserve.” Next up Test your knowledge Would Google hire you? 10 test questions to find out Focus Can familiarity build trust?

An opera singer and corporate creativity maestro, David bridges the gap between the arts and business in surprisingly creative ways. (David Pearl) LONDON, U.K.—A dreary November day stuck in a London bus. The stench of passengers, noisy children, barking dogs. The mood is dull. I don’t want to be here, thought David Pearl. Then he thought again. “Suddenly my brain said: ‘Just imagine if you were dead David, and you were given a minute back on life but you had to take it here. Would you be complaining? Would you take a minute?’ “I would definitely take this minute. Just 60 seconds of normal life. I would not be complaining, I would be amazed at fellow human beings, I would savour the smell of the sweat, I would enjoy the aches of my body.” He’s taken that “let’s do this now” energy with him ever since. “You know, maybe there’s never going to be a tomorrow,” he said spiritedly. It’s been a theme in David’s life and career: finding that magic and meaning in mundane moments. Now he helps business leaders think outside-the-box. He’s worked with influential people in some of the biggest companies in the world, like GlaxoSmithKline, Google, Intel, and Barclays, and runs an arts company and a social enterprise on the side. But getting there hasn’t been an easy ride. A Turning Point It wouldn’t cross your mind that David, an enterprising 56-year-old, sitting comfortably with a coffee in a central London café, has survived two suicide attempts. The real low points in his life, like a dark and desolate abyss, were incredibly dangerous. When he was a university student at Cambridge he tried to commit suicide, for the second time. The first attempt was when he was a teenager. “I think when I look back it was bad luck,” he said. “You can deal with one difficult thing, or two, but five in a row? It’s like buckets coming at once. I’ve noticed with people they can deal with any one of them individually, a break up of a relationship, work pressure, feeling not good in your skin, worry about the future … all of those were happening, changes I guess, and it all happened at once,” he recalled. Now, he talks about embracing his life’s lows and still counts himself as one of the lucky ones. “It’s actually been a fuel for all the work I’ve done since. It helped me understand that we have highs and lows, and the lows can be incredibly productive. They are not necessarily pleasant but they can be incredibly productive.” Lows force you to think about the deeper things in life, he said, but he doesn’t advocate depression. He recently spoke about it at a talk hosted by Google, as he felt that many business people suffer in silence. “I wanted to talk out and say, listen, you’re not alone mate,” he said, perhaps challenging the stigma around emotional health in the corporate world. He has the demeanour of a performer as he speaks. It’s no surprise, as he has been an opera star since he was a young child after his school teacher spotted his talent. He debuted with Placido Domingo at age 9 at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden and sang professionally there until age 13. That exposure to the opera world at such a young age, where he was a schoolboy by day and an opera singer by night, deeply touched his heart. “It was the real-ist thing I ever heard. It wasn’t the stupid story or the crazy costumes, it was the power of the music, tucked through all the everyday stuff. It wasn’t opera it was life to be this bright, and it can be this beautiful,” he said. The people for me who seem to do best and be happiest are the people who know their why. — David Pearl After working part time as a writer for film director Stanley Kubrick while studying at university, he continued his journey as an advertising writer by day and a professional opera singer by night. He then set up Opera Circus, a company that combines opera, circus, and theatre, and presented a music series called ‘The Score’ on BBC2. He thought he’d always belong in the world of art. But an unexpected call from one of the largest professional services companies in the world drew him towards the world of business. Now he works on bridging the two worlds, living in the “smudge” in between. “I don’t think I’m a performer or a business person, I really am hybrid. I’m both, I feel very comfortable in both areas. I’m clearly not a hard-nut businessman and I’m not a crazy art person, like most of us I live in the smudge,” he said. “I live in the sort of grey area in the middle of it, green, I don’t know, whatever it is.” The Theatre of Business The company that phoned, which he insists can’t be named, asked for David’s help because they wanted to bring the arts into the way they made relationships, solved problems, and did business. His solution was to build a skeleton theatre on a clifftop in Portugal, to have 1,500 of the staff come together, and to ask them to create an opera performance. He started to bring his theatrical experience to businesses. Related Coverage The Art of Networking and Coffee Chats Sceptics might question whether it would really work. The key is to work on things over time, he said, and the advantage of an individual event is that it gives people an experience that they can refer back to. “Will one event change their performance? No. But is it an example of people’s collaboration? Yes it is. People say we can’t collaborate – well, yes you did,” he said. “To the sceptics I would say don’t just measure time, keep looking and listening; in 6 months time there might be changes.” His creative streak has certainly got people thinking differently; he has since organised over 800 events for different organisations. David sees a synergy between theatre, life, and business. “Characters in drama all have a ‘why’ underneath their actions,” he said. “I found that most people have a why if they think long enough … And the people for me who seem to do best and be happiest are the people who know their why.” David Pearl sings during a presentation. (David Pearl) He used to hide his musical side in business meetings, but now he uses it to his advantage. “I’ll often sing in the boardroom, I just launch into song. Not for shock value but sometimes it’s easier – one song can say what 1,000 PowerPoint presentations would never do. If the room is going dead, I might just sing to them to re-energise them to shock them awake. “Or if there are people who are thinking about engaging with people or connecting with the customer, I sing them a love song to remind them that music and the arts have an incredible amount of technology to help you connect with audiences.” Of course, music isn’t just about connecting businesses to their audiences. It’s how he met his wife 24 years ago, serenading her under her window. They are now settled only a couple of streets away from where they first met, with their two children Elsa, 17 and Zachary, 15. Aside from writing books – most recently “Story for Leaders” – he runs Impropra, an improv opera company, and a not-for-profit venture called Street Wisdom. That’s a lot of projects going on at once. “I like the contrast of the different lives I’m leading. It keeps me energised,” he said. “Instead of thinking there’s one day and you’re yourself from the beginning to end, I like to think there’s one day and there’s probably five or six mes, each doing a bit of it. Then, I think I’m less tired at the end of the day. “I’m living a few lives at once, like a rockstar business life.” Take a Walk The moment in the bus, where David suddenly found inspiration in the ordinary, was one of the catalysts behind the social enterprise Street Wisdom, the third project he runs. The workshops that are free and are run globally “give participants the skills to access the ‘invisible university’ that’s all around them and find fresh answers to personal or work-related questions – with profound results,” the website explains. David Pearl leads a group of Street Wisdom workshop participants. (David Pearl) Though it sounds mystical, through a Street Wisdom taster session I found myself appreciating the small things on the street that I would not have otherwise appreciated, a beauty in the mundane. Being aware of the environment, rather than busily rushing from A to B, opened my mind. “What we do in Street Wisdom is mindfully wander,” said David. “There’s wisdom in the wandering. You’ll find things that you wouldn’t do otherwise.” Many people who have come on the workshop have had life-changing experiences, finding answers in the environment around them. “You don’t have to go on holiday to have a new thought,” he said. Mostly it’s about slowing down. It’s also designed to get business people out of the office and to think differently. “For a while I’ve started taking businesses out of their offices, I noticed there’s a difference when you’re out of the office – ah, I’m a human – sort of thing,” he said. “You also don’t have an identity. It doesn’t matter if you’re standing in a queue in a post office or you are sitting in a cafe, no one knows or cares if you are head of blah blah, or Chief Financial Officer of a bank, you’re just a person.” So next time you’re stuck in public transport on your daily commute, a little mindful wandering might just get you on your way.

Zhongguancun is a technology hub situated in the Haidian District in northwestern Beijing and is very well known in China. Often referred to as "China's Silicon Valley", the area has gathered nearly 20,000 technology enterprises since its emergence in the 1950s. The hub has many local prestigious academy affiliations, and is home to research centers for several global tech companies, including Google, Intel, AMD, Sony, and Microsoft. Zhongguancun main street and plaza in northwestern Beijing, China.. Apple's new R&D center in Zhongguancun has reportedly registered a capital of $15 million, with total investment likely to reach $45 million in the future, according to the park's press release. The center will employ a total of 500 staff and focus on the development of "computer software and hardware products, communication, audio and video devices, as well as advanced technologies for consumer electronics products and the information industry". The R&D facility is expected to complete in 2016 and to be used to integrate Apple's engineering and business teams to increase regional sales and services, according to media reports in China. The news comes on the heels of Apple CEO Tim Cook's announcement last month during a visit to China that an R&D center would be coming to the country "by the end of the year". The move has been seen as a response to the iPhone's dwindling returns in the country as consumers opt for low-cost alternatives available on the Chinese market. Apple has also experienced a series of setbacks in the region this year, including the closure of the iTunes and iBooks store and a number of lawsuits that have prevented it from being able to focus on gaining traction in the country's lucrative mobile segment. Although once Apple's second largest market in the world, the company announced during July's earnings report that its revenue in China had dropped 33 percent year-over-year. Apple has set up similar R&D centers in Japan, Israel, and the UK, and is said to be planning similar facilities in Canada, India, Indonesia and Vietnam to take advantage of local resources.

No, they're doomed. I saw it somewhere. [doublepost=1475148707][/doublepost] I didn't think I'd see the day Apple needs a multimillion dollar investment to relearn what Steve already knew...stop trying to shake down your customers for profit on a $9 dongle and instead build an insanely great product that truly is the best that you can make with the technology available so that customers will see the value for their hard earned money. They did, the customers are, and the dongle was free in the box. Rating: 4 Votes GrumpyMom 7 weeks ago And Apple is going to face the very same Chinese competition here on its home turf as the Chinese start stepping up offerings with display technologies and specs that rival those of Apple for half the cost, such as the Honor 8 phone does.

Don't get me wrong, I am not stupid. I understand international business sufficiently to understand and agree that Apple needs to establish substantial presence in the countries to which it sells its products. I'm just saying there is a reason that's not hard to figure out about its declining sales in China. Rating: 4 Votes GrumpyMom 7 weeks ago No, they're doomed. I saw it somewhere. [doublepost=1475148707][/doublepost] They did, the customers are, and the dongle was free in the box. Yeah but we have to buy more dongles for all our headphones if we don't want to carry the single one around or lose it when we take it off to use our headphones with our stereos or computers. Besides, dongles was just a throwaway example of the many ways Apple sneaks out a bit of profit here and there. I don't hate Apple, goodness no or I wouldn't be here and I wouldn't be planning out future purchases from them. I'm just giving them a bit of a o_O look at some of the things I think run contrary to the focus on the customer experience that I was used to getting from them. [doublepost=1475159637][/doublepost] Apple uses such local employment bribes in place of lobbyists, to try to get tax breaks, permission for stores and services, hopefully better patent court results, etc. It worked in Ireland. Hasn't worked in India very much. Pretty unlikely to work in China. A $45 million investment is nothing. Still, if a side effect is more localized apps and features, it'll be a win for China users. I would imagine or hope that's all Apple expects to get out of this. Serious R&D will be pilfered so they would be wise to stick to endeavors that will benefit the local population in much the same way they were able to develop the capability for the IPhone to work with the Japanese card system. There are elements to Chinese culture and daily life that should not be left to guessing or assumptions or even visits. Heck, I'm half Asian and I get it wrong a lot when it comes to understanding the nuances of the various Asian cultures that make up my heritage. It is really challenging to mix perspectives from east and west and not screw something up. Apple needs to be there in the thick of this daily life to better serve their Chinese customers. I just wonder if the Chinese government will foil them at every turn there. I do question how Tim justifies to himself as a human being all the butt kissing he has to do in order to conduct business in a country that has so many government sanctioned restrictions on gay rights as well as other human rights violations like enforced abortions listed in the other post on this thread.

I hope the China office is airgapped from the rest of Apple. Seriously. This could be a big problem if not handled correctly. Apple's already screwed. They've put all their eggs in one big authoritarian basket. The instant it's in China's interest to turn off the tap, they'll do it and then see how easy it'll be to get an iPhone Anything... Rating: 1 Votes rshrugged 7 weeks ago There's countless stories about trade secret thefts emanating from China, both by private parties and by the Nation-state. A federal grand jury has indicted six Chinese citizens in what authorities say was a long- running conspiracy to steal valuable technology from two U.S. firms for the benefit of the Chinese government. The indictment, unsealed Monday, highlights the threat posed by insiders who use their position to steal sensitive information on behalf of a foreign government or for financial gain. The move is part of a larger trend by the U.S. government to step up efforts to deter Chinese theft of trade secrets.[...] https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-indicts-6-chinese-on-charges-of-stealing-trade-secrets/2015/05/19/f11fd35e-fdd8-11e4-805c-c3f407e5a9e9_story.html Does Apple find the success of China's Great Firewall agreeable? It wasn't supposed to work. But China's Great Firewall -- a massive Internet surveillance and content control system -- has, in many respects, been an unparalleled success. China has Internet companies worth billions of dollars and more web users than the population of the United States -- all while still being able to block information it deems counter to its interests. And now, some fear, the model is going global. "If you are sitting in Beijing, what's the problem?" asks Bill Bishop, China watcher and author of the Sinocism China newsletter in the latest episode of "On China." "You are still in power, you have 650 million Internet users, you have billions of dollars of economic value going to the Internet everyday, you've used the Internet to increase government transparency, investors love us and they can't throw enough money at our companies that have more than half a trillion dollars in market capitalization," says Bishop.[...] http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/25/asia/china-internet-censorship-kristie-lu-stout/index.html Last year the Party did lift their one-child restriction policy. They now generously allow two. BEIJING — Driven by fears that an aging population could jeopardize China’s economic ascent, the Communist Party leadership ended its decades-old “one child” policy on Thursday, announcing that all married couples would be allowed to have two children.[...] For China’s leaders, the controls were a triumphant demonstration of the party’s capacity to reshape even the most intimate dimensions of citizens’ lives. But they bred intense resentment over the brutal intrusions involved, including forced abortions and crippling fines, especially in the countryside.[...] http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/world/asia/china-end-one-child-policy.html Does Apple find central control, as practiced in China, attractive? If they don't, they should rethink giving their tacit approval. Rating: 1 Votes kdarling 7 weeks ago Hiring like crazy and opening R&D centers all over the world. Apple is gearing up for (further) domination. Apple uses such local employment bribes in place of lobbyists, to try to get tax breaks, permission for stores and services, hopefully better patent court results, etc. It worked in Ireland. Hasn't worked in India very much. Pretty unlikely to work in China. A $45 million investment is nothing. Still, if a side effect is more localized apps and features, it'll be a win for China users. Rating: 1 Votes GrumpyMom 7 weeks ago Both China and India are nations where females are not just aborted, but many baby girls are abandoned or killed after birth. Indian Minister Says 2,000 Girls Are Killed Across the Country Every Day ('http://time.com/3830874/2000-girls-killed-every-day-india-minister/') Wow, I didn't know that. I know there is violence against women there but did not know that particular statistic. We have very good friends from India who have daughters (no sons) they adore and intend to educate in the best US schools in fields such as engineering and medicine. They are in fact sparing no expense to educate their daughters. They always paint India in a very progressive and idealistic light to my family. In fact, once their girls complete their education here, they all plan to return to India because they prefer it there, overall. They are not considered wealthy here but they are affluent enough. In India, they are apparently well to do and perhaps sheltered from the more brutal realities against females there, especially those of the lower castes. I don't know. It would be a delicate conversation to have with them, so I won't. In light of that gruesome statistic, it is rather incredible India has managed to have a female Prime Minister while the more progressive US has yet to elect a female president. It has always fascinated me to look around and see the numbers and influence of female leaders who manage to rise to prominence in some of the countries that are more restrictive if not downright brutal to women. I think the difference between China and India is that officials in India are working toward change. Clearly that female Minister is attempting to make things better for females. They are trying to eradicate brutality in India and it really persists on an institutional level due to corruption, not ideology. But in China, the brutality and oppression is instigated by the government itself. So I can see less ethical conflict about Apple moving into India to do business, but in the case of China which practically celebrates its oppression of people and in fact holds it up as an example to be exported, Apple has to concede a vast disconnect between Tim's stated commitment to social responsibility for Apple.

You don't "have to buy more dongles for all our headphones", hardly anyone is going to do that despite what you might do. All these posts about losing dongles and AirPods, are you guys really that aloof when it comes to your belongings? Do you lose things all the time? Like I said it's not about this one "dongle" per se, but about what it represents in terms of Apple making changes not for consumer benefit but to eke out more profit. There are numerous comments from forum members, tech reviewers and pundits in general about the logistical pain in the tail this move by Apple has engendered and their possible profit motive for initiating it.

 Car industry puts cooperation on show in battle against Silicon Valley firms Reuters Sep. 29, 2016, 5:34 AM 127 facebook linkedin twitter email print By Edward Taylor and Eric Auchard PARIS/FRANKFURT, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Alarmed by the threat posed by Silicon Valley firms to their businesses in developing autonomous driving systems, it was evident at the Paris Motor Show this week that carmakers are seeking to fightin back by cooperating in areas of technology development where previously they might have tried to compete. Three big carmakers - BMW, Daimler and VW's Audi - announced earlier this week they would launch new traffic monitoring services next year which give drivers a view of road conditions along their entire route, based on video data collected by their jointly-owned navigation mapping services firm, HERE from sensors incorporated in other cars (http://reut.rs/2dabC1B). Meanwhile HERE's Dutch rival TomTom NV, on Thursday announced traffic data deals for truckmaker Volvo and carmaker Skoda, a VW subsidiary. Connecting cars on the move with the Internet also needs more reliable mobile telecoms networks and towards that end Germany's top automakers said this week they were teaming up with the telecoms network equipment makers Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia, Qualcomm and Intel to help with developing the next-generation 5G networks set to debut around 2020 (http://reut.rs/2dcPuCy). It's unfamiliar territory for carmakers who are unaccustomed to cooperating as they battle for distinctive features that will help drive sales of their latest model vehicles. "This is how the automotive industry may be able to fight off the threat that Apple and particularly Google represent to their brands as digital services become more and more important," technology investment analyst Richard Windsor said. Moreover, carmakers are now racing one another to plot their paths to building self-driving vehicles over the next five years. That's a dramatic acceleration from the 10- to 15-year timeframes many had charted until pushed to speed up the process by the advances made by Google and Tesla. "We see the car transforming from a product into the ultimate platform," Daimler Chairman Dieter Zetsche said. Now General Motors, Nissan and VW are also experimenting with a plan to pull video data captured by their customers' vehicles using Israeli firm Mobileye's camera-based sensor systems, that may soon give automakers an edge over the likes of Google in the precision-mapping required for driverless cars (http://reut.rs/2daj3Wr). However, it remains to be seen whether carmakers can charge premium prices for connected car services as technology companies like Google look to develop similar offerings for free, supported by advertising or other business models. A deal by traffic data start-up Inrix to supply Google-owned crowd-sourced mapping unit Waze with its data will help drivers find parking spots on their smartphones via a free app. And on Thursday Renault said it was working with Waze on a Google Android Auto protoype for a navigation app that besides showing traffic conditions will also identify 13,000 electric car-charging stations across France. CAREFUL DRIVING Some in the industry are also cautioning that the move to developing fully autonomous driving should remain a very gradual one. Earlier this month pioneering electric car maker Tesla was accused by Mobileye of "pushing the envelope in terms of safety", alleging that it had promoted its Autopilot driver assistance system as "hands-free" (http://reut.rs/2d5lUiG). Other carmakers, while reluctant to address the dispute directly, are keen to emphasise that the move to developing truly autonomous vehicles remains a very gradual one. "There can be no compromise on safety, which is absolutely crucial - that is why at PSA we've always believed autonomy will happen in incremental steps," PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said in an interview published earlier this month. "This is not the case for certain competitors who have tried to produce a fully autonomous vehicle right away." Among car companies there are two camps: Those who are trying to develop their autonomous driving technology in-house, and those who are outsourcing it. Fiat's recent partnership to build self-driving vans with Google is seen by analysts as an example of outsourcing, given the Italian auto maker's weak finances, limiting its ability to invest in its own software expertise (http://reut.rs/1ZatE2c). Daimler, on the other hand, is firmly in the camp of those auto makers who want to go it alone. Some partnerships like the deal between Chinese carmaker Geely's Swedish subsidiary Volvo Car Group's deal to develop autonomous cars with Uber Technologies, and General Motor's partnership with Uber's rival Lyft, are seen as hybrid approaches to such cooperation. "The automotive industry has and will continue to become a software business in many ways," Audi of America President Scott Keogh told Reuters. "We are either capable of doing it in-house or we are going to all the partners that we need to go to, whether it's Nvidia , Mobileye or HERE."

"This is how the automotive industry may be able to fight off the threat that Apple and particularly Google represent to their brands as digital services become more and more important," technology investment analyst Richard Windsor said. BMW, Daimler and VW's Audi announced this week they would launch new traffic monitoring services next year which give drivers a view of road conditions miles ahead. They are based on video data collected from sensors in other cars and fed to the three carmakers' jointly-owned navigation mapping services firm HERE (http://reut.rs/2dabC1B). Separately HERE's Dutch rival TomTom NV on Thursday announced traffic data deals with truckmaker Volvo and carmaker Skoda, a VW subsidiary. Also General Motors, Nissan and VW are experimenting with a plan to pull video data captured by their customers' vehicles using Israeli firm Mobileye's camera-based sensor systems, that may soon give automakers an edge over the likes of Google in the precision-mapping required for driverless cars (http://reut.rs/2daj3Wr). However, it remains to be seen whether carmakers can charge premium prices for connected car services as technology companies like Google look to develop similar offerings for free, supported by advertising or other business models. A deal by traffic data start-up Inrix to supply data to Google-owned crowd-sourced traffic and navigation service Waze will help drivers find parking spots on smartphones using the free app. And Renault said on Thursday it was showing a prototype of a Waze system built into its car dashboards which run Android Auto, Google's operating system for carmakers. Meanwhile connecting cars on the move with the Internet also needs more reliable mobile telecoms networks. With that aim, Germany's top automakers said this week they were teaming up with telecoms network equipment makers Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia, Qualcomm and Intel to help with developing the next-generation 5G networks set to debut around 2020 (http://reut.rs/2dcPuCy). CAREFUL DRIVING At the same time carmakers are now racing to plot their courses to building self-driving vehicles over the next five years, a dramatic acceleration in pace from the 10- to 15-year timeframes many had charted until pushed to speed up the process by the advances made by Google and Tesla. "We see the car transforming from a product into the ultimate platform," Daimler Chairman Dieter Zetsche told reporters in Paris. Among the car companies there have been two camps, those who are trying to develop their autonomous driving technology in-house, and those who are outsourcing it, but that division is looking set to become less clear-cut due to the need for cooperation in some areas at least. "Gradually all of the car manufacturers will have to get more and more involved in managing data. It's natural. We're going to have to work much more collaboratively," Stewart Callegari, a Nissan product planning executive for driverless cars told reporters at the Paris show. Fiat's recent partnership to build self-driving vans with Google is seen by analysts as an example of outsourcing, given the Italian auto maker's weak finances, limiting its ability to invest in its own software expertise (http://reut.rs/1ZatE2c). Daimler, on the other hand, is firmly in the camp of vehicle makers who want to go it alone but still sees some need for collaboration. "We need to think whether we work together analysing the data or whether we do this on our own. This depends on the use case," Zetsche said, adding that it made sense to work together in areas where potential cost savings resulted but did not blur the distinctions between brands. Some partnerships like the deal between Chinese carmaker Geely's Swedish subsidiary Volvo Car Group to develop autonomous cars with Uber Technologies, and General Motor's partnership with Uber's rival Lyft, are also seen as hybrid approaches.

"This is how the automotive industry may be able to fight off the threat that Apple <AAPL.O> and particularly Google <GOOGL.O> represent to their brands as digital services become more and more important," technology investment analyst Richard Windsor said. BMW <BMWG.DE>, Daimler <DAIGn.DE> and VW's <VOWG_p.DE> Audi announced this week they would launch new traffic monitoring services next year which give drivers a view of road conditions miles ahead. They are based on video data collected from sensors in other cars and fed to the three carmakers' jointly-owned navigation mapping services firm HERE (http://reut.rs/2dabC1B). Separately HERE's Dutch rival TomTom NV <TOM2.AS> on Thursday announced traffic data deals with truckmaker Volvo <VOLVb.ST> and carmaker Skoda, a VW subsidiary. Also General Motors <GM.N>, Nissan <7201.T> and VW are experimenting with a plan to pull video data captured by their customers' vehicles using Israeli firm Mobileye's <MBLY.N> camera-based sensor systems, that may soon give automakers an edge over the likes of Google in the precision-mapping required for driverless cars (http://reut.rs/2daj3Wr). However, it remains to be seen whether carmakers can charge premium prices for connected car services as technology companies like Google look to develop similar offerings for free, supported by advertising or other business models. A deal by traffic data start-up Inrix to supply data to Google-owned crowd-sourced traffic and navigation service Waze will help drivers find parking spots on smartphones using the free app. And Renault <RENA.PA> said on Thursday it was showing a prototype of a Waze system built into its car dashboards which run Android Auto, Google's operating system for carmakers. Meanwhile connecting cars on the move with the Internet also needs more reliable mobile telecoms networks. With that aim, Germany's top automakers said this week they were teaming up with telecoms network equipment makers Ericsson <ERICb.ST>, Huawei [HWT.UL], Nokia <NOKIA.HE>, Qualcomm <QCOM.O> and Intel <INTC.O> to help with developing the next-generation 5G networks set to debut around 2020 (http://reut.rs/2dcPuCy). CAREFUL DRIVING At the same time carmakers are now racing to plot their courses to building self-driving vehicles over the next five years, a dramatic acceleration in pace from the 10- to 15-year timeframes many had charted until pushed to speed up the process by the advances made by Google and Tesla <TSLA.O>. "We see the car transforming from a product into the ultimate platform," Daimler Chairman Dieter Zetsche told reporters in Paris. Among the car companies there have been two camps, those who are trying to develop their autonomous driving technology in-house, and those who are outsourcing it, but that division is looking set to become less clear-cut due to the need for cooperation in some areas at least. "Gradually all of the car manufacturers will have to get more and more involved in managing data. It's natural. We're going to have to work much more collaboratively," Stewart Callegari, a Nissan product planning executive for driverless cars told reporters at the Paris show. Fiat's recent partnership to build self-driving vans with Google is seen by analysts as an example of outsourcing, given the Italian auto maker's weak finances, limiting its ability to invest in its own software expertise (http://reut.rs/1ZatE2c). Daimler, on the other hand, is firmly in the camp of vehicle makers who want to go it alone but still sees some need for collaboration. "We need to think whether we work together analyzing the data or whether we do this on our own. This depends on the use case," Zetsche said, adding that it made sense to work together in areas where potential cost savings resulted but did not blur the distinctions between brands. Some partnerships like the deal between Chinese carmaker Geely's <0175.HK> Swedish subsidiary Volvo Car Group to develop autonomous cars with Uber Technologies [UBER.UL], and General Motor's partnership with Uber's rival Lyft, are also seen as hybrid approaches. "The automotive industry has and will continue to become a software business in many ways," Audi of America President Scott Keogh told Reuters.

Three big carmakers – BMW, Daimler and VW’s Audi – announced earlier this week they would launch new traffic monitoring services next year which give drivers a view of road conditions along their entire route, based on video data collected by their jointly-owned navigation mapping services firm, HERE from sensors incorporated in other cars. Meanwhile HERE’s Dutch rival TomTom NV, on Thursday announced traffic data deals for truckmaker Volvo and carmaker Skoda, a VW subsidiary. Connecting cars on the move with the Internet also needs more reliable mobile telecoms networks and towards that end Germany’s top automakers said this week they were teaming up with the telecoms network equipment makers Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia, Qualcomm and Intel to help with developing the next-generation 5G networks set to debut around 2020. It’s unfamiliar territory for carmakers who are unaccustomed to cooperating as they battle for distinctive features that will help drive sales of their latest model vehicles. “This is how the automotive industry may be able to fight off the threat that Apple and particularly Google represent to their brands as digital services become more and more important,” technology investment analyst Richard Windsor said. Moreover, carmakers are now racing one another to plot their paths to building self-driving vehicles over the next five years. That’s a dramatic acceleration from the 10- to 15-year timeframes many had charted until pushed to speed up the process by the advances made by Google and Tesla. “We see the car transforming from a product into the ultimate platform,” Daimler Chairman Dieter Zetsche said. Now General Motors, Nissan and VW are also experimenting with a plan to pull video data captured by their customers’ vehicles using Israeli firm Mobileye’s camera-based sensor systems, that may soon give automakers an edge over the likes of Google in the precision-mapping required for driverless cars. However, it remains to be seen whether carmakers can charge premium prices for connected car services as technology companies like Google look to develop similar offerings for free, supported by advertising or other business models. A deal by traffic data start-up Inrix to supply Google-owned crowd-sourced mapping unit Waze with its data will help drivers find parking spots on their smartphones via a free app. And on Thursday Renault said it was working with Waze on a Google Android Auto protoype for a navigation app that besides showing traffic conditions will also identify 13,000 electric car-charging stations across France. CAREFUL DRIVING Some in the industry are also cautioning that the move to developing fully autonomous driving should remain a very gradual one. Earlier this month pioneering electric car maker Tesla was accused by Mobileye of “pushing the envelope in terms of safety”, alleging that it had promoted its Autopilot driver assistance system as “hands-free”. Other carmakers, while reluctant to address the dispute directly, are keen to emphasise that the move to developing truly autonomous vehicles remains a very gradual one. “There can be no compromise on safety, which is absolutely crucial – that is why at PSA we’ve always believed autonomy will happen in incremental steps,” PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said in an interview published earlier this month. “This is not the case for certain competitors who have tried to produce a fully autonomous vehicle right away.” Among car companies there are two camps: Those who are trying to develop their autonomous driving technology in-house, and those who are outsourcing it. Fiat’s recent partnership to build self-driving vans with Google is seen by analysts as an example of outsourcing, given the Italian auto maker’s weak finances, limiting its ability to invest in its own software expertise. Daimler, on the other hand, is firmly in the camp of those auto makers who want to go it alone. Some partnerships like the deal between Chinese carmaker Geely’s Swedish subsidiary Volvo Car Group’s deal to develop autonomous cars with Uber Technologies, and General Motor’s partnership with Uber’s rival Lyft, are seen as hybrid approaches to such cooperation. “The automotive industry has and will continue to become a software business in many ways,” Audi of America President Scott Keogh told Reuters. “We are either capable of doing it in-house or we are going to all the partners that we need to go to, whether it’s Nvidia , Mobileye or HERE.” Please Wait while comments are loading...

REUTERS/Jacky Naegelen 5/5 By Edward Taylor and Eric Auchard | PARIS/FRANKFURT PARIS/FRANKFURT Alarmed by the threat posed by Silicon Valley firms developing autonomous driving systems, carmakers at this week's Paris Motor Show showed signs they are ready to hit back by cooperating in areas where they might have been expected to compete. "This is how the automotive industry may be able to fight off the threat that Apple (AAPL.O) and particularly Google (GOOGL.O) represent to their brands as digital services become more and more important," technology investment analyst Richard Windsor said. BMW (BMWG.DE), Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and VW's (VOWG_p.DE) Audi announced this week they would launch new traffic monitoring services next year which give drivers a view of road conditions miles ahead. They are based on video data collected from sensors in other cars and fed to the three carmakers' jointly-owned navigation mapping services firm HERE (reut.rs/2dabC1B). Separately HERE's Dutch rival TomTom NV (TOM2.AS) on Thursday announced traffic data deals with truckmaker Volvo (VOLVb.ST) and carmaker Skoda, a VW subsidiary. Also General Motors (GM.N), Nissan (7201.T) and VW are experimenting with a plan to pull video data captured by their customers' vehicles using Israeli firm Mobileye's (MBLY.N) camera-based sensor systems, that may soon give automakers an edge over the likes of Google in the precision-mapping required for driverless cars (reut.rs/2daj3Wr). However, it remains to be seen whether carmakers can charge premium prices for connected car services as technology companies like Google look to develop similar offerings for free, supported by advertising or other business models. A deal by traffic data start-up Inrix to supply data to Google-owned crowd-sourced traffic and navigation service Waze will help drivers find parking spots on smartphones using the free app. And Renault (RENA.PA) said on Thursday it was showing a prototype of a Waze system built into its car dashboards which run Android Auto, Google's operating system for carmakers. Meanwhile connecting cars on the move with the Internet also needs more reliable mobile telecoms networks. With that aim, Germany's top automakers said this week they were teaming up with telecoms network equipment makers Ericsson (ERICb.ST), Huawei [HWT.UL], Nokia (NOKIA.HE), Qualcomm (QCOM.O) and Intel (INTC.O) to help with developing the next-generation 5G networks set to debut around 2020 (reut.rs/2dcPuCy). CAREFUL DRIVING At the same time carmakers are now racing to plot their courses to building self-driving vehicles over the next five years, a dramatic acceleration in pace from the 10- to 15-year timeframes many had charted until pushed to speed up the process by the advances made by Google and Tesla (TSLA.O). "We see the car transforming from a product into the ultimate platform," Daimler Chairman Dieter Zetsche told reporters in Paris. Among the car companies there have been two camps, those who are trying to develop their autonomous driving technology in-house, and those who are outsourcing it, but that division is looking set to become less clear-cut due to the need for cooperation in some areas at least. "Gradually all of the car manufacturers will have to get more and more involved in managing data. It's natural. We're going to have to work much more collaboratively," Stewart Callegari, a Nissan product planning executive for driverless cars told reporters at the Paris show. Fiat's recent partnership to build self-driving vans with Google is seen by analysts as an example of outsourcing, given the Italian auto maker's weak finances, limiting its ability to invest in its own software expertise (reut.rs/1ZatE2c). Daimler, on the other hand, is firmly in the camp of vehicle makers who want to go it alone but still sees some need for collaboration. "We need to think whether we work together analyzing the data or whether we do this on our own. This depends on the use case," Zetsche said, adding that it made sense to work together in areas where potential cost savings resulted but did not blur the distinctions between brands. Some partnerships like the deal between Chinese carmaker Geely's (0175.HK) Swedish subsidiary Volvo Car Group to develop autonomous cars with Uber Technologies [UBER.UL], and General Motor's partnership with Uber's rival Lyft, are also seen as hybrid approaches. "The automotive industry has and will continue to become a software business in many ways," Audi of America President Scott Keogh told Reuters.

Three big carmakers - BMW, Daimler and VW's Audi - announced earlier this week they would launch new traffic monitoring services next year which give drivers a view of road conditions along their entire route, based on video data collected by their jointly-owned navigation mapping services firm HERE from sensors incorporated in other cars (reut.rs/2dabC1B). Meanwhile HERE's Dutch rival TomTom NV, on Thursday announced traffic data deals for truckmaker Volvo and carmaker Skoda, a VW subsidiary. Connecting cars on the move with the Internet also needs more reliable mobile telecoms networks and towards that end Germany's top automakers said this week they were teaming up with the telecoms network equipment makers Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia, Qualcomm and Intel to help with developing the next-generation 5G networks set to debut around 2020 (reut.rs/2dcPuCy). It's unfamiliar territory for carmakers who are unaccustomed to cooperating as they battle for distinctive features that will help drive sales of their latest model vehicles. "This is how the automotive industry may be able to fight off the threat that Apple and particularly Google represent to their brands as digital services become more and more important," technology investment analyst Richard Windsor said. Moreover, carmakers are now racing one another to plot their paths to building self-driving vehicles over the next five years.

CAREFUL DRIVING Some in the industry are also warning that the move to developing fully autonomous driving should remain a very gradual one. Earlier this month pioneering electric car maker Tesla was accused by Mobileye of "pushing the envelope in terms of safety", alleging that it had promoted its Autopilot driver assistance system as "hands-free" (reut.rs/2d5lUiG). Other carmakers, while reluctant to address the dispute directly, are keen to emphasise the need for a cautious approach. "There can be no compromise on safety, which is absolutely crucial - that is why at PSA we've always believed autonomy will happen in incremental steps," PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said in an interview published earlier this month. "This is not the case for certain competitors who have tried to produce a fully autonomous vehicle right away."

Apple is expected to fully revamp their 13-inch and 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro, which should rock Intel's new Kaby Lake CPUs - making for thinner, lighter MacBook Pros.   Apple is expected to unveil their Touch ID fingerprint sensor onto the next-gen MacBook Pros, borrowing the security side of things from the iPhone and iPad. The fingerprint sensor would allow MacBook Pro owners to log-in to their laptops using their fingerprint, or they would allow for Apple Pay purchases with your fingerprint, which is now supported by macOS Sierra, and iOS 10.   The most exciting thing aside from the Kaby Lake processor and Touch ID sensor, is that the new MacBook Pros are rumored to feature an OLED touchbar above the function keys. The OLED display touchbar would allow people to tap the bar to access applications on their MacBook Pro, but I'm sure there'll be some magic and hopefully some courage built-in to the new MacBook Pro, too.

Enabling access layer bandwidth to evolve incrementally beyond 1 Gigabit per second (Gb/s), it will help address emerging needs in a variety of settings and applications, including enterprise, wireless networks, and more. "End user data needs – both wired and wireless – are continuing to grow, especially as more and more users access the network via ever-faster wireless technologies enabled by IEEE 802.11ac™. The 1000BASE-T uplink from the wireless to wired network is no longer sufficient, and users need a way to tap into higher data rates without having to overhaul the 70 billion meters of Cat5e / Cat6 wiring already sold," said David Chalupsky, board of directors, Ethernet Alliance; principal engineer, Intel Corporation; and chair of the IEEE 802.3bz task force. "IEEE 802.3bz is an elegant solution addressing not only the demand for faster access to rapidly rising data volumes, but also capitalizes on previous infrastructure investments, thereby extending their life and maximizing value." Building upon the success of and laying out an upgrade path for 1000BASE-T, IEEE 802.3bz defines 2.5 Gigabit (2.5G) and 5 Gigabit (5G) BASE-T Ethernet. It specifies Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) parameters, physical layer specifications (PHYs), and management objects for balanced twisted pair transmission media found in structured cabling. Facilitating up to five times the speed without requiring expensive infrastructure changes, IEEE 802.3bz enables cost-effective network bandwidth scaling. This enterprise technology addresses various needs, including scientific and research computing, content production and editing, industrial design and automation, machine vision, and more. "IEEE 802.3bz is a valuable addition to Ethernet's expanding family of standards; its deployment will enable the faster wireless connections promised by the next generation of wireless access," said John D'Ambrosia, chairman, Ethernet Alliance; and senior principal engineer, Huawei. "The Ethernet Alliance is excited by the promise and opportunities presented by IEEE 802.3bz. We are committed to validating the industry's expectation of the multi-vendor interoperability of this standard as the follow-on to 1000BASE-T, considered the most successful Ethernet project ever."

The Ethernet Alliance takes Ethernet standards to market by supporting activities that span from incubation of new Ethernet technologies to interoperability demonstrations and education.

Yup, we’ve all been there, and now it seems that during the 10th annual McAfee Most Dangerous Celebrities study, Intel Security has found actress/comedian Amy Schumer to be the most dangerous celebrity to search for. What do we mean by that? Basically one of the ways hackers trick people into installing malware on their computers is to hijack the search results for celebrities, basically those shady links we were talking about. For users who do not know better, they might click that link and end up having malware or a virus installed on their computer. At this time of writing, Amy Schumer has topped the list with 16.11%, meaning that there’s a 16.11% chance that the search results could lead users to a site with malware. Coming in second place is Justin Bieber at 15%, Carson Daly and Will Smith who are both tied 13.44%, Rihanna at 13.33%, Miley Cyrus at 12.67%, Chris Hardwick at 12.56%, Daniel Tosh at 11.56%, and Selena Gomez tied with Ke$ha at 11.11%. Like we said, if you know what you’re doing then chances are you know which sites sound shady enough to avoid, but if you want to be safe, we suppose keeping your anti-virus software up to date with the latest threats is always a good idea.

According to an unnamed Samsung official quoted by a South Korean newspaper, Huawei is in the process of developing a new smartwatch, but one that doesn’t run Android Wear. Instead, the Chinese company is said to be working together with Samsung in order to get the Tizen operating system up and running on the wearable device. With Android Wear smartwatches seemingly at a plateau, this win for Tizen could mean a more difficult struggle for Google’s wearable platform. To be clear, and despite appearances, Samsung doesn’t own Tizen and neither is it the only company working on it. In fact, Huawei is one of the first members of the Tizen Association, which also includes the likes of Intel, LG, and Panasonic, just to name some. Of these, however, Samsung remains Tizen’s biggest champion, putting the operating system in TVs, fitness bands, smartwatches, and even smartphones. As to why Huawei would be considering switching sides as far as its smartwatches are concerned, the report cites the Samsung exec as saying that Google has been uncooperative helping Huawei customize the Android Wear interface and experience. Unlike Android on smartphones and tablets, Android Wear has more or less been standardized across different smartwatches, leaving smartwatch makers to compete on smartwatch design primarily. In contrast, Samsung has had positive results with Tizen, which it has custom fit for the Gear S2 and S3 to accommodate its rotary bezel control. LG had a similar approach with its own webOS-based Watch Urbane, but eventually went back to the Android Wear fold in later iterations. Huawei may be planning to do likewise but is impeded by Google’s tighter control on Android Wear. Or at least that’s what the report implies. That said, Tizen does face other, equally substantial deficiencies, particularly in apps. Google has made it almost too easy for Android app developers to create equivalent Android Wear apps by practically using the same platform. For Tizen smartwatch apps, however, they will need to learn a different software stack. The growing popularity of Samsung’s Gear S2 and Gear S3 smartwatches, however, could provide an opportunity for the OS as Android Wear seemingly gets stuck in stagnation.

Microsoft Surface Book and Pro 4 Tablets Receive August 30, 2016 Update The new release improves on-screen keyboard stability Sep 29, 2016 06:18 GMT  ·  By Iulian Pascal  ·  Share:  Microsoft has rolled out a new cumulative firmware and driver update package targeted at its Surface Book and Pro 4 tablets, namely version August 30, 2016, which installs Surface Integration Service Device Version 1.0.146.0 to ensure the Balanced power plan is set correctly when the OS is updated. In addition to that, the present update applies the 11.0.15.1003 Surface Management Engine, as well as a new Surface UEFI version, to increase stability and performance when shifting power states. Moreover, tablets will also receive improved usability and battery life, enhanced touch stability when resuming from sleep/hibernations (Intel Precise Touch Device 1.1.0.246), as well as optimized pen pairing. When it comes to installation, know that this task can be carried out either automatically via Microsoft’s Windows Update service or manually by downloading and installing the package. If the first method is desired, take into account that not all Surface owners will receive this new firmware at the same time, and you might need to wait for this release to reach your tablet. As for the other method, simply save, extract, and install all files on your device. However, do not forget that the present firmware is only targeted at the Surface units mentioned above. Also, it would be a good idea to reboot your device manually (if not requested automatically), to ensure all changes take effect properly.

Other players like ebay India, Shopclues are also going to offer discounts during the sale period. This is a good time to browse for prices, specifications of laptops, desktops, smartphones and read up on reviews of which products are good.  Our suggestion is also to check the current prices of the products, and then see which ones get an actual discount on sale dates. It’s also best to keep signed in with address, payment details etc on the website of your choice, because sale days also means a lot of failure when it comes to checking out. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaBanks to work normal hours on Saturday, but only senior citizens can exchange old notes BusinessDemonetisation: Execution could not have been better, says Arun Jaitley IndiaDemonetisation: Misuse of bank account for black money deposit to invite govt action IndiaLong queues outside banks a ‘serious issue’, says SC on demonetisation IndiaPriyanka Gandhi to play 'major role' in UP Assembly polls: Congress EntertainmentForce 2 movie review: John Abraham, Sonakshi Sinha film is Bond-Bourne rehash EntertainmentChris Martin parties with Shah Rukh Khan, Sussanne Khan and Sridevi's daughters, see inside pics EntertainmentIt's November 18, Salman Khan's wedding day, see pics EntertainmentIulia Vantur reveals what she had to sacrifice to live in India.

The Hypercat Australia group recently launched its efforts as a counterpart to the UK-based alliance pushing the Hypercat standard. This comes against the backdrop of competing standards vying for dominance in the relatively new field of IoT. Hypercat Australia supporters include KPMG Australia, Flexeye, Giant Ideas and the University of Technology Sydney. “It’s early days given the launch yesterday was the initial call for local membership, but in less than 24 hours we have received more than 40 registrations of interest for membership of Hypercat Australia,” said KPMG Australia’s IoT point man Piers Hogarth-Scott. Meanwhile, the standard is supported globally by such industry giants as Intel, IBM, Huawei, Cisco, ARM, Broadcom and Fujitsu. “The goal of Hypercat is to accelerate the global explosion of the Internet of Things – by enabling connected devices and data to work together to improve how cities work, and how people live,” said Justin Anderson, founder of the Hypercat Alliance. The open JSON-based Hypercat standard is used for exposing IoT device information via the Internet. “The Commonwealth is exploring relationships with different jurisdictions to build smart cities that improve our lives,” added Angus Taylor, Australia’s assistant minister for cities and digital transformation.  “Hypercat Australia is one such partnership which will allow a platform to facilitate cutting edge technology solutions to be applied to urban problems.” Taylor was on hand for the launch event of Hypercat Australia. Aussie smart city efforts key to renewal Last month he announced that the Australian government’s $50 million Smart Cities and Suburbs Program would stage a series of stakeholder roundtables. The first of these roundtables is set to take place in Melbourne on September 14. This follows the April publication of the government’s Smart Cities plan which cited “Smart Technology” as one of its three main pillars. The document promoted the approach of infrastructure renewal through the lens of such emerging technology as IoT. “The Australian Government has strengthened its assessment of infrastructure projects and now examines the extent to which new technologies are used to improve the efficiency, sustainability and services of infrastructure networks,” it said.

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics engineers (IEEE) has finalised the 802.3bz standard, which defines 2.5Gbps and 5Gbps ‘BASE-T Ethernet’. It is claimed the standard will allow businesses to reuse up to 70 billion metres of Ethernet cabling, making it an achievable and cost-effective upgrade. Faster Ethernet “End user data needs – both wired and wireless – are continuing to grow, especially as more and more users access the network via ever-faster wireless technologies enabled by IEEE 802.11ac,” said David Chalupsky, principal engineer at Intel and chair of the IEEE 802.3bz task force. “The 1000BASE-T uplink from the wireless to wired network is no longer sufficient, and users need a way to tap into higher data rates without having to overhaul the 70 billion metres of Cat5e / Cat6 wiring already sold. “IEEE 802.3bz is an elegant solution addressing not only the demand for faster access to rapidly rising data volumes, but also capitalizes on previous infrastructure investments, thereby extending their life and maximising value.” The need for faster Ethernet to support wireless demand has long been recognised by the industry, with Cisco among the vendors which formed the NBASE-T Alliance in 2014 with the intention of creating multi-gigabit networks. The adoption of speedier 802.11ac Wi-Fi is a reaction to growing demand from mobile devices on corporate networks. But the full potential of the technology cannot be realised if wired infrastructure does not evolve too. Separate initiatives are underway to increase the amount of bandwidth going into data centres. Industry body the Ethernet Alliance claims the new standard will address needs in scientific and research computing, content production and editing, industrial design and automation, machine vision, as well as the need for faster wireless networking. “IEEE 802.3bz is a valuable addition to Ethernet’s expanding family of standards; its deployment will enable the faster wireless connections promised by the next generation of wireless access,” added John D’Ambrosia, chairman, Ethernet Alliance and senior principal engineer at Huawei.

These 3 Stocks Tripled in 12 Months The Motley Fool 9/28/2016 Dan Caplinger © Provided by Fool Tck Mining The stock market has done well over the past year, with most major market benchmarks producing returns in the 10% to 15% range since September 2015. The Dow and S&P 500 hit new record levels during the summer months, and although volatility has returned to the markets, investors seem reasonably comfortable with the prospects for stocks going forward. Yet even the solid returns from the overall market pale in comparison to what a few select stocks have managed to produce. Quotes in the article Teck Resources Ltd TCK ▼ 22.57 -0.75 -3.22% Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD ▲ 8.73 +0.27 +3.19% Tobira Therapeutics Inc TBRA = 42.09 0.00 0.00% Allergan PLC AGN ▼ 195.98 -4.01 -2.00% Below, we'll take a closer look at three stocks that have tripled since this time last year to see if investors can squeeze any more gains out of them.© Provided by Fool TCK Chart TCK data by YCharts. Teck Resources gets its momentum back The commodities markets have finally started to move back in the right direction, and Teck Resources (TCK) has been a primary beneficiary of that trend reversal. The company produces certain amounts of precious metals such as gold and silver, both of which have jumped sharply over the past year. Yet Teck is better known for its other mined products, including copper, zinc, molybdenum, and metallurgical coal. Better prospects for those markets have helped send Teck up 279% in the past 12 months. The Canadian mining company has done a good job of cutting costs in its operations, working to make itself as efficient as possible to weather the downturn in commodity prices. Refinancing its debt allowed Teck to take advantage of low interest rates, buying itself a couple extra years to hope for a more extensive turn higher in sales. In addition, a new investment in an oil sands project could bring further diversification to Teck, and it could prove well-timed if oil can rebound from its recent slump. Overall, investors are hopeful that Teck has turned the corner, and continued favorable moves in commodities could send the stock still higher. Will AMD serve up some tasty chips? Semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has been extremely volatile in its history, producing lackluster long-term performance that reflects its secondary status in many of the markets that it addresses. Playing second fiddle to Intel in the PC chip space for decades, AMD has made more inroads in the graphics chip market -- but even there, it faces competitive challenges. Over the past year, though, Advanced Micro has taken strides to become more competitive, and that has helped send its stock up 277% since September 2015. Its launch of its new Polaris graphics chip architecture has given AMD a viable position in the GPU space, and investors have increasingly high hopes that its pipeline of future chips using 14-nanometer transistor sizes can match up to those that its rivals produce. At the same time, AMD posted an adjusted operating profit in its most recent quarter, reaching what CEO Lisa Su called "a significant milestone" for the company. Takeover speculation has also pushed Advanced Micro shares higher. Overall, AMD's gains assume that the tech company will live up to its full potential, so anything short of that could cause shares to lose much of the ground they've gained. Tobira gets a big buyout The most common way for stocks to jump is through buyouts, and that's what Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA) shareholders enjoyed recently. After suffering through a long period in which its stock price got cut in half, Tobira received a buyout offer from Allergan (AGN) that sent the biotech up by more than 700% in a single day. That brought its overall 12-month return to 218%. Tobira is looking at potential treatments for the liver disease non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, which Allergan has identified as an area of interest for the larger biotech company. Yet the failure of Tobira drug cenicriviroc to meet its primary endpoint in a phase 2 clinical trial during the summer led to a big loss for the stock, and few investors were confident that phase 3 trials of the drug would produce any better results. Allergan thought differently, though, and was willing to offer a combination of cash and contingent value rights that could be worth as much as $1.7 billion. Those rights could produce some additional return in the long run if the drug meets specified milestones, but Tobira has already generated most of the value it can for shareholders. Stocks that triple are exceedingly rare, and often, what sends them to their new heights doesn't lend itself to repeating. Tobira has almost no chance of moving any higher than it currently is, but Teck has the better prospects to add to gains if its target market keeps behaving well in the months and years to come.

These are the 10 most dangerous celebrity names to search for on Google Jethro Nededog Sep. 28, 2016, 1:14 PM 130,323 facebook linkedin twitter email print Comedy Central/"Inside Amy Schumer" Amy Schumer's year of being Hollywood's "it girl" can now include the honor of "most dangerous" celebrity to search for on the internet. Intel Security just released its annual Most Dangerous Celebrities study. Aside from including some interesting tidbits about the current culture of internet security and those who aim to thwart it, it also lists the celebrity names that are most likely to expose computers to viruses and malware if a person searches for them on the internet. Malware publishers often set up websites with celebrity pictures and information on them to entice unsuspecting fans, and those sites can then be used to steal passwords and personal information.  According to the study, the most dangerous types of internet searches of entertainers are those for comedians, musicians, late-night television hosts, and the strangely specific category of "The Voice" coaches. This year, Schumer bumped Armin van Buuren, an electronic dance music DJ, from the top spot on the list. In fact, he didn't even make it on this year's list.

From tourism to big data, Guizhou Province in southwestern China has presented itself as a tourism destination as well as an information technology pilot for the world to see. (Xinhua/Xu Yong) SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 28 (Xinhua) -- From tourism to big data, Guizhou Province in southwestern China has presented itself as a tourism destination as well as an information technology pilot for the world to see. Mr. Chen Gang, deputy director of a task force directing the national big data pilot project in Guizhou, a mountainous province known for its scenic landscape and ethnic diversity, has spent almost a week on the U.S. west coast to talk about what is going on with his province. On Monday, Chen led a provincial delegation to Santa Clara, at center of Silicon Valley in northern California, to promote a big data pilot zone in Guizhou, the only one receiving designation and funding from China's central government to build big data infrastructure, experiment on internet of things (IoT) and cloud computation, and other applications. On Tuesday, he was in downtown San Francisco, north of Silicon Valley, to showcase Guizhou's tourism resources. With a doctoral degree in chemistry and a top leadership position within government institutions at Guiyang, the provincial capital, Chen did not see tourism and big data as two industries far from each other. At the Santa Clara event, he cited city management as an area where big data has a role. For instance, data mining helps Guiyang municipal authorities to see where passengers, both local residents and tourists from outside the city, need short rides to go from one place to another. The city, already overloaded with private cars, therefore is able to improve taxi services and car-sharing practices while cracking down on unlicensed cabs. He told more than 150 people at the event, including some from businesses in Silicon Valley, that multinational American companies such as Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Intel, Qualcomm, Dell, International Business Machine (IBM) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) have joined Baidu, Alibaba, Huawei, ZTE, China Telecom, China Mobile, China Unicom and other leading Chinese information technology companies to operate research and development (R&D) centers or projects in Guizhou. Baidu, an internet company headquartered in Beijing, the Chinese capital, has explored the possibility of road testing its self-driving vehicles in the province, once hard to reach with any transportation means for centuries but now proud to have a web of highways and local roadways through mountainous terrains reaching every county and city seats and rural villages. The mountain park province, as Chen called it, is boasting the world's largest water fall, arguably one of the world's oldest military fortress and the world's largest botanic garden, plus mountains, canyons, karst caves, forests, grassland, wetland and lakes, 3 of them on the list of world heritage sites recognized by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). As colorful as the natural scenes are the people living on the territory, Chen noted at the San Francisco event attended by state and city officials and tourism industry representatives, adding that 17 ethnic hill tribes are there in Guizhou to show their rich and diversified and strikingly beautiful heritages, from clothing to music and dance, from construction structures of their residence to festive rituals. Tourists to Guizhou saw a 40 percent increase last year, he said. At both events, Chen showed pictures of a new structure, a radio telescope known as the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope, or FAST, the world's largest and most sensitive of the kind, inaugurated in Guiping county, Guizhou, on Sunday, Sept. 25. Built with a 4,450-panel reflector as large as 30 football pitches to survey neutral hydrogen in deep space, observe celestial objects called pulsars, help with spacecraft tracking and communication, FAST is expected to help search for extraterrestrial intelligent life, or ET, possibly existing somewhere in the universe. Chen said FAST is a new must see for visitors to his province. Previously a top administrator in a district of Beijing before being reassigned to Guizhou about three years ago, the official did not consider switching the topics from tourism to big data as a frog leap. He believes both industries can work on a eco-friendly development strategy for a province relatively less industrial and yet having huge economic potentials. However, Min Song, a Chinese-American presiding over local U.S.-China Cultural and Communication Association, who helped organize the big data promotion event, was amazed. He visited Guizhou once on a business trip some 20 years ago, when it was one of the least developed provinces in China, said he never thought about the province would be turned into a high technology host of any kind. "You are all welcome to tour Guizhou," Chen told his audiences.    1 2 >>      1 2 >>   [Editor: huaxia] Xinhua Weibo Facebook Twitter Reddit Diigo Delicious Digg Linkedin MySpace Sina Weibo Kaixin Renren Q-zone Tencent Weibo Sohu Weibo NetEase Weibo Copyright © 2000 - 2016 XINHUANET.com All Rights Reserved.   From tourism to big data, Chinese province presents itself in Silicon Valley                Xinhua Weibo Facebook Twitter Reddit Diigo Delicious Digg Linkedin MySpace Sina Weibo Kaixin Renren Q-zone Tencent Weibo Sohu Weibo NetEase Weibo   Source: Xinhua | 2016-09-29 01:25:10 | Editor: huaxia   Photo taken on Sept. 27, 2016 shows the scene of an event to promote tourism in China's Guizhou Province, held in San Francisco, the United States.

Resend activation e-mail Scientific Method / Science & Exploration Memristor that forgets makes a good model neuron New device mimics how neurons alter behavior once they're activated. by John Timmer - Sep 28, 2016 10:45 pm UTC Login to bookmark 37 Memristor characterization silicon at Hewlett Packard Labs. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise While the human brain isn't particularly quick at handling complex calculations, it performs a variety of tasks, such as image analysis, far more accurately than any computer. And, when it comes to energy efficiency, a brain beats a traditional computer with ease. Which is why it's somewhat ironic that all the original attempts to model a brain were forced to use software running on traditional computers, since that was all we had. Recently, however, there have been a variety of attempts to build hardware that acts more like a collection of neurons than anything that Apple or Intel have designed. While some of that uses traditional silicon-based transistors, other efforts have explored a relatively newer development, the memristor. Now, an international collaboration that includes everyone from Hewlett Packard Enterprise to the Air Force has designed a memristor that behaves a bit more like a neuron: its recent activity influences how it responds. This is accomplished by allowing metal to diffuse within the solid memristor. The idea behind the new design was apparently inspired by our understanding of neurons. In many cases, the activity of a neuron isn't only set by the signals it's receiving right at that instant. Instead, it has the biochemical equivalent of short-term memory. If it's received signals in the recent past, it's easier to activate that neuron by an additional signal. Over time, that memory fades, and the neuron goes back to its normal level of responsiveness. Now, it's undoubtedly possible to provide an artificial neuron with a small bit of memory and circuitry to read it, all of which could provide similar behavior. But this team managed to do it using just a single memristor. The secret was a clever bit of materials science. A memristor is a device with two states that it can be switched between. In one, it provides high resistance to current traveling through it; in the alternate state, it allows current to pass more freely. In this case, the authors fabricated a memristor using a silicon-oxygen-nitrogen material (the precise composition varied, and they also tested a hafnium oxide). To carry the current in the "on" state, they embedded some silver nanoparticles. This led to the sort of behavior you'd expect from a memristor. When sufficient current was applied to the device, the heat generated by its resistance allowed the silver to diffuse within the solid, forming small "wires" that connected the two ends, allowing current to pass easily. The intriguing thing is what happens once the current is switched off. Normally, you'd expect that things would stay in the low-resistance state. But something called (and I am not making this up) Ostwald ripening occurs. When there's a bunch of small particles embedded in a solid, the energetics of that depends on how compatible the two materials are. If they're not very compatible, it becomes energetically favorable to minimize the contact between them. That means fewer, larger particles. And, because solids can (to a limited extent) diffuse within each other, that's exactly what happens. Smaller particles shrink out of existence, as their component atoms diffuse over and join larger ones. For this memristor, this is precisely what happens to the silver. Instead of remaining in longer, wire-like structures, it quickly condenses back to a small collection of larger particles through Ostwald ripening (why yes, I will use that term as often as I possibly can). This has a very specific effect on the device. If signals in the form of current have transited it within the last few seconds, it'll still be in the "on" state, and the current will travel with low resistance. Longer than that, however, and Ostwald ripening ensures that it goes back to the off state, meaning that any additional signals face high resistance. This also sets an activity threshold for the memristor, as it has to receive more than one signal in quick succession before it will become active—again, a bit like a neuron. The authors of the paper describing this device spend a lot of time arguing that this behavior specifically mimics how neurons handle the calcium they use to help trigger activity. That's probably overstating it, as neurons are quite a bit more complex than a single electronic device. Still, there's no question that this device acts a lot more like a neuron than most typical circuitry does. And the authors have managed to make them using a variety of materials, so it's apparently robust behavior. Whether this will end up useful enough to end up in a neural computer isn't clear at this point. But I'm always enthused at having more potential tools available to anyone who's trying to assemble something like that. It's impossible to know in advance which combination of hardware approaches is eventually going to prove compelling. Nature Materials, 2016. DOI: 10.1038/NMAT4756  (About DOIs).

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)More Over the past month, voter registration databases in states across the United States have continued to come under attack by hackers, FBI Director James Comey warned lawmakers today. "There have been a variety of scanning activities, which is a preamble for potential intrusion activities, as well as some attempted intrusions at voter registration databases beyond those we knew about in July and August," he told the House Judiciary Committee. "There's no doubt that some bad actors have been poking around." Comey did not say whether those hacking attempts were on behalf of any foreign government, but his comments came amid increasing concern over suspected Russian attempts to break into U.S. political institutions and influence the upcoming presidential election. In August, the FBI issued a warning to state governments noting that hackers infiltrated the Illinois State Board of Elections two months earlier and then tried to breach election systems in Arizona. Sources have told ABC News that Russian hackers were likely behind the cyberattacks. Speaking to lawmakers today, Comey said the FBI is trying to figure out "just what mischief is Russia up to in connection with our election." Top Intel Official Tells Americans to End 'Hyperventilation' Over DNC Hack but Calls Breach Potentially 'Serious' He emphasized that voter registration databases — not the voting system itself — are being targeted by hackers. "This is very different than the vote system in the United States, which is very, very hard for someone to hack into because it's so clunky and dispersed," Comey said, adding that states should be in contact with the Department of Homeland Security and "make sure that their deadbolts are thrown and their locks are on." He added, "That is work that goes on all day, every day." During a separate House hearing, a top Department of Homeland Security official, the head of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, and the secretary of state of Georgia all said a cyberattack could not change the outcome of the 2016 election. A cyber-expert from New York University agreed, calling it unlikely, but a Princeton University professor described it as possible. Dr. Andy Ozment, the assistant secretary for cybersecurity and communications at DHS, said hackers who broke into the voter registration system in Illinois and targeted a similar system in Arizona appear to have been looking to copy the personal information in those databases and perhaps then sell that information online. The aim was apparently not to affect the election process, he said. "We have not seen intrusions intended to in any way impact individuals' votes and actual voting," Ozment said. For months, the FBI has been investigating what appear to be coordinated cyberattacks on Democratic organizations -- the most damaging so far being the hack of the Democratic National Committee. Not only did the hack apparently allow cyberoperatives to steal opposition research on Republican nominee Donald Trump, but many suspect it also led to the theft of internal messages that appeared to show efforts by DNC officials to undermine Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders during the primary season. After those damaging emails were publicly released by WikiLeaks, Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz stepped down as the DNC's chairwoman. Many suspect Russian hackers are also to blame for these cyberassaults on Democratic organizations. In late June an "unknown actor scanned a state's Board of Election website for vulnerabilities" and, after identifying a security gap, exploited the vulnerability to conduct a "data exfiltration," or unauthorized data transfer, the FBI said in a recent bulletin. Then in August, hackers used the same vulnerability in an "attempted intrusion activities into another state's Board of Election system," the FBI said. "The prospect of a hostile government actively seeking to undermine our free and fair elections represents one of the gravest threats to our democracy since the Cold War," Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., wrote in a recent letter to Comey.

The pact is another example of Germany's premium carmakers collaborating to build technology expertise necessary to take on new rivals like Uber and Google which are also working on autonomous driving technology. The new alliance, branded the 5G Automotive Association, will "develop, test and promote communications solutions, support standardisation and accelerate commercial availability and global market penetration," the founders said in a statement. One of the aims of 5G, the technology standards for the next generation of much faster and more reliable mobile telecoms networks, is to enable a wide variety of devices to connect up and operate via the Internet - the "Internet of Things." Network equipment providers such as Ericsson and Nokia have said the 5G technology currently in development could be available for use as early as next year but mass-market upgrades to mobile networks are not expected until some time around 2020. A spokesman for the newly formed partnership said there were talks with several network operators to join the association, declining to give any names. Last year BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen's Audi, joined forces to buy digital map maker HERE for 2.8 billion euros (US$3.15 billion) from Nokia and this week will introduce a service that allows drivers to see for themselves what road conditions are like miles ahead using live data contributed by other vehicles.

Eric Risberg/AP/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of While the technology industry is heavily criticized for lack of diversity, Asians are rarely part of the discussion, owing to the prevailing stereotype of Asians as engineers and coders well-loved by Silicon Valley. But a lawsuit filed Monday by the US Department of Labor may change the narrative. Palantir Technologies, a data company co-founded by tech financier Peter Thiel and partially financed by the investment arm of the Central Intelligence Agency, was accused of routinely discriminating against Asian job candidates in its hiring process. The lawsuit is the first of its kind against a Silicon Valley company, Rose Darling, a senior trial attorney for the Labor Department tells the Associated Press. The suit is unusual because company reports and industry studies show that Asians are overrepresented in the tech industry. Efforts to diversify hiring practices more often focus on adding women, African Americans, and Hispanics into the workforce instead of Asians. Recommended: Would Google hire you? 10 test questions to find out Palantir denied the allegations Monday and said it will contest the suit. It said that the government's case "relies on a narrow and flawed statistical analysis relating to three job descriptions from 2010 to 2011."

While Asians are well-represented in the tech industry, the representation doesn’t extend to the executive level, a phenomena that applies to other minority groups as well. A study released May 2015 by Ascend, a pan-Asian organization of business professionals in North America, found that while Asians represent 27.2 percent of the professional workforce for tech giants Google, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, LinkedIn and Yahoo, only 13.9 percent of them are executives.   “The common assumption is that Asians are successful since so many of them already work in Silicon Valley companies,” Janet Wong, a former partner at KPMG and study co-author said in a press release. "However, our deeper EPI analysis reveals that while Asians are well-represented – even overrepresented – at the staff and professional levels, they are underrepresented in the management pipeline and barely seen at the executive levels." The executive positions are dominated by white men followed by white women, Hispanic men and Asian men, with black women and Hispanic women at the tail end. There are as many Asian professionals as white professionals in these companies, but the report finds that white women and men are 154 percent more likely to be an executive. Asian women are especially underrepresented at the management level. Some of the reasons the researchers gave for the small number of Asian employees transitioning to management positions include a lack of role models and gaps in leadership expectations and training. “I consider myself third-generation Chinese American, and I grew up with my parents and grandparents, and their culture was what I grew up with,” Ms. Wong told the Los Angeles Times in an interview. “They told me all I needed to do was stay in school, make good grades, and that was all I needed to be successful. They never taught me the soft skills or leadership skills. So when I started my career, I thought all I had to do was keep my head down, do good work, and I’d be acknowledged and have a successful career.” Other studies have also found  wage gaps between minorities and whites in the high-tech industry, although the gap between Asians and whites is smaller than for other minorities, as USA Today reported in 2014. Some Asian employees in the tech industry have spoken out on social media about that the lack of dissent in the Asian community, and theorized that it could be part of the reason why the problem persists. “We are the “model minority” – quiet, hardworking, well-educated, successful in a middle class sort of way.… It’s good enough that we don’t complain about the erasure of our individual identities and work ethic and personal successes, we don’t complain about the bamboo ceiling, we stay quiet on issues of race,” wrote Tracy Chou, software engineer at Pinterest in a LinkedIn post. “To my fellow Asians in tech: It’s time for us to start caring, to start talking, to start doing something about the racial disparities in our industry.” Some Asian Americans in the tech industry may feel awkward discussing this when it may seem as if they already have a foot in the door. Some may point to Indian executives at companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Nokia as examples of Asians representation in the tech industry, the Wall Street Journal reports.  Anil Dash, an Indian American and a two-decade veteran in the tech industry, argues in a Medium post that those are rare. In fact, Mr. Dash tells The Christian Science Monitor in a phone interview, the situation is getting worse compared to when he entered the field. “There has been a lot of pushback … (and sentiment of) I got in, why am i going to complain?” Dash says. “Especially for first generation immigrants who are excited about the opportunity, but also don’t know the tradeoff they’re making.” Dash points out the tendency for these companies to hire foreigners in the tech industry as one of the reasons. These employees with no permanent immigration status – many are Asians –  face problems securing their status and don’t hold much leverage in asking for career advancement. The Ascend report recommends examining the hiring processes to ensure biases are absent and to develop culture-specific leadership programs. Many tech companies now  have initiatives to increase the numbers of Asians and other minorities in leadership positions, The Los Angeles Times reports. Dash, like Chou, says he believes that Asians in the tech industry, especially Asian men, should begin speaking up for themselves and for other minority groups. Non-Asian minority groups still face hurdles in accessing capital, technology, and perceptional biases in even getting their foot in the door compared to Asians. “We should acknowledge that we haven’t said enough about anti-Black and anti-Latino attitudes, and that we have not articulated our complicity in industry sexism and misogyny. Indeed, we have often helped build these systems of exclusion, not merely remained silent while they were enforced,” he wrote in the Medium post two years ago. “We can do justice to our peers and coworkers who are working in an unfair system, bringing them closer to the level playing field they deserve.” Next up Test your knowledge Would Google hire you? 10 test questions to find out Focus Can familiarity build trust?

Addressing these issues, UNICEF India has come out with a Child Online Protection in India report, which offers a glimpse into the risks and threats children face when they use the internet and social media. The report states that despite there being about 400 million Internet users in India, a majority of which are the youth, there are no reliable figures on the extent, patterns and trends of child online abuse and exploitation. This is because no comprehensive survey has been carried out. The report also found that according to the Teens, Tweens and Technology Survey commissioned by Intel Securities in India in 2015, around 43 per cent of children active on social media claimed to have witnessed cruel behaviour on social networks, while 52 per cent indicated that they had themselves bullied people over social media. ‘Must work together’ The option to stay anonymous online and impersonate others also emboldens people into criminal acts and lower the deterrent potential of laws, says the report. The report says that cyber crimes against children, which can manifest in many forms like sexting, online grooming, production and distribution of child pornography and cyber bullying, are under-reported and not included in the National Crime Records Bureau statistics as a separate category. The report also stresses the importance of empowering parents, professionals and policy-makers to play an active role in preventing and protecting children from online abuse and exploitation. “No single agency or government institution can ensure the safety of children from online threats and violence. This calls for all to work together,” said Louis-Georges Arsenault, UNICEF India Representative. Speaking at the launch of the report, Ajay Kumar, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, said that the ministry is taking steps to block sites depicting child abuse but child online safety requires collective effort from all stakeholders.

I’m writing this paragraph in Word for Windows on Windows 10. The process is as smooth as you’d expect on PC hardware built for Windows, with no hesitation or freezing, and all the features are enabled. But I’m not using a Windows PC; I’m using a three-year-old MacBook Air. And I haven’t had to give over the Air entirely to Windows. Instead, I’m running Windows 10 and its apps concurrently with the brand-new macOS Sierra. For instance, the Windows version of Word is running in its own window, right alongside open Mac apps, including Apple Mail and Safari. I’m doing this all with the new version of a 10-year-old program, Parallels Desktop, from a Seattle-area company of the same name, which came out last month for $80. It’s faster and smoother than ever, and has some new tricks, including a new Mac utility suite that’s also sold separately. With ParalleIs Desktop, I can hop back and forth between Sierra and Windows 10 — and even between individual apps — with ease. I just copied and pasted the paragraph above into Apple’s proprietary Notes app, exactly as I could from a native Mac app. And I wrote this sentence in Notes and copied and pasted it back into the Windows version of Word. Then I copied and pasted the whole thing again from Word for Windows into Google Docs running in Safari natively on the Mac. Windows 10, windowed, on a three-year-old MacBook Air Through all this, the aging Air performed smoothly and quickly, even though I’m now running three Windows apps and 11 Mac apps, including two browsers — Microsoft Edge and Apple Safari — with about 15 tabs open, total. That includes two instances of the constantly updating TweetDeck app for Twitter power users. The only sign of strain is the constant, low whir of the fans. But, to be honest, my faithful Air cranks up the fans pretty often these days even when running just macOS, and did so even before Sierra. (God, I hope Apple gives the Air a power bump, and soon.) When Parallels first came out, in 2006, I called it “a pleasure to use” and “the best of both worlds.” After using this new version, Parallels 12, I can say with confidence that, in my tests, it still is. If you love and use the Mac, but need to use a few Windows apps, Parallels does the trick. The world has changed However, the world has changed a lot since then, and the need for Parallels has diminished for average Mac users. When it was launched, shortly after Apple switched the Mac to the same Intel processors that Windows used, it was a big deal, because there were still lots of apps only available for Windows, or which — like Microsoft Office — were vastly better on Windows. Parallels also offered a smoother solution than Apple’s own method for solving this problem: a feature called Boot Camp that’s still built into the Mac. Boot Camp also allowed running Windows on a Mac, but it required you to carve out a separate Windows partition on your hard disk, and you could only run one OS at a time. You had to reboot each time you wanted to switch. Mac-native and web-based apps are more ubiquitous now than in 2006 Now, however, the web and web apps have drastically reduced Mac users’ need to run local Windows apps. Macs have become more common (though still a minority of PCs) and app makers have produced many more good Mac-native apps than existed in 2006. Even Microsoft has brought the native Mac version of Office far closer to parity with the Windows version. Perhaps even more important has been the rise of smartphones and tablets, where Apple maintains a strong position. Many PC use cases have moved to mobile apps, and Apple’s iOS mobile operating system gets excellent versions of these apps, and often gets them first. The Mac-Windows rivalry has been replaced by the iOS-Android rivalry, and iPhone and iPad users aren’t at an app disadvantage. But some still will find it useful So why would anyone still need or want Parallels? Well, some programs and sites, especially in banking and finance, are still Windows-only, or still require Internet Explorer, which lacks a Mac version. Some people who work for big companies still need to use in-house apps that run on Windows only. Some power users of Office still prefer the Windows version. Developers also find it useful. And Parallels doesn’t just run Windows 10: it can run multiple versions of Windows, Linux, and even older Mac operating systems in virtual machines. Plus, heavy-duty PC games are still written almost entirely for Windows. Parallels can solve the first set of issues, but, while it has gotten better at Windows games, it can’t handle enough of them well enough for me to recommend it to gamers. (The company does say that Parallels 12 can, with the proper settings, let you play Blizzard’s Overwatch, as an example. And it says it can handle the Xbox app on Windows 10, because the Xbox is doing the work. But I didn’t test games.) Interoperability between the two systems is impressive, and goes well beyond copy and paste. For instance, I was able, on the first try, to get Apple’s Siri (now on the Mac) to launch the Windows Calendar app and to get Spotlight to launch Groove Music on Windows. And I was able to get Cortana, the Windows assisant, to launch Keynote from the macOS. Icons for Windows 10 and for individual Windows programs you’re using show up in the Mac’s Dock just like Mac apps, and can be kept there permanently if you like. On the Windows side, Mac folder icons live on the desktop next to local Windows ones. You can open and work on Mac files with your Windows apps. And a C: drive appears in the Mac Finder’s list of sources, so you can call up Windows files. The Mac’s Command key works as the Windows key when you’re using Windows. Parallels has always stored its virtual machine in a big file in the Documents folder on the Mac, which also includes files you saved to the virtual PC. But it takes up less room than you’d think, and, in Sierra, this big file can automatically be moved to the cloud. In my tests, Parallels 12 cost me only about nine gigabytes, even though I have two Parallels virtual machines: a new Windows 10 one and an older one running Windows 8. Fetching things from the cloud worked quickly. A new utility The company is also touting a new companion utility, called Parallels Toolbox, which lives in the Mac’s toolbar and lets you do a variety of things with one or two clicks. These include locking the screen, muting the mic, archiving files, downloading streaming media from the web, and recording actions on the screen. It works whether you’re running Mac or Windows at the moment. In my tests, it worked well, and the company says it will add more features over time. But it’s expensive for a utility bundle, at $10 a year. (A basic version is bundled with the standard edition of Parallels Desktop; the edition which will get more features is included with pricier Pro and Business versions of Parallels, which cost $100 a year.) Pricing As noted above, the basic edition of Parallels 12 costs $80, at parallels.com. But unless you got it as a free upgrade, you’ll also have to buy Windows 10. I bought a copy for $120, using a very nice Parallels wizard that takes you to Microsoft’s web store to buy it, then installs it for you. It will also install a legal disk image of Windows if you get one elsewhere. Bottom line I have a soft spot for breakthrough products like Parallels, even years after they appear. I remain impressed by its quality and performance. And I can recommend it for developers, or average Mac users who just need to use a few Windows apps.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Enterprises would rather go for IaaS instead of PaaS or SaaS By Sead Fadilpašić DevOps teams spend most of their time managing complex environments, a new report says. Shares Just above half of enterprises (51 per cent), which decide to deploy a cloud solution, opt for Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), over Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), or Software-as-a-Service (Saas).  This is according to a new report by Intel DCM, based on a survey of 204 US-based IT managers, directors, software engineers and DevOps responsible for overseeing their enterprise cloud strategy. The report also states that DevOps teams spend most of their time monitoring complex environments in their organisation.  That includes tuning infrastructure, and remediation analysis. Besides Software-as-a-Service, and Platform-as-a-Service, IaaS is considered a main category for cloud computing services. It provides virtualised computing resources, over the internet. It works by having a third party provider hosting all the hardware, software, servers, storage and any other infrastructure components. Applications are also handled by the host, including things like system maintenance and backup.  The biggest advantage of IaaS platforms is that they are an extremely scalable resource, which can be expanded or shrunk, depending on the needs of the business using it. IaaS is usually considered the number one option for temporary or experimental workloads.  There are many Infrastructure-as-a-Service providers out there, with Amazon (Amazon Web Services – AWS), Google (Google Compute Engine), and Microsoft (Windows Azure) standing out as the biggest competitors. Other notable mentions include Rackspace (Open Cloud) and IBM (SmartCloud Enterprise).

Together with Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia and Qualcomm Incorporated the automotive giants are launching the “5G Automotive Association” that will develop, test and promote communications solutions, support standardization and accelerate commercial availability and global market penetration. The goal of this new endeavor is to address society’s connected mobility and road safety needs with applications such as connected automated driving, ubiquitous access to services and integration into smart cities and intelligent transportation. With next generation 5G mobile networks and continued strong LTE evolution, which includes Cellular Vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communication, the focus of information and communication technologies (ICT) witowards the Internet of Things and the digitalization of industries. As an evolution to today’s networks, next generation mobile networks are expected to handle much more data volume, connect many more devices, significantly reduce latency and bring new levels of reliability. For example, 5G can better support mission-critical communications for safer driving and will further support enhanced vehicle-to-everything communications and connected mobility solutions. These new solutions bring new technological and business opportunities for both the automotive and ICT industries, and the members of the association will closely collaborate to realize the full potential together. The association will address key technical and regulatory issues, leveraging next generation mobile networks and integrating vehicle platforms with connectivity, networking and computing solutions. Through this new association, the companies will be looking to define and harmonize use cases, technical requirements and implementation strategies as well as supporting standardization and regulatory bodies, certification and approval processes. Addressing vehicle-to-everything technology requirements, such as wireless connectivity, security, privacy, authentication and distributed cloud architectures will also play an important role in the scope of the association later down the line. Christoph Voigt is appointed Chairperson of the Board and Dino Flore is appointed Director General of the Association. The Association will support and work in close cooperation with national and regional initiatives, such as the European Connected & Automated Driving Pre-Deployment Project. audiBMW ConnectedDriveHERE mapsMercedes Benz Previous post BMW testing a 1 Series Sedan M Performance in Spain Next post Video: BMW M2 Versus Porsche Cayman S on the Track RECOMMENDED FOR YOU Most BMWs to lose ConnectedDrive services in 2017 If you currently have a new-ish BMW with ConnectedDrive or BMW Assist features, such as SOS, BMW Assist eCall and Concierge Call, it’s likely you will … Will the Inline-Six engine be the new norm?

The hardware is likely to run on Google's newest operating system 'Andromeda', a hybrid OS which merges the major features of Android and Google chrome. Internally termed as 'Bison', the ultra thin pixel 3 laptop will come with a 12.3 display and completely supports tablet mode too. Bison is speculated to be powered by either Intel core M5 or Core i5 processor wherein it'll be supplemented by 8GB and 16GB RAM for 32GB and 128GB hard disks respectively. With 10mm thickness and finger print scanner, the price of this Google's hardware may start from 799$. Reportedly, the Andromeda OS is also coming in a Huawei-made Nexus tablet which would likely hit the markets by end of this year or early 2017. Being named as Huawei 7P, Google's tablet comes with 7 inch display and 4GB RAM. Andromeda OS, being the mix bag of Chrome and Android, is something to looking forward for and it'll first be introduced in all Nexus-tablets. Google, which recently launched a counterpart to WhatsApp in the form of Allo, is considering to target Apple's MacBook with 'Bison'. Also, the company is planning to release its pixel smartphone at an official event next week.

Properly insuring these vehicles and their occupants, says Quadrant Information Services, will require new, high-speed approaches to data analysis. Pleasanton, CA (PRWEB) September 28, 2016 In August, Ford Motor Company announced plans to produce fully autonomous cars by 2021. These vehicles will be manufactured in high-volume production and will be tailored for ride-hailing and ride-sharing operations, which means they will not have steering wheels, brake pedals, or other controls for human occupants.1 “This is a new world for insurers,” said Michael Macauley, CEO of Quadrant Information Services, a leading supplier of pricing analytics services to property and casualty insurance carriers. “The industry will need a whole new set of data tools to deal with this.” Macauley noted that at the moment, auto insurance rates are based on what an insurer knows about the driver, the driver’s residential area, and the car. The combination of a teenage driver, a new Corvette Stingray and a high-crime neighborhood, for example, would yield one rate. A middle-aged driver with a perfect record, a quiet home town and a five-year-old Honda would yield quite another. Now, however, the industry is confronting a situation wherein there may be no driver, in which case, the owner’s age and driving record would be largely irrelevant. Coverage and rate decisions would be based on a wide range of variables, among them traffic patterns, prevailing climatic conditions (there is some question as to how well driverless cars manage in rain and snow2) and, above all, the track record of the various technologies involved. “These vehicles,” Macauley said, “will be the work not so much of a single manufacturer, but of a consortium.” He noted that Ford’s announcement of its forthcoming driverless cars described partnerships with Velodyne (lidar sensors that capture high-resolution images of the area around the vehicles), SAIPS (an Israel-based computer vision and machine learning company which Ford acquired in August), Civil Maps (a California-based company that develops high-resolution 3D maps), and Nirenberg Neuroscience (a machine-vision company that specializes in object recognition and bringing human-like levels of intelligence to machine modules). Prospective competitors are making similar arrangements; BMW, Mobileye and Intel, for example, recently announced that they are partnering on fully-autonomous vehicle technology to apply in a shared environment by 2021.3 Questions have been raised about the safety of self-driving vehicles, particularly since a driver in a Tesla Model S in self-driving mode was killed when the car drove itself into the side of a semitrailer in Florida last May. In its statement about the incident, Tesla did not delineate the driver’s level of engagement at the time of the crash, but it did note that “neither the autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the semitrailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied.”4 Some manufacturers—including Ford—are pursuing a path towards a fully computer-managed, no-human-driver car, because they feel that hybrid approaches which allow for some degree of human control, such as Tesla’s, contain an unacceptable level of built-in risk. Google, for example (which has its own driverless car program), decided on the no-wheel, no-pedals approach after allowing its employees to drive the company’s test cars. “There was a brief period when people would be a little nervous and monitor the car very carefully,” Google engineer Nathanial Fairfield said, “and then they would start to relax and trust the system, and then they would over-trust the system and start to get distracted.” After watching a driver rummaging around in his back seat in search of a phone-charging cord, Google engineers decided it would be too risky to create a system wherein a driver would be expected to take control of the car at a critical moment.5 “Obviously,” Quadrant’s Macauley said, “it’s not going to be up to the property and casualty insurance industry to determine when driverless cars take to the road, how they operate, and what kinds of technology they use. It is, however, going to be up to insurance carriers to understand the situation and evaluate the risks posed by different operators—if that’s even the right word—in different cars on different roads and in different weather, using a variety of technologies. To do that, they will need robust, cloud-based computing and powerful, high-speed data analytics. This is essential, because with people putting themselves on the road while in the hands of technology they don’t control, the importance of making sure drivers are properly insured is exponentially high—as will be the demand for that insurance. In this emerging world of new and very complex risk factors, big data tools, such as those under development at Quadrant, will be crucial to the ability of agencies to find the right plans for their customers.” About Quadrant Information Services: Quadrant Information Services, headquartered in Pleasanton, CA, provides pricing analytics solutions for property and casualty insurance companies. Quadrant gives actuary, product development, pricing, sales and marketing personnel at its client companies—which include all the major insurance carriers in the United States— the data they need in order to make accurate, data-driven decisions. An industry innovator since its founding in 1991, Quadrant has provided the P&C insurance field with a long series of technological advances—most recently InsureWatch, the industry’s first cloud-based pricing tool, which allows the user to produce unlimited combinations of reports with the click of a mouse.

Next Story BlackBerry says it's done designing and building its own phones Tech Drones First Click First Click: DJI helps China pivot from global copycat to tech innovator September 28th, 2016 By Thomas Ricker on September 28, 2016 07:30 am @Trixxy 8 Tweet Share Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share Verge reporter Ben Popper describing the rise of DJI in his report from China yesterday: "In early 2012, DJI released the Flamewheel, its first drone frame. The unit was meant for serious hobbyists, and came as a bare piece of metal to which you could add your choice of parts. Much assembly was required. Then, in December of 2012, DJI released the Phantom, and everything changed. The company was so used to operating in the background that the first Phantom didn’t carry DJI’s brand, save for a small, removable sticker. But the product quickly blossomed into a massive hit. "They kind of reinvented the whole industry with that," says Michael Blades, a drone industry analyst with Frost and Sullivan. The Phantom was powerful enough to appeal to professionals, but simple enough for beginners. It had serious range and stability, but required no assembly out of the box. "That really bridged the gap between a toy and tool," says Blades. In the four years since, DJI has emerged as the clear industry leader. "They became the 800-pound gorilla."" Reading this, I was struck by how easily you could replace "Flamewheel" with "Apple I," and "Phantom" with "Apple II," and you’d be describing the beginnings of one of the most famous innovation stories in US history. But DJI isn’t based in the US — it’s a technology company based in China, and that should worry Silicon Valley. The great U.S. hope failed DJI isn’t just a drone company, it’s the drone company. If you’ve got the cash, you start by looking at DJI and then work your way down a growing list of Chinese quadcopter makers. GoPro entered the drone market last week with the announcement of its foldable Karma. The great US hope inexplicably failed, however, to include two features any thrill-seeking GoPro fan requires: collision avoidance and follow-me. DJI’s brand-new Mavic Pro delivers those missing features and then some for roughly the same price as the Karma, including new hands-free gesture controls that let you wave your arms to get the drone’s attention and then signal it to follow you. What could be better for the self-obsessed snowboarders, surfers, or mountain bikers that dominate GoPro advertising? I shouldn’t be too hard on GoPro. After all, it’s a newcomer to flight — unlike another US drone maker, 3D Robotics. Like DJI, 3DR grew out of the DIY drone scene popular with hobbyists and aerial cinema pros. It even hired Colin Guinn, former head of DJI North America. 3DR’s Solo drone looked like a strong competitor to the DJI Phantom when it launched last year. Unfortunately, the company ran into manufacturing and supply chain issues that crippled delivery. 3DR has since turned its back on consumer drones in order to focus on enterprise applications, causing it to shed a number of employees in the process. Colin Guinn left 3DR earlier this month. DJI’s class-leading machine vision technology is provided by Movidius, soon to be a new division of Intel. So at least the Valley is represented by having its silicon inside some of China’s most advanced drones. But the code enabling Mavic’s advanced flight capabilities is developed in-house by DJI. Intel is also a major investor in Yuneec — DJI’s chief competitor. In April, DJI filed a patent lawsuit against China-based Yuneec, leading some to speculate that DJI will look elsewhere for its Vision Processing Unit chips after the Intel acquisition was announced three weeks ago (DJI’s new Mavic Pro uses Movidius’ latest VPU). In the 2000s, China was notorious for producing a glut of cheap gadget clones of absurd quality and laughable branding like "Nokla" and "iPhonc." Back in the day when most of The Verge's founders wrote for Engadget, we ran a series called Keepin' It Real Fake, or KIRF. Almost without exception those brazen knock-offs were of Chinese origin. "They can copy fast, but they can’t innovate," went the refrain. DJI is the tip of the spear DJI is no KIRF. Far from it, and probably the most highly visible exception that China has yet to produce. DJI’s innovations are most visible at the product level, but they can also be seen in manufacturing, retail, and the customer experience. I’d wager it’s only the point of a spear headed right for the heart of Silicon Valley. And if DJI is the tip, then companies like Oppo, Xiaomi, Vivo, and Huawei form the shaft that will quickly follow. But really, after outsourcing the world’s high-tech manufacturing and engineering jobs to Shenzhen for more than a decade, how can anyone feign surprise?

Amy Schumer Is The Most Dangerous Celebrity To Search For In 2016 By Ed Biggs in Lifestyle / Showbiz on 28 September 2016 Facebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest StumbleUpon Reddit Fark Email Comment Follow Amy Schumer Amy Schumer Justin Bieber Ellie Goulding Will Smith Rita Ora Rihanna Calvin Harris Internet security Intel Security (McAfee) published its annual list of the most dangerous celebrities to search for online in 2016. She’s long been a thorn in the side of the patriarchy with her irreverent and forthright brand of comedy, but now Amy Schumer is proving to be actively dangerous – to internet users who search for her name! A new report conducted on various search engines by anti-virus experts shows that Amy Schumer has been the most dangerous name to search for online in 2016, as the internet security firm Intel Security published its annual list of the TV, music and film stars whose names are most regularly hijacked by hackers to lure people to sites carrying malware. Amy Schumer is the most dangerous celebrity to search for online in 2016 Hackers use the public’s interest in celebrity news to entice unsuspecting fans to web addresses that download viruses to their computers, or steal passwords and personal information for the purposes of identity theft. Often, such sites are cleverly disguised as reputable news outlets. The research shows that a search for Amy Schumer carries a 16.11% risk of clicking on a rogue site like this – the highest of any celebrity in the United States. In descending order, Justin Bieber, TV host Carson Daly, Will Smith and Rihanna all have a greater than 13% chance of producing such a result.

Nick Viney, consumer vice president at Intel Security – known as McAfee in Europe – said of the new report: “The desire for consumers to stay up to date with the latest celebrity gossip can often make them unwittingly vulnerable to cybercrime. Many consumers are quick to click but do they actually stop and consider the potential risks this poses by doing so? “Cybercriminals are keen to exploit this craving for real-time information on celebrities, and will lead consumers to sites that download harmful malware onto devices to ultimately steal an individual's all important, and incredibly valuable, data.” More: Amy Schumer argues about wine with Ramona Singer during parody debate Contactmusic Facebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest StumbleUpon Reddit Fark Email Comment Follow Amy Schumer Advertisement Related Amy Schumer & Whoopi Goldberg: 'We're Not Leaving America' Goldie Hawn Plots Comedic Comeback After Working With Amy Schumer Amy Schumer buys $12.1 million NYC penthouse Amy Schumer Responds To Formation Parody Backlash Amy Schumer: 'Jay Z and Beyonce approved Formation video' Amy Schumer Branded Racist For 'Formation' Beyonce Parody Amy Schumer And Goldie Hawn Share Beyonce Parody Video Advertisement Amy Schumer Pens Open Letter To Those Who Walked Out Of Her Show After A Donald Trump Joke Amy Schumer Reads Open Letter About Tampa Walkouts Onstage Fans Walk Out Of Amy Schumer Show As Comedy Turns Political Amy Schumer Dissing Trump Causes Some Fans To Walk Out Of Florida Gig Amy Schumer Named Most Dangerous Celebrity To Search Online Amy Schumer Is The Most Dangerous Celebrity To Search For In 2016 Amy Schumer Makes History On Highest-paid Comedians List Advertisement Movies and Trailers Trainwreck Movie Review Amy Schumer makes her big screen debut with a script that feels like a much-extended...

Intel's Beignet OpenCL For Linux Now Supports LLVM 3.9 Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 28 September 2016 at 06:44 AM EDT. 2 Comments With the recent Beignet 1.2 release some Phoronix readers expressed disappointment that this Intel OpenCL implementation for Iris/HD Graphics hadn't supported the recently-released LLVM 3.9. Well, now it does. The patches have landed. It ended up being rather invasive supporting LLVM 3.9 with over 200 lines of new code to accommodate API changes made for this six-month update to the LLVM compiler stack. It would have been nice to see Beignet support this latest LLVM release earlier on, but at least now it's in Git for those wanting to pair it with the newest LLVM code. 2 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Social Media Computers & Laptops Mobiles & Tablets Other Gadgets ​L&T Technology Services to focus on top 30, adjacent customers Rajesh Kurup   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Keshab Panda, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, LTTS Mumbai, Sept 28:   L&T Technology Services Ltd (LTTS), Larsen & Toubro’s engineering and research and development arm, is to focus more on its top 30 customers who contribute 65 per cent of its revenues. The company will also concentrate on adjacent companies that work in the same space as its clients. This is under the company’s policy, T-30 and A-3, which came into effect in April 2016, LTTS Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Keshab Panda told BusinessLine​ in an interview. LTTS revenues from T-30 accounts stood at 65 per cent of the total in FY16, which is expected to grow at the same or a higher pace this year, he said, declining to provide “futuristic” statements. Some of the top customers for LTTS are Danaher, Scania, UTC, P&G, John Deere and BMW, among others, according to the Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP) filed with market regulator SEBI. The company has developed Internet of Things (IoT) solutions such as UbiqWeise and iBEMS in emerging technology areas to support its customers, Panda said. LTTS has also tied up with Intel as its go-to-market partner for its smart buildings platform, iBEMS, which enables Net-Zero, energy generation management, predictive and preventive maintenance to help steer-away from energy consumption to energy generation and helps customers save up to 40 per cent of energy costs. Using UBIQWeise, LTTS has designed a smart connected thermostat that is WiFi capable and controls all aspects of indoor air leveraging IoT, cloud and mobility solutions. This solution has been rolled out in the North American market, Panda said. For the company, Europe and the US is about 80 per cent of the market, and these geographies are expected to grow on a revenue basis even though it could be steady on a percentage basis. The company is also looking at focusing more on Japan and Korea in Asia, he said, adding LTTS does “very little work” in West Asia, while exposure in the UK is close to zero. MONETISING PATENTS Further, LTTS has 168 patents of which 34 are owned by the company and 134 are co-authored with global clients. The company is also looking to monetise them. “We will look at monetising the patents, which are filed across different geographies.” However, he did not give a time line for the monetisation. LTTS debuted on September 23, following a $134-million initial public offering (IPO). The Rs 900-crore IPO of L&T Technology Services was oversubscribed 2.53 times during September 12-15. The price band for the offer was fixed at Rs 850-860. This is the second company from the L&T group to hit the market with an IPO since July, when L&T Infotech had launched a public offer. The flagship Larsen and Toubro is already listed.

English Cafe > Tech > Samsung Huawei’s smartwatch likely to run on Samsung Tizen OS   Published : 2016-09-28 16:47 Updated : 2016-09-29 14:28 [THE INVESTOR] Chinese tech behemoth Huawei is reportedly planning to develop smartwatches running on Tizen, an open-source operating system developed by a group of tech firms including Samsung Electronics and Intel. Local daily JoongAng Ilbo reported that Huawei has recently joined hands with Samsung, a leading Tizen alliance member, to deploy the operating system in its next smartwatches. The anticipated collaboration is the first of its kind since the launch of Tizen in 2012.  The local daily quoted an industry insider as saying, “Huawei was looking for an OS other than Google’s Android as the US firm had not been very collaborative.” Samsung, on the other hand, is said to have pledged to fully cooperate in having the Tizen OS tailored for the Chinese firm’s digital watches. Samsung has been trying to increase the presence of Tizen in the global OS market for the past years, but Google and Apple still enjoy dominance in the OS segment -- 86.2 percent and 12.9 percent, respectively, as of the second quarter this year, according to research firm Gartner. Samsung has rolled out low-range Galaxy Z smartphones and home appliances fitted with the Tizen OS. A spokesperson of Samsung, said, however, “Samsung has not officially received any request for such collaboration from Huawei yet.” By Kim Young-won (wone0102@heraldcorp.com) 영어뉴스를 통한 ListeningㆍReading 실력 향상 단기 학습 프로그램 [NEST] 1.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Lenovo X1 Yoga Review By Hubert Nguyen on 09/27/2016 05:00 PST Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga Photos Introduced a while ago, the ThinkPad X1 Yoga has shipped for some time. We have waited to have both the LCD and OLED options before publishing this review. In our initial coverage of the X1 Yoga, it was evident that the only 14-inch OLED laptop display should be given a chance of proving itself in the real world. The X1 Yoga is Lenovo’s latest thin & light business laptop that continues a successful series built to pass military durability tests. The configuration tested has the following specifications: Intel i7 6500 2.5-2.59 GHz processor Other configurations include i5-6500U, i5-6300U, i7-6500U, and i76600U 8GB RAM Win 10 Pro LCD IPS and OLED display Samsung 512GB SSD over PCI-E Design With dimensions of 13.11 x 9.02 x 0.59 inches (333 x 229 x 15mm) and a weight of only 2.8 Lbs, the Lenovo X1 Yoga is positioned in the thin & light category of laptops which tends to blend portability and productivity well. The 2.8 lbs weight is comfortable, and well within the norm for this category of laptops. This is equivalent to Lenovo’s own Y900 (2.8Lbs) and the Dell XPS13 9350 (2.8 Lbs) that we previously reviewed but not as light as the Surface Pro 4 (1.73 Lbs) which remains the thinnest and lightest PC in this performance range. As usual with the Lenovo X1 Series, the keyboard is very comfortable, and keys have a travel distance of 1.86mm (60g of force), which is ideal for my use. The keys are large and comfortable, and I find the keyboard to be excellent in general. The only think that caught my attention is that the “Fn” button on the right side is now at the corner of the keyboard, where the CTRL key normally is. It’s slightly annoying at first, but I got used to it, eventually. The trackpad feels like it’s made of glass, and is very smooth. Its size is 100x58mm is nice, and Lenovo allows the users to either click on the pad itself or use one of the two physical left/middle/right buttons just above the trackpad. Normally, they are there to be used with the TrackPoint controller which is the red button between the B/G/H keys. Many Lenovo customers are die-hard fans, although I am not one myself. The Thinkpad X1 Yoga has a relatively large number of ports, and a quick look at the specs show WiGig, OneLink+, Mini DisplayPort, HDMI, 3 x USB 3.0, microSD. The three USB 3.0 ports are a great thing if you often work with USB devices such as Ethernet to USB adapter, mouse or USB keys, just to cite the frequent ones. The microSD port is hidden in the back of the laptop, next to a SIM card tray. As it was the case with previous models, the X1 Yoga has an integrated wireless broadband option (4G LTE-A). For power users, this is much better than creating a hotspot with your phone, if you can afford the additional SIM card subscription. Digital Pen (Wacom) The Lenovo X1 Yoga has an integrated Wacom Active ES pen. Note that this is different from the earlier Wacom EMR pens that Lenovo used to have. In case you want to buy compatible Wacom pens it’s a critical detail to know. The X1 comes pre-installed with the Wacom driver and the Wacom Pen Radial Menu utility. It lets you change things such as the pen tip sensitivity, the physical buttons functions and the pen calibration (it’s pretty time-sensitive). I’m no artist, but I’ve used Wacom tablets in the past. In general, I’m impressed with the pen, and the speed of the ink. The normal ink is very fast, and things will slow down as you use complex brushes but this is so much better than what we had just a year ago. If you wonder, it works well with Photoshop CC of course. Durability: MIL-STD-810G Drop Test compliant The ThinkPad X1 Yoga is one of the rare, if not the only, 13”-14” with a thin & light form factor. This has been one of the X1 staple features since the beginning, and it remains a potentially important criteria for users who may need extra durability over good looks. You can learn all the necessary details about the MIL-STD-810G tests, but the gist of it is that the Lenovo X1 Yoga design was dropped from a height of about 4-feet, and all its surfaces (faces, edges, corners) were tested and visually inspected for damage. The test was originally designed to make sure that U.S military equipment could survive the transport and storage in tough conditions. Lenovo says that the X1 passes eight military tests, but doesn’t provide details about which ones. The only one that I’m sure was included is the drop/shock test. Learn more: What is MIL-STD-810G? Not part of the MIL-STD-810G standard is the tough skin that the X1 has. I have used several generations of X1 laptops, and they are incredibly resilient to scratches and blemishes. Some of the issues that I had with all-metal aluminum bodies is that they could scratch pretty easily if there’s even a bit of dust/sand in the backpack. And the scratches can be quite visible. I never worried so much about the X1 family of laptops. The X1 Yoga passed the following tests: Humidity, Low Temperatures, High Temperatures, Sand, High Vibration, Shocks, 15000ft Altitude and Temperature Shock. Fingerprint touch sensor This time, Lenovo has integrated a touch fingerprint sensor (vs. swipe sensor). It works exactly like a smartphone fingerprint reader that you set up with a little utility for a few seconds. It worked very well and had very few false-positive (zero for now, but I assume it does happen sometimes). It is also more advanced that most options you can find for Desktop computers — it’s pretty amazing how primitive those finger-swiping USB sensors are. Because I use a fairly strong (long) password, and I don’t want to fallback to a measly 4-digit pin, I find the fingerprint sensor to be very convenient. Now, you can use a very strong password and won’t have to deal with it every time you come back to your locked laptop. Learn more: How do Fingerprint Scanners Work? Display: IPS or OLED The Lenovo X1 Yoga comes with two 2560×1440 touch display options: IPS or OLED. I had the opportunity to try both, and I will also compare it with the Lenovo Y900 IPS display as well. Note that there is a 1080p IPS Touch that I have not tested. The IPS display of the Lenovo X1 Yoga seems noticeably better than the Carbon X1 Gen 3. The backlight looks more evenly distributed, the colors look better, and the view angle seems to have improved as well. Since this was one of the rare weakness of the Carbon X1 Gen 3, I wanted to check that first. The brightness of this LCD display is 345 NIT when measured in our offices. The Lenovo Y900 IPS display comes with a glossy finish, which makes the colors “pop” more and can make the image seem a bit sharper thanks to the 3200×1800 resolution. However, it is more reflective outdoors, and of course, the Y900 is not a “milspec” computer, so it is not as durable. The Lenovo X1 Yoga’s OLED display looks amazing and it’s a pity that the photos don’t fully show the difference. The OLED technology allows the X1 Yoga to have a nearly infinite image contrast and colors that feature an amazing saturation. Even the brightness is higher, topping 455 NIT in our measurements. If you can afford it, I highly recommend selecting the OLED version of this computer because you will use the display 100% of the time, it’s worth it. Learn more: LCD vs. OLED. Which is Best And Why? If you look at The ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2015 or ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2014, you would notice that the display, while very decent, didn’t compare favorably with other Lenovo laptops such as the Yoga 2 and Yoga 3 Pro. It’s because to pass the Mil-Specs drop test, Lenovo couldn’t use the exact same display between X1 and Yoga laptops. The good news is that the OLED X1 Yoga solves this beautifully, now surpassing other Lenovo laptops, and quite frankly every other 13”-15” that I have looked at, in overall image quality (but not in resolution). The OLED X1 Yoga makes other laptop screens uninteresting. There are both touch and non-touch versions of the Lenovo X1 Yoga, so it’s up to you to choose which one fits your needs best. People have very strong opinions about touch in Windows laptops, and I’ve heard arguments both for and against. My take is that touch is convenient because it can be faster than swiping and tapping with the trackpad. I also understand that some people use a lot of keyboard shortcuts and don’t want to pay extra for the touch option. You will need to decide based on your own habits. Webcam The Lenovo X1 Yoga webcam works well for web chat with a clear shot and framing where your face is. The image quality is not impressive at all, even in good lighting, and it gets worse in low-light. It’s OK for video chats, but it would be nice to see something better here. Unfortunately, laptop webcams have been largely outpaced by smartphone selfie cameras in terms of image quality. The thing is: while the technology is there, OEMs aren’t really pushing for webcam performance. System Performance The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga has a wide range of options when it comes to computing power. The review unit we have is equipped with an Intel Core i7 6500 (2.5-2.59 GHz) processor and 8GB of RAM. Benchmarks show us that the X1 Yoga behaves very much like other computers that have a similar processor configuration. Keep in mind that because the graphics unit is integrated into the Intel processor, most computers of the same “CPU class” will behave very similarly when running games. This is completely normal, and unless an OEM does something horrible, this is what you should expect. There are other ways to differentiate. The general performance is very satisfying, and this computer can run most tasks without any particular problem. If you want to do specific things such as video editing, you can also use Intel’s QuickSync hardware which will accelerate certain forms of video-encoding. Other laptops with discrete graphics processors may outperform the Lenovo X1 Yoga at specific tasks, but they may also come with a higher power consumption, larger form-factor or a different set of pros/cons altogether. The same is true for gaming laptops. Speed and relation to value and weight If we look at performance through the prism of “value” (price), the Lenovo X1 Yoga does OK. It doesn’t particularly shine, and it’s not surprising since Core i5 laptops tend to have better performance/value (that’s their whole point of being). However, the performance in relation to the weight is one of the strengths of the Lenovo X1 Yoga, and keep in mind that we have not even tested the most powerful version of the X1 Yoga. There’s another one with a Core i7-6600U processor that should be a little faster. Since this laptop has a digital pen, let’s look at the Creative performance vs. money spent: Battery: 52Wh + RapidCharge With a 52 Wh battery capacity, the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga is comparable to a Dell XPS 13 (9350) and superior to the Envy 13t-d000 (45 Wh). However, the Yoga 900 (66 Wh) and the new Yoga 910 (64 Wh) have superior capacities. Note that the X1 Yoga has a rapid charging capability that somewhat compensates for the potential difference in sheer capacity. RapidCharge enables much faster charging from 0% to 80% battery in 30mn. In general, it is extremely effective if you can have access to a plug from hop to hop. If that is not an option, then you may want to think about a higher capacity laptop. In general, I can get some real work done for about ~4.5 hours, and accessing a plug by then is not an issue. Rapid-charging is ideal for folks like me since we often stop for 20-30mn during tradeshows to write something and post it to the back-end. Electric outlets are plentiful in conventions. Conclusion: durable, light, fast With a hardware platform that is comparable to other laptops in its class, the Lenovo X1 Yoga has a few key differentiators that are remarkable: Durability, OLED display option, Rapid charging. It is through this angle that we tested it. While it is possible to find many 13” (The X1 Yoga is a 14”) laptops that have an Intel Core i7-6500U, it is much harder to find some with all three qualities above. The OLED display option is simply sublime and worth the extra money, if you can afford it. OLED and Rapid Charging can benefit just about anyone. The extra durability and low-maintenance of the chassis is a cool extra, but unless you work environment is downright hostile, it’s more of a “nice to have” in my book — but still very appreciated. For businesses, durability also implies productivity gains for their IT staff, so it’s money right there. In the end, it is not the performance that makes the Lenovo X1 Yoga unique, but the experience and its convenience. And all of this is extremely well packaged into a 14”, 2.8 lbs chassis. What’s not to like? I give the OLED X1 Yoga a 10/10 — that’s the one I recommend getting, but the IPS is great too. Filed in Computers.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 28 September 2016 | MYT 2:00 PM German carmakers and technology firms form 5G telecoms association Striking back: Audi is one of the carmakers collaborating to build technology expertise to take on rivals like Uber and Google. Pictured is the Audi Q2 car at the 86th International Motor Show in Geneva, Switzerland. — Reuters FRANKFURT: German car makers Audi, BMW and Daimler launched an alliance with mobile telecoms network equipment firms Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia and Qualcomm to accelerate development of the infrastructure needed for self-driving cars. The pact is another example of Germany's premium carmakers collaborating to build technology expertise necessary to take on new rivals like Uber and Google which are also working on autonomous driving technology. The new alliance, branded the 5G Automotive Association, will "develop, test and promote communications solutions, support standardisation and accelerate commercial availability and global market penetration," the founders said in a statement. One of the aims of 5G, the technology standards for the next generation of much faster and more reliable mobile telecoms networks, is to enable a wide variety of devices to connect up and operate via the Internet - the "Internet of Things." Network equipment providers such as Ericsson and Nokia have said the 5G technology currently in development could be available for use as early as next year but mass-market upgrades to mobile networks are not expected until some time around 2020. A spokesman for the newly formed partnership said there were talks with several network operators to join the association, declining to give any names. Last year BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen's Audi, joined forces to buy digital map maker HERE for 2.8bil euros (RM11.59bil) from Nokia and this week will introduce a service that allows drivers to see for themselves what road conditions are like miles ahead using live data contributed by other vehicles. —  Reuters You May Be Interested Sign your name digitally in iOS Mail US is concerned over Russia blocking access to LinkedIn German minister says Facebook should be treated as a media company Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official China badminton star Lin Dan apologises for affair with model while wife was pregnant Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Senator's loyalty to Trump rewarded with attorney general nod Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot The Star's executive editor Soo Ewe Jin passes away advertisement Latest News US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins Toyota sharpens focus on electric cars through new in-house unit Most Viewed in Tech Hotlink Fast: Get 17GB of data with the new Internet pass Sign your name digitally in iOS Mail Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Toyota sharpens focus on electric cars through new in-house unit Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins Airbnb, San Francisco must work harder to resolve lawsuit: judge US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

S omewhere deep inside Dell’s R&D labs, white-coated workers have toiled day and night to splice the DNA of Dell’s Latitude and XPS families. The fruit of their labours is one of the finest ultraportables to ever see the light of day: the Dell Latitude 13 7370. As a starting point, you couldn’t ask for any better: the XPS 13 is an Ultrabook to aspire to, all carbon fibre, metal and understated design. It’s fast, light, beautiful and well-equipped in every category. The Latitude 13 7370 takes those strengths and moulds them into a more business-friendly form. Bag-friendly build quality It gets off to a great start. The base is cast from perfectly smooth, gently rounded plates of carbon fibre, while the silver metal lid of the XPS 13 has been exchanged for a less ostentatious charcoal-coloured sheet.  Build quality is excellent. Pick it up, twist it, abuse it and you’ll get nowhere: the slender lid barely budges more than a couple of millimetres, and the base flexes only once you start to exert the kind of force that would snap a lesser device. Dell says the Latitude 13 7370 is strong enough to survive the barrage of MIL-STD-810G tests, and I’m inclined to believe it. For a 13in laptop, the Latitude 13 7370 is unusually tiny. It’s easy to see how Dell’s done it, however: the “InfinityEdge” display has a bezel no more than a few millimetres wide. Short of getting rid of bezels entirely, the Latitude 13 7370 couldn’t be any smaller. Nor, at 1.12kg, could it be much lighter. This shrinking process hasn’t led to any obvious compromises, other than the position of the webcam; below the screen isn’t ideal for conference calls. The keyboard is a touch small, but this won’t be noticeable in everyday use. The Scrabble-tile keys have just enough scoop in them to grip the finger, and the feel is superlative, every key dipping down with a delicate, light action. If you’re the type that curses the fashion for touchpads with integrated buttons, you may now rejoice freely: the Dell’s touchpad has two separate buttons, which operate silently. Office-friendly display If you ruled out the XPS 13 because of its glossy screen, then Dell’s decision to equip the Latitude 13 7370 with a matte anti-glare coating will be a definite plus. Most of the pre-configured models come with a perfectly adequate Full HD display, but pushing up to the range-topping $5,579 model earns you a QHD+ 3,200 x 1,800 screen, not to mention the fastest available Core m7 and a larger 43Whr battery. The Full HD display on the model reviewed here is fine, but not amazing. Purists will rightly gripe about the dynamic contrast – if colour accuracy is key, it’s a significant downside – and there are other reasons to moan. The anti-glare coating makes images look a touch soft, and colours lack punch and vibrancy, although the peak brightness (278cd/m2) and contrast ratio (1,324:1) is decent. The overall quality is good enough for everyday office applications, but if you’ve spent time with the XPS 13’s high-DPI display, or any of Apple’s Retina displays, you’re likely to be underwhelmed. Battery-friendly CPU Eagle-eyed readers may have already spotted where the Latitude 13 7370 deviates from its XPS-branded sibling: it’s powered by Intel’s low-voltage Core M processors. This isn’t the shortcoming you might imagine. In most situations, you’re unlikely to notice the difference between these and Dell’s Core i3 or i5 laptops. Unless you subject your work laptop to heavy, extended workloads – virtualisation, video editing, that kind of thing – for the whole working day, the Core M’s ability to crank up the clock speed to deliver brief surges of power is the perfect compromise between performance and battery-friendly power consumption. Depending on your budget, you can buy yourself a Latitude 13 7370 in vPro-enabled Core m5 or m7 flavours, and take your pick of 128GB or 256GB M.2 NVMe SSDs. Whichever you choose, you’ll get 8GB of DDR3 RAM. Prices start at a considerable $4,635 and work up to around $5,579, at which point you get that upgrade to the QHD+ screen, a faster Core m7 CPU and a carbon-fibre lid. Dell sent me the Full HD Core m5 version for review, and it put in a very decent performance. A score of 22 overall in PC Pro’s benchmarks is exactly what we’d expect from a Core m5 device, and while it drops around 85% behind the Core i7 XPS 13 in the multi-tasking benchmarks, it’s a much less dramatic 35% to 40% slower in the video transcoding and image processing tests. That might sound like quite a margin, but in reality the super-quick NVMe SSD does a great job of masking the processor’s shortcomings. It was only once I’d started Photoshop CC churning through heavyweight filters that I began to miss the beefier Core i7 processor in the Dell XPS 13. Battery life is good enough to last a working day, but only if you take a full hour for lunch. In our video-rundown test, where we calibrate the screen to a brightness of 170cd/m2, the Latitude 13 7370 lasted 7hrs 6mins, which is 52mins less than the XPS 13. However, given that the XPS 13’s battery is almost 70% larger, that’s quite an impressive figure – and a good indicator of just how efficient those Core M processors are. Dell has done a great job of covering the connectivity and security side of things. The Intel Wireless-AC 8260 provides 2x2 stream 802.11ac Wi-Fi as well as Bluetooth 4.2 and NFC.  And it’s great to see that physical connectivity hasn’t fallen by the wayside. There’s a single full-sized USB 3 port, and this is backed up by microSD and two USB Type-C ports, both of which are Thunderbolt 3 capable. A micro-HDMI is present too, while a physical fingerprint reader and full-sized smart card reader round off the selection. Budget-friendly price? The Dell Latitude 13 7370 isn’t without rivals. HP’s EliteBook Folio 1020 was stratospherically expensive when it first launched, but has since dropped in price to the extent that you can find it for significantly less than Dell is charging for its machine. Then there’s the Dell XPS 13. Several folk in the  office have an XPS 13 as their business laptop, and as long as you can live without the security options of the 13 7370, it’s a cheaper, more powerful alternative. Despite this, the Latitude 13 7370 is a superb business ultraportable. It’s expensive, but once you take into account the fantastic build quality and its excellent array of features, not to mention the three years of on-site warranty, it’s by no means overpriced. If you’re looking to buy a light, portable laptop that’s purpose-built for a life in and out of the office, it gets most things right.  Related Reviews Review: HP EliteBook Folio G1 - great looks, terrible battery life Review: Asus VivoBook Pro N552VW Review: Asus Transformer Book Flip TP200SA Review: Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Tablet Review: Dell Inspiron 15 5000 2-in-1 Source: Copyright © PC & Tech Authority, nextmedia Pty Ltd Copyright © Alphr, Dennis Publishing See more about:  dell latitude 13 7370  |  laptop  |  pc  |  review  |  ultraportable   Tweet Email this Print this Feedback   Readers of this article also read...   Apple’s fancy new Mac book is $US199     Gallery: The PCs of PAX Australia 2016     Review: Seagate Barracuda Pro blows us away     Mag Lev is the zero gravity turntable of your sci-fi dreams     With Pixel, Google is barrelling headfirst into Apple’s backyard   NOTE: You must be a registered member of PC & Tech Authority to post a comment.
