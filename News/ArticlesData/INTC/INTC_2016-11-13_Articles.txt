(Kobi Gideon/GPO) YERUSHALAYIM - Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu inaugurated a new $6 billion production line at the Intel plant in Kiryat Gat on Monday. During the opening ceremony, Netanyahu told Intel employees: “The vision of the future is realized here, now. You are producing a new future. Using technology, you amplify Israel’s power. Israel is a global technological superpower. The national revolution is to do away with the periphery called Kiryat Gat, Beersheva, Afula and Yokneam. There is no south or north; we are doing away with the periphery.” The government contributed a $300 million grant to creating the new line, which employs new chip production technology. Netanyahu toured the plant together with Prime Minister’s Office Director-General Eli Gruner and National Economic Council head Prof. Avi Simhon. They met with company employees and managers and visited the clean room where chips are produced. Amir Faintuch, Intel senior vice president and representative of its global management, told Netanyahu during the visit that Israel, in which Intel has four R&D centers and a production plant, will play a key role in the strategic change the company has been undergoing recently. “At present, Intel is turning from a company specializing only in developing and producing chips to a company whose developments drive cloud-based computer centers and billions of smart, connected devices,” he said. Intel VP and Intel Israel CEO Maxine Fassberg said that Intel has invested over $17 billion in Israel and, over the next decade, is expected to purchase goods and services totaling NIS 18.7 billion in Israel.

Depending on the reviewer, the Touch Bar feature is either a gimmick or a productivity-boosting addition. As for performance, the reviews are mixed: some people are saying that a lot faster SSD and RAM make the machine super snappy and others note Intel’s Skylake chips barely push performance forward versus 2013 or later MacBook Pros. Jason Snell, Six Colors The Touch Bar delighted Snell: The Touch Bar is an animated interface through and through. Items don’t just fade in and out, but also slide smoothly back and forth. The arrow pointing from the Touch Bar to the Touch ID sensor during a request for an unlock grows and shrinks, practically begging you to put your finger down. There’s a lot more personality here than I expected. To balance out the design, the Touch Bar’s OLED screen doesn’t extend all the way to the left edge of the glass. As a result, the Touch Bar always appears inset from the rest of the keyboard. It’s a bit weird. Here’s a video of Snell’s thoughts on the Touch Bar. For those wondering, you can hit the ESC key on the Touch Bar without hitting the button itself. Tapping the corner of the Touch Bar blindly triggers an ESC key event, as you can see in John Gruber’s video below. This is great if you’d like to hit ESC without looking down at the keyboard. Jim Dalrymple, The Loop Jim discusses the RAM non-issue: To see how the new 15-inch MacBook Pro would do with audio, I opened a 40-track Logic Pro project. The song had a mix of loops, drums, and live recorded instruments. I played back the track, recorded some more guitars, added effects and did everything I would normally do with a music project. When I looked at the memory usage for Logic Pro, it was using 1GB RAM. The MacBook Pro has 16GB, so I have a lot of room before I ever have to worry about running out of memory. I know that having 16GB RAM is a concern for some people, but you could never put more than 16GB RAM in a MacBook Pro, so I don’t get the problem. Pros and other customers have been successfully using these computers for years. Just because it takes more RAM to use a Windows machine effectively, that doesn’t mean the same thing for a Mac. You have to look at the entire picture, hardware, software, system software, and memory optimizations. Unlike some other reviewers, Jim does not think that the Touch Bar is a gimmick. Most of us are so engrained in our workflow that we do things without even thinking about. However, when you do think to check the Touch Bar, you can see how things can be done simpler and easier. Here’s a small example. Have you ever opened the calculator app and had to choose to type in the numbers or click with the mouse? No matter what you do, it’s a pain just because of the type of app it is. With Touch Bar, all of the calculator functions are in the Touch Bar, directly above the numbers on the keyboard. This is clearly so much easier. There are a lot of examples like this with Apple’s apps and there will be many more when third-party developers add support for Touch Bar in the next few months. Touch Bar is cool, but let’s not neglect Touch ID. When the system wants your password to make changes, or delete an app, you can just place your finger on the Touch ID sensor and you’re done. The same can be done in System Preferences when making changes. It’s so much quicker than typing in your password. It’s a small thing, but it all matters. Susie Ochs, Macworld Susie was impressed with the more powerful speakers. What isn’t a bummer are the new speakers, my favorite non-Touch Bar feature of the new machines. Apple explained that since they are connected right to the battery with no transformer between them, the speakers can get twice the peak power—and you can really hear the difference. Music sounds great when you turn the volume all the way up, and the speakers are powerful enough to provide satisfying sound while watching movies, TV, and sports. The 15-inch model’s speakers seem to have more oomph than the 13-incher’s, but both can ably fill a hotel room with music, if you should want to leave your portable Bluetooth speaker at home. Her hands-on video is available at the source link. I’m not embedding it here due to Macworld’s ill-practice of auto-starting videos in the background. Should you buy the new Pro now or later? These new MacBook Pros have a lot going for them. Their biggest weakness, across the whole Touch Bar line, is price. These prices could come down a little bit next generation, but if you need a MacBook Pro right now, the late 2016 models are solid performers. If I were buying one for myself, I’d go with the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and max out the storage, although the 15-inch model is even better. Or simply wait (if you can) until prices of the new Pros inevitably fall next year as Apple refreshes them around Intel’s Kaby Lake chips. Walt Mossberg, The Verge WSJ’s former technology columnist took his 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar for a spin, deciding that the notebook that was once mainly aimed straight at people who do especially taxing work like professional video editing or serious design is “now being stretched to suit a much larger audience.” He experienced some problems with the inconsistent battery life: On my rigorous test, which I’ve used for years, the machine actually exceeded Apple’s claim of up to 10 hours of battery life. The test involves setting the screen at 100 percent, keeping it on and undimmed constantly, playing an endless loop of music, and leaving Wi-Fi on to collect email, tweets, and Facebook posts in the background. Result: 11 hours and 38 minutes. I ran a second test with all of Apple’s default energy-saving settings on, the screen at 75 percent and a perfectly normal (for me) mix of tasks like web browsing, email, a few short videos, Twitter, Facebook, some light writing, and Slack. The Pro died at 8 hours and 22 minutes. To make things worse, Apple’s built-in prediction of how much time the battery had left before dying fluctuated a lot and was mostly wrong. According to Mossberg, Apple says this is a known problem caused by the fact that modern processors can power up and down rapidly over a much wider range than in the past, making estimates much more difficult. In conclusion, he wrote: The new 13” MacBooks—even the base model without the Touch Bar—are costly. And they may make pros unhappy. But, for everyday Mac lovers—users of the Air or maybe the older low-end Pro—they are now your only thin, modern, option with a full-fledged processor. The Touch Bar has potential, but it’s not magic. The battery isn’t likely to deliver on Apple’s claims. You can’t count on liking the keyboard. But, if you’re a Mac devotee ready to move past the Air—not back to a lower-powered MacBook—this is what Apple is offering. Take it or leave it. The new MacBook Pro is a “fast, slim tweener,” wrote Mossberg. Joanna Stern, The Wall Street Journal Even with the faster chips and new hardware features like the Touch Bar and Touch ID, you’ll get the same performance and battery as in the older model, notes WSJ. So how do you decide? Do you invest in the present—the “old” MacBook Pro with performance, good-enough portability, a keyboard to cherish and lots of ports? Or do you invest in the future—a beautiful, highly portable machine with new tricks? Or maybe you do what I’m doing: Stare down at your three-year-old laptop and wonder if you can tough it out another year or two while this sorts itself out. Here’s her video hands-on. Brian Heater, TechCrunch Brian likes the speed bump provided by faster chips, SSD and RAM, saying these features make the new MacBook Pros worthy upgrades, “particularly for those who have been suffering through their old system’s death rattles (or fan buzzing, at least), waiting for a significant update” from Apple. Better processors, more storage, a brighter display and better speakers are all wrapped up in a sleeker and lighter package than before. The Touch Bar feels like a nice bonus for the time being. It’s a compelling new input device that has the potential to alter the way we interact with applications on a laptop. In conclusion, the author wrote: For those who have been holding out on buying a new MacBook, the time is right, with an upgrade that should be sufficiently future-proof to take on the next few years — or however long it takes for the next major upgrade. Hopefully you’ve been saving up in the meantime. Brian X. Chen, The New York Times Brian calls the new MacBook Pros light and fast—“probably powerful enough for most professionals”—but notes these machines aren’t for everyone because the Touch Bar so far “feels gimmicky” and “not many devices or accessories come with USB-C connectors yet.” One thing is sure: For casual users or anyone buying their first laptop, who may just want a computer for web browsing and lightweight apps, the MacBook Pro is overkill. So if you aren’t ready to make the jump to USB-C and you don’t want to spend a big chunk of your savings, it’s reasonable to wait for the new Apple notebooks to realize their potential or drop in price. Dan Ackerman, CNET Dan thinks Apple’s new mainstream MacBook Pro is going to be liked by a whole lot of new customers. On the downside, he notes that the Touch Bar itself “isn’t a must-have” right now. In his opinion, the 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar is likely going to be the default mainstream choice for price-sensitive consumers. While the five percent of the laptop buyers who consider themselves true creative professionals may take various issues with the machine, the remaining 95 percent should see it as a compelling choice. It’s far and away Apple’s most-advanced laptop. The touchpad has double the surface area of the previous model, it’s about as light as a MacBook Air but much thinner (14.9mm versus 18mm), and the flatter butterfly style keyboard has been subtly tweaked to work better here than it does in the 12-inch MacBook. Andrew Cunningham, Ars Technica Andrew notes that folks who use their notebook connected to an external display most of the time with its lid closed won’t have much use for the Touch Bar shortcuts. If it’s being used as a desktop with an external keyboard a significant amount of the time, the Touch Bar does nothing for you. When I went out of my way to use Apple’s apps, I liked the Touch Bar a lot. It just takes one or two useful buttons—creating a new tab in Safari, looking up a main page in Terminal, changing font sizes or creating checklists in Notes—to make you glad the Touch Bar is there. However, a typical day for me is spent mostly in Word, Outlook, Slack, Tweetbot, and Chrome. Microsoft is bringing Touch Bar support to Office, but if other app makers don’t start adding in support, a big chunk of that bar is going to end up sitting empty most of the time. Moving on to graphics, Apple states that the discreet Polaris-based AMD chip (Radeon Pro 450, Radeon Pro 455 and built-to-order Radeon Pro 460) inside the new Pro can drive up to four 4K external displays at 60 Hz simultaneously or two 5K displays at 60 Hz simultaneously (alongside the built-in screen). This is possible thanks to a technique called Multi-Stream Transport (MST) which permits the machine to push two DisplayPort 1.2 streams to the monitor over the single Thunderbolt 3 cable. When you hook one of LG’s 5K monitors to one of the new MacBook Pros, what you’re actually seeing on the screen is two pictures stitched together to make a single seamless image. This is because the version of the DisplayPort specification supported by Intel’s GPUs and almost all monitors these days—version 1.2—doesn’t have enough bandwidth to drive a 5K display at 60Hz all by itself. There’s nothing wrong with this method, except that it cuts down on the number of external displays your computer can support. Intel’s integrated GPUs can drive a total of three displays, but you use up two of those three streams to drive one 5K monitor and one of them to drive the laptop’s internal display. AMD’s GPUs support up to six displays, so you can use two of those connections for one 5K monitor, two of them for the other 5K monitor, one for the laptop’s internal display, and still have one left over for yet another monitor if you really wanted to use one. Switching from Intel’s integrated Iris Pro graphics in favor of dedicated AMD GPUs has resulted in significant graphics performance improvements over previous models, Andrew observes. In his tests, the mid-range 2.7GHz 15-inch MacBook Pro model with AMD’s built-in Radeon Pro 455 graphics chip showed a “significant boost” over this year’s revised twelve-inch MacBook and older 2012-2015 MacBook Pros dedicated GPUs (Nvidia’s built-to-order GeForce GTX 650M and GeForce GTX 750M, plus AMD’s Radeon R9 M370X). Omg the flip side, the new Pros lack the oomph required for high-end gaming and VR. Is it disappointing that Apple didn’t decide to push the envelope a little more? Sure. Is it too bad that performance and power efficiency were apparently sacrificed in the name of external display support? Yes. Are these midrange GPUs in any way inconsistent with any MacBook Pro released in the last decade? No. Here’s how the new Pro scored in the GFXbench synthetic GPU benchmark. Apple says that the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch ID has 130 percent faster graphics and up to 2.5x more computing power per watt versus the previous-generation 15-incher, but keep in mind that Apple’s numbers are based on AMD’s built-to-order Radeon Pro 460 chip. Andrew doesn’t think Apple should have used Nvidia’s Pascal-based GPUs instead of AMD’s even though Nvidia chips do provide support for the latest DisplayPort 1.3 specification. That’s because Thunderbolt 3 and external displays currently max out at DisplayPort 1.2 and are yet to implement support for DisplayPort 1.3. Apple will have more flexibility again when DisplayPort 1.3 becomes more common. Those future laptops will be able to drive two 5K screens plus a laptop’s internal screen using just three DisplayPort streams instead of five. For now, though, if pushing two high-end 5K screens at once was a design goal for Apple, AMD was the only way to go. Fun fact: Pascal GPUs from Nvidia cannot drive dual 5K displays via MST. Does he recommend buying the new Pro? If you’ve got a MacBook Pro that you bought in 2012 or earlier and if you’re convinced of the potential utility and novelty of the Touch Bar, these 2016 MacBook Pros were just about worth the wait. Replace a four- or five-year-old laptop with one of these and you’ll get a great new design, a respectable performance boost, a nice screen, the single most versatile port you can get in any computer, and a new input device…The main problem at this point isn’t that the Touch Bar is a bad idea, but that these laptops cost a whole bunch of money. Great, premium PC laptops are available for half this price, even if Apple still maintains an edge when it comes to graphics and SSD speeds. It really feels like the Touch Bar needs to be included in the $1,499 model, and that versions of the new designs without Touch Bars should be the entry level systems—right now, Apple’s entry-level Mac laptops were all released in mid 2015, and that’s only going to get more embarrassing as time moves on. Lance Ulanoff, Mashable On the removal of all the legacy ports from the new Pro and the Dongle Hell: Removing all those ports was certainly a risky move for Apple, but, in truth, the most you could fault them for is maybe leaping a little too far into the future. Apple is not the only company adopting USB-C. It’s a standard, after all, and just like USB spelled the end of the line for parallel and serial ports, USB-C will eventually be the port to rule all ports, and those peripherals you’re clinging to will someday, in the not too distant future, be deemed too slow or feature-poor to keep you competitive. Is “Dongle Hell” a real thing? In the short term, yes. In the long term, a single multipurpose port will always be the winner. src=&#8221;http://mashable.com/videos/embed?video=qBSPfJH2&#038;player=offsite&#8221; width=&#8217;593&#8242; height=&#8217;333&#8242; Lance criticizes the new Pros as being a bit on the expensive side, but they’re still “an excellent upgrade with a fascinating and highly extensible new Touch Bar.” Dana Wollman, Engadget I’m one of many Mac owners out there who has been waiting for Apple to upgrade the MacBook Pro line. Now that it finally has, I find the new laptop isn’t quite what I wanted. For me, the ideal MacBook Pro is actually a mashup between this and last year’s model. She disliked the fact that some system controls are buried within Touch Bar menus: What’s annoying about this whole setup is that either way, some of the most important system controls are now buried in Touch Bar menus. Want to lower the volume? You can either hit the volume icon and hit the slider, or hit the arrow key and tap the volume up or down key. That’s less efficient than just pressing a dedicated volume button in the function row. It’s inconvenient enough that I eventually started using my mouse to do things like pause Spotify or raise the volume on a track. Apple made me change my way of doing things, and not necessarily for the better. That pisses me off. Touch ID and a thinner design are nice, but she wants her ports back. There’s lots to like about the new MacBook Pro: its slimmed-down design, brighter screen, improved audio, faster graphics and disk speeds. But by doing things like removing full-sized USB ports, the memory card reader and even the Function row, Apple seems to forgotten how many of us actually work. An even better MacBook Pro would be one that doesn’t require users to make “drastic changes to their workflow,” she says. Then, of course, there would be no progress if Apple didn’t challenge the status quo. Christina Warren, Gizmodo To Christina, the new MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar is currently a gimmick that’s not worth the money until more third-party applications support it. It’s somewhat useful, but it’s still so undersupported for apps beyond Apple’s that, at least for right now, the Touch Bar is not reason enough to get a new MacBook Pro. Particularly if you’re already satisfied with the performance of your existing machine. If you need a new MacBook Pro and you can’t wait for the Kaby Lake refreshes already rumored, the benefits of the internal specs matched with the cool-factor of the Touch Bar make this a good Mac. For everyone else this is a gimmick on a very good, way too expensive laptop. Third-party support for the Touch Bar is sparse but growing. Expect apps focused on design and coding to adopt first. My favorite Touch Bar app so far is 1Password, largely because it uses the Touch Bar and Touch ID. I really hope Google chooses to support the Touch Bar. It could be very useful, especially with extensions. On the other hand, she totally loves Touch ID and thinks it’s an “awesome” addition to the Mac, but is also  ”bummed” about the lack of a rose gold color option. Dongle Hell? To use your old peripherals, you’ll be in dongle hell for the short term, but the 4 Thunderbolt 3 ports at least give lots of connectivity options for the future. As for the performance, her review states that both the base 13-inch model without Touch Bar and the base 15-inch model with Touch Bar were performant across Gizmodo’s benchmarks. Christina offered a word of advice to would-be buyers: “If you’re getting the 13-inch, consider spending the extra $200 on 16GB of RAM now, since you cannot upgrade later.” Harry McCracken, FastCo Beyond the svelter design, Touch Bar, and new ports, the new MacBook Pros shows multiple refinements that, on their own, wouldn’t prompt anyone to splurge on a new computer. They just make that new computer better once you have it, and are the sort of improvements that Apple never gets enough credit for making. The MacBook Pro’s high-resolution Retina display would have been one of the biggest reasons to upgrade from a MacBook Air no matter what. But it’s also brighter than previous screens—at full blast, it makes my eyeballs tingle—offers better contrast, and has a wider color gamut for more accurate reproduction of photos. Edward C. Baig, USA Today Edward likes using Touch ID to get into the computer and approve purchases. He’s not too concerned about the removal of legacy ports in favor of USB-C. In fact, USB-S, he writes, at least gives consumers more choices in terms of the chargers. You can use pretty much any USB-C charger to juice up your Mac, though if you try a cellphone charger as I did, it might not charge quite as fast as using the supplied USB-C power adapter, which incidentally replaces the old MacSafe adapter. He’s a fan of the redesigned speaker system that Apple says provides twice the dynamic range of earlier MacBook Pros (“What I can say is that the speakers are loud and crisp, and the overall audio quality is excellent”) and likes the new low-profile keyboard: I never fully cozied up to the “butterfly” style Qwerty keyboard on Apple’s MacBook notebook and was worried when I first learned that the MacBook Pro keyboard was based on the same technology. But the refined second-generation butterfly mechanism used here represents a marked improvement. The keys are responsive. I felt perfectly comfortable, for instance, typing this column out on the keyboard. Like many other reviewers, he balked at the MacBook Pro’s high price which makes the powerful notebook pricier than it’s ever been before and out of reach of many notebook buyers like myself. Chris Davies, Slashgear In dropping almost all legacy ports in favor of Thunderbolt 3, ignoring the Windows 10 style of touchscreen in favor of supplementary Touch Bar and adopting the low-profile butterfly keyboard, Apple has created a pretty “contentious machine,” Chris writes. In his opinion, Apple has not really forgotten the “professional” in recreating the MacBook Pro as other commenters have claimed before him. Has Apple forgotten the professionals which are arguably its most vocal advocates? I don’t think that’s true, though I do suspect that group now finds itself at the fringe of MacBook Pro users. Such is the side-effect of a user group in general expanding. Like Touch ID, the Touch Bar as a brand new hardware feature is currently in infancy and will need some time to take off and realize its potential in full: Ergonomically, I’m among those still content with a non-touch primary display. My experience with the Touch Bar, meanwhile, has left me mighty curious to see what comes next as third-party developers get to grips with the potential of the added interface. Right now, a large part of its usefulness is in replicating keyboard shortcuts: that’s handy if you’re unfamiliar with them, but it’s no great surprise that longtime Mac users have been less wowed. The new MacBook Pros have huge trackpads, but Chris saw no issues resting his hand on them due to flawless palm rejection. All that extra room makes macOS gestures easier, and there’s less swipe-and-lift involved in general navigation. I was a little worried about palm-rejection, given the size of the trackpad means there’s a reasonable chance some part of your hand or wrist might be resting on it at times, but Apple’s improved algorithms there have seemingly done the trick, and I’ve not noticed any issues. The sheer size of the trackpad makes him wish that Apple had added Pencil compatibility for repurposing the trackpad as a graphics tablet. Now, that’s a clever idea!

Other Ars staffers who saw the Touch Bar were impressed that it had the same amount of color and detail as any old Retina display. Andrew Cunningham Buttons have, by and large, been replaced by sliders. Andrew Cunningham Customizing the Touch Bar buttons in software. The new design of the MacBook Pros is nice, and Apple’s decision to put in nothing but Thunderbolt 3 ports has prompted a fresh wave of dongle talk, but the signature feature of the new MacBook Pros was always going to be the Touch Bar. This little touch-enabled strip represents a bunch of things. It’s a melding of Apple’s traditional Intel-driven software platform and the company’s own homegrown chips and its touch-driven iOS platform. It’s Apple’s answer to the touchscreen, a model that Apple steadfastly resists in its computers even as Microsoft and its partners embrace it. And it's the biggest thing about these Macs that’s truly new—Macs in the last half-decade have gotten thinner and lighter and have better battery life than before, but, Touch Bar aside, they all still run basically the same software in basically the same way. So, yes, these new laptops have new CPUs and GPUs, new designs, new ports, and new screens. We’ll spend plenty of time with all of those things. But the biggest question for buyers is whether the Touch Bar is worth it and what it adds to the experience that you can’t already get if you keep the latest version of macOS installed on your laptop. Differences between all three MacBook Pros Specs at a glance: 13-inch 2016 Apple MacBook Pro (Four Thunderbolt 3 ports) Screen 2560×1600 at 13.3" (227 PPI) OS OS X 10.12.1 Sierra CPU 2.9GHz Intel Core i5-6267U (Turbo up to 3.3GHz) RAM 8GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 (soldered, upgradeable to 16GB at purchase) GPU Intel Iris 550 (integrated, 64MB eDRAM) HDD 256GB PCIe 3.0 x4 solid-state drive Networking 1.3Gbps 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2 Ports 2x Thunderbolt 3, 2x Thunderbolt 3 with reduced bandwidth, headphones Size 11.97" × 8.36" × 0.59" (304.1 mm × 212.4 mm × 14.9 mm) Weight 3.02 lbs (1.37 kg) Battery 49.2Whr Warranty 1 year Starting price $1,799.99 Price as reviewed $1,799.99 Other perks 720p webcam, backlit keyboard, three integrated mics We've been over this a few times, but let's list the differences between the $1,499 MacBook Pro and the Touch Bar model. There are a couple of new details I can confirm now that I’ve actually been able to use both models. The low-end Pro uses a 15W Core i5-6360U CPU with an Intel Iris 540 GPU; the high-end model uses a 28W Core i5-6267U CPU with an Intel Iris 550 GPU. The difference, aside from small boosts to CPU and GPU clock speeds, is that the 28W model can run faster for longer and throttle less frequently. The 15W model can also consume less power. The low-end Pro uses a single “Alpine Ridge” Thunderbolt 3 controller from Intel, while the high-end Pro uses two Thunderbolt controllers. The two ports on the right side of the MacBook Pro have "reduced PCI Express bandwidth," which Apple says means they have two PCIe 3.0 lanes’ worth of bandwidth at their disposal instead of the four lanes dedicated to the ports on the left side (Intel’s mobile Skylake chipsets include a total of 10 PCIe lanes, four of which are already being used by the SSD). You can connect all the same things to both ports—displays, storage, power adapters—but especially high-performance storage arrays should be plugged in on the left side to maximize the available bandwidth. The low-end Pro uses 1866MHz LPDDR3 RAM while the high-end Pro uses 2133MHz LPDDR3. Apple has said it’s using LPDDR3 to save power, but it’s also the reason the systems max out at 16GB. The low-end Pro actually has a larger battery than the high-end one: 54.5Whr compared to 49.2Whr. Apple says both laptops have 10 hours of battery life, but the lower-power processor, the larger battery, and the lack of a little second screen above the keyboard all mean that the low-end model actually lasts a bit longer than the Touch Bar model. The low-end model includes two integrated mics, while the high-end model includes three. The low-end Pro’s 802.11ac Wi-Fi tops out at 867Mbps, while both the Touch Bar MacBook Pros can do a maximum of 1.3Gbps just like last year’s models. And here are a few further differences between both 13-inch models and the 15-inch models, all of which include Touch Bars. 15-inch Pros have enough thermal headroom to fit in quad-core Skylake processors. The base model includes a 2.6GHz (3.5GHz Turbo) Core i7-6700HQ, while our review unit uses a 2.7GHz (3.6GHz Turbo) Core i7-6820HQ. Either model can be configured with a 2.9GHz (3.8GHz Turbo) Core i7-6920HQ. All models use their processors’ Intel HD 530 integrated graphics when possible to save power, but they also include dedicated AMD Radeon GPUs. The Radeon Pro 450, 455, and 460 are all based on AMD’s latest Polaris architecture—we’ll go into more detail about each component later in the review. The trackpad in the 15-inch model is larger than in the 13-inch models. All four Thunderbolt 3 ports in the 15-inch Pros offer the same amount of PCIe bandwidth, since Intel’s quad-core CPUs add more PCIe 3.0 lanes to the amount that the chipset includes (in total, Apple is using four lanes for the SSD, eight lanes across all four Thunderbolt 3 ports, and another eight lanes for the dedicated GPUs). Using the 15-inch model Specs at a glance: 15-inch 2016 Apple MacBook Pro Screen 2880×1800 at 15.4" (220 PPI) OS OS X 10.12.1 Sierra CPU 2.7GHz Intel Core i7-6820HQ (Turbo up to 3.6GHz) RAM 16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 (soldered) GPU AMD Radeon Pro 455 with 2GB RAM, Intel HD 530 HDD 512GB PCIe 3.0 x4 solid-state drive Networking 1.3Gbps 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2 Ports 4x Thunderbolt 3, headphones Size 13.75" × 9.48" × 0.61" (349.3 mm × 240.7 mm × 15.5 mm) Weight 4.02 lbs (1.83 kg) Battery 76.0Whr Warranty 1 year Starting price $2,399.99 Price as reviewed $2,799.99 Other perks 720p webcam, backlit keyboard, three integrated mics The reduced size and weight of the 15-inch Pro are both really nice when you’re carrying the machine around. At just four pounds, it actually weighs less than the 4.5 pound 13-inch MacBook Pros did before the jump to Retina, and it’s a pound-and-a-half lighter than the pre-Retina 15-inch models (there’s a less consequential but still nice half-pound reduction compared to the older Retina models). When you're using it, though, it’s still very much a 15-inch laptop. I use 13-inch laptops almost exclusively these days, and the more cumbersome size and larger palmrest make the 15-inch models just a little unwieldy compared to what I’m used to. In other words, even with the size and weight decreases, the 15-inch model isn't small enough to be a good replacement for a 13-inch notebook. I will say that my minor palm rejection problems with the 13-inch Pro’s larger trackpad aren’t really problems here. It may be because the trackpad is larger, so the corners of my hands are always firmly placed on the trackpad as I type rather than hitting it intermittently. Beyond this, the experience of typing and of using the trackpad is identical. The 2880×1800 screen has the same resolution as the older Retina models, albeit with the added brightness and contrast and the wide color support. But like the MacBook and the 13-inch Pros, the screen’s default resolution is 1680×1050 mode. As with the previous models, you can also select 1024×600, 1280×800, 1440×900, and 1900×1200 modes depending on what’s the most comfortable for you. Finally, the speakers here are much larger than the ones in the 13-inch model, and they sound pretty good for laptop speakers. They have respectable bass and dynamic range. While they aren’t as good as the speakers in a desktop like an iMac or some good dedicated speakers, they’re good enough for movies and TV, and they aren’t bad if you need to fill a room with music for a small party.

Ilia Mirkin Takes To Hacking On SWR Gallium3D, Fixes ~600 Piglit Bugs Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 14 November 2016 at 11:16 AM EST. 23 Comments Ilia Mirkin, the prolific independent contributor to Mesa who started off on improvements to the Nouveau open-source NVIDIA driver a few years ago and has also contributed to Freedreno, has now turned to Intel's SWR Gallium3D software rasterizer as his latest target. Mirkin remains one of the most prolific open-source contributors to Mesa not associated with any of the companies like AMD, Intel, Collabora, etc but just working on Mesa and the open-source Linux graphics stack in his spare time. With this patch series published over the weekend, Mirkin has 14 patches lined up affecting several hundred lines of code in the SWR Gallium3D software rasterizer. The patches improve texture resource manipulation and redoes the surface layout for the SWR driver. The patches also prep for other potential performance improvements. The good news from these patches alone is that they fix around 600 Piglit tests!

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Report: unlocked Kaby Lake Core i3 CPU may be on the way by Wayne Manion  12:00 AM on November 14, 2016 Intel has historically been at best ambivalent when it comes to allowing overclocking of its low-end and mid-range CPUs. The golden days of Celeron 300A CPUs being overclocked to near-performance-equivalence with the Pentium III 450 are in the distant past. The only throwback to that time that the silicon giant has offered in the last decade was the multiplier-unlocked Pentium G3258 from mid-2014. That situation could change, if rumors that sprung up over the weekend about an unlocked Core i3 CPU prove true. A price list posted by online vendor ShopBLT suggests the existence of a Core i3-7350K CPU based on Intel's latest 14-nm seventh-generation Core "Kaby Lake" architecture. Notorious rumor mill website WCCFTech goes on to speculate that this CPU will have an unlocked multiplier and support for Intel's Turbo Boost feature, something that up until now hasn't been offered in Core i3 processors. The anticipated i3-7350K will allegedly pack two cores with Hyper-threading, backed up by 4MB of on-die cache. The leak says the factory base clock speed will be 4.0GHz, and can use Turbo Boost to reach 4.2GHz. This information isn't completely surprising, however. Back in August, Jeff had a little chat with Intel's Dan Ragland, who sort-of-alluded to a value-oriented overclockable chip. Kaby Lake's improved process technology and resulting clock headroom seem like a good basis for an overclockable CPU, too. WCCFTech claims contradictory TDP specifications of 61W and 91W for the dual-core chip. The site offered no information with respect to integrated graphics, but we would be shocked if the Core i3-7350K lacked Kaby Lake's more efficient graphics architecture with hardware support for H.265 video. WCCFTech's SKU list also lists several other Core i3 models with Turbo Boost. Similarly, the rumor mongers suggest simultaneous multi-threading is spreading from Intel's Core CPU line to a pair of Pentium SKUs, the Pentium G4600 and G4620. The ShopBLT listing pegs the Core i3-7350K at $177. That price is closer to the current cheapest unlocked Intel CPU, the $242 Core i5-6600K, than it is to the Pentium G3258's introductory price of $72.

The 15-inch MacBook Pro hooked up to some external 5K displays. Andrew Cunningham The 15-inch Pro and the 13-inch Touch Bar model. Andrew Cunningham The new Pro comes in both space gray and silver. Andrew Cunningham The glowing Apple logo on the back is no more. Andrew Cunningham The new 15-inch model has a big trackpad and big speaker grilles to the left and right of the keyboard. Andrew Cunningham The Touch Bar models have four Thunderbolt 3 ports, unlike the $1,499 model. Andrew Cunningham The Touch Bar displaying emoji. Other Ars staffers who saw the Touch Bar were impressed that it had the same amount of color and detail as any old Retina display. Andrew Cunningham Buttons have, by and large, been replaced by sliders. Andrew Cunningham Customizing the Touch Bar buttons in software. The new design of the MacBook Pros is nice, and Apple’s decision to put in nothing but Thunderbolt 3 ports has prompted a fresh wave of dongle talk, but the signature feature of the new MacBook Pros was always going to be the Touch Bar. This little touch-enabled strip represents a bunch of things. It’s a melding of Apple’s traditional Intel-driven software platform and the company’s own homegrown chips and its touch-driven iOS platform. It’s Apple’s answer to the touchscreen, a model that Apple steadfastly resists in its computers even as Microsoft and its partners embrace it. And it's the biggest thing about these Macs that’s truly new—Macs in the last half-decade have gotten thinner and lighter and have better battery life than before, but, Touch Bar aside, they all still run basically the same software in basically the same way. So, yes, these new laptops have new CPUs and GPUs, new designs, new ports, and new screens. We’ll spend plenty of time with all of those things. But the biggest question for buyers is whether the Touch Bar is worth it and what it adds to the experience that you can’t already get if you keep the latest version of macOS installed on your laptop. Differences between all three MacBook Pros Specs at a glance: 13-inch 2016 Apple MacBook Pro (Four Thunderbolt 3 ports) Screen 2560×1600 at 13.3" (227 PPI) OS OS X 10.12.1 Sierra CPU 2.9GHz Intel Core i5-6267U (Turbo up to 3.3GHz) RAM 8GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 (soldered, upgradeable to 16GB at purchase) GPU Intel Iris 550 (integrated, 64MB eDRAM) HDD 256GB PCIe 3.0 x4 solid-state drive Networking 1.3Gbps 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2 Ports 2x Thunderbolt 3, 2x Thunderbolt 3 with reduced bandwidth, headphones Size 11.97" × 8.36" × 0.59" (304.1 mm × 212.4 mm × 14.9 mm) Weight 3.02 lbs (1.37 kg) Battery 49.2Whr Warranty 1 year Starting price $1,799.99 Price as reviewed $1,799.99 Other perks 720p webcam, backlit keyboard, three integrated mics We've been over this a few times, but let's list the differences between the $1,499 MacBook Pro and the Touch Bar model. There are a couple of new details I can confirm now that I’ve actually been able to use both models. The low-end Pro uses a 15W Core i5-6360U CPU with an Intel Iris 540 GPU; the high-end model uses a 28W Core i5-6267U CPU with an Intel Iris 550 GPU. The difference, aside from small boosts to CPU and GPU clock speeds, is that the 28W model can run faster for longer and throttle less frequently. The 15W model can also consume less power. The low-end Pro uses a single “Alpine Ridge” Thunderbolt 3 controller from Intel, while the high-end Pro uses two Thunderbolt controllers. The two ports on the right side of the MacBook Pro have "reduced PCI Express bandwidth," which Apple says means they have two PCIe 3.0 lanes’ worth of bandwidth at their disposal instead of the four lanes dedicated to the ports on the left side (Intel’s mobile Skylake chipsets include a total of 10 PCIe lanes, four of which are already being used by the SSD). You can connect all the same things to both ports—displays, storage, power adapters—but especially high-performance storage arrays should be plugged in on the left side to maximize the available bandwidth. The low-end Pro uses 1866MHz LPDDR3 RAM while the high-end Pro uses 2133MHz LPDDR3. Apple has said it’s using LPDDR3 to save power, but it’s also the reason the systems max out at 16GB. The low-end Pro actually has a larger battery than the high-end one: 54.5Whr compared to 49.2Whr. Apple says both laptops have 10 hours of battery life, but the lower-power processor, the larger battery, and the lack of a little second screen above the keyboard all mean that the low-end model actually lasts a bit longer than the Touch Bar model. The low-end model includes two integrated mics, while the high-end model includes three. The low-end Pro’s 802.11ac Wi-Fi tops out at 867Mbps, while both the Touch Bar MacBook Pros can do a maximum of 1.3Gbps just like last year’s models. And here are a few further differences between both 13-inch models and the 15-inch models, all of which include Touch Bars. 15-inch Pros have enough thermal headroom to fit in quad-core Skylake processors. The base model includes a 2.6GHz (3.5GHz Turbo) Core i7-6700HQ, while our review unit uses a 2.7GHz (3.6GHz Turbo) Core i7-6820HQ. Either model can be configured with a 2.9GHz (3.8GHz Turbo) Core i7-6920HQ. All models use their processors’ Intel HD 530 integrated graphics when possible to save power, but they also include dedicated AMD Radeon GPUs. The Radeon Pro 450, 455, and 460 are all based on AMD’s latest Polaris architecture—we’ll go into more detail about each component later in the review. The trackpad in the 15-inch model is larger than in the 13-inch models. All four Thunderbolt 3 ports in the 15-inch Pros offer the same amount of PCIe bandwidth, since Intel’s quad-core CPUs add more PCIe 3.0 lanes to the amount that the chipset includes (in total, Apple is using four lanes for the SSD, eight lanes across all four Thunderbolt 3 ports, and another eight lanes for the dedicated GPUs). Using the 15-inch model Specs at a glance: 15-inch 2016 Apple MacBook Pro Screen 2880×1800 at 15.4" (220 PPI) OS OS X 10.12.1 Sierra CPU 2.7GHz Intel Core i7-6820HQ (Turbo up to 3.6GHz) RAM 16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 (soldered) GPU AMD Radeon Pro 455 with 2GB RAM, Intel HD 530 HDD 512GB PCIe 3.0 x4 solid-state drive Networking 1.3Gbps 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2 Ports 4x Thunderbolt 3, headphones Size 13.75" × 9.48" × 0.61" (349.3 mm × 240.7 mm × 15.5 mm) Weight 4.02 lbs (1.83 kg) Battery 76.0Whr Warranty 1 year Starting price $2,399.99 Price as reviewed $2,799.99 Other perks 720p webcam, backlit keyboard, three integrated mics The reduced size and weight of the 15-inch Pro are both really nice when you’re carrying the machine around. At just four pounds, it actually weighs less than the 4.5 pound 13-inch MacBook Pros did before the jump to Retina, and it’s a pound-and-a-half lighter than the pre-Retina 15-inch models (there’s a less consequential but still nice half-pound reduction compared to the older Retina models). When you're using it, though, it’s still very much a 15-inch laptop. I use 13-inch laptops almost exclusively these days, and the more cumbersome size and larger palmrest make the 15-inch models just a little unwieldy compared to what I’m used to. In other words, even with the size and weight decreases, the 15-inch model isn't small enough to be a good replacement for a 13-inch notebook. I will say that my minor palm rejection problems with the 13-inch Pro’s larger trackpad aren’t really problems here. It may be because the trackpad is larger, so the corners of my hands are always firmly placed on the trackpad as I type rather than hitting it intermittently. Beyond this, the experience of typing and of using the trackpad is identical. The 2880×1800 screen has the same resolution as the older Retina models, albeit with the added brightness and contrast and the wide color support. But like the MacBook and the 13-inch Pros, the screen’s default resolution is 1680×1050 mode. As with the previous models, you can also select 1024×600, 1280×800, 1440×900, and 1900×1200 modes depending on what’s the most comfortable for you. Finally, the speakers here are much larger than the ones in the 13-inch model, and they sound pretty good for laptop speakers. They have respectable bass and dynamic range. While they aren’t as good as the speakers in a desktop like an iMac or some good dedicated speakers, they’re good enough for movies and TV, and they aren’t bad if you need to fill a room with music for a small party.

Mesa 13.0.1 Is Out for Linux with Improvements for Intel & Radeon Vulkan Drivers GO The GLX GLVND driver received some fixes as well Nov 14, 2016 14:50 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  After informing us last week about the availability of the Release Candidate (RC) version of the first point release of Mesa 13.0.0, as well as about Mesa 13.0.1's upcoming launch on November 13, 2016, Collabora's Emil Velikov released the final version today. As noted in our previous report, Mesa 13.0.1 3D Graphics Library is here with a large number of improvements for both Intel and Radeon Vulkan drivers, thus enhancing our gaming experience once again. For the Intel ANV Vulkan driver, it looks like it adds up to 30 percent performance increase. On the other hand, the latest RADV improvements allow you to install and use the Radeon Vulkan driver outside the /usr/lib directory on a Linux-based operating system, which is possible because of the implementation of distinctly named JSON files that contain the full path of the Vulkan driver. "Up-to 30% performance increase using the Intel ANV Vulkan driver. The Radeon RADV Vulkan driver now ships with distinctly named json files, which include the full Vulkan driver path. Making it possible for people to install and use the drivers outside their /usr/lib directory," wrote Emil Velikov, Software Release Engineer at Collabora. More RADV improvements, GLX GLVND driver fixes But that's not all that was implemented in today's Mesa 13.0.1 3D Graphics Library release, as we can notice even more Radeon Vulkan driver improvements, such as the ability to correctly advertise support for the Xlib platform extension, which finally lets users use RADV alongside the open-source Dolphin GameCube and Wii emulator. The handling of XCB and Xlib connections was improved as well, for both Intel and Radeon Vulkan drivers, allowing them to advertise the correct versions of their supported extensions. On top of that, Mesa 13.0.1 promises lots of enhancements to the GLX GLVND driver. Last but not least, it re-implements the interoperability between Mesa's libEGL and libGL libraries and third-party OpenCL implementations. Below, we've attached the full changelog for the tech-savvy reader curious to know what exactly was fixed or added in Mesa 13.0.1, whose source archive is available for download right now from our website.

Picture: Stuart McEvoy Supratim Adhikari The Australian 12:00AM November 15, 2016 Save Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on email Share more... Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Whatsapp Print this articleX Supratim Adhikari Technology Editor Melbourne @SupratimA The McAfee brand is about to start flying solo again after a hiatus of six years and the man in charge of leading the reinvigorated entity, Chris Young, is confident it has the chops to become the leader of the pack when it comes to ­securing the internet. Mr Young’s new gig comes courtesy of a $US1.1 billion ($1.45bn) deal, sealed in September, between US semiconductor giant Intel and private equity heavyweight TPG Capital, in which TPG will take a 51 per cent stake in Intel Security and run it as a new independent company, McAfee. The deal values the security business about $US4.2bn, including debt. Intel retains a 49 per cent stake in the new entity. It also brings things full circle for the tech giant, which paid $US7.6bn in cash to buy the ­McAfee business in 2010. It wasn’t the best bit of business by Intel and while the cybersecurity space has evolved a lot in the past six years Mr Young said a lot of the foundational work done during the ­period would now bear fruit under TPG’s ownership. “There’s a ton of security in everything that Intel does and the company has invested a lot of money into building the foundation technology elements of our product portfolio,” Mr Young told The Australian. Intel has invested over $US500 million over the past year in the security business, revamping its solutions portfolio and opening up its Data Exchange Layer (DXL) security communications fabric to share threat intelligence. “This new future for the security business gives us the opportunity to really focus on the space with a new energy and we will be able to do the things we want to do without any distractions,” Mr Young said. That new focus would be geared towards giving enterprise users a unified platform, eliminating the need for them to deal with multiple vendors and to manage multiple security solutions. “The tagline for the new brand is together is power and we are putting our money where our mouth is when it comes to bringing together the disparate pieces of our customer’s security infrastructure,” Mr Young said. He said another big advantage Mc­Afee would look to leverage was the global scale of the ­company. “We will be one of the largest in the marketplace with nearly 8000 people globally; there are 1400 vendors in the market and less than two or three are even close to that size,” he said. “Most of the industry is very point-product oriented but we have taken a more solutions-­oriented approach where we don’t go after specific issues but bring automated use-case driven workflows to bear.” McAfee is betting customers will see the advantage of moving away from tackling the three points of the threat defence life cycle — protect, detect and correct. Companies rely on specific products that are designed to do either one or some of those three things but Mr Young says customers are better served by a single layer that allows organisations to seamlessly co-ordinate all three components. “As vendors, it’s up to us to create solutions that reduce the burdens on individuals that operate the security apparatuses of our customers,” Mr Young said. It’s not every day you get the chance to push the limits of a trusted and well-known brand like McAfee and Mr Young said the timing could not be better to challenge the status quo. “Security has moved from the backroom to the boardroom. It’s now a fundamental topic for our society and it’s a massive change in the way we think about the problem,” he said. “As security professionals, we need to continuously challenge our own assumptions.” With physical crime now manifest over the digital world, Mr Young said organisations were starting to lift their game on understanding the value of the data but emergent trends like the Internet of Things would pose a new complexity. “Most of us in the industry have said for some time that IoT will increase the attack surface,” he said. “One of the ways to mitigating high volume attacks has to be the use of machines to detect attacks, but one of the big challenges with IoT is the heterogeneity of devices. “So there’s still a lot of work that needs to be done.” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on email Share more...

HEXUS did a thorough review of this budget OC-capable chip and gave it a coveted 'Editor's Choice' award due to its strong value, performance, and overclockability. That 2C/2T chip still sells but is getting rather long in the tooth... Now rumours / leaks suggest that Intel is preparing a new affordable OC champ within the slightly higher end (from a Pentium) Core i3 Kaby Lake desktop range. This story features on several sites today with not one providing sources but WCCF Tech appears to have published the earliest and has a convincing looking Intel inventory screengrab (see below). So let's gather together all the details so far spilled about the next gen overclockable i3. The Intel Core i3-7350K will run with a maximum boost frequency of 4.2GHz out of the box. This unlocked multiplier 'K' chip will be a dual-core part with four threads (2C/4T). An L3 cache of 4MB will help speed processing along. The TDP of the i3-7350K will be 91W, says one report, matching the 'K' models from both Kaby Lake i5 and i7 desktop ranges. Crucial to the Intel Core i3-7350K's popularity will be its pricing. Yes, it looks set to be the most expensive new Core i3 but it's still a significant chunk cheaper than a multiplier locked 4C/4T Core i5 and allows enthusiasts to indulge in fully flexible OC shenanigans. The i3-7350K's price is expected to be below $180. Another interesting budget-minded member of the new Kaby Lake range, if far-east sourced leaks last month were correct, will be the first Pentium to feature Hyperthreading. The Intel Pentium G4620 reputedly features a 3.7GHz clock speed and 2C/4T. Are these lower-end unlocked and hyperthreading enhanced parts Intel's foot soldiers to combat AMD Zen in the popular sub-$200 and sub-$100 markets next year?

OTH,the Core i5 7400 for around £190 looks comparatively better IMHO OFC. The Pentium G4260 looks a better prospect - at under £100. If the pound were not so weak,it would be an £80 CPU. Posted by cheesemp - Mon 14 Nov 2016 14:30 CAT-THE-FIFTH OTH,the Core i5 7400 for around £190 looks comparatively better IMHO OFC. Agreed. This is like a Corsa ‘sports’. Designed to appeal to someone who like the idea of fast rather than actually being fast. I'd take 4 slightly slower cores over 2 cores (with hyperthreading) any day. Its even more apparent the i5 is better idea once you factor in a decent CPU Heatsink and fan to let you overclock it in a meaningful way… Posted by CAT-THE-FIFTH - Mon 14 Nov 2016 14:54 cheesemp Agreed. This is like a Corsa ‘sports’. Designed to appeal to someone who like the idea of fast rather than actually being fast. I'd take 4 slightly slower cores over 2 cores (with hyperthreading) any day. Its even more apparent the i5 is better idea once you factor in a decent CPU Heatsink and fan to let you overclock it in a meaningful way… The G4260 looks good too. If it were not for the weak pound,that would have equated to around £80. It basically looks like a rebadged Core i3 6100 with an RRP down from $117 to $98. Interestingly enough it appears the Core i3 chips might have boost clocks,so if you enable all cores Turbo on the cheapest one it should give you a free overclock! Posted by this_is_gav - Mon 14 Nov 2016 15:03 Despite the article saying the G3258 is “long in the tooth” (which it isn't in the sense that Intel's completely stagnated), I think I'd rather pick that up at the moment given it's half the price of this (and actually can be described as a budget overclocking chip).

Andrew Cunningham Buttons have, by and large, been replaced by sliders. Andrew Cunningham Customizing the Touch Bar buttons in software. The new design of the MacBook Pros is nice, and Apple’s decision to put in nothing but Thunderbolt 3 ports has prompted a fresh wave of dongle talk, but the signature feature of the new MacBook Pros was always going to be the Touch Bar. This little touch-enabled strip represents a bunch of things. It’s a melding of Apple’s traditional Intel-driven software platform and the company’s own homegrown chips and its touch-driven iOS platform. It’s Apple’s answer to the touchscreen, a model that Apple steadfastly resists in its computers even as Microsoft and its partners embrace it. And it's the biggest thing about these Macs that’s truly new—Macs in the last half-decade have gotten thinner and lighter and have better battery life than before, but, Touch Bar aside, they all still run basically the same software in basically the same way. So, yes, these new laptops have new CPUs and GPUs, new designs, new ports, and new screens. We’ll spend plenty of time with all of those things. But the biggest question for buyers is whether the Touch Bar is worth it and what it adds to the experience that you can’t already get if you keep the latest version of macOS installed on your laptop. Differences between all three MacBook Pros Specs at a glance: 13-inch 2016 Apple MacBook Pro (Four Thunderbolt 3 ports) Screen 2560×1600 at 13.3" (227 PPI) OS OS X 10.12.1 Sierra CPU 2.9GHz Intel Core i5-6267U (Turbo up to 3.3GHz) RAM 8GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 (soldered, upgradeable to 16GB at purchase) GPU Intel Iris 550 (integrated, 64MB eDRAM) HDD 256GB PCIe 3.0 x4 solid-state drive Networking 1.3Gbps 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2 Ports 2x Thunderbolt 3, 2x Thunderbolt 3 with reduced bandwidth, headphones Size 11.97" × 8.36" × 0.59" (304.1 mm × 212.4 mm × 14.9 mm) Weight 3.02 lbs (1.37 kg) Battery 49.2Whr Warranty 1 year Starting price $1,799.99 Price as reviewed $1,799.99 Other perks 720p webcam, backlit keyboard, three integrated mics We've been over this a few times, but let's list the differences between the $1,499 MacBook Pro and the Touch Bar model. There are a couple of new details I can confirm now that I’ve actually been able to use both models. The low-end Pro uses a 15W Core i5-6360U CPU with an Intel Iris 540 GPU; the high-end model uses a 28W Core i5-6267U CPU with an Intel Iris 550 GPU. The difference, aside from small boosts to CPU and GPU clock speeds, is that the 28W model can run faster for longer and throttle less frequently. The 15W model can also consume less power. The low-end Pro uses a single “Alpine Ridge” Thunderbolt 3 controller from Intel, while the high-end Pro uses two Thunderbolt controllers. The two ports on the right side of the MacBook Pro have "reduced PCI Express bandwidth," which Apple says means they have two PCIe 3.0 lanes’ worth of bandwidth at their disposal instead of the four lanes dedicated to the ports on the left side (Intel’s mobile Skylake chipsets include a total of 10 PCIe lanes, four of which are already being used by the SSD). You can connect all the same things to both ports—displays, storage, power adapters—but especially high-performance storage arrays should be plugged in on the left side to maximize the available bandwidth. The low-end Pro uses 1866MHz LPDDR3 RAM while the high-end Pro uses 2133MHz LPDDR3. Apple has said it’s using LPDDR3 to save power, but it’s also the reason the systems max out at 16GB. The low-end Pro actually has a larger battery than the high-end one: 54.5Whr compared to 49.2Whr. Apple says both laptops have 10 hours of battery life, but the lower-power processor, the larger battery, and the lack of a little second screen above the keyboard all mean that the low-end model actually lasts a bit longer than the Touch Bar model. The low-end model includes two integrated mics, while the high-end model includes three. The low-end Pro’s 802.11ac Wi-Fi tops out at 867Mbps, while both the Touch Bar MacBook Pros can do a maximum of 1.3Gbps just like last year’s models. And here are a few further differences between both 13-inch models and the 15-inch models, all of which include Touch Bars. 15-inch Pros have enough thermal headroom to fit in quad-core Skylake processors. The base model includes a 2.6GHz (3.5GHz Turbo) Core i7-6700HQ, while our review unit uses a 2.7GHz (3.6GHz Turbo) Core i7-6820HQ. Either model can be configured with a 2.9GHz (3.8GHz Turbo) Core i7-6920HQ. All models use their processors’ Intel HD 530 integrated graphics when possible to save power, but they also include dedicated AMD Radeon GPUs. The Radeon Pro 450, 455, and 460 are all based on AMD’s latest Polaris architecture—we’ll go into more detail about each component later in the review. The trackpad in the 15-inch model is larger than in the 13-inch models. All four Thunderbolt 3 ports in the 15-inch Pros offer the same amount of PCIe bandwidth, since Intel’s quad-core CPUs add more PCIe 3.0 lanes to the amount that the chipset includes (in total, Apple is using four lanes for the SSD, eight lanes across all four Thunderbolt 3 ports, and another eight lanes for the dedicated GPUs). Using the 15-inch model Specs at a glance: 15-inch 2016 Apple MacBook Pro Screen 2880×1800 at 15.4" (220 PPI) OS OS X 10.12.1 Sierra CPU 2.7GHz Intel Core i7-6820HQ (Turbo up to 3.6GHz) RAM 16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 (soldered) GPU AMD Radeon Pro 455 with 2GB RAM, Intel HD 530 HDD 512GB PCIe 3.0 x4 solid-state drive Networking 1.3Gbps 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2 Ports 4x Thunderbolt 3, headphones Size 13.75" × 9.48" × 0.61" (349.3 mm × 240.7 mm × 15.5 mm) Weight 4.02 lbs (1.83 kg) Battery 76.0Whr Warranty 1 year Starting price $2,399.99 Price as reviewed $2,799.99 Other perks 720p webcam, backlit keyboard, three integrated mics The reduced size and weight of the 15-inch Pro are both really nice when you’re carrying the machine around. At just four pounds, it actually weighs less than the 4.5 pound 13-inch MacBook Pros did before the jump to Retina, and it’s a pound-and-a-half lighter than the pre-Retina 15-inch models (there’s a less consequential but still nice half-pound reduction compared to the older Retina models). When you're using it, though, it’s still very much a 15-inch laptop. I use 13-inch laptops almost exclusively these days, and the more cumbersome size and larger palmrest make the 15-inch models just a little unwieldy compared to what I’m used to. In other words, even with the size and weight decreases, the 15-inch model isn't small enough to be a good replacement for a 13-inch notebook. I will say that my minor palm rejection problems with the 13-inch Pro’s larger trackpad aren’t really problems here. It may be because the trackpad is larger, so the corners of my hands are always firmly placed on the trackpad as I type rather than hitting it intermittently. Beyond this, the experience of typing and of using the trackpad is identical. The 2880×1800 screen has the same resolution as the older Retina models, albeit with the added brightness and contrast and the wide color support. But like the MacBook and the 13-inch Pros, the screen’s default resolution is 1680×1050 mode. As with the previous models, you can also select 1024×600, 1280×800, 1440×900, and 1900×1200 modes depending on what’s the most comfortable for you. Finally, the speakers here are much larger than the ones in the 13-inch model, and they sound pretty good for laptop speakers. They have respectable bass and dynamic range. While they aren’t as good as the speakers in a desktop like an iMac or some good dedicated speakers, they’re good enough for movies and TV, and they aren’t bad if you need to fill a room with music for a small party.

Beloved workhorse of graphic designers, video editors, coders, and others wedded to the macOS ecosystem, any change to the MacBook Pro was going to be contentious. All the same, even stoic, self-confident Apple was seemingly rocked by the fierce reaction to features like Thunderbolt 3 and the brand new Touch Bar. Why not a full touchscreen? Why have you abandoned the legacy ports? Why make it thinner when pro-users care about power? Why aren’t the processor and graphics the very fastest, most cutting-edge? Why is memory limited to 16GB at most? Why are you forcing the MacBook’s keyboard on us? Amid it all, a common theme: Apple has forgotten the “Professional” in recreating the MacBook Pro. In a keynote filled with DJs, and family galleries in Photos, and Touch Bar access to emojis, was this new notebook no longer the machine of choice for the work-horse pro? Hardware and Design Familiar and yet different. At first glance you can’t confuse the MacBook Pro with anything else, but look closer and the differences this time around start to make themselves noticed. Biggest change for this new version is the addition of a second color, the same Space Gray as the 12-inch MacBook is offered in, alongside the original Silver. No sign of Rose Gold, however, and though Jet Black would be eye-catching, it’d also be a sea of scratches after one trip in your bag. Thickness and weight are down. The old 13-inch MacBook Pro was 3.48 pounds and 0.71-inches thick; its replacement is 3.02 pounds and 0.59-inches thick. Meanwhile the old 15-inch MacBook Pro was 4.49 pounds and 0.71-inches thick, which drops to 4.02 pounds and 0.61-inches with the new model. As has been Apple’s way for the past few generations, user-upgrades aren’t encouraged. If you get the base panel off, you’ll find processor and memory are of course soldered in. Unexpectedly, the PCIe storage is removable, but since it uses a custom SSD controller we’ll have to wait and see whether third-party suppliers will be allowed to offer replacements. Specifications and Performance In what’s become a fairly full desktop, I’ve had all three main versions of the new MacBook Pro on hand for testing. The $1,499 entry-level model, which lacks the Touch Bar, has a 2.0 GHz dual-core Core i5 and Intel Iris Graphics 540. It’s paired with 8GB of 1866 MHz LPDDR3 memory (16GB is an option) and a 256GB PCIe SSD (512GB/1TB are options). The 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has a 2.9 GHz dual-core Core i5 and Intel Iris Graphics 550, for $1,799. It’s paired with 8GB of faster, 2133 MHz LPDDR3 memory (again, 16GB is an option) and a 256GB PCIe SSD (with the same 512GB/1TB options). Both versions can be configured with Core i7 processors, up to 3.3 GHz. Finally, there’s a 15-inch MacBook Pro, with a 2.6 GHz quad-core Core i7 processor and both Intel HD Graphics 530 and AMD Radeon Pro 450 2GB graphics, priced at $2,399. It has 16GB of 2133 MHz LPDDR3 memory as standard, along with a 256GB PCIe SSD (with up to 2TB options). The fastest processor in the largest MacBook Pro is a 2.9 GHz Core i7 quad-core. Faster hardware has been top of the wishlist for MacBook Pro fans for some time, though Apple’s decisions haven’t been met with universal acclaim. Since Intel’s very latest 7th-generation “Kaby Lake” processors aren’t available in anything other than the ultra-low-voltage form Apple used in the 2016 12-inch MacBook update, and so it stuck with “Skylake”. Dual-core and quad-core “Kaby Lake” chips will arrive in 2017, Intel says, though when they might show up inside a MacBook Pro remains to be seen. The second controversy is memory. Even a fully maxed-out 15-inch MacBook Pro – which will set you back a cool $4,299 – can’t be had with more than 16GB of RAM. Whether you have 8GB or 16GB, it’s LPDDR3 not the newer, faster LPDDR4: Apple says that’s a power usage decision made in combination with using the “Skylake” chips. Benchmarks, of course, only tell part of the story, but they’re useful in contrasting between the three variations of notebook I have here. Geekbench 3’s results aren’t too surprising, though there’s clearly not a huge processing jump from going from the 2.0 GHz Core i5 dual-core to its 2.9 GHz sibling. The 15-inch’s extra cores play their hand, meanwhile, though performance on paper is still comparable to the old version. Apple has been pushing faster and faster solid-state storage in its notebooks for some generations now, and the new MacBook Pro line-up is no exception. Benchmark speeds were pretty consistent across all three models in QuickBench 4.0, hitting a hefty 2,909.2 MB/sec read and 1,571.2 MB/sec write at their fastest. Yes, Apple charges a fair amount to climb up through its SSD storage, but you can’t argue with the performance. Finally, there’s graphics. Again, Apple has come in for some criticism with its choices of GPU, specifically the discrete Radeon chips in the 15-inch MacBook Pro, which aren’t the very fastest in AMD’s line-up. All get Intel Iris graphics too, and they hold up well in the 13-inch notebooks in comparison to the outgoing model. Gains from the Radeon Pro 450 with its dedicated 2GB of memory aren’t vast; it’s worth remembering that this is the entry-level discrete GPU in Apple’s lineup. Even so, it’s a noticeable step up from the old machines. None of the new MacBook Pro models should be your first choice for graphics-intensive gaming – nothing new there – and those looking for the very fastest mobile GPU performance will still need to look to Windows notebooks, but all three are capable when it comes to video rendering, CAD and graphic design, and other such tasks. Display and Speakers Apple has stuck with its Retina-class resolution on both the 13-inch and 15-inch notebooks, the smaller using a 2560 x 1600 panel and the larger a 2880 x 1800 panel. Because of the way those screens work – by default, at least – you get a smoother 1440 x 900 on the 13-inch and 1680 x 1050 on the 15-inch. What’s new this time around is brightness, contrast, and color quality. For a start, brightness has climbed from 300 nits of the old model to 500 nits on the new. That means outdoor visibility is significantly improved, as well as screen legibility when dealing with reflections. The contrast ratio improvement helps too, now at 1,500:1 versus the 900:1 of the old LCD. Finally, there’s support for the DCI-P3 color space, which Apple has made such a big deal of in the recent iMac 5K and iPhone 7. In short, it means 25-percent more visible colors than with the old model, though reds and greens benefit particularly. Of course, you’ll also need DCI-P3 compliant images to actually tell the difference: luckily, the iPhone 7 shoots them, while if your standalone digital camera doesn’t produce them with its in-camera JPEG rendering, you can always edit them from RAW. Of course, many people prefer to use an external display, and that’s covered too. Courtesy of Thunderbolt 3 – more on which in the next section – you can drive as many as two 5K screens from the 15-inch MacBook Pro. The 13-inch isn’t quite as powerful, but can still handle a single 5K display or two 4K displays. Right now, native Thunderbolt 3 displays aren’t especially common, and Apple hasn’t replaced the discontinued Thunderbolt Display with a new version. Instead, it’s pushing LG’s UltraFine 5K and 4K screens, at 27- and 21.5-inches, which are $974 and $524 respectively until the end of the year. Unfortunately I’ve not been able to test them out yet. Apple is particularly proud of the speakers on the new MacBook Pros, boasting of twice the dynamic range. They definitely sound better than the system on the old notebook, particularly in the case of the 15-inch which has a surprising amount of power to fill a room. Part of the difference, I’m told, is that the speaker system is wired directly into the system power now, for triple the peak power of the old approach which used an intermediary converter. Physics only lets you get away with so much, of course, and while things sound balanced across the frequency range at low to medium volume, the bass starts to get overshadowed by treble and upper-mids at the upper end of the range. Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C If the processor, memory, and graphics decisions Apple made are the internal cause of the new MacBook Pro furore, the choice to ditch almost all of the legacy ports is the external trigger. Gone is MagSafe 2, and USB 3.1, and Thunderbolt 2, and HDMI, and the SD card slot. In there place, you have Thunderbolt 3 using the USB Type-C connector. The entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro – the one without the Touch Bar – gets two such ports. Any Touch Bar-equipped model doubles that to four. The 3.5mm headphone jack lingers on the right edge, quietly taunting iPhone 7 owners. Few disagree that Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C is the port of the future. Its advantage is its speed and flexibility: one single cable can deliver power, data, and display signals all at the same time. It’s fast, with up to 40 Gbit/sec data rates on paper at least, and backward compatible with USB 3.1 gen 2 (which maxes out at 10 Gbit/sec). Like Lightning, there’s no “right side up” and you can plug it in either way. Unusually, it’s bidirectional: the same port that one moment was drawing power from a hub, can the next minute be supplying power to an external hard-drive or other peripheral. In short, Apple fans would’ve been livid had Apple not included it on the new MacBook Pro. Instead, they’re just furious that Apple has embraced Thunderbolt 3 so enthusiastically. While it may be compatible with many of the ports we’ve grown used to over the past years, that requires adapters and dongles. Need to plug in a USB Type-A device? You’ll need a dongle. Want to connect your HDMI TV, or your VGA projector? You’ll need a dongle. Need a port for wired ethernet? You guessed it, you need a dongle. I’m a 12-inch MacBook user and have been since the first-gen model in early 2015. I mention that to make it clear that I’ve been living the USB-C-only lifestyle for some time now, and with just a single port. Along the way I’ve found some of the frustrations I expected to be less significant than I thought they’d be, and vice-versa. Adapters have become a part of my daily life. Most commonly, that’s because I need to import photos and videos from the SD card in my camera; I have a small card reader and Apple’s USB Type-A to Type-C dongle in my bag. Unplugged, the latter can be used to read USB drives, or connect to scanners or non-wireless printers. Would it be great to be able to plug everything in natively? Sure, though I think I thought something along the same lines back when floppy drives and CD drives and DVD drives rose and fell in popularity. Even the previous MacBook Pro with Retina display, which many are looking at with renewed fondness now, demanded I carry a Thunderbolt 2 ethernet adapter just-in-case. Personally, when it comes to adopting Thunderbolt 3 wholeheartedly I suspect Apple would’ve been damned if they did and damned if they didn’t. This commitment to the USB Type-C connector is exactly what the port needs for peripheral and accessory makers to take the transition seriously: I think we’ll see more USB-C devices, at a faster rate, as a result. Had Apple just switched the Thunderbolt 2 ports on the old MacBook Pro to Thunderbolt 3, and left the legacy connectors in place, we’d be complaining that the new standard was slow to gain traction. All the same, Apple could’ve handled this transition better. The fact that you’re paying upwards of $1.5k for a notebook and don’t get a USB Type-A to Type-C adapter in the box seems miserly: sure, Apple sells them now for nine bucks apiece, but it’s galling nonetheless. We’re yet to see a compelling USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 hub from the Cupertino firm either; I’ve been carrying Huawei’s, but reports from the Wild West of third-party options, many of which prove to be compromised in any number of ways, show the confusion Apple has dumped its users into. I suspect Apple has held off from addressing that situation because it expects it to go away in time. That’s probably true. All the same, right now for every moment of pleasure at plugging in a single 5K Thunderbolt 3 display and also having your MacBook Pro powered and hooked up to a row of extra ports for data, there’s the sting of “hang on, where’s my Type-A connector gone?” frustration. Touch Bar As someone who has used macOS for a reasonable number of years now, my fingers have picked up a fair few shortcuts along the way. Some, like command+S for save, or command+T for a new tab, or command+F for find have become second nature: my fingers punch them out before my brain consciously thinks about them. Ironically, it’s that which makes touchscreen notebooks less functional for me, since it’s quicker to hit a key combination than it is to reach up, tap the display, and then bring my hand back down again. My first inclination was to force myself to stop using shortcuts and rely on the Touch Bar instead. That’s harder than it first sounds, I discovered, not to mention fairly unproductive. Just like setting up your iOS home screen, or choosing what apps to have in your macOS dock, it pays to spend a few minutes customizing the Touch Bar before you wade in. That’s usually done in each individual app, where you get a selection of buttons you can drag down into the bar, or conversely drag those icons already present out. There’s also a global setting for the default shortcuts which is accessed in the System Preferences. It’d be more convenient if you could see every Touch Bar layout from there, for each different app, but right now you have to switch between apps individually. What surprised me was how quickly I got into the habit of using the Touch Bar, at least for certain tasks. Having switched back to Apple’s Mail app – I’d usually rely on Gmail’s browser interface, which also supports keyboard shortcuts – I found myself reaching up to stab the “Send” button on the Touch Bar alongside the escape key more often than not. In the Calendar app, being able to sweep through the weeks via the Touch Bar proved quicker than clicking through. Some of Apple’s more eye-catching demos are those that, ironically, don’t work so well on the Touch Bar. Picking out emojis is fine if you’re looking for one you frequently use – as on iOS, they’re clustered at the start of the list – but actually going hunting for something different requires a whole lot of swiping. It’s much easier to hit control+command+space and choose (or search) from there. Similarly, autocomplete when generally typing makes a lot less sense on a notebook than it does on an iPhone or iPad. At times, it can actually be less convenient than the regular buttons were. In Spotify, for instance, shortcuts for media control are now two taps away – first you touch to expand the Control Strip of core commands, and then you can hit play/pause or skip tracks – though that’s likely to become less of an issue as more developers add support. I’ve used the Touch Bar more than I thought I did, though there are clearly some areas where improvement could be made. Some will presumably be addressed in time, like third-party apps which don’t interact with the OLED strip at all. Others, though, depend on Apple choosing to embrace flexibility. Right now, for instance, there’s no way to assign macros to a Touch Bar button. You can’t have a single button that automatically starts a new email and populates the To: box with preset recipients, or that creates a Pages document with certain styles and sections. I have Automator workflows set up to convert different image or document formats to JPEGs, but I can’t assign them to the Touch Bar: all I have is Apple’s selection of pre-approved buttons to choose between. The company tells me that it can’t comment on what future integration might be added down the line. A small handful of third-party apps will have Touch Bar support at launch – Apple says that includes Day One, Coda, and Pixelmator – while others, like Sketch, Photoshop, djay Pro, and OmniGraffle will be updated by the end of the year. Microsoft has committed to Touch Bar support in Office, Outlook, and Skype, while utilities like 1Password will also embrace the finger-strip. That’s fine if you live in standalone software, but plenty of our time is now spent in web apps. Unfortunately, while Apple has APIs for standalone software, apps that live in the browser don’t get to play. Similarly, there was a conscious decision made not to allow notifications to break into the Touch Bar in any way: you can’t have pop-up alerts on there, like a ticker tape machine, and nor can you interact with shortcuts in macOS notifications like delete or reply. Overall, though, I’m curious to see how the Touch Bar fares once more people get their fingers on it. After you let go of the idea that it’s a baby-step toward a full touch display, and instead a third type of interface alongside keyboard and trackpad, it becomes a case of finding the moment it suddenly chimes with how you use macOS. If you really decide you don’t like it, meanwhile, you can set the Touch Bar to only show the function keys by default. Holding down the “Fn” button brings those old-school keys up temporarily, too. Touch ID Apple’s fingerprint sensor technology has at last made the jump from iOS to macOS, and it does much the same as the home button on the iPhone and iPad does today. Register your fingertip – up to five can be stored, though only at most three per user account – and tapping the square to the right of the Touch Bar will unlock your Mac and log you in. If you have more than one account set up, fingerprints can be used to switch between them. Again, as on the iPhone, you can optionally use Touch ID to authenticate payments using Apple Pay, and purchases through iTunes and the App Store. If you set up locked notes, Touch ID can be used to unlock them again. APIs for third-party developers will mean other software should be able to do similar things down the line, though right now I couldn’t find anything else which allowed me to log in via fingerprint. It’s one of those things that, after you’ve lived with it for a brief time, it’s jarring to go back to passwords. I’m in the habit of locking my Mac whenever I leave it: with Touch ID it’s less than a second and I’m back into the system – you don’t even have to wake the screen separately first; just tapping the scanner takes you straight to whatever you were working on last – in contrast to having to punch in a password multiple times a day. Apple has a new chip – the Apple T1 – which it uses to store fingerprint data and payment information securely. It’s actually a surprisingly clever little chunk of silicon, in some ways more akin to a smartwatch than anything else, but the key element is the Secure Enclave. That’s what encrypts your fingerprints and card information, tokenizing it rather than sharing it with apps and web-based stores. The Touch ID square is actually a button, though you don’t have to actually press it for your fingerprint to register, just rest it on top. Hold it down and it acts as a physical power button – it’s also how you can restart in the case of a system crash – though you rarely have to use it. Just opening the lid of the notebook boots/resumes it. In the process, Apple also removed the startup tone. I’m not entirely sure why that has prompted such an outpouring of sentiment, perhaps it’s port requiem overspill. Keyboard and Force Touch trackpad It’s not just down to the Thunderbolt 3 switch that helped Apple make the new MacBook Pro thinner: the “butterfly mechanism” keyboard played a part, too. It also triggered a few groans from those familiar with – but not a fan of – the keyboard on the 12-inch MacBook, which was Apple’s first play with the new mechanism. Happily for those skeptics, things are a little different second time around. Though I’m personally a fan of the MacBook keyboard, I can understand why some people struggle with it. Though the company points out that each individual key is more stable, travel is much reduced in comparison to Apple’s old ‘board. That takes some getting used to. On the MacBook Pro, travel is the same half-millimeter but the underlying dome switch is different. That may not sound like much, but it gives the keys far more “pop” as you strike them: it actually feels like they’re moving more than they really are. Side by side with the 12-inch MacBook, it’s a noticeable improvement. Just as the keycaps are larger on the new MacBook Pro, so the Force Touch trackpads have grown. On the 13-inch models it’s now around 6.25-inches diagonal; the 15-inch is even bigger, at a vast 7.25-inches. As we’ve seen before, they provide the sensation of a click even though it’s actually simulated – you can choose between light, medium, and firm sensations in the settings – which takes a little getting used to at first, but quickly becomes second nature. All that extra room makes macOS gestures easier, and there’s less swipe-and-lift involved in general navigation. I was a little worried about palm-rejection, given the size of the trackpad means there’s a reasonable chance some part of your hand or wrist might be resting on it at times, but Apple’s improved algorithms there have seemingly done the trick, and I’ve not noticed any issues. Its sheer size does make me wish that Apple had added Pencil compatibility for repurposing the trackpad as a graphics tablet. Battery After all the changes, Apple’s commitment to a promised 10 hours of battery life is one of the few carry-overs from the old MacBook Pro. That’s 10 hours of wireless web browsing, mind, or iTunes movie playback, both at 75-percent brightness. Actual battery size varies of course, though it’s interesting to note that, because it doesn’t have the Touch Bar to accommodate, the entry-level 13-inch has a slightly larger battery than its more expensive but identically-sized sibling. My own testing suggests that 10 hour figure is pretty accurate, and even too conservative by an hour or so. It’s very dependent on not only how much you’re stressing the system but what apps you’re using, however. If you’re a Safari user then you’re going to see much better results than if you prefer Chrome, for instance. Even if you’re just browsing, it can mean the difference of a couple of hours. Push things harder, such as doing 4K video processing, and you’ll spend far less time away from the outlet. It took 11 minutes for iMovie to export a 10 minute 4K video on the 15-inch MacBook Pro, for instance. During that time, the battery dropped by 10-percent. As for recharging, Apple supplies a 65W adapter with the 13-inch MacBook Pro, while the larger model gets an 87W adapter. There’s no extension cable – it plugs directly into your outlet – though you can buy one separately, and there aren’t the flip-out arms to wrap the cable around, either. Other USB Type-C devices, like Google’s Pixel phones, are happy to recharge from them too. Wrap-Up Has Apple forgotten the professionals which are arguably its most vocal advocates? I don’t think that’s true, though I do suspect that group now finds itself at the fringe of MacBook Pro users. Such is the side-effect of a user group in general expanding. Ergonomically, I’m among those still content with a non-touch primary display. My experience with the Touch Bar, meanwhile, has left me mighty curious to see what comes next as third-party developers get to grips with the potential of the added interface. Right now, a large part of its usefulness is in replicating keyboard shortcuts: that’s handy if you’re unfamiliar with them, but it’s no great surprise that longtime Mac users have been less wowed. That doesn’t mean there’s not plenty of potential for a small, full-color display that leaves your primary screen uncluttered and allows you to manipulate tools with one hand while you use the trackpad with the other. Just as Thunderbolt 3 needs time to gain traction, so the Touch Bar is dependent on third-party support and imagination to really come into its own. Life on the cutting edge is, inevitably, something of a gamble as you wait for everyone else to catch up. I can’t help but imagine a 2017 MacBook Pro with Kaby Lake processors and several months of developers getting to grips with the potential of Touch ID and the Touch Bar. As it stands today, though, the dongle frustration and the fact that you really need to pay $1799 or more – the entry-level 13-inch misses out too much, in my opinion, to be worth considering – are outweighed by the improvements in graphics, the excellent build quality, and the promise its unique hardware coupled with macOS represents.

Highs Light, but solid Unique, attractive design Great display options, up to QHD+ Strong, well-rounded performance Solid battery life Lows Quiet speakers DT Editors' Rating 10 DT Editors' Choice Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Laptop Reviews > Dell XPS 13 review (Kaby Lake) By Brad Bourque Posted on 11.10.16 Research Center: Dell XPS 13 (Kaby Lake) Dell’s XPS 13 has been a favorite laptop at Digital Trends since its revitalized debut in early 2015. The original won our Editors’ Choice award, impressing us with its excellent battery life, beautiful display, and slim dimensions. Now, with the release of Intel’s new seventh-generation Core processors, the XPS 13 has received yet another internal update. Our two new review models both pack the latest Intel chips into a rose gold finish that’s as trendy as it is eye-catching. Both configurations are significantly more than the $800 base model, but the low base price means the upgraded versions are still competitive with other high-end laptops. Our latest units were $1,149 and $1,649 for a Core i5 and i7 more, respectively. That includes a $50 charge for the new rose gold finish. So, does Dell’s XPS 13 still rule the ultrabook roost? Or have new alternatives like the HP Spectre x360 and Asus’ Zenbook 3 stolen the show? Small, yet big Opening the Dell XPS 13 immediately reveals its most prominent design trait: a barely-there display bezel. The gaps between the edges of the screen and the edges of the lid are less than a quarter of an inch thick, which means this notebook comes closer to a true “edge-to-edge” display than the competition. They also help the XPS stay small, as it’s only one foot wide and eight inches deep. That’s half an inch narrower than the new MacBook Pro 13. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Such compact dimensions may raise durability concerns, but touching this Dell crushes them without hesitation. The carbon fiber and aluminum chassis feels rigid. Even the thin-bezel display allows only the slightest flex. We feel confident the XPS 13 will handle abuse better than most systems of its size. The exterior of the standard, silver XPS 13 is mundane with the display lid closed. Dell could have done more to differentiate the system at a glance from the Inspiron 7000 series, which also relies on silver metallic accents. Dell’s gold and rose gold models resolve that issue with a subtle change of color. Once open, both models reveal a uniquely textured, soft-touch carbon fiber interior that steals the show. No other laptop looks or feels quite like this. USB 3.0 dominates, but USB Type-C 3.1 is included Wired connectivity is adequate. It offers two USB ports, both 3.0, along with a Thunderbolt 3/USB 3.1 Type-C port, which handles video and additional peripheral connections. The Dell includes a proprietary charger and charging port, but the Type-C port can be used to charge if you have a compatible charger lying around. An SD card reader and an audio jack are also included. There’s no Ethernet or HDMI – you’ll need adapters for those. You may not need Ethernet, though, because the base XPS 13 comes standard with 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0. Still one of the best Windows touchpads The small size of XPS 13 doesn’t mean the keyboard is rubbish. On the contrary, individual keys provide solid feel with reasonable travel and a firm bottoming action. A ton of space between individual keys leads to our only complaints. The key caps could be larger, and Backspace is too small. Still, it’s a top-notch effort overall, which makes maximum use of the minimal chassis. Upgrades like the 3,200 x 1,800 panel, and classy rose gold finish, only sweeten the system. Keyboard backlighting is standard. By default, it turns on only when the system is actively in use. Just two brightness levels are available, and a great deal of light escapes from beneath the keys, which can be distracting. A third, even dimmer setting would be preferable. We can’t praise the touchpad highly enough. Four inches wide, and a hair more than two inches deep, it’s not particularly large, but what it lacks in size it makes up for in fluidity. Multi-touch scroll and zoom feel wonderful, almost Mac-like, and we never had an issue with mistaken or unwanted input. The tactile left and right buttons integrated into the touchpad lack travel, but it hardly matters because tap-to-click works so well. Pleasing pixels The standard XPS 13 comes with a 1080p display, which was featured in the Core i5-7200U unit, while the Core i7-7500U version has a 3,200 × 1,800 touchscreen. That’s about 280 pixels per inch for the higher-end model, or 60 more per inch than a MacBook Pro. Predictably, that makes for a sharp viewing experience. While the display can’t do native 4K, there is a noticeable bump in image quality when viewing 1440p or 4K content. The 1080p model we recently reviewed had a non-touch matte surface, with a maximum brightness of 259 lux. That is less than most competitors, but the non-gloss surface makes the minimal backlight useable in almost all conditions. Its contrast reached 970:1 with the brightness all the way up, coming in ahead of the competition, but just barely. Color accuracy wasn’t as strong, at 2.65 – once again, not the worst reading, but with some room for improvement. Gamma was way off at 2.7, which means images appear darker than they should, with lost detail in the shadows. More: HP Spectre review The glossy 3,200 x 1,800 QHD+ display fared a bit better. Its 279 lux maximum brightness still doesn’t reach the 350 range which we see on most high-end displays, but will suffice for most use cases. Contrast is slightly lower than the 1080p model, at just 780:1 with the brightness all the way up, which falls further from the 900-1000 range we’re used to seeing. Its 2.0 gamma is a bit bright, but forgivable, seeing as even strong panels often fall just outside the ideal perfect range. Both displays look good, but in different ways. The matte-screen 1080p model is a better choice if you read or write frequently on your laptop, as the high contrast and non-gloss surface help documents pop. Movies and games look alright, but the poor gamma performance does obscure detail, leading to muddy scenes in some situations. The glossy, QHD+ display is the opposite. It’s not the best choice if you’re looking to read a document on a plane, as the mirror-like finish becomes annoying. But it does look more vibrant when displaying entertainment, espically when the laptop is viewed in a dim or dark room. There’s also a 1080p glossy model available on some models. We didn’t test it this time around, but we have in the past. Its performance is like the QHD+ version, so it’s a good choice if you want an entry-level XPS 13, and intend to use it to watch movies or edit photos. Audio performance is a flaw. The speakers don’t sound terrible, but they can’t output enough volume to fill a room with sound. External speakers or headphones are a necessity. Not the quickest, but quick enough We’ve reviewed a handful of XPS 13 configurations over the past two years, and the newest additions are the seventh-generation Intel options in rose gold. The higher-end model packs in the Core i7-7500U, while the more modest version has a Core i5-7200U. The seventh-generation focus wasn’t on performance, so the modest speed improvements aren’t too surprising. The Asus Zenbook 3 with the same chip beats the Core i7-7500U equipped XPS 13 in our Geekbench CPU test, but not by much. Importantly, both XPS 13 models take a lead over the previous generation’s top-end gold version with a Core i7-6560U. Our real-world CPU benchmark is more favorable to the Dells. Both the new XPS 13 models take a strong lead in our 4K video conversion test, even over other systems with stronger Geekbench scores. They’re only beaten by the previously mentioned Core i7 XPS 13. For some reason, our Core i5 model also beat out the Core i7 model, which is likely a thermal oddity. We’ve reached out to Dell and will update this post as more information becomes clear. Go with PCIe PCIe SSDs have become the standard in high-end laptops, and it’s no different here. The newest XPS 13 models boasted sustained read speeds of 1,285 megabytes per second, and sustained writes of 573MB/s. The XPS 13 is in league with the fastest, running neck-and-neck with Razer’s Blade Stealth and Apple’s MacBook. Competitors like the Toshiba Satellite Radius 12, which has a SATA hard drive, struggle to offer half the XPS 13’s read performance. Of course, you can order the lower-end XPS 13 with a SATA hard drive, but the move to a 256GB PCIe SSD is sure to make a difference. Let’s not play games Despite Intel’s best efforts to provide gaming-ready integrated graphics, it becomes clearer with every generation that they just aren’t cut out for it. The Core i7-7500U model of XPS 13 achieves a Fire Strike score of 882, better than most of its competitors, but not exactly an impressive score in the grand scheme of things. Meanwhile, the previous generation’s XPS 13 with a Core i7-6560U scores a slightly more palatable 1,271, thanks to its late-generation CPU with Iris graphics. The Core i5-7200U model performs very similarly in terms of graphical performance. Both chips are equipped with Intel HD graphics which, again, aren’t our favorite. They’ll be fine for some light Counter-Strike, or maybe even World of Warcraft if you aren’t too picky about quality settings, but that’s about it. Then again, you won’t often see systems this small, or inexpensive, with dedicated graphics. Dell XPS 13 (Kaby Lake) Compared To Toshiba Portege Z30-C1310 Asus ZenBook UX305 Toshiba Kirabook (2014) Asus Zenbook UX301LA HP Envy x2 Dell XPS 13 Dell XPS 12 ASUS Zenbook Prime UX32VD Sony Vaio S Premium 13.3-inch Lenovo ThinkPad X230 Toshiba Portege Z835 Asus U36Jc Sharp M4000 Toshiba Dynabook SX Sony VAIO C1MW PictureBook All day endurance The XPS 13 starts at 2.7 pounds, and the high-resolution touchscreen increases that figure to a still-light 2.9 pounds. That’s slightly heavier than other laptops in its weight class, such as the HP Spectre and Zenbook 3, but whether you’ll notice half a pound or not is up for debate. Though physical small, the Dell feels chunky in-hand. That’s an effect of the thin bezels. The XPS 13 is much smaller than other laptops sporting a 13-inch display, and thus denser. Despite how it feels, it’s one of the smallest and lightest 13-inch systems overall, and will easily fit in any backpack or bag designed to carry a typical laptop. Multi-touch gestures are smooth and accurate thanks to the brilliant touchpad. Battery life is strong. Dell has increased the capacity of the battery with each iteration, and it’s now up to 60 watt-hours. That’s among the largest batteries in any 13-inch laptop. Most are at 50 watt-hours, or less. In the Peacekeeper battery benchmark, the Core i7-7500U version of the XPS 13 lasted five hours and seven minutes. Our web browsing loop extended life to six hours and ten minutes. Our video test loop went even better, reaching just over nine hours on a single charge. That’s enough to cover a flight or a mixed load workday, but it falls short of systems like the Zenbook 3 and Spectre x360, largely due to a higher-resolution panel and more powerful CPU. The Core i5 model offers more endurance. The Peacekeeper browser test, for example, lasted six hours and 12 minutes – over an hour longer than the Core i7 version. In addition, that result bests all the competitors we’ve reviewed including the Asus Zenbook 3, HP Spectre, and Acer Swift 7. The lesson? While the 3,200 x 1,800 display is slick, you should stick with the 1080p model if battery life is your main concern. Warranty Dell ships the XPS 13 with its standard one-year “enhanced support” warranty. This is essentially the same warranty you’d expect to receive from any laptop. While it’d be nice to see a longer warranty given this model’s price, we can’t knock the company; few competitors bother to offer more than a year. Our Take Though this year’s updates aren’t the most exciting, Dell builds on an already successful computer with the revised Dell XPS 13. It remains our favorite laptop. Is there a better alternative? The thin and light laptop space has become even more crowded in the last year, but the XPS 13 still stands out as one of the best laptops in the category. The Zenbook 3 has made a splash, but its value isn’t as strong as the XPS 13, and it has a finicky keyboard. The Ideapad 710’s a nice machine as well, but lags behind the XPS in terms of performance and display. The DT Accessory Pack Logitech M510 Wireless Mouse $19.99 Anker Dual Display Universal Docking Station $94.99 Acer R240HY Monitor $119.99 Cyber Acoustics USB Powered Speaker $15.63 HP’s reimagined Spectre line has also challenged the XPS 13’s superiority, with the extremely thin Spectre 13 and convertible Spectre x360. They’re priced competitively too, and offer a solid alternative with a slick look. However, the Dell XPS 13 has a wider range of display options and more attractive, more portable design. How long will it last? Dell’s newest XPS 13 model checks off almost everything on our list for a future-proof laptop. It has Thunderbolt 3, plus two USB Type-A for legacy support, screen options over 1080p, the latest generation of Intel processors, a sturdy design, and a large battery. Should you buy it? Yes. If you’re looking for a new laptop, the Dell XPS 13 is our favorite laptop overall, and you’d be remiss to not at least consider it. The base models offers good value around for the price, and upgrades like the 3,200 x 1,800 panel and classy rose gold finish only sweeten the pot. The HP Spectre is probably the next best thing, if Dell’s offering isn’t quite doing it for you. The Spectre x360, specifically, provides a 360-degree hinge, while the Dell’s touchscreen only leans back so far. Otherwise, it’s easy to see the XPS 13 is the laptop of choice for most users.

Flash or disk, flash or disk. Let's do both – Seagate Portable drive, 5TB capacity. Hmm, there's something fishy here Profile Dani Golan stands on the roof of his Israeli headquarters and points out features of the scenery: an 8,000 year-old ruin here, an ancient trade route there, a modern highway alongside the building, a sign to Nazareth, and fighter jets taking off from a nearby airforce base with thunderous, sky-filling roars. Dani is founder and CEO of all-flash array firm Kaminari, and our guide to this portion of a press trip to look at Israeli startups. Golan founded Kaminario with Moshe Selfin and Ofir Dubovi in 2008 to make an all-DRAM grid-in-a-box array. It didn't take off, so they bailed out and switched to an all-flash array instead. Selfin was vice president for marketing and products, and left in August 2010 for Anobit, the flash controller company bought by Apple. He is now COO of Credorax. Dubovi was COO and CFO, and left in October 2012, and Golan became sole leader of Kaminario. Israeli rules ban photos showing pilot's faces with planes. So here is a silhouette of someone in an F16. Dani had been an IDF fighter pilot, one of the elite, flying his IAI Kfir jet or an F16 and managing missions. He didn't fly his jet from the air base near Kaminario's office, but every jet taking off from there will trigger memories of his 1990-1996 IDF days. In between streaking through the sky, Golan, married and with an infant child, studied electrical engineering ("because it was the toughest thing to do") as a mature student at the Technion university in Haifa. He gained a BSc degree, finished his air force service and went to work as an electrical engineer – not an exceptional one he says – at Intel. But being the kind of guy who likes challenges, he wanted to go way beyond designing better ways of using amps and volts. "The most fascinating thing in life is people. I wanted to combine the people aspect with technology," he says. Living in America Eager to learn how businesses work and run his own company, Golan decided to study business at the prestigious Kellogg School of Management in Evanston, Illinois. "I really wanted to study business at the best place in the world, and also get to know America," he says. Students on Kelogg's two-year exec MBA course are required to have a full-time job, so he persuaded Intel to move him over to the USA and brought his wife and child with him. Golan is a persuasive guy, always outlining a vision of how great it is going to be and arguing the logical necessity of it all. "Let me tell you why I believe that…" he keeps saying, with an obvious need for you to agree. He sees relationships as a full-time job, and everything is family. Kaminario is his work family, his backers are his funding family, channel partners are a reselling family, and Israel and its citizens are another, huge family. Golan believes people work for, invest in, sell to, buy from and care for people. He wants people to be believe in him and be successful with him, and is good at connecting with others. It's part of his talent, and sometimes almost overwhelming. For him, relationships are not a light matter. Dani gets the call While Golan was studying at Kellogg and working for Intel, he got a call from Moshe Yanai, ex-tank commander in the IDF, Technion electrical engineering graduate, helicopter pilot, EMC engineering wizard, vice president of the Symmetrix group and its product creator at Hopkinton. It was as if a storage deity had called after hearing about Golan from a contact in the IDF. Golan started working at EMC in July 2001*, doing software things; Joe Tucci had become EMC CEO in January 2001, after joining as president and COO in 2000. (Tucci replaced Michael Ruettger, the previous CEO, and then forced Moshe Yanai** out later in 2001, earlier having moved him into an advisory position.) Symmetrix technology had fallen behind the competition (in not using Fibre Channel, for example), and lower-cost CLARiiON (what became VNX) array sales and development hadn't been prioritised. Tucci started cleaning out EMC's stables in response to a severe revenue downturn as customers stopped buying Symmetrix arrays. Revenues slumped from $8.9bn in 2000 to $6.8bn in 2001. Cuts had to be made. About 10,000 staff were laid off out of a total 26,000. The blood-letting started in May, two months before Golan joined, with several layoff rounds in the next few months. Golan was lucky to be taken on when all this was going on. He gained an MBA from Kellogg in 2003 and moved into EMC's NAS IP business, reporting to vice chairman Bill Teuber in 2006 and working on strategy. You don't get to be a CEO without promoting yourself to others, and Dani says: "Joe Tucci noticed me and admitted me to the exec management team when I was a relative kid. He would always ask the opinion of junior people in the room. I told him he should invest in VMware." Performix move Then Golan got an offer to be the COO of Performix, a BI/workforce performance management company. He says he had long and painful discussions with people, including Tucci, before accepting. Performix had been acquired by Israel-based Nice Systems back in 2006, and Golan was involved in the Performix reshaping. This is where he got his operational management experience. A big problem Performix customers had was getting data off storage arrays fast enough. They had IO bottlenecks. Ofir Dubovi was a vice president and COO at Performix, and became the COO for Nice Systems in late 2006. So now we have two of Kaminario's co-founders working for the same business. Where did Moshe Selfin come from? At that time he was an international sales and business development leader at IBM, having joined from being a solutions director at EMC in September 2006. He managed IBM's Israel software-as-a-service (SaaS) programme. Dubovi, Golan and Selfin set up Kaminario together to fix the storage IO bottleneck problem. They based it in Israel in 2008, working out of the bomb shelter located on one floor of the current office building in Yokneam, north of Tel Aviv. Selfin is credited with inventing Kaminario's DRAM-based original K2 array. Dani Golan with his favourite inspirational quote Life is a serious business for Dani, beneath the sense of fun he promotes in Kaminario. He sets himself challenges and surrounds his staff with inspirational quotations and messages. One is Albert Einstein’s “Everything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler.” Kaminario CEO being persuasive Golan likes trying out new dishes in restaurants, learning new skills and mastering problems. He has a knack of focusing intently, as if pushing a lighthouse beam through a microscope – which can be unnerving if you are the item on the specimen slide. Golan treats Kaminario rather like a favourite toy. It’s going to be a truly great company, he is more than willing to explain. However long you give him, he will beam that lighthouse intensity into your brain and have you believing it too. ® * Footnote Doron Kempel, SimpliVity's CEO, headed a media solutions group at EMC from 1998 to September 2001. Kaminario's position as an all-flash array supplier is somewhat similar to SimpliVity's in the HCIA market: both are second to a larger, post-IPO former startup: Pure for Kaminario and Nutanix for SimpliVity. ** Footnote 2 A joke at the time was that EMC stood for “eventually Moshe’s company".

Eyes Above The Waves Robert O'Callahan. Christian. Repatriate Kiwi. Hacker. Monday, 14 November 2016 Handling Hardware Lock Elision In rr Intel's Hardware Lock Elision feature lets you annotate instructions with prefixes to indicate that they perform lock/unlock operations. The CPU then turns those into hardware memory transactions so that the instructions in the locked region are performed speculatively and only committed at the unlock. The difference between HLE and the more capable RTM transactional memory support is that HLE is supposed to be fully transparent. The prefixes are ignored on non-HLE-supporting CPUs so you can just add them to your code and things will hopefully get faster --- no CPUID checks are necessary. Unfortunately, by default, Intel's hardware performance counters count events in aborted transactions, even though they didn't really happen in terms of user-space effects. Thus when rr records a program that uses HLE, our conditional branch counter may report a value higher than the number of conditional branches that "really" executed, and this breaks rr. (FWIW we discovered this problem when Emilio was using rr to debug intermittent failures in Servo using the latest version of the Rust parking_lot crate.) For RTM we have some short-term hacks to disable RTM usage in glibc, and the medium-term solution is to use "CPUID faulting" to trap CPUID and modify the feature bits to pretend RTM is not supported. This approach doesn't work for HLE because there is no need to check CPUID before using it. Fortunately Intel provides an IN_TXCP flag that you can set on a hardware performance counter to indicate that it should not count events in aborted transactions. This is exactly what we need. However, for replay we need to be able to program the PMU to send an interrupt after a certain number of events have occurred, and the Linux kernel prevents us from doing that for IN_TXCP counters. Apparently that's because if you request an interrupt after a small number of events and then execute an HLE transaction that generates more than that number of events, the CPU will detect the overflow, abort the transaction, roll the counter back to its pre-transaction value, then the kernel notices there wasn't really an overflow, restarts the transaction, and you're in an infinite loop. The solution to our dilemma is to use two counters to count conditional branches. One counter is used to generate interrupts, and it is allowed to count events in aborted transactions. Another counter uses IN_TXCP to avoid counting events in aborted transactions, and we use this counter only for measurement, never for generating interrupts. This setup works well. It means that during replay our interrupt might fire early, because the interrupt counter counted events in aborted transactions, but that's OK because we already have a mechanism to carefully step forward to the correct stopping point. There is one more wrinkle. While testing this new approach I noticed that there are some cases where the IN_TXCP counter reports spurious events. This is obviously a nasty little bug in the hardware, or possibly the kernel. On my system you can reproduce it just by running perf stat -e r5101c4 -e r2005101c4 ls --- the second event is just the IN_TXCP version of the first event (retired conditional branches), so should always report counts less than or equal to the first event, but I get results like  Performance counter stats for 'ls':
         1,994,374      r5101c4                                                     
         1,994,382      r2005101c4 I have a much simpler testcase than ls which I'll try to get someone at Intel to look at. For now, we're working around it in rr by using the results of the regular counter when the IN_TXCP counter's value is larger. This should work as long as an IN_TXCP overcount doesn't occur in an execution sequence that also uses HLE, and both of those are hopefully rare.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 13, 2016 at 5:00PM For several years now, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been more actively building processor and platform technologies targeted at the very low-end of the personal computer market. These products are based on the company's low-power Atom architectures, rather than its higher-end Core processor architectures. Intel's Client Computing Group chief, Navin Shenoy, holding a processor. Image source: Intel.  At the company's 2015 investor meeting, now-former Intel personal computer chief Kirk Skaugen told investors that between 2010 and 2015, Intel gained approximately 10 percentage points of personal computer processor market share. A lot of that, the executive indicated, was due to Intel's renewed push in the low-end of the market. Intel now seems to be aiming to release new products for this market on an annual cadence to continue to bring new features and technologies to lower, high-volume personal computer price points. The product line that Intel currently offers for this market is called Apollo Lake. In late 2017, Intel is expected to launch a product for this market called Gemini Lake. Thanks to Michael Larabel with website Phoronix, we now have some preliminary information about Gemini Lake. This looks like an "optimization" of Apollo Lake Gemini Lake is going to be the third low-cost Atom-based personal computer processor family built in Intel's 14-nanometer technology, following Braswell and Apollo Lake. Braswell included a mildly enhanced version of the Silvermont processor core found inside the prior-generation Bay Trail product -- manufactured in a 22-nanometer technology -- along with a larger, more powerful graphics engine. Apollo Lake brought significant improvements to both the graphics processing engine as well as the main processor relative to Braswell. Gemini Lake shares much with the prior-generation Apollo Lake, according to Larabel. The fundamental graphics architecture of Apollo Lake, Larabel says, is the same "gen9lp" technology -- that is, low-power Intel ninth-generation graphics -- used in Apollo Lake. Although the full specifications of the chip haven't been made public, this information probably points to Gemini Lake as an "optimization" of the prior-generation Apollo Lake. What that would mean is that the processor core and graphics architecture will remain largely unchanged, with perhaps some very mild changes elsewhere in the chip. The main performance improvement is likely to come from Intel's using an updated, higher-performance variant of its 14-nanometer technology, known as 14-nanometer+. This should allow Intel to boost the CPU and graphics frequencies without raising power consumption, delivering better performance. 10-nanometer Atom in late 2018? It's likely that Gemini Lake will be the last Atom-based personal-computer processor family built in some derivative of Intel's 14-nanometer manufacturing technology. The next part, according to this code from InstLatx64, is known as Mercury Lake and will probably be manufactured in Intel's 10-nanometer technology. If Intel sticks to an annual product release cadence, then we should expect to see Mercury Lake arrive in the fourth quarter of 2018. Intel will have been in production on 10-nanometer technology for about a year at that point, so one can only hope that the technology will be mature enough, and therefore cost-effective enough, to support high-volume production of a chip design targeted at low-cost personal computers. The key for Intel is to make sure to not let up on improving product features and performance in this segment of the market; if low-cost computers fall significantly short of premium smartphones in these areas, then potential buyers of these computers might simply decide to move even more of their daily computing tasks to those phones. That would hurt demand for personal computers and ultimately hurt Intel. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

By Matthew DeCarlo on Nov 13, 2016, 12:00 PM TechSpot The GTX 1080 Ti may have 10GB of VRAM Nvidia's GTX Titan class GPUs always come with huge price tags and the Pascal GTX Titan X is no different, costing $1200 in the US. GTX Titan series GPUs have never been about value for money, but they have always resulted in lower end GTX variants like the GTX 780Ti or GTX 980Ti that provide gamers with relatively good value for money. Ever since the GTX Titan X launched the big question on consumers lips was "where is the GTX 1080Ti", knowing that a more affordable variant is in the works. Now, a Nvidia GPU that is thought to be the GTX 1080 Ti has been found in an Indian shipping manifest... OC3D Intel may add Wi-Fi, USB 3.1 to next-generation chipsets Motherboard chipsets haven’t really changed much in the last few years. There’s been some support for new storage options and standards, like M.2 for SSDs, some limited support for features like Thunderbolt, and faster memory speeds have trickled out over time. Intel might shake things up a bit for its 300-series chipsets in 2017, if rumors are to be believed, with integrated support for Wi-Fi and USB 3.1. ExtremeTech OAuth 2.0 hack exposes 1 billion mobile apps to account hijacking Third-party applications that allow single sign-on via Facebook and Google and support the OAuth 2.0 protocol, are exposed to account hijacking. Three Chinese University of Hong Kong researchers presented at Black Hat EU last week a paper called "Signing into One Billion Mobile LApp Accounts Effortlessly with OAuth 2.0." The paper describes an attack that takes advantage of poor OAuth 2.0 implementations and puts more than one billion apps in jeopardy. Threatpost Customer sues Charter, Time Warner Cable over "Broadcast TV" fees; doesn’t seek monetary damages Last month, Comcast customers accused the cable company of illegally using its "Broadcast TV" and "Regional Sports" fees to raise customers' bills by as much as $10/month. Now a customer of the recently merged Time Warner Cable and Charter Communications is accusing the providers of breaking the law by using similar fees to hide rate hikes while implying to subscribers that these surcharges are required by the government. Consumerist Warning: 2016 MacBook Pro is not compatible with Linux Problems so far: intremap=nosid is required to even boot with Linux. Otherwise you get a black screen after GRUB. Built in keyboard and mouse not working. Only the power key works to force reboot (non-touchbar). Worst of all, the NVMe SSD has the wrong PCI class ID, so it won't work as a boot drive. /r/Ubuntu NES Classic Edition - Teardown - Unboxing - Repair Video Let the nostalgia begin.

JerryRigEverything Tech support scammers bite Chrome users with forgotten 2014 bug Tech support scammers have started exploiting a two-year-old bug in Google Chrome to trick victims into believing their PC is infected with malware. The bug was discovered in Chrome 35 in July 2014 in the history.pushState() HTML5 function, a way of adding web pages into the session history without actually loading the page in question. Sophos Facebook demonstrates record-breaking data rate using millimeter-wave technology At Facebook’s Connectivity Lab, we are actively working to develop a variety of terrestrial and airborne technologies to help connect the world. One of our goals is to provide connectivity in areas without traditional infrastructure and reliable power sources, so these technologies should be low-cost, energy efficient, and able to support a capacity of tens of gigabits per second over long ranges. Facebook Google Pixel pwned in 60 seconds Power of Community The Google Pixel fell to a team of Chinese hackers alongside Apple Safari and Adobe Flash at the PwnFest hacking competition in Seoul on Friday. Mountain View's latest offering was smashed by white-hat friendlies from Qihoo 360, who used an undisclosed vulnerability to gain remote code execution for $120,000 cash prize. The exploit launched the Google Play store before opening Chrome and displaying a web page reading "Pwned By 360 Alpha Team". The Register Quick, how might the alien spacecraft work? "It's an interesting script," said someone on our PR team. It's pretty common for us to get requests from movie makers about showing our graphics or posters or books in movies. But the request this time was different: could we urgently help make realistic screen displays for a big Hollywood science fiction movie that was just about to start shooting? Backchannel Arduworm: A malware for your Arduino Yun We’ve been waiting for this one. A worm was written for the Internet-connected Arduino Yun that gets in through a memory corruption exploit in the ATmega32u4 that’s used as the serial bridge. The paper (as PDF) is a bit technical, but if you’re interested, it’s a great read. (Edit: The link went dead. Here is our local copy.) Hackaday New record! Robot solves rubik's cube in less than a second Solving a Rubik's Cube is an impressive feat by itself, but now, a robot can do it in record time, cracking the 3D puzzle about 10 times faster than the human who holds the world record. In just over half of a second (0.637 seconds), the Sub1 Reloaded robot made each side of the Rubik's Cube show a single color. This breaks the previous record of 0.887 seconds achieved by an earlier version of the same machine using a different processor. Live Science Apple said to release curved, bezel-free 5-inch and 5.8-inch iPhones next year Apple will release new 5-inch and 5.8-inch iPhones with curved, bezel-free designs next year, according to Barclays Research analysts Blayne Curtis, Christopher Hemmelgarn, Thomas O'Malley, and Jerry Zhang. The analysts, citing sources within Apple's supply chain following a trip to Asia this week, said the borderless design will allow for the new iPhones to be the same overall size as current 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models. MacRumors DIY coprocessors for the Game Boy Color Back in the olden days, when video games still came on cartridges, the engineers and programmers making these carts had a lot of options. One of the most inventive, brilliant, and interesting cartridges to come out of the 90s was Star Fox for the Super Nintendo. Star Fox featured a coprocessor chip, the Super FX, that was effectively a GPU used to draw polygons in the frame buffer. Hackaday Video games are boring Video games are bigger than movies. Everyone's a gamer. I've devoted my life-no exaggeration-to video games for 14 years, working on titles such as Company of Heroes, a few Assassin's Creeds, and Child of Light. But everywhere I go, I meet people who don't like video games. Most of my friends don't like video games. And one of my favourite things when I'm meeting a new person is to watch them squirm, to struggle to relate, after I mention I work in the video game industry. Games Industry Artificial-intelligence system surfs web to improve its performance Of the vast wealth of information unlocked by the Internet, most is plain text. The data necessary to answer myriad questions -- about, say, the correlations between the industrial use of certain chemicals and incidents of disease, or between patterns of news coverage and voter-poll results — may all be online. But extracting it from plain text and organizing it for quantitative analysis may be prohibitively time consuming. MIT LipNet: How easy do you think lipreading is? Lipreading is the task of decoding text from the movement of a speaker's mouth. Traditional approaches separated the problem into two stages: designing or learning visual features, and prediction. More recent deep lipreading approaches are end-to-end trainable (Wand et al., 2016; Chung & Zisserman, 2016a). All existing works, however, perform only word classification, not sentence-level sequence prediction. Yannis Assael Reasons not to use Uber We should not accept the promotional term "sharing economy" for companies like Uber. That is spin. A more accurate term is "piecework subcontractor economy". Because I reject technology that mistreats me, I will never order or pay for an Uber car. I hope there will always be taxis I can use. But what about you?

The Santa Clara chip maker is readying several unlocked processors based on Kaby Lake, and the overclockable parts aren't just limited to the high end SKUs, either—budget buyers are welcome to come along for the ride, too. We've already seen leaks of unlocked Core i7 and Core i5 processors wading in Kaby Lake. However, the latest leak suggests that Intel will target cost conscious system builders with at least one unlocked Core i3 series processor, that being the Core i3-7350K. A leaked price list shows the retail box version going for $177. If that stands, street pricing could end up being anywhere from $150 to $180, depending on sale pricing and promotions. The Core i3-7350K will be a dual-core processor with Hyper Threading support. It will run fast out of the gate with a base clockspeed of 4GHz and a boost frequency of 4.2GHz, so it will be interesting to see how much overclocking headroom actually exists. We have to imagine there will be at least a few hundred MHz attainable on air cooling, especially if ends up with a TDP rating of 61W as expected. It also has 4MB of L3 cache. Kaby Lake is Intel's 7th generation Core processor architecture. It's built on a 14nm FinFET manufacturing process and is the first architecture to disrupt Intel's traditional tick-tock release cadence. The reason for its release is because getting down to 10nm has proven a bit more difficult than Intel expected, prompting the company to delay Cannonlake until late next year. Kaby Lake fills the gap as a second consecutive tock following Skylake. Having a second consecutive tock isn't all that exciting to enthusiasts, hence a possible reason why Intel is going after the overclocking crowd. The Core i3-7350K is a sub-$200 part that could open up overclocking to a wider audience because of its price and default clockspeeds.

Login Search Tech Stock Roundup: AAPL Upgrade, GOOGL-EU, BABA Singles Day November 14, 2016, 03:04:00 PM EDT By Sejuti Banerjea, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo The election was the biggest event last week, easily blotting out everything else, especially because of the surprise President-elect. But that didn't stop a hot Apple AAPL rumor from KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo; or Alphabet's GOOGL defense of its Android ecosystem; or the gangbuster Singles Day numbers from Alibaba BABA . So read on… Apple May Not Upgrade iPhone SE KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo is famous for breaking Apple product-related news. This time, he's saying that the company may not refresh the budget iPhone "SE" line next year. The rationale is purportedly to boost demand for the more expensive and higher-margin iPhone 7, while also pressuring SE component makers to reduce prices. This pressure may increase because Apple is now selling refurbished, certified iPhones from its online store. The iPhone SE is a very competitive and lighter phone, especially if you can make do with a smaller screen and 64GB storage, don't mind a somewhat weaker front camera and more limited water resistance, and also really want the headphone jack. The analyst feels that not refreshing the SE, weaker China demand and lower 4.7-inch volumes will impact iPhone sales next year. He forecasts an iPhone shipment volume decline to between 35 and 40 million (40.4 million units were shipped in 2Q16). He also has reservations about component price declines. Google Defends Android Google has its rival Yandex to thank for this one, as the leading Russian search engine's (until it was displaced by Google) complaint to the Competition Commission precipitated proceedings. In 2013, Google rivals Microsoft MSFT , Nokia and Oracle ORCL had gone to the EU through an umbrella organization called Fairsearch. But it was hard to pin Google guilty, leading to the case dragging on. But when in Russia, Google required phone makers to pre-install Google search (just as everywhere else) instead of Yandex, the company went to court. In this case, the EU is investigating 3 angles as Techcrunch pointed out so well- that Google is allegedly "requiring and incentivizing" smartphone and tablet manufacturers to exclusively install its own services, and in particular its search engine that it is allegedly bundling certain Google products with other apps & services whether Google is hindering the ability of smartphone and tablet makers to use and develop other OS versions of Android (aka Android forks) If found guilty, Google will have to pay up to 10% of revenue, or around $7.4 billion. The crux of Google's response of more than 100 pages is that Google's practices are with a view to prevent fragmentation of the platform without which Android would be weakened and competition would in fact be impaired. It says that the Commission's decision to omit Apple as a competitor appears arbitrary and partisan. It makes no sense because the Commission's own survey revealed that 89% of respondents consider Apple and Android as competing platforms . Besides, it allows the Commission to conveniently ignore the fact that 39 out of 39 pre-installed apps on iPhone 7 are from Apple, and 39 out of 47 pre-installed apps on the Microsoft Lumia 550 are from Microsoft. Android has allowed phone makers to bring cheaper phones to the market and has helped millions of app developers. A weak platform would be bad for everyone. In the words of Kent Walker Google's general counsel, "The response we filed today shows how the Android ecosystem carefully balances the interests of users, developers, hardware makers, and mobile network operators. Android hasn't hurt competition, it's expanded it." Alibaba Singles Day Alibaba had a record Singles Day with sales of $17.79 billion, up from the record $14.3 billion last year and short of the $20 billion analysts were projecting. But these sales are nothing to scoff at: 2015 sales in the U.S. on Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined and from all stores (both online and offline) totaled $19.4 billion. This year, Singles Day moved across the border, with the top markets for Chinese goods being Russia, Spain, Israel, Ukraine and France. Top markets selling to the Chinese were Japan, U.S., South Korea, Australia and Germany. The most popular brands were Apple, Nike, New Balance, Siemens, Philips and Adidas. Around 37% of shoppers bought from international stores with virtual reality creating new experiences like Chinese customers browsing the isles of Macy's store in New York without ever leaving their seats. But clouds are looming for Alibaba with the election of Donald Trump. The company's business hinges on China-U.S. relations, so it will be negatively hit by Trump's decision to charge a heavy tax on Chinese goods. If the Chinese government reacts with similar duty on U.S. goods, Alibaba will be affected very badly. The other concern is with respect to its accounting practices, particularly with respect to its Singles Day sales, for which the company is being investigated both in the U.S. and in China.

Adam Mosseri, VP of product management at Facebook says, "In Newsfeed we use various signals based on community feedback to determine which posts are likely to contain inaccurate information, and reduce their distribution. In Trending we look at a variety of signals to help make sure the topics being shown are reflective of real-world events, and take additional steps to prevent false or misleading content from appearing. Despite these efforts we understand there's so much more we need to do, and that is why it's important that we keep improving our ability to detect misinformation." The company earlier formed an alliance with various media houses for similar reasons although the possibility of potential business partners colluding to suppress or misinform the public for vested interests is a bit unsettling. Singapore Civil Service Chooses Facebook Workplace : Singapore's civil service is adopting the Facebook Workplace platform for its pool of 143K (and growing) public servants by March 2017. The platform is inexpensive at just a dollar per user per month for groups larger than 10K people, so it's a good deal for Facebook as well. In fact, this is the first deal of its kind for Facebook and underscores the platform's popularity in Asia. Legal/Regulatory Irish Finance Minister Will Go to Bat for Apple : The EU Competition Commission has determined that Apple owes taxes to the tune of $14.5 billion for illegally transferring profits generated in Ireland to a titular head office in a tax free zone. Irish Finance Minister Noonan says that the Commission is acting out of its jurisdiction because tax is a matter decided by individual countries and the competition angle is just a back door to meddle in the member nation's internal affairs. The tax breaks enjoyed by Apple are part of state aid that some European countries resort to with the objective of attracting investment in the region. Apple has around 6K employees in Ireland. In September, the cabinet approved Ireland's joining Apple in appealing the EU's demand, and Noonan submitted his appeal last week. LinkedIn Banned in Russia : The professional network faces a ban in Russia because of a law passed in 2014, requiring websites storing personal data of Russians to store it in servers within the country, says Russia's Roskomnadzor communications watchdog. LinkedIn reportedly has 6 million users in the country, so it could be a near-term blow. However, the problem may not be long-lived given its pending acquisition by Microsoft. Amazon Refunds for In-App Purchases : A federal judge has ruled that Amazon AMZN must take the responsibility of informing and then refunding parents, when their kids run up bills related to unauthorized in-app purchases. While judge Coughenour agreed with Amazon that the $26.5 million decided by the FTC was too high, he ruled out lump sum payments and gift cards for the amount as Amazon would collect profit on goods sold through gift cards. In similar dealings, Apple and Google coughed up around $32.5 million and $19 million, respectively. Unauthorized purchasing has been curtailed however, with the help of improved controls since then. New Technology/Products Pre-Owned iPhones Now on Sale : Last September, when Apple introduced the concept of iPhone annual upgrades and AppleCare+ for $32 a month, I had speculated that they wanted to build inventory of phones on which manufacturing cost was already recovered to target emerging markets like India. But competitors protested this in India, so Apple needed a Plan B (which may have also been in the works actually). With the anniversary up, Apple would be receiving these phones about now. So it is selling these refurbished (new battery and outer shell) phones after testing and certifying them at a 15% discount through the app store and making a huge profit. Apple is reportedly selling eight versions, all with a one-year warranty. The decision is also of great strategic importance as it could prevent users from moving away to cheaper phones from competitors. It's also a way for Apple to further expand its user base, enabling it to sell more services. The current rates are $399 for the 4GB model, which sells for $499 at full retail and $499 for the 8GB model, which sells for $599. Facebook App for Emerging Markets : Facebook is determined to eat Snapchat's lunch and the leading social network is doing about all it can to replicate Snapchat-like features such as Instagram stories, "secret" (erased after some time) conversations and more. Now it's launched Flash, a Snapchat-like platform targeted at emerging markets like Brazil, Indonesia and India where the Facebook brand name is very well recognized. This may cap Snapchat's progress in emerging markets while strengthening Facebook versus this picture-sharing networking platform. Intel's New Chip Tech : Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland has called out Intel's high-speed, in-package optical interconnect silicon photonics technology as a product with the capacity to "revolutionize the semiconductor industry". As the analyst says, it will definitely mitigate the effects of a slowing Moore's law by reducing the interconnect time between Intel's Xeon Server CPUs and Altera's FPGAs, i.e. until Intel integrates the technology into a single piece. The analyst also said that Intel has "proof of concept" chips and is looking to improve current low production yields. This could lead to a commercial product just three to five years down the line. Rolland estimates that data transfer rates may start at 50 to 100 gigabits per second with the new chips, but could increase to a half terabit or 2 terabits by early next decade, he said. Google, Apple App Store Updates : Both Google and Apple have huge app marketplaces, which might make it difficult for developers to reach buyers. The two companies are therefore always looking for ways to help developers get their apps seen. Google had many encouraging announcements such as a) allowing developers to offer limited-time discounted subscription pricing for their apps b) a promise to expand the Google Play Store to wearables, VR headsets, and Chromebook laptops for easier distribution from a single marketplace and c) a decision to employ machine-learning algorithms more heavily to provide app recommendations for Google Play users. Apple, which earlier this year promised developers a bigger revenue share and more reviews for new apps, announced that they can now create early-access promotional codes for new apps that can be offered to journalists and reviewers. These should help them generate more publicity for their new apps and in-app purchases. Some Numbers Google Home vs. Amazon Echo : IHS Markit says that Google Home will solidly beat Amazon Echo by 2020, shipping 5.4 million units that year, while Amazon will be stuck at 2.4 million units. Amazon does have a first mover advantage right now, but it will evaporate over the years as Google uses its treasure trove of data to more fruitfully apply artificial intelligence according to the research firm. Apple is also expected to join the fray with a device based on Siri. The Google device is fifty bucks cheaper at $129, but lacks Amazon's skills (app ecosystem). This should be a very short-term hurdle as Google has the wherewithal to more than catch up here. NVIDIA Results : NVIDIA reported solid results this past quarter with its adjusted EPS of 83 cents far outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents on the back of solid revenues that also beat our expectations by a wide margin.

By the time the closing bell rang, the S&P 500 was at 2,164.20, down a mere quarter of a point from Friday’s last trade. It could have been worse, though, and for owners of Puma Biotechnology Inc (NYSE:PBYI), Dynavax Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:DVAX) and Petroleo Brasileiro SA Petrobras (ADR) (NYSE:PBR), it was worse. These three names ended the session deep in the red, although for understandable reasons. Petroleo Brasileiro SA Petrobras (ADR) (PBR) Take your pick of reasons Brazilian oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA Petrobras — you know it better as just Petrobras — sold off in a big way today. There was more than one. The biggest unspoken reason PBR ended the day down 1.6% today was another meteoric rise of the U.S. dollar. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced another 0.95% (a huge move for currency) on Monday in step with another surge in U.S. interest rates. In that crude oil prices are priced in U.S. dollars, even for foreign oil companies, a rising dollar works against oil company profitability. 7 CEOs That Are Heading to the Chopping Block by 2018 Fanning the bearish flames that burned PBR on Monday was a lackluster third-quarter earnings report. Although that bad news came out before Friday’s open and took a toll then, the bears weren’t done yet. The oil giant booked a $5.05 billion loss. Much of that was a one-time loss, but not enough of it was to let PBR remain unscathed on Monday. Dynavax Technologies Corporation (DVAX) If you thought the 1.6% hit PBR took on Monday was rough, that’s nothing to the sucker-punch that shareholders of Dynavax Technologies suffered today. DVAX plunged 65% after the Food and Drug Administration rejected its ballyhooed hepatitis B vaccine Heplisav-B. Dynavax Technologies still feel Heplisav-B has a future. CEO Eddie Gray commented: “The CRL is consistent with our opinion that Heplisav-B is approvable and we are seeking to meet with the FDA as soon as possible. However, the time and resources that will be required to gain approval leads us to consider that we may not be able to advance this program on our own and we are moving swiftly to identify a potential pharmaceutical or financial partner.” The market, however, clearly isn’t as optimistic, sending DVAX shares to its lowest levels since 2008. Puma Biotechnology Inc (PBYI) Last but not least, DVAX wasn’t the only biopharma name to be up-ended by bad news regarding one of its drugs on Friday. Puma Biotechnology was also whacked in response to reports that its breast cancer drug neratinib. Like Heplisav-B, neratinib is not yet on the market. It’s currently being reviewed by the FDA. Although there has been no word yet from the FDA, Puma in the meantime disclosed that it will need to add a second anti-diarrhea agent to the therapy. That addition may well make it even more difficult to approve the drug. The 20.4% tumble PBYI took today, however, may have more to do with the fact that some attorneys are already planning class-action lawsuits, which will claim the company failed to adequately disclose all the potential risks to neratinib’s approval.

Back in 1993, Intel’s new Pentium chip turned out to not be very good at math, fouling up certain division problems past the eighth decimal point. NASA lost an incredibly expensive probe back in 1998 because someone forgot to convert pound-seconds into newton-seconds, causing the $125 million space vehicle to crash into Mars’ atmosphere too fast. Then Apple had a little SNAFU of its own back in 2012, when its Maps app led us down nonexistent roads or insisted we drive off nonexistent bridges. Last month there was an even more epic failure, which wasn’t any one company’s fault so much as an across-the-board lack of foresight. On October 21st, New Hampshire-based Dyn came under a massive distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attack, taking down a host of sites like Netflix, Twitter and the New York Times. Unless you’re an IT professional there’s no need to worry if you’ve never heard of Dyn, but it provides domain registration services and basically acts as the internet’s phone book. When you type in a web address, your browser basically checks it against Dyn’s directory to make sure it’s going to the right place. While Dyn is generally pretty fast – there’s a barely perceptible moment between hitting enter on that web address and the site popping up – on that day thousands, and maybe even millions (there’s no real way of knowing) of address checks starting coming in every second. The sources of those requests were pretty familiar; your printer, your security camera, baby monitors; pretty much anything that was “connected” could have been complicit in the attack. You can thank the Internet of Things (IoT) for that. IoT-enabled devices make our lives much easier in a lot of ways, allowing us to keep track of what’s going on at home when we’re away or control our environments to just to name a couple. Because the benefit of a connected device has to be weighed against factors like size, ease of use and power consumption, security can be lacking and, if it is there, either rudimentary or impossible to use. This particular attack appears to have been accomplished using a bit of malware called Mirai. Mirai basically scans the internet for connected devices that use 62 common default username and password combinations and, when it finds them, takes them over. That creates a “botnet” of compromised devices, which then bend to the hackers will. There’s understandably a push to improve the security of IoT devices but, again, there’s a fine line to walk. For security to improve, the technology itself really needs to improve. While you could say it’s too little, too late – with billions of devices already connected and more being added every day – I’m not sure that’s something to quibble about. Anything is better than nothing. Of course where there’s a problem, especially in technology, you can be pretty certain there is someone looking for a solution. I started looking for companies that are working on IoT security and, while I didn’t come up with any “pure plays” that are publicly traded, I came across about a dozen startups. For instance there’s SecureRF in Connecticut, that is developing a cryptographic technology to protect devices that communicate by radio frequency. Or Rubicon in San Francisco which is working on two-way authentication between IoT devices and the cloud. Then there’s Boston-based PWNIE Express which aims to protect pretty much everything IoT. None of them are quite ready for the Big Board yet, but even before the October attack they had collectively attracted tens of millions of dollars in venture capital funding. Now that the vulnerability has been clearly demonstrated, I definitely expect the pace of investment to pick up and, eventually, those VCs are going to want to cash in. Needless to say, I’m going to be watching for IoT security IPOs and I don’t think it’s going to be a very long wait.

Microsoft's Hybrid Device Likely To Outshine The iPad Pro 2 (Photo : Andrew Burton/Getty Images) If recently surfaced reports are anything to go by, Microsoft Surface Pro 5 release date is just around the corner. Advertisement Despite lack of an official announcement, there have been plenty of hearsays indicating that the highly anticipated gadget will hit the stores in 2017. With Black Friday approaching, bevies of deals are now being offered for quite a few devices. Meanwhile, more and more reports have advised consumers to ignore the deals for Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 citing the imminent launch of its successor, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5. Multiple reports suggest that the Redmond based tech firm is gearing up to launch a hybrid device geared with Intel's much awaited Kaby Lake processors. In fact, Microsoft Surface Pro 5 release date was reportedly pushed back from late 2016 to early 2017 in order to coincide with the launch of Intel's latest processor. If this comes to fruition and the Surface Pro 5 comes equipped with the latest Kaby Lake chips, this will propel the gadget far beyond than rest of its competitors, especially the Apple iPad Pro 2, which rumors claim is likely to arrive early 2017 as well. Besides, the Windows 10 Redstone 2 operating system is also slated to arrive in early 2017. Under the hood, the Surface Pro 5 is rumored to come with 16GB of RAM, coupled with Intel's Kaby Lake processor. The device is likely to boast the Nvidia Pascal GPU card as well, and pack a robust battery equipped with USB-C support, according to iDigitalTimes. In terms of storage capacity, the Surface Pro 5 will boast a mammoth 1TB of storage. If these speculations proved to be true, the device will outshine Apple's 12.9-inch iPad Pro that currently tops at a considerable 256GB of storage and 4GB of RAM, according to Inquisitr. Advertisement It's worth noting that there is possibility that the iPad Pro 2 would continue running on iOS, which is a mobile operating system. This could be one of the biggest drawbacks of the device and is likely to give the Pro 5 an upper hand as compared to its competitor. © 2016 Auto World News, All rights reserved.

Perhaps more interestingly, the switch to AMD provides expanded external display support that desktop users have patiently waited for. As Andrew Cunningham at Ars Technica explains, AMD's Polaris-based Radeon Pro 450, Radeon Pro 455, and built-to-order Radeon Pro 460 GPUs in the new 15-inch MacBook Pro support up to six displays, whereas Intel's integrated GPUs affixed to the logic board can drive a total of three displays. The expanded support enables the new MacBook Pro to drive two of Apple and LG's new UltraFine 5K displays at 60Hz simultaneously. Intel's GPUs can't because, due to bandwidth limitations of the DisplayPort 1.2 spec, the two 5K displays technically function as four displays. This method is known as Multi-Stream Transport (MST). When you hook one of LG's 5K monitors to one of the new MacBook Pros, what you're actually seeing on the screen is two pictures stitched together to make a single seamless image. This is because the version of the DisplayPort spec supported by Intel's GPUs and almost all monitors these days—version 1.2—doesn't have enough bandwidth to drive a 5K display at 60Hz all by itself. […] Apple is actually pushing two DisplayPort 1.2 streams to the monitor over the single Thunderbolt 3 cable. There’s nothing wrong with this method, except that it cuts down on the number of external displays your computer can support. Intel’s integrated GPUs can drive a total of three displays, but you use up two of those three streams to drive one 5K monitor and one of them to drive the laptop’s internal display. AMD’s GPUs support up to six displays, so you can use two of those connections for one 5K monitor, two of them for the other 5K monitor, one for the laptop’s internal display, and still have one left over for yet another monitor if you really wanted to use one.Apple could have used Nvidia's faster Pascal-based GPUs, which support DisplayPort 1.3, but Thunderbolt 3 and most monitors do not support the higher-bandwidth spec yet. In the meantime, Nvidia's GPUs can only drive up to three displays beyond the main MacBook Pro screen — not enough for dual 5K displays over MST. Apple will have more flexibility again when DisplayPort 1.3 becomes more common. Those future laptops will be able to drive two 5K screens plus a laptop’s internal screen using just three DisplayPort streams instead of five. For now, though, if pushing two high-end 5K screens at once was a design goal for Apple, AMD was the only way to go.In terms of performance improvements, Cunningham benchmarked the mid-range 2.7GHz 15-inch MacBook Pro with the Radeon Pro 455 graphics chip to determine just how much faster the notebook truly is compared to the 2016 12-inch MacBook and older MacBook Pros released over the past few years. He found the Radeon Pro 455 to be a "significant boost" over the built-to-order dedicated GPUs available in the 2012-2015 MacBook Pro models, namely the Nvidia GeForce GTX 650M, Nvidia GeForce GTX 750M, and AMD Radeon R9 M370X respectively, but said the new MacBook Pro remains unsuitable for high-end gaming and VR. Is it disappointing that Apple didn’t decide to push the envelope a little more? Sure. Is it too bad that performance and power efficiency were apparently sacrificed in the name of external display support? Yes. Are these midrange GPUs in any way inconsistent with any MacBook Pro released in the last decade? No.Apple officially says the 15-inch MacBook Pro offers up to 130% faster graphics performance, and up to 2.5x more computing power per watt, compared to the previous-generation 15-inch MacBook Pro, but those stats are based on the built-to-order Radeon Pro 460 chip that costs between $100 and $200 extra.

[doublepost=1479149816][/doublepost] How is that perspective? It's a desktop GPU. Unless you're talking about the 1080M, in which case you're looking at a laptop that's only portable on wheels. And just for perspective, the 2012 Cray Titan outFLOPs a dual Xeon workstation. there is no 1080m all current gen laptop have desktop gpu in them. since the 16nm gpu is efficient enough to be not cut back like all the previous gen. so hes not wrong when he say to put in perspective. Rating: 18 Votes avanpelt 2 days ago at 10:39 am Ok, so we'll add this "pro" to the list of cons. Rating: 18 Votes keysofanxiety 2 days ago at 11:11 am Sorry, I didn't realize that for you a 17" 0.88" thick 4k computer weighing 7.8 pounds was only portable on wheels for you. I thought it was a pretty light and sleek machine for a 17" when I saw it. http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-systems/razer-blade-pro Yeah, that already weighs more than the 2011 17" MBP (6.6 pounds). Let alone thinness and battery life. Great argument. Let me be blunt, since a lot of people really don't understand this: historically, Apple portables have prioritised thinness, battery life, design, performance, and specs. In that order. Nothing is new. Nothing has changed. What you have quoted is the complete antithesis of what an Apple portable is. Windows laptops have always had better specs. Better CPUs, better GPUs, more RAM, bigger screens — this isn't anything new. For what the new rMBP is, which is the best spec/weight/thinness compromise, it again is unmatched in the industry. Part of the trouble with the naysayers is that they completely ignore history. It doesn't much help them if they want to sound like they know what they're talking about. Rating: 15 Votes pgiguere1 2 days ago at 10:41 am Crazy how the Radeon Pro 455 is barely faster than the Iris integrated graphics. Wouldn't Iris Pro graphics be just as fast, if not faster than a Radeon Pro 450 then? Makes me wonder why they'd waste money/battery life on discrete graphics if they don't really provide anything on the base model. Rating: 13 Votes keysofanxiety 2 days ago at 10:55 am Just for a little perspective, the GTX 1080 does T-Rex at 1190fps (windows and DirectX). How is that perspective? It's a desktop GPU.

Rating: 12 Votes theitsage 1 day ago at 01:17 pm "Up to 2.5x more computing power per watt" is the carefully chosen marketing bs to disguise the overall GPU performance was not a significant improvement.

The U.S. and China increased the number of supercomputers in the list and are now neck and neck with each having 171 systems, according to the 48th edition of the rankings, released Monday. China had 167 systems to 165 from the U.S. in June's edition of the biannual listing. Germany trailed with 32 systems in the current list, followed by Japan with 27, France at  20, and the U.K. with 17. This is a sea change from a year ago when the U.S. clearly led the pack with 200 supercomputers, followed by China with 108, Japan at 37, Germany with 33, and both France and the UK having 18 of these big systems. The supercomputers are also growing more powerful. The total sustained computing capacity of all the 500 computers on the list is now 672 petaflops, a 60 percent increase from a year ago. One petaflop is one thousand trillion floating-point operations per second. The U.S. leads in aggregate performance, calculated using the Linpack benchmark, but only marginally at 33.9 percent of the total, with China right behind at 33.3 percent. TaihuLight, capable of 93 petaflops on the Linpack benchmark, had particularly drawn attention because it was built entirely around processors that were designed and made in China.  In June it unseated the top-ranking Tianhe-2 supercomputer, another Chinese computer that had a score of 33.9 petaflops and had led the list of supercomputers for about three years. Installed at the National Supercomputing Center in Wuxi, TaihuLight used 40,960 SW26010 processors each with 260 cores, unlike the Tianhe-2 which uses 260,000 Intel Xeon E5-2692v2 12-core processors. The move was seen as a bid by the country to reduce its dependence on foreign processor technology in critical areas after the U.S. banned the supply of Intel Xeon chips to four Chinese supercomputing research centers. Intel continues to be the major chip supplier for supercomputers with its chips in 462 of the top 500 systems. The share of rival AMD is falling, with its chips figuring in just 7 systems on the current list, down from 13 systems six months earlier. IBM's Power processors have been designed into 22 systems. Hewlett Packard Enterprise, following its acquisition of SGI, now has 140 systems on the list, followed by Lenovo with 92 systems. Cray had 56 systems but leads all vendors in the aggregate performance of its supercomputers. The top 10 list has seen two new entrants, both built around Intel’s Xeon Phi 7250, a 68-core processor codenamed Knights Landing, that delivers 3 peak teraflops of performance. The Cori supercomputer, a Cray XC40 installed at Berkeley Lab’s National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, bagged the number 5 slot with a Linpack rating of 14 petaflops. Following it at number 6 is the new Oakforest-PACS supercomputer, a Fujitsu Primergy CX1640 M1 cluster, in operation at Japan’s Joint Center for Advanced High Performance Computing, which recorded a Linpack score of 13.6 petaflops.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Cooler Master's MasterLiquid Maker 92 CPU cooler reviewed Liquid cooling in a tower-cooler footprint by Jeff Kampman  6:48 PM on November 10, 2016 For builders looking to cool a hot-clocked CPU like Intel's Core i7-6700K, tower-style coolers and closed-loop liquid coolers come with tradeoffs. Go with the tower-style air cooler, and you might need a 170-mm tall monster with multiple 140-mm fans to keep your system cool and quiet. Choose a liquid cooler, and you have to find a place for a huge radiator stack to exhaust its waste heat or hope that your case's airflow is otherwise good enough to move that hot air out. Liquid coolers often leave CPU voltage-regulation circuitry at the mercy of fans around the CPU socket, too, and their pump noise can be an annoyance to those with sensitive ears. Those tradeoffs are hard enough to make in a roomy ATX mid-tower, but builders of high-end systems in compact microATX or Mini-ITX cases might have an especially hard time finding a powerful enough cooler to make their dreams a reality. Often, it's not even possible to fit a big enough air cooler for high-performance builds inside cases like the Corsair Carbide Series Air 240 or the Graphite Series 380T—it's liquid or nothing. Cooler Master is trying to help those small-form-factor builders out by bringing the best of air and liquid coolers together in one heatsink: the MasterLiquid Maker 92. The concept behind this $100 cooler is so unusual that it doesn't really have its own category yet, so let me explain. The Maker 92 sandwiches a self-contained pump and radiator between a pair of push-pull 95-mm fans. That cooling stack rests atop a bracket that allows the sandwich to rest in a vertical position, like a tower cooler, or in a horizontal one, like a blow-down air cooler. Where the base and heatpipes of a traditional tower-style cooler might go, Cooler Master snaked a pair of coolant hoses down to a low-profile water block with a hefty copper cold plate. This entire self-contained apparatus sits right on top of the CPU socket, just like a tower-style cooler would. It's compact, as well. In its horizontal position, the Maker 92 is just 4.7" (118.8 mm) tall, and its relatively compact footprint shouldn't cause clearance issues with tall memory heatsinks or motherboards with a PCIe x16 slot close to the CPU socket. Flip the cooling stack upright, and the Maker 92 measures in at 6.6" tall (167.5 mm), about the same as the iconic Hyper 212 Evo or the MasterAir Pro 4 we just reviewed. Cooler Master's unique design requires some tradeoffs of its own. The MasterAir Maker 92 only works with Intel LGA 115x and LGA 2011 sockets—builders with AMD CPUs are left entirely out in the cold. On the off chance you still own an Intel LGA 775 or LGA 1366 motherboard, you also won't find mounting hardware in the Maker 92's box. If you've been building from our recent System Guides, those constraints shouldn't be cause for concern, but they do mean the Maker 92's appeal may not be as wide as it could have been. Builders likely won't be able to swap out the Maker 92's fans, either—their unique 95-mm dimensions aside, these fans are designed specifically to let the Maker 92 do its swivelly thing. If I had to pick a pair of fans to be stuck with, however, the Maker 92's could share far worse lineage than Cooler Master's own Silencio 120 FPs. These fans use five broadly-swept blades in a design that's optimized for static pressure—important for moving air through densely-packed radiator fins. The MasterLiquid Maker 92 draws power from a combination SATA-and-PWM cable that can be gently split in two for more routing freedom. That's handy, since most builders probably won't want to route a dedicated chain of SATA power connectors into the main chambers of their cases just to power the Maker 92. One interesting thing about the Maker 92 is that its fans can shut off entirely when the CPU underneath is at idle. By default, the internal circuitry of the Maker 92 cuts off the fans when the PWM duty cycle from the motherboard falls below 50%. That means the only sound from the cooler at idle will be its pump—a potentially appealing characteristic in noise-sensitive environments. Folks who would prefer airflow at idle will need to set the PWM duty cycle on their CPU fan headers to a level above 50%.

Ross Posted 1 Apr 2008 | 19:04 GMT Advertisement   Image: Intel; Charts: Michael Vella Not so long ago, competitive sorts would boast of the cycle rate of their PC’s central processing unit. But now it seems the only people who talk it up are the overclockers—hobbyists who push their CPUs beyond their specified limits. There are two reasons: CPU clock rates peaked a few years ago [see graph, top], and they aren't a very useful key to chip performance anyway. The clock keeps a processor's parts working in unison, like rowers on a galley ship. Other things being equal, the more ticks you have per second, the more work will get done. So why not push the clock faster? Because it's no longer worth the cost in terms of power consumed and heat dissipated. Intel calls the speed/power ­tradeoff a ”fundamental theorem of multicore processors”—and that's the reason it makes sense to use two or more processing areas, or cores, on a single chip. Intel reports that ­underclocking a single core by 20 percent saves half the power while sacrificing just 13 percent of the ­performance. That means that if you divide the work between two cores running at an 80 percent clock rate, you get 73 percent better performance for the same power. And the heat is dissipated at two points rather than one. So even though the cutting-edge logic chip gulps ever more power [see graph, center], it isn't about to melt its way through the floor. That bodes well for Moore's Law, which predicts that about every two years, ­manufacturers will double the number of ­transistors they cram onto a given bit of silicon. The fundamental theorem says that we'll still be able to make full use of those transistors for a good long time. If once the whole choir of transistors had to sing to the beat of a single metronome, now it can split up into sections—and harmonize. Count Paces? Or Measure The Distance Traveled? The rising power consumption of CPUs [graph, center] made it less attractive to focus on cycles per second, so clock rates stalled [graph, top]. A better gauge of performance, the number of instructions performed per second [graph, bottom], continued to rise without ­betraying any hint of the stall. That's because work once done in a single ­processor is now divided among several processing cores—four of them in the case of Intel's Quad-Core chip [below].

Comments CIO | Nov 14, 2016 8:07 AM PT Like this article? thumbsup +1 thumbsdown RELATED TOPICS MacBooks MacOS Hardware Laptops Comments Apple has finally announced the much-awaited upgrades to its Pro line of MacBooks. As expected, Apple made some unorthodox decisions and they are getting beaten up for it. I use a mix of technologies. I have a MacBook, Chromebook, Google Pixel C, Windows 10 PC and I primarily use openSUSE on my main desktop. As a result, I consider myself well educated on the advantages and disadvantages of each platform, without any bias. Although my 2013 MacBook with 8GB of RAM is in great shape and is my go-to device when I am not on my desktop, I am looking at upgrading it to the new MacBook. Should I? In this post I am addressing some of the unfair criticism of the new MacBook Pro and also talking about the facts that make them great devices. First things first: Hardware specs The new MacBooks are running on Intel’s 6th generation Sky Lake processors and not the newly released Kaby Lake. Does that matter? It would have been better if Apple used the latest chips, but for a MacBook user Kaby Lake doesn’t really make a big difference. Both processors are 14nm and are literally identical. The only slight difference you may notice is in the battery life if you watch 4K video. Period. Don’t forget, MacBooks have a long shelf life (Apple claims four years, but they go beyond four years depending on your usecase). Since Intel is moving away from tick-tock model they will probably be releasing a new processor every year. No matter which processor Apple pack into their MacBooks, it’s going to be old by the following year. So don’t keep falling for the newer hardware madness telling you that you should always have the latest and greatest hardware. Is 16GB RAM enough? The short answer is yes. I have the 2013 MacBook Pro that came with 8GB of RAM. Initially I fretted  whether this device is future proof or not. We are approaching 2017 and I am heavily using Adobe Premier, Photoshop, Lightroom and 3d modeling software, and MacBook is serving me very well. In fact it outperformed a high end 2016 laptop with 16GB of RAM. Yes, it would be great to have a 32GB model, but I won’t go over 16GB of RAM for an ultrabook. Why? Because RAM is not a magic potion, you need an equally powerful processor to process the data. USB Type C Thank you Apple for removing all legacy USB ports from the device. USB has been nothing more than a mess. There are at least 7 legacy USB ports. I have to carry around at least 5 types of USB cables  to be able to connect to my devices. My Western Digital external hard drive uses USB B, whereas Nikon d750 uses UC-E17 USB Cable, headphone charger uses Micro USB and Xoom Dictaphone Mini USB, plus USB Type C for my Nexus phone. Yes. That’s legacy USB mess. And don’t forget all those HDMI cables. Please kill the legacy USB!. Get rid of all that mess and everyone, please move to USB Type C. One type to rule them all: from audio video output to charging to data transfers.Needless to say, I am very happy there are no legacy USB ports in MacBooks. Initially I will have to carry 2 adapters, but as soon as the rest of the world moves to USB Type C the better. I am already carrying 5 different cables to survive the legacy USB world. Lack of SD card reader The new MacBooks don’t have a SD card reader. How many people actually use the SD Card reader? The only use case that I can think of is photographers who may prefer SD Card. But it’s not a deal breaker for a professional photographer. Have you seen the bag of a photographer? All you will see is cables, connectors, filters, lenses, SD Cards…one more USB Type C SD Card reader is not going to break their back and chances are they already own one. Missing Magsafe Come on folks. MacBooks are the only devices that offered Magsafe. Do you have MagSafe in your Dell, HP, Lenovo, ASUS laptops? Are you tripping and falling all the time? What do you do with your iPad, iPhone, Android phones? Yes, MagSafe was a good approach but that’s not the end of the world and I am much happier to use the same USB Type C port for charging than MagSafe. Touch bar is a gimmick Finally someone is doing something for those useless function keys. If you are a Chromebook user, you already know how ‘valuable’ those are. All I care about is ‘Esc’ key as I use it heavily in the text editor, and that’s going to stay with the ‘Touch Bar’. Touch Bar is going to expand the functionality of the keyboard and applications and give me more control over features. In fact it creates new ways to interact with apps, without having to lift your fingers from the keyboard area. I love the new Touch Bar. The hidden secrets of MacBook Pro Trackpad Let me say this straight out: Apple is the only company that got the touch pad right. I have yet to come across a non-Apple laptop where trackpad is nothing more than an extension of the mouse. With the new MacBook, the trackpad is doubled in size. In addition, there is a secret that most people don’t know: with the new force field touch pads, you can convert it into a tablet by using a stylus. Apps like Inklet allow you to enjoy pressure sensitivity so all those aspiring graphic artists don’t need to buy expensive tablets. I can’t tell you how excited I am about it. They don't have touchscreen As a Chromebook Flip and Dell XPS 13 user, I can tell you touchscreens on laptops are pure waste. No one uses them. Touch screens do make sense for those devices that lack keyboard and mouse, but not on laptops. Also these touchscreens work more or less like input devices, like a mouse, so unlike iPad or Surface Pro like devices, you really can’t use them for drawing due to lack of palm rejection, it’s counterproductive. So, no, I don’t need touchscreen on my laptop. MacBooks are expensive I often hear people say Apple products are overpriced. May I ask what wasthe price of Chromebook Pixel? You get 32GB of storage for $1600. Check out laptops from Dell, HP, Lenovo … look at any vendor out there  matching the MacBook specs and you are talking about over $2000. You still get the crappy touchpad and Windows 10 that doesn’t scale apps very well for HiDPI monitors….and I won’t get into the 45 minute long downtime every time there is a system update. Yes, you can get a laptop under $300 but don’t complain about creaky hinges, unresponsive touchpad, 3Kg of weight and 4GB of RAM. The bottom line is good hardware is expensive. Just check the price of Pixel XL phone. It’s the same price of MacBook Air. Resistance to change Apple is finally pushing  laptops into new territories. Unlike Ubuntu Linux or Gnome, it’s not creating new interfaces that require users to relearn everything. It’s sticking to the WIMP paradigm and yet making game-changing improvements to hardware. That’s what we need. In all these years, the only innovation that we saw in the non-Apple market was more RAM and new CPUs. Period. Apple is pushing the envelope. I think the latest MacBook Pro is the rightful successor and I will be buying one. If you have any doubts, don’t listen to critics and get one. You won’t regret it. Trust me.

Beyond the reviews, Phil Schiller or Phil the Philosopher is back on his stump preaching the Gospel of Apple about how touch displays are a temptation of the devil. It reminds me of the line in the movie Poltergeist, just don't look into the light! I've always liked Phil Schiller and was glad that Steve Jobs kept him on board as he cleaned house back in 1997. But at times I'd prefer if Phil just focused on what Apple does best without having to preach to me that what I may like is wrong. Apple sometimes reminds me of Hillary Clinton and the Democrats saying that if I'm not for open borders and allowing all illegals to flood into the country and stay, then I must be a racist xenophobe or at best a deplorable. It's what turned off many independents. She should have stayed on message of why to vote for her rather then telling me that I represented the dark side if I happened to disagree with her point of view. Sometimes Apple gets a little too preachy. Many Apple pros are still seething that the new MacBook Pro limits ports and forces them to use dongles. And Apple just decided they no longer wanted to support an SD Slot. Apple's apostles tell us that an SD slot is a tool of the devil and if we wanted it, then we'd surely turn into pillars of salt. So repent and go there no more.   A Few Quick Review Flashes on the Touch Bar   In Mossberg's review he notes that "I have reservations, and you should too. Many pro users are already vocally complaining about issues particular to them. But, even for mainstream Mac users, there are questions about price, ports, the Touch Bar feature, the keyboard and — surprisingly, for a Mac — battery life. Mossberg really slams Apple on battery life. On the Touch Bar, Mossberg notes that "I don't think the Touch Bar is a gimmick, but I don't think it changes much, at least yet, for everyday Mac users. The Touch Bar has potential, but it's not magic." Mossberg finally says that "if you're a Mac devotee ready to move past the Air — not back to a lower-powered MacBook — this is what Apple is offering. Take it or leave it." It's certainly a mixed review that you could fully check out here.   The Wall Street Journal's review by Joanna Stern starts off in your face: "We've been conditioned: Every new Apple Product is the best Apple Product ever… until, of course, the next best Apple Product ever. The exception? The new MacBook Pro laptops.   Even if you have enough spare cash to buy a Tesla for your kitten, it isn't abundantly clear that you should choose one of the new $1,500-and-up models over their predecessors. The new models even defy our expectations on power and pricing. Not only are they missing the newest Intel chipset, they don't even fit in the standard Apple-nomics model where hot new products slot in at last year's pricing.   On the Touch Bar Stern noted that "I can accomplish many shortcuts faster with the keyboard or trackpad. (Example: Cmd-B bolds words quicker than I can lift a finger to hit the Touch Bar's little "B.") Plus, you always have to look up since the controls keep changing and your sense of touch doesn't help at all."   The Bottom Line for Stern is one not to offend. Stern notes "So how do you decide? Do you invest in the present—the "old" MacBook Pro with performance, good-enough portability, a keyboard to cherish and lots of ports? Or do you invest in the future—a beautiful, highly portable machine with new tricks? Or maybe you do what I'm doing: Stare down at your three-year-old laptop and wonder if you can tough it out another year or two while this sorts itself out." Click here For more on the WSJ review.   Engadget's review by Dana Wollman was brutally honest. Dana notes that "I'm one of many Mac owners out there who has been waiting for Apple to upgrade the MacBook Pro line. Now that it finally has, I find the new laptop isn't quite what I wanted.   For me, this is both a step forward and a step backward. I'm sure Apple disagrees, and not just because its job is to sell lots of computers. Apple seems to earnestly believe it knows how people should be getting work done -- so much so that it has the chutzpah to ask loyal customers to unlearn old habits. Get used to using dongles to attach your existing accessories. Say goodbye to your memory card slot, creatives. Resign yourself to adjusting the brightness or volume with taps and swipes, instead of a simple button press. Accept the risk that your existing Thunderbolt 3 peripherals might not work.   On the Touch Bar, Wollman notes that "What's annoying about this whole setup is that either way, some of the most important system controls are now buried in Touch Bar menus. Want to lower the volume? You can either hit the volume icon and hit the slider, or hit the arrow key and tap the volume up or down key. That's less efficient than just pressing a dedicated volume button in the function row. It's inconvenient enough that I eventually started using my mouse to do things like pause Spotify or raise the volume on a track. Apple made me change my way of doing things, and not necessarily for the better. That pisses me off."   Although Wollman complains, she knows that die-hard Apple will flock to it and it gives it a decent 8 out of 10 score.   On the Touch Bar, the review by The Verge was mixed. "I've been using the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar for more than a week now, and I have mixed feelings about what it brings to the MacBook experience. In some cases, the Touch Bar's usefulness is obvious and immediate. But in many others, it's overly complicated or just plain unnecessary. It's an addition that very much can improve every MacBook — but it's going to take some time to get there, if it ever does."   Phil the Philosopher   Back in 2012 Samsung's Phablet had been out for about a year and Apple's VP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller wanted to downplay what many consumers were running to, the Phablet. So Schiller put on his preacher's robe and went into Phil the Philosopher mode. Patently Apple's report at the time noted that "In Describing the new iPhone, Phil Schiller stated that "It is really easy to make a new product that's bigger. Everyone does that. The challenge is to make it better and smaller."   Schiller went on to make an obvious point that Samsung forgot: "What is the design center for a Phone? It's this: it's your hand. A phone should feel great in your hand and more importantly it should be easy to use with a magical device we all carry called the horizontally opposed thumb. It does most of the hard work for us. So when you carry your phone it should feel beautiful in your hand."   As one who liked the phablet idea right out of the gate, I found it funny to listen to Phil having to defend Apple's position. More more importantly, Phil basically tried to convey the message that we just didn't get it, and if we happened to like a phablet, then surely we had lost our way.   According to Phil, my thumb had to be satisfied and that could only happen on a tiny iPhone display. Keep in mind that this isn't me conveniently looking back with 20/20 hindsight. I reported on this back in 2013 after Apple had missed delivering a phablet for a second year in a row in a report titled "Apple Passing on a larger iPhone Display still a Head Scratcher."   Well, Apple is back at it again and Phil the Philosopher is there to just lay down the law and to set us all straight. When it came to dropping ports and the SD slot that Pro users loved, Phil was there to slap them on that back and make it very clear that Apple cares "about what they love and what they are worried about. And it's our job to help people through these changes." Yes, true, at a cost and inconvenience of having multiple dongs on our desks like our cover graphic illustrates. That's helping us through the changes? Ka-ching for Apple.   It's not what Apple fans or pros wanted from a new MacBook Pro, but hey, Phil will help us through these changes because we're all just morons who just don't get it. We just don't see the light of genius in changing every port so that they look alike and are more importantly, nice and neat in a row! You know, it's just so condescending and yet I'm sure it's done with a smile. Thanks Phil.   Of course the biggest in our face position that Apple won't budge on is giving us a MacBook or iMac with a touch display. That argument should be dead by now but the tech community of writers never let it go. It's obvious that these writers and Apple fans would still like to see that come to be. But Apple continues to say that god handed them down the law on stone tablets like Moses. Phil, it's doable because Windows 10 proved it's doable so it just comes down to ideology and not because it's absurd as you claim it to be.    You know, it reminds me of people who have to eat each thing on their plate in a particular order never mixing a damn thing. Their brain isn't wired to enjoy peas and potatoes together in one scoop. It just isn't the order of things in their universe.   In a new report today Phil told Backchannel that "We think of the whole platform. If we were to do Multi-Touch on the screen of the notebook, that wouldn't be enough — then the desktop wouldn't work that way." And touch on the desktop, he says, would be a disaster. Can you imagine a 27-inch iMac where you have to reach over the air to try to touch and do things? That becomes absurd."   How many times have I been at my kitchen table in the evening and just leaned over to touch the Safari or iTunes icon on my iMac like I do on my iPad to launch an app, just to laugh at what I was doing because my iMac was of course just too stupid to do that. What was I thinking, that we could have it both ways like on Windows devices?   Yet at the end of the day, most Apple fans will appreciate Apple's MacBook Pro with its new Touch Bar. On the other hand, many reviewers and fans couldn't care less about the Touch Bar, and some like me would still prefer a hybrid notebook-tablet like the invention that Apple's engineers came up with; their intelligent engineers that had their idea stolen from them by Microsoft's Surface Book. But when I get a Surface Book someday in the future, I'll always think of those Apple engineers and say thanks guys, too bad Apple didn't listen to you because it was a great idea.     Roundup of More In-Depth MacBook Pro Reviews   Philosophy aside, if you're trying to decide on whether to pass or buy that shiny new MacBook Pro for Christmas and need a nudge either way, below are a few more interesting and more in-depth reviews that might help you decide:   Ars Technica: Touch Bar MacBook Pros give an expensive glimpse at the Mac's future USA Today: MacBook Pro review: Touch Bar comes at high cost AppleInsider: Review: Apple's late-2016 15" MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Gizmodo: The MacBook Pro's Touch Bar Is a Gimmick That's Not Worth the Money (Yet) Mashable: Apple's MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is worth the wait Macworld: MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review: The best bits of iOS in a really great Mac --- They love the new Touch Bar as noted below in their overview video.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

As with other external graphics enclosures, the AKiTiO Node allows a user to easily upgrade the graphics sub-system of notebook, AIO or SFF PCs that have a Thunderbolt 3 port by using a discrete graphics card. One of the key elements to eGFX is price and look, and AKiTiO has placed the Node at $299, but itcan fit graphics cards with massive coolers. Enthusiasts started to experiment with external graphics over Thunderbolt 2 interface several years ago after multiple attempts of companies like ATI/AMD, ASUS and some others to develop commercial external GPU technologies had failed. Back in 2014, plugging a video card to a MacBook Pro using Thunderbolt 2 was costly: users had to buy a chassis for up to $1000 (there were cheaper methods, but they did not look solid), a PSU and a graphics board. The homebrew method worked, but had a number of limitations when it came to bandwidth, hot-plugging (more importantly, unplugging), driver support and some others, not to mention the aesthetics of such eGFX setups. Given the trend towards miniaturization of mobile and desktop PCs, the idea of external graphics was far too alluring to skip, which is why Intel decided to support it with its Thunderbolt 3 technology introduced in 2014. While technically TB3 is PCIe 3.0 x4 over a cable, to properly enable operation of external GPUs, Intel and its allies had to ensure support of eGFX hardware though operating systems, GPU drivers, firmware and so on. Earlier this year all pieces of the puzzle finally came together and the first “official” TB3 eGFX chassis were introduced by Razer and PowerColor. While both Razer Core and PowerColor Devil Box do the job and even feature a couple of extras, they are rather expensive as they add more than just GPU features - $499 and $379, respectively. This week, AKiTiO, which has been offering external Thunderbolt enclosures for years, introduced its eGFX box that costs $299.99.

The Node comes with an integrated 400 W SFX PSU (which means that it can be upgraded) as well as one 120 mm fan. As for dimensions, the Node seems to be a little more spacious inside than its rivals, which is good for cooling and compatibility with custom video cards (such as those from ASUS or EVGA). Despite this, GPUs with hybrid cooling (integrated liquid cooling) are not supported, such as AMD Radeon R9 Fury X.

It does not have extra USB 3.0 ports (to connect a VR headset, for example), a GbE controller nor a SATA connector. This naturally cuts down its costs and allows Akito to sell the eGFX enclosure at $299 price-point, but additional USB ports will be greatly missed by owners of ultra-thin laptops as well as SFF PCs. AKiTiO plans to start selling the Node (NODE-T3IA-AKTU) in December.

POST A COMMENT 47 Comments View All Comments jsntech - Monday, November 14, 2016 - link In my opinion, this is the future of a pretty decent slice of the market. The emergence of several of these (especially like this one with a standard TB3 connection) is pretty encouraging. Not holding my breath, but sure would also be nice if Apple ever decided to create drivers supporting eGPUs...might actually provide incentive for developers to consider macOS for more demanding GPU-intensive applications (dare I say, VR?). Like I said, not holding my breath... Reply MadDuffy - Monday, November 14, 2016 - link I'd have agreed with you when thunderbolt came out and the potential seemed so high (five years ago). But now we have faster wireless networking and streaming tech, so these boxes aren't reasonable for most gaming purposes when you could just spend 300 dollars and get a desktop. Reply MadDuffy - Monday, November 14, 2016 - link Competition is good, though. Get the prices down! Reply rhysiam - Monday, November 14, 2016 - link Does anyone know what Intel is actually charging for the TB3 controllers? It must be a lot, because we still only see TB on higher end mobos and portables. That seems like it's going to be the biggest problem for this market. If you can pop one of these boxes into just about any modern laptop, then they've got a good chance. But if things stay as they are now, and you have to carefully choose and pay more for a TB3 laptop, then overpay for these enclosures (you could literally buy a case, PSU & entire motherboard for half the price of this TB3 enclosure)... then I can't see these ever becoming anything other than niche products suiting people who are prepared to pay significantly more for the particular benefits they bring. The other problem, I suspect, is that we're seeing an increasing number of manufacturers producing pretty competent portable gaming laptops. Some of the recent 14" & 15" inch laptops with GTX 1060s, while of course bulkier than an ultrabook, still manage to be both relatively portable (~2/3" thick and under 4lbs) and extremely competent gaming machines. Many, as well, do this while costing far less in a single package than the laptop + GPU enclosure + GPU approach. We no longer live in a world where the only competent gaming laptops are 12lbs+ monstrosities. Obviously there's a market for these enclosures, it just seems that with capable ~4lb gaming laptops, it's a pretty niche market. Reply twtech - Monday, November 14, 2016 - link I think the best use for these is paired with an ultrabook that has a capable CPU but uses integrated graphics. The ultrabook has long battery life so you can do the types of basic tasks you typically want to be able to do while mobile - browse the internet, check email, work on documents, etc. Then when you want to sit down and play a game - which you'd usually do plugged in anyway - you plug into an external box like this (but preferably with those additional ports), that charges your laptop, provides connectivity for your external monitors, input devices, add-on storage for your game library, etc. So basically you can get the best of both worlds. I'm saying this from the perspective of someone who has owned gaming laptops in the past, and never really had a need or desire to use them as such while travelling - but I did wish I had better battery life and a more portable machine.

With an external GPU I could game on it at home in high quality. $300 for an enclosure is painful, though. I lost the link but a while ago I saw an external adapter, not an enclosure, that was about $130 with external PSU. Reply bronan - Tuesday, November 15, 2016 - link You actually should read the test reviews it does not do wonders at all. If you expect desktop performance you better buy a real home pc and put in a decent card which performs as it should. You get mediocre laptop performance even if you put a monster card in that box. Reply negusp - Tuesday, November 15, 2016 - link BS. It does do wonders for CPU-capable machines/laptops. The Skull Canyon NUC has a very capable CPU, and an external GPU would run just as fast as a normal GPU connected via PCI-E.

The former minister under whose watch the National Health Insurance was introduced is indicating that the biometric device has not been programmed to track voters in the entire constituency of the various polling centres hence, a voter can still have his or her details in other polling stations within the same constituency after voting at his or her original polling centre. It, therefore, opens the door for multiple voting, the former minister alleged while speaking in an interview with Kwame Tutu on Rainbow Radio. He said, unlike the Nigerian Biometric Verification system which is able to identify registered voters at all polling centres aside the original centre they registered, Ghana’s system, he noted, is volatile and could be a possible scheme to rig the process. According to him, it is an Intel he has picked and has therefore called on the Electoral Commission (EC) of Ghana to rectify the issue before the election takes off. Dr. Owusu Afriyie further admonished the EC to ensure that Ghanaians and their stakeholders, in particular, trust them in organising a clean, transparent and credible polls. The 2016 general elections, he noted, should be the exact representation of the electorates who will go to the polls to elect a leader of their choice and party with that fair process and for the EC to prevent any form of doubt that will may compromise the polls. The EC has assured Ghanaians that it will organise a clean, fair and credible elections. The first female commissioner of the EC, Mrs. Charlotte Osei, had said that every polling station will be allocated two biometric verification devices to avert the challenges that plagued the 2012 elections as a result of a breakdown of many of the machines. In 2012, some polling centres were forced to postpone voting because the verification device broke down. “If one has a problem or breaks down, we will switch to the second one. There is a backup we will bring from the constituency level to support that polling station,” the EC Chair explained. The EC chair added, “The reason being that we want fewer people on the register of every polling station so there is less pressure on the machines and less pressure on the personnel. Hopefully, voting will finish earlier and we can finish the collation earlier and declare the results.” The biometric system of voting was introduced in Ghana and was used in the 2012 presidential and parliamentary elections. Biometric voter registration involves use of computers, fingerprint scanners and digital cameras to capture the bio-data of applicants. Fingerprints are unique to every individual and it is these unique features and other details that will be stored in the computer from which the voters register is produced. The biometric system was introduced because the old form of voting was not able to detect multiple registrations.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News World's Largest Student Cyber Security Contest Names Winners BROOKLYN, N.Y., Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ — Students from high schools through doctoral programs throughout North America, the Middle East, North Africa, and India competed in the final rounds of the world’s largest student-run security games, the 13th annual New York University Cyber Security Awareness Week (NYU CSAW), held November 12-14, 2016. For the first time in the history of NYU CSAW, the final round of contests expanded beyond NYU Tandon School of Engineering in Downtown Brooklyn to regional hubs at NYU Abu Dhabi – for finalists from North Africa and the Middle East – and the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT Kanpur). Continue Reading To solve the fictional murder mystery posed in the 2016 NYU CSAW High School Forensics Contest, students had to examine evidence in an LG smart watch donated by Google. Cyber Security Awareness Week, the world’s largest student-run cybersecurity contests, was held Nov. 10-12 at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, NYU Abu Dhabi, and the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. Finalists bested more than 10,000 students from more than 100 countries who competed remotely in preliminary rounds of six separate competitions. The best high school cyber sleuths tangled in the final rounds for over $1 million in scholarships.  Additionally, the NYU Center for Cyber Security will offer doctoral scholarships and fellowships to the NYU Tandon School of Engineering to college-level finalists who prevailed against student hackers and researchers at NYU CSAW’s three hubs. Capture the Flag For the signature event of NYU CSAW, Capture the Flag (CTF), 34 teams from a preliminary field of more than 2,500 teams earned finalist slots in Brooklyn, Abu Dhabi, and Kanpur. Fifteen undergraduate teams in the United States, eight in the United Arab Emirates, and 11 in India competed in notoriously difficult final-round hacking challenges that lasted 36 consecutive hours. In Brooklyn, a CTF challenge created by tech firm Vector 35 required contestants to reverse engineer a derivation of the popular Pokémon Go game. Players had to hack the game so that they could amass in hours a score that would normally take weeks or even months to achieve. “To do that requires real-world network analysis and program reverse-engineering skills,” said Jordan Wiens, CTF judge and co-founder of Vector 35. “These are the same kinds of tools the data security world has a dramatic need for right now.” Unemployment in cybersecurity hovers near zero, and according to estimates by Cisco, there are one million cybersecurity job vacancies this year alone, including more than 200,000 in the United States. Frost & Sullivan, in an often-cited report, predicts 1.5 million unfilled security positions worldwide by 2020. The team 1064 Shellphish from the University of California (Santa Barbara) featured brothers Brandon and Andrew Dutcher. Andrew had competed in the CTF team 1064CBread, which won second place in 2015, when all members were graduates or students of Dos Pueblos High School in Goleta, California. John Grosen, who was also on that original 1064CBread team, is now a freshman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and competed with MIT’s CTF team Don’t Hack Alone. His brother Paul, who competed last year as a freshman on Dos Pueblos High School’s High School Forensics (HSF) team 1064CBread, returned this year as well. The team became the first HSF competitor to place in NYU CSAW’s rigorous Department of Homeland Security Quiz. For the eighth consecutive year in Brooklyn, a team from Carnegie Mellon took top honors in the CSAW CTF.

The challenge was designed by a team of top NYU security faculty and students mentored by NYU Assistant Professor Michail Maniatakos and Nektarios Tsoutsos, a computer science doctoral candidate studying under Maniatakos at NYU Abu Dhabi. Using special chipsets supplied by CSAW sponsor Intel, teams were tasked with modifying a configurable microchip to make it immune to memory corruption, a common attack used by hackers. To qualify for the final round, teams submitted papers describing the techniques they would use to enhance a basic chip design so that memory corruption could not harm the system. In Brooklyn, first place went to a team from the University of Central Florida (UCF), which has produced podium winners for the past five years. UCF fielded teams that won first place in 2014 and 2012, and second place last year and in 2013.

Closing NYU CSAW was Neil Hershfield, deputy section manager of Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, who spoke about the threat posed by control system malware and the dearth of analysts with control systems expertise. NYU students and volunteer judges spend months preparing challenges and organizing NYU CSAW, which has grown from an internal event at the school to one of the best known competitions for students. This year it was supported by 26 sponsors. For more information on CSAW, visit csaw.engineering.nyu.edu. Follow @CSAW_NYUTandon.

[x] Win a Gigabyte GTX 1070 G1 Gaming Bundle [x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: Laptop Reviews 5 Review: EVGA SC17 1070 Gaming Laptop by Parm Mann on 14 November 2016, 16:00 Tags: EVGA, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qadavt Add to My Vault: Page Jump: ========== 1 - Introduction 2 - Test Methodology 3 - Benchmarks: CPU 4 - Benchmarks: Memory 5 - Benchmarks: Storage 6 - Benchmarks: Gaming 7 - Benchmarks: Display 8 - Benchmarks: Temperature and Noise 9 - Benchmarks: Power Draw and Battery Life 10 - Conclusion Introduction We'd started to lose count of how many gaming laptops we reviewed in the first half of 2016 only to conclude that a next-gen GPU was needed in order to entice PC gamers into making an investment. Fast forward to today and Nvidia's GTX 10-series range has surfaced and manufacturers are all hurrying to introduce refreshed models. Quick off the mark is EVGA, who is giving its first-ever gaming laptop, the SC17, a makeover by swapping the GeForce GTX 980M found in the launch model for an up-to-date GeForce GTX 1070. The 10-series GPU is the headline announcement, and it seems little else has changed. We'd encourage readers to pore over our in-depth review of the launch SC17 for the finer details, as a lot of what was true back then is still applicable to the 1070 refresh. Dimensions haven't changed, with the 17.3in machine measuring 408mm x 296mm x 26.6mm, and the unit still tips the scales at a considerable 4.1kg. EVGA's aluminium frame offers a robust feel, yet while it's reasonably thin for a gaming laptop, the weight prevents it from being portable and the black paintwork continues to attract fingerprints en masse. From the outside, you'd do well to tell the models apart. The 1070 refresh looks identical with a power connector, Gigabit Ethernet, HDMI and two mini-DisplayPorts lining the left edge, as well as a headphone jack, two USB 3.0 ports and USB 3.1 Type-C on the right. Thunderbolt, an SD card reader and one or two more USB ports would have been nice on a system of this size, though EVGA does offer a USB Type-C-to-USB 3.0 adaptor as part of the bundle. All of the original SC17's highlights remain intact, including a 4K IPS display identified as the 17.3in Sharp SHP145E, a proper UEFI firmware that better resembles a desktop solution, and of course a 'SuperClock' mode that allows for the laptop to be overclocked via a quick keyboard shortcut. Such features offer genuine appeal to the target enthusiast audience, though if you were hoping to see a few other upgrades, you may be disappointed to find that G-Sync display technology still isn't an option. The sense of familiarity continues under the hood, where EVGA employs many of the same core components. Tucked into the svelte frame is an Intel Core i7-6820HK processor, 32GB (2x16GB) of G.Skill DDR4-2666 memory, a 256GB Samsung M.2 NVMe SSD, a 1TB hard disk and an Intel AC-8260 adapter for WiFi and Bluetooth. Nothing new there, but the big change of course is in the GPU department, with the outgoing GTX 980M having been replaced by the GeForce GTX 1070. The 16nm Pascal chip features one more SM unit than its desktop counterpart, resulting in 2,048 shaders and 128 texture units. Lower clock speeds balance things out, and in terms of performance, we've reached the point where the gap between desktop and mobile parts has all but disappeared. Turn the SC17 1070 on and the CPU and GPU are configured to default clock speeds of up to 3,600MHz and 1,645MHz, respectively. EVGA's party trick is a quick-and-easy overclock. Hit the SuperClock shortcut (Fn and Up Arrow) and the CPU is instantly lifted to 4,000MHz while the GPU's boost frequency climbs from 1,645MHz to 1,683MHz. No restart is required, and though power consumption, heat output and noise are all likely to increase, it's an easy way to eke out more performance when the going gets tough. Aside from the GPU, have there been any other significant changes? Well, the price tag isn't what it used to be. Whereas the original SC17 arrived at retail carrying a lofty £2,400 MSRP, the SC17 1070 has raised the asking fee to a jaw-dropping £2,900. For that amount of money you might anticipate a GTX 1080 and G-Sync as standard, but then, given that even Toblerone isn't what it used to be, perhaps we're just going to have to get used to paying more than expected?

Comments By Agam Shah Follow IDG News Service | Nov 14, 2016 11:20 AM PT RELATED TOPICS High Performance Computing (HPC) Computer Hardware Comments The fastest computer in the world today can deliver about 125 petaflops of performance, but that could quadruple in the coming years. Cray's XC50, announced Monday, can deliver a petaflop of performance in a single box, and up to 500 petaflops for an entire supercomputer. A supercomputer is typically multiple servers -- also called nodes -- strung together, combining to provide multiple petaflops of horsepower. So the XC50 needs to be specifically configured to hit 500-petaflop performance, an effort that could take a few years. There are multiple technologies that boost the performance of the XC50. It is compatible with Nvidia's Tesla P100 GPU and Intel's Xeon and Xeon Phi processors, which are both accelerators that speed up scientific computing tasks. A supercomputer in Switzerland called Piz Daint, which uses the older Cray XC30 design, has been upgraded to the XC50. It is the world's eighth-fastest supercomputer, according to a new list of the world's fastest systems released by Top500 on Monday. In-system upgrades to Piz Daint are ongoing, and the supercomputer will be merged with another, called Piz Dora. Once the supercomputers are combined and new components in place, Piz Daint will be one of the fastest supercomputers in the world, Cray claims. However, its performance numbers weren't provided by Cray. Cray's XC50 is one step ahead in a race to release supercomputers that can deliver an exaflop -- a million trillion calculations per second -- of performance. The world's fastest supercomputer is China's TaihuLight, which can deliver about 125 petaflops of performance, according to Top500. Piz Daint today has Intel's older Xeon E5-v3 processors, but will support Intel Xeon E5-v5 processors based on Skylake, coming out in the middle of next year. The new chips will bring tremendous performance increases. Processors alone can't speed up a computer's performance; speedy throughput, storage and networking are also important. The XC50 has an upgraded Aries interconnect, which is used in some of the world's fastest computers. The Aries interconnect topology enables multipoint communication among computing nodes in a supercomputer. The XC50 will also support SSD storage, which is now replacing hard drives. The supercomputer has smaller individual chassis, so cooling costs and power consumption for the supercomputer will be lower. Liquid cooling won't be required for XC50 supercomputers.

The new tech has a lot riding on its shoulders, so the question arises: how will it fare against other premium laptops? Advertisement The Surface Book i7 is the fastest Surface Book yet, offering twice the speed and power of the previous generation book, and providing a massive battery life, besting other laptops. Having said that, Microsoft didn't actually smoothen the sharp edges on the Surface Book i7, and that shows. The laptop has a 13.5 inch tablet, and it basically is a tablet with a keyboard. The laptop flexes itself using the middle magnesium bridge,  however, just like last year, the hinge that remains when you close the laptop may hurt the perfectionist in you. You may love it or hate it, but the fact doesn't change that the Book i7 is indeed the laptop you need. The screen is beautiful, with 3000 x 2000 pixels with a pixel density of 267 ppi, which results in comfortable viewing angles and deep vivid colors. From a design standpoint, Microsoft opted for a thicker laptop, as the top model of the Surface Book i7 with the Performance Base is slightly thicker compared to other premium mini laptops. The weight has slightly increased as well, but that is acceptable for the performance it provides. The powerhouse is run by a 6th gen Intel dual Core i7-6600U processor, with RAM options of 8GB and 16GB, and with SSD options ranging from 256GB to 1TB. If you follow Microsoft news, you would know that the Surface Pro 5 might come with the Kaby Lake CPU architecture. However, Microsoft went with the current gen Skylake CPU architecture, and instead they improved the graphics performance. Advertisement The GPU has been revamped and this makes the Book i7 attractive to gamers and designers. There is an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 965M GPU, versus the previous gen's GeForce 940M series. The graphics memory also has been doubled to a 2GB GDDR5 RAM, which translates to faster graphics processing. In fact, the Surface Book i7 has had no multitasking issues so far, no matter how heavy games we try to run on it, and swap it with heavy background running programs. Skylake CPUs are at least 10% slower than 7th gen Kaby Lake CPUs, but for a normal user, you would hardly feel that difference if you haven't used any Kaby Lake laptop. As for the performance, the Surface Book i7 is a seriously fast laptop, faster than its predecessor, but not as fast as the competition. What makes it different from the rest is the pen, which is tactile and helps in doing most, if not all design tasks. As for gaming, it can run even the most demanding games in medium to high settings, as it can the Tomb Raider of 2013 in 1920x1080 at 80 frames per second. The battery life as well, is stupendously huge, and with 786 minutes of 4K video playback and 709 minutes of online streaming, it trashes its competition. The price of the laptop is a little higher, with $2,399 for the base model and $3,299 for the top model, meaning it is priced slightly higher than the entry level Macbook Pro with TouchBar. This is its biggest downside. For this amount of money, you can find a high end Windows laptop and a tab as well. However, in conclusion, this is a decent tech, as the usability of this laptop shines when you have to move it around. You can detach it, sketch designs, reattach it and do regular laptop tasks. This flawless transition is where the Surface Book shines.

PC-Tablet Videos Tech Apps Telecom Science Business Social Auto Reviews How-To’s Featured Microsoft Surface Phone 2017: Upcoming smartphone to rival iPhone 8 and Samsung Galaxy S8 By Anand Narayanaswamy - 14/11/2016 Microsoft Surface Phone is the highly anticipated smartphone coming in 2017. If rumors are to be believed, the entry level variant of Microsoft Surface Phone will be equipped with Snapdragon 830 processor and 4GB RAM. Microsoft is gearing up to release the new smartphone, which is tipped to bring the Redmond-based software giant back to the smartphone segment. After the huge failure of Lumia series, Microsoft has done a great amount of research to build a new smartphone which will meet the expectations of users. To tackle the acute competition from various manufacturers, Microsoft is planning to go big with the upcoming Surface Phone. Microsoft Surface Phone Specifications Talking about the hardware segment, the new Microsoft Surface Phone will ship in three RAM variants with 4GB being the entry level. According to rumors, you can expect 6GB and 8GB RAM variants. It is also being rumored that the default internal storage space of the Microsoft Surface Phone will be 128GB storage space. If this rumor turns out to be true, it is will be a big game changer since Apple is expected to infuse 32GB as the default storage for the iPhone 7. There are reports that the 6GB RAM model of Surface Phone will bear a storage capacity of 256GB. If you look at the existing premium smartphones, you will be able to crank up to 256GB storage only using microSD cards. What we gathered from the rumor mills is that the Microsoft Surface Phone will have a total storage capacity of 512GB for the 8GB RAM edition. This smartphone is oriented for advanced users and developers. A while back an image leaked which shows that the phone will ship with a Snapdragon 830 processor, 5.7-inch display with 2K resolution. Moreover, the rear camera capacity has been mentioned as 20MP. Unless other competing manufacturers release smartphones with similar configurations, Microsoft will be the first device maker to offer such a massive specifications even in the budget segment. Possible Intel Processor, Software, and Release Date To increase processing power, Microsoft is reportedly looking forward to integrating an Intel processor. Earlier, there were reports of Microsoft making use of Atom X3 for the new flagship. However, Microsoft’s plan got a setback when Intel cancelled the production of the processor. According to sources, Microsoft has already shelved the idea to bundle Intel processor. Instead, the company is planning to make use of the Snapdragon 830 processor for the Surface Phone. There are reports that the new Surface Phone will be equipped with Intel Kaby Lake processor, which will have enhanced performance. We expect Microsoft to ship Surface Phones with the latest Windows 10 Mobile. The main problem with Microsoft devices is the inability to upgrade the software smoothly. If Microsoft bundles the Surface Phone with Windows 10 and later on doesn’t ships any updates, then the company will lose its charm among future customers. This is what happened to Zune music player and Lumia smartphones. Microsoft will release Surface Phone by the end of March 2017.

Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today The first-generation Microsoft Surface Book produced a certain level of success for the giant software company last year — just enough for it to consider building a new one this year. And although all eyes are currently on the recently released Microsoft Surface Book i7, there is very little doubt that the second-generation device is coming very soon. According to reports, there is wide speculation that the upcoming 2-in-1 detachable will be released late next year, owing to the notion that it will be coming with a major redesign as well as Intel's much-publicized Kaby Lake processor. Considering that a major redesign is in place, it is therefore too difficult to project a release for this year since there only are about six weeks left before 2016 ends. Specifications-wise, a recent CNET report said that the new Surface Book will finally be equipped with better battery capacity, essentially addressing the biggest drawback of last year's edition. This time, at least 16 hours of battery life is promised, although that remains unconfirmed. The same report claimed that there will be a couple of USB 3.0 ports, a traditional headphone jack, mini DisplayPort, and a 13.5-inch screen with PixelSense technology. The reason why there is a priority to use the Intel Kaby Lake processor is because Microsoft wants the guarantee that the Surface Book 2 will have Thunderbolt 3 support as well as USB Type-C connectivity. Also, it's safe to bet that a 4K resolution is in play as well, considering that anything less than 4K for this hybrid computer's resolution is tantamount to disappointment. If Microsoft wants to market it as the company's flagship computing device, it needs to be capable of 4K video playback, to say the least. For the meantime, though, there is very little chance that the Surface Book 2 will get its release this year since Microsoft wants to focus its marketing efforts on selling the recently launched Surface Book i7 variant.

Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today Many tech enthusiasts were disappointed last October when Microsoft did not showcase the much awaited Surface Pro 5. The hybrid laptop's present iteration, the Surface Pro 4, has been in the market for almost a year, and the public believes that the release of Surface Pro 5 is long overdue. While the October hardware event presented the latest additions to Microsoft's Surface family, namely the all-in-one (AIO) Surface desktop computer and the upgraded Surface Book, there are still no details to confirm the Surface Pro 5's arrival. Nevertheless, the rumors are rife that the Surface Pro 5 will be released in the coming months. According to Headlines and Global News, the Surface Pro 5 is likely to be released in the first quarter of 2017. Earlier rumors suggested that the Surface Pro 5 would be released during the last quarter of this year, but with the device being a no-show at the last hardware event of Microsoft this 2016, this is no longer expected to happen. It appears that the Surface Pro 5 is not intended to be released this year, as the Redmond-based tech giant has a lot of things to arrange before they could present the refreshed Surface Pro to the public. iDigital Times reported that the Surface Pro 5 will be powered by the next generation Intel Kaby Lake processor. The inclusion of the Kaby Lake chipset to the core specs of the Surface Pro 5 is seen as one of the main reasons Microsoft could not release the hybrid laptop this year. Intel is still not expected to be finished shipping the Kaby Lake chipsets necessary to develop the Surface Pro 5 units. For now, it is expected that the Intel Kaby Lake will be ready by the end of 2016, and Microsoft will finish the production of Surface Pro 5 during the first quarter of the coming year. As per Tech Times, the Surface Pro 5 will receive a 12.3-inch PixelSense screen panel. Particularly, the base variant of the Surface Pro 5 will have at least 2K resolution while the high-tier model will boast full 4K UHD resolution. Along with the powerful Intel Kaby Lake processor, the Surface Pro 5 will have at least 16 GB RAM for the base model.

Comments CIO | Nov 14, 2016 8:00 AM PT Like this article? thumbsup +1 thumbsdown RELATED TOPICS Mobile MacBooks Hardware Comments Apple’s recent announcement of new MacBook Pros with a Touch Bar caught the attention of many Mac users who have been waiting a long time to upgrade their laptops. Potential buyers of these new MacBook Pros have been wondering if the new Touch Bar feature is worth the money Apple is asking for the new computers. That's a very valid concern considering that the MacBook Pros with Touch Bar start at $1799 for the 13-inch model and $2399 for the 15-inch model, and go for $1999 for the higher-end 13-inch model and a whopping $2799 for the higher-end 15-inch version. Fortunately, reviews have started to come out of the MacBook Pros with Touch Bar and I’ve compiled a helpful roundup to assist you in making your buying decision. The Verge: A touch of the future Jacob Kastrenakes at The Verge noted that the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is a taste of the future but that that future isn’t quite here yet: I may come off sounding quite critical of the new MacBook Pro, but the truth is that I really do like it. The hardware is incredible, macOS is a joy to use, and I don’t want to give up this screen and keyboard. It’s a fantastic laptop on build alone. But everywhere I look, it feels like this incarnation of the MacBook Pro is shooting for a future it can’t quite reach. One where it can be impressively thin and powerful enough for the pros. Where it can be super light and have all-day battery life. Where its ports and keyboard morph and adapt perfectly to the needs of every user. I have little doubt that in a couple years, the technology Apple has been waiting for will arrive and this vision, or something closer to it, will be complete. Apple just released this machine too soon, or was too aggressive in the decisions it made. That future is almost certainly out there. But it’s not in this machine. Not yet. More at The Verge Ars Technica: Touch Bar, Touch ID, dedicated GPUs, more ports, and a whole lot more Andrew Cunningham at Ars Technica indicated that the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has much to offer certain users but that it comes with a high price tag: If you’ve got a MacBook Pro that you bought in 2012 or earlier and if you’re convinced of the potential utility and novelty of the Touch Bar, these 2016 MacBook Pros were just about worth the wait. Replace a four- or five-year-old laptop with one of these and you’ll get a great new design, a respectable performance boost, a nice screen, the single most versatile port you can get in any computer, and a new input device that tries to combine the good stuff about PC touchscreens (fast response, malleable button layouts) while avoiding the bad stuff about PC touchscreens (adapting a mouse-and-keyboard driven operating system to finger input, blocking the screen by poking at it with your hand). The main problem at this point isn’t that the Touch Bar is a bad idea, but that these laptops cost a whole bunch of money. Great, premium PC laptops are available for half this price, even if Apple still maintains an edge when it comes to graphics and SSD speeds. It really feels like the Touch Bar needs to be included in the £1,450 model, and that versions of the new designs without Touch Bars should be the entry level systems—right now, Apple’s entry-level Mac laptops were all released in mid 2015, and that’s only going to get more embarrassing as time moves on. The other problem, and one that resonates for the rest of the PC industry, is that if you bought a MacBook Pro in 2013 or later there’s really very little reason to consider a new MacBook Pro. Intel’s processors deliver much better battery life than they used to, but the company’s new CPU architectures barely push performance forward and there are ever-wider gaps between new releases as it gets more difficult to move to better manufacturing processes. I like these laptops a lot. I bought one to replace my 2013 MacBook Air, which still performs basically fine but doesn’t have the sharp screen or design chops of the PC laptops that have come out in the last two-or-so years. But the rest of the Mac lineup—all of the desktops and the more affordable laptops—are still stuck in the past. It feels like Apple might have a comprehensive vision for the future of its computers, but that it’s only ready to show us a small, expensive peek right now. The sooner the Touch Bar and USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 can spread across the entire lineup and end this awkward transitional phase, the better. The good Nice new designs that are thinner and lighter than their predecessors. Four Thunderbolt 3 ports each, two on each side—this is super convenient for charging, especially. Low-travel keyboard still isn't for everyone, but it's a marked improvement over the first-generation version in the MacBook. Good battery life. Industry-leading storage performance. Non-terrible laptop speakers. 1.3Gbps Wi-Fi, unlike the £1,450 version. The bad 13-inch Touch Bar model doesn't have the same battery life as the non-Touch Bar model. Extremely limited repairability and upgradeability. Intel's CPU speed increases in the last few years have been discouraging. Need for dongles will be inconvenient, especially at first. The ugly Expensive, even for Macs. More at Ars Technica Engadget: A step forward and a step back Dana Wollman at Engadget found that the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar wasn’t quite what she wanted, and that she missed her function keys: I’m one of many Mac owners out there who has been waiting for Apple to upgrade the MacBook Pro line. Now that it finally has, I find the new laptop isn’t quite what I wanted. For me, the ideal MacBook Pro is actually a mashup between this and last year’s model. Let me keep my full-size USB ports, and my function keys, and my longer battery life, but stick with this thinner and lighter design. Stick with this improved display, Touch ID sensor, fast disk performance and more robust audio quality. For me, this is both a step forward and a step backward. I’m sure Apple disagrees, and not just because its job is to sell lots of computers. Apple seems to earnestly believe it knows how people should be getting work done – so much so that it has the chutzpah to ask loyal customers to unlearn old habits. Get used to using dongles to attach your existing accessories. Say goodbye to your memory card slot, creatives. Resign yourself to adjusting the brightness or volume with taps and swipes, instead of a simple button press. Accept the risk that your existing Thunderbolt 3 peripherals might not work. As I said, there’s ultimately a lot to like about the new MacBook Pro. But it’s designed for someone who I’m not sure exists outside Apple’s fantasies of how professionals use computers. The MacBook Pro I want to see is built around real people’s work habits. I still recommend it, and I imagine many of you who have been waiting patiently will indeed buy this. But I’d enjoy it more if it were designed for people like us. More at Engadget Six Colors: A keyboard chameleon Jason Snell at Six Colors was initially skeptical about the Touch Bar in the new MacBook Pro but warmed up to it after using it for a while: I was skeptical of the Touch Bar when it was first rumored, but it’s obvious that Apple has taken great care in refining the concept to focus it on being a contextual extension of the keyboard rather than a very squat iPad. Apple’s implementation of the Touch Bar interface in its apps vary from incredibly detailed to more generic, but I expect that over the next year or two we’ll all learn more about what makes an effective Touch Bar interface and what doesn’t. My gut feeling is that some of the more ambitious, complex interfaces will prove to be less useful than quick shortcuts, and that customization will be invaluable. But we won’t know until we try. If the Touch ID sensor is a little less exciting, that’s because it’s so familiar from iOS that it doesn’t seem that unusual to encounter it on the Mac. And I do like reducing the number of times I need to type in my password. I’m also happy that this is brand-new Apple hardware that’s immediately accessible by third-party software developers, which should limit the really awkward period where early adopters rush to a new feature only to find it supported by Apple but with no hope for more until the next year’s OS update. So who says there’s nothing new under the sun? Here’s a new dimension added to the Mac, with a debt owed to iOS, but undeniably its own approach. It never forgets it’s a companion to the keyboard and trackpad, but adds more flexibility than a static keyboard ever could. I’m looking forward to seeing how it evolves—and I have to admit, I kind of want one to place above the top row of my own external Mac keyboard now. I never felt that way about function keys. More at Six Colors TechCrunch: The Touch Bar is a nice bonus Brian Heater at TechCrunch liked the Touch Bar but noted that the spec bump in the new MacBook Pro was the biggest draw for him: The less celebrated spec bumps are what make the new Pro a worthy upgrade, particularly for those who, like me, have been suffering through their old system’s death rattles (or fan buzzing, at least), waiting for a significant update from the company. Better processors, more storage, a brighter display and better speakers are all wrapped up in a sleeker and lighter package than before. The Touch Bar feels like a nice bonus for the time being. It’s a compelling new input device that has the potential to alter the way we interact with applications on a laptop. In this early stage, it’s a cool feature that further distinguishes the Pro from other similarly spec-ed laptops, proving most useful in the consumption and creation of media like video, audio and images — all part of the creative professional demographic that has long served as one of the company’s core user bases. As Apple and third-party developers continue to play around with the form, its usefulness will only continue to grow. And perhaps it won’t be too long before we start seeing desktop applications built with the Touch Bar in mind, rather than adding such functionality in hindsight. The addition of Touch ID, however, has some immediately welcome functionality, including more secure startups and purchasing. And, as ever, the new MacBook Pro doesn’t come cheap, with a starting price of $1,799 (for the 13-inch Touch Bar version) all the way up through the fully packed model that goes well north of $4K. But let’s be honest, users have never bought Macs because of their rock-bottom prices. For those who have been holding out on buying a new MacBook, the time is right, with an upgrade that should be sufficiently future-proof to take on the next few years — or however long it takes for the next major upgrade. Hopefully you’ve been saving up in the meantime.

By Sean Portnoy for Laptops & Desktops | November 6, 2016 -- 22:39 GMT (14:39 PST) | Topic: PCs No Apple iPad deals in the Staples Black Friday ad this year. As Black Friday draws within three weeks, the ad leaks are starting to pick up in pace. For tech buyers, the Staples Black Friday ad leak may be the biggest so far, and it provides further evidence of an early trend: It's the latest retailer not to promote any deals on that former Black Friday stalwart -- Apple's iPad tablet. Part of that is due to Apple's stinginess on discounts in general, and part is due to the fading appetite of consumers for new tablets. Nevertheless, Staples still has the most tablet deals we've seen from a Black Friday ad this year, including matching BJ's Wholesale with a $33.33 special on the Amazon Fire 7-inch tablet. It goes one better by also having an Amazon Fire HD 8 slate on sale, but this is a case where a little research shows it's not as good a deal as advertised. Staples hypes the sale price of $79.99 as $50, but there are two oddities in the listing. First, Amazon itself lists the price of the Fire HD 8 as $89.99, not the $129.99 regular price Staples is claiming. Even more egregiously, the Fire model shown in the ad has only 8GB of storage, whereas the current base Amazon version comes with 16GB. In other words, Staples is trying to sell an older model with less storage for a mere $10 less than the current version, but touting massive savings. You've been warned. Black Friday 2016 CNET 2016 Holiday Gift Guide Microsoft preview promises deals on Surface devices, Windows laptops Hhgregg ad has 12.9-inch iPad Pro deal Office Depot/OfficeMax ad features $119 Windows 2-in-1 tablet, $169 HP laptop Best Buy ad reveals $100 Windows laptop deal, $125 iPad Air 2, Pro savings Walmart ad features $199 Apple iPad mini 2, $119 Chromebook deals Target ad has iPad Pro for $449, iPad Air 2 for $274 HP ad leaks with PC deals from $250 Staples ad leaks with laptops, tablet deals Costco ad leaks with laptop, desktop, tablet deals Ads for Dell Small Business leak BJ's Wholesale ad features $33.33 Amazon Fire tablet Sam's Club ad leaks with HP laptop, desktop deals Dell's ad leaks with $100 laptop, desktop deals Instead of iPads, the stores with Black Friday ad leaks have thus far listed Samsung Galaxy Tab discounts. Unfortunately for Staples, its specials are undercut by rivals: Its $99.99 price on the 7-inch Tab A is $10 more than in BJ's ad (and BJ's also throws in a 16GB microSD card), while its $129.99 price on the 8-inch Tab A is $10 more than in Costco's ad. Unlike its competitors, however, Staples has a sale on the budget-friendly 7-inch Galaxy Tab E Lite; at $69.99, it's actually $50 off the current price Samsung has on its site. But it's less successful with its $799 Surface Pro 4 pricing, which is $50 more for the same configuration as BJ's (though still $200 less than Microsoft's current price). As with Costco, Staples has a large number of Windows laptop deals for Black Friday, highlighted by a $229.99 HP 15-ay061 with Intel Pentium N3710 CPU, 8GB of RAM, 500GB hard drive, and 15.6-inch display. That's $90 less than the current price, not $190 as the ad states. In fact, this is the case with many of the PC sales Staples list: The price currently on its website is already reduced, meaning the savings are less whopping than its ad suggests. While there is no $100 laptop like Dell has for a doorbuster, there are four additional notebook specials for under $300: The Dell Inspiron I5555-0012 (AMD A8 processor, 6GB of RAM, 500GB hard drive, 15.6-inch display) for $269.99; a Dell Inspiron (Pentium CPU, 4GB of RAM, 500GB hard drive, 11.6-inch display) for $299.99, the HP 15-ay065 (Core i3-5005U, 6GB of RAM, 1TB hard drive, 15.6-inch display) for $299.99, and the Lenovo IdeaPad 100 (also Core i3-5005U, 4GB of RAM, 500GB hard drive, 15.6-inch display) for $299.99. In addition to those sales, there are 11 further laptop deals that Staples is advertising: $349.99 -- Dell Inspiron i5559-1350SLV (Core i3/6GB/1TB/15.6-inch) $389.99 -- HP Pavilion 14-al062 (Core i5/12GB/1TB/14-inch) $399.99 -- HP 14-al061nr (Core i3/8GB/1TB/14-inch) $399.99 -- HP 17-x061 (Core i3/8GB/1TB/17.3-inch) $449.99 -- Dell Inspiron 13 I5368-2405GRY (Core i3/8GB/500GB/13.3-inch full HD touchscreen) $449.99 -- Dell Inspiron i5559-3349SLVV (Core i5/8GB/128GB SSD/15.6-inch) $479.99 -- HP Pavilion 15-au062 (Core i5/8GB/1TB/15.6-inch-inch) $499.99 -- HP Pavilion 15-au063 (Core i7/12GB/1TB/14-inch) $499.99 -- Lenovo Flex 4 (Core i5/8GB/256GB SSD/14-inch full HD touchscreen) $599.99 -- Lenovo Ideapad 510 (Core i5/8GB/1TB/15.6-inch full HD) $629.99 -- HP Pavilion x360 15-bk010nr (Core i5/8GB/1TB/15.6-inch full HD touchscreen) There are also a half-dozen desktop deals split between towers and all-in-ones. The tower sales start at $279.99 ($70 less than current price) with the HP Slimline 260-p026, which comes with a Core i3-6100T processor, 8GB of RAM, and terabyte hard drive. Jumping up to $399.99 ($180 off) is the HP Pavilion 510-p026 with Core i5-6400T quad-core CPU, 12 gigs of RAM and 1TB hard drive, while the Dell Inspiron 3650 features a faster Core i5-6400 chip, 8GB of RAM, and 1TB of hard drive space for $449.99 -- though note you can get it for that price right now from Staples. As with the towers, the three all-in-one PC specials comprise a pair of HPs and a Dell. The HP 22-b016, with Intel Pentium processor, 4GB of RAM, terabyte hard drive, and 21.5-inch full HD display, is $299.99, or $80 off the current price, while the Pavilion 24-b016 comes a Core i3-6100T, 8 gigs of memory, 1TB hard drive, and 23.8-inch full HD screen for $449.99, or $50 less than the current price.

Image: Keith Arkins Photography A potentially game-changing asthma treatment project developed by a sixth-year Kildare student has taken the grand prize at SciFest 2016. With interest in SciFest 2016 beginning as early as January this year, the event backed by Science Foundation Ireland, Intel and Boston Scientific, is an all-island STEM initiative which fosters active, collaborative and inquiry-based learning among second-level students. Despite strong competition from across the country, Caolann Brady, a sixth-year student from St Wolstan’s Community School, Celbridge, Kildare has been named the overall winner of SciFest 2016, for her project ‘Hum your way to better health’. A tune to hum along to Born with asthma and knowing the effects of asthma attacks, Brady’s project focused on the natural treatment of the condition through humming and breathing techniques, as opposed to using inhalers and nebulisers. By starting with the knowledge of research that found the ventilation of the paranasal sinuses (inhaling and exhaling) increases greatly when a person practised specifically defined humming techniques, Brady went about testing it on 175 test subjects. She then asked the participants to hum into a paper bag at a precise pitch for 45 seconds, which yielded significant post and peak expiratory flow readings for an average of 45 minutes in a patient. The results, she found, showed that the prescribed humming technique improves lung function across the range of ages, genders and breathing capabilities by an average of 10pc with 99.9pc statistical confidence. Year to celebrate for girls and women This year’s award also marks a significant moment for the promotion of more participation of girls and women in science, as this was the first year that a girl had won the overall prize at SciFest 2016. Additionally, of the 58 students who exhibited their STEM projects at the national final, 65pc were girls and women. Brady will now have the honour of representing Ireland at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair 2017 in Los Angeles, California in January. In response to the projects on show at the awards, SciFest CEO Sheila Porter said: “The range of projects, and the creativity and innovation on display this year is really heartening and demonstrates that the students of today will be tomorrow’s leaders in the area of STEM. “The aim of SciFest is to foster and develop a love of STEM, and to imbue every student with the skills of self-directed learning.” In-Depth: More on Science Foundation Ireland Related: education, Boston Scientific, Intel, awards and recognition, Science Foundation Ireland Colm Gorey is a journalist with Siliconrepublic.com editorial@siliconrepublic.com You May Also Like You May Also Like Innovation Prof Mark Ferguson: Serial entrepreneurs are the lifeblood of Irish research 1 day ago10 Shares Hiring Now Join us to create the technology of tomorrow A dynamic and rapidly expanding company Help us change the way money works Be part of a globally successful team Innovation European AI expert Prof Barry O’Sullivan named SFI Researcher of the Year 2016 1 day ago105 Shares Innovation Insight’s Mike Conroy: ‘This is how we attack the mega trends’ 26 Oct 201626 Shares SUBSCRIBE TO OUR E-ZINE Sign up to receive weekly alerts bringing the best of Siliconrepublic.com straight to your inbox.

That’s not to say the Intel stock price has been a complete disappointment — INTC is up 188% from its early 2009 low. Rather, Intel has been a bit of a disappointment because the once-great company largely missed out on the advent of smartphones and mobile devices. Source: Intel Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) and a handful of other names have won that race thus far. For those owners of Intel stock who’ve been frustrated by how competitive the chipmaker hasn’t been of late though, fear not. The company is positioning to be much more competitive for the next few years than it has been for the past few years. Intel Stock Getting Back in the Game Broadly speaking, Intel just never had a product that filled the need when mobile technologies started to replace desktops and laptops. Chief among those needs is low power consumption. When an infinite supply of electricity is available through a wall outlet as it is for desktop computers, such efficiency is irrelevant. It’s mostly irrelevant for laptops and notebooks (though is increasingly a factor). For mobile phones and devices, though, where battery life is a huge consideration, power consumption can be a deal-breaker. The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2017 A close-second factor where Intel also largely missed the boat is condensing the size of its chipsets and thereby reducing the required size of motherboards that use them. To be fair, Intel did have entries in this race. The Atom X mobile chipset is one of them. Neither it nor any of its other efforts to gain a real foothold in the mobile market were big hits though. It’s not as if Intel has just been sitting back, unaware, however. Admittedly, it will require patience of Intel stock owners who are waiting to return to its glory days. The company’s got three ideas in the hopper, though, that may well be worth the wait. 1. Light-Based Data Center Processors If there’s one thing that was confirmed with last quarter’s results, it’s that data centers — server technologies — are becoming a very big deal for Intel. Specifically, its enterprise arm now accounts for half of the technology giant’s revenue, and its data center division saw 10% growth in third-quarter year-over-year revenue. And the company hasn’t even put the pedal to the metal yet. Recently it announced that it had successfully developed a chip that utilizes photonics … light rays or lasers, essentially. Not only would such a technology be quite power efficient, it would be stunningly fast. Intel says the total addressable market for its silicon photonics technology is on the order of $5 billion.

The good thing for investors is the Republican leaders in the House and the Senate probably will keep things from getting out of control, and the push by President-elect Trump for growth initiatives and tax cuts should help power old-school large cap growth stocks. That is a good thing for long-term investors with total return portfolios. We screened the UBS research universe for large cap growth stocks that pay dividends and that are rated Buy. We then screened for stocks that have been hit harder than some of their peers and may have bigger upside potential for investors now. General Electric This iconic blue chip industrial was on a roll but has sold off 15% since July and is giving investors a nice entry point. General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) is a highly diversified, global industrial corporation. Its businesses are organized broadly under six segments: GE Capital, Energy Infrastructure, Aviation, Healthcare, Transportation and Home & Business Solutions. Its products and services include power generation equipment, aircraft engines, locomotives, medical equipment, appliances, commercial leasing and personal finance. The company recently announced a huge deal to combine GE’s Oil & Gas business and Baker Hughes to create a leader in oil and gas equipment, technology and services. It will have $32 billion in revenue and can leverage GE’s digital and technology expertise and Baker Hughes domain knowledge, capabilities and presence in oilfield services. Most on Wall Street are very positive on this deal, which comes on the heels of a failed attempt by Halliburton to buy Baker Hughes. The UBS analysts note that the merger brings what they term as “pure play value, synergies, digital opportunities, perhaps most importantly, earnings accretion.” Also note that the CEO Jeff Immelt recently bought another 50,000 shares of the company’s stock. GE investors are paid a very solid 3% dividend. The UBS price objective for the stock is $34, and the consensus price target is $32.21. Shares closed on Friday at $30.71. Intel This leader in semiconductors is working hard to scale away from dependence on personal computers. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) designs, manufactures and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide. The company’s platforms are used in various computing applications comprising notebooks, two-in-one systems, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, wireless and wired connectivity products, wearables, retail devices and manufacturing devices, as well as for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings, home use and other market segments. The company also provides communication and connectivity offerings, such as baseband processors, radio frequency transceivers and power management integrated circuits, and tablet, phone and Internet of Things solutions, which include multimode 4G LTE modems, Bluetooth technology and GPS receivers, software solutions and interoperability tests, as well as home gateway and set-top box components. Intel reported third-quarter growth in sales, but data center sales came in below expectations for the tech giant and clouded otherwise overall solid growth. A new partnership with Microsoft for virtual reality and a consistent shift away for reliance on chips for personal computers keep the stock a compelling buy. A stunning 82.4% of Intel sales come from overseas, the lion’s share of it in Asia, where the chips that it produces are used in personal computers, tablets and other personal electronic devices. Intel investors receive a solid 3% dividend. UBS has a $40 price target, in line with the consensus target of $40.26. The shares ended Friday at $34.61.

News & Analysis Xilinx to Dive in Hyperscale Race Going after Intel/Altera and Nvidia Junko Yoshida 11/14/2016 10:00 AM EST Post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet TOKYO — Xilinx is jumping into the increasingly hot race for hyperscale data centers. The FPGA company is pursuing Altera (now a part of Intel), who took an early lead in the growing market by getting designed into Microsoft’s Project Catapult, the technology behind Microsoft’s hyperscale acceleration fabric. Xilinx also plans to go after the inference side of machine learning, an area in which the company is confident in beating Nvidia, as the GPU company is more focused on the training side of machine learning. At the SC16 in Salt Lake City this week, Xilinx is rolling out a new suite of technology designed to enable the world’s largest cloud service providers to rapidly develop and deploy acceleration platforms. The move reflects Xilinx’ commitment to capitalize on a recent big design win scored with Chinese Web giant Baidu. Baidu designed a software-defined accelerator based on an eight-lane PCIe 3.0 card using a 20nm Xilinx KU115 FPGA and 8-32 Gbytes memory. Baidu’s system parses SQL constructs into five types, enabling hardware processing elements in the FPGA to speed up from 8-55x depending on the application. This was discussed at the Hot Chips even last August. Andy Walsh, director of strategic market development for cloud computing at Xilinx, told EE Times that in addition to the Baidu design win, “two other hyperscale companies are testing Xilinx’ FPGA” for its integration into their accelerators. Hyperscale computing is in high demand. Companies such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Baidu are seeking a new data center architecture that can scale appropriately as systems face increased demand. Walsh joined Xilinx last year after spending twelve years at Nvidia. He stressed that the very nature of cloud data centers has dramatically changed over the last several years when compared with the days when banks and insurance companies bought up data servers based on Intel CPUs. Hyperscale companies are looking for flexible and scalable solutions for accelerators. They want “reconfigurable acceleration stack that can handle everything from machine learning, transcoding to data analytics, networking and storage,” he explained. In response, Xilinx is launching its FPGA-powered Xilinx Reconfigurable Acceleration Stack, which includes libraries, framework integrations, developer boards, and OpenStack support. The race for getting reconfigurable (Source: Xilinx) Noting that Xilinx enables silicon optimization for the broadest set of performance-demanding workloads, Walsh said, “These workload optimizations can be done in milliseconds by swapping in the most optimal design bitstream.” Compared with x86 server CPUs, Xilinx’s FPGAs can provide “the fastest path to realize 40x better compute efficiency,” the company claimed. Xilinx also boasted that the company can offer “up to six times the compute efficiency over competitive FPGAs.” Next page: Machine learning Email This Print Comment Page 1 / 3 Next > More Related Links Cosmopolitan Collaboration Companies Fully-Programmable SoCs -- New Breed of Devices Dual-Port 2A USB Chargers Only $1.95 Next-Gen Programmable, Cognitive Military Radio Systems Who Wouldn't Want a Big Hex Computer?

Where is the enemy? What does it consist of? Where is my own army in relation? This was a very literal limitation prior to aircraft, and, later, satellite surveillance. Intelligence came slow, if at all. The other side was however much of it you could see firsthand scaled by some best guesses. In this fog, tens of thousands of soldiers could be lost in a single all-but-blind WWI battlefield offensive. A trio of computer scientists at the US Army Research Laboratory see the fog of war as a useful metaphor for a powerful new form of data security, which they describe in the current issue of Computer as "cyberfog." They imagine data hacked apart and embedded in a fog network where it's fragmented into tiny pieces and distributed across not just servers, but end-user devices like the one you're currently reading this story on. Even if data like this is partially compromised, the information whole would remain opaque to the adversary and remain useful to us. Read more: The Cloud Is Much, Much Older Than You Think This is the argument, anyway. Fog computing or fog networking is not in itself a completely new idea. It became an official thing last year with the formation of the OpenFog Consortium, with membership including ARM, Cisco, Dell , Intel, Microsoft, and Princeton University. Fog computing is an architectural pattern meant to enable the devices making up the Internet of Things. It's kind of a way of having your cloud cake and eating it too for industrial real-time systems that depend on having data ready at shorter timescales than can be provided by distant data centers, but that would still benefit from the fragmentation and distribution of stored data. The fog fix, the essence of a fog network, is that this fragmented data is at least in part maintained within a network that's local to end-user devices (whether it's an industrial control system or an iPad) rather than centralized cloud locations (a data center on the other side of the country, perhaps). This is enabled by things like ad hoc peer-to-peer networks, mesh networks, and self-healing networks. Image: Charles Byers The idea behind fog storage is similar to that of distributed storage, generally. Here, units of information are broken apart into what are known as shards, which are usually imagined to be rows broken out from database tables and moved into other databases. So, we can imagine a single database containing not entire data tables by thin slices of many different tables all stashed together. Moving from the cloud to the fog is then a matter of moving those shards onto devices within a local network. How can that enhance security? Well, here we need to return to the original metaphor. An adversary looking to hack our network sees these bundles of shards littered across a number of devices, but each individual shard yields little value because it's been stripped of its context (the original table). A battlefield commander may gain some intelligence about the movement of a single enemy unit, but within the fog of war, they will have difficulty in determining what that means. It is likewise intelligence without context, which may be little better than noise. So, fogging increases uncertainty from the perspective of an adversary. This is further compounded in the cyberfog approach through intentional deception and obfuscation. "Obfuscation subjects information to multiple, equally possible interpretations, whereas deception aims to induce an incorrect interpretation that thwarts the adversary’s goals," the Army researchers write. "Obfuscation and deception can be achieved in many ways—for example, by providing a misleading view of the network’s topology, traffic, and behavior." The researchers caution, however, that none of this is particularly easy to implement: "Fogging/defogging must take into account the size, density, complexity, and tempo of the network, the mobility and geographic proximity of users and nodes where data shards are stored, how soon sharded information will become stale, how soon stored information might be needed, and so on." Handling all of this will likely require some deep and TBD computer science. Get six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day by signing up for our newsletter.

It's ready for the brave new world of USB-C connectivity. And the Touch Bar is cool right now, with potential to spare. [Photo: courtesy of Apple] Harry McCracken 11.14.16 8:00 AM There’s a famous story about an Apple meeting that occurred soon after Steve Jobs returned in 1997. As the company's cofounder rationalized its product line—which at the time included a dizzying array of Mac versions—he sketched a grid on a whiteboard. Then he filled its quadrants with four computers—one desktop and one portable model apiece for consumers and for professionals. Though the grid showed that Apple would pare its offerings way down, it also acknowledged a basic reality: You can’t please everybody with one machine. Consumers have their preferences; professional users have theirs. Fast-forward to late 2016. At Apple’s October media event at its Cupertino campus, the company announced its newest MacBook Pro notebooks. The great-great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren of the computer that Jobs put in the professional/portable square of his grid, they're aimed at people who need serious computing muscle and advanced technologies and are willing to pay for them. The new MacBook in three versions: 13" without Touch Bar, 13" with Touch Bar, and the 15 incherPhoto: courtesy of Apple Making every potential customer happy in 2016 is no more of a cakewalk than it was a couple of decades ago. Some pro users—the sort whose work involves industrial-strength tasks such as advanced video editing—are disappointed with the direction of these new MacBook Pros. They say they’d prefer newer Intel processors than the ones Apple chose and higher maximum RAM capacity, and are wary of the Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports that the company has used to replace older, more familiar connectors. And as long as their laptop is powerful, they don’t particularly care if it’s thin and light or thick and heavy. Apple, however, does care about computers being thin and light. It's long achieved that goal in part by wringing out aging technologies before every last potential customer is willing to say goodbye to them, and doesn't obsess over most standard tech specs. It loves to fuss over basic aspects of the experience such as screen quality. And it wants to introduce features that help Macs stand out from the the Windows-PC competition, such as its unique new Touch Bar. Judged on those priorities, the new MacBook Pros are, in most respects, winners—assuming you can deal with their price tags. The line starts at $1,499 for the most basic 13" model, which lacks two major new features, the Touch Bar and Touch ID. For $1,799, you get a 13" version with Touch Bar, Touch ID, and slightly better processor, graphics, and Wi-Fi specs. The 15" model starts at $1,999. Prices max out at $3,499 for a fully tricked-out 15" unit. (I've been trying out both 13" variants and the 15" one, via review units supplied by Apple.) Thin Is (Always) In This being Apple, it’s no shocker that when you unbox a new MacBook Pro, the most instantly obvious thing is that there’s less of it. At 3.02 lbs and .59" thick, the 13" models are .46 of a pound lighter and .12" thinner than their immediate predecessors. They’re also only a smidge heavier than the 13" MacBook Air, and thinner than the chunky end of that wedge-shaped notebook—a striking improvement from the era when the Air earned its name by being far more pleasant to tote than the Pro. Meanwhile, the 15" model, at 4.02 pounds and .61" thick is .47 of a pound lighter and a tenth of an inch thinner than the previous version. It's among the most portable full-power 15" notebooks out there, and maybe the first big-screen MacBook that truly makes sense for folks who like their laptops light. The MacBook Pro's backside Apple remains iconic but no longer glows.Photo: Harry McCracken If you own a MacBook Air, you should know that Apple ups its build-quality game with the Pro line. Their top halves are a single sweeping surface rather than a screen indented in a frame; there's no plasticky hump at the hinge; they're available in both silver and gray; in general, they just feel more solid and deluxe. (As they should at these prices.) As it did with last year's 12" MacBook, Apple made these new Macs thinner in part by equipping them with a keyboard designed not to eat up much vertical space. Slightly improved in this new iteration, it sports keys that are roomy, stable, nicely sculpted, and illuminated with perfectly even backlighting. What they don’t have is the clacky full-travel feel that some people covet. My fingers (which are used to Apple’s Smart Keyboard for the iPad Pro) adjusted quickly and found the results comfy. But if you’re a keyboard conservative, I recommend visiting an Apple Store and trying this one out before you commit. The 15" MacBook Pro's trackpad is bigger than a giant iPhone.Photo: Harry McCracken No such test drive is necessary for Apple's new trackpads: I can’t imagine anyone disliking them. As on the 12" MacBook and the the most recent previous round of MacBook Pros, they use Apple’s Force Touch technology, which means they're solid-state devices that uncannily mimic the feel of a click by vibrating. The fact that the trackpad doesn’t actually move up and down allowed Apple to make it larger; you can plop an iPhone 7 Plus down on the 15" model’s pad with space to spare. The extra real estate is a particular boon for maneuvers that call for precision, such as painting in Photoshop, as well as MacOS gestures that require you to splay your fingers out on the trackpad surface. Apple has done a sweeping, imaginative job of building Touch Bar functionality into MacOS. The trackpad may be bigger and better, but what sits above the keyboard on the $1,799 13" MacBook Pro and the 15" model is all-new. On the top-most, right-hand corner, where the power button has traditionally resided, there’s now a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, adopted from the iPhone and iPad. As on Apple’s mobile devices, it lets you unlock your Mac in a jiffy without a password and safely and swiftly pay at online stores that support Apple Pay. Coming soon: third-party apps with Touch ID support, such as a version of login manager 1Password. To the left of the Touch ID sensor, instead of the top row of function keys that have been part of computer keyboards since mainframe days, is the long, skinny, touch-enabled OLED display known as the Touch Bar. This is the first time Apple has made Macs you can control by tapping on a screen, and you might instinctively use the touchscreen PCs that are common in the Windows world as a reference point. In fact, I did that myself. But if you’re clamoring for Apple to put conventional touchscreens on Macs a la Microsoft's Surface—a move it's long said it has no interest in making—the Touch Bar will not mollify you even a tiny bit. Rather than being a halfway step to giving Macs a full touch interface, it’s an extension of the keyboard, designed to keep you productive without forcing you to lift your arm and jab at the main display. Apple underlined that point by giving the Touch Bar a predominantly black-and-white color scheme that matches that of the adjacent physical keys; even its surface feels much like the nearby keycaps. (As I used it, I tended to forget it was a screen at all.) The $1799 13" MacBook Pro (left) has Touch Bar and Touch ID; the $1499 model does not.Photo: Harry McCracken Conceptually, the Touch Bar offers two related benefits. With just a tap or two, it lets you access features that would ordinarily require you to swipe a mouse pointer around using the trackpad or a mouse. And because it can show features that are specific to the app and task you’re performing, it's able to expose functionality that would otherwise be buried deep in on-screen menus or toolbars. The Touch Bar's most straightforward substitute for the classic top row of keys is called Control Strip. It gives you virtual keys for tweaking the brightness and volume, managing windows, and performing other jobs that the old keys did. But the Control Strip, unlike the plastic keys it replaces, is customizable. Want a button to lock the screen or call up MacOS’s dictation feature? Fine—you can drag it onto the Touch Bar as a substitute for one of the default buttons. Control Strip lets you reconfigure the Touch Bar by dragging buttons right off the display.Photo: Harry McCracken Where the Touch Bar really gets interesting is when you’re using an app that’s been designed with it in mind. In that instance, the Control Strip collapses down on the right side of the Touch Bar, and the rest of the space is devoted to functions specific to the task at hand. If you’re entering text in an app such as Messages, for instance, you get an emoji picker as well as smartphone-style autocomplete suggestions for the word you’re typing. Touch Bar word and emoji suggestions Apple has done a sweeping, imaginative job of building Touch Bar functionality into MacOS and the apps that ship with it. In Photos, for instance, you can dig deeply into the features for fiddling with an image without removing your finger from the Touch Bar. In Safari, you can skim through teensy half-a-pinky-size thumbnails of your open tabs. In the Numbers spreadsheet, you can construct formulas and format cells. In Reminders, you can check off completed to-dos or give yourself more time to tackle them. And on and on. Some apps—but not all of them—let you customize their Touch Bar capabilities in the the same way you can rearrange the Control Strip. Editing a photo in Apple's Photos app via the Touch Bar This context sensitivity will not be limited to Apple’s own wares. At the MacBook Pro launch event, Adobe previewed an upcoming Touch Bar-aware version of Photoshop that could make it a lot simpler to make the most of that notoriously opaque program. By the end of the year, Apple says, a bunch of other popular MacOS apps will support the Touch Bar, including Microsoft Office, Skype, OmniFocus, Pixelmator, Coda, Sketch, and more. (If Chrome doesn’t join that list, it might force me to switch to Safari.) Hardcore touch typists will have to adjust their work habits. Assuming that third-party developers take the Touch Bar seriously—and Apple puts it on other machines, such as the iMac—it could become an indispensable part of the Mac interface. But it isn’t the sort of feature you encounter for the first time and immediately begin using as if you’d known it for eons. For me, it took a few days of use before I’d figured out all the major icons and was able to maneuver around on autopilot. (Apple provides some tips and tricks, but something closer to a full-blown interactive tutorial might have been in order.) Hardcore touch typists will also have to adjust their work habits: The Touch Bar requires you to at least peek at your keyboard as you work. This fact bothered me more in theory than in practice, perhaps because it's located close enough to the main display that I was able to glance downward when I needed it. The more useful you find the Touch Bar, the more likely it is that you’ll come up with ways it could be even better. At first, my right hand's ring finger had a tendency to brush against the Siri button and accidentally trigger it, so I removed Siri and replaced it with a section of blank space. But it turned out I could only do that in the full-width Control Strip, not the reduced-size one. I also found that the media-player feature sometimes didn't work or played back sound effects such as Slack's alert ping rather than anything I'd want to control. On the Touch Bar, your Safari tabs are really tiny Ultimately, not every Mac user is going to take to the Touch Bar. But I think that some skeptics will have second thoughts after they’ve gotten their fingers on it for a while. And I’m looking forward to seeing where Apple takes this concept with Touch Bar 2.0, 3.0, and beyond. Port Overhaul When Apple takes bulk out of a laptop, it often does so in part by retiring components that it thinks are headed for the parts graveyard anyway, such as DVD burners and Ethernet jacks. In the case of the new MacBook Pros, this streamlining comes mostly in the form of providing Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports to replace a disparate collection of connectors. The previous MacBook Pros had a MagSafe power connector, two USB ports, two Thunderbolt 2 ones, an HDMI jack for TV hookups, a headphone jack, and an SD memory-card slot. The new $1,799 13" model and the 15" one boil this down to the headphone jack—insert your own iPhone 7 reference here—and four Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ones. Two Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports and a good old headphone jack.Photo: Harry McCracken I say "Thunderbolt 3/USB-C" because while the two technologies use the same slim, reversible connector, they aren’t actually the same thing. Between them, the vision is to let you plug into AC adapters, displays, storage devices, and more, all using one do-everything port. Fast Company contributor Glenn Fleishman does a good job of sorting out the details, which are manifold, in this article. When Apple introduced USB-C last year on the 12" MacBook, it went overboard with minimalistic zeal and equipped the machine with one port, which meant you couldn’t even plug in your laptop and charge your phone at the same time without the use of an external adapter. The four ports you get on the higher-end 13" MacBook Pro and the 15" model should be enough for almost anybody. The $1,499 MacBook Pro has only two ports, located on the left side, which is (barely) adequate—but I wish Apple had put one on each side of the case, which would let you more conveniently charge your Mac regardless of whether you're sitting to the left or right of a power plug. Apple didn’t go whole-hog for Thunderbolt 3/USB-C without reason. Even with a MacBook Pro with plentiful ports, the issue remains that Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C are not yet anything like commonplace. Devices such as desktop monitors, hard disks, and thumb drives that are built for them are still greatly outnumbered by ones designed for earlier standards. For now, if you buy one of these MacBook Pros and bide your time until the new standards are widely supported, you'll have to invest in the necessary cables and adapters—available from Apple at temporarily discounted prices as well as from other makers—to make your new Mac work with old stuff. Or in some cases you might just go wireless: For instance, Apple says that it ditched the SD slot in part because so many new cameras ship with built-in Wi-Fi. Now, Apple didn’t go whole-hog for Thunderbolt 3/USB-C without reason. The company has always been willing to usher customers into a period of disruptive transition in order to help propagate new standards. (Exhibit A: The iPhone’s Lightning plug, which replaced the once-pervasive Dock connector and had some folks squawking for a spell.) This is a strikingly different philosophy than that practiced by many makers of Windows PCs—companies such as Dell will still sell you a laptop with an elephantine, 1980s-era VGA port if that is what you want. As in previous instances, the fact that Apple has embraced these new technologies with such gusto should help nudge the rest of the industry to do the same that much quicker. But that doesn’t mean that you, Mac user, must feel obligated to make the move before you're ready. If the prospect sounds daunting, there's no shame in holding off on getting a new MacBook Pro—and the longer you wait, the more appealing the Thunderbolt 3/USB-C proposition will get. New power adapter: no MagSafe, no cord-wrapping wings.Photo: Harry McCracken Oh, one other thing: As became obvious last year when Apple released the 12" MacBook, the arrival of USB-C as the new means of charging Macs means the end of MagSafe, the beloved, ingenious technology that prevented a power cord that got accidentally jostled from dragging the entire computer with it onto the floor. It's sad to see it go. But personally, I miss the fold-out wings on the old-style MacBook’s power brick—which let you neatly wrap up the cord for travel—more than MagSafe. The new brick, which looks like a giant iPhone charger, lacks them. Apple Polishing Beyond the svelter design, Touch Bar, and new ports, the new MacBook Pros shows multiple refinements that, on their own, wouldn't prompt anyone to splurge on a new computer. They just make that new computer better once you have it, and are the sort of improvements that Apple never gets enough credit for making. The MacBook Pro's high-resolution Retina display would have been one of the biggest reasons to upgrade from a MacBook Air no matter what. But it's also brighter than previous screens—at full blast, it makes my eyeballs tingle—offers better contrast, and has a wider color gamut for more accurate reproduction of photos. Apple also lavished attention on the speakers, which you can crank way, way up without turning music or movie soundtracks into a distorted mess. The ones on the 15" model, amazingly, sound better to my ears than the audio system built into my aging 42" HDTV. Given that some of Apple's most demanding professional users are fretting about these machines' processors and RAM capacities, should those of us who don't need tippy-top-of-the-line performance be concerned? I'll leave benchmarking to experts such as the folks at AnandTech, but these Macs have more than enough horsepower for non-superhuman computing tasks; even though Apple didn't use Intel's latest processors, it called on technologies such as high-speed solid-state storage to keep things fast. The three units I tried were the base-model versions at each price point—$1,499, $1,799, and $1,999—and none of them ever felt slow. Photo: courtesy of Apple I also didn't try to formally measure battery life, which Apple rates at up to 10 hours. The company has clearly decided that this figure—basically, one especially busy workday—is ideal for most computing devices, which is why it's what it strives to attain on all versions of the iPad as well as these new laptops. Ultimately, the design decisions that Apple made with these new-generation MacBook Pros result in machines that I think will please many people. What they don't do is clarify the future of the Mac for every type of buyer. Besides those power users who were hoping for even more potent MacBook Pros—and may get them in updates to these models—there's the far larger audience of people who don't need boundless computing muscle and are at least somewhat price-conscious. At the same time that Apple announced the new Pros, it discontinued sales of the $899 11" MacBook Air—a candidate for my own personal pantheon of the greatest computers ever—except to educational institutions. The 13" Air remains in the lineup for now as a $999 budget model, but with its non-Retina screen, it's a bit of a throwback. The 12" MacBook is $1,299, and aimed at people who crave portability above all else. That makes the non-Touch Bar version of the 13" MacBook Pro the cheapest up-to-date, general-purpose Mac notebook. Its starting price of $1,499 is $200 more than the previous-generation 13" Pro. You don't need to be an incurable cheapskate to hope that Apple fills in the hole that creates in its lineup, either by cutting the entry-level cost for a MacBook Pro or releasing something new and versatile that isn't a Pro and costs at least a couple of hundred dollars less. Such a MacBook would be the modern-day descendant of the one that Steve Jobs put in the consumer/portable quadrant of his 1997 grid.

Chinese newspaper the Global Times, which has been accused of having a pro-government stance, has set out a short and sharp warning to Trump and other supporters of 45% tariffs imposed on Chinese goods and services entering the US; screw China and China will screw you harder. “China will take a tit-for-tat approach then. A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US.” In short, tariff us and we will be tariffing you back hard and fast. The protectionist policy employed by Trump throughout the election campaign would appear to be more than a political soundbite to attract interest from citizens consumed by national pride or those who have found themselves unprepared for globalization and the emergence of the digital economy. Speaking during an interview with Bloomberg, Judy Shelton, economic advisor to President Elect Trump, indicated the policy would be taken forward: “He is someone going to carry through on what he says. He’s always very straight-forward and honest. I expect him to be consistent.” Let’s assume the Chinese market isn’t crucial for the growth of American businesses for the moment, Trump is not necessarily stopping with the Chinese, they have just felt the sharpest end of the stick. A 35% tariff has been proposed for other nations also. Like the Chinese, Korea, India, Japan, the EU, the UK, etc. are unlikely to take these tariffs lying down should the situation arise. Trump must have immense confidence in the strength of the US domestic market if it is to replace trade potential lost to these nations through tariffs. Risk to technology industry One of the biggest risks will be for the technology industry, not so much on the consumer side of things however. Sure, iPhone sales may suffer for a lack of international opportunity, however tariffs placed on foreign businesses could create a gap in the market for new US brands to enter the fold. Just because wallets are being squeezed a bit at the moment doesn’t mean the millennials are going to go that long without replacing their smartphones. The risk here will be undertaken by companies like Dell Technologies, VMWare, Intel, IBM etc. who are only looking internationally for growth. The US market is stagnant; new projects and customers are coming from the likes of China, India, South America and Eastern Europe, the very countries Trump is sizing up for a trade war. The US has a lot more to lose than the rest of the world. In a list of the top 20 US exporters for 2015, Apple, Qualcomm, Intel and Cisco Systems represent the technology world; only Oil & Gas has a higher number of representatives. Electronic equipment also represented $163.1 billion of outgoing international trade, an increase of 36.9% since 2011, and 11.3% of the total export of US industry last year. Risk to the Rest of the World Aside from the obvious risk to the US economy, China Topix points out there could be a significant risk to numerous other nations, as well as the possibility of a worldwide recession should a trade war escalate. A slowdown in China could see the country spending less internationally. The immediate ripples would be felt in countries like South Korea, Japan, and Brazil, where China is the biggest market for exports. Ripples would be felt further and it would only be a matter of time before they hit the US again. Trump could reverse years of progress achieved through free-trade and set into motion a downward spiral. It’s very doom and gloom, but a realistic possibility. “For many countries around the world, China is now the biggest trading partner, so this kind of tit-for-tat trade protectionism with China will dampen the atmosphere for the international trading community,” said Yorizumi Watanabe, Economics Professor at Japan’s Keio University. An escalating trade war is certainly a long-way off however it is becoming a distinct possibility. Before Trump angers the rest of the world, he and his administration would have to negotiate around other politicians, as well as an army of lobbyists who are unlikely to be thrilled by such an idea as pissing off the Chinese. All-in-all, protectionism is a simple policy to attract interest from some of the more short-sighted demographics in the electorate. If the US policy continues down this route it’s unlikely to be good news for anyone. Despite it being a long way off and there being significant hurdles in the way, if there was one person who is determined enough to do it, America has found him.

This completely misses the psyche of those voting Trump. They are the ones who have seen jobs exported abroad to cheap, unregulated countries in the Global corporations pursuit of ever increasing profits. These are the people who’s wealth has been stolen by the Financial industry and those at the top of the corporation ladder, paying themselves ever greater salaries for “performance” figures that are just about how many American workers they have fired. This is a disgraceful attemot to paint those frustrated and disenchanted men and women as some form of ill prepared or digitally illiterate class. Those working in the lower echelons of the various tech savvy companies do not fare that well with salaries in America but at least they have jobs. Your view that somehow this band of Technically literate millenials are embracing a successful future is rubbish. As with those in the many industries that have grown and then fallen, once their labour costs get too much, the corporations will simply offshore them using free trade agreements dreamt up by lobbyists working for corporate heads. Jamie Davies 14/11/2016 @ 2:21 pm Reply Hi Peter Western societies have shifted towards a service-driven economy with the majority of schools and training programmes built around working the same service-driven economy, so it should come as little surprise manufacturing jobs are being outsourced to countries where these skills are much cheaper. You have a valid point and there are disenfranchised populations in Western societies, however the point of the article is that protectionism will not lead to any positive outcomes for anyone involved. It sounds like you are pro-protectionism/anti-globalisation – do you think the corporations should be banned from outsourcing labour to cheaper international markets? The downside would be a more expensive product which would mean the organization is less competitive globally, ultimately limiting the potential of the organization in the long-run. Would be good to hear you thoughts Thanks Jamie Kenneth Hoyt 15/11/2016 @ 2:55 am Reply Excuse me, you are jumping the gun by 170 days. Trump is more than 2 months from inauguration. Then come his first 100 days. There is so much that will occur before he meets Mr Xi somewhere in the world. Please take a deep breath. Stop recycling the same old anti/Trump speculation. Start by watching for the coming surpises. Elections do have consequences as Barrack once reminded us all.

Virtually every aspect of the Eve V, from its basic shape to its components and features were developed based on input from the community that company fostered at eve.community. Now, the very Surface Pro 4-like machine is getting close to its official release on Indiegogo and the company posted the final hardware specifications on their site Thursday. As you can see from the information below, Eve’s community has obviously pushed for and is receiving, some industry-leading parts. CPU: Intel 7th Gen Core M3/i5/i7 RAM: 8GB/16GB LPDDR3 Storage: 128/256/512GB SSD Connectivity: 801.11ac Wi-Fi with 2×2 MU-MIMO, Bluetooth 4.2, Wireless Display Wi-Fi Ports: 1 x Thunderbolt 3 USB Type-C, 1 x USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-C, 2 x USB 3.1 Gen 1 USB-A, 1 x 3.5mm audio, 1 x MicroSDXC reader Display: 12.3-inch IGZO LCD, 2736X1824 resolution, 1:1400 contrast ratio, 450 nits brightness Touch Panel: Gorilla Glass with Anti-Fingerprint and Anti-Reflection coating, Metal Mesh technology Battery: 48Wh Sensors: Fingerprint, Hall, Gravity, Light, Gyroscope, GPS Audio: Quad speaker at 1W each, dedicated headphone jack audio amplifier by TI, 2 noise-canceling microphones Cameras: 2MP front, 5MP rear Stylus: N-trig, Surface compatible, 1024 pressure levels, two buttons Keyboard: Pogo-Pin and Wireless keyboard with backlight, latest glass ClickPad by Synaptics, Bluetooth 4.2 support for up to three devices, 15 hours of battery life OS: Windows 10 More: Eve’s crowdsourced Eve V Windows 10 2-in-1 will be very Surface Pro-like That is just about a dream team of components and would likely meet most items on a Surface Pro 4 owner’s wishlist for a Surface Pro 5. The battery exceeds Microsoft’s version by a full 10 watts, the display should at least compete with the Surface Pro 4’s excellent screen and its connectivity options are far superior. Even audio support is enhanced, with four speakers and an amplifier for the audio jack. Given that the Eve V is expected to start out at a competitive $900 base price, and given its up-to-date components like Intel’s Kaby Lake CPU, the only questions remaining for someone looking for a new Windows 10 2-in-1 in the tablet-first configuration are: will Eve be able to produce the machine at volume with the expected quality and reliability. And, can a small company like this provide adequate support? According to a recent Ask Me Anything session, the Eve team is convinced that they will be able to produce the Eve V to meet the expected demand and will be able to support it as required. If they can, then a buyer would be remiss in failing to at least consider the machine. Also watch: HP Spectre Review Please enable Javascript to watch this video

Why Japan needs no more venture capital… Dr. Tomy Kamada, CEO and Founder of TomyK Ltd. The yearly total investment available to startups in Japan, about $2bn, is dwarfed by the US’s $60bn. Yet, Tokyo based angel investor Dr. Tomy Kamada thinks Japan has enough venture capital. What many people do not understand is that ordinary VCs, now joined by a growing number of corporate venture capitalists (CVCs) seeking to leverage synergies with innovative firms, focus on financing middle stage startups. However, the problems rest at the early and later stages, says Kamada. VCs rarely invest in early stage startups, leaving the task of high risk investing to a handful of wealthy individuals. “There is almost no seed capital in Japan,” says Kamada. Perhaps $150m is available, compared with $20bn in the US. Startups can exit in one of two ways. One is by acquisition to a larger company through merger and acquisition (M&A). The second is by an initial public offering (IPO). Few Japanese startups are acquired, so the startup ecosystem depends heavily on the ability of firms to IPO. But, Japan’s small company IPO market got off to a late start. Tokyo Stock Exchange Mothers came into being in 1999, a full 28 years after the US’s NASDAQ (1971). During that period Apple, Intel, Microsoft and many other successful US startups went public. Exiting founders reinvested a portion of their windfall gains back into new startups. This cycle has repeated itself three or four times over, establishing Silicon Valley’s baseline investment culture. Japan is two or three cycles behind the curve, says Kamada. He offers his own entrepreneurial experience as example: Kamada founded a startup software company in Japan in 1984 that listed on TSE-Mothers in 2001. He ran the company for 10 years after its IPO, before leaving to angel invest through TomyK Ltd, the startup ‘booster’ he founded in 2012. “I’m from the first generation cycle of experienced investors,” says Kamada, adding, “It’s still a small community.” Preparing for IPO is a lengthy process. It can take 7 to 10 years for a startup to overcome regulatory hurdles. The typical VC fund operates for only 5 years, after which invested capital must be returned to investors. Given their limited time horizon, ordinary VCs avoid investing at the early stage. Instead, they prefer to invest 3 to 4 years before an IPO. “This limits the effectiveness of the startup ecosystem,” believes Kamada. In time, 2nd and 3rd generation investors will add girth to Japan’s startup ecosystem. The same would be true if big companies acquired more Japanese startups. What’s blocking them? It is not for lack of money. Japanese firms sit on a mountain of over $3tn in cash. One reason is that big, traditional Japanese companies develop new technologies in-house. They have the research facilities and people to do so. Research departments are staffed by clever university graduates working under lifetime employment. That model worked well for many years. Today, “Big Japanese firms still try to develop technology by themselves in secret,” says Kamada. Yet the speed of innovation now outpaces the capacity of any single firm to keep up with the changes. No company, regardless of size, can innovate sufficiently or fast enough. That’s why Facebook and Google aggressively buy innovative startups. Such ‘open innovation’ allows cashed-out startup founders to reinvest windfall profits as business angels and venture capitalists, supporting the next round of innovative startups. Kamada is hopeful Japan’s big companies will begin gobbling up innovative startups, finally embracing the ‘open innovation’ economy. It’s important they do. “If they don’t, they won’t survive,” he says, optimistically adding, “Once a symbolic company, like Sony, starts acquiring startups, others will likely follow.” Recent articles: October 23, 2016: BOJ yields to negative interest rates October 2, 2016: Why Japan lacks a Donald Trump September 11, 2016: University Challenge — Can Todai ‘make hay’ with Japan Inc?

Bigelow November 14th, 2016 @bvbigelow @xconomy Like Us ◄ Raken Raken has developed Web-based daily reporting software that enables contractors, architects, and others to coordinate tasks and share information. Founder Kyle Slager says Raken's mobile app replaces PC-based software, and enables users to work more efficiently by using their smartphones to share project photos, task lists, weather forecasts, and safety concerns; and to document job site accidents, among other things. The startup has over 2,000 customers in nine countries. Founded in 2012, Raken has 18 employees and has raised $3.5 million from Rincon Venture Partners, Eniac Ventures, Spider Capital, and angel investors. (Image of San Francisco's Transbay Transit Center project courtesy of Raken) Soci Soci has created a Web-based platform for managing social media. As businesses moved beyond a single corporate social media page, Soci founders Afif Khoury and Alo Sarv saw the need for software that would serve as a “central command,” enabling business customers to deploy their social media marketing strategies, customize their brand messaging, and control their customer conversations across thousands of social media pages. Founded in 2012, Soci spent 2014 in the EvoNexus incubator and raised $4.25 million from local angel investors and Silicon Valley Growth Syndicate, GrowthX, and Axon Ventures. Soci said it has grown its revenue by over 300 percent in its second year of commercialization, and now has 35 employees. (Soci photo) AttackIQ AttackIQ has developed software, called “FireDrill,” to help companies and other enterprise customers answer the question, “How well are your network security tools, products, and processes working?” According to AttackIQ, conventional security testing is fragmented and inconsistent, as the average enterprise network combines as many as 75 different cybersecurity programs. FireDrill systematically probes security controls and quantifies a network's defensive readiness, resiliency, and weaknesses. CEO Stephan Chenette and chief software architect Rajesh Sharma founded AttackIQ in late 2013. They have raised $7.8 million from Index Ventures and other investors, and have 15 employees. (AttackIQ image) Approved Former Redfin developers Andy Taylor and Navtej Sadhal founded Approved last year in San Francisco. They are creating Web-based software to help home mortgage lenders streamline their loan application, document collection, and approval process from a few weeks to a few minutes. The two founders are now working in the EvoNexus incubator in downtown San Diego, with undisclosed funding from angels and “a prominent Palo Alto VC firm.” Taylor oversaw Redfin’s products team, and Sadhal ran the platform team that kept the Redfin site operating with 12 million unique monthly visitors. “We know how to build world-class software,” Taylor said. (Approved image) CureMetrix CureMetrix, founded in 2014 by CEO Kevin Harris and CTO Homa Karimabadi, is applying artificial intelligence algorithms to medical imaging and diagnostics. Above, three mammogram images shows the progression of a malignant breast tumor over time. The CureMetrix algorithm generates a “Q number” for each image. Anything over 30 is suspicious. As Harris put it, “We are developing a platform that provides more information to radiologists than they can see with their eyes.” With unspecified funding from San Diego’s Analytics Ventures, CureMetrix now has 11 employees. (Mammogram images courtesy of CureMetrix) Clarify Medical Martyn Gross founded Clarify Medical in 2014 to move the standard of care treatment for psoriasis and eczema (ultraviolet-B light therapy) from the clinic into the home. The company has developed a handheld LED light that is linked through a wireless connection to Clarify’s Web-based services. Gross says it is quicker and more convenient for patients, while still providing medical oversight and personalized care for patients with immune-related skin conditions. Clarify has raised $3.1 million from angel investors, and recently added serial entrepreneur Jim Sweeney as CEO. (Gross is now vice president of innovation). Another prominent figure, life sciences investor David Hale, is board chairman.

Graphene consists of a single, tightly packed layer of carbon atoms (one-millionth the thickness of paper). Due to its high electrical conductivity, extraordinary tensile strength, flexibility, transparency, and extreme light weight, graphene is under widespread investigation as a new "wonder material" for making integrated circuits, sensors, biomedical membranes and devices, photovoltaic cells, flexible displays, desalination membranes, and other applications. Zaretski founded Grolltex in 2015 with angel investor and CEO Jeff Draa. They raised $1 million in seed funding in April. (GrollTex photo) Ossic Frustrated by the gap between what is possible and what was available in audio technology, Ossic founders Jason Riggs, Joy Lyons, Jose Arjol Acebal, and David Carr set out in 2014 to develop headphones that provide immersive, three-dimensional sound. Using software and sensors, they developed the Ossic X headphones for interactive media, including gaming, virtual reality, and augmented reality applications. The founders initially self-funded Ossic, and raised an unspecified amount in seed funding last year from angel investors. Earlier this year, Ossic raised over $2.7 million from 10,263 backers on Kickstarter. The company now has 16 employees. While Ossic faces stiff competition from companies like San Francisco-based Dysonics (backed by Intel Capital), Ossics recently won the top CES 2017 "best of innovation" award in headphones. Ossic spent time in San Diego’s EvoNexus incubator and London’s Abbey Road Red music technology incubator. (Ossic photo) Koriist Koriist is developing software that enables sensors, devices, and networks based on incompatible communications technologies to securely deliver data to the cloud, enabling information sharing. Koriist says its technology unlocks access to the existing Internet of Things, including devices running on legacy protocols such as RS-232 Serial, Modbus, BACnet, LonWorks, and Profibus. Koriist says providing its software as a service would enable customers to avoid the cost of replacing legacy equipment with IP-based systems, and gain additional cost savings from improved operational efficiencies. Koriist also plans to provide analytics that would enable its customers to further improve their resource management. Founders Chad Trytten and Ron Wangerin started Koriist in April, with undisclosed seed funding from angel investors. (Koriist photo of CEO Chad Trytten (right) and team member Jake Freeman) Trials.ai Founders Kim and Tom Walpole started Trials.ai in 2014 (initially as Catalyst eClinical) to create a cloud-based platform that could be used by contract research organizations, medical device companies, and participating scientists to manage clinical trials for medical devices. According to Trials.ai, half of such studies currently use paper to administer trials and collect data, but the FDA has mandated that such data must be submitted electronically by next September. Trials.ai has been developing software modules that can be adopted to manage many different types of device trials, and has recruited prominent business and device industry leaders as advisors. Trials.ai has been self-funded so far, and is generating some revenues from customers. But the Walpoles are now seeking seed funding. (Trials.ai image) Lymber Lymber is an online marketplace that enables app users to book openings in fitness and wellness classes. At the same time, Lymber provides gyms, spas, yoga studios, and other businesses a Web-based platform to maximize their revenues by using dynamic pricing to fill spots based on real-time demand. There are no Lymber membership fees for consumers, so users can go when and where they want, at a price they are willing to pay. Doug Hecht and Chuck Phillips (who co-founded the San Diego digital ad network Digitaria) founded Lymber seven months ago, with $1 million in seed funding raised from local angel investors. There are now 10 employees. (Lymber photo) CureMatch Founded in 2015 based on technology developed at UC San Diego, CureMatch is developing computational software to help oncologists choose optimal cancer drug combinations by matching treatment regimens with each patient’s DNA and abnormal proteins. The system was developed by Razelle Kurzrock, deputy director of the UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center, and Igor Tsigelny, a UC San Diego research professor and expert in bioinformatics, structural biology, and molecular modeling. San Diego-based Analytics Ventures and angel investors provided undisclosed initial funding. CureMatch has five employees and collaborative agreements with the Moores Cancer Center and doctors at Scripps Green Hospital and the United Arab Emirates' United Health Authority.

The results were so encouraging, we’re doing it again. The idea was to feature early stage companies in the region that have not attracted much attention or raised a substantial amount of startup capital. Such lists can be entirely relative, but I sought to adjust for the capricious effects of subjectivity. I started with a list of companies already screened by the San Diego Venture Group’s annual venture summit, and consulted with investors and startup mentors to refine the list. Within the realm of “most-promising,” these are companies with the elements that tech investors and mentors look for—innovative technology, an outstanding team, and/or an impressive business plan. Our list was far from definitive, but some noteworthy outcomes from last year’s selection suggest we’re taking the right approach: —Cypher Genomics, founded in 2011 with software to rapidly identify the genetic variations amid billions of gigabases of genome sequencing data, sold last November to San Diego’s Human Longevity. Financial terms were not disclosed. —Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) paid over $400 million in August to acquire Nervana Systems, the two-year-old San Diego startup offering its machine learning technology as a cloud-based service. —Colorado-based Webroot said in September it had acquired CyberFlow Analytics, the 2013 startup developing analytic software and machine learning technology to monitor the data flowing in and out of networks for anything that looks out of the ordinary. (Webroot withheld terms of the deal.) Other companies also demonstrated why they made our 2016 list of companies to watch: Classy recently raised $30 million for software-as-a-service that helps nonprofits run crowdfunding campaigns and raise donations online; Seismic raised $40 million in May to advance its software for updated corporate sales and marketing material; GovX, with revenue up nearly 40 percent over last year, raised $3.8 million in a Series D round of investment capital, according to founder and chairman Tony Farwell. The startups selected for this year’s list began, as it did last year, with a master list of companies screened by the San Diego Venture Group for its annual venture summit. I am grateful to Mike Krenn, the venture group’s president, for his help on this project. I widened my net this year. Longtime tech entrepreneur and angel investor Marco Thompson, who is closely associated with San Diego’s EvoNexus incubator, contributed a number of companies to the list. Tim Rueth, a UC San Diego entrepreneur in residence and member of the EvoNexus selection committee, also screened the list, and offered his perspective. I met with Seed San Diego partners Taner Halicioglu and Eric Gasser, who also reviewed the companies and provided their feedback. With the benefit of all their insights, I winnowed the list to 12. Generally speaking, the companies selected this time are at an earlier stage than last year’s list. Four of the companies here were founded in 2014, another three were started in 2015, and two—CureMatch and Lymber—debuted earlier this year. Most of the companies on this year’s list also have resided or are currently enrolled in EvoNexus, the incubator supported by San Diego tech companies that offers free office space to startups with no strings attached. Four of the companies on this year’s list also reflect how San Diego’s tech and life sciences communities have been coming together in interesting ways. CureMatch is using analytic software to help doctors optimize cancer treatments; CureMetrix is applying artificial intelligence to medical imaging and diagnostics; Trials.ai is providing back-office support for clinicial trials; and Clarify Medical has developed technology that simplifies the current treatment for psoriasis and eczema. Much of the innovation in San Diego is taking place along this interface between technology and life sciences, a trend that is likely to continue. Bruce V. Bigelow is the editor of Xconomy San Diego.

I mean, nobody see it coming, and that’s great from a “breaking news” perspective. So, let’s sum things up in case you’ve missed it: the Meizu M5 featured a 5.2 inches wide display, a 2.5D variety sporting HD 720p resolution and being an entry level/low end kind of a deal, was powered by a MediaTek MT6750 system on chip. According to today’s intel, it definitely seems that we’re going to get a premium version of this baby, the Meizu M5 Note respectively. The device was put to test through Geekbench and bench-marked thoroughly, offering us, news-obsessed chickens an idea about what’s going on, something like a limited look with regard to the smartphone’s hardware specifications. To begin with, the Meizu M5 Note runs on a better chip-set, the MediatTek MT6755  Helio P10 respectively, which is an order of magnitude better when compared to the one found in the M5. This baby features an octa-core architecture (8 cores) with the CPUs clocked at 1.0 GHz (they can do better) working together with 3 gigabytes of RAM, which is 50% more than in the M5. The Meizu M5 Note scored 687/2481 in the Geekbench test for single core/dual core performance. The smartphone also passed through China’s CCC, receiving its official certification, with the model number M682 listed on the manifest. Considering that the current M3 Note has the M681 model number, it seems quite obvious that the M682 stands for the M5 Note, that’s basically a no-brainer. The CCC safety mark from the Chinese regulatory agency is mandatory for all devices sold, imported or used in mainland China. Unfortunately, there’s no word about the M5 Note’s price nor availability for now, but stay tuned for more news. source: Geekbench via MySmartPrice Tags M682meizuMeizu M5 Note Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Add to Google+ Add to Pinterest Post navigation Previous article Previous post: UMi-BTS3 Bluetooth Speaker Review Next article Next post: OnePlus 4 Rumored Again With Dual Cameras, 8 GB of RAM and More Live Comment Your email address will not be published.

But those keen to declare Intel's high-end reign is coming to an end should not get too excited: the tender may mention Power as a possibility, but also requires hardware compatibility with Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2016. IBM once offered a tool called PowerVM Lx86 applications that translated x86 code on the fly, but Big Blue binned it back in 2013. This tender therefore looks like it is nodding to competition, not contemplating it seriously. The new machine is a replacement for CSIRO's Bragg Accelerator Cluster, which was commissioned in 2009 and scored 156th place in the Top500.org list in June 2012, when it had 6,786 cores split among Xeon E5-2650 CPUs and NVIDIA Tesla 2050 GPUs. That rig was capable of boosting the super to 210.7 teraflops. This time around CSIRO wants a petaflop-class machine but doesn't mind how it gets there: the tender calls for each compute node to “include at least two host processors with either a Power or Intel x86 64 bit architecture” but doesn't specify how many nodes are required. Firm requirement include SUSE Enterprise Server 12.1 or later, at least 128GB of RAM and 500GB of local storage per compute and the presence of (unspecified) GPUs. Another requirement of interest ist that the new machine “shall be able to support existing science code that runs on an x86 architecture.” The tender then says “If porting to another architecture is required associated costs should be provided,” which sounds like a wink to IBM as Big Blue recently updated its guidance on Porting from Intel x86 to Power systems running Linux. But again, The Register feels safe in suggesting the possibility of porting is raised as a nod to competition, because the tender is for just AU$4m (£2.3m US$3m), which doesn't buy a lot of compute nodes. The tender also specifies that Bragg's existing InfiniBand network will be retained, as will the five racks Bragg currently occupies. Hanging on to racks hardly suggests a willingness to spend up big on code translation to make a move to Power, even if the architecture could meet the requirement of running WIndows Server. The tender closes on December 19 and CSIRO says new machine “is expected to be up and running during the first half of 2017.” The new “Advanced Accelerator Compute Cluster” will be tasked with “data analysis, modelling, and simulation in a variety of science domains, such as biophysics, material science, molecular modelling, marine science, geochemical modelling, computational fluid dynamics, and more recently, artificial intelligence and data analytics using deep learning.” It's been a busy few days for Australia's HPC community, as last week the National Computational Infrastructure announced that a new Lenovo NeXtScale system will boost the power of its “Raijin” facility by 40 per cent. ® UPDATE: In response to inquiries from The Reg, CSIRO has updated its tender and now says the Windows Server compatibility requirement does not apply to Power-powered servers. Some of the speculation above does not, therefore, apply. We've reported the change here.

Crunch Network How drones will reshape the enterprise Posted Nov 13, 2016 by Alexander Niehenke 0 SHARES Next Story Defining our relationship with early AI Alexander Niehenke Crunch Network Contributor Alexander Niehenke is a principal at Scale Venture Partners. How to join the network Most people associate drones with troops and mad scientists tinkering around in their backyards. Thanks to technological breakthroughs — including longer and safer flights — and new federal guidelines enacted this year, drone use is expanding beyond military and consumer markets and is seeping into the enterprise. Analysts at PwC forecast the emerging global market for drone-powered business services to be valued at more than $127 billion. DJI has ushered technical innovation into the mainstream with its popular Phantom series of off-the-shelf drones. The newest models now have enhanced gyro-stabilization capabilities and the ability to fly for triple the duration of what was possible only a couple of years ago — at a digestible cost of $1,000. Simply put, the cost and hardware have reached a point where drones are easily accessible for most enterprise use cases. The tipping point, however, came with the Federal Aviation Administration’s decision to pass Part 107 in June — now, anyone with an online certification can operate a drone for commercial purposes. Previously, the industry was limited to having individuals with a pilot’s license operate drones (both costly and cumbersome). We’re seeing a wide range of mainstream business applications for drones crop up, the breadth so esoteric it becomes hard to track. Intel just unveiled a drone designed specifically for industrial use-cases like construction site and field inspections. Oil and gas companies are using drones for rig safety and maintenance, and Amazon has made its aspirations for drone deliveries known. Seed companies marketing to the agriculture industry are giving farmers free drones and training them to survey their crops. UPS recently used a drone to deliver medicine to an island near Boston. I also recently spoke with a company that mapped whole swathes of freeway in Mexico to identify sections that needed the most repair. Resolution was not high enough with satellite imagery and car-based mapping would have taken too long, but drones completed the project in a matter of days. Drones are making a real impact on a number of industries, and quietly transforming the enterprise as we know it. There are a ton of niche applications too — from insurers assessing hail storm damage on crops to cities surveying storm water drains. The new enterprise drone market has created the need for an ecosystem to support it. On-demand “drone entrepreneurs” are working as consultants to companies that need drone pilots and service providers — think Uber for drones. For example, companies are contracting with drone operators for remote facility inspection rather than risking the safety of an employee or hiring a specialist solely for the assignment. This cottage industry of drone specialists will be essential to the viability of the enterprise drone market. Nobody has yet aggregated the number of these service providers, but I have no doubt it is already in the tens of thousands. Early on, off-the-shelf hardware solutions from producers such as DJI weren’t enterprise-ready (as highlighted above). Therefore, first-mover enterprise vendors such as Airware and Kespry built their own hardware in addition to the software ecosystem. This is shifting. More recently, the biggest development in the drone market is companies like DroneDeploy, Skycatch and Propeller, which are only focused on software. Related Articles Hangar raises $6.5 million to give companies all the drone data they want without having to fly themselves What's next for the U.S. drone market? Fixed-wing drones not quite taking off in commercial market, a new DroneDeploy study finds Aerodrome Is The First Commercial Airport For Drones These companies benefit from having to only focus on the software and the growing surrounding ecosystem of many software vendors. I expect a trend to play out similar to the commoditization of hardware within the smartphone industry — engineering your own drone hardware will rarely be worthwhile. A few promising categories for the next wave of enterprise drone software are for managing drone flight and managing drone behavior and compliance, as well as real-time data analytics processing. The media likes to tell a futuristic story of drones whizzing through our cities, clouding our skies. While not unrealistic, this reality is quite a ways out. Less talked about is how millions of drones are already in use, the value that they’re creating in the enterprise and the outcomes they’re opening up that were previously cost-prohibitive or impossible. Drones are making a real impact on a number of industries, and quietly transforming the enterprise as we know it. Much like personal IP-based telephony quietly became ubiquitous overnight, the tailwinds are such that we will soon see drones in every aspect of our lives.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 13, 2016 at 3:31PM Many investors generally see stocks tripling as a long-term goal. But some stocks can also triple within a single year. Let's examine three tech stocks which tripled investors' investments over the past year, and whether or not they still have room to run. Image source: Getty Images. AMD If you had bought shares of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) when the stock dipped below $2 per share in February, you would have more than tripled your initial investment in just nine months. That's because the chipmaker staged a remarkable turnaround over the past year on the strength of its EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) business, which was bolstered by robust sales of its semi-custom SoC for PS4s and Xbox Ones. Those sales are expected to keep rising on console upgrades like the PS4 Slim, PS4 Pro, Xbox One S, and Xbox Scorpio. In the second quarter this year, AMD posted its first quarter of annual revenue growth since 2014. It followed up that 9% growth with 23% growth in the third quarter, and anticipates 6% sales growth for the full year. AMD returned to quarterly GAAP profitability during the second quarter, and non-GAAP profitability during the third quarter. AMD is also pushing back against Nvidia in the low-end "VR ready" GPU market with the Polaris-based RX 480, and plans to target the high-end market with its next-gen Vega GPUs in the near future. Although AMD remains a distant underdog to Intel in the CPU market, it plans to counter the market leader with its upcoming Zen CPUs. Oclaro Oclaro (NASDAQ:OCLR) is a manufacturer of optical components, modules, and subsystems for the service provider, enterprise, and data center markets. If you had bought shares of Oclaro last October when it hovered around $2, you would have quadrupled your initial investment. Oclaro directly benefits from the rising bandwidth needs of streaming video, cloud computing, application virtualization, and other data-intensive applications. That rising demand boosted its revenue by 55% annually last quarter, compared to 52% growth in the previous quarter and a 2% decline in the prior-year quarter. Most of that growth was fueled by growth in its "100G and beyond" portfolio of high-speed solutions, where sales rose roughly 20% annually for the fifth straight quarter. On the bottom line, Oclaro's non-GAAP net income rose from a net loss of $1.6 million to net income of $20 million between the first quarters of 2015 and 2016. It also reported GAAP net income of $3.4 million during the quarter, versus a loss of $3.5 million a year ago. Analysts expect that growth to continue, with revenue and non-GAAP earnings expect to respectively rise 44% and 206% this year. Weibo Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), commonly referred to as "China's Twitter (NYSE:TWTR)," has more than tripled in value since last October. That explosive growth can be attributed to its rapid growth in monthly active users (MAUs), which grew 33% annually to 282 million last quarter, compared to 36% growth in the prior-year quarter. The company -- which is owned by online media giant Sina (NASDAQ:SINA) -- has posted triple and double-digit sales growth in every quarter since its IPO in April 2014, and analysts expect its sales to rise 33% this year, compared to 43% growth in 2015. Those numbers are enormous when compared to Twitter's anemic 3% year-over-year growth in MAUs and projected sales growth of 15% this year. Weibo is also profitable by both non-GAAP and GAAP metrics, while Twitter is only profitable on a non-GAAP basis. Between the second quarters of 2015 and 2016, Weibo's GAAP net income rose from $4.2 million to $25.9 million, while its non-GAAP net income surged from $10.9 million to $35.5 million. Analysts expect its non-GAAP net income to more than double this year. Weibo's advertising and marketing revenue rose 45% annually last quarter, fueled by ad buys from small and medium sized businesses nearly doubling. It offers display ads, interest-based ad campaigns, event-based ad campaigns, and promoted feeds. Weibo's new live streaming platform, which allows viewers to buy virtual gifts from the company for their favorite broadcasters, is also boosting its revenue growth. The key takeaway Investors should always remember that past performance doesn't guarantee future returns. However, AMD is still in turnaround mode, while Oclaro and Weibo still seem to be firing on all cylinders. Therefore, I believe that these stocks could still have room to run, despite having more than tripled investors' cash over the past year. Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The Linux Foundation The line between containers and VMs can be thought of as a continuum, according to Graham Whaley, Sr. Software Engineer at Intel. In his keynote at LinuxCon Europe, he talked about the spectrum between fully featured, accelerated, secure, VM features all the way down to the barest minimum lightweight container. He says, “Some people want one end of the spectrum, really time-critical, other people want security. We don't have that today. What we'd like is a continuous choice of features. … That’s something we’re trying to enable.” Whaley also talked about two VM myths: VMs don't have to be big: “I've seen embedded systems running hypervisors with tiny amounts of RAM. Admittedly, that VM may not have the features that you want to run a container, but it's not actually that far off. Containers don't require that many features at the bottom end.” And they aren’t always slow: “Along with, or parallel with, ‘I'm big,’ comes slow. If you're not that big, it's pretty hard to be slow, if you're very very small. Yeah, VMs don't have to be this humongous behemoth that you can't really use in your container space because they're just too slow. That's a legacy thing. We can move beyond that." Whaley talked about “re-imagining what we can do in the whole container cloud stack” with the goal of making a tenfold improvement in performance. The key to getting this kind of performance improvement is to take a fresh look without assuming that you need something equivalent to a self-contained PC. Their approach is to “throw that away, start again, and pick out the pieces we need from the VM.” By being very selective and only including the bare minimum of what is needed along with also using some new technologies that increase performance, they are getting sub-50-millisecond boot times with around 50MB per container instance overhead. Whaley wraps it up with more information about next steps and where you can go to participate: “We do continue to optimize space and speed. Really, we want to look for that next tenfold improvement. What's that next leap of faith, that change of architecture? We are redefining what's possible. We're an open project. … The code is available now on GitHub. We have an IRC channel and mailing list. Come to the web site where there's Clear Linux, Clear Containers and Ciao.” Watch the entire video to learn more about the Clear Linux project and Intel’s approach to improving performance of containers and VMs. Log in or register to post comments Print This Like  (1 like) Click Here!

Elroy Bethell - November 13, 2016 7:32 AM Print Recipient E-mail Sender E-mail CPUs are always changing, always improving. In fact, to stay competitive chip makers have to continue horning their skills and improving their products. Intel constantly stays on top by bringing new tech to the market. We all have a desire to get the best of the best computers out there.  However, every computer user eventually comes to the realization that the computer they bought is either not powerful enough, or has too much power to be practical for their needs. If price is not an object, then too much power is not so bad.  I don’t think any computer is truly future proof, but high-end computer stuff is as close as you can get.  My wife wanted to buy me a laptop that housed a Core i3 processor. It was the lowest of the bunch and know I need much more power than that for what I do. But for someone else, a laptop with a Core i3 is a nice budget processor that may meet all their needs.      Photo Source: Intel   Picking a computer with an i3, i5, or i7 should be entirely based on your budget and computing needs. A Core i5 processor is a good mid-range point if you great computing power without spending too much money.     Photo Source: Intel      For most computing needs, an i7 processor is not a must have.

The company launched the updated version of its Blade notebook a few weeks ago. Razer has been selling it directly to customers since then but if someone wants to pick one up via Microsoft’s online store, they can now do that. Microsoft’s online store is offering the Razer Blade notebook in two different configurations. The updated Razer Blade notebook is powered by the latest Core i7-6700HQ processor from Intel coupled with 16GB of RAM. It features a full HD 14 inch display as well as an NVIDIA GTX 1060 graphics processor which makes this notebook ready for virtual reality. The Razer Blade is powered by Windows 10. All of this is packaged inside a body that measures 0.7 inches thick and comes in at just 4 pounds. No major changes have been made to the design of the notebook, everything that’s worth paying good money for is packaged inside the shell. Microsoft’s online store is selling the new Razer Blade with 512GB SSD for $1,999 and with a 1TB solid-state drive for $2,399. Interestingly, the 512GB configuration is already listed as out of stock so it’s unclear how long it’s going to take for this particular model to be back in stock. Filed in Computers.

Donald Trump’s promises trigger fears of a trade war that would damage Washington’s economy By John Webster johnwe@spokesman.com(509) 459-5421 Twitter Facebook Email Reddit Related topics China reportedly pumping brakes on U.S. deal-making after Trump win If President Donald Trump keeps the promises of candidate Donald Trump, he could trigger a trade war with China, dissolve tariff-reduction deals around the Pacific Rim, and inflict a “disastrous” blow to the economy of trade-dependent Washington state. So says Democrat Gary Locke, the Chinese-American trade expert who served eight years as Washington state governor, two years as U.S. secretary of commerce and three years as U.S. ambassador to China. But out in Eastern Washington’s crop-growing country, which voted strongly in favor of Trump, farmers feel optimistic that they can persuade the new president to govern differently than he campaigned. John Stuhlmiller, CEO of the conservative Washington state Farm Bureau, said it is true that China has a history of the retaliation Locke predicts – a retaliation that “would be terrible for our economy, absolutely.” But the need to avoid a trade war is why, Stuhlmiller said, “I would submit there is room for movement from rhetoric to reality.” Stuhlmiller said Trump’s policy advisers already have told the Farm Bureau that Trump will repeal the Obama administration’s Clean Water Act rules concerning runoff – rules that many farmers consider damaging and excessive. The president-elect’s responsiveness to farmers on that issue makes farmers optimistic that Trump will respond favorably to farmers’ concerns regarding foreign trade, Stuhlmiller said. Bigger even than agriculture is Boeing. It sells jets, made in Washington, around the world. In 2015, Washington made and exported $86.3 billion worth of merchandise. More than half – $51 billion – was civilian aircraft. The largest market for Washington state products? China, at $20.7 billion in purchases during 2014. Those purchases include Boeing jets, fresh Wenatchee cherries that fly to China by the planeload, Yakima Valley hops for the brewers of Asian beer, and frozen french fries made in Moses Lake from local potatoes and devoured by the ton at China’s more than 2,200 McDonald’s restaurants. Other buyers of Washington state exports include Canada at $9.3 billion in purchases, Japan at $7.4 billion, and Mexico at $2.7 billion. The manufacture and shipping of these export products account for 1 in 3 of Washington state’s jobs, according to the state Department of Commerce. Those jobs are in Boeing’s factories, Eastern Washington’s family wheat farms, Columbia Valley’s wineries, Central Washington’s orchards and the thriving Port of Moses Lake, where more than 2,500 workers assemble semiconductors for Intel, carbon-fiber body panels for BMW’s electric cars, Genie construction lifts and more. Those jobs, said Locke, are what is at stake – along with the U.S. trade deficit, which gets better when Washington’s exports improve and worse when they decline. What is it, exactly, that candidate Trump said to provoke these Washington state concerns? He promised repeatedly to impose a 45 percent tariff on goods made in China and sold to the United States. He also said he would scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an Obama administration trade pact involving 12 Pacific Rim countries; the deal awaits final approval in Congress, where leaders last week were calling it dead. China is not a party to the TPP, but many other Washington state trading partners are would-be members. He said he would renegotiate or scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he lambasted as a job-killing deal that gutted American manufacturing since its passage in the 1990s. Peter Navarro, a Trump trade adviser, explained in a Los Angeles Times op-ed that the 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports would be a “strategic negotiating strategy to stop China … from cheating on international trade deals.” China, Navarro wrote, “has been waging an undeclared trade war on the U.S. since joining the World Trade Organization in 2001. The casualties are obvious: More than 50,000 American factories shuttered.” Meanwhile, Navarro wrote, “the unfair trade advantages China reaps from lax environmental and health and safety regulations are written in blood: More than 60,000 Chinese workers perished in workplace accidents in 2014 and up to a half-million people die prematurely because of China’s horrific air pollution.” Robert Hamilton, senior trade policy adviser in the Washington state Department of Commerce, said if Trump imposes an across-the-board 45 percent tariff on Chinese products, it “would be a blatant violation of WTO rules. Does he intend to pull out of the WTO? He hasn’t said so, so it is unclear how he would proceed against China, Washington’s largest export market,” Hamilton said. Further, Hamilton said, “I understand President-elect Trump wants to renegotiate NAFTA, but he has provided no details about what he would propose. Moreover, Canada and Mexico will be at the table, too, and they will not just give concessions to the United States.” According to former Gov. Locke, if Trump imposes a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports, “China will reciprocate and put a similar tax on goods from Washington – whether it’s wheat, hops or Boeing airplanes. That will force Chinese buyers to buy from Brazil or Chile or Australia in terms of agricultural products and from Europe in terms of airplanes.” “They don’t have to buy from Boeing,” Locke added. The market for passenger jets is competitive; Airbus eagerly would sell to China if retaliatory Chinese taxes and tariffs made Boeing’s U.S.-made jets uncompetitive in price. If retaliatory trade policies block Washington state companies from selling to China, “it means layoffs” for Washington workers, Locke said. “It could be quite disastrous for jobs in the state of Washington,” he said. In addition, Trump’s threatened tariff on Chinese products would raise the price of the merchandise Americans buy at stores like Wal-Mart, Home Depot and Macy’s, Locke said. “That will be taken out of the pockets of American workers.” Primary provisions of the TPP, Locke said, are agreements to lower tariffs currently imposed by U.S. trading partners, and to bind those countries to improve the treatment of their own workers and cut down on the use of hazardous agricultural chemicals. In return for those agreements, nations in the TPP secure the mutual benefits of freer trade, Locke said. If other countries “can make things without health and human safety standards, it puts American companies at a disadvantage,” Locke said, because U.S. producers do invest in higher standards of health and safety. “That’s what TPP is trying to address, is level the playing field” so U.S. products have a fair shot in the competition for foreign buyers. Regarding the TPP, the Farm Bureau agreed: In its meetings with the new Trump administration, Stuhlmiller said, “Ag is going to be saying ‘Please support it.’ ” Under terms of the TPP, stringent U.S. environmental standards “would be a base for others to have to attain to. Others would have to pay more to produce crops, and that gives us an advantage; our products must become more cost-competitive,” Stuhlmiller said. “Where we excel is we have the world’s safest and best food supply. It goes at a premium,” Stuhlmiller said. This premium quality has contributed to the worldwide success of Washington’s big-money crops such as apples, cherries and wheat, he said. But it takes a level playing field, with lower tariffs and comparable production rules, for trade fully to benefit makers and buyers alike, he said. According to the Farm Bureau, the TPP would increase Washington state’s export income by $246 million per year and add more than 1,350 jobs to the state’s economy. Boeing, like the Farm Bureau, has expressed the hope it can work out concerns with the president-elect. After Trump’s election victory, the company issued this formal statement: “We congratulate president-elect Trump and newly elected members of Congress and look forward to working with them to ensure that U.S. companies can compete, win and grow our economy to provide good jobs to U.S. workers; as well as preserve American leadership in national security.” Will Trump, who campaigned to increase U.S. jobs and reduce the deficit in U.S. trade, respond to the concerns of Washington state export industries? Stuhlmiller predicted he will: During campaign season “rhetoric is rhetoric.” But governing, he said, is a different story. “We hope we will be able to reason our way through these things and find the right policy path forward. Farmers are the eternal optimists. We put everything at risk every year and hope the Lord provides the rain.” Published: Nov. 13, 2016, 6:15 a.m.  Tags: apples, Boeing, cherries, china, Donald Trump, farm bureau, foreign trade, jobs, NAFTA, Washington state economy, wheat Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Unlimited Digital Access Print edition home delivery Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Why the MacBook Pro reviews are all wrong Nate Swanner - Nov 13, 2016 75 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit If you take a look around the web, you’ll already find plenty of reviews about the new MacBook Pro. To date, only the non-Touch Bar 13-inch model has been made available, with other models arriving sometime next week (if you ordered early). All told, the reviews are less than glowing, with many likening the computer to a farce foisted on us by Apple. That’s certainly one way to look at it, but there’s probably something a bit more obvious at play. The ‘Pro’ computer Reading through the reviews, a few things becomes fairly evident. First, the new keyboard is going to be polarizing (I happen to love it) with its shallow key travel. Second, the massive trackpad is a welcome addition. Another notable feature on the 13-inch model is the screen. While the same resolution as the previous Retina Pro models, it’s now a lot brighter and supports the P3 color gamut. It’s just plain beautiful. But there are some professional-level disadvantages. It’s got a pretty basic CPU, the GPU is limited to Intel’s offering, and the two Thunderbolt 3 ports are going to leave you buying dongles — another not-so-pro feature many are complaining about. For all the complaining, one thing is certain: the new 13-inch, non-Touch Bar Pro is not a ‘pro’ computer at all. Often, reviews append their long-winded ranting with that notation at the end, but it misses the mark. This is Apple’s fault What we’ve quickly forgotten is that most of those reviewing the new Pro (the pesky tech press, wouldn’t you know) were ardent fanboys of the MacBook Air. I can’t tell you how many conferences I’ve been to, only to see a sea of Airs floating through the halls while I lugged my Pro around. We’ve (the royal ‘we’ here) also lost track of the biggest complaint about the Air: the screen. For so long the only thing the tech press wanted was an Air with a Retina screen. It would be the perfect computer, they’d say. Then they got one — except Apple dubbed it a ‘Pro’ computer. The Air was judged apart from the Pro because it was this sliver of aluminum Steve Jobs slipped out of an inter-office envelope and positioned as the entry-level MacBook to encompass the world outside of Pros. You know, the 99 percent (sorry ‘pros’… complain all you want, but you’re not what matters). It had pretty ho-hum specs and a middling screen resolution — but oh, the form factor! So slim, so pretty… so portable, and easy to balance on a lap while live-blogging a keynote speech from a tech conference! Instead of simply rebooting the Air lineup, Apple gave us a confusing Pro stable to pick through. Do we want the Pro non-Touch, or one with Touch Bar — and 13 or 15 inch? Did you need more RAM? Yeah, that’s only available on the 15-inch version. Sorry. The Pro is not a Pro Apple calling the 13-inch non-Touch Bar MacBook Pro (and screw them for making me type that, it’s a stupid-long name) a ‘Pro’ at all is problematic. Instead of simply rebooting the Air with a Retina screen — you know, that thing we wanted — Apple rebooted the Air with a Retina screen and called it a Pro. Except it’s not a Pro. It’s an Air… with a Retina screen. But the tech press is holding the computer to a different standard than it would a new Air, despite being very aware of what they’re doing. If Apple had simply called its basic offering a new Air, the only knock would be the form factor being exactly like the Pro (and probably Thunderbolt ports, but whatever). Even then, we wouldn’t care much… at least we’d know where it stood in the lineup. And then we’d have that ‘Air with a Retina screen’ so many have always wanted. I mean, Apple even pulled the 11-inch Air from circulation, and isn’t updating the 13-inch model. It’s clearly trying to exhaust its existing supply chain — so what other indicators do we need that the Air is dead and this new thing is its replacement? The naming scheme is Apple’s fault, but it’s poor form on the tech press for not being able to see through it more directly. That so many hold the low-end Pro to the ‘Pro’ standard Apple sets is silly. Call it what you like, it’s clearly the new Air — and should be judged as such.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) — The state of emergency was introduced in France as the initiative of the President Francois Hollande after the November tragedy and has been extended three times since then. The latest six-month extension began on July 26. © REUTERS/ Philippe Wojazer Year After Paris Attacks EU Not Totally Safe Despite Heightened Security - Ex-Intel Officer "The state of emergency allows us to make arrests and employ other administrative measures that are very effective… Therefore, yes, we will probably extend the emergency state for a few more months," Valls told BBC's HARDtalk program. Valls added that it would be difficult to cancel the emergency state as the presidential campaign would soon begin with its meetings and mass gatherings. © Sputnik/ Vladimir Pesnya What Is Known About November 2015 Paris Terrorist Attacks The French presidential election is scheduled for April and May 2017. The prime minister noted that the risk of attacks similar to those that targeted Paris on November 13, 2015, leaving 130 people dead, was decreasing. However, Valls noted, there is still a menace of attacks similar to what happened in Nice in July, where a truck rammed into a crowd, killing 86. The Paris attacks were carefully coordinated and carried out by a group of terrorist, whereas the one in Nice was conducted by one person. ...

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 12, 2016 at 5:04PM The Internet of Things (IoT) -- which connects wearables, smart home appliances, and other devices to the internet -- has been widely hyped as the next big growth market by tech companies. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) claims that the number of connected devices will surge from 15 billion in 2015 to 200 billion by 2020. That's a whopping 26 smart objects tethered to every person on the earth. Image source: Getty Images. Bullish forecasts like those sparked a land grab in the IoT market, with companies often pumping out connected objects before considering the privacy and security implications. That lack of oversight became brutally clear recently with a series of cyberattacks which exploited unsecured IoT devices to take down major websites like Twitter, Shopify, and Spotify. If these attacks get worse, could the dream of connecting "everything" to the internet suddenly seem like a really bad idea? Rise of the robots One of the most common ways to knock a website offline is with a DDoS (distributed denial of service) attack. In this attack, hordes of devices which are infected by malware act as "bots" to continually flood traffic to a targeted site and knock it offline. In the past, these networks of infected devices, called "botnets", were mainly comprised of computers. As the security of traditional PCs improved, botnets spread toward other connected devices like smartphones and tablets. But now that mobile OS defenses are improving, hackers have started targeting IoT devices. Many security experts have warned that many IoT devices can be hacked with simple attacks which were blocked on PCs years ago. Nonetheless, many companies looking to capitalize on the growth of the IoT market threw caution to the wind as they launched a wide array of connected devices. This created the perfect opportunity for IoT botnets to strike. The Mirai botnet, which primarily targets remote cameras and home routers, was recently used in several major DDoS attacks on cybersecurity journalist Brian Kreb's website, French web host OVH, and internet directory service Dyn, plus the entire internet infrastructure of Liberia. To make matters worse, the source code for Mirai was recently released online, guaranteeing that more advanced Mirai-based attacks will follow. Will those "smart home" dreams evaporate? The security problems plaguing the IoT could hurt tech giants, which are trying to establish smart home ecosystems. Big players in this market include Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Google's Nest, Home, and Cast products create a smart home ecosystem which controls the temperature, answers questions, receives commands, and "casts" music and video to various screens and audio devices around the home. Samsung's SmartThings ecosystem connects various smart appliances to each other and its mobile app. Apple's HomeKit tethers third-party devices to its iOS app, while Amazon does the same with its Echo smart speakers. Facebook hasn't formally entered the smart home race yet, but it's already teased a home AI platform for controlling connected lights and thermostats. Google Home. Image source: Google. These companies all want to expand their internet presence into physical homes to increase user dependence on their hardware, software, or services. But if Mirai-like attacks continue knocking websites offline and making global headlines, consumers will likely think twice before upgrading all their "dumb" appliances to "smart" ones. So who's trying to protect the IoT? The Mirai botnet sounds scary, but companies are developing countermeasures, just as they previously did with PCs and mobile devices. Companies on the front line include networking giant Cisco, cybersecurity giant Symantec, and next-gen firewall vendors Palo Alto Networks and Check Point Software. Threat prevention firms like FireEye have also been improving their software to recognize these IoT-based botnet attacks. There are also new security measures in the RTOS (real-time operating systems) which run on IoT chips. ARM Holdings, which was recently acquired by Softbank, previously beefed up the security of its mBed RTOS with the acquisitions of security firms Offspark and Sansa Security, as well as a partnership with IBM. Intel's IoT chips run on its VxWorks RTOS, which is secured by Intel Security (which is being spun off with a majority stake sold to TPG) software, which is tethered to Intel's IoT Gateway. The road ahead... These efforts indicate that progress is being made, but the IoT market can be tough to secure due to the wide variety of different devices on the market. This hardware and software fragmentation makes it easier for hackers to exploit vulnerabilities and harder for security companies to counter the attacks. If this continues to happen, the bullish sentiment for the IoT market could fade, but cybersecurity companies would benefit from rising demand for IoT security services.   Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

New Photo of the x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Gets Leaked GO Here is the Dell Stack along with its planned dock Nov 13, 2016 07:38 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Earlier this week, it has emerged that Dell wanted to build an x86 Windows 10 Mobile device tackling several markets at the same time, as it was supposed to play the role of a phone, tablet, and desktop using the full power of Windows 10. Called Dell Stack, this device was originally designed in 2014 and planned for launch in 2017, but for the moment, it’s believed that both Dell and Microsoft gave up on the project, so it might never see daylight. And yet, new photos get leaked to the web thanks to leaker Evan Blass, who just posted a photo showing the Dell Stack along with its dock, which is believed to support Continuum and offer charging at the same time. As you can see in this pic, the Dell Slack seems to be very thin, which makes many wonder how could an Intel Kaby Lake processor be installed under the hood, given the fact that cooling is critical for an x86 chip. For the moment, however, there are quite a lot of uncertain things, especially because neither Microsoft nor Dell confirmed that they still want to release the phone. Possible specs According to leaked information, the Dell Slack was designed with a 6.4-inch display and was supposed to launch in several hardware configurations boasting either 4 GB or 8 GB of RAM. Depending on version, users would have been allowed to get up to 256 GB of storage space, with microSD card obviously supported for additional space. In terms of processors, Dell wanted the Slack to come with a choice of three different Intel Kaby Lake Y x86 processors, including m3, m5 vPro, and m7 vPro. This would have ensured x86 app support, without compromising battery life, although there’s no information regarding battery capacity. Since Dell originally planned to launch the Slack in 2017, there’s still hope that the company could bring it to the market at some point, so fingers crossed to see this going live. x86 seems to be the only way to save Windows phones and tackle the lack of apps, and it’s believed that Microsoft itself is also looking in the same direction with its planned Surface Phone. #Dell#Windows 10 Mobile#Windows phone#Microsoft subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news After iOS and Android, Windows 10 Mobile Finally Getting Authenticator App Windows 10 Mobile Phone with Physical Keyboard in the Works Microsoft Releases Windows 10 Mobile Build 14393.448 HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile First Impressions Firefox 50.0 Officially Released for Linux, Mac and Windows, Here's What's New Some U.S. Android Phones Have Secret Backdoor That Sends Data to China Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall Hackers Steal FIFA Currency, Buy Houses and Expensive Cars with the Money Microsoft Pledges to Completely Retire Office 2007 Next Year X.Org Server 1.19.0 Officially Released, Coming Soon to a Linux Distro Near You Red Hat Software Collections 2.3 and Red Hat Developer Toolset 6 Available Now Linux Kernel 4.4.32 LTS Adds Networking Improvements, Updated AMDGPU Drivers    Dell Slack and its dock New Apps GdPicture.NET Document Imaging SDK: Full-Featured and Royalty Free Document Imaging toolkit for .NET allows you to implement viewing, processing, printing or scanning files SmartFTP FTP Library: Integrate FTP and SFTP file transfer capabilities into your software with the help of this advanced FTP library ActiveX component (COM) Norton AntiVirus Virus Definitions: Signature packanges containing the latest free virus databases for various Symantec antivirus software for both home and business use Curse: Connect, chat, share files and send messages to friends from the games you are playing fast and easy with this intuitive application Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool: Detects viruses and other infections that may have reached one's computer with the aid of different scan modes provided by Kaspersky MediaGet: Search and download torrents from the Internet, being able to use the integrated media player to watch movies without even saving them to your PC first App Builder: Visually design HTML5 apps in a variety of sizes, without prior knowledge of programming techniques, thanks to this straightforward tool Reader comments The New Microsoft Is Playing Dirty like the Old Microsoft, Says Salesforce CEO more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Go Phones Laptops Cameras TV Gaming Wearables Forum MORE All articles Best picks Drones Car Tech Smart Home Gift Ideas Downloads Login Follow Us Follow Us Subscribe Security Review Panda Security 2017 Review by Brian Nadel Nov 14, 2016, 8:18 AM Panda 2017 The good Customizable interface Basic suite loaded with extra features Ransomware protection The bad Slow full scans Mediocre malware detection Changes browser search provider and home page Expensive Verdict Panda's antivirus products have an appealing interface, but they suffer from heavy system impact and middling malware protection. 6/10 Worth considering $49.99 Panda Antivirus From a free virus scanner to the company's top-of-the-line Gold Protection package, Panda Security provides satisfactory protection along with a slew of extras for which competitors often charge more. Panda's Antivirus Pro program is one of the most complete basic security packages we've seen, and comes with a virtual keyboard, two-way firewall and Wi-Fi network scanner. Yet while all the Panda products present an appealing, customizable interface, and the mid-range and premium suites add many useful features, their shared malware-detection engine delivers a heavy system-performance impact. The higher-tier suites are pricey compared with rival brands, and even the most expensive Panda suite tried to change our default web browser's home page and search engine, something we'd previously seen only with free software. Costs and What's Covered Panda Free Antivirus provides the most basic protection at no cost. This can be augmented with the Antivirus Pro version, starting at $40 for one PC for one year. (It's $60 for three PCs, and $80 for five.) Antivirus Pro includes competent malware protection and safe web browsing, as well as an Android antivirus program battery-life optimizer and extensions for an Android Smartwatch. Users of Android and iOS systems also can tag a stolen or lost device on a map. Panda Antivirus Pro 2017 $19.99 Panda The next step up is to Internet Security, which covers a single computer for one year for $50, three computers for $75 or five for $100. It adds parental controls, backup software and the company's Data Shield to protect files from ransomware. Panda Internet Security 2017 $24.99 Panda Internet Security also includes a single license for Panda's Mac antivirus software, normally $70 per year, but only if you buy Internet Security for multiple PCs. The Mac software can also perform malware scans on attached iPhones or iPads. The nearly-top-of-the-line Global Protection package adds a password manager, file encryption and a file shredder, as well as a performance optimizer. It starts at $70 for a single computer for one year. (Three computers are $105, and five are $140.) Panda Global Protection 2017 $34.99 Panda Panda Gold Protection, the package that we directly evaluated, is mostly identical to Panda Global Protection, but adds 24/7 tech support and 20GB of online storage space. It can cover a single computer for $95 for one year, or up to 10 computers for $255 per year. Panda Gold Protection 2017 $47.49 Panda Panda's prices ramp up rather quickly the more devices you add (although discounts can often be found online). Antivirus Pro is $60 for three PCs per year, which matches most competitors. But it's $80 for five PCs, $105 for 10 and $130 for an unlimited number. By comparison, Bitdefender Antivirus Pro is $80 for 10 PCs, and its top-of-the-line Bitdefender Family Pack is $120 for unlimited devices. McAfee's mid-range Internet Security package is $80 per year and can also be installed on an unlimited number of devices. Panda's products support Windows XP with Service Pack 3 through Windows 10. The Mac software supports OS X 10.6 or newer. Panda's Android apps require Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich or later, and its iOS software (really just a device locator) requires at least iOS 7.0. Antivirus Protection Panda's malware protection is the same for all its Windows antivirus products. The protection starts with traditional viral-signature matching, which compares new files against a large database of known malware using the company's home-grown scanning engine. This is backed up by "heuristic" monitoring, which catches new "zero-day" and shape-shifting malware by analyzing its behavior, code and other characteristics. Panda's 30 million customers feed suspect malware to Panda's cloud-based Collective Intelligence system for analysis. Unlike many antivirus companies, Panda won't let you opt out of this sample-collection system if you have privacy concerns. Malware signatures are updated several times a day. You can manually initiate a full scan of the entire system, a Critical Scan of key areas and files, or scans of individual files or folders. You can schedule full or critical scans to run daily, weekly or monthly. MORE: Best Antivirus Protection for PC, Mac and Android If a USB drive is inserted, Panda alerts you and scans the drive's contents. You can also "vaccinate" thumb drives so that executable files won't automatically run upon connection. Antivirus Performance Panda's malware-protection software caught most of the attacks thrown at it in evaluations conducted by German independent testing lab AV-TEST, but missed a few threats and delivered several false positives. AV-TEST's most recent survey of antivirus software brands on Windows 10 showed that in March 2016, Panda Free Antivirus stopped 100 percent of widespread, known malware and 99.9 percent of new zero-day malware. In April, those figures were 99.8 percent and 99.9 percent, respectively. In the Windows 10 tests, Panda Free Antivirus returned two false positives in each month, less than the industry average of three. By comparison, Kaspersky Internet Security had perfect scores against both categories of malware in each month, with no false positives. In AV-TEST's most recent Windows 8.1 runs, Panda's detection rates fell to 97.8 percent of widespread malware and 99.7 percent of zero-day malware in May 2016, and 98.6 percent of known malware and 99.8 percent of brand-new malware in June. Panda Free Antivirus had one false positive each month, much better than the industry average of six and better than Bitdefender Internet Security's four false positives each month. Panda's false-positive rate returned to the mean in AV-TEST's Windows 7 evaluations in July and August 2016. Panda Free Antivirus notched up five in the first month and seven in the second, matching the industry average of six per month. MORE: Best Mobile Password Managers The software caught 99.8 percent of zero-day malware in July, and 96.2 percent in August; it caught 99.8 percent of widespread malware in each month. In contrast, Bitdefender Internet Security caught all the malware in each month, but registered three false positives in July. (We often include evaluations conducted by an Austrian lab, AV-Comparatives, but Panda did not participate in that lab's most recent tests.) Security and Privacy Features Each paid Panda product covers the basics well, with malware and anti-phishing defenses, but treats spam as just another assault. Panda Antivirus Pro is pretty well-stocked with extra features for a basic product: It comes with a virtual keyboard to stop keylogging malware from collecting your passwords, as well as a license for Panda's Android antivirus app. There's also a two-way firewall to take over from the Windows one, a Wi-Fi scanner to look for network insecurities and display all connected devices, and browser extensions to keep your identity secure by checking the reputation of sites before you arrive. None of the Panda products offer a hardened browser for online shopping or banking. The Internet Security package adds strong parental controls that can prevent children from being exposed to objectionable themes, ranging from alcohol use to the merely tasteless. I liked that you can see where your children have surfed and what's been blocked. There's a Data Shield to prevent must-keep files (such as photos and tax records) from being encrypted by a ransomware attack, and backup software for rebuilding a broken or infected system. (You'll need to save the archives locally.) Panda's Global Protection suite adds several useful, if nonessential, tools. A password manager works with both third-party applications and websites; a file shredder and a separate file encryptor safeguard or destroy anything that should never see the light of day; a system optimizer eliminates duplicate, temporary and old files; and an anti-theft system will track your lost or stolen PC on a map – as long as the PC is still turned on. Panda Gold Protection is basically Global Protection, except with backups for your contacts on any device, as well as 20GB of online storage space. It also offers Panda's "premium" tech support, which includes 24/7 access to technicians via chat or remote access, weekend telephone support and basic assistance with any issue regarding your computers and smartphones. Users of the less expensive products have to make do with emailed queries and telephone technicians available only during East Coast business hours. While most antivirus companies require you to download software and burn it to a CD to create a rescue disk, Panda's Rescue Kit is built into all its paid products. It lets you either create a startup USB thumb drive (sorry, no CDs or DVDs) or open up a separate application that uses the Panda Cloud Cleaner to scan and disinfect your computer directly from the internet. Performance and System Impact Panda Gold Protection not only slowed down our test computer significantly, but also scanned our hard drive more slowly than other antivirus products. (There's often a trade-off between system-performance impact and scanning speed.) The test machine was an ASUS X555LA notebook with a 2-GHz Intel Core i3 processor, 6GB of RAM and a 500GB hard drive, 36GB of which was filled. The system ran Windows 10 with the latest updates. Performance was assessed by the completion time of our OpenOffice-based stress test, which matches 20,000 names and addresses in a spreadsheet. We ran the test in four scenarios: with no antivirus software installed; after the Panda software was installed; during full scans; and during "critical" scans. We established a baseline by running the OpenOffice test with no malware software installed, but with Microsoft's Windows Defender running by default. The test completed its tasks in 7 minutes and 1 second. After Panda Gold Protection was installed, the same routine took 7 minutes and 25 seconds, indicating a moderate passive slowdown of 5.7 percent. We've seen worse, but a rival product, Kaspersky Total Security, had zero impact. During a full scan, the OpenOffice test took 10 minutes and 2 seconds, a 43 percent slowdown compared to the baseline. That's fairly heavy — Bitdefender Total Security notched up an 18 percent hit. A Critical Scan — Panda's approximation of a quick scan — resulted in an Open-Office result of 9:10, a 31 percent performance hit comparable to that of Trend Micro Maximum Security, but much more than Kaspersky Total Security's 5.5 percent quick-scan impact. It took 1 hour and 44 minutes for Panda Gold Protection to perform its initial full scan of all 471,545 files on our hard drive. Because the first scan often takes the longest, we ran it several more times, after which it settled down to about 54 minutes each time, putting it on a par with Bitdefender's leisurely 51 minutes. Trend Micro and Kaspersky each scanned the same drive in less than 5 minutes, but at a cost: Each had much higher system impacts than Bitdefender. Panda, unfortunately, seemed to have the worst of both worlds, with both high system-performance impacts and long full-scan times. Panda's Critical Scan looks for the most pressing attacks, and it took an average of 2 minutes and 56 second to examine 27,431 files. That's slow compared with the quick scans of rival brands, such as Bitdefender (8.9 seconds) or Kaspersky (1 minute and 51 seconds), yet Panda's was more taxing in terms of performance. MORE: Best VPN Services for Staying Anonymous Online Interface Panda's interface hasn't changed since last year. Dominated by a stylized panda-head silhouette, the main window lacks the checkmark that dominates security software today. Instead, the program displays "Protected." The main window's default has a scan button that lets you start a critical or full scan in two clicks. Below that button is a box to add coverage to more devices, followed by a Support button and a display that shows when the subscription expires. Unlike other security software, Panda lets you customize its interface by moving items among its three pages of features. Want Parental Controls in your face? Drag it to the front page. However, the interface has two box sizes that aren't interchangeable. With Panda's regular tech support, technicians are available Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Eastern time for toll-free telephone and email help. This doesn't measure up to Bitdefender's 24/7 telephone support; the Premium tech support that comes with Gold Protection lets you speak to technicians on evenings and weekends, but not in the wee hours of the morning.  Setup and Installation Loading Panda's consumer products onto a PC starts with a 1.8MB installer program, which does a compatibility and malware check. After you input the activation code, the rest of the program downloads, updates and installs. At the end of the process, you'll need set up an online account, but be warned: Panda wants to change your default web browser's search engine and homepage to Yahoo and Panda, respectively. You'll need to find and unclick two pre-checked permissions boxes during the installation process to maintain your online status quo. (We've seen this somewhat underhanded behavior with some free antivirus programs, but never with a paid one until now.) Like many other antivirus installers, Panda's sets you up for auto-renewal on your credit card when the subscription expires. You can avoid this by digging into the program's settings. Bottom Line Panda's antivirus products provide reasonable protection against the worst that the internet can throw at a Windows PC, but they are slow to scan, put a burden on the system and want to take over your search engine and homepage. The benefits of each Panda paid product vary. The basic Antivirus Plus program does quite a lot for a little, and is a good choice for fully protecting one or two computers, although Bitdefender Antivirus Plus has better malware protection and a smaller system impact. But as you rise through the company's Internet Security, Global Protection and Gold Protection suites, the prices rise quickly, and there's no unlimited plan for the top-level Gold product. Panda falls short of the mark for large digital families looking for lots of protection at a reasonable price — for those, we recommend Bitdefender Total Security Multi-Device or Kaspersky Total Security.

Decker arrives at CP+B from Omnicom shopper marketing agency The Integer Group of Lakewood, Colorado. He spent over eight years there, most recently serving as VP of insight and strategy and leading planning on the Kellogg, PepsiCo, MillerCoors, and P&G accounts. Before that he spent two years as insights director with 72andSunny, handling strategy and research for various clients including Discovery, Nike, Quiksilver and Roxy. Decker began his career as an ecologist and earned a PhD in urban ecology and human evolution from the University of New Mexico and also spent time at Boulder ethnographic research firm Radar Communications, where he contributed to global research for Intel and Unilever. He has presented on marketing science at SXSW, TED and other events. “What we love most about Ethan is that despite his deep expertise and scientific mind, he’s always willing to throw it all away and invent something completely new,” CP+B chief strategy officer Eric Zuncic, who joined the agency in July of 2015, said in a statement. “His innate sense of curiosity and creativity, backed by the rigor of real scientific analysis is a rare find in our world. Most importantly, our creatives noted that he is the ‘Perfect amount of weird to help us make great work’ – which is about as good a compliment as I’ve ever heard.” < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Jude Abastar 15 November 2016 Email Print More Sharing Services Share Tweet How will the upcoming Microsoft Surface Phone change the public's perception towards Windows-based smartphones?REUTERS/Dado Ruvic Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today Considering the amount of success Microsoft has achieved in the software and computer industry, the American company couldn't get it right when it came to grabbing a share of the smartphone segment. The Redmond-based tech giant already made substantial investments in this particular industry but has not seen a return of it. With the ever-increasing dominance of Apple and Samsung in the smartphone business, is there really room for the rumored Microsoft Surface Phone? Next year's upcoming line of highly anticipated smartphones includes the iPhone 8 and the Galaxy S8, while Microsoft's Surface Phone, although still unconfirmed, is lurking in the shadows of those two. But what sort of distinction does it have for consumers to even consider it as a competing device for the industry's leading flagship ranges? For one, Microsoft Devices' corporate vice president Panos Panay has said that they currently are working hard in order to provide consumers with a "revolutionary" Windows-based smartphone. If one is to consider how previous Windows-powered smartphones fared in the market, it seems like there no is longer room for it, especially today with Google's Android and Apple iOS owning a huge chunk of the consumer market. Well, if the Windows-based mobile operating system does not do the trick, perhaps the hardware specifications and features will entice would-be buyers. Accordingly, the Microsoft Surface Phone is a monster on the inside, highlighted by 8 GB of random access memory (RAM) and 512 GB of internal storage, although there are differences expected since the device is rumored to be offered in three variants. The processor is speculated to be Intel's Kaby Lake, although it is still a long shot considering that even mainstream forthcoming laptops and notebooks aren't sure they'll get this highly anticipated chipset on time. Other notable features include the 20-megapixel Carl Zeiss rear camera, a fingerprint scanner, and an AMOLED screen display.

Rumor has it that Microsoft will unveil the Surface Pro 5 in January 2017 and release it in the market two months later. There's still no definitive date as to when the new Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will be coming to the market but if these slew of recent hints be of any indication, it could be deduced that the purported device might be hitting the shelves by next year. According to reports, the price of the current-gen Surface Pro 4 is expected to be slashed off in time for the most awaited Black Friday sale this year. In Amazon, the 256 GB with 8 GB of RAM with Core i5 processor now has a $1,076 price tag from its original of $1,299. The much higher tier, the 256 GB with 16 GB RAM, Core i7e processor, is selling at $1,498.99 instead of $1,799 while the 512 GB with 16 GB RAM, Core i7e processor is at $1,767.98 from $2,199. These are just some of the many deals being offered for the Surface Pro 4. As added by a report, these awesome discounts could be foretelling the Redmond-based tech giant's move to finally roll out the newest iterations of the Surface Pro line. Speaking of its delay, a publication pointed out the rumors saying that the coming of the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is being stalled because of the 14-nanometer Intel Kaby Lake processor. It's also speculated that Microsoft is looking to release the laptop tablet hybrid in time with the second major Windows 10 update – the Windows 10 Redstone 2 OS. There's no telling how much the alleged device would cost but several theories are banking on the U.S. $899 entry level price. A 4K UHD model is also speculated to bear a $1,599 sticker price. As of its release date, there are reports saying that Microsoft could be planning to release their newest offering at the same time Apple unveils their iPad Pro 2, which will be in the early 2017. Watch out for more updates.

MNR Daily HOME U.S. WORLD ENTERTAINMENT SCIENCE/HEALTH TECH LIFE Subscriptions Home TECH Microsoft Surface Book 2 release date news, specs rumor: New Surface Book emerges but it's not the Surface Book 2, according to sources Bryan Ke Nov 14, 2016 7:59 AM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (Microsoft/Surface)Official product render of the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 A lot of tech enthusiasts were quite thrilled when Microsoft announced a new Surface Book at its event late last month alongside the confirmation of the Surface Studio, the rumored all-in-one desktop from the tech giant. However, the new laptop from the Redmond-based manufacturer is actually just an upgrade from its original iteration and is not the much-awaited Microsoft Surface Book 2. According to The Verge, the upgraded Microsoft Surface Book laptop will only come with the same sixth-generation Skylake i7 processor from the original version that was released in October last year. Instead of a normal Hard Disk Drive, fans can now have a Solid State Drive (SSD) on the new laptop. Of course, the prices for it will differ depending on the size of storage as well as Random Access Memory (RAM) that fans will opt to have for the laptop. For starters, the cheapest laptop offered will come with a price tag of $2,399 for the 8 GB RAM and 256 GB SSD model. The second in the list is the model with 16 GB of RAM and 512 GB SSD for $2,799. Lastly, the most expensive among the three models is one with 16 GB RAM and 1 TB SSD, which can be bought for a whopping $3,299. As for the rumored Microsoft Surface Book 2, reports have it that it would sport an even greater System on Chip under its hood. It is said that the next-generation Surface Book will run using Intel's seventh-generation processor, which is referred to as Kaby Lake. In terms of its release date, there have been rumors saying that Microsoft might launch its Surface Book 2 flagship probably later in 2017. The reason for this is that the release of its upgraded Surface Book device may overshadow its potential sale. Unfortunately, the Redmond-based tech giant has yet to release any kind of hint pointing to the existence of the Microsoft Surface Book 2. With that in mind, fans are highly advised to take this information with a pinch of salt and consider it as mere speculation until proven otherwise.

Nov 14, 2016 07:43 AM EST | By Godswarrior010 email print Sign Up for GamenGuide's Newsletter and never miss out on our most popular stories. HP is announcing new notebooks at CES 2016, and its star is undoubtedly the EliteBook Folio G1. It’s a super-slim Windows laptop with a 4K touchscreen display that’s going to be in stores this March. (Photo: The Verge/YouTube) The HP EliteBook Folio G1 breaks the conventional mold of mobile laptops and brings many things in store for HP. The notebook unveiled in a CES conference just recently was patterned similarly to Apple's 12- inch MacBook. It also looks sleek and stylish but can it compete with the long-standing reputation of the MacBook Pro? Here's what we know. HP Elitebook Folio G1 Vs. MacBook Pro 2016: Specs HP EliteBook Folio G1 maybe a new kid on the block but it is a solid laptop that is thinner than the MacBook and is built with a silver aluminum chassis. It is slightly heavier than Apple's notebook but is lighter than some of the laptops within its range. Unlike MacBook Pro 2016's Intel Core i5 processor, HP is run by the latest Intel Core i7. The Apple notebook and Elitebook both has an 8 GB memory upgradeable to 16GB. The MacBook Pro 2016 comes along with an Intel Iris Graphics 540, 2,560 x 1,600 Retina display, 2 Thunderbolt 3 ports, a 3.55mm headphone jack and 256GB PCle SSD. HP Elitebook Folio on the other hand boasts of a 2,840 x 2,160 4k Touchscreen display, 2 USB-C Ports, 256GB PCle SSD, 8GB RAM and a full-HD non-touch display. As for the laptop's battery life, HP Elitebook Folio G1 lasts for seven hours while the MacBook Pro 2016 can be used for up to ten hours prior to charging. HP Elitebook Folio G1 Vs. MacBook Pro 2016: Price The Apple Notebook starts at the price of $1,799 while the lowest-end model of HP Elitebook Folio only comes in at $999. The HP Elitebook has 128GB of storage and a 1,920 X 1,080 pixel resolution non-touch display while MacBook has a bigger storage space of 256GB storage with 2,500 x 1,600 pixel resolution non-touch display.   HP Elitebook Folio G1 Vs. MacBook Pro 2016: The Verdict Like the MacBook Pro 2016, HP Elitebook uses Intel's latest Core M-series processors. Both the HP Elitebook Folio G1 and MacBook Pro 2016 are good choices for people looking for a slim, light, portable and powerful device. The two laptops have amazing specs and features that can lure anyone in. The only difference would be their price. HP Elitebook Folio is for those who want an outstanding laptop at an economical price while the MacBook Pro 2016 is for people can afford a superior laptop at a premium price. HP Elitebook Folio G1 is expected to be released on March 2017 while the MacBook Pro 2016 is readily available in Apple stores all over the world.        TagsHP Elitebook Folio G1, MacBook Pro 2016 Related Articles Microsoft Surface Pro 5 Release Date, Specs, Features & Price: Launch Date Confi ...

X.Org Foundation Moving Ahead With Becoming A Khronos Adopter For Mesa Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 14 November 2016 at 12:27 PM EST. 4 Comments While there were initially concerns by users over OpenGL 4.4~4.5 support being exposed for open-source Mesa drivers due to the Khronos OpenGL conformance test suite for these newer versions and the associated costs, those concerns were laid to rest and the X.Org Foundation is moving ahead with becoming an official Khronos adopter for Mesa. For the background to this matter and the clarifications about Khronos adoption by open-source software projects, it's all explained in this recent post: Khronos, Mesa, Standards & Conformance / Certification: Open Source, Open Standards. So if you are confused, go read that post. What's new to report on now is that at last week's X.Org Board of Directors meeting they agreed to move forward with becoming a "Khronos adopter" to cover the Mesa project. Details are still to be worked out, but per the meeting summary and the IRC logs, things are moving forward. This is of benefit to Mesa but especially for the Nouveau driver where it's all community-based and no formal backing by any major organization. Intel already has pursued OpenGL / OpenGL ES Khronos compliance by their drivers and AMD is also a Khronos member whereas the Nouveau development is mostly volunteer-focused without any access to the OpenGL CTS (Conformance Test Suite). 4 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience. Michael has written more than 10,000 articles covering the state of Linux hardware support, Linux performance, graphics drivers, and other topics.

Jamal Carnette (TMFJCar) Nov 14, 2016 at 10:16AM Microsoft's Zune is on the list. Image source: Flickr user Robert Nelson. Every successful company has a few products it would rather forget. Many remember New Coke, McDonald's Mighty Wings, Crystal Pepsi, Harley-Davidson cologne, Apple's Newton, and Ford's Edsel were among a few products that flopped while the companies went on to huge successes. For Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the company under former CEO Steve Ballmer has been characterized as the "lost decade" when the company missed out on the shift to mobile. It makes sense, then, that many of the failures I'll explore here occurred on his watch. Here are Microsoft's five biggest flops. Surface RT Microsoft's Surface tablets have been a recent success. In fact, the Surface has been so effective as a brand that the company has extended the name to laptops, with the Surface Book, and desktops, with the recently unveiled Surface Studio. Excluding Microsoft's Xbox, Microsoft's Surface line may be the company's first true hardware success. It's hard to imagine now, but the Surface tablet played a role in the departure of longtime CEO Steve Ballmer. The company's new Surface line (Surface Studio pictured) has been hardware success. Image source: Microsoft. During the initial rollout, Ballmer and Windows President Steven Sinofsky enthusiastically sold the Surface Pro. Unfortunately, the company introduced the lower-priced Surface RT as well. The RT version, although cheaper, never caught on with shoppers. The biggest issue was that the unit ran on ARM processors and wasn't backwards capable with Windows apps. The RT app store was very limited and led to a poor consumer experience. In a little over a year, both Sinofsky and Ballmer were gone and the company declared a $900 million writedown, primarily because of Surface RT sales. Windows Vista While many of Microsoft's flops came from when the company moved outside its competency of software, there have been more than a few times when Microsoft released substandard versions of its Windows OS. Many remember Windows 8 and the disappearing (then reappearing) Start button, or the crash-prone Windows ME the company replaced within a year. However, none of them were quite as bad as Windows Vista, which ended with a dismissed class action lawsuit. Released in early 2007, Windows Vista had as its primary goal to upgrade the operating system's security. Well, Microsoft overcorrected on the security front. Vista's prime criticism was that the company's prompt-prone user-access control function was an extreme annoyance. Additionally, the rollout was extremely problematic, with ominous hardware and licensing requirements affecting a large portion of users. Later, Microsoft received a black eye when leaked emails from company execs surfaced in the class action lawsuit, revealing that the company lowered the requirements for incompatible Intel chips to help its primary chipmaker make quarterly earnings estimates. Zune Perhaps the failure of Ballmer could best be encapsulated by the company's Zune. Microsoft launched its first-gen Zune device in 2006, a full half-decade after Apple released its iPod. After poor reception for the device, Microsoft released its last version, the Zune HD, in late 2009. The company discontinued its support for Zune devices in 2015. The failure of Zune was not simply hardware related. By its release, Apple had become the de facto gatekeeper for digital downloads, a distinction the company owns to this day. However, the iPod provided Cupertino the prototype for mobile dominance, as the company was, unbeknownst to Microsoft, heavily at work on the iPhone. Microsoft Phone If Zune represented a falling behind of Microsoft's mobile fortunes, Windows Phone has cemented Microsoft's mobile fortunes. Originally, the company decided to work with hardware partners, much as it does with its Microsoft OS, and merely provide the ecosystem. However, after a poor response from most hardware partners, Ballmer's Microsoft purchased the only strong ally by buying Nokia's phone business for $7.2 billion in 2014. Image source: Microsoft. Last year, Microsoft announced its plans to cut 7,800 jobs in the division and write down roughly $7.6 billion owing to its Nokia business. Additionally, the company sold the feature (non-smart) phone business to Chinese assembler Foxconn for $350 million. While the rumored high-end Surface smartphone keeps getting bandied about, but never confirmed, it's safe to say Microsoft's foray into smartphones is a costly bust thus far. Adding insult to injury, Ballmer initially reacted about the iPhone's release with a laughing shrug. aQuantive In an attempt to compete with Google in the digital advertising space, Microsoft paid $6.3 billion to buy display-ad company aQuantive. Microsoft seemed quite assured of the company's value by inking the deal with an 85% acquisition premium and by consummating the offer in cash. After five years and $10.4 billion in ongoing online services losses, Microsoft took a $6.2 billion write-off on the acquisition. Many reasons were blamed for the failure -- Microsoft's insistence that aQuantive move into search to augment its Bing search engine, a culture-clash between the two companies, and brain drain among aQuantive staff hurting innovation -- but in the end, Microsoft lost out on the search and display business to its nimbler competitor.     Jamal Carnette owns shares of Apple.

Possible enhancements such as increasing the bandwidth while simultaneously reducing the size, weight, power, and cost of the device have yet to be developed. Beyond this, Cognitive Radio represents the next major advance in wireless technology, holding out the tantalizing promise of significantly greater spectrum utilization, however, there are some significant barriers which still must be surmounted. Software Defined Radio (SDR) Software Defined Radio has evolved over the last decade to become the latest generation of wireless technology for the modern war fighter. This has been spurred by innovations in programmable hardware that have allowed unprecedented sophistication in software. Hardware advances in both the logic and RF domains have enabled the creation of radios with far greater capabilities in much smaller form factors. For example, the capacities and additional features built into FPGAs have grown exponentially. Today it is possible to design using a 20nm device from Intel (formerly Altera) boasting up to 660k logic elements, 39 Mbits of on-chip memory, over 3,300 DSP blocks, 48 serial transceivers each capable of 17.4 Gbps, and dual 32-bit ARM processor cores clocking at 1.5 GHz. These offer baseband processing far in excess of what was feasible even a few years ago. Click here to read more ...

Blog Next-Gen Programmable, Cognitive Military Radio Systems Paul Dillien, Principal, High Tech Marketing 11/14/2016 00:00 AM EST  0 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet Cognitive radio is the next major advance in wireless technology, holding out the tantalizing promise of significantly greater spectrum use. With the technological challenges surrounding software-defined radio (SDR) largely overcome, the deployment of first generation sets is underway. Possible enhancements such as increasing the bandwidth while simultaneously reducing the size, weight, power, and cost of the device have yet to be developed. Beyond this, cognitive radio represents the next major advance in wireless technology, holding out the tantalizing promise of significantly greater spectrum utilization, however, there are some significant barriers which still must be surmounted. Software-defined radio has evolved over the last decade to become the latest generation of wireless technology for the modern war fighter. This has been spurred by innovations in programmable hardware that have allowed unprecedented sophistication in software. Hardware advances in both the logic and RF domains have enabled the creation of radios with far greater capabilities in much smaller form factors. For example, the capacities and additional features built into FPGAs have grown exponentially. Today it is possible to design using a 20nm device from Intel (formerly Altera) boasting up to 660k logic elements, 39 Mbits of on-chip memory, over 3,300 DSP blocks, 48 serial transceivers each capable of 17.4 Gbps, and dual 32-bit ARM processor cores clocking at 1.5 GHz. These offer baseband processing far in excess of what was feasible even a few years ago. Similarly, field-programmable RF (FPRF) devices have become far more capable. The first generation FPRF from Lime Microsystems broke all the barriers for integration when it was launched. It offers a complete transceiver integrating RF amplifiers, filters, mixers, and gain blocks, along with low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) and data converters. The resultant single chip enables highly capable SDR sets to be produced with superior size, weight, power, and cost, commonly abbreviated to SWaP-C. Today, by combining a second-generation low power FPRF (LMS7002M) with the newly-released Up/Down RF frequency shifter devices, designers have unsurpassed RF capabilities at their disposal. The FPRF device features dual transceivers and the chip has field programmable DSP blocks and received signal strength indicators (RSSIs) to bolster the performance while at the same time reducing the power consumption. FPRFs intrinsically cover the frequency range 100 kHz to 3.8 GHz, which encompasses a multitude of bands used by air, sea, and ground forces. The ability, in a single chip, to support such a range of frequencies makes it a very capable device for SDR applications.

Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today Many tech enthusiasts tuned in to last October's Apple hardware event to get the latest updates on the MacBook products. Specifically, the public was interested to see the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air refresh. The Apple fans were delighted to see the new and powerful MacBook Pro 2016, although many were also disappointed when the Cupertino-based tech giant made no mention of a refreshed MacBook Air laptop. Still, the Mac Air followers are still hopeful that Apple will still update the Air series. Although there are no clear signs from Apple, the rumors are rife that the all-new MacBook Air will arrive sometime next year. According to Game N Guide, the MacBook Air 2017 will be unveiled by Apple during the company's March hardware event. Apple recently picked up the habit of having a hardware event in March, starting with this year when they showcased the iPad Pro and iPhone SE. It is possible that Apple will also hold the first hardware event next year in March, this time to showcase the new MacBook Air. One of the possible major improvements of the MacBook Air 2017 is the replacement of USB-A ports. The MacBook Air has not been updated for a long time, so it is likely that the 2017 Mac Air will go straight to the latest USB-C ports, Mac Rumors reported. It is also expected to sport a Touch ID, as well as fingerprint sensor on its screen display for better security features. It will also sport an Apple Pencil-enabled Track Pad, although what's actually interesting is the arrival of Apple's famous virtual assistant Siri in MacBook. There are other rumors suggesting that the upcoming Mac Air will be powered by the present Intel Skylake chipset, although there is a possibility that it will be among the first devices to boast the next generation Intel Kaby Lake processor. There are still more details to confirm whether the 2017 MacBook Air will come into fruition or not. Some people are suggesting that the recently released thin air MacBook Pro is already a sign that Apple will no longer release a new Air laptop, permanently replacing the current MacBook Air model. However, the public is advised to take these early rumors with a grain of salt until Apple releases an official announcement.

By Mary-Ann Russon November 14, 2016 14:47 GMT Researchers have worked out how to steal your passwords, PINs and pattern-lock swipes by analysing Wi-Fi signals to see how your fingers move on a smartphone screeniStock US and Chinese security researchers have discovered that it is possible to detect a user's private information by studying the radio signals emitted to provide Wi-Fi internet coverage and how they interact with a person's body movements. Researchers from Shanghai Jaio Tong University, the University of Massachusetts Boston and the University of South Florida have developed the WindTalker system, which can analyse sophisticated contemporary Wi-Fi networks and sneakily detect and record passwords by looking at the directions that radio waves travel to provide wireless internet coverage. Older wireless routers only had one antenna to broadcast Wi-Fi signals around your home, but the latest internet routers now come with multiple antennas and a technology called Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MIMO), which enables routers to connect and transmit data from multiple devices simultaneously. MIMO works by transmitting radio signals in different directions at particular angles in order to better detect where the devices connecting to the internet are located in a room. The antenna makes small changes every now and then to strengthen radio signals going in some directions, while signals going in other directions are cancelled out. Because the routers are designed to detect and manage very small changes to the radio signals in order to make sure that your devices, computers, smart TVs and game consoles are always receiving the best-quality signal, the same technology can be exploited to track your hand as it swipes and types away on your smartphone screen. Thanks to this ability of being able to triangulate a target using radio signals, Wi-Fi has previously been proven by MIT to work as 'X-ray vision', sensing and tracking a person's exact position through a wall. Tracking how your fingers move on a smartphone screen So when you swipe your Android smartphone lock-screen pattern, enter a PIN number or a password in an app, your finger movements alter the radio signal and the movements are imprinted into the signal, meaning that if hackers were controlling a public Wi-Fi access point that your device is connected to, they could then reverse-engineer the signal to figure out what sensitive data you may have typed into your phone. The researchers set up a malicious public Wi-Fi access point consisting of $20 (£16) antennas, the attacker's laptop and a $5 Intel networking card in a café. The setup was located a metre away from a target sitting at a table with a smartphone. Once the user connected to the free Wi-Fi, the WindTalker system was able to extract sensitive data by analysing the radio signals and processing the signals to separate the parts of the signal it needed. WindTalker was able to accurately spy on and detect the six-digit passwords commonly used by banks and payment apps with an accuracy rate of 68.3%, that quickly rose to 81.7% once they provided their system with enough training examples for specific smartphone models. The study, entitled When CSI Meets Public WiFi: Inferring Your Mobile Phone Password via WiFi Signals, is published in the Association of Computing Machinery's Proceedings of the 2016 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security that was held in Vienna, Austria, from 24-28 October.

They all have thinner bodies, better screens, and trackpads so big they blot out the sun. And you can buy it in space gray. But the important addition is the Touch Bar. This capacitive strip of OLED glass above the keyboard is supposed to change everything, again, about how you use your laptop. recommends 2016 Apple MacBook Pro With Touch Bar 8/10 Learn How We Rate Wired Thinner, lighter, prettier. There's no such thing as a too-big trackpad. The Touch Bar is remarkably well-executed. The ability to charge from any port is pretty great. Tired The world is not quite ready for USB-C, and you're not either. The Touch Bar needs more customization, and soon. Laptops aren't supposed to be this expensive, are they? Buy It Now   |  Apple How We Rate 1/10A complete failure in every way 2/10Sad, really 3/10Serious flaws; proceed with caution 4/10Downsides outweigh upsides 5/10Recommended with reservations 6/10Solid with some issues 7/10Very good, but not quite great 8/10Excellent, with room to kvetch 9/10Nearly flawless 10/10Metaphysical perfection “For 25 years,” Tim Cook said while unveiling the device, “we’ve been defining and redefining what a notebook is and what it can do.” Dramatic pause. “And today, we’re going to do it again.” Of course, Apple expects you to pay up: the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar starts at $1,800. It’s been several years since the last big MacBook update, and mine is, like yours, long in the tooth. I’d been waiting for a reason to buy a new one, and jumped at the chance to try the new Pro. This is supposed to be it! The laptop of the future, and the future of the laptop. After using it, poking and prodding it, and plugging things into it, I have one word of advice. Wait. Can Touch This People love Apple computers because Apple gets the basics right. The keyboard, the trackpad, the screen, the speakers, all the table-stakes things too many companies get wrong. And in most cases, Apple made the best even better with the new MacBook Pro. Apple’s Touch Bar doesn’t quite count as a revolutionary overhaul, but it’s certainly the biggest change Apple’s made in years. The trackpad doesn’t physically click, but feels like it does, and it is so big and smooth you’d be crazy to use a mouse. The keyboard (a refined take on the 12-inch MacBook’s butterfly keys) doesn’t have much travel and takes getting used to, but it’s accurate and crisp and works beautifully. The speakers are louder and clearer than ever. I get eight or nine hours from the battery, as long as I’m not Photoshopping all day and keep the brightness below eye-bleeding levels. And the screen is, well, the screen is ridiculous. Apple’s ultra-wide color gamut, on top of the super-high resolution, makes it the best laptop display I’ve ever seen. The 13-inch Pro, which I’ve been using, is a bit over half an inch thick and weighs almost exactly three pounds. I carried a MacBook Air for years, and this feels like that. (The footprint is actually a bit smaller.) Everything about it, even the charger, is smaller than ever. Apple could have kept the body the same and added more battery, or more power, but opted for smaller and lighter. How you feel about that says a lot about whether you’ll like the new Pro. Apple’s Touch Bar doesn’t quite count as revolutionary, but it’s the biggest change in years. The thin OLED strip, where the function keys used to be, knows which app you’re in, tries to guess which features or settings you might need, and puts them within reach (barely) of your fingertips. In Safari, the Touch Bar offers small indicators for each tab and bookmark, plus quick access for search and opening a tab. In Messages, it becomes the Emoji Bar, which is objectively the best thing ever. You can scrub through your timeline in Final Cut, or swipe through photo albums in Photos. There’s no new functionality here, just easier and more obvious access to common stuff. Technically, the Touch Bar works brilliantly. It’s fast and smooth and responsive. The textured glass feels great, and looks fantastic. Using my fingerprint on the Touch ID reader to log in and to pay for stuff is the best. But the implementation feels unfinished. With no function keys, shortcuts for adjusting brightness and controlling music are hidden in a tiny menu to the right of the Touch Bar. Three are accessible at a tap: mute, volume, and screen brightness. (What madman needs brightness controls that much?) Pausing or playing music—something I do about 45,000 times daily—requires carefully tapping on the tiny left arrow, waiting a moment for the menu to expand, then finding and pressing the button. “It takes a heartbeat longer to pause my music” hardly qualifies as a burn-it-down kind of problem. But the Touch Bar exists precisely to make these small, repetitive tasks easier. And too often, it just doesn’t have the option or button I’m looking for. The screen changes constantly, moving things around to the point where I can’t find anything. I’d like to see Apple open the Touch Bar so users can customize it. Then it could be everything I want it to be, because I could make it so. Right now, I’m subject to Apple’s best guess about what I want. Apple often guesses wrong. Pros, and Cons The entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar costs $1,799. It has a 2.9GHz Core i5 processor, 256 gigs of solid-state storage, eight gigs of RAM, and Intel Iris 550 graphics. Most benchmarks show that it’s faster than the previous Pro without being preposterously so. Now, if you don’t know or care what any of that means, it’s probably way more computer than you need. So is the 12-inch MacBook, honestly. That’s probably a better machine, if you don’t need more than a browser. More MacBook Brian Barrett Missing the MagSafe Charger in the New MacBook? Here’s Your Dongle Brian Barrett The MacBook Pro’s Most Important New Feature? Touch ID David Pierce Hands On: The New MacBook Pro Is a Whole New Kind of Laptop Brian Barrett Apple’s New MacBook Pro Has a ‘Touch Bar’ on the Keyboard If you’re a spec-hungry power-user, you might be underwhelmed. You might not like that Apple called this MacBook “Pro” and made it even more expensive while using an old version of Intel’s processors, something less than the fastest graphics cards, and limited it to 16 gigs of RAM, max, on the super-high-end, $4,200 15-inch model. You definitely won’t like that Apple ditched every one of its previous ports in favor of Thunderbolt 3 ports jacks that require spending between $20 and $2 billion on adapters. In my experience, there’s plenty of power here. My workflow isn’t everyone’s, but I can run Photoshop, Photos, 25 browser tabs, Slack (which is weirdly power-hungry at times), and a handful of other apps, no sweat. It’s not enough for high-end gaming, or really intensive video editing, but it’s more than enough for everyone else. But the ports. Apple. WTF? I can conclusively say The Dongle Life sucks. It’s great that my laptop is smaller and lighter, but hunting through my bag for the tiny adapter to plug in my hard drive, which is different from the one I need for my monitor, which won’t work to plug in my phone, is infuriating exercise. Lots of people don’t connect things to their laptops, but those people aren’t the people who need a MacBook Pro. Pro users need RAID arrays, and second displays, and Ethernet connections. Apple’s response, as with so many things, is: We know better than you do, so give it a minute. USB-C is here, or at least coming quickly, and you need to get on board. If you don’t buy a USB-C computer now because you don’t want adapters, you’ll be buying adapters in a couple years to connect your new stuff to your legacy computer. Everyone complains, but figures it out. There’s no better way to kickstart the ecosystem than to put the new world order in front of the pros who will build it. All of that is true. But it won’t help you connect your SD card. Begin Upgrade Do you desperately need a new laptop right this second? If not, wait. Run your current (and probably still excellent) machine into the ground, then buy a new one. In a year or two USB-C accessories will be everywhere, developers will have figured out what the Touch Bar is good for, and Apple may even give the Pro spec bump. If you are in the market, though, consider your next purchase an investment and buy something this powerful, this nice, and this future-proof. Most people won’t need more oomph until we’re all living in VR, Ready Player One-style. Your best bet may be a MacBook Pro. Or, you could spend a lot less on a Dell XPS 13, HP Spectre 13, or Microsoft Surface Book, all of which are similarly great. The new MacBook Pro is a terrific laptop and, like the super-skinny MacBook, a clear indication of where most of the computing world is going. But comes with growing pains while your workflow and other devices adjust to a new way of doing things. I can eke another nine months or so out of my old Pro before springing for the upgrade. You probably can too. But we all need to start getting ready for the one-port, no-wires, un-repairable future now, because it’s coming. Go Back to Top.

 REVIEW: The new MacBook Pro is the best laptop you can buy Steve Kovach Nov. 14, 2016, 8:00 AM 10,454 facebook linkedin twitter email print The new MacBook Pro.Hollis Johnson/Business Insider The new MacBook Pro has been a long time coming. It's been over four years since its last significant update. In the meantime, we've seen a bunch of impressive new takes on pro-level hardware, especially the Surface Book from Microsoft. Apple was past due for something new. The latest MacBook Pro model is slimmer, more powerful, and downright attractive. But the real story is the impressive new Touch Bar, a touch screen at the top of the keyboard that replaces the traditional function keys in favor of digital keys that change depending on the app you're using. The computer isn't without controversy either. Apple eliminated the standard ports professionals love on the MacBook Pro in favor of a new kind of port called Thunderbolt 3 that does everything from charging to connecting to external displays. The backlash among the pro community has been pretty loud in the weeks since the MacBook Pro's debut, forcing Apple to make a major concession by temporarily slashing the cost of accessories. Most of all, the MacBook Pro represents a major shift computers are going through right now, from a smattering of different plugs to a new universal standard called USB-C that'll soon be on most electronics. It's not going to be an easy transition, but it's happening. The new MacBook Pro is available now, starting at $1,499 for the model without the Touch Bar and $1,799 for the model with the Touch Bar. There's also a 15-inch model with Touch Bar that starts at $2,399. It's the best MacBook you can buy, but it's also not for everyone. The Touch Bar Let's begin with the Touch Bar, since that's the hallmark feature of the MacBook Pro. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider The Touch Bar has a unique design that's cleverly executed. This isn't a bright, glowing screen like the one on your iPhone. Instead, Apple gave the glass strip a matte finish that blends right into the laptop's physical keys. The digital function keys (and emojis!) look as if they were painted on the surface. The photos don't do it justice. It really is impressive in person. In addition to all the standard function keys like volume control and screen brightness, there's a dedicated button that activates Siri and plenty of room to add your own customized function keys for the stuff you do the most. But the real benefit comes from the Touch Bar's intelligence — it adapts to whatever app you're using. It works with all of the Apple apps that ship with the MacBook, plus a few third-party apps like Photoshop and Microsoft Office. Other app makers just got their hands on the tools they need to make their programs compatible with the Touch Bar, so expect even more support soon. There are loads of examples of what the Touch Bar can do, so I thought it'd be best to break down some of my favorites: Photos Hollis Johnson/Business Insider The Touch Bar lets you scrub through your photo library in chronological order. It also has a set of editing tools when you select a photo. It definitely improves the experience when tweaking your photos. Safari Hollis Johnson/Business Insider Your bookmarks appear in the Touch Bar, so you just have to tap to launch one of your favorite sites. It's also a lot easier to launch a new tab or window. (This was my favorite use for the Touch Bar.) Another cool feature: When you're watching a web video, the Touch Bar brings up controls so you can play/pause or scrub through the video. iMessage Hollis Johnson/Business Insider At last, Apple has invented the emoji keyboard you've always wanted on a laptop. (Yes, I'm being facetious, but how often have you wished for an easier way to type emojis?) When typing an iMessage, you can tap the emoji button to bring up a row of emojis that you can swipe through, just like on your iPhone. Mail Hollis Johnson/Business Insider When you're typing an email address in the "To" field, the Touch Bar suggests other addresses you might want to add to the thread based on people you commonly email. This is my favorite feature with the Touch Bar in Mail. There are also a bunch of text formatting options, which you'll find in other word processing apps as well. Touch ID Hollis Johnson/Business Insider Apple added its Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the MacBook for the first time. It sits at the right end of the Touch Bar and doubles as the computer's power button. Touch ID lets you log into your MacBook without typing your password, and it can be programmed for multiple user accounts. It also works with Apple Pay purchases on supported sites if you use the Safari browser. That's not even close to a comprehensive list of everything the Touch Bar does, but hopefully it gives you a good taste of what you're in for. The best part about it is how it automatically changes and adapts to what you're working on. Only a few things don't make sense on the Touch Bar. For example, there's a word suggestion feature while typing, similar to what you see on your iPhone. It simply doesn't make sense on a laptop though. You're already looking at your laptop screen while you type, so it seems counterintuitive to expect users to stare at the Touch Bar and tap on the words it suggests. The only benefit I see here is that it makes a decent real-time spell-checker. Is the Touch Bar worth the extra price? Does it fundamentally change the way you use the MacBook? For some, maybe. For me, it was nice to have, but not essential. The Touch Bar is clever and well executed, but it's not something you absolutely need. Luckily, you can buy a version of the MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar and still enjoy many of the other benefits the computer offers while saving $300. Design and performance Hollis Johnson/Business Insider The MacBook Pro is significantly slimmed down. The 13-inch model is now about the same size and weight as the MacBook Air, but with a lot more power and that beautiful high-resolution Retina display. The Pro takes a lot of its design cues from the "regular" MacBook, that superthin model that launched last year. It even has a similar keyboard, with keys that don't travel as much and are almost flush with the surface. It takes some getting used to, but I love typing on it. (Apple improved the keyboard on the MacBook Pro to feel like the keys press in more than they actually do.) It also comes in space gray or the classic silver color, but space gray is the one that stands out. As far as I'm concerned, it's the only color you should choose. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider I won't get into too many technical details about the internal specs, but overall the MacBook Pro is a powerful machine, running the latest processors from Intel. The 15-inch model has some impressive graphics capabilities too. However, as my colleague Tony Villas-Boas pointed out a few weeks ago, plenty of Windows laptops have just as much or more power and cost a lot less than the MacBook Pro. Ports and dongles Welcome to the future. The Thunderbolt 3 ports.Hollis Johnson/Business Insider The MacBook Pro doesn't have any of the traditional ports you'd expect, except for a standard headphone jack. That means no USB, no HDMI, no SD card reader. Instead, you have Thunderbolt 3, the new port that's also compatible with the new USB-C standard. But Thunderbolt can do it all. It runs 5K external displays and connects to any other external accessory. It's also used for charging the MacBook, which is a disappointing move since Apple ditched its clever MagSafe plug in favor of Thunderbolt. The upside is battery life on the MacBook is much better, so you likely won't need to charge it during the day. Apple says you'll get up to 10 hours per charge, but I didn't get that close. It was more like eight hours — although I tend to keep my screen brighter than most people. You'll need a new USB-C cable just to charge your iPhone.Hollis Johnson/Business Insider Thunderbolt 3 is a blessing and a curse. It's great to have one port for everything, but as the industry transitions to USB-C, you're going to find yourself using a lot of new kinds of cables, adapters, and dongles to get your old accessories to work with the new MacBook Pro. It's disappointing Apple didn't include at least one adapter with the computer like it did with the iPhone 7 to help everyone transition to the lack of headphone jack. Apple has a long history of killing legacy inputs and pushing the industry toward its vision. So far, it's worked every time. It killed the floppy disk drive, DVD drive, Ethernet port, and more. Now it has abandoned everything but Thunderbolt/USB-C. For better or for worse, you have no choice but to get used to it. Few dispute that USB-C is the future, but it's going to be a messy transition for the next few years. A 'prosumer' computer I'm not a graphics artist. I'm not a video editor. I'm not an app developer. I'm a writer, and my computer use is pretty simple. I browse the web, manage my photos, send emails, and, of course, write. For me, the MacBook Pro has been a dream. The design, sharp screen, and extra power makes my two-year-old MacBook Air feel ancient. But I can also understand the qualms people in the professional community have with the MacBook Pro. I spoke to a photographer friend of mine who said the lack of an SD card reader is a deal breaker for many in his line of work. The fact that you can only get up to 16 GB of RAM is another sore spot for many. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider I hate using this word, but I see the MacBook Pro as more of a "prosumer" device, at least until we see more adoption of USB-C and Apple allows you to add more memory. It's easily the best laptop for someone who favors design and power and doesn't mind dropping $1,800 or more. However, I can also understand why so many in the pro community feel as though Apple left them out. That said, most people don't have those expectations, and they'll love the MacBook Pro. I definitely did. (I'm this close to pulling the trigger and buying one myself.) It's the best laptop you can buy.

(Moshe Shai/Flash90) YERUSHALAYIM - Is it possible that Israel will be weaned off gasoline and switched to alternative energy? More than 2,200 participants, among them leading automobile manufacturers and energy companies, scientists and policy makers from more than 30 countries, participated in the prime minister’s conference for fuel alternatives and smart transportation, which took place for the fourth year in Tel Aviv last week. At the conference, Israel’s position as a leader in the area of alternative fuels and smart transportation was touted, proven by a peak interest in technology and Israeli initiatives in the field by international entities. Eyal Rosner, head of the alternative fuel administration in the Prime Minister’s Office, said that “there is peak interest by automobile and energy companies in Israel and this event was a platform to expand ties between Israeli and international companies.” The conference included a special panel on autonomous vehicles, with a presentation by executives of BMW and Mobileye appearing for the first time together since the companies announced the development of an autonomous vehicle in cooperation with Intel. During the conference, a prototype of the FIAT 500-M15 was also presented. It was developed jointly by Fiat and Chrysler, Dor Chemicals and the national program for alternative fuels. The car can run on all kinds of liquid fuel, such as methanol, made from natural gas, which may be the first liquid gasoline produced in Israel.   Filed under: Gas Print Email Gmail Related Israel Moves Forward on Smart Transportation Netanyahu Invites Russian Gas Companies to Israel Gasoline’s Drag on Household Income Hit 30-Year High in 2012 Average U.S. Gasoline Pice Falls Below $2 for First Time Since 2009 Israel Undeterred by Kuwaiti Boycott of Mideast Energy Conference Subscribe to the Hamodia print edition More in Israel Israel to Look for More Dead Sea Scrolls Rabbi Litzman Raises Objection to Muezzin Bill Histadrut on Strike Path Over Long-Term Care Insurance Liberman Warns Against Clash With Army at Amona El Al Publicly Rebukes Pilots in Sick-Call Squabble OP-ED Where Do We Go From Here?

That is a multi-trillion-dollar question. The man is notoriously hard to read, and he likes it that way. As a keen dealmaker, he favors "unpredictability," which is smart game theory. Any administration, even a Trump administration, needs to focus on a handful of priorities that it pushes and tries to get through Congress in the first 100 days in office. But Trump has made many promises, some implausible, some contradicted by later promises, and almost all of them poorly fleshed out. What's going to be the main policy focus of the upcoming Trump administration? Here are some hopeful possibilities: 1. Enforce America's immigration laws. Implement a points-based system. The United States has for decades pursued a formidably hypocritical policy of open borders in practice and regulation. In my heart of hearts, I still believe that illegal immigrants who have been peacefully in the country for a long time and want to assimilate should be granted amnesty. But it's also the case that, as President Obama reminded the nation after Trump's election, the rule of law is a cardinal value in a democracy, and any democratic nation has the right to decide and enforce its own immigration laws. Too many of the American people — not just Trump voters, but Bernie Sanders voters and Democratic voters who stayed home — believe that their elites have failed them and don't control the country anymore. Actually showing that securing the border and enforcing immigration laws is feasible would go a long way towards restoring citizens' faith in government. This most definitely does not mean sending millions of people away. But stepping up enforcement just a bit, particularly on businesses, would be enough to push many more illegal immigrants to "self-deport." In parallel, Trump should push for a legal immigration system the likes of which even restrictionists agree on, which is an Australia- or Canada-style points-based immigration system, one that still protects refugees after "extreme vetting." And what about the infamous wall? President Trump should start by suspending NAFTA. Then Mexico will come to the table. 2. Enact smart tax reforms. Trump's tax plan is a disaster. It's also anathema to everything that Trump has campaigned on. It represents the worst part of the typical Republican agenda, with its solicitousness toward the rich and business elites. It's frankly quite strange that Trump's official tax plan includes a tax cut so massive, particularly on the rich, that it makes even many committed supply-siders blanch. Don't get me wrong. Tax cuts are awesome! But Trump should definitely keep higher income tax rates where they are. He should also punish coastal DINKs by capping the mortgage interest deduction or turn it into a flat credit. Trump should get rid of the state income tax deduction (which would push blue states to live within their means), raise the rate on short-term capital gains, get rid of the carried interest loophole (which favors private equity and hedge fund barons), and get a nice, big, fat child tax credit refundable against payroll taxes. Turning an expanded EITC into a wage subsidy program would also Make America Great Again by encouraging working-class employment. 3. Introduce pro-family policy. The smartest and best thing Trump did during his campaign was to come out forcefully for pro-family policy. Recall that his policy involved deductibility of childcare expenses from income taxes — a child tax credit will accomplish what that measure seeks to accomplish in a way that favors working-class families more — and mandatory paid maternity leave, paid for by the government. That last measure should be a non-negotiable point in the first bill relating to economic or social policy that Trump signs. 4. Focus on infrastructure. It's heartening that this is the only policy item that Trump mentioned in his acceptance speech. After a round of Obama stimulus spending that delivered a lot less than advertised, it's important to get this right. Infrastructure can provide a short-term boost to the economy, but more importantly, infrastructure is a key component in global competitiveness and attracting manufacturing jobs, a topic at the heart of the Trump agenda. I wrote previously that an infrastructure plan should focus on high-speed internet, nuclear power, and ambitious projects like the Hyperloop. I would add an additional point: Companies contracted to do infrastructure work should get bonuses if they hire long-term unemployed workers who have earned a qualification at the end of the contract. Those companies should also get a waiver from laws against hiring people with a prison record. 5. Rein in China. There's no need to start an outright trade war. But it is actually the case that China has been ripping us off. Although the situation has recently improved, China has eroded the West's industrial base by artificially deflating its currency. Chinese exporters get an incredible raft of explicit and implicit government subsidies that have no equivalent in their trading partners. Foreign investment in China is highly restricted. The outright theft of intellectual property by Western companies' Chinese "partners" is rampant and it is an open secret that this is something the Chinese government encourages. This is not "free trade." But it's rich material for negotiations and potential WTO actions, in the spirit of "win-win cooperation" that Chinese President Xi Jinping called for upon Trump's election. The Trump administration should actively explore former Intel CEO Andy Grove's proposal for a tax on offshored labor used to fund a bank that would support American companies, if only as a negotiating chip. In the meantime, there is a very easy way for the American government to stimulate the American economy and make American exporters more competitive: monetary expansion. Trump shouldn't start a trade war, but he should definitely start a monetary war. 6. Help inner cities. Trump spent more of his campaign than recent Republican nominees talking about the plight of inner cities, if in that Trumpian way of his. This is an opportunity to do some good and unveil an agenda for those communities populated by the forgotten Americans that now have Trump as their champion, even if they overwhelmingly voted against him. These communities need, first of all, the rule of law. This means no abusive cops, but also no crime. Even though progressive activists keep trying to retcon tough-on-crime policies as the Klan in all-but name, historically, many of these measures, including broken windows policies, were supported by black Americans and welcomed by the black community, which, in many cases, bears the brunt of inner-city crime. Intelligent reforms to policing should be paired with more cops on the beat. Making America Great Again also obviously involves economic renewal, which is why Trump should dust off an old Republican idea: designating economically depressed areas as special economic zones, with extremely low taxes, particularly on work, and with a light-touch regulation regime, especially with regard to rules on hiring former felons and, most of all, occupational licensing. It's almost certain that Trump will get absolutely no political credit from his ideological enemies for a program like this. But in some ways, that's why it should be done.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Nintendo Switch pricing leaked by Toys’R’Us JC Torres - Nov 14, 2016 8 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Another piece of the Nintendo Switch puzzle may have just been unwittingly revealed by toy retail giant Toys’R’Us. Although many parts of the hybrid handheld console remains a mystery, one of the most important question is its price. And that has been kindly provided by the company’s Canadian website. The good news is that it isn’t as high as current gen consoles, like the PS4, Xbox One, or even the soon retired Wii U. The bad news is that the price might actually be a reflection of what the console’s hardware is capable of. The idea of a gaming console that you can take anywhere with you, without being limited to handheld titles, is definitely mouth-watering to any avid gamer. That is practically the promise that the Nintendo Switch is making, at least when it lands next year. Expectations, however, need to be tempered with reality and technical limitations, especially given some recent revelations and leaks about the device. NVIDIA was only too happy to boast that it’s chip drives both general and graphics processing of the console. After all, it is finally its chance to join the fray, with AMD running inside both the Sony PlayStation 4 and the Microsoft Xbox One. However, given the form it takes, it is NVIDIA’s mobile Tegra processor that is inside. Not a GeForce plus Intel CPU. A Tegra. The very same line of processors found inside Android tablets. In fact, parallels are being drawn between the Nintendo Switch and the NVIDIA SHIELD, though the former will definitely boast of higher specs. In short, as far as hardware is concerned, the Switch might actually be a customized tablet running a customized Nintendo OS. Which is probably a good thing if it means it will have a multi-touch screen as well. As for that price, Toys’R’Us Canada puts it at 329.99 CAD, which is roughly $245. That is about the price of a mid to high end Android tablet as well. Naturally, no mention of shipping date, but Nintendo itself promises to provide that information early next year.

Samsung and TSMC will describe 7nm SRAMs, Mediatek will show a 10nm SoC and STMicroelectronics will unveil a neural network accelerator made in a fully depleted silicon-on-insulator process. At a time when progress in traditional chip scaling is slowing down, two keynotes at ISSCC will explore emerging ways to advance semiconductors with chip stacks, novel circuit designs and new materials. The keynotes will be given by a vice president of R&D at TSMC and the chief technology officer of Texas Instruments, Separately, researchers will give keynote talks on the state of two emerging technologies expected to have broad impact -- DNA sequencing and quantum computing. The annual event will gather about 3,000 engineers in February to share state-of-the-art work across a wide range of logic and memory chips. In general-purpose processors, AMD will give an in-depth look at its upcoming Zen x86 core, and Intel will detail its Altera Stratix 10 FPGA. In memories, Samsung and a team of Western Digital and Toshiba will show competing 512 Gbit 3-D NAND flash chips. In a sign of the status of the underlying process technology, TSMC will unveil what organizers called “the smallest SRAM bit cell published to date.” The 0.027mm2 256 Mbit SRAM is made in a 7nm FinFET process using write-assist circuitry for low Vmin applications. The Taiwan foundry’s rival, Samsung, will not be far behind with a 7nm FinFET SRAM less than 0.030mm2 in area. Interestingly, the part is made using extreme ultraviolet lithography for peripheral repair analysis, an approach said to improve Vmin by 39.9 mV based on failure analysis. Samsung announced earlier this year it plans to put EUV steppers into production earlier than rivals, in part because it is testing them in both logic and memory fabs. TSMC has said it will wait for 5nm before inserting EUV.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 13, 2016 at 11:28AM The global cybersecurity market could grow from $122.45 billion today to $202.36 billion by 2021, according to a new report from Research and Markets. The firm believes that growth will be driven by an increase of connected objects across the Internet of Things, relaxed BYOD (bring your own device) policies at work, and the need for tighter application security. Image source: Getty Images. It also estimates that the banking, financial services, and insurance market vertical will experience the highest growth due to the rising adoption of web and mobile apps, and that the Asia Pacific region will experience the highest growth as growing markets like China and India deploy more cybersecurity solutions. That forecast sounds bullish, but investors should also examine these four other stats to understand how rapidly the cybersecurity market could grow within the next few years. Stat number one Nearly 178 million personal records were exposed in data breaches in 2015, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center. Nearly 70% of those breaches occurred in the healthcare sector, and almost 20% occurred at government/military agencies. These organizations will likely increase their cybersecurity budgets considerably in the near future, which means more business for "best in breed" perimeter defense companies like FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) and Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW). FireEye's threat prevention platform identifies incoming threats before they strike, and Palo Alto's next-gen firewalls prevent them from reaching internal networks. Larger companies with bundled security solutions -- like Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) -- will also likely see stronger demand for their security appliances and services. Stat number two The global cost of handling cyberattacks is expected to rise from $400 billion in 2015 to $2.1 trillion by 2019, according to estimates from Lloyd's and Juniper Research. That includes direct damage as well as post-attack disruptions. Payroll giant ADP, hard drive maker Seagate, the FBI, the IRS, and the Department of Homeland Security -- which were all struck by data breaches this year -- all know how costly these attacks can be. While larger companies and organizations are gradually responding to these threats, Cisco's 2016 Annual Security Report found that just 29% of small to medium-sized businesses used basic security tools like configuration and patching to prevent breaches -- down from 39% in 2014. Stat number three Despite that apparent complacence, 52% of respondents in CyberEdge Group's 2015 Cyberthreat Defense Report believed that their companies would be hit by successful cyberattacks within the year. That fear is certainly justified -- Symantec, best known to consumers as the maker of Norton Antivirus, recently discovered that three quarters of all websites had exploitable vulnerabilities. Companies like Symantec are also evolving into "all-in-one" guardians for these businesses and organizations. Symantec recently acquired security firm Blue Coat to add its network and cloud protection services to its core portfolio of security solutions for PCs, data centers, and emails. That move makes it an "end-to-end" security provider which offers "layers" or protection, which previously required services from multiple vendors. Stat number four 43% of data breaches were caused internally, according to a report from Intel Security last September. Half of those breaches were accidental, caused by poor security practices, while the other half were intentional -- caused by disgruntled employees and malicious insiders. Although internal data breaches are rising, most cybersecurity companies only focus on external threats with firewalls and threat prevention systems. The standout performer in the internal data breach market is CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR), the market leader in PAM (privileged account management) solutions. CyberArk's platform locks down compromised systems and quarantines internal threats before they can spread to other parts of the network. The key takeaway Investing in most cybersecurity stocks today isn't for queasy investors, since many of these high-growth players have high valuations, low profits, and are prone to wild price swings. However, less risk-averse investors should still keep one or two cybersecurity stocks in their long term portfolio since the market still remains ripe for long-term growth and consolidation.
