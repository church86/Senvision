ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ BENGALURU: More than half the power requirement here of IT multinational Intel's Indian subsidiary is produced from fuel cells using natural gas, Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Friday. "Out of Intel's power requirement of 4MW, 2.5MW is produced using fuel cell based technology using Natural Gas developed by Bloom Energy," Pradhan tweeted following a visit to the Intel R&D centre here. "Visited Intel R&D centre in Bengaluru. The $12 Billion facility is one of the three such facilities in the world," he said. Last month, state-run gas utility GAIL (India) and US-based Bloom Energy signed an agreement to deploy revolutionary natural gas-based fuel cell technology to generate electricity. Gas is already being supplied by GAIL for energising a multi-megawatt Bloom Energy project at the Technology Park here. The technology is currently being used by over 100 of the Fortune 500 companies that are diversified majors in IT, Telecom, retailing, e-commerce and consumer goods. Bloom Energy's solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology converts fuel into electricity using natural gas as the base fuel in a highly efficient non-combustible process that reduces emissions of greenhouse gas and harmful air pollutants, and with minimal use of water. "GAIL is supplying PNG for this to Bloom under an MoU. This Green Energy with no noise & minimal water intake can replace diesel based gensets," Pradhan said in a separate tweet. The minimal use of water is a major consideration here in India's major IT hub, which has witnessed violent street protests this week provoked by the court-mandated release of Cauvery water to neighbouring Tamil Nadu. "Fuel cells can use biogas generated from biomass in rural areas & from municipal wastes in the cities to generate cost-effective green energy," he said "There is a need for promoting this technology. With scale the cost of this will become affordable for common & domestic consumers as well," Pradhan added in another tweet. He also visited the LPG Equipment Research Centre (LERC) here that specialises in testing various liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) equipment. "Asked LERC to think out of box; put consumer convenience on top priority & adopt suggestions given by industry experts & innovators," he tweeted after the LERC visit. "Startups have a great role to play with innovations in making LPG more environment friendly by enhancing efficiency & reducing emissions," he said in another tweet.

The chipmaker now expects third-quarter revenue to check in around $15.6 billion, give or take $300 million. That’s up from its earlier forecast of $14.9 billion (give or take $500 million) which was roughly what analysts were expecting. Share value in Intel is up 2.64 percent to $37.52 as of writing on the revised guidance. According to Reuters, the updated estimate – if it pans out – would be the highest-ever quarterly revenue for Intel which is a bit ironic considering the stale state of the PC industry as of late. It’s been a tumultuous time for traditional PC vendors and suppliers for the better part of the past decade as consumers shift their computing habits from desktops and notebooks to smartphones and tablets. Intel had an early opportunity to supply the processor in the first iPhone but executives declined because the two sides couldn’t agree to financial terms. In hindsight, that proved to be a major misstep, one that Intel has tried to rectify for years with little success. Intel has reportedly rekindled a relationship with Apple although not as a CPU supplier. PC sales are likely on the rise now that Microsoft is no longer offering its free Windows 10 upgrade. Rather than sticking with an outdated machine running an old operating system, some are no doubt opting to buy a new PC.

Reuters/Brendan McDermid The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will reportedly cost $100 more than its predecessor Surface Pro 4. Microsoft has not revealed anything about its upcoming, widely-anticipated device. It may or may not reveal something in the upcoming October event. The tech giant will be hosting a Windows 10 Devices event in October. As per The Bitbag, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will cost a $100 more as it will be including the Intel Kaby Lake processor. The device will also run on the upgraded Windows 10 OS. The company has a lot of features planned for the device. The Intel processors will boost battery life, a requirement that every Surface fan is craving for. The Intel Kaby Lake processor brings native USB support whereas the Skylake ones need third-party hardware for USB support. The new processors are expected to make the size of Surface Pro 5 handier. The processors will also enable 4K tech and support a 3,840×2,160 pixels UHD display. Nothing is official at this point though Microsoft launched the Surface Pro 4 device in October 2015. The company is holding the Windows 10 event in October this year too. This has made tech enthusiasts and fans excited because of the possibility of a Surface Pro 5 and Surface Phone 2016 announcement. However, it is unlikely that the device will be launched in October. There are several hints that Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will be launched only in 2017 and not this year. Even though Intel has released low power Y and U Kaby Lake processors, Microsoft wants to include the most powerful processor form Intel and for that it will have to wait till end of this year. Microsoft is also working on the Windows 10 update, Redstone 2, which is expected to be ready by spring of 2017. It is unlikely that Microsoft will release the Surface Pro 5 without the Redstone 2 update. This again points at a 2017 release. There are reports that Microsft, during the October event, will simply refresh the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book, replacing the processors and implementing minor upgrades.

By Sean Portnoy | September 17, 2016 -- 00:58 GMT (17:58 PDT) | Topic: Mobility HP ProBook 400 business laptop HP's revamp of its ProBook line of business laptops isn't as sexy as some of its recent notebook announcements, but it's certainly trying its best to make us think so. The company's blog post announcing the new models mentions millennials twice in an effort to show it's listening to the youngest workers out there and what they think about business portables. What's Hot on ZDNet When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office? GE Digital builds up its global presence with acquisitions, partnerships ​Domino's claims world-first pizza drone delivery Microsoft delivers test builds of Visual Studio for Mac, Visual Studio 2017 for Windows And what do millennials want? Why a more stylish laptop, of course. (Because Gen Xers and Baby Boomers love heavy, boxy notebooks and wouldn't also prefer not having to schlepp extra heft around.) Luckily, young and old alike can enjoy the slimmer ProBook 400 models (as little as 3.3 pounds for the ProBook 430 G4) -- five new ones in total -- which include a new "Asteroid Silver" chassis color and reflective HP logo to give them a slightly more contemporary look. More important to the business buyers and IT staff is the durability HP bakes into the new ProBooks. The company says the laptops have passed MIL-STD 810G standard tests for resistance to drops and shocks, dust, and extreme temperature, and that it has tested their reliabilitiy for 120,000 hours. Virtual security is provided by Trusted Platform Module 2.0 hardware and HP's self-healing BIOSphere protection. The new ProBooks also enjoy the latest processors from both AMD and Intel. The ProBook 455 G4 features AMD's seventh-generation A series processors, while the other models use Intel's seventh-generation "Kaby Lake" Core CPUs. Each version can be configured in a number of ways, with a maximum of 16GB of RAM and choice of various hard drives or SSDs for storage. Select models can come with Nvidia's GeForce 930MX mobile graphics, and all feature USB-C ports and run Windows 10 Pro. With a 13.3-inch display, the ProBook 430 G4 is the smallest of the new models, with the 14-inch 440 close behind. The 450 joins the 455 as 15.6-inch editions, while the 17.3-inch 470 being the largest new ProBook, though still weighing in under 6 pounds. It's also the only new laptop with a standard screen resolution of 1,600x900, with the others sporting 1,366x768 screens. All models can be upgraded to full HD displays or touchscreens. Those options and the choice of beefier components will quickly increase the reasonable starting prices for the new ProBooks. Owing no doubt to the AMD processor inside, the 455 is the cheapest at $499, with the 440's starting price $30 more. The 430 and 450 base configurations begin at $599, while the desktop replacement-sized 470 is priciest with a $749 starting cost. HP says the new ProBooks are already on sale, but only the 440 G4 is available to purchase on the HP site at the time of this writing and in a much pricier configuration than the base model's price suggests.

By Liam Tung | September 15, 2016 -- 11:32 GMT (04:32 PDT) | Topic: Hardware As well as a gold finish option, the XPS 13 comes with either a QHD touch display with a Core i7 or the FHD display with Core i5. Image: Dell Dell has refreshed its popular XPS 13 laptop with Intel's seventh-generation Core processors. The update brings a longer battery life, among other improvements, and a new rose-gold option for those who want a change from the usual silver. The move brings Dell's XPS 13 in line with other hardware carrying Intel's new chips, such as the recently-released Lenovo Yoga 910. Tech Pro Research System Monitoring Policy Going old school with tape backup Leaders share software-defined networking's benefits, obstacles, favored vendors TechRepublic's Depreciation Calculator Shipping with Windows 10, the XPS 13 will be available with either a QHD+ touch display with the latest Core i7 processor or the FHD display with a new Core i5 processor. Dell says the QHD+ model's battery will last up to 13 hours, while the FHD model will last up to 22 hours, thanks to a larger 60Wh battery. They also feature Dell's super-thin bezels, which it calls the InfinityEdge Display. Dell is touting two configurations, the FHD model with 8GB RAM, 256GB solid-state storage, and Intel's seventh generation i5 Core processors, as well as the QHD+ model with the same RAM and storage configurations but with Intel's latest Core i7 processor. Dell is also releasing an updated Developer Edition of the XPS 13 that ships with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Its predecessor, the 2016 Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition, is Linux creator Linus Torvalds' preferred laptop for programming and rated by ZDNet's open-source expert Steven J Vaughan-Nichols as the best laptop for serious programmers. ZDNet has contacted Dell's Europe office for more details and pricing. However, according to The Verge, the updated XPS 13 will also be available with Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 options, as well as 4G, 8GB, and 16GB memory options. Buyers will also be able choose 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB SSD. According to Dell, the XPS 13 and XPS 13 Developer Edition will be available from October 4, starting at $799 and $949 respectively. However, buyers who want gold will pay gold prices. Those starting prices only apply to the standard silver option, while the new rose-gold models start at $1,149.

By Rex Crum | rcrum@bayareanewsgroup.com PUBLISHED: September 16, 2016 at 2:53 pm | UPDATED: September 16, 2016 at 2:55 pm Top Of The Order: Oracle’s Balancing Act: As far as Oracle is concerned, “TGIF” should be re-christened as “TGIFO,” as in “Thank Goodness It’s Finally Over.” At least when it comes to the Oracle’s feelings about how investors reacted on Friday to the software giant’s latest earnings report. Oracle shares fell almost 5 percent to end the day at $38.92. It was the lowest closing point for Oracle’s stock in almost three months. There was really no surprise about why Oracle’s stock took such a hit. Investors didn’t like what they saw in the company’s fiscal first-quarter results, which came out late Thursday. For the quarter ended in August, Oracle earned $1.83 billion, or 43 cents a share, on revenue of $8.6 billion. During the same period a year ago, Oracle earned $1.75 billion, or 40 cents a share, on $8.45 billion. However, excluding one-time items, Oracle earned 55 cents a share, which fell short of the estimates of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters, who forecast Oracle to earn 58 cents a share on $8.7 billion in sales. Oracle has been putting more of its emphasis on cloud-based software and services so it can compete better with the likes of Salesforce.com and Workday. Oracle founder, Chairman and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison also used a conference call late Thursday to say that Oracle’s “new data centers give us a significant cost and performance advantage over Amazon” and its web services business. But that didn’t matter for much in the minds of investors. Revenue from cloud computing climbed 59 percent from a year, but hardware sales fell 12 percent, new software license revenue was down 11 percent and total software sales were flat with the same period a year ago. “Attaining the balance (with cloud and other sales) continues to be tricky,” said UBS analyst Brent Thill in a research note about Oracle’s results. “Progress (in its cloud business) is clear, encouraging, and largely incremental. (But) this continues to come with an inferior (profit) margin profile,” with regards to its traditional software business. Thill also questioned if the “real compression” on Oracle’s earnings is yet to come. A few more quarterly reports like Thursday’s will give some more evidence about Oracle’s earnings. At least on Friday, Oracle’s shareholders showed how compressed their sentiment about the company had become. Middle Innings:  Meanwhile, With Intel…: While Oracle let out a figurative sigh when the stock market closed Friday, Intel probably would have been happy if trading could go on all weekend. That’s because on Friday, before the stock market opened, Intel raised its business outlook for its fiscal third quarter. Intel said that it now expects sales in the three-month period to be between $15.3 billion and $15.9 billion, which is higher than the company’s earlier forecast for revenue between $14.4 billion and $15.4 billion. Intel said it raised its sales outlook primarily because of “replenishment of PC supply chain inventory,” and “the company is also seeing some signs of improving PC demand.” And demand for Intel’s stock was strong all day Friday. Early in the day, Intel’s shares touched $38.05, their highest point in 15 years. By the time the stock market closed, Intel’s shares had risen 3 percent to end the week at $37.67. What a concept. Good, old-fashioned PC sales getting better? Somebody must be doing some early Christmas shopping. Bottom Of The Lineup:  Here’s a look at how some other leading Silicon Valley stocks did Friday… Movin’ On Up: Gains came from Depomed, QuinStreet, GoPro, Aviat Networks and Twitter, which saw its shares climb more than 4 percent following its first live-stream of an NFL game on Thursday night. In The Red: Decliners included Synaptics, Extreme Networks, Nimble Storage, Ultra Tech and Super Micro Computer. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index shed 0.1 percent to close at 5,244.57. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 0.5 percent to finish the week at 18,123.80. And the broad-based Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.4 percent to fall to 2,139.16.

HYDERABAD: Intel has agreed to buy Soft Machines, a Silicon Valley-based chip-design company founded by an Indian-origin entrepreneur for nearly $300 million ( Rs 2,000 crore), according to two people aware of the development. "It is a cash-cum-stock deal with a cash component of over $250 million," said one of the sources, who did not want to be identified, adding that "all the professionals of Soft Machines have become part of Intel from Thursday." The news was first reported by technology website The Register. Intel declined to comment. Representatives of Soft Machines were not available for comment. Soft Machines, which says its technology helps chips compute faster and more efficiently, was cofounded by Andhra Pradesh native Mahesh Lingareddy and Mohammad A Abdallah, a native of Jordan. Both are former Intel veterans. A profile of Lingareddy on the company's website describes him as an alumnus of Andhra University in Kakinada and University of Toledo. Soft Machines, founded in 2006 and based in Santa Clara, has raised $175 million from investors that includeSamsung Ventures, AMD and Global Foundries. All existing investors will exit the venture and Intel will take full control, the sources said. Teams from Intel have already initiated the process of expanding the four-year-old operations of Soft Machines in Hyderabad by acquiring office space in the Financial District. "The plan is to see that the team size is increased more than 10-fold over the next two-three years to nearly 2,000," one person said.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Dell updates its popular XPS 13 notebook with Kaby Lake CPUs by Wayne Manion  3:01 PM on September 16, 2016 Dell has refreshed its competitor to Apple's Macbook (Air), the XPS 13 notebook. The updated model utilizes Intel's latest Kaby Lake silicon in place of Skylake chips. The existing XPS 13 can be optioned with Core i3, i5, and i7 CPUs. Core i3-7100U, i5-7200U, and i7-7500U Kaby Lake chips will be available when the updated XPS 13 begins shipping in the first week of October. All available CPUs in the existing and new models are dual-core, four-thread parts. Battery capacity increases from 56 watt-hours to 60 watt-hours, and CPU power consumption is reduced in Intel's latest and greatest laptop chips, leading to  an estimated 22-hour battery life. Both the old and the new XPS 13s are available with Dell's "InfinityEdge" narrow-bezel displays in standard 1080p or optional 3200x1800 resolutions. Don't plan on around-the-clock battery life with the upgraded panel, though. Unplugged runtime with the 1800p screen drops to a more pedestrian 13 hours. Dell did not describe the test methology used to obtain those figures. Wi-Fi snobs may lament a shift away from Intel Wi-Fi controllers towards solutions from Killer Networking. The Wi-Fi solution offers support for 802.11ac 2x2 MIMO and Bluetooth 4.1. Existing and new models include a single USB 3.1 Type-C Thunderbolt 3 port, PCIe solid state storage with up to 1TB capacity, and as much as 16GB of system memory. The memory type for the new model has not yet been specified, but Skylake models use DDR3 RAM. If the laptop's diminutive dimensions didn't tell you the machine is intended to lead Dell's charge against the Apple's Macbook, perhaps the silver, gold, and new rose gold chassis color options make it more obvious. The new machine will start at $799 when it ships on October 4. Expect prices of the upgraded i5 and i7 models to mirror their counterparts in the current generation: current i5 models start at $899, and high-end i7 models with the QHD+ display will require forking over just short of $2000. While nearly all XPS 13 machines will likely ship with some variation of Windows 10, a Developer Edition with Ubuntu 16.04 preinstalled will also be available.  Tags: Mobile computing Register | Remember me View options x Subscriber options: E-mail me when people reply to my comments Comment sorting order: Flat, chronologicalNo threading.

News & Analysis iPhone 7 Sports Intel, TSMC Rick Merritt 9/16/2016 02:20 PM EDT 4 comments NO RATINGS 2 saves Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. — A teardown posted today confirmed Apple put Intel inside at least some of its iPhone 7 handsets, using the x86 giants baseband processors acquired from Infineon. The report said Apple used TSMC to make at least some of its A10 Fusion SoCs, probably using its InFO packaging process as well. Both Intel and TSMC were expected to win the sockets in the latest iPhones announced earlier this month. The teardowns confirm earlier reports of deals that represent millions of dollars of business to both companies, probably making Intel the third largest supplier of cellular baseband chips behind Qualcomm and Mediatek. iPhone 7 plus and 7, as seen on Apple.com. The first joint teardown from Chipworks and TechInsights found an Intel PMB9943 baseband processor believed to be the Intel XMM7360 modem inside an iPhone 7 Model A1778. It also found two Intel PMB5750s SMARTI 5 RF transceivers and an Intel PMB6826, otherwise called X-PMU 736. Interestingly, separate teardowns by iFixit of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models both found them using Qualcomm MDM9645M LTE Cat. 12 modems. The iFixit analysts use Chipworks to help ID chips they find. Chipworks speculated Apple might use Qualcomm chips in its iPhone 7 CDMA A1660. Qualcomm invented the technology behind the CDMA standard which Intels former Infineon group apparently does not support.

A look at the iPhone 7's innards confirms an intriguing rumor about the cellular modems powering Apple's latest handset: at least some of the modems are made by Intel, not Qualcomm. Chipworks added images of its iPhone 7 teardown to its blog this week, which show RF transceivers and a cellular transmitter made by Intel. More specifically, the Chipworks teardown appears to reveal an Intel XMM7360 modem, which would make the iPhone 7 capable of the 450Mbps LTE download speeds that Apple has promised. While Chipworks picked apart the iPhone 7 on sale in the US and Europe, rival teardown gurus at iFixit used a Japanese version, which has a Qualcomm modem instead. That modem is a category 12, which means it's theoretically capable of up to 600Mpbs LTE download speeds. Apple never reveals specifics about the guts of its iPhones, and keeps its modem technology especially secret. But these teardowns and others of previous iPhones make that an open secret; modems in recent iPhone models have mostly been sourced from Qualcomm. The fact that Apple is adding an Intel modem to the mix this time for phones sold in the US means that not all iPhone 7s will work with all American carriers. Apple's official spec sheet for the iPhone 7 lists two sets of units sold in the US. Models A1660 (iPhone 7) and A1661 (iPhone 7 Plus) work on all four major US networks and virtual networks like Ting, Ultra Mobile, and Consumer Cellular. Models A1778 (iPhone 7) and A1784 (iPhone 7 Plus) do not have CDMA modems and thus don't work on Verizon, Sprint, or any smaller carrier that uses those networks. //Related Articles If You Want to Switch Carriers, Buy Verizon's iPhone 7 In its teardown, iFixit also found that Apple applied lots of adhesive to the iPhone 7's edges, a lot more than in previous models. That likely helps the phone's water resistance: the iPhone 7 is the first Apple handset to be able to survive complete immersion in water. It is rated IP67, which means it should withstand immersion in three feet of water for up to 30 minutes without damage. Finally, the lack of the headphone jack makes room for hardware that powers the new "taptic" feedback home button, iFixit found. It uses haptic feedback to simulate a push, though the button itself is stationary. Back to top Previous : LG, Mediatek Break Qualcomm's Hold on Sprint With LG X Power...

REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun/FilesMore By Narottam Medhora REUTERS - Intel Corp raised its quarterly revenue forecast for the first time in more than two years as suppliers of parts used in personal computers replenish their inventory amid improving PC demand. Shares of the world's largest chipmaker rose as much as 4.1 percent to a more than 15-year high of $38.05 on Friday. Intel, which helped found the personal computer industry, has been struggling as tech users shift away from PCs to mobile phones for their computing needs. Sales in the company's PC business declined 3 percent to $7.3 billion in the latest quarter. The unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets. However, there have been signs PC demand may be recovering. HP Inc, which houses the hardware business of the former Hewlett-Packard Co, said last month that revenue in its computer business rose 7.5 percent in the third quarter from the second as sales of notebooks improved. FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi said commentary from Intel and HP suggested that PCs were "not as dead as people were thinking." Research firm IDC said in July global PC shipments fell less than expected in the second quarter, helped by strength in the United States. "We expect PC units to decline less than the high-single-digit decline consensus in 2017, driven by continued Windows 10 upgrades and accelerating SSD adoption, along with new form factors," Baird Equity Research analyst Tristan Gerra wrote, raising his price target to $42 from $40. Intel said on Friday it expected third-quarter revenue to be $15.6 billion, plus or minus $300 million, compared with its prior forecast of $14.9 billion, plus or minus $500 million. That implies the highest-ever quarterly revenue for Intel, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts on average were expecting $14.90 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said the pre-announcement was a good first step to the PC story stabilizing at Intel, and raised his price target by $2 to $38. Shares of rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc were up about 1 percent, while those of Micron Technology Inc and HP were marginally higher. Shares of Santa Clara, California-based Intel were up 2.6 percent at $37.53 in afternoon trading. Up to Thursday's close, the stock had risen 6.1 percent this year, underperforming the 20.8 percent gain in the broader Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index during the period.

Brian Barrett Gear Date of Publication: 09.16.16. 09.16.16 Time of Publication: 2:23 pm. 2:23 pm Intel’s Chips Finally Find Their Way Into the iPhone Apple's Phil Schiller unveils the new iPhone 7 during an event in San Francisco, on September 7, 2016.David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images The smartphone years have not been kind to Intel. The company ignored the transition to mobile early on, allowing ARM-based processors to take an early, decisive lead. Intel’s presence in pocket computers hasn’t just been minimal, it’s been practically nonexistent. That is, until the iPhone 7. Bloomberg first reported that Intel had worked out a deal with Apple in June, but now that the iPhone 7 has shipped, we have actual confirmation, thanks to a teardown from Chipworks. Apple may make its own processors now, but Intel’s providing an entire mobile cellular platform to the Cupertino company, the transceivers and modem that help put the “phone” in smartphone. For the first time, a flagship mobile device has Intel inside. Better late than never. Fashionably Late Intel’s made it into a handful of smartphones before, but this really is the first component placement at anything that could be considered serious scale. “Intel has been working eight, nine years for something like this to happen,” says Patrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights & Strategy. “You have the premiere smartphone brand in Apple, who has incredibly high quality and experience metrics.” Being in the iPhone, in other words, isn’t important simply for sales. It gives Intel components Apple’s imprimatur, a potential signal to other companies that it’s ready to play in the big leagues. Inclusion in the iPhone 7 also, counterintuitively, highlights some of Intel’s drawbacks. Intel components won’t be in every model, in large part because they don’t support the CDMA networks deployed by Verizon and Sprint. Moorhead notes that they’re also not as future-proof as Qualcomm’s high-end equivalents: Intel’s guts don’t play nice with brand-new tech that will allow for faster download speeds, whenever carriers get around to leveling up. Since people are holding onto their devices longer than ever now, some iPhone 7 owners could potentially end up feeling left out. And however many iPhones Intel ends up in, it’s unlikely to impact the company’s bottom line much. That’s partly, Moorhead says, because Intel likely had to set a very competitive price to win Apple’s business. Mostly, though, it’s just a function of the company’s evolving business model. “Intel’s such a big company, with such high margins, particularly on the data center but also on the PC side, that I don’t see this making a material financial impact,” says Moorhead. Intel is, after all, a cloud company. It may have missed mobile, but it dominates in servers. That doesn’t mean that its iPhone win is just a moral victory. Its real importance? Setting Intel up for the next mobile revolution. Everybody 5G When Intel’s Aicha Evans took the stage at this year’s Mobile World Congress in February, she spent an hour focused not on current smartphone ambitions, but about a future cellular network standard: 5G. We could spend a few thousand words outlining 5G in detail, but the short version should work for now. Remember the transition from 3G to 4G, how the Internet on your phone was suddenly much, much faster? It was the difference between clacking up a roller coaster’s first incline and barreling down the other side. That’s what 5G will feel like next to 4G, with some smart home and wearables support thrown in as a bonus. Qualcomm won 4G, no question. It wasn’t even close. We’re still far enough from 5G cohering as an actual thing, though, that any of a handful of companies could position themselves as the dominant force of the next generation of mobile. One of those companies (surprise!) is Intel. “the big prize here is 5G,” says Moorhead. “But if you’re not successful in 4G, there’s no way for you to be successful in 5G.” Intel can talk all it wants about its prominent role in the future of mobile, but it’ll have a lot harder time actualizing that if it can’t prove it can handle the present. If someone can’t make a layup, you wouldn’t bet on them to dunk. Intel declined to comment on its role in the new iPhone. Because of course it did. If you want everyone to think you’re a winner, you act like you’ve been there before. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. 5G Intel iPhone Mobile smartphones Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

The Apple-designed A10 Fusion chip is “incredibly thin,” Chipworks has discovered, thanks to TSMC’s InFO packaging technique resulting in a thinner package. Perhaps more interesting than that, the AT&T and T-Mobile edition of the handset indeed comes with Intel’s LTE modem inside versus Qualcomm’s that powers cellular connectivity in other hardware versions of the device. What that means is that, because iPhone 7 models “A1778” and “A1784“ have an Intel modem inside which doesn’t support CDMA networks, these handsets cannot be used on Verizon and Sprint networks. Specifically, Intel supplied a pair of RF transceivers (SMARTI 5 built on TSMC’S 28-nanometer process), the baseband modem and the power management circuitry (the X-PMU 736, part of Intel’s XMM 7360 platform). “We see Intel’s baseband modem PMB9943 and suspect this is the rumored Intel XMM7360 modem,” says Chipworks. That’s in stark contrast to the iPhone 6s, which has a universal modem that supports most cellular networks. Qualcomm’s MDM9645M LTE Cat. 12 modem is present in all of the other carrier models of the iPhone 7 instead of Intel’s. As for the battery, the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 that Chipworks and TechInsights pried open has a 1,960 mAh, 3.8 V (7.45 Wh) battery that gives it two additional hours of performance compared with the iPhone 6 battery rated at 1,810 mAh, 6.9 Wh. In comparison, the exploding batteries in the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 are 15.4 Wh, twice the size. The iPhone 7 Plus has a 2,900 mAh battery that lasts an hour longer than that in the iPhone 6s Plus, a slight upgrade over the 2,750 mAh cell in the iPhone 6s Plus and a step down from a 2,915 mAh (11.1 Wh) one in the iPhone 6 Plus. The firms have also confirmed that Apple’s A10 Fusion chip (part number APL1W24) in their unit was built by TSMC, confirming rumors that it’s being single-sourced from TSMC. MegaChips (formerly SiTime) supplied one of their MEMS clock circuitry commonly used in wearables and some game controllers. A10 Fusion in X-ray vision. The A10 Fusion package has a die size is of about 125 square millimeter and is “incredibly thin”, giving credibility to the reports that TSMC’s InFO packaging technique is being used. Similar to the low-power mobile DRAM in the iPhone 6s, the iPhone 7 uses package-on-package assembly which puts the A10 chip below 2GB of Samsung-built LPDDR4 RAM (the iPhone 7 Plus has 3 GB of RAM). “Looking at the X-rays we see the four dies are not stacked, but are spread out across the package,” which helps keep the overall package height to a minimum. The combination of package-on-package assembly and TSMC’s InFO packaging technique helps reduce total chip height significantly. They also found 128 GB of NAND flash (a 16-die stack of 128-Gb parts) with EMI shielding, fabricated in 15-nanometer process technology. Both SK Hynix and Toshiba have been identified as NAND flash suppliers for the new iPhones. A10 Fusion die shot. A Broadcom-provided GPS module (BCM47734) possibly contains Sensor Hub functionality that combines the GPS and sensors such as gyroscopes, barometers, accelerometers and others. Apple did confirm that the A10 Fusion has its own sensor hub. That said, if the Broadcom part used in the device does have a sensor hub “it may not be utilized here in the iPhone 7,” cautions Chipworks. There are also three audio amplifiers (two in the iPhone 6s): two to drive each of the two speakers while the third could be for the headphone via the Lightning port. On a somewhat related note, Tech Insights, Inc. and Chipworks have now combined their respective businesses to become a global leader in advanced semiconductor technology intelligence, analysis and reverse engineering.

Javiers Verizon service will always be better regardless of the phone. Alan Aurmont Not talking about service quality here, rather the versatility of Verizon iPhone. kinny james Yes, the Verizon phone is the way to go if you’ll want to use it on non-GSM networks. The Verizon model will work on both network types. The Att/T-mobile will only work on GSM out of the box. I’m not sure about getting it unlocked though. BTW T-mobile service is far superior than Verizon in NYC, so it’s all a matter of location and use. I get speeds that are way faster than Verizon. Leviscus Tempris Of the hardware does not physically support another network then I am afraid that the answer is that it would not be able to be unlocked:( n0ahcruz3 Nope because GSM>CDMA. And most countries uses GSM technology. Alan Aurmont Most Asia is CDMA. So, your “most countries” claim is inaccurate. n0ahcruz3 Name these “most Asia”. I know SK and japan uses CDMa. Im asian, do more research there’s google. Alan Aurmont How about the largest country in Asia called China? n0ahcruz3 GSm lol Agneev Mukherjee Reliance was the last CDMA operator in India; two months back, they started upgrading CDMA customers to 4G compulsorily… I had one of em’ CDMA phones with an integrated SIM card, which couldn’t be removed. Jose Rivera The Verizon variant has always been my favorite because they’re all factory unlocked and support both network types… A huge plus for them… Fede777 What’s the reason they went with 2 different modems, instead of a universal one? Christian Zibreg Well, for starters, they gain advantage in supply chain negotiations by having multiple suppliers for a component. I’d say that’s part of a broader move to Intel LTE modems across all iPhone models in the future. The ultimate goal, I suspect: eventually embed the baseband modem itself with any supporting logic into the A-series chips to save space and optimize power consumption Fede777 I get that, but when the 6 launched they were all about “world phone”, well not anymore. Christian Zibreg That’s the limitation of the Intel chip. My guess is that Apple would have surely used a universal Intel modem if they provided it. Rowan09 But CDMA is not really a world standard GSM is, so I don’t believe this will be an issue. Christian Zibreg Actually, these are world phones. From the FAQ section on Apple’s Buy iPhone 7 webpage: Can I use an iPhone when traveling internationally? All iPhone models are world phones, so you can use them almost anywhere. Whether you are a GSM or CDMA network customer, you can roam internationally on GSM networks in over 200 countries around the world. Availability of LTE data varies in some countries and depends on carrier support for certain LTE radio frequencies. Contact your wireless carrier for more information regarding international roaming policies and rates.

Source: stargazer2020 via Flickr This is not something anyone holding INTC is used to. After all, the chipmaker hasn’t hiked a quarterly forecasts in more than two years. The reasons for the improved outlook were also a nice break from the norm. PC sales were not as bad as INTC expected. A 15-year high for Intel stock is kind of remarkable considering how much trouble it faces, at least on a strategic basis. It was already stressed by a world that’s ditching PCs for mobile devices. That there’s no question that desktop computers are in secular decline should have been enough. Now it has to compete in the cloud business as well. INTC is making every effort to pivot away from the PC supply chain toward more relevant markets. But it’s like turning a cruise liner in choppy seas. As a result, the market’s faith in Intel stock ebbs and flows. It’s been essentially range-bound for two years. The Top 10 S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now Perhaps this latest bit of good news can serve as the catalyst that fuels a breakout. As under-confident as the market may be on Intel stock, shares are now up 9% after Friday’s pop. That beats the S&P 500 — which it has trailed all year long — by about 5 percentage points. INTC’s Revised Outlook Is Not a Complete Surprise That’s not bad at all as long as the market doesn’t get carried away with this change in guidance. Intel said at the end of the second quarter that it saw improvement in the PC business. Market researchers also seeing better-than-expected shipments of PCs in Q2. Theoretically, at least, some of today’s move should have already been priced into Intel stock. Still, there’s nothing quite like putting it on the board. The company now sees Q3 revenue in a range of $15.3 billion to $15.9 billion. The prior forecast stood at $14.4 billion to $15.4 billion. Analysts on average were looking for the top line to hit $14.9 billion, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters. It looks like Intel dispensed with any downside risk to sales when it reports next month. That’s worth something but be careful of getting too high on the news. Intel said its improved prospects are partially due to the need to replenish inventory in the PC supply chain. That’s a cyclical phenomenon. As much as INTC wants to become less reliant on PCs, it still still derives the majority of its revenue from that business. Intel stock certainly deserves a higher premium from higher guidance, but the mid-day gain of 2.5% may be all it warrants. It’s also important to keep in mind that Intel didn’t touch its earnings forecast despite the improved outlook for revenue. INTC is a blue-chip stock with a decent dividend when investors are strapped for yield. It isn’t particularly expensive either. However, today’s move is probably sufficient to price in the update. It will have to follow up today’s news with something even better when it drops quarterly earnings in October. As of this writing, Dan Burrows did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Toggle Navigation A-   A+ Sign in News   Stock Home «Back Intel raises revenue forecast as PC market improves Reuters |  Sep 16, 2016 10:08 PM IST By Narottam Medhora REUTERS - Intel Corp raised its quarterly revenue forecast for the first time in more than two years as suppliers of parts used in personal computers replenish their inventory amid improving PC demand. Shares of the world's largest chipmaker rose as much as 4.1 percent to a more than 15-year high of $38.05 on Friday. Intel, which helped found the personal computer industry, has been struggling as tech users shift away from PCs to mobile phones for their computing needs. Sales in the company's PC business declined 3 percent to $7.3 billion in the latest quarter. The unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets. However, there have been signs PC demand may be recovering. HP Inc, which houses the hardware business of the former Hewlett-Packard Co, said last month that revenue in its computer business rose 7.5 percent in the third quarter from the second as sales of notebooks improved. FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi said commentary from Intel and HP suggested that PCs were "not as dead as people were thinking." Research firm IDC said in July global PC shipments fell less than expected in the second quarter, helped by strength in the United States. "We expect PC units to decline less than the high-single-digit decline consensus in 2017, driven by continued Windows 10 upgrades and accelerating SSD adoption, along with new form factors," Baird Equity Research analyst Tristan Gerra wrote, raising his price target to $42 from $40. Intel said on Friday it expected third-quarter revenue to be $15.6 billion, plus or minus $300 million, compared with its prior forecast of $14.9 billion, plus or minus $500 million. That implies the highest-ever quarterly revenue for Intel, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts on average were expecting $14.90 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said the pre-announcement was a good first step to the PC story stabilizing at Intel, and raised his price target by $2 to $38. Shares of rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc were up about 1 percent, while those of Micron Technology Inc and HP were marginally higher. Shares of Santa Clara, California-based Intel were up 2.6 percent at $37.53 in afternoon trading. Up to Thursday's close, the stock had risen 6.1 percent this year, underperforming the 20.8 percent gain in the broader Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index during the period.

Intel’s latest 2016-2018 roadmap detailing the next generation processors for mobility platform has been leaked out. Slides pertaining the Kaby Lake, Coffee Lake and Cannonlake processors were leaked out by the community forums at Anandtech. A lot of juicy details and specific time points for theses processors have been detailed in the roadmap. Intel 2016-2018 Roadmap Leaks Out – Details Kaby Lake, Coffee Lake and Cannonlake Processors We have already learnt that Intel has faced delays with their process node roadmap which led them to delay specific lineups. Intel has also upgraded their Tick Tock strategy to PAO (Process-Architecture-Optimization) leading to a three year cadence. This allows Intel’s to implement further optimizations and architectural improvements to their existing process nodes rather than moving to a new process every two years. Intel is offering consumers three four different product lines based on 14nm. These include Broadwell, Skylake, the upcoming Kaby Lake and 2017’s Coffee Lake. Intel’s 14nm Kaby Lake, Coffee Lake and 10nm Cannonlake CPU roadmap leaks out. (Image Credits: Anandtech Forums) All four processor lines are based on the 14nm process which has been updated significantly to offer technical edge over competitors. With Skylake launched, eyes are now on Kaby Lake which was recently introduced on mobility platforms. Kaby Lake-Y and Kaby Lake-U series has already been launched. So let’s take a detailed look. Kaby Lake 2016-2017 Roadmap Intel Kaby Lake processors are based on 14nm process node. These processors feature a refined architecture that has received much of of its DNA base from Skylake. The Kaby Lake-Y (Core M) series is offered in 4.5W SOC designs with GT2 level graphics chips The Kaby Lake-U series have also been introduced and come in 15W and 28W design with the latter available with GT3e graphics chips. The “e” denoting the embedded DRAM cache. Kaby Lake-H is designed for high-performance notebooks and comes in 45W package. These aren’t full SOC designs and don’t do anything beyond GT2 graphics but are Quad core designs with good performance at hand. Cannonlake 2017-2018 Roadmap The Cannonlake processors would be Intel’s first architecture designed on the 10nm node. Available in Q4 2017, these chips will first be aimed at ultra low-TDP and ultra-low power platforms. The Cannonlake-Y series would feature 5.2W TDP, a slight increase over current 14nm processors. The Cannonlake-U series will also hit market during the same time and feature 15W SKUs. Both series will come in BGA package with the PCH embedded on the die itself, fulfilling the SOC standards. The chips will also include GT2 graphics. The architecture would be updated and 10nm would allow for faster clocks to be set on these chips for increased graphics performance. Advertisement Coffee Lake 2018 Roadmap Coffee Lake is an intermediate solution that’s designed to compensate the yields of Intel’s 10nm process for the mission-crucial market. Coffee Lake will be offered only on H and U series chips.. The Coffee Lake U-Series will be available in Q2 2018 in quad core designs with GT3e graphics chips. The Coffee Lake-H series are the true performance parts featuring up to 6 cores. A range of new and modern devices will feature Intel’s latest 14nm and 10nm processors. (Image Credits: Anandtech Forums) This will be the first time Intel would up the core count of their mainstream mobility processors. Available only in hexa-core models, the Coffee Lake-H series will feature 45W TDP along with GT2 graphics chips. It is expected that Intel would also launch desktop series based on the Coffee Lake architecture for their mainstream family, bringing the same high-core variants to gaming PCs. The Desktop Kaby Lake Family Detailed – Announcement Expected at CES 2017 On the desktop front, Intel has plans to announce their Kaby Lake desktop family at CES 2017. Benchlife posted a slide detailing the launch schedule of 200-series chipset which falls in Q4 2016 but mentions that Intel plans to push it back to CES 2017. The launch will include several desktop SKUs along with Z270, H270 and H110 chip sets. Board partners of Intel will be showcasing and promoting a range of new products before and during CES. 7th Gen Core processors are manufactured on silicon wafers at Intel production facilities. New 7th Gen Core processors deliver richer experiences, incredible performance and responsiveness, and true ultra HD 4K entertainment in stunning new devices. The Kaby Lake processors in general would be getting increased core performance (expect the usual 5-10% improvement) unless Intel plans to do something very different with Kaby Lake which seems highly unlikely. The processors will retain the basic features such for enthusiasts such as enhanced full range BCLK overclocking and 95W “Unlocked” options to choose from. Intel 200-series chipset roadmap leaks out at Benchlife. The 200-Series PCH is a crucial update for the upcoming family of processors as it will allow support for them. The Intel 200-series PCH will include several SKUs such as Z270, H270, Q270, Q250 and B250. While the new chipset doesn’t include any major changes over the Skylake PCH, it does include support for Intel Optane technology which utilizes Intel’s 3D XPoint memory to deliver high-performance SSDs and memory solutions. The KBL-PCH will be able to support Mansion Beach (Optane SSD PCIe/NVMe Gen3 x4), Brighton Beach (Optane SSD PCIe/NVMe Gen3 x4) and Stony Beach (Optane Memory PCIe/NVMe Gen 3 x2 (m.2)) solutions.

Some models of the new phone have Intel inside. (AP photo) Print Email Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive By Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive The Oregonian Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 16, 2016 at 7:20 AM, updated September 22, 2016 at 6:51 AM comments Intel is back in the iPhone. The iPhone 7 went on sale Friday and tech whizzes immediately went to work dissecting it to see what's inside. And, as widely expected, some models of the new phone include modems from Intel. That's a big win for the world's largest chipmaker, which has been shut out of the iPhone and most other smartphones after famously arriving late to the mobile computing market. The Canadian engineering firm Chipworks took apart an iPhone 7 and found an Intel modem, a power management chip and two transceivers. Apple's new iPhone comes in two flavors, one for AT&T and T-Mobile and another for other wireless carriers that use the CDMA wireless standard. Intel's technology is apparently only inside the first category of iPhone; a teardown of another iPhone by the repair company iFixit found Qualcomm modems. Early models of the iPhone included modems from the wireless division of German chipmaker Infineon, but Apple switched to Qualcomm soon after Intel bought that business in 2010. Adding Intel to the mix gives Apple a second supplier for key components in its phones, providing Apple pricing leverage and a backup in case one of the suppliers is unwilling or unable to meet demand. Intel boosts sales forecast The modem is just a component, not the microprocessor at the heart of the iPhone 7. Apple designs those itself, using templates licensed from Intel rival ARM Holdings. But Intel has worked for years to get a foothold in the world's most popular smartphone, so its presence in the iPhone 7 marks a milestone and a potential opening to do more. Wireless chipmaker Qorvo also has two chips inside the new iPhone, components manufactured in Hillsboro. The company and its predecessor, TriQuint Semiconductor, have contributed to each of the last several generations of iPhone. Apple keeps its list of suppliers to itself and generally prohibits them from discussing their work with Apple. So investors, rivals and others have to wait until Apple actually releases its new device to determine exactly what components will be in each. -- Mike Rogoway mrogoway@oregonian.com 503-294-7699 @rogoway Inside Silicon Forest About Mike Rogoway Email Mike Rogoway Follow @rogoway Most Read Active Discussions About Us About OregonLive.com Advertise with us Contact the newsroom Frequently Asked Questions Join our team Our Journalists Contact Subscriber Services Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Travel Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Clark County Gresham Portland Washington County More Local News Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Forums Videos Photos Interact with us Weather Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sitemap & search Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2016 Oregon Live LLC.

Both the Chipworks/TechInsights team and iFixit have completed their respective initial teardowns of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, tearing part some of the first phones to go on sale. These teardowns are preliminary – there’s a lot of work left to do in deciphering the many cryptic identification numbers of the various components – but right off the bat it confirms a few things about each of the phones. We’ll start off with the Chipworks teardown of an iPhone 7, which they have already earnestly begun identifying chips on. One of their immediate findings is that for the first time in a while, Apple is using a non-Qualcomm modem. On Chipworks’ GSM phone, they have found an Intel baseband processor with the model number PMB9943. They believe this to be part of Intel’s XMM 7360 modem, which was announced back in 2015. The XMM 7360 is a high-end LTE Advanced modem design that offers up to Category 10 performance (450 Mbps down). This is achieved in part through the use of 3x carrier aggregation, which allows the modem to use up to 60Mhz of wireless spectrum. The modem does not support CDMA, and as the iFixit team has turned up a Qualcomm Snapdragon X12 (Cat 12) modem in their unit, Apple is clearly using modems from multiple vendors. It’s not clear how this breakdown works – if Apple is using the Qualcomm modem in some GSM phones as well – but at a minimum the Qualcomm modem will have to be in all of the CDMA-capable models. Meanwhile for Intel’s modem group, this is a significant win, as the company has not seen too many high-profile device wins in recent years. Though historically speaking, this is actually something of a return to form. The original iPhone used a modem from the group’s predecessor, Infineon’s wireless unit, whom Intel purchased in 2010. Moving on, we have of course the A10 Fusion SoC. Chipworks has yet to get a die shot in, but they have already confirmed that the SoC is produced by TSMC. This is presumably another 16nm FinFET SoC, but the Chipworks team will be working to confirm that. So far there is no evidence to indicate that Apple is dual-sourcing SoCs on the iPhone 7 like they did the iPhone 6s, but this is again preliminary information. Given that Apple doesn’t get a major new manufacturing process to use this generation, I had been wondering if and how Apple would instead compromise on die size, and we now have a rough answer. Chipworks estimates the A10 die to be roughly 125mm2 in size. This is 20.5mm2 (~20%) larger than the A9 TSMC die. The good news for Apple is that yields should be much better in 2016 than they were in 2015, so chip manufacturing costs should be down, helping to offset the higher costs of the larger chip. And while there are ways to improve performance without increasing the die size, any kind of significant improvement would have to entail a larger die, which is exactly what we’re seeing here. If nothing else, Apple would need more room for the new high-efficiency CPU cores the chip packs in. Speaking of packing, Chipworks’ teardown also hints that the A10 may have been packaged using TSMC’s new Integrated Fan Out (InFO) technique, which is meant to allow for thinner chip packages. InFO saves space, in part, by eliminating the organic substrate that logic dies have traditionally been mounted on. Lastly with the A10, Chipworks’ teardown of their iPhone 7 confirms that it has 2GB of RAM, specifically Samsung LPDDR4. Besides confirming that the memory capacity on the iPhone 7 hasn’t increased versus the iPhone 6s, this is notable because iFixit has found something different with their iPhone 7 Plus. In the case of the larger phone, there is 3GB of RAM. Apple has never before equipped the Plus with more memory than the base model, so this is a first. And while there has always been some performance stratification between the two phones due to the Plus model’s larger size – allowing better heat dissipation, and therefore slightly better performance – I wonder if this means we’re going to see an increase in the stratification between the two phone models. If nothing else, I suspect this comes as a consequence of the Plus’s higher resolution screen: all other factors being held equal, the Plus needs a bit more RAM for its larger GPU frame buffers. Update: The Chipworks crew has their die shot and floor plan back, so let's take a look. As Apple already disclosed the number of GPU clusters, there's not a whole lot left to doubt in terms of basic construction.The GPU cores, SRAM caches, and the performance CPU cores are all easy enough to find, with the latter block now about 16mm2, versus 13mm2 in the A9. The big question here is where the two smaller, high-efficiency cores are. Chipworks postulates three thories: 1) They're in the same block as the high performance cores (and hence labeled as a quad core CPU), they're to the left of the die, or they're to the bottom left of the die. It is likely - but not guaranteed - that they're close to the high-performance cores. However both alternative locations do have pairs of identical blocks, which is what you'd be looking for in a secondary set of CPU cores. So although those options are less likely, without additional information it's difficult to rule out those options entirely. Finally, one interesting aspect of the Chipworks report is that they unexpectedly found a third audio amplifier. Chipworks was expecting to find two – one for each of the speakers – but came up with a third. The firm believes that the third amp may be for headphones, which in turn would mean that Apple has significantly revised the Lightning port specification for the iPhone 7. Previously Lightning has only carried digital audio, which doesn’t require an amp in the phone itself. In the initial iPhone 7 announcement I had speculated that Apple put the DAC (and amp) inside their 3.5mm adapter – which would be consistent with how Lightning has worked over the last 4 years – but this casts doubt on that idea. If Apple has revised the specification to allow analog audio over the port, then this greatly simplifies how headphones and adapters will work. But it also would raise a number of questions about peripheral compatibility, especially what happens if you plug something like the Lightning EarPods into an older device like the iPhone 5s. On that note, the Chipworks and iFixit teardowns also show us what’s gone in the place of the now-absent headphone jack: Apple has placed a taptic engine (linear actuator) for the solid state home button, and an unusual plastic bumper. Wrapping things up, Chipworks’ reports that they already have the A10 SoC in their lab for further work, including confirming the manufacturing process and, of course, a die shot. The latter should prove to be very interesting, as it will be the first look we get at Apple’s new high-efficiency CPU cores. And in the meantime on our end we also have our iPhone samples in-house, so we’re diligently working on putting together a review for later this month. So be sure to stay tuned for that.

POST A COMMENT 96 Comments View All Comments Synomenon - Friday, September 16, 2016 - link Interested to see whether the 7 and 7 Plus have the same camera sensor for the main camera. There were people posting before that the 7 had a slightly larger sensor for its camera than the 7 Plus. Reply Samus - Friday, September 16, 2016 - link Also interesting about the DAC for the lightning port. Makes me feel a little different about the whole 3.5mm jack being removed, but still kind of turned off none the less. I use square to take credit cards for my business, a digital 3.5mm thermometer when I travel, and occasionally a micro boom 3.5mm microphone when recording video of my daughter playing hockey, etc. I guess the revised lightning port to emulate a 3.5mm jack explains why all these accessories, at least according to square and some other manufactures, continue to work even with the adapter, because the adapter isn't really emulating anything it's just bringing the signal down from the port... Reply thope - Friday, September 16, 2016 - link looks like lightning port was highly programmable. just tried with 5C and audio dongle. On IOS 9 i get and error saying accessory not supported and in iOS 10 it works. I have compared the sound and it seems identical on both the jack and the adapter. Reply Constructor - Saturday, September 17, 2016 - link And that is why it needs to contain a DAC in the adapter. It could not work with the old devices otherwise, which have always required peripheral DACs for Lightning audio. And, wouldn't you know, Cirrus has just the exactly matching special chip for precisely this purpose, namely interfacing with Lightning on one side and headphones on the other (it's also almost certainly built into the Lightning earbuds): http://www.cirrus.com/en/applications/app/detail/A... Reply Constructor - Saturday, September 17, 2016 - link So when will anybody finally crack their Lightning adapter open to check? iFixit hasn't bothered, which is a severe omission. Reply londedoganet - Tuesday, September 20, 2016 - link Good news: A Vietnamese site known for its iPhone leaks has torn one apart. Spoiler: There's a DAC from Cirrus Logic inside the adapter, exactly as you said, because of course there was, and everyone else theorizing about secret changes to the Lightning specification was just being silly. Link: http://www.macrumors.com/2016/09/20/lightning-earp... Reply Constructor - Wednesday, September 21, 2016 - link Well, at least very speculative... But it was an interesting theory nevertheless! Reply thope - Monday, September 19, 2016 - link You are forgetting that lightning headphones always worked with iPhone 5/5c. If the adapter had a dac it would not matter if the software was iOS 9/10. I am convinced that lightning port always had the capability to send analog audio. I am sure the cable has apples authentication chip to inform the phone of what accessory is connected. Also, Given the size of the adapter it is highly unlikely that there is a dac in there. Also, there is still a cirrus headphone amp/dac present onboard. I have the audeze sine cipher cable and it has an active dac. The remote part itself is much bigger that the dongle. Reply Constructor - Wednesday, September 21, 2016 - link It just has to be a new kind of device with special driver needs even while it's similar to existing ones in order to require an iOS upgrade, and it looks as if it's just that. Reply HunterKlynn - Friday, September 16, 2016 - link Phil Schiller explicitly said they're identical, so I'd be surprised if they're not.

By Natalie Gagliordi for Between the Lines | September 16, 2016 -- 13:54 GMT (06:54 PDT) | Topic: PCs Intel headquarters in Santa Clara, California. iStock Demand for PCs has been stagnant at best, but Intel thinks a turnaround is on the horizon. What's Hot on ZDNet Nothing good is free: How Linux and open source companies make money Could Trump be the catalyst for an all-American iPhone? Women's share of Microsoft jobs falls again, so it's tying top pay to diversity Britain has passed the 'most extreme surveillance law ever passed in a democracy' The chipmaker on Friday raised its third quarter revenue outlook, saying the increase was "primarily driven by replenishment of PC supply chain inventory." Intel says it's also seeing "some signs of improving PC demand." Intel now expects Q3 revenue of $15.6 billion, up from the previously guided $14.9 billion. Expenses from research and development and mergers and acquisitions are projected to be $5.2 billion, an increase of $100 million from the prior expectation. Intel also shifted its gains and losses, saying it now expects a Q3 net loss of approximately $125 million, up from the previous forecast of $75 million. Despite its newfound PC optimism, most of Intel's investments as of late have been focused on enterprise infrastructure. Earlier this year the tech giant announced plans to cut 12,000 jobs -- or nearly 11 percent of its workforce -- as part of a major restructure prompted by the decline in PC sales and other hardware. At the time, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he believed Intel could transform from a PC company to "a company that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices" by focusing on technology for connected things, memory, connectivity, Moore's Law, and cloud. Last quarter, however, revenue across Intel's key business units was relatively weak, including in its data center group and Internet of Things (IoT) group. The data center group had revenue of $4 billion, up 1 percent sequentially and up 5 percent year-over-year. Intel's IoT group posted revenue of $572 million, down 12 percent sequentially and up just 2 percent year-over-year.

In this piece Ken Stewart, Chief Wireless Technologist, Mobile Communications Group, Intel Fellow at Intel Corporation makes the case for NB-IoT. The 5G era is upon us. An era where every person, thing, and use case will be enabled with both seamless connectivity and massive computing power for the very first time, transforming the way we interact with our world. In her recent blog titled “The 5G Era: The Machines are Coming,” VP of Intel’s Communication and Devices Group, Aicha Evans, noted that “Today’s mobile world was built for smartphones with voice and data in mind. In tomorrow’s world, nothing is mobile because everything is mobile.” Likewise, in tomorrow’s world, a device will no longer be just a device, but rather one of billions of nodes, communicating via an intelligent network that surrounds us. Any “thing” connected will be a gateway to a virtually unlimited range of new capabilities and experiences, powered by rapid and ubiquitous access to the cloud. From self-driving cars, drones and robots, to wearable devices, to sensors embedded in virtually everything—by 2020 more than 50 billion connected devices will be in use, making our homes, our cities, and our lives richer and smarter. As we speed toward 2020, we must start to connect “things” now, allowing them to become greater than the sum of their parts. Narrowband IoT (NB-IOT) is the the pacesetting radio technology standardised by the 3GPP standards body, which delivers Low Power Wide Area access (LPWA) to a new generation of connected things in the race to 5G. With NB-IOT, the future starts now. Leading operators and equipment manufacturers are already showcasing real world demonstration of the technology. NB-IOT offers important technical benefits that will accelerate 5G innovation. It is a core technology necessary to meet the cost, battery life, and wide area coverage required of massive IoT. With spectrum in limited supply, 5G mobile networks must become more agile—delivering the right amount of data, at the right rate, over the right air interface, within the right area, to the right device, in the most efficient way possible. Supporting the aggressive goals of 5G will require tapping into new licensed bands and exploring new ways to use new and existing unlicensed spectrum bands to meet data demands. NB-IOT allows small form factor devices and sensors to connect efficiently to licensed spectrum of narrow bandwidth (180 kHz), mitigating growing network load in the valuable and scarce cellular bands, while also improving network capacity and spectrum efficiency. It also allows manufacturers and carriers to substantially reuse existing network and device technologies—deploying within a legacy LTE carrier, in the guard band, or stand-alone. Another advantage of NB-IOT is that it also supports deep indoor and wide area coverage (with a coverage extension of 10-20dB over existing technologies), with low device complexity and power consumption. These are important factors to consider when planning for rural as well as urban sensor-based applications. Smart devices accessing the network via NB-IOT are expected to launch in late 2016/2017 with a battery life of more than 10 years. Why does all of this matter? NB-IOT eases entry for a variety of new products and use cases. Mobile operators can embrace emerging devices and technologies, creating new lines of revenue without stressing their network resources to the point of degrading the quality of traditional services. Manufacturers can develop solutions at massive scale for consumer, agricultural, industrial, metropolitan and governmental applications at affordable price points, speeding adoption. Equally importantly, NB-IOT provides insight on what the “things of the future” will be, what they will do, and how they will shape our lives—while also helping us chart the path forward. And it gives the industry the time it needs to figure out the standards and technologies that will comprise the multi-faceted 5G “network of all networks.” Tags: featured, Intel, IOT, NB IoT Mobile Networks / IoT and M2M Smart IoT Internet of Things World Leave a comment Cancel reply Connect with: -or- Log in with your Telecoms.com account Alternatively, post a comment by completing the form below: Your email address will not be published.

At present, however, Intel still gets the largest share of its revenue from PC chips. Last quarter, its revenue from the "client" device business that includes PCs declined 3% from the year-earlier period.  Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Meanwhile, Intel has slashed head count to adjust to weaker sales growth and free up cash to invest in newer businesses.  Intel is set to report earnings for the September quarter on Oct. 18.  Write to Anne Steele at Anne.Steele@wsj.com Fox Business Markets Politics Features FBN TV About Fox Business Channel Finder Advertise With Us Jobs Internships New Terms of Use (What's new) New Privacy Policy FAQ Media Relations Closed Captioning Policy Accessibility Statement Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

Shares of the world's largest chipmaker rose as much as 4.1 percent to a more than 15-year high of $38.05 on Friday. Intel, which helped found the personal computer industry, has been struggling as tech users shift away from PCs to mobile phones for their computing needs. Sales in the company's PC business declined 3 percent to $7.3 billion in the latest quarter. The unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets. However, there have been signs PC demand may be recovering. HP Inc, which houses the hardware business of the former Hewlett-Packard Co, said last month that revenue in its computer business rose 7.5 percent in the third quarter from the second as sales of notebooks improved. FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi said commentary from Intel and HP suggested that PCs were "not as dead as people were thinking." Research firm IDC said in July global PC shipments fell less than expected in the second quarter, helped by strength in the United States. "We expect PC units to decline less than the high-single-digit decline consensus in 2017, driven by continued Windows 10 upgrades and accelerating SSD adoption, along with new form factors," Baird Equity Research analyst Tristan Gerra wrote, raising his price target to $42 from $40. Intel said on Friday it expected third-quarter revenue to be $15.6 billion, plus or minus $300 million, compared with its prior forecast of $14.9 billion, plus or minus $500 million. That implies the highest-ever quarterly revenue for Intel, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts on average were expecting $14.90 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said the pre-announcement was a good first step to the PC story stabilizing at Intel, and raised his price target by $2 to $38. Shares of rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc were up about 1 percent, while those of Micron Technology Inc and HP were marginally higher. Shares of Santa Clara, California-based Intel were up 2.6 percent at $37.53 in afternoon trading. Up to Thursday's close, the stock had risen 6.1 percent this year, underperforming the 20.8 percent gain in the broader Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index during the period.

As The Matrix’s Agent Smith put it to an overweening police lieutenant, "your men are already dead." We may be experiencing such a moment in the tech industry today, thanks to Apple’s exceptional new A10 Fusion chip, which threatens to devour a big chunk of Intel’s heretofore imperious silicon army. Now, before you accuse me of being high on my own metaphorical supply, I’m not saying that Intel will be crippled or surpassed anytime soon. But I am arguing that the chip giant is under a substantial threat, the likes of which it hasn’t faced for a long time, maybe ever. A quick look at the Geekbench scores attained by the iPhone 7 quantifies a staggering achievement: the single-core performance of Apple’s latest generation of smartphone processors has basically caught up with Intel’s laptops CPUs. The A10 chip inside the iPhone 7 comfortably outpaces its predecessors and Android rivals, and even outdoes a wide catalog of relatively recent Mac computers (including the not-so-recent Mac Pro). The iPhone’s notoriously hard to benchmark against anything else and this is just one metric, but it’s illustrative of Apple’s accelerating momentum and mobile focus. @gruber Grain of salt and all, but Geekbench has the iPhone 7 beating the $6500 12-core Mac Pro in single-thread. pic.twitter.com/DFQoULZ15G — Matt Mariska (@MattMariska) September 15, 2016 Intel has for many years been the undisputed champion of desktop and laptop processors running the x86 instruction set. Its sole competitor, AMD, hasn’t actually been competitive since around the turn of the century, and we have the Wintel portmanteau reminding us of the enduring dominance of Intel’s chips and Microsoft’s Windows OS in the years since. But many things have changed since the days of comparing AMD’s Thunderbird against Intel’s Pentium. The first thing — the one we’re all aware of, but never really adequately conscious of — is that the whole world is moving to mobile computing. This isn’t some slow transition off on the distant horizon like AI, it’s a thing happening right now. Advertisers are shifting their spending from desktop to mobile faster than they are pulling it out of print media, and people are buying smartphones at five times the rate that they’re acquiring new PCs. IDC’s 2015 figures show 1.43 billion smartphones shipped versus 276 million PCs. Apple by itself shipped more iPhones (74.8 million) in the last quarter of last year than the entire PC industry (71.9 million) managed to ship PCs. The predominant form of computing is already mobile It’s already the case, by sheer force of numbers, that Apple’s A series of mobile processors are at least as important and market-leading as Intel’s vast portfolio of x86 chips. But the present pseudo-equilibrium between them is being drastically upset by Apple’s leap in performance with the new A10 Fusion. By straying into the performance waters previously reserved for Intel’s laptop CPUs, Apple is teasing us with the question of why not inject the A10 (or its successors) into actual laptops? Why shouldn’t the next MacBook run on the same chip as the current iPhone? Granted, the MacBook’s macOS is based on x86 whereas the A chips all use the ARM architecture, but then an equally interesting question might be whether Apple shouldn’t just bite the bullet and make iOS its universal operating system. I think we’re past the point where ARM chips in Apple consumer desktops make sense. The only Q now is OS to run on it - shouldn’t be macOS — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) September 16, 2016 It sounds wild, but the A10 looks to have the power and efficiency to handle the workload of a full PC. This coalescence of mobile and desktop PCs is driven by forces on both sides: mobile chips are getting more potent at the same time as our power needs are shrinking and our tasks become more mobile. If you think your workplace isn’t changing much because there are a bunch of weathered Dell workstations sitting next to frumpy HP printers, consider just how much more work every one of your officemates is doing outside the office, on their phone. And all those grand and power-hungry x86 applications that might have kept people running macOS — Adobe’s Photoshop and Lightroom being two key examples — well, they’re being ported to iOS in almost their full functionality, having been incentivized by the existence of Apple’s iPad Pro line, last year’s harbinger for this year’s performance jump. Unlike Windows, whose x86 reliance is tied to its dominance of the lucrative PC gaming market, Apple really has very few anchors locking it down to macOS. The Cupertino company has been investing the vast majority of its development time into the mobile iOS for years now, and that shows in the different rates of progress between its two pieces of software. macOS is, in many ways, legacy software just waiting for the right moment to be deprecated. It’s getting a fresh lick of paint now and then, but most of its novelties now relate to how it links back to Apple’s core iOS and iPhone business. Intel will continue to dominate the high end, but that market is small and shrinking It’s difficult for those of my generation — people who grew up with the beige PC box as a cultish object of desire and the symbol of cutting-edge computing — to understand just how divorced the modern world and population have become from the desktop PC. The desktop today is akin to what mainframes were in the past: an imposing, burring, gargantuan construction that you only resort to when you really need to get some heavy work done. There will always be room for Intel’s dominance to persist. As workloads increase in size and complexity, the opportunities to turn them into parallel tasks improve, and that’s where machines like the 12-core Mac Pro will handily outdo the iPhone 7. Of course. You can also strap massive graphics cards and massive amounts of RAM onto a tower PC, and you won’t have to worry about limitations of storage either. But the market for such high-end power is small and shrinking. Our video production needs today are better characterized by Snapchat Live Stories than Adobe Premiere Pro. It is simply a matter of time Intel already let Apple down once with the original MacBook’s underpowered Core M processor, and the absence of an Intel Skylake upgrade for either the MacBook Pro or Air this year also seems to have been caused by Apple’s dissatisfaction with Intel’s CPUs. There is nothing that Apple would like to do more than rid itself of its reliance on Intel, which would eliminate such unforeseen hiccups in the future. Apple is famous for its vertical integration, owning and controlling every possible aspect of its supply and production chain, and switching to its own processor chips across all devices would be the next logical improvement in that integration. If you want to develop the next great processor, you’d better be going mobile first and building from there. Intel’s decades of futile attempts to shrink desktop chips into mobile devices have shown how not to do things. Now Apple’s persistent and apparently accelerating performance improvement with the A series suggests it might have found the right path through. It’s fitting that this new chip is called A10 Fusion, because the path it’s leading us on will eventually lead to the merging of what we now consider two distinct classes of mobile and desktop PCs.

ARB_ES3_2_compatibility Turned On For Intel Broadwell And Newer Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 16 September 2016 at 07:01 AM EDT. 7 Comments The Intel Mesa OpenGL driver now exposes the ARB_ES3_2_compatibility extension. The Intel i965 Mesa DRI driver has already supported the necessary extensions for OpenGL ES 3.2 support while this ARB_ES3_2_compatibility extension signifies that features found in GLES 3.2 but missing from OpenGL 4.5 are present in the desktop GL driver. This extension makes it easier for bringing mobile OpenGL ES programs to the desktop. So with a straight-forward commit, the extension is now flipped on for Intel hardware of the Broadwell "Gen 8" era and newer. The Intel OpenGL driver still isn't officially exposing OpenGL 4.5 support (although the necessary extensions are complete) until some final test-cases are resolved. The Nouveau NVC0 and RadeonSI Gallium3D drivers remain a few extensions short of GL 4.4 and GL 4.5. These Gallium3D drivers also are several extensions out from OpenGL ES 3.2 compliance. 7 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus teardown confirms bigger battery, Intel LTE modem in some models and more Apple iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus smartphones went on sale today in over 25 countries. As usual, folks at iFixit have already managed to grab a iPhone 7 Plus from Japan and have given at a teardown treatment. Even though they are yet to teardown the iPhone 7, teardown by research firm Chipworks reveals all the internals that Apple doesn’t mention in the spec sheet. The main thing these teardowns confirm is the presence of Intel’s LTE modem in some units. iFixit’s iPhone 7 Plus unit from Japan has the model number A1785 and supports CDMA networks. It has Qualcomm MDM9645M LTE Cat. 12 Modem that offers download speed of up to 450 Mbps, compared to Qualcomm MDM9635M LTE Cat. 6 modem in the iPhone 6 and 6s Plus phones. The iPhone 7 Plus from Chipworks is U.S. unit with the model number A1778 and support for GSM networks. This has PMB9943 modem, two PMB5750 transceivers and the PMB6826 power management IC, so this could have Intel XMM7360 modem, as rumored. Apple already confirmed through the official site that models A1778 and A1784 do not support CDMA networks used by Verizon and Sprint. It is not still not clear if all the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus CDMA models will use Qualcomm chips and others without CDMA support will use Intel chip. We will find out if someone does a teardown of A1660 and A1661 models of iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, respectively. Both the phones have Apple A10 Fusion (APL1W24) SoC and the space below the display that had 3.5mm audio jack is now replaced by Taptic Engine for the new pressure-sensitive Home button. The iPhone 7 has Samsung 2GB LPDDR4 RAM (K3RG1G10CM) memory and Toshiba 128 GB NAND Flash (THGBX6T0T8LLFXE) storage. It has 1960 mAh battery, compared to 1715mAh battery in the iPhone 6s and 1810mAh  battery in the iPhone 6. The iPhone 7 Plus has Samsung 3GB LPDDR4 RAM (K3RG4G40MM-YGCH) and Toshiba 128 GB NAND Flash (THGBX6T0T8LLFXF). It has 2,900 mAh battery, compared to 2,750 mAh battery in the iPhone 6s Plus and it is slightly smaller than the 2915mAh battery in the iPhone 6 Plus. These phones have IP67 ratings for water resistance, so these have strong adhesive to offer better water resistance, including rubber gasket for lightning port, capable of holding back a 50 meter column of water. The plastic SIM eject plug and SIM tray also have a rubber gasket to protect the phone from dust and water.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Intel Corp raised its quarterly revenue forecast for the first time in more than two years as suppliers of parts used in personal computers replenish their inventory amid improving PC demand. Shares of the world’s largest chipmaker rose as much as 4.1 per cent to a more than 15-year high of US$38.05 on Friday. Intel, which helped found the personal computer industry, has been struggling as tech users shift away from PCs to mobile phones for their computing needs. Sales in the company’s PC business declined 3 per cent to US$7.3 billion in the latest quarter. The unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets. Related ‘More pain to come’: As technology shifts, additional layoffs loom at tech companies Intel Corp scores major mobile win after securing chip deal for Apple Inc’s new iPhone: sources However, there have been signs PC demand may be recovering. HP Inc, which houses the hardware business of the former Hewlett-Packard Co, said last month that revenue in its computer business rose 7.5 per cent in the third quarter from the second as sales of notebooks improved. FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi said commentary from Intel and HP suggested that PCs were “not as dead as people were thinking.” Research firm IDC said in July global PC shipments fell less than expected in the second quarter, helped by strength in the United States. “We expect PC units to decline less than the high-single-digit decline consensus in 2017, driven by continued Windows 10 upgrades and accelerating SSD adoption, along with new form factors,” Baird Equity Research analyst Tristan Gerra wrote, raising his price target to US$42 from US$40. Intel said on Friday it expected third-quarter revenue to be US$15.6 billion, plus or minus US$300 million, compared with its prior forecast of US$14.9 billion, plus or minus US$500 million. That implies the highest-ever quarterly revenue for Intel, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts on average were expecting US$14.90 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said the pre-announcement was a good first step to the PC story stabilizing at Intel, and raised his price target by US$2 to US$38. Shares of rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc were up about 1 per cent, while those of Micron Technology Inc and HP were marginally higher. Shares of Santa Clara, California-based Intel were up 2.6 per cent at US$37.53 in afternoon trading. Up to Thursday’s close, the stock had risen 6.1 per cent this year, underperforming the 20.8 per cent gain in the broader Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index during the period. © Thomson Reuters 2016 Find Financial Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Typo?

The world’s largest maker of semiconductors has been suffering from a global slide in demand for PCs because people increasingly prefer their tablets or mobile phones. Now, Intel is seeing signs of “replenishment of PC supply chain inventory,” indicating that PC makers are stocking up on key components for computers after years of sliding sales that left hardware gathering dust on shelves. It is also “seeing some signs of improving PC demand,” the company said in a statement on Friday. Intel chief executive officer Brian Krzanich is looking for new ways to fuel growth in areas such as drones, robots and everyday items like connected air-conditioners, while still depending on its traditional businesses, including products that power PCs and mobile phones. In addition to the PC gains, the company’s forecast indicates Intel might be benefiting from chips that are now being placed in some of Apple Inc’s iPhones, according to Timothy Arcuri, an analyst with Cowen & Co. “They also had this iPhone stuff in their back pocket, which is now coming through,” Arcuri said. “I do think PCs are better — there’s enough data points to suggest that — but it’s not just PCs.” Intel shares rose 3 percent to US$37.67 at the close in New York, the biggest single-day jump in about nine months and the highest value since December 2014. The stock has gained 9.3 percent this year. Intel’s new forecast is for revenue of US$15.6 billion, plus or minus US$300 million. The previous projection from the Santa Clara, California-based company was US$14.9 billion, plus or minus US$500 million. Analysts on average had estimates in line with the company’s original outlook. Intel also boosted its forecast for adjusted gross margin by one point, now expecting the midpoint at 63 percent, plus or minus a couple of percentage points. Shipments of PCs, a market that provides Intel with more than half of its sales, fell to their lowest level in a decade in the first three months of this year. However, by the second quarter, the rate of decline in PC shipments had slowed, as demand in North America helped blunt weakness across the rest of the industry. Some analysts were hesitant to call this a turnaround yet. “PCs are doing better, no doubt about it,” said C.J. Muse, an analyst at Evercore ISI. “I wouldn’t call it rapid change. I think when you look at depleted inventory in the channel plus the pessimistic attitude coming in, we were set up for things to come in a little better than expectations.” This story has been viewed 1723 times.

"Out of Intel's power requirement of 4MW, 2.5MW is produced using fuel cell based technology using Natural Gas developed by Bloom Energy," Pradhan tweeted following a visit to the Intel R&D centre here. "Visited Intel R&D centre in Bengaluru. The $12 Billion facility is one of the three such facilities in the world," he said. Last month, state-run gas utility GAIL (India) and US-based Bloom Energy signed an agreement to deploy revolutionary natural gas-based fuel cell technology to generate electricity. Gas is already being supplied by GAIL for energising a multi-megawatt Bloom Energy project at the Technology Park here. The technology is currently being used by over 100 of the Fortune 500 companies that are diversified majors in IT, Telecom, retailing, e-commerce and consumer goods. Bloom Energy's solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology converts fuel into electricity using natural gas as the base fuel in a highly efficient non-combustible process that reduces emissions of greenhouse gas and harmful air pollutants, and with minimal use of water. "GAIL is supplying PNG for this to Bloom under an MoU. This Green Energy with no noise & minimal water intake can replace diesel based gensets," Pradhan said in a separate tweet. The minimal use of water is a major consideration here in India's major IT hub, which has witnessed violent street protests this week provoked by the court-mandated release of Cauvery water to neighbouring Tamil Nadu. "Fuel cells can use biogas generated from biomass in rural areas & from municipal wastes in the cities to generate cost-effective green energy," he said "There is a need for promoting this technology. With scale the cost of this will become affordable for common & domestic consumers as well," Pradhan added in another tweet. He also visited the LPG Equipment Research Centre (LERC) here that specialises in testing various liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) equipment. "Asked LERC to think out of box; put consumer convenience on top priority & adopt suggestions given by industry experts & innovators," he tweeted after the LERC visit. "Startups have a great role to play with innovations in making LPG more environment friendly by enhancing efficiency & reducing emissions," he said in another tweet. --IANS bc/ask/bg SEARCH About Us Data Center Cloud Computing Servers Cloud Applications Hosting MPLS VPN Network Services Disclaimer Privacy Policy Careers Feedback Advertise Digital © Copyright Sify Technologies Ltd, 1998-2016.

Source: Chipworks Chipworks performed a teardown of the iPhone7 which did not stop at just taking the unit apart. The teardown goes even further into the specific chips used in the A1778 iPhone 7 model which they have gotten their hands on. This model is used on AT&T or T-Mobile and other GSM networks. Its not known (but likely) that the CDMA variants connecting to Sprint or Verizon stuck to Qualcomm for their modems. An entire mobile cellular platform was found in the iPhone 7 including a modem (with model number XMM7360), two RF transceivers, and a power management integrated circuit. If you wish to get into the nitty gritty of the chips and their descriptions, you can head over to the source link below. Chipworks says it will get a Verizon unit and confirm whether or not the CDMA variant also makes use of these Intel chips.

Changes throughout) * Deutsche fine risk weighs on bank stocks * Oracle drops, Intel rises on contrasting forecasts * Quadruple witching day likely to lead to volatility * Indexes down: Dow 0.40 pct, S&P 0.47 pct, Nasdaq 0.27 pct By Yashaswini Swamynathan Sept 16 Wall Street was near session lows late on Friday morning as Oracle led a decline in tech stocks and financials came under pressure on the possibility that Deutsche Bank could face a $14 billion fine. The settlement proposal, made during negotiations between the U.S. Department of Justice and Deutsche Bank over claims that the German bank missold mortgage-backed securities, was larger than expected. Deutsche's U.S.-listed shares were down 9.2 percent. Dow components Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan fell 1.2 percent each. The S&P 500 financial index dropped 0.98 percent, the steepest among the 10 major S&P sectors. The KBW Bank index fell 1.25 percent, putting it on track for its biggest weekly decline since the Brexit vote in late June. Traders have all but ruled out the possibility of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates at its meeting that starts next Tuesday. But, investors will carefully parse the Fed's comments on the recent sluggish economic data and its impact on when the central bank will eventually pull the trigger. At 10:57 a.m. ET (1457 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 72.62 points, or 0.4 percent, at 18,139.86. The S&P 500 was down 10.01 points, or 0.47 percent, at 2,137.25. The Nasdaq Composite was down 14.19 points, or 0.27 percent, at 5,235.50. Oracle dropped 3.9 percent and pulled down other technology stocks after the company issued a disappointing quarterly profit. Also weighing was a 0.5 percent drop in Apple, that was set to snap a four-day winning streak, as Asia gave the iPhone 7 a subdued welcome. Helping limit losses was Intel's 2.5 percent gain after the chipmaker raised its third-quarter revenue forecast. The CBOE Market Volatility index was up 0.61 percent. The index, commonly called Wall Street's "fear gauge", has fallen only twice this week. Volatility was likely rise as investors unwind interests in futures and options contracts prior to expiration - a process known as quadruple witching. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,033 to 809. On the Nasdaq, 1,531 issues fell and 1,121 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed three new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 49 new highs and 27 new lows.

The settlement proposal, made during negotiations between the U.S. Department of Justice and Deutsche Bank over claims that the German bank missold mortgage-backed securities, was larger than expected. Deutsche's U.S.-listed shares were down 9 percent. Dow components Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan fell 1 percent each. The S&P 500 financial index dropped 1.01 percent, the biggest among the 10 major S&P sectors. The energy index was a close second, declining 0.94 percent as oil prices fell 2.2 percent on worries of oversupply. At 9:39 a.m. ET (1339 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was down 90.12 points, or 0.49 percent, at 18,122.36. The S&P 500 was down 10.13 points, or 0.47 percent, at 2,137.13. All the benchmark's major sectors were lower. The Nasdaq Composite was down 14.61 points, or 0.28 percent, at 5,235.08. Helping the tech-heavy index was Intel's 3.14 percent gain after the chipmaker raised its third-quarter revenue forecast. However, Oracle was a drag, dropping 2.72 percent to $39.75 after it issued a disappointing quarterly profit. Investors also await the Federal Reserve's meeting starting next Tuesday. While traders have very low expectations of an interest rate hike, investors will be keen for commentary on how the central bank views on the recent sluggish economic data. The data and contrasting comments from Fed officials on rate hikes have caused the markets to oscillate and volatility to spike in the past few days. "Like it has been before, Mr. Market gets it right in the long term but tends to over react in the short term, and that's what we have seen all this week," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Volatility may rise again on as Friday, which marks the quadruple witching day when investors unwind interests in futures and options contracts prior to expiration. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,980 to 685. On the Nasdaq, 1,452 issues fell and 830 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed three new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 27 new highs and 13 new lows.

The House report “is so artlessly distorted that it would be amusing if it weren't such a serious act of bad faith,” said a tweet posted by the fugitive former NSA contractor, who then proceeded to offer “examples.” @Snowden Their report is so artlessly distorted that it would be amusing if it weren't such a serious act of bad faith. Let's take examples:— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 15, 2016 Snowden, who has been at an undisclosed location in Russia for the past three years, took umbrage at perceived attacks on his personal integrity, such as the assertion that he “claimed to have left Army basic training because of broken legs when in fact he washed out because of shin splints.” “Army held me for weeks in a special unit for convalescence before separation. I left on crutches. They don't do that for ‘shin splints,’” wrote the 33-year-old, who volunteered in 2004, saying he wanted to fight in Iraq. Snowden described as “amazing” the accusation that he had “doctored his performance evaluations and obtained new positions at NSA by exaggerating his resume and stealing the answers to an employment test,” likely by searching through data on his colleagues’ hard drives. “I reported an XSS (hacking) vulnerability in CIA annual review system,” explains Snowden. The claim I "doctored performance evaluations?" This one is amazing: I reported an XSS (hacking) vulnerability in CIA annual review system.— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 15, 2016 The report also claims that Snowden shared over 1.5 million files, the “vast majority” of which “have nothing to do with programs impacting individual privacy interests – they instead pertain to military, defense and intelligence programs of great interest to America’s adversaries.” It also states that this began to happen eight months before the 2013 Senate testimony from Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, which purportedly prompted Snowden to go rogue, in disgust at his boss’s prevarication. @Snowden The claim I exfiltrated data for journos 8 months prior to Clapper? False. That was HEARTBEAT (see film), an approved data handler.— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 15, 2016 @Snowden HEARTBEAT, which seems to be the source of their 1.5m number, was explicited authorized by two levels of my management. I built it.— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 15, 2016 The whistleblower explains that the number of files and the date pertain to HEARTBEAT, a program Snowden says he “built” to handle data, which “was explicitly authorized by two levels of my management.” Read more House urges Obama not to pardon Snowden, claims he is ‘not a whistleblower’ “The committee seems to intentionally conflate my authorized government work with my unauthorized whistleblowing. Diminishes them,” tweeted Snowden, who says he no longer has private access to any of the documents he leaked. Snowden also contests the claim that “the deputy chairman of the Russian parliament’s defense and security committee publicly conceded that ‘Snowden did share intelligence’ with his government.” Snowden says that the politician in question, Franz Klintsevich, prefaced the statement with “Ya dumayu” (“I think”) and was merely expressing an opinion, which the former NSA employee says is “speculation presented as fact.” Snowden says that he “could go on,” but instead condemns the report outright, and urges people to watch the Oliver Stone film about his final months at the NSA, and his leak, which comes out this week. “Bottom line: after ‘two years of investigation,’ the American people deserve better. This report diminishes the committee,” tweeted Snowden. The report also painted him as a “serial exaggerator and fabricator” who decided to lash out against his colleagues following a “workplace spat,” after he was reprimanded multiple times and failed to pass yearly NSA tests, which he claimed were “rigged.” Snowden said his legitimate complaints were punished by superiors. @Snowden Claim: I reported a critical problem (software updates taking field sites offline) to senior management, and was reprimanded. True!— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 15, 2016 Snowden has publicly asked for a full presidential pardon, in the past week, citing concern for ordinary spied-on Americans as his motive, but according to the House, his actions made him a "traitor." “The US Government has spent hundreds of millions of dollars and will eventually spend billions, to attempt to mitigate the damage Snowden caused,” said the authors, who have published a three-page summary of the classified document, which runs to 36 pages.

(NASDAQ: INTC) shares saw a handy gain to close out the week after the company raised guidance for its third quarter. This increase is primarily driven by replenishment of personal computer (PC) supply chain inventory. Intel is also seeing some signs of improving PC demand. The company now expects third-quarter revenue to be $15.6 billion, give or take $300 million, versus the previous estimate of $14.9 billion, plus or minus $500 million. The consensus estimates from Thomson Reuters are calling for $0.66 in earnings per share (EPS) on $14.9 billion in revenue for the current quarter. Intel also forecast the midpoint of the third-quarter gross margin range at roughly 63%, which is up 1% from the same period last year, driven mostly by higher PC unit volume. Third-quarter research and development plus marketing, general and administrative spending is expected to be approximately $5.2 billion, up from the prior expectation of approximately $5.1 billion. Third-quarter gains and losses from equity investments and interest and other income are expected to be a net loss of roughly $125 million, as compared to the prior expectation of a net loss of approximately $75 million. Keep in mind that just a few days ago Standard & Poor’s noted that there was more upside likely for the semiconductor sales, despite the large sector gains that have been seen. The firm said: Semiconductors were a driving force in upward revisions to Q3 and Q4 technology earnings estimates and the semiconductor stocks were rewarded (+11.5% since the start of July). From a valuation perspective, the semiconductors trade at a 33% discount to its ten year average despite the recent price appreciation. At a 15.1x price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) on a next-twelve-month basis, it is trading at a more attractive valuation than the technology sector, which has a P/E of 17.1x. We believe that several opportunities remain within technology and specifically semiconductors. Demand for semiconductors is normally a sign of economic growth. As the economy and consumer continues to improve, so should the business prospects (and the stocks of) for companies comprising this sub-industry. Excluding Friday’s move, Intel had outperformed the broad markets, with the stock up nearly 9% year to date. Over the past 52 weeks, the stock is up 27%. Shares of Intel were last seen up more than 5% for the week to $37.35. The consensus analyst price target is $37.97, and the 52-week trading range is $27.68 to $38.05.

The Santa Clara-based company said it now expects third quarter revenue of $15.6 billion, plus or minus $300 million. That’s up from a prior forecast of $14.9 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Intel noted the change is mostly due to “replenishment of PC supply chain inventory” amid “some signs of improving PC demand.” From the press release: The company is forecasting the mid-point of the third-quarter GAAP gross margin range at 62 percent, plus or minus a couple of points, up 2 points versus the prior third-quarter GAAP outlook gross margin midpoint of 60 percent, driven mostly by higher PC unit volume. The midpoint of the third-quarter non-GAAP gross margin range is now forecasted at 63 percent, plus or minus a couple of points, up 1 point versus the prior third-quarter non-GAAP outlook gross margin midpoint of 62 percent. All other expectations have been withdrawn and guidance will be updated with the company’s third-quarter earnings report on Oct. 18. The world’s largest chipmaker, Intel has expanded its offerings in recent years amid the explosion of mobile platforms and tepid PC sales growth. The company now derives nearly half its revenues from non-computer processor businesses like cloud computing, security, Internet of Things, and more. Intel shares rose $1.02 (+2.79%) to $37.58 in Friday morning trading. INTC has now gained 9.42% year-to-date, versus a 4.49% rise in the S&P 500 during the same period.

REUTERS/Tyrone Siu By Narottam Medhora Intel Corp (INTC.O) raised its quarterly revenue forecast for the first time in more than two years as suppliers of parts used in personal computers replenish their inventory amid improving PC demand. Shares of the world's largest chipmaker rose as much as 4.1 percent to a more than 15-year high of $38.05 on Friday. Intel, which helped found the personal computer industry, has been struggling as tech users shift away from PCs to mobile phones for their computing needs. Sales in the company's PC business declined 3 percent to $7.3 billion in the latest quarter. The unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets. However, there have been signs PC demand may be recovering. HP Inc (HPQ.N), which houses the hardware business of the former Hewlett-Packard Co, said last month that revenue in its computer business rose 7.5 percent in the third quarter from the second as sales of notebooks improved. FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi said commentary from Intel and HP suggested that PCs were "not as dead as people were thinking." Research firm IDC said in July global PC shipments fell less than expected in the second quarter, helped by strength in the United States. "We expect PC units to decline less than the high-single-digit decline consensus in 2017, driven by continued Windows 10 upgrades and accelerating SSD adoption, along with new form factors," Baird Equity Research analyst Tristan Gerra wrote, raising his price target to $42 from $40. Intel said on Friday it expected third-quarter revenue to be $15.6 billion, plus or minus $300 million, compared with its prior forecast of $14.9 billion, plus or minus $500 million. That implies the highest-ever quarterly revenue for Intel, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts on average were expecting $14.90 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said the pre-announcement was a good first step to the PC story stabilizing at Intel, and raised his price target by $2 to $38. Shares of rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) were up about 1 percent, while those of Micron Technology Inc (MU.O) and HP were marginally higher. Shares of Santa Clara, California-based Intel were up 2.6 percent at $37.53 in afternoon trading. Up to Thursday's close, the stock had risen 6.1 percent this year, underperforming the 20.8 percent gain in the broader Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index .SOX during the period.

It packs a slick metal and carbon fiber chassis, a beautiful near-bezel-free display, and more than enough battery life for everyday usage. Today, Dell has updated the XPS 13 for 2016 with all the latest hardware. The biggest upgrade to the new XPS 13 is, as you might expect, Intel's Kaby Lake processors. The XPS 13 will come in three variants, packing either the Core i3-7100U, Core i5-7200U, or Core i7-7500U depending on the price point. All of these CPUs are 15W low-power parts with respectable performance and efficiency gains over Skylake. With the upgrade to Kaby Lake and a slightly larger 60 Wh battery, the 2016 XPS 13 boasts up to 22 hours of battery life if you opt for the 1080p panel. As with previous models, the QHD+ variant comes with a significant battery penalty: Dell only claims 13 hours of life for the high-resolution model. The only other notable change is the switch from Intel and Dell wireless controllers to a solution from Killer. This is possibly due to issues that Dell experienced with the wireless cards in previous models of the XPS 13, as the feature set of the Killer solution – Wi-Fi ac with 2x2 MIMO and Bluetooth 4.1 – is identical to past models. Other key specs have remained the same on the XPS 13, including a single Thunderbolt 3 USB Type-C port, up to 1 TB PCIe solid state drives, and up to 16 GB of memory. The new laptops will be available on October 4th starting at $799, in silver, gold, and a new rose gold color.

By Angelica Mari for Brazil Tech | September 16, 2016 -- 11:28 GMT (04:28 PDT) | Topic: CXO Intel has appointed Mauricio Ruiz as the new head of its Brazil operations as part of a corporate reorganization process. Ruiz replaces Colombian executive David González -- who held the position for two years and is now moving on to a different leadership role in a new venture within the company, in the United States. Read this Intel invests $50m in quantum computing effort Intel is the latest technology giant to invest in quantum computing research. Quantum computing, years away from commercialization, is supposed to be a huge leap forward. Read More The new head will be continuing the work carried out by Gonzalez around areas such as the development of an innovation ecosystem and will also reinforce a new positioning of Intel as an innovation agent for the local market. "We will continue focusing on stimulating the local ecosystem, its manufacturers, channels, and partners, and to ensure that advanced technologies reach the Brazilian market as quickly as possible," said Ruiz. "Even though we are experiencing a scenario that is a bit more challenging, local organizations continue to demand technology, local consumers have a proven appetite for innovation and disruption and we cannot forget our role in the debate about how technology can help solve local infrastructure problems," he adds. Ruiz is an Intel veteran, with 17 years of experience within the company in areas from engineering and solution architecture to leading the firm's corporate division and sales.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Announcement  ⋮  Mobile Dell XPS 13 Gets Updated to Run Kaby Lake Processors and Comes in Everybody’s Favorite Color By Omar Sohail Posted 2 months ago 37Shares Share Tweet Submit Intel Kaby Lake processors have appeared inside Dell’s XPS 13 refresh and guess what? In addition to sporting a new processor lineup, the notebook family is also available to purchase in everybody’s favorite color to talk about. Can you guess that color? You Can Choose Between a 1080p or a 4K Display for the XPS 13 Series and It Comes in the Rose Gold Model Too Rose Gold models are becoming quite popular and for the new XPS 13 series, you can choose between a 1080p display or a 4K panel. However, the outcome when it comes to battery life is going to be miles apart. According to Dell, the 1080p display variant will be able to deliver up 22 hours of battery life, while the 4K version will be able to deliver up to 13 hours of battery life. As a personal opinion, I’d honestly go for something that would provide me with a longer battery, especially when I am gone for long journeys, making the 1080p version the perfect addition. What’s more is that this version is going to be cheaper than the 4K display one, so more power to those who agree with me on purchasing the model that resonates a lower resolution. Both models come with a 13.3-inch display, so you can wonder now why we’re recommending you to purchase that variant. Dell also states that it turned to machined aluminum and carbon fiber to make the laptops durable, and it used Gorilla Glass to protect the screen. Coming to the internals, the new models come with Intel’s new-generation Kaby Lake CPUs, i5 and i7, which are paired with 8GB of RAM memory in the default configuration, but it can be upgraded to sport 16GB and 1TB of storage. The graphics card is Intel’s HD Graphics 650, which will give you a nominal performance boost. Advertisement The price of the base model will start from $799 in the United States for the entry-level model and $1,499 for the Rose Gold configuration. While you will not be able to purchase it right now, sales will begin on October 4. What did you think of the upgraded lineup? Tell us your thoughts right away.

The platform will monitor and analyze key symptoms that impact daily living to better understand disease progression and improve treatment evaluation, Teva, the world’s largest generic drug maker, said. Huntington is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by uncoordinated and uncontrollable movements, cognitive deterioration and behavioral and/or psychological problems. As part of a joint study, patients will be asked to use a smartphone and wear a smartwatch equipped with sensing technology that continuously measures their functioning and movement. These data will be wirelessly streamed to a cloud-based platform developed by Intel to analyze data from wearable devices. Proprietary algorithms will then translate these data, in near real-time, into objective scores of motor symptom severity. The study will start towards the end of the year and will take place in centers in the U.S. and Canada. “Current measurement of symptoms is largely based on observation when the patient sees the doctor,” said Michael Hayden, president of Teva Global R&D. “This technology now provides us with an opportunity to have continuous monitoring.” Want to enjoy 'Zen' reading - with no ads and just the article?

SCOUT Pat Kinnison Imade Intel: How Does A Team Rebound? Robert Allen 09/15/2016 How does Oklahoma State rebound following last week's loss to Central Michigan? Former Cowboy Deion Imade believes this team will bounce back Saturday against Pittsburgh. From time to time we've had former Oklahoma State safety/linebacker and special teams captain Deion Imade to appear on Go Pokes either with projections or analysis. Deion works for an energy company but also is a sideline reporter and color analyst on high school games on television and radio. He is also working with former Oklahoma State quarterback and teammate Clint Chelf on a segment in the pregame show on the Cowboy Network called "From All Sides." We will now give Deion a special assignments seeking his insight as a recent former Cowboys player. We call it Imade Intel. This week he addresses how does a team react following a tough loss and what emotions have to be present to allow them to move on. You've heard the old coach's line, down't let a loss beat you twice. The Cowboys have a very good Pitt team coming in and they can't let Central Michigan help out Pitt. Pitt doesn't need any help. Imade Intel Let me start by saying this for all those who say, "hey, the Cowboys should've been destroying those guys and they should've never let it come down to the final seconds of the game." If you look across that field, that's still a Division I football team with an NFL-caliber quarterback. I’m not here to make excuses, but I am here to try to express to you how hard this game is, especially on this level, so any win is a good win. I say win because that's what Oklahoma State did last weekend. They won that game but the referees took the victory away from them. You're only guaranteed 12 opportunities in Division I football but you work year-round for those 12, so it just pains me to see those Cowboys get punished for the mistake of others. With that being said, it is time to move on. We all have faced adversity before – every person, every family, every team. Some are just more devastating than others. Although we don’t all face adversity that you can see over and over again on SportsCenter top plays. After you they turn off the TV and get over that, the real question is how do you react after you are struck by that adversity? Do you wither away, do you crumble or do you answer back? Does it make you stronger and bring you closer together as a team? Well that's the question these Cowboys are going to have to answer, and they are going to have to do it Saturday. All of us Oklahoma State fans and alumni are not used to seeing our Cowboys lose this early in the season. I remember my senior year in 2013 when we went to Morgantown, West Virginia and lost to a team that we were not supposed to lose to. We have all been told this, if you've been around this game long enough, “you can't leave anything to chance and you can't leave the game in the hands of the referees.” Well, that was definitely true that day in West Virginia, as it was last Saturday as well. That adversity was hard for our team to overcome. We did, though, with great leadership and a coaching staff and team that bought in, we did. That year we used that loss to motivate our team, not wanting to experience that sour taste of defeat again anytime soon. The practices were more intense, we figured out what we were doing wrong and put the right players in place to solve those problems. Mike Tyson once said “everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face." Well the Cowboys just got sucker punched in the gut, but I have faith that they will come out of their corner swinging.   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout Three-and-out: NFL’s best matchups of Week 11 Cowboy Spotlight: Zach Sinor Location, Location, Location.

Few states have more at stake than Oregon. By Patrick Reiten In this unorthodox political year, some of the most volatile issues point toward a single problem: Too many Americans who once earned enough to provide a stable living for their families by working in factories have lost those jobs and can't find comparable work in other occupations. This angst and the political movements it has helped launch have led both major-party presidential nominees to oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Each candidate has identified other scapegoats as well, from immigrants to Wall Street. Little, if any, of this conversation has been productive. In 2012, Oregon ranked second among states for the percentage of gross domestic product attributed to manufacturing, 27.7 percent. Only Indiana at 28.2 percent was higher. Manufacturers across Oregon are providing family-wage jobs: the average manufacturing wage in 2014 was $64,000, compared with $46,500 for all jobs, according to the Oregon Employment Department. Associated Oregon Industries is hosting the Oregon Manufacturers' Roundtable on Tuesday in Salem, at which businesses will discuss the everyday obstacles they must overcome to produce and sell goods – and provide family-wage jobs – in Oregon. Those who come will hear some good news: The solutions to these challenges are much simpler than building a wall or renegotiating trade treaties. Successful manufacturers have business models that work in a global, technologically advanced economy. They make high-quality products that meet the needs of their customers. These products require a skilled workforce, and companies have found those workers in Oregon. Intel ships semiconductors produced in Oregon around the world. Other global giants, including Boeing and Daimler, also make products in Oregon. Home-grown companies such as Nike and Tillamook have internationally recognized brands. Greenbrier Companies' Oregon-made products command respect in the rail and barge industries. And forest products manufacturers have long been a cornerstone for the state economy. These and other large manufacturers are an essential part of the state's economic foundation, but it requires businesses of all sizes to build a sustainable economy that can provide jobs and hope to future generations – the type of hope that younger voters have shown that they are longing for in this election season. To create that hope, Oregon must nurture its smaller, less-known manufacturers. Companies such as Oregon Aero of Scappoose that makes flight-related products ranging from headsets and helmets to seating systems. Or Miles Fiberglass Components in Oregon City that produces fiberglass and composite components for products as diverse as recreational vehicles and wind turbines. They succeed in competitive product categories by doing their job well and meeting customers' needs. And when they succeed, they spend more money with suppliers, helping other Oregon companies add jobs. Share your opinion Submit your essay of 700 words or less to commentary@oregonlive.com. Please include your email and phone number for verification. Each Oregon manufacturer faces a unique set of challenges. Many of their challenges are so industry-specific that government can't do much to help. That's why one-size-fits-all legislation rarely works, and why rules applying the same scheduling restrictions to all businesses could be crippling.   But manufacturers do need some basic things from government. They need a modern transportation system to get their products to markets near and far. They need workers, some with four-year college degrees and some with specialized vocational technical training. And they need to be able to expand when customers are demanding their products without waiting months or years to obtain necessary permits. Providing the type of business climate that allows manufacturers to succeed is an achievable goal – and it doesn't require building a wall or renegotiating international treaties. It just requires healthy collaboration among businesses and between business and government.   -- Patrick Reiten is chairman of the board of Associated Oregon Industries and president and chief executive officer of PacifiCorp Transmission.

Password Laptops & Notebooks Theyre completely portable, and they use less power and make less noise than desktop models. But what if you have questions ?   Thread Tools Display Modes Big 4K screen workstation  thin and light MSI WS72 revealed   (#1) windwithme Master Guru     Videocard: P55/DDR3-1600/8GB Processor: Intel Core i5-750 Mainboard: Memory: Soundcard: PSU: HX520W Big 4K screen workstation  thin and light MSI WS72 revealed - 09-17-2016, 07:24 | posts: 552 In the past, it was more common for workstations to position themselves among computers on the PC market. Their built-in graphics card could significantly enhance the level of work efficiency for 3D CAD or video editors. Combining these two working environments demands, nearly three years later companies started to produce their workstations as a brand product line. After all, all workstations position themselves as high-end products with the specifications required by the professional users who prepare a certain budget for this kind of product. Id like to share an overview of MSI WS72 6QJ. As you can see on the box, the logo is different from the Gaming Dragon logo as its light green and workstation highlights the product positioning. The large backpack also has the same logo. WS workstation series and the companys GS series share a high degree of similarity in appearance. They both belong to the slim design product series. Even though the screen size ranges from 15.6 to 17.3, small weight and thickness still deliver extraordinary performance. The dimensions are 418.5mm x 287mm x 19.9mm, the weight is found to be about 2,630 gram. Its lighter than GS72 (2.6 kg) and its thickness is below the one Intel 15-inch Ultrabooks specifications state (21 mm). WS72 is a great combination of both an Ultrabooks slim design and high-performance hardware. The backside of the backpack is made of very solid materials. The separator inside is also quite thick. In terms of overall creativity, some individuals may think that theres still space for improvement and that GS70 looks better. Improved texture and fashionable design would let people like it more. WS72 6QJ Included accessories: CD drivers, Quick Start Guide, Product Features Guide, Two years warranty, DELTA 150W power adapter, power cable, Mini DisplayPort adapter, MSI dedicated mouse. A-side is covered with black brushed metal with a car hood design. Probably due to the materials change, WS72s metal touch is obviously better than GS70s. The main design of GS72 from Gaming Series is the same as WS72; the new generation of materials and design are now being introduced. When the laptop is on and in use, the logo illuminates light green enhancing appearance of the texture. B-side is a 17.3-inch screen which is UHD 4K with a resolution of 3840x2160. It features a wide view IPS panel and supports 100% Adobe RGB color gamut which enhances the color accuracy. WebCam with fixed focus lens is FHD 1920X1080p and is capable of recording video at 30fps. The frame is made of matte plastic material. The thickness is within the common scope and seems to be thinner than WS60. As for the internal mechanism these high-end hardware designs are necessary, C and D parts need to have a certain volume to in order to achieve high performance. As a concept of big length and width in the machine, if the length X width dimensions let the frame area be narrowed then it will definitely improve the thickness. WS72 can be this thin and there are no other competitive models which have the same length x width dimensions but are larger in weight. Its therefore already considered to be a good level product. Most of the C-side is also covered with black brushed metal and is similar to A-side. The actual surface area and the body thickness are similar to Dell Alienware 17. The notebook is equipped with thin full-color Steelseries keyboard which is common for MSI high-end notebooks. The default color is blue. Using the software, users can choose the backlight color they want as well as display color mode. Individuals used to think that Steelseries had soft keys, however this time WS72 has improved the force feedback. In terms of high-end notebook market, WS72 has improved the feeling of typing on a keyboard quite a lot. The power button is in the top center and is illuminated with white during notebooks use. Its illuminated with orange or blue when dedicated or integrated graphics card is in use, respectively. The speakers are still by Dynaudio consisting of 2 channel- and 4 usual speakers. Four single speakers are located in the chassis area which is a more special location for the sound to come out. The following paragraph includes detailed comments regarding the sound. The grid above the keyboard is used for cooling, not for the audio. On the bottom left of the C-side there are 7 status indicators. The left are right buttons feel like scissors design. It will take some time to get used to the strength control. Line out \ Line in \ Headphone-out On the left side, from left to right: GPU cooling grid\ RJ45 Gigabit Ethernet \ HDMI \ Mini-DisplayPort X2 \ USB 3.1 X2 \ Line out \ Line in \ Headphone-out     windwithme View Public Profile Find all posts by windwithme     (#2) windwithme Master Guru     Videocard: P55/DDR3-1600/8GB Processor: Intel Core i5-750 Mainboard: Memory: Soundcard: PSU: HX520W 09-17-2016, 07:30 | posts: 552 On the right side, from left to right: USB3.0 X2 \ SD(XC/HC) \ DC power jack \ Kensington lock slot \ CPU cooling grid D-side also consists of metal-based materials. The number of pads supporting WS72s button is quite big. The three pads above boost and strengthen the cooling function. The dark purple pad nearby isolates the heat and avoids users contact with the hardware design. The hardware warranty is up to 3 years. The built-in battery cannot be dismantled. It holds 5000mAh and is capable of 55.5Wh. The screen can be opened up to about 140 degrees. In terms of its own applications, MSI has increased their number comparing to the past. Apart from some previously existed and revised software, there are now also new applications with other features. In the lower right corner you can find a quick settings app  SYSTEM CONTROL MANAGER. Similarly to a quick selection on a mobile device, you can do relatively rapid adjustments for some commonly used features. KLM is software designed for setting keyboard LED backlighting. There are 6 modes: Normal, Gaming, Breathing, Wave, Dual, Color, Audio. Nowadays many Gaming keyboards have such features which make the keyboards recognizable and change their exterior design. Below is the description of the listening experience. This part is quite subjective, other notebooks built-in speakers are taken as a benchmark. Adjusting the volume to the maximum is considered fairly loud, so there is no need to worry that the speakers will be too quiet. High frequency: The sound isnt too sharp. Good in deep details, the performance is above average. Middle frequency: Excellent overall clarity in details. The quality of human voice sound is one of the best among high-end models. Low frequency: the low frequency performance is good; bass doesnt sound too hoarse, even though medium frequency in a too large volume can easily overwhelm the low frequency. The sound quality of WS72 does not reprise of the original feed line, unlike other high-end gaming notebooks with a sense of surround sound or field-based sound Listening to music or songs brings a very good feeling, watching movies or playing games also carries very good performance. In the past, the sound performance of WS72 wasnt possible to see on a graph. Now the sound performance is even better than on most gaming models. True Color is also screen color calibration software. In the past, many laptops with non-IPS panels had unsatisfactory performance in color reproduction. But even in case of IPS-panels, there was still a room for improvement in color accuracy. MSI is among high-end laptops used by individuals and is brand with certain requirements for the screen colors. In the field of workstation or graphic design, color accuracy is the main condition. One of the modes is sRGB which provides the color correction with nearly 100% sRGB color gamut standard. In total, there are 6 modes: Gamer***65295;Anti-Blue***65295;sRGB***65295;100%AdobeRGB***65295;Off ice***65295;Movie. 100%AdobeRGB provides a function of a more detailed calibration which is even for helpful for professional graphics or image processing. Gamer and 100%AdobeRGB modes differ in details. MSI True Color has already adjusted the settings with adaptive colors. Of course, users can adjust the colors the way they want. Shortcut Manager is also exclusive keyboard software. It mainly allows to assign macro keys and to upload your own settings files. It supports setting shortcuts, text clips, 3 modes of quick start and also 4 features of key disabling function. The comparison of the right side of MSI WS72s screen during Designer mode and the left side of HP Zbook Studio G3s screen. When adjusting brightness, both screens look similar, but due to different tones brightness still looks a bit different. You can also see 4K vs 1080p difference in font details, especially if the difference is image size is big. The following are tests of the performance aspects. In this workstation, except for the common 6th Gen. Intel Core i7, there is also a Server-level version of CPU which uses Intel Xeon E3-1505M v5. The specs include: Intels latest Skylake architecture, with the base clock is 2.8 GHz, is quad-core and support HT technology, the latest 14 nm processor, TurboBoost automatic overclocking up to 3.7, CM236 chipset, SmartCache of up to 8MB and built-in GPU Intel HD Graphics P530. Hardware benchmark tests CINEBENCH R15 CPU => 664 cb CPU(Single Core) => 144 cb     windwithme View Public Profile Find all posts by windwithme   (#3) windwithme Master Guru     Videocard: P55/DDR3-1600/8GB Processor: Intel Core i5-750 Mainboard: Memory: Soundcard: PSU: HX520W 09-17-2016, 07:45 | posts: 552 FRYRENDER Running Time => 5m 06s x264 FHD Benchmark => 22.9 PCMARK8  3268 Intel Xeon E3-1505M v5 vs. Core i7 performance comparison The clock performance and SmartCache are higher than i7-6700HQ. Xeon CPU performance generally has a more stable high performance in consumers eyes. In addition, it can be equipped with ECC DRAM, which is a required option for workstations specifications. DRAM benchmark test DDR4 2132.2 CL15 15-15-36 2T AIDA64 Memory Read - 30154 MB/s Sandra Memory Bandwidth - 24576 MB/s Embedding DDR4 improves clock a lot. Moreover, the bandwidth also improves a lot, thanks to 6th Generation Skylake architecture. Xeon CPU can run with ECC DRAM, even though its bandwidth isnt much different from the usual DDR4-2133 has. However, stability performance is still the main characteristics of ECC, especially for drawing or work environment. I believe that stability is the first required item, because a system cannot be the reason for business losses due to its crash. As for GPU, WS72 is carrying nVidia Quadro M2000M professional-level graphics card. Its built-in with 4GB GDDR5. Even though not the highest-end graphics card, its thin shape already looks pretty good for WS72. If you a higher-end graphics card in the notebook, MSI has a thick-body WT72 which can be competent with GT72 version. Below are some testing software made specifically for 3D graphic design to refer to. SPECviewperf12 I saw in some discussions online that SPECviewpefr12 can support DX11. If comparing to 970M, the difference is relatively small. nVidia Quadro graphics card advertised that it has a double-precision floating point architecture. GeForce single precision has a better precision mechanism computing power. Therefore, nVidia Quadro is more suitable for professional more sophisticated computational design. TessMark => 24289 points Comparison with other two, workstation and gaming, notebooks HP HP Zbook Studio G3 with M1000M scores about 17655 points Dell Alienware 15 with GTX 970Mscores about 8834 points The information is misleading as its for the integrated GPU. Please, refer to GPU-Z M2000M for the actual information. FluidMark => 1598 points The software can correctly display the information about a dedicated M2000M graphics card. Since nVidia and AMD classify themselves into DirectX and OpenGL, they have their own area of expertise in 3D. Though above there arent many pages with benchmark tests, there could be 10-50 pages occupied with different examinations. Using M1000M and GTX 970M simultaneously for performance comparison it would be easier to analyze advantages. Remember how before we would compare a graphics card with a gaming card of the same-level chipset, the gaming card would only display single-digit fps in the testing software. In the regard, the gap was quite large. nVIDIA Quadro M2000M is also able to run such a 3D graphics software such as AutoCad. Certainly, some drawings are in 2D field. However, to use 3D graphics software, having 3D graphics card is a must. There might be quite many people interested in M2000Ms performance in general games. In fact, Im no exception. 3DMark11 => P5600 3DMARK => 3942 M2000Ms performance is similar to one gaming card of GTX 960M shows. To be able to run heave 3D-level games, its just necessary not to set the highest resolution. Then the main work should be carried out by workstation or selected gaming notebooks. So, the performance in gaming should also be on a good level.     windwithme View Public Profile Find all posts by windwithme   (#4) windwithme Master Guru     Videocard: P55/DDR3-1600/8GB Processor: Intel Core i5-750 Mainboard: Memory: Soundcard: PSU: HX520W 09-17-2016, 08:07 | posts: 552 WS72s drive C includes SAMSUNG MZVPV128HDGM 128GBX2 M.2 SSD The drive D is HGST HTS721010A9E630 which specs are 7200 RPM and 1 TB capacity for storing files Below is a benchmark test of 128GBX2 M.2 SSD Raid0 on the Drive C AS SSD Benchmark - 2448 Seq Read - 2752.91 MB/s Write - 1301.17 MB/s 4K - 64Thrd Read - 977.29 MB/s Write - 307.52MB/s CrystalDiskMark Seq Read - 3183MB/s Write - 1357MB/s ATTO DISK Benchmark, when exceeding 32k on the above test, can show the read speed equal to 3330Mb/s and the write speed equal to 1378MB/s WS72 includes MSI SUPER RAID4 technology which is when two M.2 SSD cards are run in Raid0 mode. With high-performance M.2 SSD you can boost the read/write performance speed while with SATA3 its hard to achieve such a bandwidth. Its said that the read speed can be as high as 3300MB/s. Its also certainly achievable according to ATTO. CrystalDiskMark also shows close number: 3200. MSI equipped with a conventional large-capacity HDD which is indeed good as it expands the storage space. If SSD price continues to decrease in the future, with the internal space of 512GB or higher it wont be really necessary to embed HDD. The notebook will then be even lighter. With room temperature about 32 degrees, proceeding to CPU cooling capacity test. The CPU being at a preset value of 2.8~3.7GHz, GPU running with Quadro M2000M, with power supply on the turbo mode. With Cooler Boost 3 used as a cooling technology, the systems idle temperature is about 39~42. AIDA64 System Stability Test - 81~89 WS72s outer shells temperature feels a bit higher than the notebooks made from other materials. This is because thermal conduction on metal body is more direct and more evident. With embedded 4C8T Architectures Xeon which is the same Core i7 CPUs, CPU temperature is only 42 degrees in standby mode thanks to outstanding cooling capacity. However, it doesnt exceed 90 degrees when CPU is running at its full speed, which is comparable with many thick-body notebooks thermal modules. In fact, WS72s cooling capacity is already at a high level. It involves up to 5 heat pipes to enhance heat dissipation. Also, the noise produced by the radiator can be considered to be partially muted. Moreover, at the low frequencies, the sound doesnt feel uncomfortable either. Battery life endurance, Windows 10 at a balanced power. After playing DVD video on WS72 for 90 minutes, the battery will be at about 50%. After 120 minutes, there will be about 33% power left. Maximum usage can be for around 3 hours. With such a high-end hardware, 4K resolution screen consumes more power then FHD. WS72s life endurance is therefore about average which is considered as a very good battery performance. Summary of WS72 6QJs advantages and disadvantages Pros of features and advantages: 1.Regarding the external ID design and the shell texture, the notebooks thickness and weight are truly outstanding. 2.Equipped Intel Xeon CPU and ECC DDR4 enhance stability which is workstations requirement. 3.4K high resolution IPS matte panel features 100% NTSC color gamut and 100% Adobe RGB color correction. 4.True color correction technology and a variety of adaptive modes provide more accurate colors. 5.After the evolution of SteelSeries keyboards, the keys force feedback feeling is of a high standard among notebooks. 6.Single speaker sound level brings clear audio experience to users. 7.High-speed 256GB M.2 SSD and 1TB HDD provide both performance and capacity. 8.3-year factory warranty is higher than usual gaming notebooks 2-year warranty. Cons for future improvements 1.Due to the thin metal body design, users in summer will feel that the laptops temperature is slightly higher. 2.Backpack looks like the one from Gaming series. 3.Although the front camera captures at a high level, theres still a room for quality improvement.

Its worth a credit since individuals used to use DELL or HP workstation. It terms of audio and keyboard, its still graded as a usual notebook, theres nothing particular to highlight. Of course, graphics card or Xeon CPU with ECC RAM are workstations all requirements. MSI also has an advantage in its panel calibration. The default colors are bright yet accurate. It provides a great help and comfort for working or designing which sounds very impressive to people at first glance. WS72 also has some lower-price versions with Core i7, common DDR4 and 1080P panel. If theres no demand for high-level hardware, then it also represents a good budget-based choice, even though 3D graphics machines are all in the high-end market. With every update MSI has been showing some progress or introducing new technology and of course there are some weaknesses or disadvantages. However, theres an obvious significant progress comparing to GS70 from the previous generation. This is a good and a positive cycle. In terms of visuals and audio, WS72 looks very competitive to windwithme. After all, a combination of gaming background and workstation make it an excellent notebook.

While the argument both for and against are equally valid, many of the top Wall Street strategists we cover feel that they want a few more months of data, and most importantly, regardless of who wins they want to get the presidential election behind us. The volatility in the markets has shaken some of the top dividend leaders and may be giving long-term investors a great buying opportunity. Many of the Wall Street firms we cover here at 24/7 Wall St. are becoming increasingly conservative and suggesting clients go to large cap names that pay solid dividends. We screened the Merrill Lynch research universe and found four that are rated Buy and pay a higher dividend than the 30-year U.S. Treasury, which currently yields a 2.4%. Helmerich & Payne This company primarily operates as a contract drilling company in South America, the Middle East and Africa. Helmerich & Payne Inc. (NYSE: HP) provides drilling rigs, equipment, personnel and camps on a contract basis to explore for and develop oil and gas from onshore areas and fixed platforms, tension-leg platforms and spars in offshore areas. Its contract drilling business operates through three reportable segments: U.S. Land, Offshore and International Land. The company posted second-quarter earnings that many felt came in much better than expected. At last report, the company’s U.S. Land rig segment, which is its largest business, had a utilization rate of 31%, compared to 68% this time last year. The International Land operations also saw utilization rates decline to 38%. What is slightly surprising, though, is that the average margin for a rig in use increased between this quarter and the same time last year. Many top Wall Street analysts feel that the company is one of the best positioned for the U.S. land recovery, and they also cite the strong balance sheet and the sector leading dividend. Helmerich & Payne investors receive a big 4.9% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price target for the stock is a whopping $72, and the consensus price objective is $59.68. Shares closed Tuesday at $57.18. Intel This leader in semiconductors is working hard to scale away from dependence on personal computers. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) designs, manufactures and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide. The company’s platforms are used in various computing applications comprising notebooks, two-in-one systems, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, wireless and wired connectivity products, wearables, retail devices and manufacturing devices, as well as for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings, home use and other market segments. The company also provides communication and connectivity offerings, such as baseband processors, radio frequency transceivers and power management integrated circuits, and tablet, phone and Internet of Things solutions, which include multimode 4G LTE modems, Bluetooth technology and GPS receivers, software solutions and interoperability tests, as well as home gateway and set-top box components. Intel reported an inline second quarter, but data center sales came in way below expectations. But a new partnership with Microsoft for a virtual reality, as well as a consistent shift away for reliance on chips for personal computers, keeps the stock a compelling buy. Intel investors receive a 2.92% dividend. Merrill Lynch has a $42 price target, while the consensus target is $37.90. The shares closed most recently at $35.61.

Lily Hay Newman and Andy Greenberg Security Date of Publication: 09.17.16. 09.17.16 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am Security News This Week: Congress Celebrates the Snowden Movie by Slamming Snowden Open Road Films Clinton and Trump aren’t the only ones campaigning this fall. The ACLU, Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International came together this week in a renewed initiative to get whistleblower Edward Snowden pardoned by the Obama administration before he leaves office in January. Conveniently, Snowden, the biopic directed Oliver Stone, opens this weekend and portrays Snowden in an extremely positive light. As you’ll see in our news roundup below, however, Congress is far from convinced. The New York Attorney General’s office announced that it’s cracking down on websites for kids that illegally track browsing. Meanwhile, the Justice Department is working to expand the scale and scope of law enforcement’s malware distribution and hacking. And it turns out that the FBI, despite its claims to the contrary, likely could have hacked one of the San Bernardino shooters’ iPhones without the cooperation it demanded from Apple. With an attack on the World Anti-Doping Agency, Russian hackers seemed to be getting even more more brazen than in their hack of the Democratic National Committee. In a long-awaited decision, a U.K. judge ruled that activist Lauri Love should be extradited to the U.S. to face hacking charges. And malicious third-party iOS app stores are distributing adware-laced Pokémon Go apps to millions of iPhones. (See more Pokémon Go-related malware below.) Oh, and it turns out that pixelating or blurring images to obscure the people and objects in them can be defeated by modern machine learning techniques. Not very comforting for all those unwilling guest stars on COPS. And there’s more: Each Saturday we round up the news stories that we didn’t break or cover in depth but still deserve your attention. As always, click on the headlines to read the full story in each link posted. And stay safe out there. House Intel Committee Slams Snowden in Leak Investigation Report Three years after Edward Snowden walked out of the NSA with a trove of its secrets and flew to Hong Kong, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has released the first glimpse of its investigation into the fallout. And how convenient that it arrived 24 hours before the opening weekend of Snowden, the Hollywood film directed by Oliver Stone that portrays the young whistleblower as a full-blown hero. “Edward Snowden is no hero – he’s a traitor who willfully betrayed his colleagues and his country,” committee chair Devin Nunes wrote in a statement accompanying the three-page report. It accuses Snowden of faking performance reviews, lying about breaking his legs in Army training, and copying 1.5 million documents, thus endangering national security. In his Twitter feed and via his lawyer, Snowden denied most of those points. He wrote that he hadn’t actually faked a performance review but instead reported a security vulnerability in the review system, and that he’d spent weeks convalescing for his leg injuries in an Army medical center before walking out on crutches. As for the 1.5 million documents, his ACLU lawyer, Ben Wizner, called the tally “nonsensical,” saying that the NSA had overestimated the number because it couldn’t determine how many files Snowden had copied. Justice Department OKs FBI’s Impersonation of AP Journalist In 2007, the FBI impersonated an Associated Press editor to communicate with a suspected source of a high school bomb threat, tricking him into opening an email attachment that planted malware on his computer and revealed the 15-year-old’s location. When the incident was disclosed by the Seattle Times seven years later, the AP and several newspapers protested the tactic, which could inhibit the press’ ability to do its work without suspicion. Now the Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General has released the results of its investigation into the incident and essentially declared the move kosher. “FBI policies did not prohibit the practice of agents impersonating journalists, nor was there any requirement that agents seek special approval to engage in such practice,” the report states. The AP responded that it’s “deeply disappointed” in the decision, which “compromises the ability of a free press to gather the news safely and effectively and raises serious constitutional concerns.” The FBI, for its part, has since changed its policy to prohibit impersonation of the news media. Swedish Court Preserves Arrest Warrant in Julian Assange Sexual Assault Case A Swedish appeals court upheld Julian Assange’s six-year-old arrest warrant, after he challenged it again. The WikiLeaks founder has spent more than three years living in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London because he claims that going to Sweden would put him at risk for being extradited to the U.S. on espionage charges related to classified information WikiLeaks has published. The arrest warrant is aimed at interrogating Assange; he hasn’t been formally indicted. The statute of limitations for the case is 10 years and will expire in 2020 if Swedish prosecutors don’t indict him by then, but they say that they are working to advance the case and Assange is scheduled to be interrogated by Ecuadorian officials on behalf of Swedish law enforcement in October. Hacker Breaches Science News Embargo Site EurekAlert! Last week a hacker compromised all the login credentials of the science news service EurekAlert!, which journalists and public information officers user to access new research papers in advance of their publication. A German journalist notified EurekAlert! of the breach after the hacker attempted to sell him login credentials for the site. The attacker also released two news releases ahead of their embargo dates. EurekAlert, which is a division of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, took its site off line, and it’s been down since Tuesday evening. The service says that it has “rebuilt the EurekAlert! system environment” and hopes to reinstate the site over the weekend. When it’s live again, the site says that all passwords will be reset. Criminals Snuck a Trojan Into the Google Play Store By Disguising it as a Pokémon Go Guide Kaspersky Lab recently notified Google that an app called “Guide For Pokémon Go” was actually a malicious Trojan lurking in its Play store. Users downloaded the app more than 500,000 times before the researchers caught it, and it infected at least 6,000 phones with malware. Once downloaded, the system appeared to offer real advice about Pokémon Go, but it also scanned its host device checking to see whether it was a private individual’s phone or a test unit used to detect malicious attacks. Only if the environment seemed safe did the Trojan begin downloading other malicious files. Kaspersky Lab found that, for now, the criminals running the attack use the Trojan to place adware on victims’ phones, but the researchers caution that the same system could easily be used to inject ransomware or other more damaging and intrusive malware. Google Offers $200,000 Bug Bounty for Best Android Attack Apple apparently raised the bar for bug bounties when in August it announced a $200,000 reward for any white-hat hacker who tells the company about a previously unknown full takeover technique for iOS devices. Now Google is matching that sum—for at least one lucky hacker. In a new contest it’s calling the Project Zero Prize, the company will pay out $200,000 to the hacker or team of hackers that submits the best sequence of vulnerabilities that can fully compromise an Android phone. (Modern hacking techniques typically require not a single bug, but many linked together to defeat all the protections of a device’s operating system.) The runner-up will receive $100,000, and other worthy entries will each receive $50,000. For now, only Nexus 6P and Nexus 5x phones are valid targets—after all, why bother digging up brilliant hackable vulnerabilities in the majority of other Android phones when their users don’t get patches for them?

The red team has made bold claims about its new card, saying that it’s the best 1440p and VR-ready card for around £200. The RX 480’s new architecture and lower price see it charge headlong into one of computing’s busiest battlefields - and, in particular, up against Nvidia’s older GTX 970. New hardware has caused that card to drop in price, which means it’s now a key challenger for AMD’s card. Is it worth shelling out for the new Radeon, or can Nvidia’s classic GTX 970 hold its own? If you want to read our individual reviews, you can click here for the RX 480 and the GTX 970. Related: Best graphics cards in 2016 Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 v AMD Radeon RX 480 – Specs and technology AMD has made the unusual decision to debut its Polaris architecture with this mid-range card. There’s a lot to like about the fourth iteration of the Graphics Core Next system, not least the move from a 28nm to a 14nm manufacturing process. That’s a bigger leap than Nvidia has taken with its new 16nm Pascal cards, and it means that AMD can cram even more transistors into the same area without increasing heat and power consumption. The RX 480 remains a mid-range card, so expectations should be managed. It has a reasonable 2,304 stream processors divided into 36 Compute Units for more granular task delegation, and its core sits at stock and boost speeds of 1,120MHz and 1,266MHz. Video: AMD Radeon RX 480 review AMD’s card has some software features that have also been introduced on Nvidia’s new hardware, like better asynchronous computing. That’ll help when managing CPU and GPU workloads in games with DirectX 12, but it’s not a feature that’ll be coming to the GTX 970. AMD is building the RX 480 in two versions – one with 4GB of GDDR5 memory, and one with 8GB. The 8GB card will have faster memory, too, with throughput of 8Gbps compared to 7Gbps from the lesser card. Prices fluctuate pretty rapidly, which is why the GTX 970 is such a close competitor to the RX 480. The Radeon’s specification compares well to Nvidia’s older card. The GTX 970 uses the older 28nm manufacturing process, which means it has half a billion fewer transistors than its rival, and it only has 1,664 stream processors. Its stock and boost clocks sit at 1,050MHz and 1,250MHz, and it has just one memory configuration: 4GB of GDDR5. Related: Best gaming PC specs to build yourself The GTX 970’s lesser specification means it provides a throughput rating of 3.4TFLOPS – far less than the 5.8TFLOPS of the AMD card. There’s little between their power consumption ratings, despite that: the RX 480’s 150W power demand is only five Watts higher than the GTX 970. It doesn’t sound like much of a contest on paper, but the benchmarks reveal a far closer fight than I expected. Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 v AMD Radeon RX 480 – Testing Methodology I benchmarked the GTX 970 and RX 480 on TrustedReviews’ test rig, which has been designed to match the specifications of a standard enthusiast gaming PC. It features the following components: Motherboard: Asus Z170-Deluxe Processor: Intel Core i5-6600K (not overclocked) RAM: Corsair Vengeance 2666MHz, 16GB DDR4 Cooler: Corsair H60 liquid cooler PSU: Corsair CX750M SSD: Samsung 850 EVO OS: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 v AMD Radeon RX 480 – Performance I’ve tested these powerful cards with five games. Each title is run at its highest settings, and I’ve tested each game at 1,920 x 1,080, 2,560 x 1,440 and 3,840 x 2,160 – 4K. I’ve also used a selection of synthetic benchmarks, with 3D Mark’s demanding Fire Strike test alongside benchmarks to measure power consumption and peak temperature. DIRT Rally Ultra at 1,920 x 1,080 average  GTX 970: 97.3  RX 480: 88.9 Ultra at 2,560 x 1,440, average  GTX 970: 65.4  RX 480: 61.6 Ultra at 3,840 x 2,160, average  GTX 970: 34.4  RX 480: 34.7 This is the easiest game in this testing setup, with plenty of fast-paced textures but less intensive workloads in other departments. It’s no surprise that both cards blitzed this rally racer at 1080p: the RX 480 averaged 88.9fps, while the Nvidia card was about nine frames faster. That means the GTX 970 had an 8.63% lead, but the gap closed to 5.81% at 1440p – perhaps because the RX 480 is flexing its extra transistors and memory. Both cards beat the magical 60fps figure, with the Nvidia silicon almost four frames ahead. Both cards also managed to beat 30fps at 4K, which isn’t too surprising considering that this is a less intensive game. I was surprised when the AMD hardware took a slim lead: its 34.7fps average is 0.3fps ahead of the Nvidia card. That’s good, but don’t expect either of these GPUs to handle 4K gaming. Those 34fps averages will be undermined by sluggish minimum framerates, especially when the on-screen action becomes more frantic. Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor Ultra at 1,920 x 1,080 average  GTX 970: 85.4  RX 480: 83.6 Ultra at 2,560 x 1,440, average  GTX 970: 55.9 RX 480: 57.2 Ultra at 3,840 x 2,160, average  GTX 970: 37.7  RX 480: 39.3 This game is full of particle and fire effects, which can make it a little tricky for some GPUs, especially considering I run this test at Ultra settings. Nvidia’s card continued its 1080p lead with an average framerate of 85.4fps, but its advantage was a slim 2fps – and it was overturned when I turned the resolution up to 2,560 x 1,440. With the larger number of pixels deployed the RX 480 averaged 57.2fps, which was more than a frame faster than the Nvidia card. Both of these GPUs managed to run the benchmark at 4K, too. The RX 480 maintained its slim advantage with an average of 39.3fps. Hitman Max Settings at 1,920 x 1,080, average  GTX 970: 59  RX 480: 69.7 Max Settings at 2,560 x 1,440, average  GTX 970: 45.4  RX 480: 54.3 Max Settings at 3,840 x 2,160, average  GTX 970: 25.08  RX 480: 30.6 Hitman is a game designed with AMD in mind, so the results here aren't surprising. It’s a competitive set of results for a title that’s among the toughest benchmarks around thanks to its reliance on high-end lighting and particle effects. Its Full HD average of 69.7fps was ten frames better than the GTX 970 and on the right side of the crucial 60fps barrier, and it was nine frames quicker than its rival at 1440p. The Radeon’s average of 54.3fps will ensure smooth gameplay at this higher resolution. The RX 480 maintained a good lead at 4K, too. Its average of 30.6fps is five frames better than the GTX 970 and it does break the important 30fps barrier, but don’t assume that it’ll play Hitman smoothly at 4K without compromising on several of the graphics options. Rise of the Tomb Raider Max Settings at 1,920 x 1,080 average  GTX 970: 60  RX 480: 63.5 Max Settings at 2,560 x 1,440, average  GTX 970: 36.7  RX 480: 44.2 Max Settings at 3,840 x 2,160, average  GTX 970: 19.9 RX 480: 27.3 Tomb Raider strains graphics cards with trickier weather and lighting effects than most other titles on the market. This is also the only game where the RX 480 led the way at every resolution and opened up a wider lead over the GTX 970 as I increased the pixel count. Its 63.46fps average at 1080p was just over three frames quicker than the GTX 970, and the Radeon then scored 44.2fps at 1440p – far better than the 36.7fps over the Nvidia card. That’s a gap of 5.77% improving to a gap of 20.44%. The Radeon averaged 27.33fps at 4K. That means the game isn’t playable at its maximum settings at 3,840 x 2,160, but it was a whopping 37.61% faster than the GTX 970 in the same test. Synthetic Benchmarks, Power and Heat 3D Mark Fire Strike Ultra  GTX 970: 2767  RX 480: 2638 Peak power:  GTX 970: 260W  RX 480: 249W Peak temperature:  GTX 970: 73  RX 480: 70 There’s very little to choose between these two cards in the synthetic 3D Mark Fire Strike test. The GTX 970 leads the way with a score of 2,767 points, but the RX 480 is barely behind thanks to its result of 2,638 points. That supports my conclusions from real-world tests: the GTX 970 might be better in lower resolutions and easier games, but the RX 480 is a more efficient architecture and deploys its power with more aplomb – therefore it takes key victories in tougher tests. AMD’s shrunken architecture consumed less power than its rival, too. The test rig drew 249W from the mains with the Radeon installed, which is 11W less than the Nvidia-powered machine required. And, finally, it’s cooler – albeit only by three degrees. The Radeon’s top temperature of 70°C is an excellent result, and it means there’s no need to fret about overheating. Performance Conclusions There’s a clear trend to be seen across most of my test games: if a game is a tougher benchmark, the RX 480 tends to outperform its older rival. That’s clear evidence of the newer architecture, increased memory throughput and shrunken manufacturing process paying dividends. It’s a victory for the RX 480 in most of the important tests, then, but don’t go thinking that AMD’s cut-price card will handle 4K gaming smoothly. This is a GPU designed for Full HD and 1440p gaming, and in those department it’s stop on – but any higher resolutions will cause it to struggle. The RX 480 consistently beats its rival while consuming less power: its peak draw of 249W is eleven fewer than the same machine with the GTX 970 installed. Buy Now: GTX 970 at Amazon.com from $259 Best Deals for Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 Other Things to Consider My testing looked at an EVGA-overclocked GTX 970 and a reference RX 480. In other words, this is one of the best GTX 970s around versus an early RX 480 that’ll surely improve over time with third-party manufacturers pre-overclocking it and adding beefy cooling systems. This means that the narrow lead the GTX 970 shows in any of the above benchmarks will likely be diminished by more powerful RX 480s. Buy Now: AMD Radeon RX 480 at Amazon.com from $199.99 Best Deals for AMD Radeon RX 480 Verdict The RX 480 delivers excellent Full HD and 1440p performance for a surprisingly low price – and its consistent leads in tougher tests bode well for the future and indicate that AMD’s new hardware is doing its job. The GTX 970 is similarly quick at those resolutions and is a tad cheaper, but it doesn’t have the new architecture, the extra memory or the software improvements – as you'd expect for an older card, of course. If they drop in price even further, they’re still an excellent buy. In this comparison, the RX 480 takes a clear win in the 1440p stakes. But, of course, there are external factors to consider as well. The Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 has arrived on the scene in both 3GB and 6GB guises. We haven't tested the GTX 1060 in 3GB form, but we have full benchmarks of the 6GB version, which show it's a worthy 1440p card.

The TSMC finFET Pascal 1060 is the one to buy for low budget gamer, but you would be much better off saving for a 1070. luke September 19, 2016, 3:57 pm AMD RX480 is selling like hot cakes, as it should - Its a great GPU as is the lesser RX470 Tyrann September 19, 2016, 7:47 pm Weird comparison at this time when you should be comparing RX480 to GTX1060. GTX970's are being phased out so people shouldn't be looking to get those. Also either card won't be able to handle 1440p ultra 60fps. vlx September 19, 2016, 10:53 pm lolwut the gtx 970 beat the rx 480 in dirt rally even though its amd optimized Domaldel September 22, 2016, 9:37 pm Well, there's still the used market. People looking to upgrade to a 1070 or 1080 from a 970 might drive prices down quite a bit and the performance is comparable. The 1060 is more comparable with the 980 in performance and most of them is also more expensive then most of the 480s in most locations, although there are of course exceptions.

Hayley Platt reports ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript They were once dismissed by the makers of luxury Swiss watches as a gadget that won't last. Now some of the biggest names in the sector are getting into the smartwatch market. Last year Tag Heuer teamed up with Google and Intel to produce its own 'connected' device. The first 15,000 sold out fast. This year it's increased the numbers to 50,000. SOUNDBITE (English) TAG HEUER, CEO, JEAN-CLAUDE BIVER, SAYING: "The connected watch is an incredible asset for TAG Heurer. It has regenerated the brand, it has given the brand a new dynamic. It has linked the brand to the future. It has linked the brand to the new generation." Shipments of smartwatches reportedly overtook traditional ones in the last quarter of 2015. Almost all the main export markets for trademark luxury timepieces fell. The U.S by just a little And Japan by almost 2 percent But it was China that suffered the most Only exports to Italy were higher than the previous year (SOUNDBITE) (English): COMMERZBANK, GLOBAL FINANCIAL ECONOMIST, PETER DIXON, SAYING "Obviously sanctions on places like Russia haven't helped. The Chinese slowdown and the backlash against corruption which appears to be going on domestically have also taken the edge off the market and of course the Swiss have been hampered by a very sharp rise in the franc." It was still mainly traditional watches on display at an industry fair in Basel this week. But no-one wants to be late to the smartphone party - and who can blame them. One research group estimates the market will be worth $117 billion by 2020.

Banks and energy producers carried some of the steepest losses, with crude oil sinking to a one-month low. Sentiment on lenders soured as Deutsche Bank AG sparked a selloff in European banks after it rebuffed a Department of Justice offer to settle a probe tied to mortgage-backed securities for US$14 billion (RM57.8 billion). Oracle Corp. declined 3.8 per cent after its quarterly revenue missed estimates. Intel Corp. climbed 2.5 per cent after raising its sales forecast. The S&P 500 Index fell 0.6 per cent to 2,134.37 at 11:03am in New York, after rising yesterday for the first time in three sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 93.65 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 18,118.83. The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.4 per cent. Trading may be subject to unexpected swings in soaring volume Friday because of a quarterly event known as quadruple witching, when futures and options contracts on indexes and individual stocks expire. S&P Dow Jones Indices will also implement its quarterly index rebalancing after the close, including the first reboot of S&P 500 group weights in almost two decades. That will separate real estate investment trusts from the financial industry, creating 11 top-level groups. Trading in S&P 500 shares was 65 per cent higher than the 30-day average for this time of day. “Oil heading toward below the 40s is waking everyone up that it’s probably not going to recover fully,” Brian Frank, portfolio manager at Key Biscayne -based Frank Capital Partners LLC in Florida, said by phone. “You’ve got Deutsche Bank, which is scaring everybody. People are getting fed up with central banks. There’s a lot going on today.” After the European Central Bank and the Bank of England kept monetary policies unchanged, attention is turning to the Fed’s meeting next week. The chances of a September rate increase have fallen to 20 per cent from 30 per cent a week ago, with December the first month with more than even odds of a hike. A report today showed the cost of living in the US rose more than projected in August, indicating that inflation continues to move closer to the Fed’s goal. Separate data showed consumer confidence in September held at the lowest level since April, limited by a smaller share of Americans reporting gains in incomes. “We had a couple of weaker economic numbers yesterday, so that heightens concerns about the macro picture in the US,” said Patrick Spencer, the London-based vice chairman of equities at Robert W. Baird, which manages US$151 billion. “The indexes are trading near all-time highs so some pullback isn’t surprising, but the longer-term trends remain robust so any correction is expected to be limited.” The S&P 500 last struck an all-time high on August 15, following a 26-session run that brought 10 such records. The gauge has since lost 2.5 per cent. Equities whipsawed investors this week after a rout last Friday jolted markets out of their summer languor on concern that central banks are less willing to boost stimulus despite a persistently fragile global economy. A measure of stock volatility has surged toward its biggest monthly gain since August 2015. “The market is trading off of the Fed right now,” said Brent Schutte, who helps oversee US$90 billion as chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company. “When the Fed starts pulling liquidity back, that increases volatility which will be heightened in the next six to nine months.” On the heels of its worst week since February, the main US benchmark index is on track to post an advance for the latest five-day period, rising 0.4 per cent. Apple Inc.’s 12 per cent rally in four days has helped lift technology companies 2.9 per cent. The group, which has a 21 per cent weighting in the S&P 500, is poised for the best week since May. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Fintech association anticipates regional investments European stocks falter, euro hits 12-month dollar low Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Donald Trump takes credit for helping to save a Ford plant that wasn’t closing With Trump win, China looks to seize Asia free trade leadership Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Bank Negara instructs foreign banks to refrain from offshore ringgit trading, sources claim Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Most Watched Now Week Britney Spears, TInashe get down for a ‘Slumber Party’ (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) A Tribe Called Quest spit fire in ‘We the People’ (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Bloomberg Video: Resurrecting Jaguar’s legendary XKSS supercar Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Reuters Video: Thailand sinks boats to tackle illegal fishing Related Articles Wall Street flat at the open; Nasdaq hits record high S&P 500 rises to near record after Yellen as treasuries retreat (VIDEO) Wall St edges up, waiting for signs from Yellen Oil prices fall on US crude stock build, Opec remains in focus US stocks mixed as Samsung announces US$8b Harman deal (VIDEO) Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

By John Gruber Archive The Talk Show Projects Contact Colophon RSS Feed Twitter Sponsorship Why A-Series Benchmark Scores Matter Thursday, 15 September 2016 Thom Holwerda on Twitter, quoting a tweet of mine touting the iPhone 7’s astounding Geekbench scores: Funny how just like in the PPC days, benchmarks only start mattering when they favour [insert platform of choice]. https://twitter.com/gruber/status/776295771943600129 I like reading/following Holwerda, because he’s someone who I feel keeps me on my toes. But he’s off-base here. I’m certainly not saying that CPU or GPU performance is a primary reason why anyone should buy an iPhone instead of an Android phone. In fact, I’ll emphasize that if the tables were turned and it were Android phones that were registering Geekbench scores double those of the iPhone, I would still be using an iPhone. In the same way that I’ve been using Macs, non-stop, since I first purchased a computer in 1991. Most of the years from 1991 until the switch to Intel CPUs in 2007, the Mac was behind PCs in performance. I never argued then that performance didn’t matter — only that for me, personally, the other benefits of using a Mac (the UI design of the system, the quality of the third-party apps, the build quality of the hardware, etc.) outweighed the performance penalty Macs suffered. The same would be true today if Apple’s A-series chips were slower than Qualcomm’s CPUs for Android. But that would likely never happen. If Apple’s in-house chips were significantly slower than the commodity chips used by Android device makers, Apple would just use those commodity chips. The mobile situation would be just like the desktop situation, where Apple uses the same CPUs as everyone else. That’s what makes the A-series chips’ performance so interesting. If the commodity chips were fastest, everyone would use them. But if the A-series chips are the fastest (and have the best energy efficiency), only Apple gets to use them. The iPhone has all the benefits (in short: superior design) that would keep me, and I think most other iPhone users, on the platform even if it didn’t have a performance advantage. But it does have a significant performance advantage, and it is exclusive to Apple. This is an extraordinary situation, historically. And year-over-year, it looks like Apple’s lead is growing, not shrinking. It’s not a fluke, but a sustained advantage.

Fuller A notable milestone marked today’s first meeting in Washington of the FAA’s new Drone Advisory Committee (DAC): a representative of helicopter line pilots was at the table.  Commercial airline pilots have long been a fixture at FAA-industry deliberations on safety and policy decisions, in the form of an Air Line Pilots Assn. representative or two. ALPA was the only group that had two members on last year’s FAA task force on creating a small drone registry; an ALPA rep also sits on the new drone advisory committee. But so too does a representative of the Professional Helicopter Pilots Assn. (PHPA). That union’s president, Steven Rush was among the 35 members named last month by FAA Administrator Michael Huerta to the committee to advise the aviation agency on integrating drones into civil U.S. airspace. The only other rotorcraft representative on the panel is Helicopter Assn. International Presiden Matt Zuccaro. Nearly 400 individuals and organizations that expressed interest in serving on the committee, according to the FAA. It is chaired by Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. The inaugural meeting is at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies. “It took a long time for the line pilots to get a voice at the table on committees such as this,” Rush told R&WI. “It’s been a long time coming but we’re there. And that’s been my goal for the last 15 years: to get our voice heard at this level.” PHPA is a council of the Office and Professional Employees International Union. It represents the interests of member air medical helicopter and fixed-wing pilots and assists in collective bargaining, among other duties. “Just over 1,500 of our members fly the air ambulance helicopters, and the drones operate pretty much in their environment,” said Rush. “So our major thrust will be to see how the integration into the airspace is going to affect [the pilots].” Rush joined the U.S. Army career in 1970 and, after receiving flight training at Fort Rucker, Alabama, served in South Korea for a year before leaving active duty. He then went to Alaska to fly 135 ops on the Alaska pipeline. He ultimately returned to Fort Rucker as a civilian flight instructor. Rush served 16 yr in the Army Reserve. Rush has been active in PHPA since he helped establish it in 2002; he became president in 2012. Rush said he jumped at the chance to join the drone committee.  “I think everybody’s going to have their say, and I’m sure they’ll come to consensus on all the issues,” Rush said of the members. “These are industry leaders across the spectrum. … The manufacturers, the regulatory people, the airline pilots are there, the helicopter pilots are there, so it’s going to be very interesting.”   The creation of the DAC stems from the successful stakeholder-based Unmanned Aircraft Systems Registration Task Force and the MicroUAS Aviation Rulemaking Committee. While they were established for a single purpose with limited duration, the FAA created the new committee as a long-lasting panel under the RTCA, a federal advisory committee. The drone group will help identify and prioritize integration challenges and improvements, including development of future regulations and policies. Modeled after the FAA’s NextGen Advisory Committee, the drone group is to meet at least three times a year.  Related News   Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Advertise with us Rotorcraft Jobs Search Jobs: Browse all jobs Post jobs Post Resume View Resumes Most Read Most Commented Webinar Focuses on Rotorcraft Boom, Near-Term Prospects 2008 Buyer’s Guide Directory Listings: Directory New Chicago Heliport Already Facing Noise Complaints Panel to Focus on Most Daunting Certification Challenges Sikorsky Seeks Innovative Kids GoPro Unveils Camera Drone In Bid to Save Stock Prices EASA Revision of SPI Regulation Continues How Operators Will Be Impacted by ICAO’s CORSIA Agreement Supersonic Avionics to Fly on ‘Baby Boom’ in 2017 New Report Outlines Avionics Equipage Issues for NextGen Do you receive The Rotorcraft Collective?

Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 vs 1070: specs and benchmarks compared by Mike Jennings 16 September 2016 0 shares Read Comments There’s no doubt that Nvidia is raising its game when it comes to high-end graphics. Both of its recent releases have been barnstormers, and there’s certainly no question over where you should look if you’re searching for an enthusiast GPU. At the top end, the choice isn't between Nvidia or AMD, but which GeForce card to opt for. There’s the flagship GTX 1080, which deploys the full clout of the Pascal architecture – but it costs almost £600. If your pockets aren't that deep then there's the GTX 1070, which comes in at a more palatable £380 – but it isn't as powerful. TrustedReviews put both of these GPUs through a comprehensive set of benchmarks to find out which is best – and I’ve taken a deep dive into board partner cards, prices and overclocking too. Of course, you know which is the more powerful of the two, but hopefully the comparisons outlined below will help you to decide which card is best for your needs. Let's get started. If you want to read our individual reviews, you can click here for the GTX 1080 and GTX 1070 reviews. Video: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 review Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 vs 1080 – Specs and Technology The two GTX cards share the same architecture, but they’re designed for different scenarios. The range-topping GTX 1080 is built for 4K, multi-monitor and VR. The GTX 1070 has enough grunt to handle VR and 1440 playback, but it isn't quite good enough for smooth 4K gaming. Th Pascal architecture around which both cards are based is a remarkable bit of design. Nvidia has slimmed down its manufacturing process from 28nm to 16nm, a shrinkage that has allowed the firm to fit more transistors into smaller spaces – and to deploy them on fins, rather than on mere horizontal planes. The result is that Nvidia is achieving far more with much less: the firm’s new cards include millions more transistors than previous GPUs, and on significantly smaller bits of silicon. The smoother flow of electricity allows for better GPU performance alongside surprisingly low power consumption. The two new cards deploy 7.2 billion transistors on a 314mm2 die, with peak power consumption figures of 150W and 180W. Their predecessors used 5.2 billion transistors on a 398mm2 die and drew a peak of 145W and 165W from the mains. Related: The best gaming PC specs to build yourself from £500 The GTX 1080 tops the range with 2,560 CUDA cores, while the GTX 1070 arrives with 1,920. Both cards tower over their predecessors: the GTX 980 had 2,048, while the GTX 970 had 1,664. Video: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 review The clock speeds are given a huge boost, too. The GTX 1080 zips along at 1,607MHz and the GTX 1070 is just 101MHz slower – both figures are hundreds of megahertz ahead of last year’s cards. The shared architecture across the cards mean they share Nvidia’s new software features. One of the key inclusions is “pre-emption”, which allows Nvidia’s card to pick and choose between graphics and computing workloads simultaneously. Both cards also have Lens Matched Shading, which saves resources by not rendering pixels that won’t be seen by the user. There’s simultaneous multi-projection, which allows the GPU to render a scene in as many as 16 different viewpoints – a boon for VR. Many of these features won’t be used to their full potential right now, but future games development will no doubt take advantage, especially when APIs such as DirectX 12 and Vulkan are better supported. The two cards diverge in the memory department. The GTX 1080 has 8GB of GDDR5X memory, while the GTX 1070 has 8GB of bog-standard GDDR5 RAM. The former memory is faster, with a 10,000MHz clock compared to the 8,000MHz in the GTX 1070. The GDDR5X memory has a 320-bit bus – wider than the 256-bit included on the GTX 1070.

It features the following components: Motherboard: Asus Z170-Deluxe Processor: Intel Core i5-6600K (not overclocked) RAM: Corsair Vengeance 2666MHz, 16GB DDR4 Cooler: Corsair H60 liquid cooler PSU: Corsair CX750M SSD: Samsung 850 EVO OS: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit I’ve tested these powerful cards with five different games. Each title is run at its highest settings, and I’ve tested each game at 1,920 x 1,080, 2,560 x 1,440 and 3,840 x 2,160 – 4K. I’ve also used a selection of synthetic benchmarks, with 3DMark’s demanding Fire Strike test alongside benchmarks to measure power consumption and peak temperature. DiRT Rally Ultra at 1,920 x 1,080 average GTX 1070: 134.7 GTX 1080: 154.8 Ultra at 2,560 x 1,440, average GTX 1070: 97.4 GTX 1080: 122.07 Ultra at 3,840 x 2,160, average GTX 1070: 52.5 GTX 1080: 63.2 There’s no denying that the GTX 1080 is faster than the GTX 1070, but there’s also no denying that both cards have the power to play DiRT Rally at any resolution. That’s no surprise, though: this is the easiest benchmark in the slate of test games. It’s fully representative of gameplay, and tests a GPU with complex lighting and rapid texture movement. Both cards destroyed the 1080p benchmark with average frame rates of 134.7fps and 154.8fps, and the GTX 1080 continued to average a three-figure result at 1440p with 122.07fps. The GTX 1070 was no slouch, either – it hit 97.4fps in the same run. The two Nvidia cards handle 3,840 x 2,160 with aplomb. The GTX 1070’s average of 52.5fps is excellent, and the GTX 1080 was almost 11 frames faster. Crucially, the pricier card got beyond the 60fps barrier that heralds butter-smooth gameplay. Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor Ultra at 1,920 x 1,080 average GTX 1070: 131.3 GTX 1080: 160.3 Ultra at 2,560 x 1,440, average GTX 1070: 89.8 GTX 1080: 112.3 Ultra at 3,840 x 2,160, average GTX 1070: 46.7 GTX 1080: 54.9 This game is tougher thanks to a multitude of environmental effects including weather, explosions and fire. The more challenging game didn’t stop Nvidia’s latest cards blowing away my 1080p test. Both flew past 130fps averages in the 1080p benchmark, and the GTX 1080 continued its good form at 2,560 x 1,440, where it averaged 112.32fps. The cheaper GeForce card impressed, too, with an average of 89.8fps. The two cards continued to perform well at 4K. The GTX 1080’s 54.9fps average is almost 10 frames beyond its cheaper stablemate, but I’ve no qualms about the GTX 1070’s ability to run this game smoothly at 4K. Grand Theft Auto V Ultra at 1,920 x 1,080 average GTX 1070: 104.2 GTX 1080: 113.4 Ultra at 2,560 x 1,440, average GTX 1070: 74.9 GTX 1080: 89.3 Ultra at 3,840 x 2,160, average GTX 1070: 39.3 GTX 1080: 47.3 GTA V’s benchmark is a hugely demanding test, with numerous scenes that cover driving, flying and plenty of other scenarios. Graphically, it's a demanding game, and here I test with every option run at maximum. This is another game where both cards handled every resolution, but it is in this trickier title where one card slipped below a 40fps average. The GTX 1070 averaged 39.3fps in GTA V at 4K, which is almost 10 frames behind the GTX 1080 – a playable score, but still a significant gap between the cards. There wasn’t as much space between the GPUs at 1440p, where the GTX 1070 registered a sterling 74.9fps average and the GTX 1080 delivered an 89.3fps result. And at 1080p, both cards excelled with averages beyond 100fps. It’s worth looking beyond the frame rates to see how the GTX 1080 flexes its extra CUDA core muscles. The GTX 1070 is only 8.11% behind the GTX 1080 at 1080p, but that gap increases to 16.13% at 1440p – and 16.91% at 4K. Hitman Max Settings at 1,920 x 1,080, average GTX 1070: 81.7 GTX 1080: 81.5 Max Settings at 2,560 x 1,440, average GTX 1070: 69.8 GTX 1080: 84 Max Settings at 3,840 x 2,160, average GTX 1070: 29.8 GTX 1080: 47.7 This benchmark stresses a PC’s processor and graphics card with a potent mix of objects, NPCs and lighting effects, and here it’s run at peak settings. I observed the GTX 1080’s widening lead across resolutions in GTA V, and that pattern is even more obvious in Hitman. There’s basically no difference between the two GPUs at 1080p, but the GTX 1080 is 16.93% faster at 1440p – and then 37.53% quicker at 3,840 x 2,160. This isn't the only bit of bad news for the GTX 1070. It rattled through Hitman’s 1080p and 1440p tests at good averages of 81.7fps and 69.8fps, but it faltered at 4K with an average of 29.8fps. That’s below the key 30fps figure, and its minimum frame rate will be even lower – which means that the game will stutter at this demanding resolution. The GTX 1080 had no such problems. It blitzed the 1080p and 1440p tests at 81.5fps and 84.03fps – its increase in speed a clear demonstration of the card flexing its muscles; and it handled 4K at 47.7fps. Rise of the Tomb Raider Max Settings at 1,920 x 1,080 average GTX 1070: 97.9 GTX 1080: 135.8 Max Settings at 2,560 x 1,440, average GTX 1070: 65.6 GTX 1080: 92.5 Max Settings at 3,840 x 2,160, average GTX 1070: 34 GTX 1080: 48.3 The intensive weather and lighting effects in this benchmark will strain even the beefiest graphics core, and I’ve run the game with every option turned up to the maximum level. In these tests the GTX 1080 rose to the occasion, with a 4K average of 48.3fps – and it ran at nearly 100fps when I dropped the resolution to 2,560 x 1,440. The GTX 1070 performed well, too – and certainly improved on its Hitman frame rates. Its 4K average of 34fps is back on the right side of 30fps, and it breezed through 60fps at 1440p. It almost hit 100fps at 1080p, too. In addition, the GTX 1070 was consistently slower than the GTX 1080 in this test, but the gap between the two cards sat at just below 30% in every test. That’s a better bill of health than its scores in the previous two games, where the GTX 1080 deployed its better memory and larger complement or stream processors to open a larger gap with every resolution increase. Synthetic Benchmarks, Power and Heat 3D Mark Fire Strike Ultra GTX 1070: 3,953 GTX 1080: 4,884 Peak power: GTX 1070: 229W GTX 1080: 286W Peak temperature: GTX 1070: 74°C GTX 1080: 75°C The 3DMark: Fire Strike test demonstrates the gulf in power between these two excellent cards. The GTX 1070 scored 3,953, but the GTX 1080 managed 4,884. The extra stream processors, higher clock and better memory clearly work wonders. The Fire Strike test also provides a firm demonstration of just how much better the new Nvidia hardware is when compared to earlier cards. The GTX 970 scored just 2,767 in this test, while the GTX 980 could manage only 3,286. My test rig consumed 229W with the GTX 1070 installed and 286W with the GTX 1080 on-board. These are fantastic figures considering the power on offer from these cards: the GTX 1070’s power draw is actually lower than the 260W requirement of the GTX 970, and the GTX 1080 is only 16W ahead of my GTX 980 rig. These figures will be even better when compared to older GPUs, and there are several benefits to having a more efficient GPU installed: less electricity is consumed, less heat is generated, and your PC will be quieter. There’s little to choose between peak temperatures – no surprise, seeing as I tested Nvidia’s Founders Edition hardware, which is the same across both chips. The GTX 1080’s 75°C peak was one degree warmer than the GTX 1070. Performance Conclusions There’s no doubt about it: Nvidia’s latest two GPU releases secure its position at the top of the graphics market – at least until AMD unveils some more powerful cards based on its new Polaris architecture. The GTX 1070 and GTX 1080 are both hugely powerful. They both rattled through 1080p and 1440p benchmarks without breaking a sweat, and both have enough power to handle VR. Head towards the high-end, though, and the GTX 1080 starts to justify its higher price. The GTX 1070 dipped below 30fps in one 4K test, and its lower averages in some of those benchmarks mean its minimums will be slower – and that means juddering gameplay. The GTX 1080 had no such problems, with far smoother 4K performance. I also observed the GTX 1080 opening wider leads on its stablemate as resolutions became trickier. That’s testament to its superior specification, and it means the GTX 1080 is a better bet for 4K and multi-monitor setups – and for VR, where its extra power adds a layer of future-proofing. Both cards easily outpaced their predecessors and both did so with impressive noise and power consumption figures. Nvidia has done a sterling job with the Pascal architecture, and it means these two cards are both worth considering. The GTX 1070 is a superb choice for 1080p and 1440p gaming, while the GTX 1080 is fantastic for 4K, multi-monitor setups and smooth VR. Buy Now: GTX 1080 at Amazon.com from $599.99 Best Deals for Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Overclocking and SLI Nvidia reckons there’s ample headroom for overclocking on both cards thanks to GPU Boost 3.0, which provides more granular control over core and memory frequencies and voltages. It was possible to achieve decent gains from both cards. I added 220MHz and 260MHz to the GTX 1070’s core and memory clocks, which saw an average improvement of around 6fps in my games tests. The GTX 1080 saw its core and memory clocks rise by 200MHz and 189MHz, which delivered about five more frames in the test games. The situation surrounding SLI is a little trickier. Nvidia is allowing gamers to use two cards in SLI, but if you’d like to go further then you’ll have to register with Nvidia to receive an unlock code. This is a new approach, but I can’t see it hampering many gamers – the performance of these cards mean that there’s little need to go beyond two GPUs, and the driver issues and diminishing returns of three- and four-card SLI means I can’t wholeheartedly recommend that approach. Other Things to Consider Nvidia launched both of these GPUs with its Founders Edition hardware, which was far more expensive than board partner cards yet actually offered very little. That extra spend got you the kudos of being first in the queue alongside Nvidia’s admittedly excellent metallic card design, but nothing else. Thankfully, there’s now no need to spend all that extra cash on the Founders Edition cards – board partners have unleashed their own versions of the new GPUs. There’s already huge variety in the marketplace. Prices for air-cooled cards range from £380 to £500, and beyond that there are cards with waterblocks fitted for liquid cooling. Even the cheapest cards come with modest overclocks, and spending around £420 could net you a card with a GPU at 1,620MHz or 1,670MHz and memory overclocked to 8,500MHz. Many GTX 1070s use Nvidia’s sturdy reference design, but plenty more deploy a greater number of fans and different heatsinks. There’s even a tiny mini-ITX version, and a card with a pre-built water-cooling unit attached. Unlike the GTX 1070, the GTX 1080 doesn’t have smaller versions of the card available, but the market is well stocked with reference and third-party designs. Prices range between £590 and £750, and overclocked models are common. These tweaked cores often run at speeds beyond 1,700MHz, with memory tweaked to 10,500MHz. Verdict There’s plenty to like about both of these GPUs – and they’re both worth considering for different scenarios. The GTX 1070 is an exceptional card for 1080p and 1440p gaming, and it has ample power for VR. It does this while consuming less power than its predecessor, and I’ve seen that overclocking yields impressive results too.

The problem is they only offer the bare 1080. not a FTW version. I cant see myself upgrading and spending about 200 dollars more for a card that I feel only gives me a slight boost over the 1070 FTW card. Has anyone done comparisons to see how the FTW version stands up to the regular 1080 version? Hacker4748 October 28, 2016, 7:55 pm Quote from the article: --------------------------- Max Settings at 2,560 x 1,440, average GTX 1070: 69.8 GTX 1080: 84 Max Settings at 3,840 x 2,160, average GTX 1070: 29.8 GTX 1080: 47.7 [..] the GTX 1080 is 16.93% faster at 1440p – and then 37.53% quicker at 3,840 x 2,160. --------------------------- This is not how % calculations work. Example: 150 FPS is 50 % (not 33.33%) faster than 100 FPS. So at 1440p the 1080 is 20.34% faster and at 3,840 x 2,160 it is 60.07% faster.

The Santa Clara, California, company has been hurt by slowing sales of personal computers that use its chips. In April, the company said it would cut 12,000 jobs as it reorganizes its business. Intel has been trying to grow other segments, such as its data center management unit. On Friday, Intel said it now expects third-quarter revenue of $15.6 billion, plus or minus $300 million. It previously expected revenue of $14.9 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Wall Street analysts expected revenue of $14.9 billion, according to FactSet. Shares of Intel Corp. rose 82 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $37.38 in afternoon trading Friday. Intel shares are up more than 25 percent over the past year. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Add A Comment For those looking to live on the edge of Mesa development, there are some new patch series out this morning, particularly of interest if you are using the AMD RadeonSI Gallium3D driver for GCN GPUs. First off AMD's Nicolai Hähnle sent out the patches laying the foundation for 64-bit integer support in Gallium3D. This work is based on the original work done by David Airlie. This work lays out the 64-bit integer support for TGSI (the Gallium3D IR) and the Gallium3D drivers. Beyond adding the new opcodes and types for 64-bit ints, support is wired up for Softpipe, LLVMpipe, and then the RadeonSI driver for 64-bit integers. However, this work ultimately won't be too beneficial until Intel's Ian Romanick lands his patches for exposing the GL_ARB_gpu_shader_int64 extension inside Mesa. But Nicolai is hoping to land these patches soon before that ARB_gpu_shader_int64 support even lands in Mesa. Nicolai followed that int64 patch series with ARB_query_buffer_object for RadeonSI. The ARB_query_buffer_object for RadeonSI depends upon having the 64-bit integer support as a prerequisite. ARB_query_buffer_object is one of the few extensions still blocking RadeonSI from having OpenGL 4.4 support. Plus there's been the usual slew of other Mesa-dev patches as well as AMDGPU DRM patches on amd-gfx to make it as an exciting time as ever for riding the bleeding-edge open-source graphics driver code.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: U.S. stocks fell on Friday as the possibility of a US$14 billion fine against Deutsche Bank weighed on big banks and investors wrestled with lingering uncertainty about when the U.S. Federal Reserve will hike interest rates. The settlement proposal, made during negotiations between the U.S. Department of Justice and Deutsche Bank over claims that the German bank missold mortgage-backed securities, was larger than expected. Deutsche Bank's U.S.-listed shares slumped 9.35 percent. Dow components Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan fell over 1 percent each. The S&P 500 financial index dropped 0.91 percent, dragging down the benchmark index the most. The KBW Bank index fell 1.11 percent and logged its second straight week of declines. Traders have all but ruled out the possibility of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates at its meeting that starts next Tuesday. But residual doubts and questions about when the Fed may finally pull the trigger still hurt sentiment. "It's the uncertainty of next week, the complacency of investors trying to re-evaluate their portfolios as we prepare for an interest-rate hike," said Jeff Carbone, co-founder of Cornerstone Financial Partners in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.49 percent to finish at 18,123.80 points and the S&P 500 fell 0.38 percent to 2,139.16. The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.1 percent to 5,244.57. With futures and options contracts expiring, about 9.3 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 6.6 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. For the week, the Dow edged up 0.2 percent, the S&P gained 0.5 percent and the Nasdaq jumped 2.3 percent. The technology index on Friday dropped 0.33 percent, pulled down by Apple's 0.56-percent decline and Oracle's 4.75-percent drop following weak quarterly profit. Helping limit losses was Intel's 3.04-percent gain to a 15-year high after the chipmaker raised its third-quarter revenue forecast. The CBOE Market Volatility index , Wall Street's "fear gauge", declined 5.7 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.79-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.18-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 5 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 88 new highs and 50 new lows.

The recent trigger that has brought up rate hike worries all over again is the U.S. consumer price inflation report for August, which came in more than expected, signaling that there is some scope for upward maneuvering of rates. Commodities are all in the red, as the dollar is firming up. In the absence of any major catalysts, traders may prefer to be on the sidelines or lighten their holdings ahead of next week's two major central bank decisions. U.S. stocks advanced solidly on Thursday, with tempered rate hike fears serving as a spring board for the markets to rebound from recent weakness. The major averages opened higher, as traders digested a slew of soft domestic data, which allayed fears concerning a near-term interest rate hike. The averages rose steadily before ending notably higher. The Dow Industrials added 177.71 points or 0.99 percent before ending at 18,213, the S&P 500 Index closed 21.49 points or 1.01 percent higher at 2,147 and the Nasdaq Composite ended at 5,250, up 75.92 points or 1.47 percent. All thirty Dow components closed the session higher, with Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Merck (MRK), Microsoft (MSFT), UnitedHealth (UNH), Caterpillar (CAT), Wal-Mart (WMT) and Procter & Gamble (PG) leading the gains. Among the sectors, semiconductor, computer hardware, brokerage, energy and biotechnology stocks showed notable moves to the upside. On the economic front, the Labor Department reported that jobless claims rose to 260,000 in the week ended September 10th from 259,000 in the previous week. The four-week average eased to 260,750 from 261,250. Continuing claims calculated with a week's lag were little changed at 2.143 million in the week ended September 3rd. The Commerce Department reported that retail sales slipped 0.3 percent month-over-month in August following a revised 0.1 percent gain in July. Excluding autos, retail sales declined a more modest 0.1 percent compared to the 0.4 percent decline in July. Auto sales fell 0.9 percent following July's 1.7 percent jump. The decline in building material and garden equipment store sales steepened to 1.4 percent from 0.7 percent. Miscellaneous store and non-store retail sales also saw notable decreases. However, the drop in furniture and home furnishing store sales slowed to 0.7 percent from 1.1 percent and electronic store sales rebounded by 0.1 percent. Food and beverage sales rebounded. Gasoline store sales fell at a slower pace of 0.8 percent. A separate Commerce Department report showed that business inventories remained virtually unchanged in July compared to the previous month. Annually, inventories climbed 0.5 percent. Business sales edged down 0.2 percent month-over-month and were 0.8 percent lower from last year. The business inventories/sales ratio rose to 1.39 in July from 1.37 in the year-ago period. The Labor Department report on producer prices showed tame inflationary pressure. The producer price index for final demand was unchanged in August compared to the previous month, while economists expected a 0.1 percent increase. The core producer price index for final demand rose at a faster 0.3 percent clip compared to a flat reading in June. The results of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's business outlook survey showed that its diffusion index of business activity rose sharply to 12.8 in September from 2 in August. However, the inner details were mixed. The new orders index rose to 1.4 from -7.2, while the unfilled orders index was at an anemic -10.8. The shipments index and the employee index were also in negative territory. Meanwhile, the New York Federal Reserve's survey showed that manufacturing activity in the region continued to contract in September. The general business conditions index improved to -1.99 in September from -4.21 in August, while economists expected a reading of -1. The new orders and unfilled orders indexes were at -7.45 and -11.61, respectively. The employment index is deep in the red at -14.29. Industrial production fell 0.4 month-over-month in August, according to a report released by the Federal Reserve. Economists expect a 0.2 percent drop. Manufacturing output also declined 0.4 percent, reversing the 0.4 percent increase in July and steeper than the 0.3 percent drop expected by economists. Capacity utilization eased 0.4 percentage points to 75.5 percent. Currency, Commodity Markets Crude oil futures for October delivery are slipping $0.83 to $43.08 barrel after rising $0.33 to $43.91 a barrel on Thursday. Gold futures are currently trading at $1,312.80 an ounce, down $5 from the previous session's close of $1,318 an ounce, which represented a 2-week low. On Thursday, gold fell $8. 10. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 102.01 yen compared to the 102.10 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Thursday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1201 compared to yesterday's $1.1244. Asia Asian stocks rebounded from a six-week low, encouraged by Wall Street's rally overnight. The markets in China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, South Korea and Taiwan were closed for public holidays. The Japanese market rose as the yen remained subdued at the lower 102-levels. The Nikkei 225 Index opened higher and moved roughly sideways in a broad range in the morning before advancing in the afternoon. The index ended up 114.28 points or 0.70 percent at 16,519. The Australian market rose for a third straight day, as easing Fed rate hike worries helped lift stocks across the board. The All Ordinaries index closed up 59.60 points or 1.12 percent at 5,397. The market witnessed broad based strength, with utility, telecom, consumer discretionary and financial stocks making strong advances. Europe The European markets moved about in a lackluster manner in the morning after rebounding from a 5-session decline yesterday. The averages opened higher but saw a volatile bout in the morning. The averages are currently notably lower, as U.S. inflation data has served to intensify the weakness. In major corporate news, Deutsche Bank (DB) said it has no intent to pay the $14 billion sought by the U.S. Justice Department to settle potential civil claims anywhere near the number cited. U.S. Economic Reports Consumer prices in the U.S. increased by slightly more than expected in the month of August, according to a report released by the Labor Department. The Labor Department said its consumer price index rose by 0.2 percent in August after coming in unchanged in July. Economists had expected prices to inch up by 0.1 percent. Excluding food and energy prices, core consumer prices climbed by 0.3 percent in August after edging up by 0.1 percent in July. Core prices had been expected to rise by 0.2 percent. The University of Michigan is scheduled to release its preliminary U.S. consumer sentiment index for September at 10 am ET. The index is expected to increase to 90.8 from 89.8.

Credit: Apple More like this Apple’s iPhone 7 gets even closer to the desktop iPhone 2016: All the latest speculation in one place 13 reasonable iPad Pro 2 rumors Video Mingis on Tech: The iPhone 7, Apple Watch 2 -- and the gadget guy! It’s iPhone 7 upgrade day for Apple customers around the planet and we’re seeing the usual queues and swiftly sold out enthusiasm we’ve seen every year, with initial reports from carriers suggesting the company has a smash hit on its hands (again). Apple’s new iPhone 7 is waterproof, has a new camera, better screen and a better battery. So, as the first handsets reach real people’s hands, what else are we learning about the smartphone? The Taptic tease The annual iFixit iPhone teardown confirms that the removal of the headphone jack has provided the space Apple needed in order to place the Taptic Engine. The area also hosts a simple plastic bumper, which suggests another reason for the removal of that port was improvement in water resistance. The new model iPhones also open sideways, which the teardown specialists suggest may also help improve water resistance. Water resistance All the teardowns confirm Apple has paid a lot of attention to water resistance, but how resistant will it be? Find out from about 8.30am PDT when iFixit begins its live YouTube video cast of an iPhone submerged in an aquarium. That superb processor The latest Geekbench figures were reported earlier but they are so significant I thought I’d include them here: iPhone 7 has double the single-core performance of the fastest Android smartphones. When it comes to multicore performance they are similar to the 2013 MacBook Pro – in other words, these are proper computers in your pocket. In related news with its Note 7 debacle it looks like Samsung is (rightfully) limping into the history books, Apple has at last replaced it as processor manufacturer in the A10 Fusion chip, which is made by TSMC. The M10 motion coprocessor is embedded within the chip. (Samsung still gets to make some memory for the iPhone, 3GB in fact). More time than ever In comparison to the previous generation the new iPhones should deliver over an hour of additonal battery life. That’s because the battery is 1,960 mAh, 3.8 V and 7.45 watt hours in comparison to the iPhone 6S which hosted a 1,810 mAh, 6.9 Wh battery. (The 7 Plus features a 2,900mAh battery according to iFixit). Tougher than before The Apple smartphone has already been put through rigorous stress testing by one YouTuber, who managed to prove iPhone 7 is tough. It’s less likely to scratch than a Note, the Home button and camera lens are similarly tough. The iPhone also managed to completely recover from being exposed to flame, even though its pixels briefly went black, and while the phone may need a quick visit to a repair shop to fix broken adhesive it can take a good degree of bending too. (A little) Intel inside Chipworks got hold of an iPhone 7 and tore it apart to find the LTE modem inside the smartphone is made by Intel, though this may not be true in the case of every handset. This wasn’t all the Intel “stuff” inside of the phone, which also hosts two transceivers and a power management chip from the company. (Qualcomm also makes these components for Apple). The tear down shop took apart an iPhone aimed at the North American market. Anyone else inside? These are the names of all the companies with identified components inside the iPhone.

As filter feeders, oysters’ edibility depends highly on water quality, and when rain causes flooding into the estuaries where the molluscs are farmed, they may pick up contaminants that can pose a potential risk of food poisoning for consumers. As a result, when there is a perceived risk, regulations mean oyster farms must close for days or weeks until conditions improve, which can cause business owners to forego revenues of up to $120,000 for each day harvest is held back. Furthermore, the spread of the virus causing Pacific oyster mortality syndrome (POMS) has devastated some oyster farming businesses. One such enterprise, Tasmania’s Barilla Bay Oysters – once one of the state’s largest oyster farmers – saw 70% of its harvest wiped out by POMS in February of this year. The Yield’s oyster farming application, which was developed in partnership with Bosch, sends data from in-estuary sensors via an Intel gateway to Bosch’s ProSyst software. From there it is then passed to Microsoft’s IoT hub in the Microsoft Azure cloud along with weather data. The environmental data and near real-time sensor data is combined and presented to oyster growers and regulators to enable faster decision-making based on local information. The app delivers informative dashboard visualisations for the previous week, the current day and for the following day. Microsoft Azure machine learning is also employed to drive The Yield’s predictive algorithms which underpin the Yield’s application, according to Microsoft. According to Lloyd Klump, General Manager of BioSecurity Tasmania, The Yield’s solution is important in ensuring food safety, as well as managing the response to POMS. “Even for a smaller grower a day’s closure in a busy season can be very significant. But there are indirect impacts also, Tasmania relies on these sorts of industries for local communities,” Klump said. The Tasmanian oyster industry is worth around $23 million a year, but due its associated community employment, oyster farming influences a larger share of the state’s economic infrastructure than that figure suggests. “Anything we can do to help the sustainability is important for Tasmanian communities and the economy,” said Klump. Ros Harvey, founder and CEO of The Yield explained that the underlying technologies could also have much broader implications for farming generally – for example allowing crop growers to know exactly when and how to irrigate. “We actually have a really clear purpose which is how we’re going to help feed the world without wrecking the planet,” she said.

Yes. It’s good to see it again. We were very taken indeed with the 2015 edition of this compact notebook, awarding it a full five stars in our review and heaping praise on its design – that near-borderless monitor really keeps the size down. And now it’s getting a 2016 update, complete with new seventh-generation Intel Core processors and a new colour option. Is it... rose gold?  Of course it’s bloody rose gold! The gadget gods have decreed that every product released in 2016 must come with a gold-but-also-a-wee-bit-pink finish, and the XPS 13 is no exception. OK, so there’s a new colour – but let’s get back to those specs. Indeed. Well, the new model comes with a choice of new i3, i5 and i7 Intel chips, and better battery life than its predecessor (Dell says 13 hours if you’re Netflix streaming or web browsing, 22 if you’re just using productivity apps), higher speed Wi-Fi and a Thunderbolt 3 port that’ll allow a single XPS 13 to power two external 4K displays, as well as single-cable docking. Anything else? Aside from the above, the specs are unchanged from last year’s edition. The base model features a 13.3in 1080p screen, Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM and 128GB of solid-state storage, and upgrades can take that to a 3200 x 1800 touchscreen, 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. Price and availability? There’s no sign of the new model on Dell’s UK site yet, but in the US the 2016 XPS 13 starts at US$799, although you’ll need to pay more (US$1149) for the rose gold model.

VirtualBox is a high-performance, cross-platform virtualization engine for use on computers running Windows, Linux distributions, and others. Designed for use on Intel and AMD x86 systems, VM VirtualBox can be deployed on desktop or server hardware. As a hosted hypervisor, it extends the existing operating system installed on the hardware rather than replacing it. VirtualBox includes a hypervisor for the host platform, an application programming interface (API) and software development kit (SDK) for managing guest virtual machines, a command-line tool for managing guests locally, a web service for remote management of guests, a wizard-style graphical tool to manage guests, a graphical console for displaying guest applications on the local host, and a built-in Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) server that provides complete access to a guest from a remote client. VirtualBox Architecture VirtualBox API = VBoxMananger = CLI VBoxMananger is the command line interface to VirtualBox. If you put a command from VBoxMananger into the console, is possible see all commands and how they interact with the VirtualBox API. The command to list all VMs is: $ VBoxManage list vms It is possible to create VMs with the command line, but is necessary to have ISO to the system operation that you want installed. Step 1: Step 2: VBoxMananger is the tool that Vagrant uses for samples to create environments. VirtualBox Network There are three types of networks: NAT with port forwarding. Bridged networking. Internal networking. Host-only networking. NAT Networking NAT = Networking Address Translation. Each VM has your own sub-network with your public IP. Share the same resources of that host. VMs cannot see each other. IP, Gateway, and DNS cannot be changed. Bridged Networking VMs and the host are in the same network. VMs have access to the physical network in the same way the host does. Can be found in the physical network. Internal Networking Isolated network. Only VMs are within a private network. Host can’t see the private network. Host-Only Networking Hybrid between bridge and internal networks. Private Network to the host and VMs. VMs can’t see external networks. Host has private IP to the internal network. Conclusion In this post, I focused on one difficult point people I know tend to bring up (VirtualBox API and VirtualBox Network). These solutions are what worked for me.

The vmlens executor service is a high throughput executor service. It achieves three times higher throughput than the standard JDK executor service. The tradeoff is that the latency is much higher than that of the standard JDK executor service. Here are my benchmark results: The figure shows the throughput of the vmlens executor Service compared to the standard JDK executor service for different threads on JDK 8. The figure shows the latency of the vmlens executor Service compared to the standard JDK executor service for different threads on JDK 8. Both benchmarks were run with jmh on an Intel i5 4-core CPU. The source of the benchmark can be downloaded here. A Wait-Free Algorithm for Writing The basic Idea is that writing should be as fast as possible. The vmlens executor Service uses a thread local field to store its last written queue node. So writing consists of creating a new QueueNode, writing to a thread local field and writing to the volatile QueueNode next field. public class QueueManyWriters

The vmlens executor service is a high throughput executor service. It achieves three times higher throughput than the standard JDK executor service. The tradeoff is that the latency is much higher than that of the standard JDK executor service. Here are my benchmark results: The figure shows the throughput of the vmlens executor Service compared to the standard JDK executor service for different threads on JDK 8. The figure shows the latency of the vmlens executor Service compared to the standard JDK executor service for different threads on JDK 8. Both benchmarks were run with jmh on an Intel i5 4-core CPU. The source of the benchmark can be downloaded here. A Wait-Free Algorithm for Writing The basic Idea is that writing should be as fast as possible. The vmlens executor Service uses a thread local field to store its last written queue node. So writing consists of creating a new QueueNode, writing to a thread local field and writing to the volatile QueueNode next field. public class QueueManyWriters
private final ThreadLocal lastWrittenQueueNode
= new ThreadLocal();

public void accept(E element)

	if( dispatcherThread.stop )

What's more, he said, there is a store in Berlin which openly sells Daesh (ISIS/ISIL/Islamic State) paraphernalia. Such stores are located all across Germany, including in Frankfurt, Mainz, Wuppertal, Berlin and Bremen. The exact number of stores has yet to be revealed, but it will almost certainly increase in the near future, according to Ourghi. He said that these stores sell not only clothes designed to completely cover women's faces and bodies, but also special clothing for men and boys which symbolizes membership in the Salafi community. Qurghi underscored that the purpose of opening such stores is not only aimed at gaining economic benefits. © Flickr/ thierry ehrmann A Daesh flag He said that "if you look closely, it becomes clear that an Islamist-Salafist propaganda structure stands behind all of this given that in these stores they sell goods with extremist symbols, which is expressed in certain relevant inscriptions and colors." "One of these stores is located on Flughafenstrasse Street in Berlin's Neukolln district, where they sell, for example, a black colored ring with Daesh symbols. In other words, we are witnessing the promotion of Islamic extremism," Qurghi said. Notably, the store, which is located near a local mosque, is known to be a meeting point for Salafists, he said, adding that the Salafist network's goal is to establish closer ties between the Salaphis and re-Islamize young Muslims who are already integrated into German society. Additionally, he claims this network has been linked to the Salafi extremist community.  "The owner of a similar store in Frankfurt is the daughter of a Salafi preacher from Morocco. We are concerned about the fact that Germany is seeing the beginning of the popularization of a Salafi culture of consumption," Qurghi said. He also drew attention to the fact that these stores sell niqabs for two-year old girls, something that he said can be seen as political and Salafi methods to manipulate children. According to him, such an approach is competing with Western values and accepted standards for the socialization of children in Germany, helping to create a so-called "parallel society." "We cannot generalize by claiming that all Muslims who wear clothing that hides the face and entire body are extremists. But in any case, these stores are a new phenomenon in Germany," he said adding that these stores are already selling niqab-clad dolls. Qurghi added that the German government should keep a watchful eye on these stores, which he said help establish links between Muslims living in Germany and teach them Salafism. © AP Photo/ Khalid Mohammed Military Defeats in Middle East Prompt Daesh to Focus on EuropeMeanwhile, German security agencies have estimate that thousands of EU-born Islamist militants may be on their way home soon after fighting intensified in Syria and Iraq, German media reports said. "The return of jihadists presents a threat to security," German criminal police chief Holger Muench said. "The majority are extremely radicalized, they have military training and are battle-hardened." German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said in an interview with the newspaper Bild last week that over 500 potential Islamist attackers were estimated to be living in Germany, and cautioned about the threat emerging from small strike groups and lone-wolf terrorists. ...

W hen it was released in 2015, the Apple MacBook was so thin and light as to be a revelation. At a shade over 900g and 13.1mm thick when closed, this 12in laptop was slimmer, lighter and had a smaller footprint than the 11in MacBook Air.  However, any portable design brings inevitable compromise, and the first-generation MacBook wore those on its sleek metallic sleeve. Battery life was nothing more than average; performance worse still. The keyboard, with its super-shallow travel, also divided opinion.  The 2015 MacBook, then, was great if you valued portability above all else. As it happens, it fitted my needs perfectly – the closest I come to being a “power user” is modest audio and video editing – and I bought one. The question is, will this 2016 update – with a new, faster processor – fix the frustrations? Understated design To moderate expectations, let’s be clear from the start: this is one of the company’s “press release-only” updates. There was no event, no product managers on stage, no Tim Cook proclaiming how “gorgeous” the new MacBook is. This is understandable, for nothing about the MacBook’s design has changed. If you’ve picked one up, you’ll know exactly what to expect. The screen is still gorgeous, albeit not bezel-free like the edge-to-edge “infinity” display on Dell’s XPS 13. As before, you can buy the MacBook in Space Grey, Silver and Gold, and Apple is also making it available in Rose Gold (Apple’s rebranding of “pink”). Subjectively, this is a laptop that weighs almost nothing. At under a kilo, you can throw the MacBook into any bag and barely notice it’s there. Impressively, however, the body feels robust and taut; it doesn’t creak or flex at all. This is the kind of high-end engineering on which Apple has built its success. Little has changed when it comes to the 2,304 x 1,440 display, either. It’s still a great screen with a wide colour gamut covering 94.2% of the sRGB colour space. It’s even bright enough to be used outdoors on a sunny day – although, notably, it isn’t as bright as the previous version. In tests, it reached a maximum brightness of 335cd/m2 versus last year’s 381cd/m2. Contrast ratio is down as well, from 1,063:1 to 805:1.  However, there’s an upside: Apple claims it uses less power than last year’s display, and it still looks great to the naked eye. Yes, it’s only 12in, but having grown used to this size over the past year, I’d be happy to work on this screen for a full day. As with all Apple Retina laptops, it has a default setting that mimics something with fewer pixels – in this case, the Default setting “looks like 1,280 x 800”. You can run at other modes, from 1,024 x 640 to 2,560 x 1,600. All of these modes look fine, although higher resolutions tend to make things look incredibly small on a 12in screen. No moving parts Another thing that hasn’t changed is the fanless design. Apple sticks with Intel’s Core M processors, this time offering a range of Skylake options; I was sent the model with the Core m5-6Y54, but there are also m7 and m3 options. All the new models are fanless, meaning they retain the MacBook’s “no moving parts” approach. Even the trackpad doesn’t move – although you’ll think it does. As with all Apple trackpads these days, it’s big and feels great, employing Apple’s ingenious Force Touch system. Press down on the trackpad and sensors detect how much pressure is being applied; electromagnets then provide haptic feedback, which makes it feel as if the trackpad is being pressed downwards physically. It’s a spooky feeling when, after using the trackpad for a while, you try pressing down on it when the machine is turned off and realise it’s just a solid, immovable piece of glass. The keys on the keyboard do move, although, as with the previous version, this is something that’s likely to polarise opinion. In a move designed to slim down the physical thickness of the keyboard, there’s significantly less travel here than on conventional laptop keyboards. The best advice I can give is to try it before you run out and buy a MacBook. Some will find it perfectly acceptable – there are those I’ve talked to who even prefer it – or you’ll react with visceral hatred and want to throw the machine out of the window every time you use it. Best to work out which before you spend $1,999. The other big, controversial feature of the MacBook range concerns physical connectivity. There’s a single USB Type-C port, a headphone/mic jack – and that’s it. The USB Type-C port charges the laptop and provides all the connectivity, bar audio. And yes, that means you can’t connect a peripheral and charge the machine at the same time without using some kind of multi-port dongle. If you’re the sort of person who likes to plug in an external keyboard, mouse and monitor when you’re using your laptop at your desk, be aware that you’ll need to budget extra cash for connectors. The USB Type-C standard is clearly the future, and the advantages of using it are obvious, but having only a single port makes life more difficult than it should be. Why Apple couldn’t make space for a second or third port is something only its designers can answer. All-day battery? Here’s the good news: the 2016 MacBook is definitely faster than its predecessor. The bad news is it isn’t noticeable in day-to-day use. It’s slower than any other currently available Mac we’ve benchmarked. That said, subjectively, it’s fine for light work. I used the MacBook for editing Office documents, web browsing, a bit of photo editing and some (very) light video and audio editing – and it performed perfectly well. If you spend all your time in Photoshop or CAD applications, this isn’t the Mac for you; but, if that’s the case, what on earth are you doing considering a machine with a 12in screen anyway? The biggest change is the battery life. My MacBook has been my main machine for a year, and I’ve always been a little disappointed: starting at 9am, I usually get to 2pm or 3pm before having to reach for my charger. Our tests on the previous model delivered 7hrs 10mins of battery, with Wi-Fi off and the screen turned down to 170cd/m2. This time round, that figure rose to a far more impressive 10hrs 12mins – a significant improvement. The new MacBook might not make it all the way to 5pm, but it gets a whole lot closer than its older sibling. Don’t rush to buy The MacBook answers the question, “What would happen if you mated a MacBook Air with an iPad?”. It’s a Mac, running OS X, but the design and feel of the product is heavily influenced by the iPad. It’s the first Mac I’ve used where OS features that have been ported over from iOS, such as full and split-screen apps, actually make sense. With the 2016 model, the MacBook is better than ever. It delivers a significant uplift in battery life, a minor but welcome increase in performance and, for those who want everything in Rose Gold, wider colour options. It’s an iterative improvement, but iterative improvements can turn good products into truly great ones. Iteration, not revolution, is the most important force in technology today. Like the original Apple MacBook Air, however, it feels like too many sacrifices have been made at the altar of design. Just a little bit more performance, and maybe an extra USB Type-C port, would have made this a far more tempting proposition. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t buy one. If your needs are relatively light, and you value design and portability over all else, then you’ll love the MacBook. But you’ll also find yourself grimacing when you realise you’ve left the vital dongle you need to connect a monitor and power simultaneously at home. At least with this generation, you’ll get closer to all-day battery life from a single overnight charge.   Related Reviews Review: Dell Inspiron 15 5000 2-in-1 Review: Dell Inspiron 13 5000 2-in-1 delivers quality over battery Review: HP EliteBook Folio G1 - great looks, terrible battery life Review: Dell Latitude 13 7370 Source: Copyright © PC & Tech Authority, nextmedia Pty Ltd Copyright © Alphr, Dennis Publishing See more about:  apple macbook  |  laptop  |  macbook  |  macbook air  |  review   Tweet Email this Print this Feedback   Readers of this article also read...   Gallery: The PCs of PAX Australia 2016     How should we teach our kids to use digital media?     Report identifies path from online gaming to cyber-criminality     Patriot announces two 200GB SD cards     Top 50 Horror Characters of All Time   NOTE: You must be a registered member of PC & Tech Authority to post a comment.

Investors looked over a series of mixed economic reports as they sought clues about the Federal Reserve’s intentions and the health of the economy. Technology companies made the largest gains as Apple rose for the fourth consecutive day. It’s up 12 percent this week on growing optimism about early sales of its newest iPhones. Energy companies bounced back after two rough days, though the price of oil rose only a small amount. Health care and phone company stocks also climbed. Bond yields wobbled and finished little changed, a sign investors aren’t sure what will happen with interest rates. It was the fourth big move for the market in the past five days as investors try to anticipate whether the Fed will raise interest rates next week. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 177.71 points, or 1 percent, to 18,212.48. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index jumped 21.49 points, or 1 percent, to 2,147.26. The Nasdaq composite gained 75.92 points, or 1.5 percent, to 5,249.69. Apple rose to its highest price in 10 months on reports of strong preorders for the new iPhones it introduced last week. The stock added $3.80, or 3.4 percent, to $115.57. Other technology companies also rose. Microsoft gained 93 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $57.19 and Intel picked up 94 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $36.56. Strong gains for technology and health care companies have the Nasdaq on pace for its best week since late June. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 33 cents to $43.91 per barrel in New York. It fell almost 6 percent in the past two days. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 74 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $46.59 a barrel in London. Among energy stocks, Marathon Petroleum rose $1.87, or 4.5 percent, to $43.74 and Chevron gained $1.08, or 1.1 percent, to $99.50. Investors pored over a series of economic reports. The Labor Department said producer prices fell in August as gas and food prices declined. Lower producer prices reduce inflation, and the Fed has said it wants to see evidence inflation is edging upward before it raises rates. Inflation has remained consistently low in recent years. Reports by the Commerce Department and the Federal Reserve, respectively, showed that retail sales fell last month and factory production decreased as well. Bond prices wobbled. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 1.70 percent. Among companies in the news, Goodyear Tire & Rubber climbed after the company boosted its dividend and said it plans to return $4 billion to shareholders over the next few years. The stock rose $1.58, or 5.1 percent, to $32.39. Aerie Pharmaceuticals surged $9.48, or 44.9 percent, to $30.61 after the company reported positive results from a late-stage trial of Roclatan, an experimental glaucoma drug. AMC Networks fell $1.44, or 2.8 percent, to $50.53 after Stifel Nicolaus analyst Benjamin Mogil downgraded the company because competition is growing and ratings for its hit “The Walking Dead” may weaken as the show enters its seventh season. Wells Fargo lost 37 cents to $46.15. Regulators said last week that the bank opened more than 2 million accounts that customers may not have authorized and transferred money into those accounts without their approval. The company agreed to pay a $185 million fine and says it will cut back on aggressive sales targets, but the controversy is damaging its reputation. The stock is mired in a five-day losing streak that has pulled its value down 7.5 percent. The price of gold fell $8.10 to $1,318 an ounce and silver lost 3 cents to $19.04 an ounce. Copper remained at $2.16 a pound. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline jumped 7 cents, or 5 percent, to $1.43 a gallon. Heating oil rose 3 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $1.42 a gallon. Natural gas added 4 cents to $2.93 per 1,000 cubic feet. The dollar slid to 102.16 yen from 102.42 yen. The euro dipped to $1.1246 from $1.1249. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares traded 0.9 percent higher. Germany’s DAX rose 0.5 percent while the CAC 40 of France edged up 0.1 percent. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 tumbled 1.3 percent while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 0.6 percent.

By Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols | September 15, 2016 -- 23:57 GMT (16:57 PDT) | Topic: Developer Dronecode, the non-profit organization developing a common, shared open-source platform for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), aka drones, has recently made management decisions that has led to some programmers picking up their code and flying away. ArduPilot is taking its code and forking from Dronecode. Andrew "Tridge" Tridgell, one of the Samba file server creators and a founder of ArduPilot, an open-source drone platform, claims that Dronecode's "Platinum members staged what can only be called a coup." According to Tridgell, the Platinum members "removed all top level open-source projects from Dronecode, leaving only their own nominees in the Technical Steering Committee. They passed a resolution requiring that all projects hand over control of all trademarks, accounts, and domains to their control." Dronecode's Platinum members are 3DR, Intel, and Qualcomm. Dronecode, which uses Linux as its base, is sponsored by The Linux Foundation. Dronecode's governance, however, is completely independent of the Foundation. This fork happened because of the Platinum's members' "overwhelming desire to be able to make a proprietary autopilot stack." They were able to do this, wrote Tridgell, because "the structure and bylaws of Dronecode are built around exceptional power for the Platinum members, giving them extraordinary control over the future of Dronecode. This is a fundamental flaw in a project meant to promote free and open-source software as it means that the business interests of a very small number of members can override the interests of the rest of the members and the community." The PX4 open-source autopilot project leadership has accepted this. But, Tridgell explained, "The ArduPilot project won't be doing this, as we firmly believe that community-directed development is the best way to create a long-term sustainable free-software autopilot stack ... We believe that giving the Platinum members that degree of control over the future of ArduPilot would be irresponsible. ArduPilot is a community project, and its future direction must be set by the community." Chris Anderson, the chair of the Dronecode board of directors, 3DR CEO, and former editor-in-chief of Wired, has a different take. In a letter to Dronecode members, Anderson wrote: "The main request we heard from the members (and prospective members) is the desire for Dronecode to have a 'distro', a full-stack code base with a regular release cadence and roadmap, so that the members can align their own products around it. One of the main confusions about Dronecode to date is that it has been a relatively loose alliance of related projects, but not a 'thing'. 'How can I download and use Dronecode?' is a common question, and one that we haven't had a good answer to due to the 'basket of projects' composition of the organization. Therefore, the leadership are restructuring Dronecode to create just that: a proper world-class distro, built for commercial use, with a regular release cadence and roadmap." Clearly there was disagreement about this. And some programmers and designers have decided to fork Dronecode. Anderson thinks "that is a good thing. The truth of the matter is that these things happen when there is a real misalignment about the technical direction of the project. The majority of participants in the ecosystem, not just current Dronecode members but also commercial adopters who would like to become Dronecode members in the future, want a simple-to-install-and-use Dronecode distribution based on PX4. Tridge, Philip, and Tom, who have done great work in ArduPilot/APM, disagreed. Thus the fork." More robotics Artificial skin improves home care robots Georgia Tech researchers have created an artificial skin that could give robots a better sense of touch. Read More Anderson disagrees that the core issue is software freedom. Instead it's about serving the interests of the majority of drone users, developers, and vendors. Further Anderson promises, "Dronecode is committed to provide a unified code base on a regular release cadence that will be easy to implement with clear API's that will support the development of a rich UAV ecosystem. The Dronecode distribution will be released on a regular 6 month cadence and implementors can be confident using it in a commercial product or a hobby project. As always, technical governance will be open, the technical steering committee will be charged with decisions about the code and everything will be under an open-source license." The PX4-based distro roadmap will be out within the next few weeks. Which will win out in the end? Only time, and the quality of each group's code, will tell.

That’s a bit of a head-scratcher, given that with the iPhone 6s, Apple had one model that worked across all U.S. carriers. Even though most consumers don’t change carriers during the life of the phone, why would Apple seemingly take a step backward in terms of flexibility and simplicity? The reason has everything to do with the way the company does business. Apple loves to have more than one supplier of any key component. And while it designs the iPhone’s A10 processor (and that chip’s predecessors), it has long relied on Qualcomm exclusively for the iPhone’s modem chip. Exclusivity gives a supplier more leverage, and Apple likes to bargain from a position of strength. So there has been talk for a while now that, with the iPhone 7, Apple was going to split the modem business between Qualcomm and Intel. But Intel’s latest modem chip doesn’t support the old CDMA standard still used by Sprint and Verizon. By creating a separate version for Sprint and Verizon, Apple is able to use Qualcomm exclusively on that model while using chips from both Intel and Qualcomm for the GSM model used by AT&T and T-Mobile as well as many carriers in other parts of the world. Sources familiar with the situation as well as outsiders agree that the modem diversification effort is the likely reason for the separate phone versions. Apple and Intel declined to comment on the matter, and a Qualcomm representative was not immediately available for comment. While having separate models is a win for both Intel and Apple’s effort to gain more power over its suppliers, it’s a modest loss for customers, who now have to make a technological commitment to a carrier even in a world where many are no longer signing long-term financial contracts. As noted above, though, it’s a flexibility that few consumers take advantage of. The vast majority of people who change carriers do so at the same time they get a new phone. There are often switcher deals that make it more financially attractive to do so, and it’s just the way most people think about their cellphone service. For those who really want maximum flexibility, Apple offers the Apple Upgrade Program through its stores. With that program, you finance your phone over two years, but have the option to upgrade phones and change carriers each year. recode_divider In this Storystream All about the iPhone 7 What the iPhone 7 reveals about Apple’s augmented-reality plans Apple created extra versions of the iPhone 7 in order to make room for an Intel chip Apple’s iPhone upgrade program: How to turn your 6s into a 7 View all 13 stories More From Recode DraftKings and FanDuel used to hate each other.
