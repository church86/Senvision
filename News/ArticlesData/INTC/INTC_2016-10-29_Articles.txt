Review The entry-level, 13-inch MacBook Pro doesn't have the buzz-worthy Touch Bar everyone is talking about, but that doesn't mean this isn't a formidable laptop. For $1,499, you get a brighter and more colorful screen than the previous 13-inch MacBook Pro, a bigger touchpad, louder speakers, and speedier performance, all wrapped up in a design that's thinner, lighter and smaller than its predecessor. The battery life is pretty awesome, too. article continued below If you wanted an adaptive, multi-touch screen above the keyboard that provides all sorts of nifty shortcuts, you'd have to fork over $1,799 for the Touch Bar model. Is the more affordable new MacBook Pro we reviewed worth it? Yes, but it isn't as fast as cheaper Windows laptops with Intel's newer 7th-generation processors, and Apple ditched some useful ports to achieve this svelte design. Editors' Note: After retesting the 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar multiple times, we've determined that the battery life is just under 10 hours and not 12 hours as originally reported. This is in line with Apple's claims. Design: Honey, I Shrunk the MacBook Pro The new MacBook Pro looks both classic and modern, but I wouldn't call it thrilling. The aluminum body is certainly compact, as it has 23 percent less volume and is 17 percent thinner than the last 13-inch Pro. There is remarkable precision at work here, including the tiny speaker perforations that flank the keyboard, which give the deck a striking symmetry. Then there's the perfectly carved lip, which makes opening the lid effortless. If I had to choose, I'd opt for the new Space Gray color over the Silver, as the former hue has a more sophisticated vibe. But I do wish Apple would be a little more daring with its use of materials; for example, I like the way Dell uses carbon fiber on the inside of the XPS 13 to achieve a soft-touch feel. This is one of the brightest displays around, registering 495 nits in our testing. Measuring 11.97 x 8.36 x 0.58 inches and weighing 3.02 pounds, the new 13-inch MacBook Pro is smaller in every dimension than the previous model, which weighed 3.42 pounds and measured 12.35 x 8.62 x 0.71 inches. Still, 13-inch Windows ultraportables weigh less and are just as thin or thinner, such as the 2.7-pound Dell XPS 13 (11.98 x 7.88 x 0.33-0.6 inches) and the 2.8-pound HP Spectre x360 (12.03 x 8.58 x 0.54 inches). The 13.9-inch Yoga 910 measures 12.72 x 8.84 x 0.56 inches and weighs 3.04 pounds. Ports: Too Minimalist I hope you like dongles. This 13-inch MacBook Pro sports two Thunderbolt 3 ports on the left and a headphone jack on the right. The good news is that the Thunderbolt 3 ports, which have a USB-C connector, enable power and data over a single connection. They offer blazing fast transfer speeds (up to 40 Gbps) and will let you connect two 4K monitors. You must charge the laptop using either one of the two ports, as Apple has retired its MagSafe connection. (If you wanted to spend $1,799 on the Touch Bar 13-inch MacBook Pro, you'd get 4 Thunderbolt 3 ports.) Unfortunately, Apple got rid of the SD card slot, which means you'll need to use a USB-C card reader or connect your camera directly to the laptop using a dongle. The similarly-thin HP Spectre x360 and Yoga 910 also ditch the SD card but manage to include one full-size USB port. The thicker XPS 13 includes two USB 3 ports, an SD Card reader and one Thunderbolt 3/USB-C port. MORE:Â Thunderbolt 3 Explained: Why You Need the World's Fastest Port Apple sells a $69 USB-C Digital AV Multiport adapter that includes connections for HDMI and a full-size USB port for connecting devices like the iPhone, cameras and other peripherals. You can also pick up a USB-C to USB adapter for $19, but there's also plenty of third-party options that are cheaper. The MacBook Pro isn't as speedy as Windows ultraportables with 7th-generation Intel processors. Display: Super Bright and Colorful Apple says that the 2560 x 1600-pixel Retina display on the 13-inch MacBook Pro is 67 percent brighter than before. We didn't see that much of a difference, but this is still one of the brightest panels around; it registered 495 nits in our testing, which is significantly higher than the 385 nits on the last model. By comparison, the Dell XPS 13 hit just 302 nits, the HP Spectre x360 317 nits and the Lenovo Yoga 910 292 nits. This display also offers rich colors, as evidenced when I downloaded a 4K photo of a sunrise shot through a wave. I saw vibrant blues, greens, yellows and oranges. When watching the Rogue One trailer, I could make out every scratch on a box a rebel was hiding behind, as well as the drops of sweat on his forehead. My only complaint when watching video is that I wish the black levels were higher. These are the best speakers I've heard on this size laptop. On our tests, this screen reproduced 113 percent of the sRGB color gamut (higher numbers are better) while turning in a Delta-E color accuracy score of 1.0 (closer to 0 is best). This makes the MacBook Pro's display more colorful but not quite as accurate as the XPS 13 (93.6 percent, 0.76 Delta-E), Spectre x360 (101, 0.74) and Yoga 910 (98, 0.76). Audio: Best in Class Whether you like to binge watch Netflix, rock out on Spotify or hear every detail in that movie you're scoring in Final Cut Pro, you'll love the improved stereo speakers on the 13-inch MacBook Pro. In fact, these are the best speakers I've heard on this size laptop. Apple redesigned the speakers to deliver twice the dynamic range and three times the peak power while minimizing distortion. When I played "Don't Wanna Know" by Maroon 5 and Kendrick Lamar at max volume, Adam Levine's soaring falsetto sounded crystal clear. On Twenty One Pilots' "Heathens," the bass line had plenty of bunch which never got lost amidst Tyler Joseph's vocals. Keyboard and Touchpad: A Better Butterfly Unless you've used the 12-inch MacBook's keyboard, like I have for the last couple years, you'll find the butterfly keyboard on the 13-inch Pro to be disarmingly flat at first. But while this second-generation layout technically has the same low amount of travel (0.5 mm) as that notebook, the new one offers better tactile feedback, thanks to an improved dome switch design. I typed this entire review on the 13-inch MacBook Pro, and found it to be plenty speedy and fairly comfortable. On the 10FastFingers typing test, I averaged between 65 and 70 words per minute with 5 to 6 errors. I did miss some keys at times, forcing me to correct small mistakes. The Force Touch trackpad continues to click without clicking like before, as there's a Taptic Engine that delivers precise haptic feedback. What's different is the size; this touchpad is positively huge at 5.3 x 3.3 inches, which is 46 percent larger than the last 13-inch Pro. And yet the trackpad never registered accidental swipes or clicks as I typed. My only advice is to disable the Force Click function in settings; I found myself inadvertently long pressing on words to look up their meanings when I only wanted to select text. Performance: Good, But 7th Gen Would Be Better While other Windows laptops are opting for Intel's latest and greatest 7th-generation Kaby Lake processor, Apple chose to stick with a 6th-generation Core i5 CPU on the 13-inch MacBook Pro running at 2-GHz. You also get 8GB of RAM, 256GB of flash storage and Intel Iris Graphics 540. The result is a notebook that's faster than the previous Pro but not as speedy as the competition. Even when I had more than a dozen tabs open in Chrome, along with Firefox, Safari and Pixelmator running in the background, the MacBook Pro never stuttered like the Core m-powered 12-inch MacBook that I typically use. On Geekbench 4, which measures overall performance, the 13-inch MacBook Pro scored 7,053. That's above the ultraportable category average of 6,618, but below the mark posted by the $1,099 Dell XPS 13 with a 7th-generation Core i5 processor (7,287). Powered by 7th-generation Core i7 chips, the $1,300 HP Spectre x360 (8,147) and $1,200 Lenovo Yoga 910 (8,102) also outpaced the MacBook Pro. The 13-inch MacBook Pro should have no problem crunching numbers, but again it fell behind 7th-gen Core-powered Windows notebooks. It took the Apple notebook 4 minutes and 39 seconds to match 20,000 names and addresses. That beats the 6:24 average but is more than 30 seconds slower than the XPS 13 and a good minute behind the Spectre x360 and Yoga 910. The new MacBook Pro does smoke the competition when it comes to its flash storage. It transfered about 5GB worth of files in just 10 seconds, which translates to 508.9 megabytes per second. Graphics: Iris is Pretty Solid Apple opted for Iris 540 graphics on the 13-inch MacBook Pro, which is backed by 64MB of eDRAM, which is supposed to accelerate both graphics and processor workloads. It delivered mixed results on our tests. You can certainly game on this notebook, as we saw during a playthrough of the Dirt 3 racing game. At full HD resolution at medium settings, the MacBook Pro notched an average of 35 frames per second, which is perfectly playable. That's higher than the Dell XPS 13's 28 fps at the same settings and the 25 fps category average. However, the Core i7-powered HP Spectre x360 (40 fps) and Yoga 910 (50 fps) both scored higher. On the Cinebench OpenGL graphics rendering test, which simulates a car chase scene, the MacBook Pro achieved a decent 35.69 fps, but both the Dell XPS 13 (42.62 fps) and Spectre x360 (43.8 fps) scored higher. Battery Life: Superb Endurance Apple rates the 54.5 watt-hour battery in the 13-inch MacBook Pro for 10 hours of web surfing time, and that's roughly what it gets in real life. On the Laptop Mag web surfing test, in which we set the screen at 100 nits of brightness and surf the web over Wi-Fi, the MacBook Pro lasted a strong 9 hours and 50 minutes. That beats the ultraportable laptop average of 7:58, but it's less than the 2015 MacBook Pro we reviewed (12:04), as well as the HP Spectre x360 (10:06), Yoga 910 (10:36) and Dell XPS 13. Heat: A Quiet Partner The 13-inch MacBook Pro runs cool in some spots and warm in others, but the fan kept things quiet during our testing. After streaming full-screen video for 15 minutes, the touchpad registered just 85 degrees, which is well below our 95-degree comfort threshold. However, both the keyboard and the bottom of the notebook reached 98 degrees. It was noticeable but not uncomfortable. Software: Siri inside, No bloat One of the benefits of opting for a Mac is that you don't have to worry about unwanted third-party software taking up storage space. It's really all about a pure macOS Sierra experience, which gives you Siri on the Mac for the first time. There's also an Optimized Storage feature that can help free up space when you need it, support for Apple Pay purchases online and an improved Photos app that automatically curates images into ready-made collections called Memories. Configuration Options The entry-level, 13-inch MacBook I reviewed starts at $1,499 and includes a 2-GHz 6th generation Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of memory and a 256GB PCI-e based SSD, plus Intel Iris graphics. Upgrading can get pretty pricey, as jumping up to a Core i7 CPU costs $300. Opting for 16GB of RAM will cost you $200, as will 512GB of flash storage. A 1TB SSD will run you $600. If you would prefer to check out Apple's innovative new Touch Bar, which puts a multitouch screen above the keyboard to give you a wide range of contextually relevant shortcut controls depending on the app you're using, you'll have to pay $1,799. You'll also get a Touch ID button for logging into your Mac and making Apple Pay purchases with a tap of your finger, as well two additional Thunderbolt 3 ports and a faster 2.9-GHz processor. Bottom Line The 13-inch MacBook Pro improves upon its predecessor in nearly every way. It's faster, lighter and more compact, and it offers a brighter display than most Windows machines. I also like the rich and powerful stereo speakers. However, while I'm glad Apple included 2 fast Thunderbolt 3 ports, I wish it kept a traditional USB 3.0 port around for charging the iPhone and connecting other peripherals, as well as an SD card slot. At $1,499, the MacBook Pro also has a higher starting price than most premium Windows ultraportables, and it's $200 more than its predecessor. I'm also not a fan of the decision to opt for an older 6th-generation Intel processor, which means you simply don't get as much performance as systems with 7th-gen CPUs, such as the Dell XPS 13, HP Spectre x360 and Yoga 910. The HP and Lenovo have the added benefit of being 2-in-1s with touchscreens you can use as tablets. So, yes, the new MacBook Pro is an excellent laptop, and I strongly recommend it. But I also wish Apple included the latest Intel processors for the price. Which MacBook Should You Buy?

Up in herrre. :/ Barry Says: November 6th, 2016 at 5:02 pm We ALL need ports and not having the right dongle when getting ready to make a presentation is a deal killer. Further, some have posted videos showing that a dongle can cause WiFi to stop working! This long awaited as in years, upgrade STILL has a max of 16GB memory.....how many years on this limit? a decade? I love thinner but a piece of paper is even thinner just does not do what I need. MBP Retina 13" still is going to be about 80% the performance and zero additional cost. No dongles required. (runs 3 displays! 4k Apple Thunderbolt and built in) Manuel Says: November 3rd, 2016 at 6:50 pm Thanks for your feedback, zeyad morsy. Typically I usually use it for research (i.e. sustained writing and browsing) rather than media-intensive work, so I figured it would be sufficient. My wife does some photo and video editing, though, and I don't see why in 3ish years when the 2012 MBP gives up the ghost, she shouldn't be able to use mine. Maybe I'll just pay extra for RAM and let that be that. zeyad morsy Says: November 2nd, 2016 at 4:52 pm No Manuel, I'm pretty sure that you won't be seeing any performance degradation. In fact, you'll be seeing a huge jump in performance. The new ssd is almost 4 times faster than the 2012 model and the GPU is extremely better. only thing that you'll notice will be the reduction in ram. I suggest upgrading the ram if you think that you'll need it, but if you will be using this laptop for browsing and writings. 8 gigs will be just fine, even more than you'll need for those basic tasks. Mark Spoonauer Says: November 2nd, 2016 at 1:01 pm Thanks for the comments. I do mention Cinebench graphics performance in the review and the MacBook Pro fell flat there as well. I'm open to using other cross-platform graphics benchmarks. But so far I'm not seeing evidence last-generation Iris is better. Seylan Says: November 1st, 2016 at 6:26 pm This should have been priced at $1200, while the touch-bar model should have been $1500. I was really looking forward to these new macbooks, but there's not a lot of value for money here. Henry 3 Dogg Says: November 1st, 2016 at 2:19 pm "I wish it kept a traditional USB 3.0 port around for charging the iPhone" Use a Lightening to USB C cable. David Hellmann Says: November 1st, 2016 at 2:16 pm I think about the new non touch version with 16GB or and used Air 13 2.2 / 8GB / 256GB. The new one without TB looks great but I'm not sure if its the best decision to buy this macbook now when in Q1 maybe an update is coming. I don't know but that feels not 100% right. Maybe if alle the prices are 200 $ cheaper it was more easy to decide. Hmmmmm. p_giguere1 Says: October 31st, 2016 at 7:02 pm I think this review isn't entirely fair. The author mentions several times that the fact it uses a last-generation Intel chip is a con. Yet Intel has not launched any Kaby Lake chip with Iris graphics yet. That's the reason Apple is sticking with Skylake. Basically, Apple had to choose between a significantly better GPU (Skylake with Iris 540) or slightly better CPU (Kaby Lake with HD 620), and they went with there former, which was more expensive and which IMO was the right choice. Yet the author doesn't mention this MBP has much better graphics than the other laptops he compared it to. In fact he claims the opposite. This comes from the fact he isn't measuring actual GPU performance, but rather the gaming performance in a specific game (Dirt 3). That game runs worse not because the GPU in the MBP is worse, but because Mac games are mostly quick ports (cider wraps) with much worse performance under OpenGL than the original Windows game under DirectX. The graphics portion of this review is therefore not really representative of graphics performance outside of gaming. It's also not considering that anybody with a Mac that wants good gaming performance will simply use Boot Camp. So yeah, I would personally not have put the fact it uses Skylake as a con, given that's the reason it has Iris graphics. If anything, it's a pro compared to those other laptops that use Kaby Lake chips with HD 620 graphics. Nathan Says: October 31st, 2016 at 9:58 am I understand that your review unit is the 2.0 GHz one, right? I was considering about buying either the last year's 2.7 GHz i5 or this model. This makes me quite sure that the 2.0 GHz model will do the trick for me. Manuel Says: October 31st, 2016 at 7:43 am Thanks for this in-depth review. I'm considering purchasing this entry-level MBP 2016, but I'm a bit spooked by the the lower 2-GHz i5 processor. Do I understand you correctly to be saying that the performance is nevertheless better than the 2015 MBP, which comes with a 2.7-GHz i5 (5th gen)? I'm attracted this latest update because of portability / screen / battery life, but it just feels weird to pay so much money to leave my mid-2012 (non-retina) 16GB ram / 512GB SSD for a laptop with 8GB ram and 256 SSD. Would I see a reduction in performance? John R Says: October 31st, 2016 at 4:32 am They've gone with Skylake because Kaby Lake isn't due to get Iris graphics until Q1 2017. That's why it's beaten the XPS in the graphics benchmarks. Trevor J Says: October 31st, 2016 at 12:45 am Do you think the battery life is greater than advertised because of the slightly bigger battery in the base model, the lower powered CPU, and the lack of the touchbar? James Pope Says: October 30th, 2016 at 6:06 pm I could care less about the processor being last gen. The newer PC's may have the latest processor but the build quality is crap. Ever single PC I have had dies after just a few years and the Mac's just keep on going. I would opt for a higher quality machine any day, and leave the latest processor (which most people don't need) behind every time.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 30, 2016 at 1:06PM On Oct. 27, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced three new MacBook Pro computers: a premium 15-inch model with an OLED Touch Bar, a premium 13-inch model with an OLED Touch Bar, and a 13-inch model without the OLED Touch Bar. Image source: Apple. The systems offer several nice improvements over the prior-generation 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros, ranging from improved displays and faster processors to sleeker industrial design. Apple has built a great set of machines here, and I suspect that the new models will do very well in the marketplace. Nevertheless, there is one fly in the proverbial ointment with these new machines that needs to be discussed. Soon-to-be last-generation processors Both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models use high-end Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) sixth-generation Core processors. The 13-inch MacBook Pro systems utilize dual-core Core i5 and Core i7 processors with Intel's premium Iris graphics, while the 15-inch models use quad-core Core i7 processors with lower-end vanilla Intel HD Graphics (though for graphics-intensive tasks, Apple has included more powerful stand-alone graphics chips in these systems). As of this writing, Apple's new MacBook Pros have some of the fastest notebook processors available on the planet. Unfortunately, though, these chips have been available for about a year now, and Intel will have more powerful notebook processors available in early 2017. Why did Apple choose older processors? The reality of the situation is that Apple launches its Mac systems -- particularly the MacBooks -- on its own schedule, rather than based on Intel's schedule. Apple likely wasn't ready to launch these new MacBook Pro systems when Intel's sixth-generation Core processors came out, so it simply had to wait until the system hardware and software were ready. Now, Apple could conceivably have waited until Intel released its new seventh-generation Core processors in January (pushing out the MacBook Pro launch by a couple of months), but the company probably didn't want to hold off on releasing these long-overdue updates to its MacBook Pro line any longer than it had to. Furthermore, the differences between the sixth-generation and seventh-generation Core processors don't amount to that much; the seventh-generation Core chips can run at higher speeds for a given power envelope, and they have slightly enhanced media playback capabilities. Nevertheless, since Apple's MacBook Pro systems are marketed as premium products, it's probably going to come as a disappointment to some that soon they will be using one-generation-old processor technologies. Can Apple's Mac get back up to speed? Apple could conceivably update the processors inside of the new MacBook Pro models to incorporate Intel's newer seventh-generation Core processors early next year. The new processors should be pin-compatible with the current sixth-generation Core processors (meaning that the chips can be placed into the same systems without hardware modification), so upgrading the systems from sixth-generation Core to seventh-generation Core wouldn't be too difficult. Even if Apple doesn't do this, there's a pretty simple way for Apple to get back on track -- skip the seventh-generation Core processors altogether. Intel's eighth-generation Core processors -- which should bring significant performance/feature gains over the seventh-generation Core chips -- should be available for notebooks during the second quarter of 2018, per a recent leak that's been circulating on the Web. Apple could just keep selling the recently released MacBook Pro systems until around May of 2018, at which point the company could release updated versions with Intel's new eighth-generation Core processors: problem solved.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 30, 2016 at 1:43PM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been telling investors for quite a while now that one of the business units that it's counting on for long-term growth is its Internet of Things, or IoT, segment. Although IoT is something of a catch-all term for a wide variety of applications, Intel's IoT business -- per a company presentation last year -- focuses on delivering platforms (that is, processors and other related components) into the areas shown in the following slide: Image source: Intel. Altogether, Intel pegged the served addressable market, or SAM, of these segments at $15 billion to $18 billionÂ -- clearly a sizable opportunity for the chipmaker. Given the long-term revenue potential of this market, it's important for investors to keep an eye on how Intel's IoT business performs, and in the company's most recent quarter, it performed quite well. Double-digit growth for the IoT business in Q3 During the third quarter, the IoT business generated $689 million of revenue, up 18.6% year-over-year. Profitability also improved during that period as operating income jumped from $150 million to $191 million, more than 27% growth. That revenue figure, per Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, represented an "all-time revenue record" for this business unit. The executive cited "strength across the board in retail, video, and transportation segments" for the strong result. Year-to-date, the IoT business has brought in $1.912 billion in revenue for Intel, representing about 14.3% growth over the year-ago period. Operating profit, on the other hand, is up just 5.4%, potentially reflecting the fact that the company has ratcheted up its investments in new products and technologies for this business. Intel is investing more in the IoT Intel Executive VP and former CFO Stacy Smith pointed out on the earnings call that Intel's restructuring program announced earlier this year is allowing the company to make "incremental investments in critical areas like the data center, Internet of Things, and memory." So far, the company has done a good job of capturing a significant portion of the SAM available to it in this market. If we assume that Intel's IoT business closes out the year delivering around 14% revenue growth (approximately $2.62 billion total), then the company will have captured anywhere from 14.5% to 17.5% of its served addressable market. That's a solid market share, but Intel is likely betting that with a more compelling, targeted set of products for the clients that it serves, it will be able grow its share of the overall market. Those "incremental investments" that Smith talked about are likely aimed at allowing Intel to do just that. Intel's automotive-specific chip, known as the Atom A3900. Image source: Intel. In fact, we are beginning to see the first fruits of Intel's increased investments in the Internet of Things. Just this week, AnandTech posted some information about a recently launched set of processors from Intel aimed specifically at IoT applications. Indeed, while Intel has been selling IoT-specific products into these applications, they have usually been based on the same exact silicon as chips used in other segments (PCs, tablets, and so on). In the case of the new Atom E3900 and A3900 chips, Intel has reportedly designed specialized system-on-chip products that incorporate much of the fundamental technologies used in other products (CPU cores, graphics) as well as IoT-specific technologies (you can read more about them on AnandTech). Time will tell if these investments in IoT-specific chips will pay off, but the odds -- especially considering the success that Intel has enjoyed in this market thus far -- look good.

Is the chipmaking giant about to stomp on Ambarellaâs toes? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 30, 2016 at 12:00PM Last month, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) purchased computer vision start-upÂ Movidius in a bid to beef up its RealSense depth-sensing cameras with AI capabilities. In late October, Movidius inked a major deal with Hikvision, the world's biggest surveillance company, to install its low-power Myriad 2 VPUsÂ (visual processing units) into its security cameras. A Myriad 2 reference board (L) and a Hikvision camera (R). Image source: Company websites. The new chips will help Hikvision's new cameras analyze activity in real-time using artificial intelligence. Hikvision CEO Hu Yangzhong declared that there were huge "gains to be made when it comes to neural networks and intelligent camera systems." He also noted that "embedded, native intelligence is a major step toward smart, safe, and efficiently run cities." Hikvision controls about 30% of the global market for security cameras. It's alsoÂ one of chipmaker Ambarella's (NASDAQ:AMBA) biggest customers. So as Intel and Movidius seal a major deal with Hikvision, should Ambarella investors worry about the company eventually losing a top customer? What computer vision means to Intel Over the past few years, Intel's primary goal has been to diversify away from its slow-growth PC and data center businesses with new investments in Internet of Things (IoT) modules, non-volatile memory, and new technologies like depth-sensing cameras with built-in artificial intelligence. In the drone market, Intel partnered withÂ AT&T (NYSE:T) to test automated drone flights across AT&T's LTE network, and combined its Atom chips with RealSense cameras to create a reference design for drone makers. In the VR and AR markets, Intel introduced Project Alloy, a "mixed reality" headset which is powered byÂ Intel's sixth generation Core processor and RealSense depth-sensing cameras. The device, which is similar to Microsoft's HoloLens, projects computer images on top of real-life objects. Intel's Project Alloy. Image source: Intel. In the connected car market, Intel acquiredÂ smaller companies like the computer vision start-up Itseez and Yogitech, a company that ensures that the chips powering driverless vehicles are operating properly. It also partnered with BMW and Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) toÂ develop new technologies for self-driving cars. Therefore, Intel's expansion into the security camera market is another adjacent move which complements those other efforts. How could this hurt Ambarella? Movidius and Ambarella aren't really direct competitors. Movidius generally produces lower-powered VPUs for IoT devices, whileÂ Ambarella produces higher-powered image processing chips that process high-detail images. Therefore, the two chips generally work in tandem in manyÂ devices, like DJI's Phantom 4 drone. Ambarella's chips process the images and video captured by the sensor, but Movidius' VPUs allow the Phantom 4 to fly autonomously and avoid obstacles. The chips also work together in security cameras -- Ambarella's SoCs process the details, while Movidius' VPUs analyze the movements. But looking ahead, Intel would likely benefit from producing "all-in-one" reference designs that use its Core CPUs for image processing, its RealSense cameras for "seeing", and its Movidius VPUs for analyzing the viewed objects. That bundle could lock Ambarella out of the lucrative computer vision market. Ambarella is clearly aware of that threat -- that's why it acquired the computer vision firm VisLab last year for $30 million. It also plansÂ to launch a dedicated computer vision chip by the end of this year. If Ambarella plays its cards right, it can leverage its reputation as the "best in breed" manufacturer of image processing SoCs to secure its spot in the budding computer vision market. But if it waits too long, major customers like Hikvision and DJI could be lured away by Intel's all-in-one solutions. The key takeaways Movidius and Ambarella's technologies currently complement each other, but this could change next year as Intel expands more aggressively into the computer vision market. Another major threat is Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), which has been aggressively courting major Ambarella customers like DJI and GoProÂ with its Snapdragon-powered computer vision platforms.Â  The next few years could be tough for Ambarella as it tries to hold those larger rivals at bay with new image processing and computer vision chipsets. But they could also be fruitful if Ambarella maintains its lead as the "best in breed" chipmaker in image processing and computer vision solutions. Â  Leo Sun owns shares of AT&T and Qualcomm.

Following her visit, Dunn brought further awareness to the Intel She Will Connect app at a hands-on-session where leading NGO and media personnel could learn ways to adopt the tool to reach more girls, especially in rural areas, to educate them on digital literacy. Marne Dunn is known for her strong passion to close the gender digital divide, and she continues to inspire people to lifelong learning. She currently leads the Intel She Will Connect Program which is a Corporate Affairs initiative of Intel aimed at closing the gender digital divide and enabling women through technology. With a goal to lead her team over the next 3 years to reach 5 Million women and to create lasting change in communities by enabling 10,000 women by the end of 2020, Marne and her team will leverage the Intel She Will Connect App. As part of this drive, Marneâs recent visit to Lagos, Nigeria was dedicated to the IntelÂ® She Will Connect app which is a highly useful tool that connects more women and girls with the internet. These participants learn to use mobile devices and PCs to empower themselves, while remaining safe. Girls can learn to use technology to access the Internet, set up email accounts, research health and wellness topics, practice Internet safety on social media platforms like Facebook, while also getting inspirational stories of women who have benefited greatly by connecting to the internet. Using the Intel She Will Connect App The She Will Connect App is a simple easy to use app that comes with four categories: Inspire, Learn, Connect and Explore. Inspire: To help users to understand why they should use the internet, and also share inspiring stories of women using the internet. Learn: To help users learn how to computer and mobile device basics, as well as using a keyboard, using touch features, connecting to Wi-Fi, understanding Data Usage and Cost, protecting your devices. Connect: To help users learn how to create an account, send email, use Social Media, like creating a facebook account, sharing information, and downloading content, like Mobile Apps. Explore: It opens users to the endless possibility available on the internet. The device helps users to learn to explore the internet for information like learning how to start a business, Finding access to education, health and info, as well as reading local and global news, and also read about the inspiring lives of many women on My Digital Journey. Challenges of bridging the technological divide in Nigeria. A report from the ITU World Telecommunication/ICT indicator database states that globally, there are more men than women using the internet. We have 37% of women online compared to 41% of men across the globe. This means 1.3billion women and 1.5billion men. In the developing world, which includes Nigeria, this means about 826million female internet users and 483 million male internet users. In essence, the gender divide is more prominent in the developing countries, where 16% less women than men use the internet. While there are several challenges that women and girls face in bridging the gender gaps in technology, most prevalent ones include education, infrastructure, skills, financial resources, and power and decision making. The internet can open up opportunities and close some of these gapsâthere are increasing online courses on the internet for women who want to educate themselves to acquire new skills, learn how to start a business, access funding organisations or even learn the basics of decision making in business. With a population of 162.5 million people in Nigeria, with 49% female, access and control of the technology in relations to opportunities is a challenge. Benefits of the apps The number of women without access to internet access is slowly being bridged by efforts like the Intel She Will Connect App. Currently, the IntelÂ® She Will Connect Program has successfully connected over 40,000 females to the internet, and the Awareness app will open even more possibility for more girls to become digitally literate The app will offer women and girls the opportunity to be empowered, enjoy access to health and educational information, and benefit from capacity building. With the app, more women and girls can enhance their social and economic knowledge, and in the long run this would empower, increase productivity and in the long run reduce poverty.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 30, 2016 at 11:42AM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has bet its future on its data-center group, or DCG. In 2016, this business unit is expected to rake in around $17 billion in revenue and a little under half that in operating income. Though not quite as large as the company's Client Computing Group, or CCG, in terms of either revenue or profit, it -- unlike CCG -- is exposed to a number of growing markets rather than mostly declining ones.Â  Intel Xeon E5 v2 processors. Image source: Intel. Â  This makes DCG Intel's best hope at being able to deliver consistent revenue growth. And that's why investors get a bit freaked out when this segment fails to deliver the kind of growth the both management and investors expect -- if the DCG party slows, Intel's longer-term prospects begin to look much dimmer.Â  Crucial to keeping the growth story going, particularly over the next couple of years, will be Intel's ability to build products compelling enough to keep the many chip companies looking to eat into its near-total dominance of the server processor market. That's why it was interesting to hear that Intel's next-generation server processor platform, known as Purley -- and referred to in leaked Intel slides as a platform that "changes the game" -- has begun sampling to major customers. What is Intel Purley? Purley is Intel's next-generation server processor platform, succeeding the company's prior-generation Grantley platform. The new platform is expected to deliver a bevy of new features, including enhanced connectivity, the ability for the processors to transfer data to and from memory at a much faster rate, and other features. More importantly, though, new platforms bring support for new processors. Under Intel's current product-development methodology, the introduction of a new platform also means the release of processors based on an all-new architecture, or design, relative to the prior-generation platform. These platforms do need to last anywhere from two to three years, depending on Intel's ability to roll out new platforms and associated processors, so Intel will usually release a follow-on set of processors that work with the same platform. The second-generation of processors on an Intel platform generally use mildly enhanced versions of the all-new processor architecture that comes with the introduction of the platform. The good news, though, is that this second wave of products is manufactured on newer manufacturing technologies that allow the company to cram many more processor cores into a given power envelope, thereby delivering significantly enhanced performance. What does Purley mean for investors? If Intel is sampling Purley to customers now, then the platform should begin volume shipments during the first half of 2017, if all goes as planned. Interestingly, CEO Brian Krzanich indicated on the company's most recent earnings call that Intel isn't seeing evidence that major customers are holding off buying today's Grantley platform to wait for Purley and Skylake-EP. If Krzanich is right about that, then investors may not want to bet on seeing Purley catalyze additional growth. Instead, the success of the Purley platform in that case will largely depend on the health of the data-center markets that Intel serves, as well as its ability to use Purley to defend against competitors. Nevertheless, Krzanich did talk about some of the non-CPU technologies that Intel will offer alongside Purley that it doesn't include with its Grantley platform today: "[Customers are] seeing not only just an overall [total cost of ownership] performance advantage that we see with each one of these [new server processor launches], but this also continues [Intel's] integration of things like the omni-path fabric; it has more integration of the silicon photonics, so it's still the adjacency functions that are quite strong; and they will get more and better as we go through each one of these. There will be a second generation of Purley that includes 3D XPoint." In other words, in addition to aiming to deliver the right performance and power efficiency to help fend off competitors, Intel is betting on Purley to be the way it encourages customers to buy more "non-CPU" products such as omni-path fabric, silicon photonics, and 3D XPoint memory modules. At its investor meeting in late 2015, Intel said the total addressable markets for these three technologies would be $1.6 billion, $5 billion, and $34 billion by 2020, respectively. Although Intel's data-center group revenues will ultimately live and die by the end demand for its server platforms, capturing share in these adjacent market opportunities would certainly be welcome revenue to the company and its investors.

What computer vision means to Intel Over the past few years, Intel's primary goal has been to diversify away from its slow-growth PC and data center businesses with new investments in Internet of Things (IoT) modules, non-volatile memory, and new technologies like depth-sensing cameras with built-in artificial intelligence. In the drone market, Intel partnered withÂ AT&T (NYSE:T) to test automated drone flights across AT&T's LTE network, and combined its Atom chips with RealSense cameras to create a reference design for drone makers. In the VR and AR markets, Intel introduced Project Alloy, a "mixed reality" headset which is powered byÂ Intel's sixth generation Core processor and RealSense depth-sensing cameras. The device, which is similar to Microsoft's HoloLens, projects computer images on top of real-life objects. Intel's Project Alloy. Image source: Intel. In the connected car market, Intel acquiredÂ smaller companies like the computer vision start-up Itseez and Yogitech, a company that ensures that the chips powering driverless vehicles are operating properly. It also partnered with BMW and Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) toÂ develop new technologies for self-driving cars. Therefore, Intel's expansion into the security camera market is another adjacent move which complements those other efforts. How could this hurt Ambarella? Movidius and Ambarella aren't really direct competitors. Movidius generally produces lower-powered VPUs for IoT devices, whileÂ Ambarella produces higher-powered image processing chips that process high-detail images. Therefore, the two chips generally work in tandem in manyÂ devices, like DJI's Phantom 4 drone. Ambarella's chips process the images and video captured by the sensor, but Movidius' VPUs allow the Phantom 4 to fly autonomously and avoid obstacles. The chips also work together in security cameras -- Ambarella's SoCs process the details, while Movidius' VPUs analyze the movements. But looking ahead, Intel would likely benefit from producing "all-in-one" reference designs that use its Core CPUs for image processing, its RealSense cameras for "seeing", and its Movidius VPUs for analyzing the viewed objects. That bundle could lock Ambarella out of the lucrative computer vision market. Ambarella is clearly aware of that threat -- that's why it acquired the computer vision firm VisLab last year for $30 million. It also plansÂ to launch a dedicated computer vision chip by the end of this year. If Ambarella plays its cards right, it can leverage its reputation as the "best in breed" manufacturer of image processing SoCs to secure its spot in the budding computer vision market. But if it waits too long, major customers like Hikvision and DJI could be lured away by Intel's all-in-one solutions. The key takeaways Movidius and Ambarella's technologies currently complement each other, but this could change next year as Intel expands more aggressively into the computer vision market. Another major threat is Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), which has been aggressively courting major Ambarella customers like DJI and GoProÂ with its Snapdragon-powered computer vision platforms.Â  The next few years could be tough for Ambarella as it tries to hold those larger rivals at bay with new image processing and computer vision chipsets. But they could also be fruitful if Ambarella maintains its lead as the "best in breed" chipmaker in image processing and computer vision solutions. Â  Leo Sun owns shares of AT&T and Qualcomm.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 30, 2016 at 11:42AM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has bet its future on its data-center group, or DCG. In 2016, this business unit is expected to rake in around $17 billion in revenue and a little under half that in operating income. Though not quite as large as the company's Client Computing Group, or CCG, in terms of either revenue or profit, it -- unlike CCG -- is exposed to a number of growing markets rather than mostly declining ones.Â  Intel Xeon E5 v2 processors. Image source: Intel. Â  This makes DCG Intel's best hope at being able to deliver consistent revenue growth. And that's why investors get a bit freaked out when this segment fails to deliver the kind of growth the both management and investors expect -- if the DCG party slows, Intel's longer-term prospects begin to look much dimmer.Â  Crucial to keeping the growth story going, particularly over the next couple of years, will be Intel's ability to build products compelling enough to keep the many chip companies looking to eat into its near-total dominance of the server processor market. That's why it was interesting to hear that Intel's next-generation server processor platform, known as Purley -- and referred to in leaked Intel slides as a platform that "changes the game" -- has begun sampling to major customers. What is Intel Purley? Purley is Intel's next-generation server processor platform, succeeding the company's prior-generation Grantley platform. The new platform is expected to deliver a bevy of new features, including enhanced connectivity, the ability for the processors to transfer data to and from memory at a much faster rate, and other features. More importantly, though, new platforms bring support for new processors. Under Intel's current product-development methodology, the introduction of a new platform also means the release of processors based on an all-new architecture, or design, relative to the prior-generation platform. These platforms do need to last anywhere from two to three years, depending on Intel's ability to roll out new platforms and associated processors, so Intel will usually release a follow-on set of processors that work with the same platform. The second-generation of processors on an Intel platform generally use mildly enhanced versions of the all-new processor architecture that comes with the introduction of the platform. The good news, though, is that this second wave of products is manufactured on newer manufacturing technologies that allow the company to cram many more processor cores into a given power envelope, thereby delivering significantly enhanced performance. What does Purley mean for investors? If Intel is sampling Purley to customers now, then the platform should begin volume shipments during the first half of 2017, if all goes as planned. Interestingly, CEO Brian Krzanich indicated on the company's most recent earnings call that Intel isn't seeing evidence that major customers are holding off buying today's Grantley platform to wait for Purley and Skylake-EP. If Krzanich is right about that, then investors may not want to bet on seeing Purley catalyze additional growth. Instead, the success of the Purley platform in that case will largely depend on the health of the data-center markets that Intel serves, as well as its ability to use Purley to defend against competitors. Nevertheless, Krzanich did talk about some of the non-CPU technologies that Intel will offer alongside Purley that it doesn't include with its Grantley platform today: "[Customers are] seeing not only just an overall [total cost of ownership] performance advantage that we see with each one of these [new server processor launches], but this also continues [Intel's] integration of things like the omni-path fabric; it has more integration of the silicon photonics, so it's still the adjacency functions that are quite strong; and they will get more and better as we go through each one of these. There will be a second generation of Purley that includes 3D XPoint." In other words, in addition to aiming to deliver the right performance and power efficiency to help fend off competitors, Intel is betting on Purley to be the way it encourages customers to buy more "non-CPU" products such as omni-path fabric, silicon photonics, and 3D XPoint memory modules. At its investor meeting in late 2015, Intel said the total addressable markets for these three technologies would be $1.6 billion, $5 billion, and $34 billion by 2020, respectively. Although Intel's data-center group revenues will ultimately live and die by the end demand for its server platforms, capturing share in these adjacent market opportunities would certainly be welcome revenue to the company and its investors.

But is the added price worth the upgrade?Â  ( Apple ) Advertisement Apple recently unveiled new MacBook Pro modelsÂ after a long time of not giving enough attention to the MacBook Pro. One of the biggest features in the new 13-inch and 15-inch models is Apple's Touch Bar, a secondary OLED multi-touch panel that changes interfaces depending on the app currently used. Also on board the new MacBook are sixth-generation Skylake processors and Touch ID. Apart from the aforementioned features, there's not much to say about the new MacBook Pro models, aside from having extra power and losing some of the ports from before. This begs the question, is it really worth the upgrade? What's New? The base 13-inch model MacBook Pro doesn't come with the Touch Bar or the Touch ID, but it does come with a 2.0 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor and an SSD with 256 GB. It has 8 GB of RAM that can be configured to 16 GB, and it sports an Intel Iris Graphics 540 GPU. Another 13-inch model with the Touch Bar is available for an extra cost, which comes with a more powerful 2.9 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor and an Intel Iris Graphics 550 GPU. The 15-inch model comes with the Touch Bar as a standard feature, and the most expensive model has a 2.7 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, an SSD with 512 GB, integrated Intel HD Graphics 530 and a beefed-up Radeon Pro 455 for its GPU with 2 GB of GDDR5 memory and automatic graphics switching. The new butterfly-style keyboard and Force Touch trackpad are also present in the new MacBook Pro models. Beyond that, the changes aren't huge. It's the same Retina display that came with the MacBook Pro in 2015, only 67 percent brighter. Aside from slight cosmetic changes and a considerably thinner chassis, the new MacBook Pro models don more powerful processors, with the higher end 13-inch and the 15-inch model coming with Touch Bar and Touch ID. Overall, it's not a colossal departure from last year's models. Are The New Features Worth The Added Cost? Despite the sizable possibilities with the new Touch Bar, it's safe to say that there was never a demand for the feature in the first place. In fact, what users actually wanted more from an Apple laptop was a touchscreen. There's no telling what developers can come up withÂ Touch Bar, but for something largely unexplored, the Touch Bar seems like a nice add-on instead of a compelling selling point. Consumers aren't likely ready to break bank on the newer models just for the Touch Bar alone. If anything, maybe they'd put more consideration into the sixth-generation processors on these models as a defining factor. For now, the Touch Bar and Touch ID are nice bonuses for the more powerful MacBook Pro models, but it's an exaggeration to call it something revolutionary since the MacBooks are perfectly functional even without them. Should You Upgrade? One of the best deciding factors to arrive at a conclusion is to ask yourself what exactly will you use the MacBook for. Will you use it as an all-around laptop that can do basic functions such as web browsing, word processing, intermediate photo or video editing? Or are you intending to use graphics-intensive software as part of your profession? Apple is targeting filmmakers, editors, designers and creative professionals in trying to sell the Touch Bar as a necessary innovation in the way we interact with software. So if you're not part of that demographic, it's highly unlikely that you'll find the Touch Bar a compelling feature to have to justify the added cost. If you're itching for a MacBook Pro but you aren't that enthusiastic about the added bells and whistles of the newer models, then last year's MacBook would serve you just fine. In fact, those who are planning to get the new MacBook pro models are in for some hefty dongle purchases since they only come with two to four USB-C ports compared with last year's model that carried an HDMI port, two Thunderbolt 2 ports, an SD card reader and two USB 3.0 ports. In conclusion, if you're willing to shell out the added cost and upgrade, then do as you please. But if you're a bit skeptical, it's probably best to trust your gut. A comprehensive comparisonÂ of last year's MacBook Pro models should equip you sufficiently and let you know exactly what you're getting if your eyes are set on the older MacBook Pro. The MacBook Pro 2015 model starts at $1,299, while the newer base model sans the Touch Bar starts at $1,499. The 15-inch MacBook Pro 2015 model costs $1,999, while the newer 15-inch model costs $2,399. You can compare different models directly at Apple's website.

At the time there was a strong assumption that this would be mobile focused â perhaps in the form of a cellular modem or an ARM core â and it turns out the assumptions were both right and wrong. Today AMD is announcing that they are in fact going to start integrating ARM cores into future APUs starting in 2013, but not in the way youâre probably thinking. If you look at AMDâs long term strategy, not only do they need to continue to compete with Intel on the technology front, but they also want to better position themselves to compete on the tablet front. AMD has the basic hardware for this with their APU families, particularly for tablets with their Zacate based entry-level APUs, but they have a feature gap in certain markets. Both Intel and ARM have hardware trusted platform/security technologies but AMD lacks such a technology. For various reasons weâll get to in a moment, AMD believes they need some kind of hardware security platform technology to continue to compete in the market in the future. Intelâs Trusted Execution Technology is not part of the x86 specification and is therefore not shared, so AMD would need to come up with their own technology. Designing and implementing such a technology is not only resource intensive but by its very nature it fragments the market, which is something AMD doesnât necessarily have the clout to get away with all the time. So rather than design their own technology theyâve chosen to license an existing technology, and this brings us to ARM. In order to implement a hardware security platform on their future APUs, AMD has chosen to enter into a strategic partnership with ARM for the purpose of gaining access to ARMâs TrustZone technology. By licensing TrustZone, AMD gains a hardware security platform thatâs already in active use, which means they avoid fragmenting the market and the risks that would bring. Furthermore AMD saves on the years of work â both technical and evangelical â that they would have needed had they rolled their own solution. Or more simply put, given their new willingness to integrate 3rd party IP, licensing was the easy solution to getting a hardware security platform quickly. But because TrustZone is an ARM technology (both in name and ISA) AMD needs an ARM CPU to execute it. So the key to all of this will be the integration of an ARM processor into an AMD APU, specifically ARMâs Cortex-A5 CPU. The Cortex-A5 is ARMâs simplest ARMv7 application processor, and while itâs primarily designed for entry-level and other lower-performance devices, as it turns out it fits AMDâs needs quite nicely since it wonât be used as a primary application processor. ARM TrustZone Hardware Model; Normal World Would Be On x86 This also means that the ARM and x86 CPU cores will fit together in an interesting manner unlike any existing ARM or Intel x86 CPU. By integrating a low-power/low-performance ARM CPU in this manner an application will be split up over multiple CPUs, with the TrustZone secure backend executing on the Cortex-A5 while the frontend logic will be executing as normal on AMDâs x86 CPU and GPU cores. This gives AMD a dedicated security co-processor with all the benefits and drawbacks thereof, while on full ARM processors and on Intelâs x86 processors TrustZone and TXT respectively are hardware features of a single CPU. By implementing a hardware security platform in this manner AMD not only gains a relatively quick turnaround time on the hardware, but on the software side too. AMD is specifically looking to leverage existing ARM applications for their tablet ambitions by taking advantage of the fact that existing TrustZone application cores can easily (if not directly) be ported over to AMDâs APUs. Developers would still need to put in some effort to write the necessary x86 frontends (in all likelihood written in scratch for Win8 as opposed to any kind of Android), but the hard part of implementing and validating the TrustZone functionality would simply carry over, leaving the new x86 frontend to talk to the existing ARM TrustZone application core. AMD isnât in any position to talk about specific software yet, but weâre told that theyâve been working with select software partners even before this announcement in order to get a jump on developing applications. As for the hardware details AMD hasnât named any specific APUs that will be receiving the Cortex-A5, but they have told us that they intend to start with the low-power APUs in order to go after the tablet market. That means weâre almost certainly looking at the 2013 successor to the Zacate APU found at the heart of AMDâs Brazos platform. However AMD wonât be stopping there, and in 2014 and beyond AMD will continue to add it to further APUs until AMDâs entire APU lineup from mobile to desktop to server contains the Cortex-A5 and TrustZone functionality. Having covered the technology, letâs also quickly discuss why AMD is pursuing this move. As AMD is pitching this itâs not just closing a feature gap but also about what it enables. A big focus of this of course is on trusted computing in the classical sense, meaning DRM for consumer applications and on platform lockdown and auditing for business IT purposes. But as weâve seen Intel do with their acquisition of McAfee some years back, thereâs also a strong focus on securing systems from malware in the form of new anti-virus technologies and in newer applications such as mobile payments. Even cloud services get a mention in here, since TrustZone can be used to make sure malware isnât watching in on a session from the client. Itâs worth noting that AMD also has a bit of self-interest in here. AMDâs Chief Information Officer Mike Wolfe is spearheading this announcement with a focus on how AMD intends to use this technology internally. AMD recently implemented a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy for employees to let them use their own computers at work. BYOD is popular with employees because it allows them to use the device they like the most, but itâs a potential headache for IT since it means many different devices that need to be supported and secured. As a result only a select number of generally high-end devices are allowed in AMDâs BYOD environment because most low-end x86 devices lack hardware security platform technology. By implementing this in their entire range of APUs, AMD expects to be self-serving here by expanding the range of devices they can support. At the same time AMD and Wolfe expect other companies to adopt BYOD too, in which case this will help to quickly set up AMD to serve a potentially large market. Wrapping things up, we would be remiss to ignore the elephant in the room, which of course is the inclusion of an ARM core in the first place. A lot of speculation has been going on that AMD is considering adopting the ARM architecture on a broader basis â particularly if HSA takes off and makes the underlying architecture less important â and this certainly is going to fuel more of that. The Cortex-A5 in AMDâs future APUs will be a fully functional ARM processor and in theory it is possible to run full ARM applications on the processor (OS differences not withstanding), though at this point in time AMD hasnât released the full details on how accessing the ARM processor will work. Even if AMD just intends to use ARM for TrustZone today, this opens the door to comprehensive native ARM code execution in the future if AMD wanted to go that way; but at the same time this could end up being as far as AMD ever goes. In any case we arenât expecting AMD to go into any more detail about this announcement here at AFDS, but there are still two days of keynotes to go. Otherwise weâd expect AMD to discuss this in greater detail once theyâre ready to unveil more details about their 2013 APUs. So until then stay tuned.

Reply Yuriman - Wednesday, June 13, 2012 - link Taken from arm.com: "TrustZone technology, tightly integrated tightly into Cortexâ¢-A processors, extends throughout the system via the AMBAÂ® AXIâ¢ bus and specific TrustZone System IP blocks. This system approach means that it is possible to secure peripherals such as secure memory, crypto blocks, keyboard and screen to ensure they can be protected from software attack." In part, AMD is embarrassed that their employees can only bring Intel processors onto their secure work network due to lack of hardware security on AMD's own chips. Hardware level security is the future. Reply ExarKun333 - Wednesday, June 13, 2012 - link LOL, yeah they should be a little embarrassed that their own workers cannot bring AMD CPUs into work. :) Reply JKflipflop98 - Wednesday, June 13, 2012 - link That's funny because Intel still uses Pentium 4's and 1st gen Core 2's internally.

Netflix requires such locks to appease the MPAA. Reply taltamir - Wednesday, June 13, 2012 - link Trusted computing is the holy grail of DRM. The name comes from a CIA in joke, you can only trust a system you compromised and whose user has less control then you do. It includes hardware chips that verify the hash of software before it is allowed to run. Making it impossible to get a virus. It also makes it impossible to run open source software and it allows remote censorship. They can decide for example that a certain document needs to go, they send a kill signal and any trusted computing computer out there deletes all copies of said document without the user consent. Reply taltamir - Wednesday, June 13, 2012 - link It should be noted that to leverage it in such a manner it needs to be standard everywhere. The hardware makers already put it everywhere. But the problem is laws, which is why there are ongoing attempts to make it legally required (just like for a time HDCP was mandated by law). So far they have failed to do so in the USA. And have yet to mandate big brother. Reply Jaybus - Thursday, June 14, 2012 - link It is really quite annoying and downright frightening. An implementation for consumer protection is one thing. For example, modern cars have an electronic ignition key that prevents thieves from making a plain mechanical key and driving off with it. But the key and car, once paired, make a standalone system. Ford can't remotely revoke the key if they decide that you are not driving the car in compliance with an "end user license". Sound crazy? Well, the car and key combination is a form of TPM. It is certainly possible from a technology standpoint for the car to phone home and validate the key. This whole DRM / TPM thing is subverting the very concept of ownership. What does it mean these days to own something? Do you really own something if someone else can control whether or not you may use it? If this is the future, then the future is not unlike the "company store" concept from the 19th century.

One of these stocks is an industry juggernaut, the other is an opportunistic bet on a cyclical upturn. One of them could work in your portfolio -- maybe even both. Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) Oct 29, 2016 at 10:45AM Image source: Getty Images. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) have a lot in common, and a long history of working together. Personally, I own both stocks. But if you had to choose one of these chip stocks to buy today, which one would it be? Let's have a look. By the numbers Let's get this out of the way right at the beginning. Intel is a far larger and more diverse business than Micron. This shows in many ways, including the stock charts. If you are a growth-thirsty thrill seeker, one look at this chart will tell you that Micron is right up your alley in ways that Intel just isn't. On the other hand, risk-averse value hunters will reach exactly the opposite conclusion: MU Total Return Price data by YCharts And if that wasn't obvious enough, these fundamental financial differences between Micron and Intel just might tip your scales: Financial Metric Intel Micron Revenue (TTM) $57.9 billion $12.4 billion Net Income (TTM) $10.4 billion $(276) million EBITDA Profit (TTM) $22.3 billion $3.3 billion Total Cash $17.8 billion $4.4 billion Total Debt $27.6 billion $9.9 billion Credit Rating A1 (medium investment-grade) Ba3 (non-investment grade, speculative) Data from Yahoo! Finance. TTM = trailing twelve months. It really doesn't matter how you slice it. Intel always comes out as the more stable and reliable choice in this contest. The company's credit rating is comparable to that of major banks, and better than those of some European countries. But a bank or a country with Micron's risky credit rating is standing with one leg in all-out bankruptcy already. Micron is neither a bank nor a country, though -- plenty of respectable businesses get by just fine with speculative-grade credit ratings. But interest rates will be higher when they take out loans, and these ratings are a good indication of business risk. In a nutshell, Intel is a low-risk investment, while Micron investors must accept a higher level of financial risk. The case for Micron If all signs point in favor of Intel, why would anybody want to own Micron instead? Micron's chosen trade is extremely cyclical. Sure, Intel's order volume moves up and down with the economy, with the short-term popularity of PC systems, with the global need for big-iron enterprise servers, and many other factors. But none of these market-moving factors can hold a candle to the drastic ups and downs of the computer memory market. In short, Micron is subject to all of the same product demand drivers that affect Intel -- plus regularly occurring price wars that have nothing to do with end-user demand. When memory market leaders Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), Hynix, and Micron get along, street prices for memory chips can hold steady for years at a time. In these times of prosperity, Micron's sales and profits skyrocket. The stock generally follows suit. That's what happened in 2012-2014. At the time, Micron had a a newfound pricing power thanks to the recently completed buyout of bankrupt rival Elpida, and the company used this power to full effect. Holding back on production volumes, Micron shifted the global supply-and-demand equation significantly, and memory prices stabilized in a big way: MU data by YCharts Right now, Micron is knee-deep in yet another price war. Samsung is putting the production pedal to the metal, not terribly worried about the effect this market-flooding action is having on memory prices. The Korean giant can afford to take some losses in an attempt to increase its market share, because memory chips are just a small part of a much larger technology conglomerate. Micron doesn't have that luxury to the same degree, as any change in memory prices shows up immediately on the bottom line. That effect has killed plenty of vulnerable memory producers over the years. This is the largest risk, and it weighs heavily on Micron's credit ratings and financial future. As cyclical markets go, this downturn shall eventually pass. One of these days, Samsung will have reached its internal market share goals and shifted into profit-taking mode. Production volumes go down, memory prices stabilize again, and the survivors of the last shakeout get to share another bonanza. Buying Micron today is a bet on this company making it to that next party date. That's a bet I'm perfectly willing to make, thanks to Micron's robust cash balance and solid cash flows even in the face of Samsung's worst market floods. Which stock should you buy? Intel and Micron play very different roles, but are both very welcome parts of my investment portfolio. Micron's next upturn will come, and Intel will continue to chug along like the unstoppable juggernaut it is. If you're on the sidelines of both stocks today, one of these investments will be a much better fit for your investment strategy than the other. Choose accordingly. But for long-term omnivores like yours truly, there are no bad choices here. Anders Bylund owns shares of Intel and Micron Technology. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

USB, Firewire, eSATA, etc: they're not sexy, but they're important. They decide what you can do on your device and how quickly you can do it. So, when Apple introduced its latest MacBook Pro laptops with Thunderbolt 3 ports, you probably didn't think much about it - until you realised that Apple ditched every single port on its old machines and replaced it with just Thunderbolt 3. So, what does that mean? Well, if you want to connect anything to the new MacBook Pro, you'll need to do so via the Thunderbolt 3 ports. You can't simply plug in your devices via existingÂ cables and connectors. If you want to do anything with the new MacBook Pros, you're going to need to buy new cables or adapters with a USB Type-C connector (about Â£226 worth, in fact). Why would Apple do this? The answer is easy: Thunderbolt 3 is the one port to rule them all. Here's everything you need to know. What is Thunderbolt 3? Intel introduced the Thunderbolt platform in 2011 at a time when USB 3.0 was all the rage and could transfer data at speeds up to 5Gbps. Thunderbolt was capable of twice that, plus it could transfer multiple types of data, not just serial data to storage devices. It could, for instance, pipe video data to displays. It could also daisy chain devices together, such as your hard drive to your computer and a display to your hard drive. Intel Thunderbolt 3 is the latest version of Thunderbolt, and it uses the same design as the familiar USB Type-C connector. Intel uses the new connector for a number of reasons. Early versions of Thunderbolt relied on a Mini DisplayPort style connector, and Apple was the only major manufacturer to embrace Thunderbolt. But now that Thunderbolt uses a USB Type-C connector, it is starting to show up in not just new MacBook Pros but also new ultrabooks and notebooks. Thunderbolt 3 first appeared with Intel's Skylake chips that rolled out in 2015, so that's why you're seeing a tonne of devices showing up this year with Thunderbolt 3 ports. Apple is sticking with Thunderbolt 3 because it can do a lot with a single cable. It supports the DisplayPort protocol, for instance, so you can use one cable to daisy-chain and drive multipleÂ 4K displays at 60Hz. Thunderbolt 3 allows for connection speeds up to 40Gbps, double the speed of the previous generation, USB 3.1 10Gbps, and DisplayPort 1.2. It also offers USB speeds of up to 10Gbps, and it can connect up to two 4K displays, outputting video and audio signal at the same time. It also supports DisplayPort 1.2, HDMI 2.0, and 10GbE fast networking. Plus, Thunderbolt 3 is backwards compatible to Thunderbolt 2. What is USB Type-C? Thunderbolt 3 first features a USB Type-C connector. USB Type-C is the latest USB connector that everyone's talking about. It's replacing Micro-USB connectors used by most Android phones and even USB Type-A, which is the standard USB connector people imagine when they hear "USB". Apple's 12-inch MacBook even has a single USB Type-C port. Pocket-lint USB Type-C is well-known because it allows for quicker data transfer. By default, USB Type C offers 7.5W and 15W transmissions, whereas USB 3.0 offers 4.5W transmission. USB Type-C also allows your devices to charge, because it can transmit up to 100W, which is enough to charge most laptops. That means you can use a single cable with a USB Type-C connector to quickly transfer data to your device while you charge it. But the most interesting thing about USB Type-C is that the connector is reversible: there is no "right way up". You can just blindly stick it into a port on a device, and it'll smoothly go in and work. Why is Apple using Thunderbolt 3? Apple has embraced Thunderbolt 3 not only because of its USB Type-C connector but also because of Thunderbolt 3's features. One computer port can connect you to Thunderbolt devices, all displays, and billions of USB devices. It provides four times the data and twice the video bandwidth of any other cable, while also supplying up to 100W of power. You can use it to connect your Mac to displays, transfer data quickly between computers and hard drives, daisy chain external devices, and power up - all with just one physical connection. Intel For years, Macs have had USB ports and Thunderbolt ports and now they're combined. The thing to remember about Thunderbolt 3 is that although it uses the same shapeÂ connector as USB Type-C, it offers support for a wider range of different standards (HDMI, USB, DisplayPort), and it does everything faster while supplying power. You just need the right cable to plug into it. Not all USB Type-C ports support Thunderbolt 3. While smartphones and tablets may use the connector, the Thunderbolt platform is only available on devices with Intel processors. So, while you can technically plug any USB Type-C device or cable into a Thunderbolt 3 port, it won't support Thunderbolt's features. And a Thunderbolt 3 peripheral plugged into a regular USB Type-C port won't support Thunderbolt features either. Do other laptops useÂ Thunderbolt 3? Pocket-lint Apart from Apple's latest MacBook Pro laptops, tonnes of laptops offer Thunderbolt 3 ports. The Asus Transformer 3 and Transformer 3 Pro, Alienware 13, Dell XPS 13, HP Elite X2 and Folio, HP Spectre and Spectre x360, Razer Blade Stealth, Lenovo ThinkPad Y900, and dozens more have shipped with Thunderbolt 3 ports. Ultrabook Review has a comprehensive list of all the laptops now available with Thunderbolt 3. Want to know more? Check out the Thunderbolt 3 promo video above and Intel's FAQ page.

Brianna Gaudi | Marines with 2nd and 3rd Intel Battalion, Ground Sensor Platoons, study their monitors and await activations to call into U.S. Border Patrol. The Marines, under the tactical control of Joint Task Force North worked in support of the U.S. Border Patrol. Their combined mission is to detect, monitor, and alert USBP of potential narcotics smuggling, human trafficking, and illegal personnel. (U.S. Marine Corps photo by Cpl. Brianna Gaudi) Â see less | View Image Page TX, UNITED STATES 09.01.2016 Story by Cpl. Brianna GaudiÂ  II Marine Expeditionary Force â â Subscribe 80 Marines with 2nd and 3rd Intel Battalion, Ground Sensor Platoon, under tactical control of Joint Task Force North, work in support of the U.S. Border Patrol in detecting, identifying, and alerting USBP of potential narcotics smuggling, human trafficking and illegal personnel. Working in conjunction with the U.S. Border Patrol, the primary mission is to detect transnational threats to the homeland in order to prevent terroristsâ weapons, including, weapons of mass destruction, from entering the United States. Several drug trafficking organizations smuggle high volumes of illegal narcotics from Mexico to the United States for mass distribution. Drug smugglers use the heavy vegetation of to avoid surveillance and observation from U.S. Border Patrol in an attempt to evade detention and processing. When apprehended by USBP, undocumented aliens or UDAs are processed and then are transferred to other government agencies for final disposition such as release with court date or deportation. In cases where drugs are involved, the drugs are confiscated and handed over to the Drug Enforcement Agency for proper disposal. Having the Marines there provides a second set of eyes to support the mission. Marines place these sensors along the border in areas of interest known to be popular for crossing. âThese sensors allow the border patrol agents to cover more territory with fewer personnel, allowing them to capture UDAâs and Drug Trafficking Organizations personnel smuggling narcotics from Mexico into the U.S.,â said Col. Russ Draper, the Regional Support Team Chief, Joint Task Force North. âThe Marines are providing a valuable service by helping to increase the capacity to secure the border.â Another device Marines use is an imager, which set up similar to a sensor, is not easily detected. Unlike a sensor, when the imager is activated it captures a picture which can make for easy identification of traffickers. âThe Marine Corps is providing a unique capability that not many organizations have,â Draper said. âTheir professionalism and behavior is impacting JTF-N and enhancing the relationships with the partners they work alongside.â Marines rotated 12 or 24 hour duty evolutions depending on the station they were at. During their duty, Marines watched for activations and when they saw something suspicious they would call it in to the Border Patrol, who would relay the message to agents they have in that area to investigate. The set-up of some of the stations allowed the Marines to work side-by-side with the Border Patrol agents, but for other stations it is important they maintained good communication with each other. With good cooperation, it makes working together easier and allows the group to achieve their common goal. âItâs been a lot of fun, and is really cool to work with another government agency,â said a tactical remote sensor systems technician with 3rd Intel Bn, GSP. âWe learn a lot from each other which makes for a really good experience.â Working with the Border Patrol provided mutual benefits for the Marines. Not only were they able to help, but as a deployment they gained experience in handling and utilizing their equipment. âWe have been coming out here for several years now,â said the section leader with 2nd Intel Bn, GSP. âItâs a great way to employ our gear and get real-world training. You canât recreate this kind of environment and it allows us to test all our capabilities with our equipment.â In past years, the Marines had supported a two-month mission where they would spend only a little time at each station before moving on to the next. This yearâs mission enabled them to bring more gear and cover a greater expanse of the border so they could monitor all stations for the entire operation. âWe love supporting the Border Patrol and want to catch the illicit activity that comes across just as much as they do,â said the section leader with 2nd Intel Bn, GSP. âThe mission allows us to support the Border Patrol for an extended period of time without losing coverage along the border.â With great success during the operation, the Marines have high hopes of returning in the upcoming years. âWe all play a really pivotal role here and we work well together,â said a tactical remote sensor systems technician with 3rd Intel Bn, GSP. âI believe weâll have a lot of success in the future.â LEAVE A COMMENT NEWS INFO Date Taken: 09.01.2016 Date Posted: 10.30.2016 13:38 Story ID: 213275 Location: TX, US Web Views: 249 Downloads: 0 Podcast Hits: 0 PUBLIC DOMAIN Â  This work, Marines, USBP Team up to Protect Border, by Cpl Brianna Gaudi, identified by DVIDS, is free of known copyright restrictions under U.S. copyright law.

Â  Thread Tools Display Modes AMD APU A10 - In need for Informations Â  (#1) dom38fr Newbie Â  Videocard: none Processor: AMD A10-7850K Mainboard: ASUS-A88XM-E-USB3.1 Memory: DDR3 1600 / [2x 2GB] Soundcard: none PSU: 700W AMD APU A10 - In need for Informations - 10-29-2016, 14:26 | posts: 14 | Location: FR Hello, I am writing to you forumers because I am looking for informations and I hope you could help me a little. I have been spending a lot of hours already on the web and I feel like I am almost as clueless as I was when starting. So here is my situation : I have been using this old system for years : Intel Core2 Duo CPU (a desktop one) Gigabyte ATX Motherboard GA-P35C-DS3R Gigabyte nVida GTX470 1GB Two [2x 1 GB] DDR II PC2-6400 800MHz (Kingston & G-Skill) It was enough for my usage and I am not wealthy so I can't really upgrade often. But since roughly 6 months, I was getting BSOD every day, getting worse and worse with time. The cause was faulty SATA controllers (been switching SSD/HDD, cables... checking drivers, well ..definitely a hardware issue). So much I really had to change at least the couple CPU/MB. My brother gave me 2 parts to help : Point Of View nVidia GTX 580 1.5GB [3x 2GB] DD3-1600 PC3-12800 G-Skill Pi Series (a tri-channel i7-designed memory type, somewhat deprecated now if I understood well) When looking for cheap cards / CPU on which I could use these memories, I ran into an annoying fact. Most of the motherboards are now micro-ATX. Buying an ATX (and the choice is reduced to 1 or 2 model only on e-Shopping sites) is actually more expensive. I thought I was forced to do that nonetheless since I have an old ATX case, but after a little research, the holes in it allow to install a micro-ATX as well. But about the huge graphic card... (yes, it's HUGE) I was quite suspicious if I could even stick it in, with all the hard drives and what not. Then about the CPU, Intel was out of question, prices are way too high for me. So I turned to AMD... and discovered about those APU things with integrated powerful graphic capabilities. This would definitely be a good answer to my space issue and watching the web it could run games like Battlefield 4 without any discrete graphic card added and with good results. Well, it doesn't even matter for me, I'm used to play with crappy graphics and framerate and since I am playing only 2 games I just wanted those to work and that's it. One of them being Skyrim and there's also a video demonstrating how the AMD APU performs. So this is what I bought (yes I know it's old already but when you don't have the money you have to cope with it) : AMD APU A10-7850K ASUS-A88XM-E-USB3.1 I was and I am still using Windows 7x64 Ultimate. All this is installed and I have used 2 of the 3 RAM sticks in it (since there are 2 slots only). All drivers installed and well, the system is up and running, no more BSODs (thank god). So what are my concerns ? Well, first I was used to have a nVidia control panel in my display properties where I could set up 3D settings, colors (desktop / videos) and stuff like that... I thought I would have access to that the same way with Catalyst Control Center, which is (just found out) now renamed AMD Radeon Software Crimson. The fact is, it is not there. Nowhere, I have tried using the AMD "autodetectutility" to install the correct drivers/software for my AMD APU, and I also downloaded the 296 Mb file manually and... ok it installs drivers and all this stuff is working but that control center software isn't installed at all. Is this normal ? do I have to install a discrete AMD Card to get access to this ? Next concern is about the performance, to be honest when I'm launching Skyrim, I barely see any difference in performances compared to my old rig, in fact I even feel that it was better before. The game is fine visually and playable but FPS are somewhat crappy (idk, 15-20), and there are some short freeze (less than a second) every now and then. So here are my next questions, what do you think is the cause ? (it's installed on the SSD, as before, it can't really be some slow I/O issue as if it was on a HDD) Are the memories in question ? I was using 4GB (2 pairs of dual 1GB at 800Mhz sticks) and there was 1GB on the card and now it's 4GB too but just a pair of 2GB at 1600Mhz sticks (that I'm not sure works as "dual" since it was "tri" designed) but no VRAM anymore... and it seemed to perform better before. I searched a bit (hours) and learned about that shared memory stuff so I also tried allocating 512MB in the BIOS for the APU Graphic part...didn't help. Finally, I wasn't sure before buying (this is why my choice went to this APU) but I feel like I have enough room to install the GTX580 (didn't try yet, my system is ok now, don't wanna mess up before getting more infos). It's not a compatible Radeon with the A10 APU so I won't be able to enable dual graphics (Crossfire I think it's named). But looking at this article, it should still performs better with than without. I'm still puzzled though. It looks like it works only if the software / game is able to use both computing powers, and I am afraid that they're aren't many, typically an old game like Skyrim. Would it still use the 8 graphic cores for normal computing or leave that totally unused and sleeping (thus meaning I would have wasted money for something I am not using) ? This was a bit long but I prefered giving in-depth details to ensure I am being understood well enough. Thanks for your time, I hope that you will be able to enligthen me on all this !

I used to have an A10 6800K black edition and tested with low and high end graphics cards all game where mostly playable using the A10 6800K black edition APU and graphic's card. I know what it can be like when your on a tight budget, sucks but ya just have make the best of what you have. this should give you some idea of the limits of the CPU side of your apu when put with an graphics card http://www.3dmark.com/compare/3dm11/.../3dm11/8141523 ahh I just realise the i7 is in crossfire I see if have one with i7 and crossfire off so you can see the difference in cpu and same gfx card. use this one to compare http://www.3dmark.com/compare/3dm11/.../3dm11/8030764 pay attention to the physics and combined they will give you an idea of in game difference in cpu performance Last edited by stevevnicks; 10-29-2016 at 15:27.

Did you reinstall your Windows after the mobo-apu upgrade? If not, perhaps give it a try. 2. Not sure which driver did you install, but I think this is the last one for your APU: http://support.amd.com/en-us/downloa...Windows+7+-+64 3. Try DDU as well: http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/...-download.html 4. Since you mentioned FPS I guess you have OSD, you should check cpu usage and temp (maybe thermal throttling?). 5. Is it a heavily modded Skyrim? Because I'm not sure if an APU and 4GB RAM is enough for that. 6. How old is your PSU? 7. Try that GTX580.

My HP laptop with a first generation A8-3500M APU and 1333 DDR3 memory gets 38-55 fps on a mix of Medium and High settings, mostly Medium. Average fps is about 42. Shadow settings need to be low. The graphics are the built in ones and the game has no mods. For the Crimson settings, right click on the desktop and see if the first item listed is Radeon settings. If that isn't present, then the drivers are not installed correctly. However, Crimson drivers are not the recommended ones. Catalyst 15.7.1 is the recommended driver with an option of Crimson 16.2.1. Your graphics are considered legacy now by AMD. I'm using the Crimson 16.2.1 on my laptop and they work well. http://support.amd.com/en-us/downloa...s%207%20-%2064 Last edited by Dch48; 10-30-2016 at 03:03.

Steve, I know a powerful discrete card would be great and I know APU won't give me a Gaming PC, I just wanted it to run an old game like Skyrim and that's it, well enough for my needs (& budget). Spartan, yeah, expanding my RAM size was I think necessary, as I had 4 before, and 4 today... but without the 1Gb on the videocard and that was a 20% difference, even if it was a newer one and faster one. I did not reinstall my system, wasn't necessary imo. At first I am 100% sure I installed the drivers that the autodetect utility gave me.. then, since the control center wasn't anywhere, I tried the most recent drivers, a non-WHQL Package, which I just now found out, didn't contain at all the control center (named "Radeon Settings").. I ended up restarting the installer from the 296MB file on the page you linked and found the software finally ! The CPU temperature and usage are correct, my PSU is 2 years old I think, maybe 3. And trying the GTX 580 was a fail, as I had to dig & remove lots of stuff (drives, cables,..) ... all this to realise I couldn't even plug the power supply, well, pins were missing, it needs a 8-pin + 6 pin connector and my PSU only got 2x 6 pins PCI-E .. apparently there are some adaptors but that would be a waste in my opinion. My game is heavily modded, I guess I will have to tune it up again so that it's playable enough to my taste. But at least I didn't want any freeze or weird artefact (similar to Vertical Sync issue but ..vertical and not horizontal) ...that I didn't have with my old rig. Dch48, as I just wrote, now I do have the Radeon Settings, finally. But your comment is still interesting, since what installed is : WHQL-Win7-64Bit-Radeon-Software-Crimson-16.9.2-Sep29 and you're telling me that they are not recommended, that I should get Catalyst 15.7.1 ... or Crimson 16.2.1, and both are old... so I'm wondering if it's a good idea or not. Finally, after more hours looking for infos on the web, I found out that APU performance was heavily linked with RAM speed (freq, timings). There's even a video demonstrating this. So I had no choice but to buy RAM sticks as well, 2133MHz because it's the sweet spot for it. (and 2400, though raising the perfs a little, was apparently causing some troubles here and there, especially on MB similar to mine) So I bought 2x 4 GB of PC-17000, and I didn't extensively test but I saw instantly that micro-freeze were gone (and I had another small game in which I could see this as well). So this is definitely an improvement. Thanks everyone. Last edited by dom38fr; 11-03-2016 at 18:01.

The drivers I posted are the last ones recommended for non-GCN graphics cards (or APU's). Anything newer is optimized for GCN level cards and probably will not give any improvement on the older hardware. They might even be a downgrade performance wise. Will the newer drivers work? Probably, but they might not be as suitable as the older ones. From what I could find on your APU it has HD8000D series graphics which are non-GCN and classed as legacy. My laptop has HD6620G and is definitely legacy. Yes APU performance is heavily dependent on system RAM speed and it has to be in dual channel mode for the best results. Unfortunately, my laptop only supports up to 1333 RAM and I'm not sure it even runs in Dual channel. Some utilities say yes and some don't. From the performance I get, I think it does.

Going back to your original post I see you said 7850 so yes, you do have the recommended driver. The only problem with the newer APU's is that they will throttle back performance when high temperatues are reached more than the older ones did. My first generation Llano APU doesn't do it at all. So, if your APU is hitting a high enough temperature under load, that could explain the performance issues you reported. From the web it seems that throttling is a known issue with the A10-7850K. The consensus is that it throttles when the GPU part is under load (as in gaming) and the temperature approaches 55C. 55C is not that hot since my laptop will run at 65C all day without any loss in performance and most discrete video cards can stand up to 95C. People seem to think that the stock cooler on the 7850K is insufficient and it needs an aftermarket replacement. Last edited by Dch48; 11-04-2016 at 11:46.

In this mission, we will try to stop the IMC fromÂ taking the ARC- Fold Weapon away from Planet Typhon by directly attacking them head on. So without any further ado, let's begin with the IMC vs Militia War. Trial by Fire Walkthrough Commander Sarah Briggs has scanned our data and this helped us to track the energy signal to an IMC Base on Typhon. Commander has also agreed to BT and kept you as his Permanent Pilot. So let's show her how we can handle the titan and take down the IMC Titans. If you've played the Multiplayer then this War will be a piece of cake for you. Starting from breaking the wall and facing off the first wave of the IMC titans. Note: Keep One pattern Kill the Titan and Collect batteries Make use of the Loadout you are comfortable with and then down the Titans. There will be all types of Titans out there (expect Legion). Keep a distance from Northstar and Ronin as they are pretty quick with their moves. Rest all depends on your gameplay style. Sarah will then lead you to the second wave where you get the Loadout - Northstar. So the best way to try your loadout is against the Titans that will be 2x difficult to take down so you need to find cover and more batteries. Reach the Arc Moving Further to Draconis ship we will have dozens of Reapers blocking our way so try to use the Scorch Loadout to lock and fire them all at once. Take the final wave of Enemy Titans and make it quick before the Draconis take's off. After defeating the Titans, it's time to go Airbourne and try to stop the Draconis from taking away the Arc - Fold Weapon. Thus completing the walkthrough, but we will continue to our next chapter The Arc and Defeat Viper or check our Titanfall 2 Wiki guide to know more about guides, collectible locations, tips, tricks, and cheats.

The Blocker Bugs So Far For Mesa 13.0 Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 29 October 2016 at 08:10 AM EDT. 14 Comments Mesa release manager Emil Velikov has setup a tracker bug to indicate all of the bugs that are blockers for the upcoming Mesa 13.0 release. Mesa 13.0 was branched earlier this month with a plan for weekly release candidates until it's ready to make its debut. Mesa 13.0 is still anticipated for release in early-to-mid November. This is a big update with OpenGL 4.5 support for Intel, GL 4.4/4.5 extension completion for Nouveau NVC0/RadeonSI (but only officially showing OpenGL 4.3 compliance), RADV Radeon Vulkan driver, and many other changes. Obviously with all of the work the past few months, Mesa 13.0 isn't without some regressions. Current nasty bugs/regressions being tracked are the build breaking if linking against non-standard prefixed LLVM, the build running into problems against particular versions of Flex, a few Intel-specific driver bugs, a GLSL test regressions, a swrast Piglit regression, and a Softpipe Piglit regression. It's possible other blocker bugs will get added too as testing continues and this tracker bug was just made on Friday. Bug details on FreeDesktop.org. 14 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Call it an iPad Super-Pro or whatever you want, there's a gap in the lineup. Sarah Tew/CNET Deny it all you want, Apple, but Macs and iPads need to fuse 0 Share: Computers by Scott Stein October 29, 2016 5:00 AM PDT @jetscott Up Next Does the internet have a fake-news problem? The first time I saw the Touch Bar on Apple's new MacBook Pro laptops, I thought: hey, there's a little strip of an iPad grafted onto that Mac. Macs don't have touch. At this point, they're the outliers in the computing world. Windows and Chrome touch computers have flooded the world for years, now. There are tablets. There are phones. There are, well, the iPad and iPhone. Apple says that the Mac and iPad probably won't combine, and that a hybrid touchscreen laptop computer isn't in the company's current plans. Instead, it seems, we have the Touch Bar. The idea of Mac computers not having touchscreens is now so odd that my wife was surprised when I told her. No, she doesn't follow tech. But she hasn't used a Mac in years, either. Apple's new MacBooks Does the Mac still matter? The Mac and iPad aren't merging, get over it The new MacBook Pro's Touch Bar I like the idea of a Touch Bar, or at least having a more customizable keyboard and second-screen controls. I haven't used one yet. And my colleague Dan Ackerman was impressed with his brief hands-on demo of the tech earlier this week. All in all, it seems like a useful way to evolve keyboard interfaces. But the Touch Bar is small. And the Touch Bar isn't a full touch interface like a touchscreen. It feels like Apple's just dipped its toes into touch on the Mac, instead of exploring the full range of what could be. Like, for instance, what you can do on an iPad. That's what makes Apple's statement that the Mac and iPad will never meet even more curious. Maybe they won't. But I bet that hybrid still happens. In fact, it's already happening. And until a new iOS super-device -- or, maybe, a post-iOS super-device -- emerges to take the Mac's place, I'm not thrilled with the divide at all. Pencil support, anyone?Photo by Josh Miller/CNET Hi, meet the iPad I've used iPads to do work. I've tried to make them do everything. I'm writing this story on an iPad Pro, and a MacBook. I alternate. The iPad is something that's so close to a full computer, even Tim Cook beckons us to make the switch. But it's still not fully there. It does around 70 percent of what I need. The rest, due mainly to OS design and some software and hardware limitations, is a challenge. Apple's software engineering chief tells us why there's no touchscreen Mac Craig Federighi discusses the thinking behind the Touch Bar, describes the challenges of adding Touch ID - and reveals that Apple had built several touchscreen prototypes. by Connie Guglielmo 5:21 Close Drag We're well past the time when a touchscreen of any sort should be considered cool. It's standard issue. From here on in, it's all about touch as a tool. Apple's iPad tablets and Windows PCs are useful because their entire canvas can be versatile. You can touch. Or, you can not. Sliders or palettes can be anywhere. Microsoft is already pushing into something different: tools that interact with touch. Microsoft's new Surface Dial, a haptic metal wheel that rests on Windows displays to create an instant pop-up interface, feels like an augmented expansion of the touchscreen. Gimmicky? Maybe. But when everything's touchable, controls can be anywhere. Compare that to the Touch Bar, which is one strip, one place. Do I think the Mac is going touch in the future? Maybe not. But I think Apple's already got the pieces to the puzzle of touch-screen computing lying right in front of us. The Touch Bar is the start of bringing some form of a touchscreen to the Mac.Photo by James Martin/CNET Why Apple's probably waiting The iOS and MacOS operating systems remain separate beasts, year after year. I think I know why. Apple effectively makes its own chips for iOS devices. (They are manufactured by companies such as TSMC, but custom-designed by Apple.) And they're getting more powerful every year. Good enough to replace the Intel chips used in a power professional Mac? Not yet. But there's already some anecdotal evidence that they're getting awfully close. One benchmark, as highlighted recently by Apple pundit John Gruber, suggests that the iPhone 7's A10 processor can go toe-to-toe with the Intel CPU found in the 2013 MacBook Air. Whether the comparison is 100 percent accurate or not is almost besides the point. In the next few years, Apple's "mobile" chips look to be on target to meet or exceed Intel's computer CPUs in terms of raw processing power. At that point, the only thing holding back an iPad is software and accessories. And Apple actually is positioning it as a full-fledged Mac replacement. A future, more powerful hybrid computer with Apple's own processors could mean more flexibility in design. Or it could mean Apple controls the future of its product even more. The future of magic do-it-all tablets is already here...let it happen As Apple's Craig Federighi said regarding iPads and Macs, "To attempt to bend one into the other is at its root to make a compromise." Fair enough. While a touch-based Mac is easy enough to envision from a hardware perspective, bringing its cursor-based interface along for the ride could indeed be a bridge too far. Windows did a few years ago, but at a great expense: remember the rough years of user discontent that was Windows 8. But those "compromises" Federighi aims to avoid are already happening on the Mac, to some degree. Some people have already grumbled about the disappearance of MagSafe, or the shift to USB-C type ports that will require more dongles for now. And there's skepticism about the Touch Bar. After all, it requires app support. The iPhone's 3D Touch has taken a while to develop meaningful uses across iOS 10, and many third-party apps I use were slow to support it. Will Touch Bar be better? Change is perpetual. I read Apple's executive comments on the Mac and how it would weaken with touch, and how the iPad shouldn't necessarily be like a Mac, and I thought...regular people can't afford two expensive, large-screen devices with an increasingly large functional overlap. I bought a laptop last year because my previous one was eight years old, and no iPad has the software underpinnings to replace the needs I have. But, I bought it for utility. Meanwhile, iOS is the touch-friendly landscape. It's also where Apple's next-gen creative tools lie, like Pencil. But you know what? Apple can converge the two. It should. My son recently had a birthday party where he and his friends played Minecraft. They gathered around touch laptops, touched the screens and had fun. They know how to use them because that's what they do: use touchscreens. The iPad can be a utility device too. And if the iPad Pro can have a keyboard and a stylus, it can have a lot more. If the Mac won't evolve to accept touchscreens, then bring on the advanced iOS hardware...because my kids, and the rest of the world, are waiting. I don't care what they're called.

The boards of both companies have already unanimously approved the all-cash deal representing a total enterprise value of about $47 billion. The new entity will be able to address thousands of devices and the combined expertise of both companies will be particularly important for automotive, mobile and IoT industries, which are poised for growth. The combined company will be one of the worldâs largest suppliers of semiconductors in general, with revenues comparable to those of Samsung and Intel. However, it is not going to be easy to combine the assets of Qualcomm and NXP under one company. The Biggest Semiconductor Transaction Ever Qualcomm intends to pay $110 for every NXP share, or for $37.88 billion (according to estimates by Reuters, based on the companyâs 344.4 million diluted shares as of early October), which represents around 10% premium compared to the stock price of around $98.66 at close on Wednesday. When NXPâs debt is included, the enterprise value goes up to around $47 billion in total. Last week several media outlets reported that the NXP management wanted to get $120 per share, but agreed to $110 proposed by Qualcomm. In fact, given that the NXPI stock was trading in the range between $61.61 and $107.54 in the last 12 months, $110 seems to be a rather fair price. Qualcomm headquarters. Photo by Coolcaesar at en.wikipedia What is interesting is that Qualcomm intends to buy NXP in an all-cash deal, which means that the company will have to borrow money, as it has around $17 billion in cash and other short-term assets its pockets today (according to U.S. regulators). Even adding in long-term securities only brings Qualcomm's piggy bank to around $30 billion in total. Qualcommâs total debt as of today is $11.77 billion and with a new multi-billion loan (or loans) as well as NXPâs debt, its total debt will be well over $20 billion. The company does not reveal the names of its creditors right now, but it admits that it will have to borrow money to pay to NXP shareholders as well as liabilities of the company eventually. Qualcomm and NXP intend to close the deal by the end of calendar 2017, after regulators in various jurisdictions approve the buyout. What is noteworthy is that the two companies are starting their integration effort today, well before they get all the approvals they need, which shows their confidence in the deal closing, and confirms that it will not be easy to merge the two multi-billion corporations. If everything goes as planned, the transaction valued at approximately $47 billion will be the largest semiconductor takeover ever. Last year Avago paid $37 billion for Broadcom and earlier this year Softbank bought ARM for $32 billion. From an economics points of view, large chip-related acquisitions in the recent years are not surprising. Electronics get more complex and more expensive to develop. As a result, semiconductor companies need to expand their businesses to gain access to and volume in various existing and emerging devices. Moreover, by taking over other companies, chip developers not only get IP they need, but can also cut down certain costs and/or get rid of competitors. Finally, as companies get bigger, it gets easier for them to negotiate with their suppliers because now they need to get more goods or services. Qualcomm and NXP: More Than the Sum of All Parts? Qualcomm will create a rather formidable force in the semiconductor world by combining two very different companies with 72,000 employees in total. However, the giant machine that Qualcomm and NXP are going to create may be worth more than the sum of their capitalizations if everything goes according to plan. Right now Qualcomm is the worldâs largest supplier of SoCs for mobile devices and telecom equipment. Last fiscal year the company earned $25 billion in revenue: $17B from selling chips and $8B from technology licensing. In the recent years Qualcomm has been trying to diversify its business and offered various solutions for automotive, IoT, healthcare and even datacenter industries. While the company has been gradually expanding its product portfolio with various solutions, mobile SoCs has remained its bread and butter for products sold. Moreover, some of the markets and products categories hard to break into due factors such as conservative approach of manufacturers, very long development cycles, etc. For example, despite of having CPU, GPU, sensors and other IP, Qualcomm has never made into Top 10 suppliers of automotive semiconductors (according to IHS). By contrast, NXP has been focusing on mixed-signal semiconductors as well as various specialized microprocessors and microcontrollers. NXPs chips are used inside automobiles, in healthcare equipment, NFC equipment (in fact, NXP was one of the inventors of the technology) and in hundreds of other devices. Based on data from IHS, NXP earned $9.72 billion in revenue last year. While Qualcomm and NXP overlap in certain areas, they aren't direct rivals in any significant sense of the word; the sum of their revenues come from different markets. Therefore, the acquisition will be complementary for Qualcomm because it greatly expands its addressable markets (potentially up to $138 billion in 2020) and brings thousands of new clients (Qualcomm says that NXP serves 25K direct and indirect customers). The combined company will have revenue of well over $30 billion and will be the worldâs No. 3 supplier of semiconductors after Intel ($51 billion in 2015) and Samsung ($40 billion), based on rankings from IHS. Keep in mind that Samsung sells tons of commodity DRAM and NAND flash memory, whereas the new Qualcomm will specialize on various general purpose, automotive, IoT and special purpose computing solutions. In fact, the new Qualcomm will be a rather unique company with no direct rivals of comparable sizes, as companies like Avago (together with Broadcom), MediaTek, Texas Instruments, Renesas and other earn considerably less. During the conference call with investors and financial analysts, the management of Qualcomm and NXP emphasized multiple times that the new company will not only be able to develop unique solutions thanks to massive amount of IP available to leverage (some of which goes back to semi IP from Motorola and Philips), but will be able to address automotive and IoT industries better than its competitors. In the best case scenario, Qualcomm will be able to offer highly-integrated platforms for hundreds of emerging devices from smart wearables to 5G-enabled IoT equipment to self-driving automobiles with wireless charging, in addition to more advanced platforms for hardware we use today, such as smartphones, routers or servers. At the same time, while the management teams accentuate that the transaction is not about cutting costs or synergies, it is inevitable that there will be redundancies and optimizations. Therefore, some existing projects are expected to be cancelled (it will be interesting to see what happens to Freescaleâs CPUs, for example) and some will be merged. Qualcomm predicts that two years after the two firms merge, the new company will save at least $500 million annually. The Road Ahead The acquisition of NXP clearly makes a lot of sense for Qualcomm, but the integration of the two companies is not going to be easy. Firstly, NXP is still integrating Freescale Semiconductor (the deal closed last December). Secondly, NXP has its own semiconductor fabs (all of which are outdated and Qualcomm has never had its own fabs). Thirdly, NXP has more employees than Qualcomm itself (45K vs 27K). Finally, the new company will have to remain very agile to remain competitive on rapidly developing markets, such as smartphones. Executives of Qualcomm said on Thursday that the combined company would be managed by execs from both firms, who know how certain businesses work. For example, Qualcomm plans to use NXPâs sales teams to sell Qualcomm-branded devices for IoT because these people know the market and know how to address it. In the meantime, Qualcomm does not have immediate plans to get rid of NXP's semiconductor production facilities and NXPâs execs will continue to manage them. But in longer term, the company may reconsider its approach to manufacturing as Qualcomm has long based its business around being a fabless semiconductor. Overall, while the integration efforts are underway, there are things that may change between now and late 2017, when the deal is expected to close. Therefore, only time will tell how the combined company will look like and how it will be managed. No matter how optimistic execs from Qualcomm and NXP sound today about the prospects of the merged company, it will be a very tough job to blend the two firms. Nevertheless, the importance of connected devices will only grow in the coming years (one may call it the 5G era) and therefore having the whole package of IP needed to build different kinds of devices (from water quality sensors to smart cars and smart buildings) is clearly important.

POST A COMMENT 30 Comments View All Comments witeken - Friday, October 28, 2016 - link "with revenues comparable to those of Samsung and Intel." Uh, Intel is still 2x Qualcomm. Reply witeken - Friday, October 28, 2016 - link Also, in the discussion of why their is so much M&A in 2015-6, you forgot the most important thing: the semiconductor market is slowing down, so M&A is just another way for companies to deliver value to the shareholders. Reply Mondozai - Saturday, October 29, 2016 - link The semiconductor market is only entering a lull as the smartphone growth phase is coming to a close. This deal is positioned for the next phase, which is the IoT era. Therefore, it is incorrect to paint this as a purely defensive move to shareholders. It's about positioning it for the next growth stage. Whether it will succeed or not is anyone's guess, but the stated intention of the deal and underlying logic is sound. Reply ddriver - Saturday, October 29, 2016 - link The bubble keeps growing, it would have taken qualcomm 1/10 of that to develop an analog to nxp's entire product like from scratch. Wouldn't want to be there when it finally bursts. I guess they are doing it for the patents rather than the actual technology, as in it would be cheaper to take over rather than pay royalties. Reply Wwhat - Sunday, October 30, 2016 - link There is a difference between slowing down and growth slowing down. The first means a trend downwards, the second is just saturation. Reply emn13 - Monday, October 31, 2016 - link According to this article, Intel's revenues are 51B, and the meged companies revenues are 35B. Intel does not earn 2x 35B, as you suggest. Personally, I doubt that a 35B vs. 51B revenue matters all that much when it comes to where a company is going, so I'd call those comparable (I'd call a 2x difference comparable too). With the right sales channels, tech, IP etc. a 35B company might easily out-compete a 51B company (and the reverse is obviously true too). Reply Lolimaster - Saturday, October 29, 2016 - link So in the near future we will see Qualcomm branded smartphones. Reply ddriver - Saturday, October 29, 2016 - link nxp's product line is "lower level" compared to qualcomm, they mostly make micro-controllers, that won't really be bringing qualcomm any closer to smartphones, they are already as close as it gets having numerous complete SOCs with integrated modems in their portfolio. Reply Gondalf - Saturday, October 29, 2016 - link Hopefully this merger will goes well. Npx is not in a good siuation and sure is not growing, Qualcomm is shrinking with a semiconductor revenue of only 16B, the rest is patents revenue. So yes the agglomeration is exactly half Intel and a lot less than Samsung Semicondutors. In my mind they paid too much for Npx, epecially they don't have a good FAB to offer, but only little 200mm FABs to be shut down in a short time due obsolescence. Anyway Qualcomm knows that its revenue is going down year after year cause Mediatek and many other companies so this could be a manner to stay alive with a good revenue. Reply emn13 - Monday, October 31, 2016 - link NXP was nearly bankrupt just a few years ago. Accumulating around 100B in value in a few years certainly doesn't sound like they're doing very poorly.

The initiative would levy a 2.5 percent tax on many companies' Oregon sales over $25 million. But Measure 97 exempts some types of businesses and applies differently to others. The measure's backers say Oregon's business taxes are unusually low, and argue Measure 97 would make large companies pay their fair share for state services. Opponents call the initiative a hidden sales tax, and say consumers would end up paying some of the bill. It's a complex, unusual initiative. Here are some answers to the questions we frequently hear about the tax. Are Oregon's business taxes really so low? Yes, at least relatively speaking. Businesses pay 37.6 percent of Oregon's state and local tax revenue, according to estimates by the Council on State Taxation. That compares to 45 percent nationally. As a share of total economic activity in the state, Oregon businesses' tax bills are the lowest in the nation. Those rankings reflect the absence of an Oregon sales tax, which in other states is paid by both consumers and businesses. They also reflect a relatively high personal income tax (which helps compensate for the low business taxes) and Oregon's unusually robust economic output, skewed upward by one extremely large manufacturer: Intel. A May study by the nonpartisan Legislative Revenue Office found Measure 97 would move Oregon businesses' share of the state's total tax burden to 45.4 percent, on par with the national average. What happens to the economy if voters raise business taxes? The legislative study found both positive and negative effects. Oregon would still see employment growth, about 145,000 jobs over five years. But without Measure 97, the state could expect more than 165,000 new jobs, the study found. That's the net effect of more public sector jobs and slower growth in private sector jobs. Overall, the study said Measure 97 would be a very modest drag on the economy, slowing growth in income, employment and population. In each case, though, growth under Measure 97 would still be within 1 percent of current forecasts. The study also said additional investment in education could provide a long-term economic boost. What would consumers pay? Unlike a conventional sales tax, paid by shoppers, Measure 97 levies taxes on businesses. Measure 97's authors say the big businesses subject to the tax would absorb the whole cost, insulating consumers. Many others, including Gov. Kate Brown â a Measure 97 supporter âÂ say it's evident businesses would pass on some of their higher costs. Economists say how much businesses pass along would depend on their market power. Cable television companies, for example, may pass along much of the cost. Private utilities such as Portland General Electric have regulated monopolies and a legal right to pass along higher costs â including taxes â to ratepayers. Other states exempt wholesalers from consumption and sales taxes, or they tax wholesale trade at a lower rate. Because Measure 97 does not, some economists expect a "pyramiding" effect in which added costs are stacked atop one another for some products and services. Conventional sales taxes in other states usually exempt food from taxation. Measure 97 does not. So if businesses do pass along higher costs, it could produce higher grocery bills. The legislative study âÂ which was based on an approximation of Measure 97 âÂ concluded it would both dampen wage growth and raise prices. The effect varies depending on household income: Households making less than $48,000 a year would see a 0.9 percent decrease in after-tax income. For a household making $34,000 to $48,000 a year, that's $563 less. Oregon's annual median household income is roughly $61,000. For families in that range, Measure 97 means $613 less, a 0.8 percent decline in income. The cost would rise in higher income brackets, but the proportion of the impact would decline. For wealthy households, with after-tax income topping $206,000, Measure 97 would cost nearly $1,300 a year â a 0.4 percent hit. Where does the money go? Measure 97 could give lawmakers $6 billion more to spend in Oregon's next two-year budget, growing the state's general fund by a third. The measure says it will fund "public early childhood and kindergarten through twelfth-grade education, healthcare; and, services for senior citizens." Some of the money would go elsewhere, though. The Oregon Legislative Counsel concluded that under Oregon law about $250 million in Measure 97 revenue from gas stations and similar businesses must go to the state Highway Fund. Because Measure 97 isn't a constitutional amendment, the Legislature could spend the money any way it chooses. As a practical matter, though, lawmakers would likely spend most of the money as prescribed. In the current budget, more than three-quarters of state spending goes to education or social services. What about rising public pension costs? How much of Measure 97's revenue would that eat? Some of Measure 97's revenue could help offset a more than $800 million spike in pension costs that followed the Oregon Supreme Court's ruling last year that tossed out prior pension reforms. That's creating a substantial part of the budget deficit Measure 97 would address. Who supports Measure 97? It's an initiative, put on the ballot by public employee unions. They maintain their ballot measure would rectify a tax imbalance in Oregon, in which businesses pay a steadily smaller share of state revenue. The biggest contributors to the "Yes" campaign are public employee unions, especially the teacher's union. The "Yes" campaign has raised more than $12 million. Another union-backed effort, which is supporting Measure 97 and six other ballot measures, has raised more than $1 million this year. Who's against it? Retailers are the biggest contributors to the "No" campaign â Costco, Safeway/Albertsons (the two grocers share an owner) and Fred Meyer. The "No" campaign has raised a little more than $25 million. OK, who would pay the tax? Of roughly 250,000 businesses registered in Oregon in 2013, the legislative study found that 951 would qualify based on their corporate status, sales volume and income. The study concluded the 100 largest taxpayers would pay two-thirds of the burden. Here are some industries with the largest potential tax increases under Measure 97, according to the study: Wholesalers: Their taxes would jump 583 percent, from $102.1 million to $697.3 million. Retailers: Taxes would climb 766 percent, from $69.8 million to $604.8 million. Health care: Taxes would leap 1,211 percent, from $7.9 million to $103.6 million. Within industries, the tax will apply differently to different types of companies. The measure applies to one kind of business (known as a C-corporation) but exempts two others (S-corporations and "benefit companies.") There are many distinctions among the various types of companies, and different tax implications for each corporate status. For our purposes, think of it this way: C-corporations frequently have many investors, like a publicly traded corporation. S-corporations have few owners. Sometimes that's a family-owned business, but it can also be a large business controlled by one person or company. A "benefit company" is a special category of business under Oregon law, established to create public benefits in addition to profits for the owners. Is there a list of which companies would be subject to Measure 97? No. State officials have private tax data that shows the corporate status of each company in the state, but say that information is not subject to the state's public disclosure laws. So except for large, public companies that disclose their corporate status to investors (most all of those are C-corps), there's no way to know for sure. Safeway, for example, initially claimed its corporate status exempts it from Measure 97. Then it reversed itself and said it is subject to the initiative. Because Safeway is a privately held company, there's no way to know for sure which statement is accurate. What about Oregon's biggest companies â Intel, Nike, Precision Castparts and Lithia Motors? All are subject to Measure 97. But it would affect one of them very differently. Measure 97's tax generally applies only to sales that take place within Oregon. So Intel, Nike and Precision Castparts â which sell almost all their products to customers outside the state â will likely pay very little under Measure 97. (The tax could affect Intel indirectly, though, if the equipment companies that supply its Hillsboro factories raise prices.) It's a different story with Lithia, a Medford company that operates a chain of auto dealerships. In its last quarterly report, Lithia warned investors the Oregon initiative represents a risk factor that would raise the company's Oregon tax bill from $3.3 million to $34 million. Lithia reported $183 million in profits last year. "This tax may have a disproportionate effect on us as certain Oregon dealers we compete against may not be organized as C corporations and would not be subject to this tax," Lithia wrote in its quarterly report. Why are tech companies so upset about Measure 97? The initiative taxes most companies based on their sales within Oregon. But it treats software and other services businesses very differently. Through a quirk of existing state law, Oregon companies' software appears subject to Measure 97 taxes â no matter where companies sell the software. Gov. Brown has acknowledged the issue and proposed that legislators create an exemption for software and services if Measure 97 passes so those industries are treated the same as others. Lawmakers have indicated they would do that, but it's impossible to know for sure what would happen as they began weighing trade-offs around other changes to the law. What happens if Measure 97 fails? Oregon projects a shortfall of $1.35 billion in its next budget. Without additional revenue, Brown says state agencies would have to cut their budgets by 10 percent. Measure 97 is the only proposal on the table, right now, to supply additional revenue. Lawmakers have periodically discussed broad tax reform, and, as recently as last spring, some had discussed a legislative alternative to Measure 97. Those talks are sure to resume if voters reject Measure 97, but it's not clear they have a better chance of success than prior efforts. Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Lithia's estimate of the tax impact of Measure 97. The company says the initiative would increase its Oregon tax liability from $3.3 million to $34 million, not from a range of $3.3 million to $34 million. â Mike Rogoway mrogoway@oregonian.com 503-294-7699 @rogoway Insurance Guide 2017 Need help with open enrollment?

A committed Christian who nearly went into the church rather than technology, he gives away 40pc of his salary, prays and sings hymns on journeys from his Californian office to the airport and resolved early in life to never read his daily business newspaper until he had first read the Bible. Right now, however, all that everybody wants to hear is how the chief executive of VMware, the $32bn (Â£26.2bn) market capitalisation US technology group, is getting on with Michael Dell. There are no assets in a software company other than the people Dellâs eponymous private equity-backed computer-maker has just paid $67bn for EMC, the American group that owns 80pc of VMware, and the 10,000-strong following at the VMworld Europe conference in Barcelona this month was awash with interest in how the duo will gel. Gelsinger, after all, is a technocrat who worked for 30 years at Intel, rising to chief technology officer, while entrepreneurial Dell famously founded the PC company in his Austin, Texas college dorm. âWeâre getting on very well,â insists Gelsinger, 54. âWeâve just had our first board meeting with Michael as the new presiding chairman of my board and Iâd say that, overall, while itâs early and I donât think either one of us would say weâve figured it all out yet, all signs are encouraging. âWeâve committed to $1bn of synergies, so we have to go and start building the organisations to materialise that.â Such caution typifies Gelsingerâs understated approach. More Bill Gates than Larry Ellison, he is down to earth, engaging and ever-polite. Gelsinger has been working alongside Michael Dell Credit: julian simmonds What are his impressions of his new boss so far? Heâs pleased that Dell declared his support for VMwareâs âecosystemâ of reseller partners at the companyâs even larger VMworld US conference in Las Vegas. He thinks Dell was impressed by that eventâs 25,000-strong crowd â more than double the attendees at the EMC or Dell annual shindigs. Thereâs a lot for Dell to get his head around. EMC was an unusual company with a portfolio strategy of nurturing part-owned businesses including VMware and Pivotal, a spin-off owned together with Microsoft, Ford and General Electric and chaired by Paul Maritz, the veteran former Microsoft and VMware executive. âMichael has quite bought into that strategy,â says Gelsinger. âHe definitely understands that a software company like VMware is a different company, a different culture. âSoftware people are different to people doing hardware and supply chain. There are no assets in a software company other than the people. Thatâs a key aspect of running a company like ours and he sees us as a very successful business. âHeâs giving us the space and support to go out and execute what we need to do. And he has a lot to get done in merging Dell and EMC. There are 140,000 people to put together there, big product lines to merge and organisations to form.â VMwareâs name stands for âvirtual machine softwareâ â technology that essentially allows firms to pack their data on far fewer server computers. The company recently struck important alliances with cloud computing leader Amazon and with IBM. It is retaining its stock market listing following the takeover. âI have the pleasure of seeing the shareholders every 90 days,â Gelsinger smiles. However, VMwareâs shares nearly halved from $80 to a low of $43 after the dealâs announcement. âThat was a pretty painful process,â he says. âThere were clearly concerns about whether Dell could make a software company successful. âThere were questions around a tracking stock that was part of the takeover and the implications of that. As with any big acquisition, there were also concerns about whether the deal would get done.â Michael Dell on Cloud Technology, U.S. Election & Economy Play! 07:29 There were also questions about VMwareâs business, as the guidance it gave on earnings last year was less than Wall Street expected. However, the stock price rose as the companies got closer to completing the deal. âWeâve been able to affirm to the marketplace the continuing ecosystem and independence of VMware and some of the new product areas and cloud strategy weâve rolled out have helped address some of the concerns,â says Gelsinger. âWith the shares now around Â£77, weâre still not trading at the software multiple that we should have, so weâre not entirely through the fog. But weâve come a long way and I believe thereâs tremendous upside potential.â Gelsinger, who chairs Transforming Bay with Christ, a group aimed at bringing about âspiritual and societalâ change in the San Francisco area, clearly runs VMware with the same kind of missionary zeal. He talks about âdigital transformationâ and how some of the worldâs biggest businesses are simplifying their IT infrastructures to innovate at a more rapid pace. With machine-driven devices predicted to overtake human-driven efforts by 2019, he feels that many businesses are still totally unprepared for the imminent explosion of the âinternet of thingsâ. Where Will VMWare Find New Customers Play! 05:00 He also holds that the tech sector is still in its âteenage years,â with huge tensions between its control and freedom. Half of the biggest US technology firms will have disappeared in 10 yearsâ time due to these and other difficulties, he predicts. He wonât name any, of course, but Nokia, BlackBerry and Yahoo are three IT brands whose star has dimmed significantly since he predicted major industry carnage in The Daily Telegraph three years ago, while British computer chip designer ARM and of course EMC have been taken over. VMware, however, has been an excellent investment for EMC. Founded by Diane Greene and her husband Mendel Rosenblum with colleagues in California in 1998, it was bought by EMC six years later for Â£625m. In 2007 EMC floated the company on the New York Stock Exchange, retaining an 80pc stake. Maritz replaced Greene as CEO, quadrupling revenues to $4.5bn. Then Gelsinger switched over from EMC to succeed Maritz in 2012. VMware now has 400,000 customers, 19,000 workers, 2015 revenues of $6.6bn and 120 locations around the world, including its UK headquarters in Frimley, Surrey. Gelsinger grew up on a farm in Pennsylvania. His father was one of nine children, while his mother was from a family of 11 and he skipped his last year of high school at the age of 17 to take up a scholarship to study electronics at Lincoln Technical Institute in his home state. His faith clearly drives him. He led a weekly home Bible study for 16 years and served as a Sunday school teacher, while his philanthropy supports medical relief, church planting organisations, educational work and an orphanage the he and his wife Linda helped build in Nairobi. At Intel, which he joined from the institute, he frequently worked 80-hour weeks, arousing complaints from the payroll department that he was working too much overtime. To fix that, for a period in his married life, he and Linda devised a system whereby he would score two points if he got home before 5pm, one point if before 6.15pm, zero after that and minus one point for being away at weekends. Heâs even written about it in a book called Balancing Your Family, Faith and Work. âIâve written three books now and Iâm working on my fourth,â Gelsinger smiles. Itâs one of those labours of love.â As is the merger of course. Watch this space.

And following Baronâs example I also run the same load against MonetDB. Reading comments to Baronâs post I tied to load the same data to LucidDB, but I was not successful in this. I tried to analyze a bigger dataset and I took public available data http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time about USA domestic flights with information about flight length and delays. The data is available from 1988 to 2009 in chunks per month, so I downloaded 252 files (for 1988-2008 years) with size from 170MB to 300MB each. In total raw data is about 55GB. Average amount of rows in each chunk is 483762.46 (the query Q0 is: Shell 
 select avg(c1) from (select year,month,count(*) as c1 from ontime group by YEAR,month) t; 1 select avg(c1) from (select year,month,count(*) as c1 from ontime group by YEAR,month) t; for InfoBright and Shell 
with t as (select yeard,monthd,count(*) as c1 from ontime group by YEARD,monthd) select AVG(c1) FROM t 1 with t as (select yeard,monthd,count(*) as c1 from ontime group by YEARD,monthd) select AVG(c1) FROM t for MonetDB. For InfoBright it took 4.19 sec to execute and 29.9 sec for MonetDB, but itâs almost single case where MonetDB was significantly slower) Few words about environment: server Dell SC1425, with 4GB of RAM and Dual Intel(R) Xeon(TM) CPU 3.40GHz. InfoBright (ICE) version: 5.1.14-log build number (revision)=IB_3.2_GA_5316(ice) MonetDB version: server v5.14.2, based on kernel v1.32.2 LucidDB was 0.9.1 The table I loaded data is: Shell

Load procedure: Infobright: the loader that comes with ICE version is very limited and I had to transform files to quote each field. After that load statement is: Shell 
mysql -S /tmp/mysql-ib.sock -e "LOAD DATA INFILE '/data/d1/AirData_ontime/${YEAR}_$i.txt.tr' INTO TABLE ontime FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '\"'" ontime 1 mysql -S /tmp/mysql-ib.sock -e "LOAD DATA INFILE '/data/d1/AirData_ontime/${YEAR}_$i.txt.tr' INTO TABLE ontime FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '\"'" ontime The load time for each chunk was about 30s/chunk in initial years and up to 48s/chunk for 2008 year. And total load time is 8836 sec (2.45h). The size of database after load is 1.6G which is impressive and give 1:34 compress ratio. MonetDB: It took some time to figure out how to load text data ( I really wish developers improve documentation), but finally I ended up with next load statement: Shell 
/usr/local/monetdb/bin/mclient -lsql --database=ontime -t -s "COPY 700000 records INTO ontime FROM '/data/d1/AirData_ontime/${Y
EAR}_$i.txt' USING DELIMITERS ',','\n','\"' NULL AS '';" 1 2 /usr/local/monetdb/bin/mclient -lsql --database=ontime -t -s "COPY 700000 records INTO ontime FROM '/data/d1/AirData_ontime/${Y EAR}_$i.txt' USING DELIMITERS ',','\n','\"' NULL AS '';" Load time: 13065 sec ( 3.6h) Database size after load is 65G , which is discouraging. It seems it does not use any compression, and itâs bigger than original data. LucidDB Here it took time to find how to execute command from command line using included Shell 
sqlline 1 sqlline utility, and I did not understand how to do that, so I generated big SQL file which contained load statements. Load of each chunk was significantly slower starting with about 60 sec/chunk for initial year and constantly growing to 200 sec / chunk for 2000 year. On 2004 year (after about 5h of loading) the load failed by some reason and I did not try to repeat, as I would not fit in timeframe I allocated for this benchmark. Maybe I will try sometime again. Query execution So I really have data for InfoBright and MonetDB, let see how fast they are in different queries. First favorite query for any database benchmarker is Shell 
SELECT count(*) FROM ontime; 1 SELECT count(*) FROM ontime; . Both InforBritgh and MonetDB executes it immediately with result 117023290 rows Now some random queries I tried again both databases: -Q1: Count flights per day from 2000 to 2008 years Shell 
SELECT DayOfWeek, count(*) AS c FROM ontime WHERE YearD BETWEEN 2000 AND 2008 GROUP BY DayOfWeek ORDER BY c DESC 1 SELECT DayOfWeek, count(*) AS c FROM ontime WHERE YearD BETWEEN 2000 AND 2008 GROUP BY DayOfWeek ORDER BY c DESC with result: [ 5, 7509643 ] [ 1, 7478969 ] [ 4, 7453687 ] [ 3, 7412939 ] [ 2, 7370368 ] [ 7, 7095198 ] [ 6, 6425690 ] And it took 7.9s for MonetDB and 12.13s for InfoBright. -Q2: Count of flights delayed more than 10min per day of week for 2000-2008 years Shell 
SELECT DayOfWeek, count(*) AS c FROM ontime WHERE DepDelay>10 AND YearD BETWEEN 2000 AND 2008 GROUP BY DayOfWeek ORDER BY c DESC 1 SELECT DayOfWeek, count(*) AS c FROM ontime WHERE DepDelay>10 AND YearD BETWEEN 2000 AND 2008 GROUP BY DayOfWeek ORDER BY c DESC Result: [ 5, 1816486 ] [ 4, 1665603 ] [ 1, 1582109 ] [ 7, 1555145 ] [ 3, 1431248 ] [ 2, 1348182 ] [ 6, 1202457 ] And 0.9s execution for MonetDB and 6.37s for InfoBright. -Q3: Count of delays per airport for years 2000-2008 Shell 
SELECT Origin, count(*) AS c FROM ontime WHERE DepDelay>10 AND YearD BETWEEN 2000 AND 2008 GROUP BY Origin ORDER BY c DESC LIMIT 10 1 SELECT Origin, count(*) AS c FROM ontime WHERE DepDelay>10 AND YearD BETWEEN 2000 AND 2008 GROUP BY Origin ORDER BY c DESC LIMIT 10 [ âORDâ, 739286 ] [ âATLâ, 736736 ] [ âDFWâ, 516957 ] [ âPHXâ, 336360 ] [ âLAXâ, 331997 ] [ âLASâ, 307677 ] [ âDENâ, 306594 ] [ âEWRâ, 262007 ] [ âIAHâ, 255789 ] [ âDTWâ, 248005 ] with 1.7s for MonetDB and 7.29s for InfoBright -Q4: Count of delays per Carrier for 2007 year Shell 
SELECT carrier, count(*) FROM ontime WHERE DepDelay>10  AND YearD=2007 GROUP BY carrier ORDER BY 2 DESC 1 SELECT carrier, count(*) FROM ontime WHERE DepDelay>10Â Â AND YearD=2007 GROUP BY carrier ORDER BY 2 DESC [ âWNâ, 296293 ] [ âAAâ, 176203 ] â¦ With 0.27s for MonetDB and 0.99sec for InfoBright But it obvious that the more flight carrier has, the more delays, so to be fair, letâs calculate -Q5: Percentage of delays for each carrier for 2007 year. It is a bit more trickier, as for InfoBright and MonetDB you need different query: MonetDB: Shell 
WITH t AS (SELECT carrier, count(*) AS c FROM ontime WHERE DepDelay>10  AND YearD=2007 GROUP BY carrier), t2 AS (SELECT carrier, count(*) AS c2 FROM ontime WHERE YearD=2007 GROUP BY carrier) SELECT t.carrier, c, c2, c*1000/c2 as c3 FROM t JOIN t2 ON (t.Carrier=t2.Carrier) ORDER BY c3 DESC 1 WITH t AS (SELECT carrier, count(*) AS c FROM ontime WHERE DepDelay>10Â Â AND YearD=2007 GROUP BY carrier), t2 AS (SELECT carrier, count(*) AS c2 FROM ontime WHERE YearD=2007 GROUP BY carrier) SELECT t.carrier, c, c2, c*1000/c2 as c3 FROM t JOIN t2 ON (t.Carrier=t2.Carrier) ORDER BY c3 DESC InfoBright: Shell

So result is: [ âEVâ, 101796, 286234, 355 ] [ âUSâ, 135987, 485447, 280 ] [ âAAâ, 176203, 633857, 277 ] [ âMQâ, 145630, 540494, 269 ] [ âASâ, 42830, 160185, 267 ] [ âB6â, 50740, 191450, 265 ] [ âUAâ, 128174, 490002, 261 ] â¦ with execution time: 0.5s for MonetDB and 2.92s for InfoBright.

It seems MonetDB does not like scanning wide range of rows, the slowness here is similar to Q0. -Q8: As final I tested most popular destination in sense count of direct connected cities for different diapason of years. Shell 
SELECT DestCityName, COUNT( DISTINCT OriginCityName) FROM ontime WHERE Year BETWEEN N and M GROUP BY DestCityName ORDER BY 2 DESC LIMIT 10; 1 SELECT DestCityName, COUNT( DISTINCT OriginCityName) FROM ontime WHERE Year BETWEEN N and M GROUP BY DestCityName ORDER BY 2 DESC LIMIT 10; Years, InfoBright, MonetDB 1y, 5.88s, 0.55s 2y, 11.77s, 1.10s 3y, 17.61s, 1.69s 4y, 37.57s, 2.12s 10y, 79.77s, 29.14s UPDATE (5-Oct-2009): James Birchall recommended to use hint COMMENT âlookupâ for fields in InfoBright that have less 10.000 distinct values. I tried that, and it affected only these queries. Results with changes: Years, InfoBright, MonetDB 1y, 1.74s, 0.55s 2y, 3.68s, 1.10s 3y, 5.44s, 1.69s 4y, 7.22s, 2.12s 10y, 17.42s, 29.14s -Q9: And prove that MonetDB does not like to scan many records, there is query Shell

My goal was to check how available OpenSource software is able to handle such kind of tasks. Despite InfoBright was slower for many queries, I think it is more production ready and stable. It has Enterprise edition and Support which you can buy. And execution time is really good, taking into account amount of rows engine had to crunch. For query Q8 (1year range) traditional transactional oriented stored engine took 30min to get result. I really like MonetDB. I do not know what is the magic behind the curtain, they also do not have indexes like InfoBright, but results are impressive. On drawbacks â the command line is weak ( I had to use bash and pass query as parameter, otherwise I was not able to edit query or check history), the documentation also needs improvements. The fact it does not use the compression also maybe showstopper, the space consumption is worrying. Addressing these issues I think MonetDB may have commercial success Worth to note that MonetDB supports all INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE statements (and space is price for that as I understand), while InfoBright ICE edition allows you only LOAD DATA. InfoBright Enterprise allows INSERT / UPDATE but that also is not for online transactions processing. Compression in InfoBright is impressive. Even smaller rate 1:10 means you can compress 1TB to 100GB, which is significant economy of space. I am open to run any other queries if you want to compare or get info about air performance.

This comes from the âfewer knobs to tune is betterâ approach that MonetDB takes. Iâm still trying to understand here why âMonetDB does not like to scan many recordsâ, as it seems to me at first sight that a full scan is made in most queries. Anyhow, if it does a plain full scan, it for sure loses from Infobright which really benefits from their excellent compressed storage in that case. Thanks.

You can also try sphinxsearch (http://www.sphinxsearch.com/) for some of those queries (it can now group by and order by).

I am going to have talk on OpenSQL Camp about this side of Sphinx, I may use this dataset. What would be interesting to see it on multi-cpu box and run Sphinx query in N parallel processes. Reply peter says: October 3, 2009 at 10:30 am Vadim, Couple of questions and notes 1) Did you run query once or several times (so if any self tuning needs to be done it is done) ? 2) Iâm wondering if data set you have was giving undue advantage to MonetDB. I see you have touch may be 1/10 of columns which with 4GB of memory gets close to amount of memory you have. I trust Infobright and compression can cost you when data is in memory but if working set is significantly more than amount of memory things may change. 3) What is about Joins ? So far we have only looked at single table queries which do not stress the optimizer a lot. It would be very interesting to see some more complicated multiple table queries too. 4) What is about MyISAM ? It would be really nice to keep it as a baseline. Reply Vadim says: October 3, 2009 at 1:27 pm Peter, 1) I did run queries in loop until I got stable repeatable number. as 2-4) there indeed much more experiments can be done.

I happen to do some BI/DWH for my job, but our volumes are so modest that I havenât had the need for a special purpose product yet. Iâm just interested and try to keep up with all those developments. Reply James Birchall says: October 5, 2009 at 9:18 am Vadim, Infobright ICE does some serious optimisations on columns if they have less then 10,000 unique entries in the column and if you specify âCOMMENT âlookup'â in the definition (they automatically generate and maintain an ENUM, I think). Think of them like indexes. If you change the definitions for the key columns in the queries, does that change your results at all? Reply Vadim says: October 5, 2009 at 9:27 am James, Thatâs good point, I will try to change column definition for fields affected in queries. Reply David says: October 5, 2009 at 7:41 pm Good post, but why not try to run TPC-H test ? Reply Vadim says: October 5, 2009 at 8:30 pm David, TPC-H is boring and everyone can run it ð Also it uses some unreal data. Database vendors often publish TPC-H by themselves: see e.g. http://www.monetdb.nl/projects/monetdb/SQL/Benchmark/TPCH/index.html. And I know some companies optimizes performance of database especially for TPC-H load ( I do not point here to InfoBright nor MonetDB, I do not have that facts). So better to take some independent and something that is more interesting for me. Reply Vadim says: October 5, 2009 at 8:38 pm James, I did changes you mentioned, it really affected only Q8, but really affected significantly. The execution time for InfoBright now is: 1y: 1.74 s 2y: 3.68 s 3y: 5.44 s 4y: 7.22 s 10y: 17.42 s Reply erin says: October 7, 2009 at 10:41 am Thanks Vadim! I was hoping youâd do something like this! I really appreciate the use of real world data because in my experience random, dummy data without any similarity to real world data just doesnât give realistic info when it comes to large datasets. Iâm using ICE in production & the data compression is impressive (think green! as Brian Aker says). The query performance is impressive. But queries really have to be optimized and that is a challenge without explain. Weâre not using joins (but unlike mysql you can have more columns) and weâre only using INTs, no varchars or date (tho my test with using date resulted in a very very slight increase in load time, not anything noticeable in query time). But if you mess up & run a query with curdate() in it, oh boy is that slow. Then do NOT kill it. Thatâs a bug (reported & they are working on it). Thanks for doing these benchmarks. erin Reply James Birchall says: October 8, 2009 at 3:00 pm Hey Vadim, One more variation for InfoBrightâ¦ You might try using the FlightTime fields instead of the Year, Month, DayOfWeek stuff for your range queries. I found that the Knowledge Grid does some wonderful things with range queries over dates that it didnât do for straight integers (even simple equality). James. Reply John Sichi says: October 11, 2009 at 1:34 pm Hi Vadim, Weâve written up a page with instructions on the LucidDB load (including experimental support for parallel load): http://pub.eigenbase.org/wiki/LucidDbOtp Best results will probably be achieved with one year per INSERT statement (theoretically you could use a massive UNION ALL to do them all at once, but I havenât tested that). Weâre guessing that the performance degradation and eventual failures you hit may have been due to the blanks for number fields (which LucidDB is picky about); the cleansing CASE expressions are supplied to fix those. In case there are other problems, weâve included a section on how to enable row rejection for debugging them. Please let me know if you need any help with getting it working or tuned; weâll be interested to see your results. LucidDB is targeted at complex schemas and queries, but weâd like to know where we stand even on simple table+query environments. Reply Vadim says: October 11, 2009 at 10:20 pm John, Thank you, I will try it in next couple days. Do you have public examples with complex queries and schemas, beside TPC-H ? Thanks, Vadim Reply Carl Gelbart says: October 12, 2009 at 10:51 am ItÃ¢â¬â¢s great to see these independent tests of Infobright Community Edition (ICE) and other open source products. The massive compression you saw is typical of what ICE and IEE (enterprise edition) users see. A couple of comments in regards to Infobright: While we have lots of ICE users with relatively small databases (which we would consider under 200GB), the real power of the product can be seen when the database is considerably larger(hundreds of gigabytes to tens of terabytes.) ThatÃ¢â¬â¢s when the Knowledge Grid advantages really show, as itÃ¢â¬â¢s ability to eliminate the need to access large amounts of data results in great query performance versus other products. Typically we also see that the kinds of queries people run donÃ¢â¬â¢t have a where clause that encompasses half the rows in the databases. How about doing a test against a 500 GB database? Try it with putting in a typical report date range (a month?) and see what kind of results you get. As far as getting access to IEE as mentioned by someone above, a free trial is available via download on the Infobright.com website, or we could send it to you if you want. The compression and query speed will be comparable to ICE, but there are more options for loading data and faster load speed. Carl Gelbart Sr. S.E. Infobright Reply Vadim says: October 12, 2009 at 5:26 pm Carl, Thank you for following our blog. I do not have bigger dataset on the hands that I can publish on public. When I have something interesting I will ask access to IEE. Do you have data that you can share ? Reply John Sichi says: October 12, 2009 at 8:49 pm Vadim, The best examples of high schema and query complexity I know of are locked away inside of the now-defunct LucidEra. CRM analytic schemas there involved numerous fact tables (e.g. leads, opportunities, orders, forecasts, quotas), joining on many conforming dimensions (e.g. time, lead owners, salesreps, territories, campaigns, prospects, customers, opportunity type/status, pricing, partners, discounts, on and onâ¦), and in fact many of the fact and dimension âtablesâ were actually views joining underlying base tables in order to make the warehouse schema accessible via Mondrianâs dimensional model. But if you want to see a reasonable amount of query complexity on a public dataset, use Mondrianâs FOODMART schema with LucidDB: http://pub.eigenbase.org/wiki/LucidDbOlap And then execute MDX queries involving lots of filtered dimensions, and trace the underlying SQL (youâll see a lot of star joins). The data volume is piddling though. For schema complexity, Iâm not aware of any, but if you can find something that already has Mondrian set up with PostgreSQL or MySQL, we have an automated procedure for replicating that into LucidDB: http://pub.eigenbase.org/wiki/LucidDbMondrianReplication Reply Greenplum Single-Node Edition â sometimes free is a real cool price | DBMS2 -- DataBase Management System Services says: October 19, 2009 at 6:25 am [â¦] MySQL Performance blog on MonetDB and Infobright community edition [â¦] Reply Matin Kersten says: October 31, 2009 at 7:17 am Dear Vadim, We appreciate your tryout of the system. We did not found the time yet to load the referenced data and re-run the experiments to shed some light on the questions raised. (Does RITA http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time has a (hidden) textual interface to quickly download the files? Can I download your cvs files?) â we are aware that the documentation can be improved, especially in areas where confusion may arise due to SQL 2003 compliance. â the parallel loading in 5.14 was turned off due to a design error that could materialize in COPY with initial offsets. The November release has it fixed. (on tpch-sf10 loading it is locally 3 x faster then the release you used) â MonetDB does not rely heavily on value compression (the X100 project, now part of VectorWise/Ingres does) MonetDB does, however, use the minimal data types required to store information. â MonetDB automatically builds a dictionary system for strings string heaps = 64KB are opportunistically (imperfect) duplicate eliminated â The growth in database size most likely comes from the logical references (8bytes) into the dictionary(short strings) â Q7 would be a target for us to run with the statement modifiers EXPLAIN (for plan) and TRACE (for detailed performance trace) We would appreciate those for inspection. â same for Q9. Note that MonetDB does not create any a priory (persistent) index, sorting or clustering to answer aggregate queries. Everything is done at runtime and upon need. Including sampling for grouping. I guess that Infobright benefits here from its partitioning information and compression over sorted tables (year). Q3 is an example that highlights the differences in the âroughâ. regards, Martin Kersten The MonetDB Team Reply Matin Kersten says: October 31, 2009 at 7:19 am â MonetDB automatically builds a dictionary system for strings string heaps smaller then 64KB are fully duplicate eliminated string heaps larger then 64KB are opportunistically (imperfect) duplicate eliminated Reply Vadim says: October 31, 2009 at 11:41 am Matin, Thank you for follow up. you can download data by direct links like http://www.transtats.bts.gov/Download/On_Time_On_Time_Performance_1988_1.zip just change year and month in loop.

I did some pre-processing of csv files, i.e. I put all columns into quotes â â. Statement to load data into tables was: /usr/local/monetdb/bin/mclient -lsql âdatabase=ontime -t -s âCOPY 700000 records INTO ontime FROM â/data/d1/AirData_ontime/${YEAR}_$i.txt.cleanâ USING DELIMITERS â,â,â\nâ,â\ââ NULL AS â;â Reply Martin Kersten says: November 1, 2009 at 12:30 pm Dear Vadim et.al. This data warehouse is interesting, as it is one from the âwildâ. The dimension and fact tables have been combined into a single table. Furthermore, the varchar(10) used often in the schema is an overshoot for the actual values stored. I have ran the load and queries on the MonetDB Nov 2009 RC. The results can be seen here http://www.cwi.nl/~mk/ontimeReport The results align with those reported here. However, we may consider reviving an old manual technique applied in an older version of MonetDB, which would bring the storage down to ca 10 GB. regards, Martin Reply Martin Kersten says: November 1, 2009 at 1:06 pm Vadim et.al. (not sure if my earlier message got through, if so ignore this one) I have installed the database and ran the queries against the MonetDB Nov 2009 RC. The results are summarized in http://www.cwi.nl/~mk/ontimeReport. regards, Martin Reply Vadim says: November 2, 2009 at 12:15 pm Martin, I see you have comment about load time and datasize. Is there something I should change to get better results ? Thanks. Vadim Reply Martin Kersten says: November 2, 2009 at 12:46 pm Vadim The load time is with the default loader settings in the Nov 2009 RC. Unlike the Aug 2009 release, it uses all possible threads to act in the loading. Further improvements, which is still possible, would call for more development in the loader algorithms itself. There is still quite some room to improve further, because we have not reached our CPU nor IO capacity limit. The current algorithm properly deals with variable sized input and requests for OFFSET into the input stream. (which may be coming from stdin) For utmost loading speed there is an attachment option, but that is a totally different story and only relevant for dealing with tables of >1TB. The database size was a little surprise. The OnTime table looks like a flattened star-schema. This means we have a lot of small dimension tables, as indicated in the count overview. It would not be a design aimed at scalability. Furthermore, any varchar() object in MonetDB leads to an overhead of 8 bytes, a logical reference from a column to a string area. This hurts if the actual collection of strings only consists of a handful values and we have 120M references. The way to deal with is well known, and the functionality is part of MonetDB4 as ENUM types. We might put a little compression optimizer in the pipeline, that recognizes and handles this case directly and transparently for the user. SQL users would obtain the same result, if they replaced the corresponding columns with a dictionary table and a TINYINT or SMALLINT and relied on the join to couple them. This, however, would not be our preferred way. regards, Martin Reply Vadim says: November 28, 2009 at 4:11 am There is comment from David Lutz, InfoBright: Hello! I have been testing with this data set, as well, thanks to your suggestion. There are many differences in our two environments and I donât want to post the whole test as it would be almost as big as your original post. What I did want to offer is that I performed the test on 10 years of data using the current version of Infobright Enterprise Edition (3.2.2) which has a multi-threaded loader. I loaded different years and my total raw data was only ~27GB in size (~1.5GB compressed). My experience in loading was very consistent for each subsequent year at between 4m12s and 4m20s for each complete year (concatenated the months into a single file) or around 2,560 seconds. The total record count was 70,097,260 records. Another way of saying that would be 273,817 records/second versus your experience of 13,244 records/second (117,023,290 records in 8,836 seconds) with the single-threaded loader provided in Infobright Community Edition, a ~20X improvement (on my server) and using the DDL below. The DDL is the other thing. When appropriate I used the COMMENT âLOOKUPâ attribute offered by Infobright to transparently convert repetitive text strings to internal, integer lookup values. This improves load times, compression on those columns, and query performance when one of these columns is used for filtering, joining or aggretating on. This is apparent in the improvements in response time for several of the queries above. The DDL I used is included below: DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ontime; CREATE TABLE ontime( Year SMALLINT NOT NULL, â 1 Year Quarter TINYINT NOT NULL, â 2 Quarter (1-4) Month TINYINT NOT NULL, â 3 Month DayofMonth TINYINT NOT NULL, â 4 Day of Month DayOfWeek TINYINT NOT NULL, â 5 Day of Week FlightDate DATE NOT NULL, â 6 Flight Date (YYYY-MM-DD) [not (yyyymmdd)] UniqueCarrier CHAR(2) NOT NULL COMMENT âLOOKUPâ, â 7 Unique Carrier Code.

I can see some crash reports in the monetdb forum, but no memory leak report, could you give me some advices? Did you encouter this problem when you run the benchmark? Thanks Reply Vadim says: December 23, 2009 at 11:39 pm Dear Frank, I am not expert in MonetDB, but Martin Kersten is. If he does not notice your question, I will pass it to him. Reply Martin Kersten says: December 24, 2009 at 12:45 am Dear Frank, Sounds as an error I would like to reconfirm (and solve if correct). Can you provide more information on this experiment on the MonetDB usersâ list. monetdb-users@lists.sourceforge.net In particular, version used, platform characteristics, and experiment script. Reply Frank says: December 24, 2009 at 2:27 am Dear Vadim and Martin, Thanks for your quick reply, I have post my experiment to the MonetDB usersâlist. Reply Martin Kersten says: January 1, 2010 at 1:33 pm Dear all, This benchmark was a good exercise to re-prioritize some of our development efforts towards improvements for daily BI use. Although the original results were quite promising, we knew that low hanging fruit in the MonetDB stack was not harvested. A peek preview on the performance results for the next feature release can be found in http://www.cwi.nl/~mk/ontimeReport Happy newyear. Martin Reply Vadim says: January 1, 2010 at 10:06 pm Martin, Thatâs impressive. I canât recall so fast response with performance fixes with significant improvements. Is that version available to download ? Reply Vlad Rodionov says: February 2, 2010 at 5:47 pm First of all, I would like to thank Vadim and mysqlperformanceblog team for very interesting posts â I am a regular visitor of your web-site. In our company we are looking for D/W solution which will allow us to do a real-time (10-15 sec) queries on 1B+ row tables. InfoBright, MonetDB, InfiniDB are in my short lists. Having read your article first time I was impressed by performance numbers of columnar databases, but now â¦ I think that there are a lot of room for query optimization inside both MonetDB and Infobright. For example, this query takes 7.9 sec for MonetDB and 12 sec for Infobright. -Q1: Count flights per day from 2000 to 2008 years SELECT DayOfWeek, count(*) AS c FROM ontime WHERE YearD BETWEEN 2000 AND 2008 GROUP BY DayOfWeek ORDER BY c DESC This is a full column scan query. Group BY column has very low cardinality (7) => do grouping and aggregation in memory. DayOfWeek requires only 3 bits per row => for 117M row table, it will need ~30Mb to store the whole column. Loading column from disk (30MB), decompressing it and aggregating 117M numbers should not take more than 1 sec (actually, I think I can do it on my laptop in less than 0.5 sec). Vadim, can you forward my e-mail address and question to MonetDB and Infobright guys? This is query: SELECT T.C FROM T WHERE (up to 4 simple filter conditions ANDed) ORDER BY T.B DESC LIMIT N; The good selectivity is not guaranteed. It may require almost full table scan in a worst case. Can they do this type of query under 15 sec in a worst case on 1B table which is similar to the table from this post (120 columns â most of them with low cardinality â no strings only numbers) Reply Vlad Rodionov says: February 2, 2010 at 6:02 pm Forgot to mention YearD column in my example. Of course we need to scan through 2 columns, but both are with very low cardinality and must be very compressible ones. The second column will add possibly 60Mb more data to load from disk. Reply Vadim says: February 2, 2010 at 9:56 pm Vlad, I forwarded your question to my contacts in MonetDB and InfoBright. Reply Martin Kersten says: February 5, 2010 at 3:05 pm Dear Vlad, Sorry for the delay in answering your question regarding Q1 and compression. Bit-wise compression is a two-edge sword. You save on IO and pay with CPU cycles. The numbers reported for both MonetDB and Infobright on this blog already show that compression is just one ingredient in the equation. MonetDB used more diskspace and still performed very well. In http://homepages.cwi.nl/~mk/ontimeReport you find more recent numbers. In particular, Q1 runs currently within 1 sec on the 118M tuples. It is certainly worth trying out the 1B version using the upcoming Feb2010 release. Reply Vlad Rodionov says: February 5, 2010 at 3:35 pm Thanks, Martin I will definitely give MonetDB a try. Reply itsme says: October 27, 2015 at 2:33 am hi Vadim, whatâs king of software are you using to make picture graph ? thanks in advance ð Reply Eyal Rozenberg says: October 30, 2016 at 9:12 am For anyone whoâs interested in this data and/or in these queries as a benchmark, Iâve created a github repository: https://github.com/eyalroz/usdt-ontime-tools for automating the download of the CSVs and the loading of the data â at least into MonetDB. The numbers have changed significantly since 2009 â but there are also schema changes because of what BTS provides; some make the schema âtighterâ â e.g. the fact that the decimal values are not really decimal, they always end with .00 and are really ints, so my loading script cleans them up; but on the other hand, you canât rely on having exactly 6 chars in the tailnum, and sometimes itâs even missing entirely. Iâll be using this to try out some GPU decompression primitives. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Subscribe Want to get weekly updates listing the latest blog posts?

The company held an event Oct. 26, where it showcased devices such as the Surface Studio and Surface Book i7, but the Surface Pro 5 tablet was a no-show. The device is rumored to launch in spring 2017, after the Windows 10 Creators Update rolls out for existing devices. Will it replicate the success of the Surface Pro 4 for Microsoft? Will it have standout features similar to the recently launched devices? Well, it remains to be seen. Until Microsoft makes official announcements about what the Surface Pro 5 will have, here are some rumors and speculations about what the device may offer. Display Surface Pro 5 might feature a 4K/UHD display having a 3860 x 2560p display with the same 3:2 aspect ratio that Microsoft has been using since the Surface Pro 3. The existing model - the Surface Pro 4, comes with a 2736 x 1824p IPS LCD display with a pixel density of 267 ppi. A 4K display may cause a significant price bump and also eat into the battery life, so this feature might be limited to a top-end version of the device rather than coming on the standard Surface Pro devices. Processor Surface Pro 4 came with a Skylake processor inside, but the most popular rumor about the upcoming device is that it might come with the new Intel Kaby Lake Processors. The new processors have faster clock speed changes due to a 14 nanometer device architecture. The processor series is expected to offer better graphics support for devices. It is also notable that Intel is currently working on Cannonlake chips, but Kabylake is the one that Surface Pro 5 is expected to come with as Cannonlake might not ship before 2017. Stylus Support Stylus support is one of the standout features of the Surface Pro, so much so, that even competitor Apple decided to ship its iPad Pro with one. Microsoft's Stylus, called the Surface Pen, launched with the original Surface Pro and has been available with each upcoming model since 2012. The new Surface Pen is expected to be more pressure sensitive than the current one. USB-C support Microsoft might finally add USB-C support to the Surface Pro series, beginning with Surface Pro 5. Related Stories Microsoft Going Big With Next Surface Pro Rumors Reveal New Details About Microsoft's New All-In-Ones And Surface Book 2 USB-C is becoming the universal standard for many devices, including the ones recently launched from Google and Apple. As more accessories get designed to work with USB-C, the company is expected to endow its upcoming tablet with a relevant port. Multiple device connection capability It is expected that Surface Pro 5 will allow multi-device usage seamlessly. Users might be able to connect other Windows 10 devices with it and work across devices easily. They could pick up work they have done on the Surface Pro 5 and continue it on another device. A patent filed Jun. 26 by Microsoft explains how users could access the keyboard, mouse, memory and OS from connected devices. The company already has a PC-smartphone connected device, the Continuum. If Surface Pro 5 comes with the same feature, it could get a leg up on competitors such as the Apple iPad Air 2.

Apple going all-in on USB-C for MacBooks is great for the future, but leaves us in dongle hell for now CNET 10/30/2016 Dong Ngo Â© Provided by CNET Josh Miller/CNET Editorâs note: The opinions in this article are the authorâs, as published by our content partner, and do not represent the views of MSN or Microsoft. Popular Searches Audi AG AUDVF â¼ 656.20 -11.30 -1.69% Dick's Sporting Goods Inc DKS â¼ 56.71 -4.18 -6.86% International Business Machines Corp IBM â² 158.67 +0.46 +0.29% Aptose Biosciences Inc APTO â² 0.9300 +0.0300 +3.33% Someday we'll live in a truly wireless future, where everything is interconnected. Speeds will be so fast -- 5G and WiGig -- and the chipsets so cheap and plentiful that everything from your coffee maker to your garage door opener will have them embedded by default. Even your charging cable may go away, when and if we ever get a single wireless charging standard. In the meantime: you've got cables and wires. Lots of them. And they all probably fit into a different-shaped port. That's the world that Apple's new MacBook Pros are coming into. Ironically, after pulling the headphone jack from its iPhone 7, Apple left it in its new laptops. But aside from that old-fashioned 3.5mm jack, the only connector you'll find on Apple's latest and greatest laptops is USB-C. Depending on which model you choose, you get two or four of the tiny ports, all of which offer the Thunderbolt 3 bandwidth and connectivity. Apple's full-on embrace of Thunderbolt 3 is great. Thunderbolt 3 is extremely fast and versatile and really is the connection port of the future. On the other hand, we're still living in a present where port standards like HDMI, the SD card slot, and especially regular old USB-A ports -- those rectangular ones that have been around for 20 years or so -- are still widely used by the vast majority of devices. Which means, buying a MacBook Pro right now is to invest in a variety of adapters for all your legacy devices. But before we delve too deeply into the cons, let's take a closer look at the pros of this decision. One port, one cable for everything Last year Intel announced that Thunderbolt 3 would use the same port type as USB-C. Meaning that depending on the type of device connected to it, every Thunderbolt 3 port will also work as a USB-C port and every Thunderbolt 3 cable will work as a USB-C cable and vice versa (as long as you get a qualitative USB-C cable.) When working as Thunderbolt 3, the port delivers up to 40Gbps bandwidth and as USB-C, up to 10Gbps. Both types of connections allow for the delivery of data, audio and video, making it by far the fastest and most flexible peripheral port to date. Plug in a Thunderbolt 3 device to a new MacBook, and file transfer speeds will be so quick that the write speed of the storage will be the only thing holding you back. And with the right adapter, you can output video to HDMI, VGA, DVI, DisplayPort or pretty much anything else under the sun. It's also important to note that USB-C supports bidirectional charging. This means not only can you now can say goodbye the the MagSafe charging adapter on the new MacBooks, you can also use the laptop to charge any peripheral device connected to it or use a peripheral device to charge the laptop. So you really only need one power adapter, no matter how many devices you use with your laptop, including those that would normally require a separate power source, which is awesome. When Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C are the only port types used in peripheral devices, you won't need to carry more than one type of cable with you. Just a few USB-C cables will connect everything. Just think about how convenient it is! Dongle and accessory madness But that future is still quite far away; for now, there are myriad peripheral devices that still require the USB-A connector (legacy standard USB), like portable drives, SD card readers, most smartphones and so on. This means you'll need to get an accessory or dongle adapter before you can use them. If the new laptops retained just one regular USB type-A port, this wouldn't be such a big deal and would greatly ease the pain of the transition. Keep in mind that this is the first time the MacBook Pro has gotten USB-C; prior to this the 12-inch MacBook was the only Apple computer that used USB-C. Apple's fastest growing product category. pic.twitter.com/d1sel4N5Ycâ Drew Breunig (@dbreunig) October 28, 2016 And the number of ports itself is also significant. Even in the case of the Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pro models (13- and 15-inch), the ones with 4 Thunderbolt/USB-C ports, that's still not enough ports to comfortably suit many people's needs. Just look at your computer right now and count how many things are currently plugged in. (And remember: there's no more MagSafe port, either; if you want to charge your new MacBook, a USB-C power cable will occupy one of those precious ports.) For me personally: a charging cable, a portable backup drive, a smartphone, an SD card, and a thumbdrive, and at times an external monitor. And while the new MacBooks compare pretty favorably to the MacBook Air (two USB, a Thunderbolt 2 port for external video, plus MagSafe charging, and 3.5mm headphone), they're a far cry from the previous (albeit still available) MacBook Pro 15-inch, which has a total of 7 ports (two USB, two Thunderbolt 2, HDMI, SD, MagSafe and headphone). For power users -- the very folks looking for a "Pro" laptop -- that's already limiting. The iPhone paradox However, it's iPhone users who'll suffer most. When the iPhone 7 was first announced, I was extremely disappointed by its lack of USB-C support -- Apple still opted to use its proprietary Lightning connector instead. And now this means that you can't connect the phone to any of the new MacBook Pros, without an adapter. You could skip the adapter and get Apple's Lightning to USB-C cable for $25. That will solve the connection problem, but then you'll need to carry at least two types of cables when traveling. So much for the future where only a single type of cable is necessary. (Apple didn't immediately reply to my request for comment on why it had made this decision.) This whole ordeal is rife with irony. With its computers, Apple is now one of the biggest supporters of USB-C. But at the same time, it bars its flagship smartphone from natively using this port, which just doesn't make sense to me. But even taking the iPhone out of the equation, the abrupt move -- from no USB-C on the MacBook Pros at all to going all USB-C and nothing else -- feels premature. Apple is treating a relatively distant future as if it were already here. And as a result it may have taken its shot way too soon.

TRENDING NOW: Watch Dogs 2 first impressions Home Reviews Cases, Cooling & PSU CPU Air Coolers Cooler Master MASTERAIR PRO 3 CPU Cooler Review Cooler Master's MASTERAIR PRO 3 CPU cooler is the first product to go under testing on our new cooler rig setup. So, let's see how it does. By: Chad Sebring | CPU Air Coolers in Cases, Cooling & PSU | Posted: Oct 30, 2016 4:00 am Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA TweakTown Rating: 93%Manufacturer: Cooler Master Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 2 [Packaging] Page 3 [Cooler Master MASTERAIR PRO 3 CPU Cooler] Page 4 [Accessories and Documentation] Page 5 [Installation and Finished Product] Page 6 [Test System Setup, Thermal Tests, and Noise Results] Page 7 [Final Thoughts] Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing Â  Â  When it comes to the MASTERAIR series of coolers, up until this point, all we have for reference is the MASTERAIR Maker 8 CPU cooler from Cooler Master. This does not stop them from developing more coolers in this lineup, however, and is why we have you attention here today. However, where the Maker 8 has all of the bells and whistles for a single tower cooler, including dual fans, shrouds, LED lighting, plus the ability to have some of its parts replaced with 3D printed products, what has come forth since, is a bit more mundane. Â  Â  This is not to say the last two coolers to sport the MASTERAIR naming are in any way sub par; they are just more economically friendly designs. For those who did not want to spend large on the MASTERAIR Maker 8 now have the option to select something which does not require you to dig as deep into your wallet. At the same time, they offer many features that make newer coolers a success in today's market. While these coolers may not be as fancy as the original, they offer things like an offset design to allow clearance around the socket, easy to use mounting hardware, and a clip on fan which makes changing the fans or cleaning them much easier. Â  Today we start with the smaller of the two options to be released. Cooler Master is setting forth a pair of new options in the MASTERAIR series, and we are covering the MASTERAIR PRO 3 here. This is a 92mm fan based cooler which sports a few new features as well as being capable of being installed in places where the standard 120mm fan cooler solutions will not fit. With our new test system all set and ready to go, we bring forth the first new cooler to be tested with it. Hopefully, by the time we are done with this review, you will have some appreciation for this very affordable air cooler from Cooler Master, and if space is of any concern to you, this may just be a solid solution to suit your needs as well. Â  Â  We copied this chart from the packaging on the MASTERAIR PRO 3 as it has yet to be released at the time we are writing this review. On the packaging, we see things start off with a full list of compatibility for both Intel and AMD, which covers all of the Intel line and most of the AMD sockets as well. The MASTERAIR PRO 3, all told, stands 140mm tall, it is 117mm wide, and is just 78mm in depth, with the fan incorporated in these measurements. As far as materials are concerned, there are three copper heat pipes which are 6mm in diameter, there is aluminum with exposed copper heat pipes in the CDC 2.0 base design, and of course, this cooler uses aluminum for the 41 fins including the top fin which has been anodized black. Â  The fan which is included with the MASTERAIR PRO 3 is a 92mm fan sporting the FD09225M12LPC model number, and it includes a switch that can be set to silent or quiet modes. The speed of this fan ranges from 650 to 3000 RPM, and it can deliver 28 CFM of air flow and 2.5 mmH2O of pressure at its maximum speed. With light use of this fan, you can expect a lifetime of 350,000 hours, but if left at its maximum speed, the lifespan is reduced to just 50,000 hours. This 92mm fan is rated to deliver a range of noise from 6 dBA on the low-end to a maximum of 30dBA. It is a 4-pin PWM powered fan which can draw 12V but sips power with just 0.1 A of power draw, using 1.2W. All told, this cooler weighs in at 503.5 grams with the fan included, but what is refreshing is that this MASTERAIR PRO 3 ships with a five-year warranty to cover it. Â  As we write this review, the MASTERAIR PRO 3 is not yet available at any retail locations. In various emails that came along with our agreement for a launch day review, we have the MSRP information. We are told that to obtain this smaller single tower air cooler, you will only need to come up with $39.99 to get one shipped to your door. It is rare that we run across coolers which cost less than $50, but the MASTERAIR PRO 3 from Cooler Master is such a cooler. With an affordable price point, the newly designed Continuous Direct Contact 2.0 base design offering 45 percent more contact with the CPU, things are looking up for this cooler. Â  Stick with us as we get a good look at what Cooler Master is offering with the MASTERAIR PRO 3, and as we complete the testing, we will deliver our verdict on whether or not this compact single tower design is something that is worthy of your attention, and something you just cannot live without.

Deze crossplatform-mediacentersoftware wordt ontwikkeld voor Windows, macOS, Linux, Android en iOS. In versieÂ 17.0 is de mogelijkheid voor het afspelen van 10bit- en hevc-materiaal toegevoegd, in combinatie met gpu's van Intel of Nvidia die daar ondersteuning voor bieden. Ook de standaard-skin is gewijzigd naar Estuary en voor apparaten met een aanraakscherm is dat Estouchy geworden. De belangrijkste veranderingen die in bÃ¨ta 5 zijn doorgevoerd zijn hieronder voor je samengevat. Fixes done in this Beta 5: Fix playback of HLS streams Fix skin settings not loading when âreload skinâ was triggered Fix segfault on EOF for video caused by postprocessing Fix possible crash on Android when other Android apps had missing icons Change splash screen text once per second to show itâs busy doing database and add-on upgrades instead of just static text. Fix missing binary add-ons like PVR and controller handling on Windows Add back seek to time using numeric input on video files Microsoft has rolled out a fix for users of the Kodi UWP version in combination with AMD videocard that had BSOD. For more information see: Blue screen with error code 0x139 Known problems Upgrading the skin you are currently using fails on Windows. Upgrading any add-on currently fails on Windows. Possible video freezes on Raspberry Pi and Android. We are trying to find the cause solve these problems. Of course there are some more however these are the most noticeable ones. Remember this is still Beta software so please be patient.

Auto-updates en een mooie LiveTile in je Startscherm. Ik hoop dat veel applicaties snel volgen. Ik denk ook dat des te meer applicaties als UWP versie verschijnen, des te stabieler Windows gaat worden op den duur. Omdat de apps in een sandbox draaien, automatisch updaten en niet meer de centrale registry gebruiken. Met 1 klik installeren en met 1 klik de-installeren zonder dat er troep achterblijft. Ik zeg, kom maar door - Filezilla - CCleaner - uTorrent - Spotify - MPC-HC - WhatsApp - Firefox etc. etc. etc. Reageer -1 johnkeates @LCP â¢ 30 oktober 2016 03:05 +1 Michaelr1 @johnkeates â¢ 30 oktober 2016 06:07 Miljoenen mensen die windows gebruiken en dan denk je dat er amper iemand tussen zit die Kodi gebruikt? Reageer +1 Blackbird-ce @Michaelr1 â¢ 30 oktober 2016 09:00 Eigenlijk wel... vroeger had iedereen ook ICQ, MSN, Trillian, ets geÃ¯nstalleerd op z'n Windows-machine, maar dergelijke IM-toepassingen zijn toch redelijk ver verschoven naar mobile devices. @johnkeates verwijst (denk ik) voornamelijk naar het draaien van Kodi op Raspberries en vergelijkbare apparatuur. Reageer +1 Michaelr1 @Blackbird-ce â¢ 30 oktober 2016 09:39 Raspberry Pi's worden extreem veel gebruikt, maar het is voor de gemiddelde persoon nog lang niet weggelegd. Ik ken nog zat mensen (zelfs in de IT!) die een raspberry niet aandurven maar wel Kodi op hun Windows PC draaien. Zelfs IT'ers die Kodi niet aandurven... Voor mij is het allemaal heel erg normaal, zou me het ook amper kunnen voorstellen als ik die mensen niet kende Reageer 0 robbinwehl @Michaelr1 â¢ 31 oktober 2016 08:30 IT'ers die een raspberry niet aandurven ? Elke mbo niveau 2 it'er zal toch een image op een sd moeten kunnen flashen. Reageer 0 Djerro123 @Michaelr1 â¢ 30 oktober 2016 08:54 Zeg maar rustig miljarden mensen.. Reageer +1 Nelissuh @johnkeates â¢ 30 oktober 2016 09:54 Zeker wel, ik draai Kodi onder Windows, op mijn HTPC in de woonkamer tenminste. Maar ook op een Pi op mijn slaapkamer, en ook op verschillende Android apparaten. Allemaal met bestanden en een database die centraal op een NAS staat, incl. DVB-C op alle apparaten beschikbaar met gedeelde PVR opslag (TvHeadend). Werkt perfect. Reageer 0 JUST_me @johnkeates â¢ 30 oktober 2016 22:53 Super chill, een HTPC met hoge kwaliteit audio kaart met Kodi op mijn high end surround set. Prachtige beeld en geluidskwaliteit. Kodi is zeer veel verbeterd afgelopen jaren op voornamelijk audio gebied. Daarnaast, op mijn Surface pro 4 is Kodi ook een van de meest gebruikte programma's. Prima combi, Windows en Kodi. Reageer 0 JerX @johnkeates â¢ 31 oktober 2016 13:27 Ik gebruik Kodi met Windows 10 als HTPC. Hier doe ik ook op browsen en zo nu en dan een spelletje. Gebruik voor de rest thuis ook geen Linux, maar alleen Windows. Overigens heb ik geen zin om Linux uit te leggen bij het vrouwtje, dus dit werkt prima. Ik weet overigens niet of Linux om kan gaan met een Bluray speler, maar mijn Windows gelukkig wel [Reactie gewijzigd door JerX op 31 oktober 2016 13:28] Reageer 0 LCP @johnkeates â¢ 31 oktober 2016 17:40 En jij denkt niet dat mensen op hun desktop computer Kodi gebruiken zeker? Ik dus wel. Sterker nog, ik heb Kodi draaien op een Raspberry pi 1, 2 Ã©n mijn Windows desktop. Allemaal aan elkaar geknoopt via een MySQL database die draait op mijn Netgear NAS. Als ik boven op mijn computer even een serietje wil kijken, dan kan dat dus en wordt de watched status meteen aangepast in de database. Dus. Reageer 0 rootrulez @LCP â¢ 31 oktober 2016 23:05 Waarom geen Plex gebruiken als ik vragen mag? Plex, tov Kodi, is juist bedoeld gebruik te maken van een centrale mediaserver/database waaraan je meerdere players knoopt. Ideaal icm Rasplex op de Pi, iOS devices, android devices, etc, etc. Reageer +1 Pepsichoco 30 oktober 2016 08:45 Kan iemand me eens uitleggen wat dat '10 bit' betekend ? Want ik zou denken dat video gewoon video en audio gewoon audio is. Het verschil tussen mono, stereo en 5.1/7.1 begrijp ik wel, maar is er iets wat er dan aan het beeld veranderd ? Sorry voor de misschien domme vraag voor sommigen, maar ik weet al langer dat er hier slimme mensen op tweakers zitten die het hier wel kunnen uitleggen. Bedankt alvast. Iedereen bedankt, het is me helemaal duidelijk geworden. [Reactie gewijzigd door Pepsichoco op 30 oktober 2016 15:01] Reageer +2 riesm @Pepsichoco â¢ 30 oktober 2016 09:39 Kort door de bocht komt het op het volgende neer. Huidige tv's laten per primaire kleur 256 mogelijkheden toe (8 bits). Met 10 bits wordt dat verhoogd naar 1024 schakeringen per kleur. Op zich lijkt 256 al veel; als je ze echter naast elkaar zet (uiterst links komt waarde 0 en uiterst rechts waarde 255 met daartussen in de schakeringen), zal je zien dat dit op kleine schermen prima resultaat geeft. Op grote schermen zullen de overgangen van deze schakeringen steeds beter zichtbaar worden. Daar zit de winst naar 10-bit. Voorbeeld: http://forum.videohelp.co...hmentid=3774&d=1286525638 Overigens worden de meeste films met 12-bit opgenomen, dus vermoedelijk krijgen we in de nabije toekomst een nieuwe hype: 12-bit kleur. Reageer +1 Nelissuh @Pepsichoco â¢ 30 oktober 2016 09:39 Beelschermen gebruiken 3 kleuren. RGB = Rood Groen en Blauw Standaard kleur op PC / TV = 8 bit = 28 kleuren = 256 kleurschakeringen per kanaal. 3 kanalen (Rood / Groen / Blauw) = 256 x 256 x 256 = 16,7 miljoen kleuren. Dat lijkt heel veel, maar als je alleen een blauwe lucht weer geeft, zijn er maar 256 tinten mogelijk, en kan je de overgangen tussen de kleuren zien (banding). 10 bit = 210 = 1024 kleurschakeringen per kanaal. dus van 8 -> 10 bit is in praktijk dus 4x zo veel kleurtinten per kanaal. Dit wordt vooral belangrijk bij HDR weergave. Bij HDR gaan de maxima van het kleurbereik per kanaal verder uit elkaar. Het meest maximale blauw wordt veel blauwer. Als je dit grotere gebied met 8 bit in 256 stappen blijft delen wordt het banding probleem nog veel groter. 10 bit lost dit probleem dan op. Reageer +1 CH40S Design en multimedia @Pepsichoco â¢ 30 oktober 2016 09:44 Kort door de bocht; gaat om bits per kleur. Meer info, kun je vast wel Googlen. Je krijgt hierdoor meer kleurvarianten, doordat je de info opslaat in 10 bits ipv 8. https://youtu.be/Jcgg7jq1W3o https://youtu.be/bKjSox0uwnk [Reactie gewijzigd door CH40S op 30 oktober 2016 09:50] Reageer +1 Yarisken 29 oktober 2016 18:41 Hoeveel beta's gaan er nog komen :-). Kan echt niet wennen aan de nieuwe skin. Soit is een topproduct, ik zou niet meer zonder kodi kunnen. Staat hier elke avond op. Reageer +1 t0mt0m18 @Yarisken â¢ 29 oktober 2016 21:56 @ Yarisken Maar is het dan niet vervelend dat je steeds weer je add-ons moet bijwerken enzo? Ik heb de afgelopen dagen een beetje geÃ«xperimenteerd met Kodi, maar steeds als ik dan goede kanalen gevonden had waren die een dag later weer weg. Het kan nooit echt een betrouwbare mediaspeler worden op die manier toch? Althans, niet wanneer je ook live-streams en kanalen wilt kunnen ontvangen. Reageer +1 Yarisken @t0mt0m18 â¢ 29 oktober 2016 22:55 Je hebt add-ons die al een tijd meegaan en die redelijk goed werken. Een voorbeeld. Mijn vrouw kijkt een serie op netflix en er staan 2 seizoenen op. Ze wil graag seizoen 3 zien. Dan schakel ik een add-on van kodi in. Met open-subtitles en een goeie add-on lukt dit perfect. Deze add-on worden gemaakt door liefhebbers dus als die ermee stoppen is het ook gedaan. Deze streams zijn dan ook illegaal evenals de add-on :-). Via "legale" add-ons in kodi kijk ik naar de video's van tweakers, dumpert, deredactie.be ( vlaamse tv zender ) etc... . Ik heb ook iptv dat ik bekijk via kodi. dik 2000+ kanalen van over heel de wereld ( betalend ). Earthcam is ook een leuke met cams van over heel de wereld. Reageer +1 Michaelr1 @t0mt0m18 â¢ 30 oktober 2016 06:12 Daar is volgens mij Kodi niet voor bedoeld. Het is en blijft een mediaspeler en bibliotheek. De add-ons (subtitle/library add-ons niet meegerekend) zijn leuk, maar de reden van het succes van XBMC/Kodi ligt bij het customizen, hoge mate van compatibility en verkrijgbaarheid op alle denkbare platformen. Betrouwbaarder dan Kodi wordt het wat mij betreft niet. Alleen VLC heeft hogere compatibility.

Het kan nooit echt een betrouwbare mediaspeler worden op die manier toch? Althans, niet wanneer je ook live-streams en kanalen wilt kunnen ontvangen.Het probleem is daar altijd met niet legale content. Dat kan van dag tot dag verdwijnen. De mediaspeler op zich werkt altijd, de basis addons ( ondertitels en informatie) updaten zichzelf op de achtergrond, daar is niets lastig aan. Reageer +1 Klojum @Yarisken â¢ 29 oktober 2016 18:52 Zoveel betas als dat er nodig zijn, zolang de developers te kort door de bocht willen zoals deze keer. Je kunt in Kodi Krypton ook de Confluence skin installeren (of Xonfluence, met meer mogelijkheden) als je Estuary niks vindt. Reageer +1 Idiocracy @Klojum â¢ 29 oktober 2016 21:36 Het is helemaal niet kort door de bocht gaan. De source code is gewoon spaghetti van oudsher en soms komt er gewoon wat onverwachts boven. Reageer +1 Dima_2005 @Yarisken â¢ 29 oktober 2016 18:48 Ik vind de nieuwe skin net top.

Redelijk ouwbolig tov van wat plex, infuse etc tegenwoodig brengt. Reageer +1 ninjazx9r98 @Nikvdw â¢ 30 oktober 2016 07:45 Dat is een kwestie van smaak en de skin van Kodi is wat mij betreft top (de voorgaande overigens ook) Oubollig en dergelijke boeit me niet zo veel, voor mij moet een skin vooral functioneel zijn en de rest is leuk maar meer ook niet. Plex heeft wat mij betreft overigens een draak van een interface (heel Plex is wat mij betreft een draak en overrated maar dat is een persoonlijke mening) en voor wat betreft oubollig zie ik niet direct wat daar nu zoveel beter/mooier aan is dan Kodi. Reageer +1 Nikvdw @ninjazx9r98 â¢ 30 oktober 2016 09:01 Wat moet een media app meer doen dan content tonen en afspelen? kodi doet dat perfect, maar DS video en Plex doen het gewoon veel mooier (op de apple tv 4). Maar plex is geen optie voor mij omwille van de transcoding op mjn nas. Reageer +1 ninjazx9r98 @Nikvdw â¢ 30 oktober 2016 10:04 Kodi draait op onze HTPC die met HDMI aan de receiver geknoopt is en ik zou werkelijk niet weten wat DS video en Plex daar mooier of beter aan (kunnen) doen? Overigens maakte jij de opmerking dat Kodi anno 2016 een fail is met een oubollige interface wat ik dan weer niet kan plaatsen bij je vraag wat een media app meer moet doen dan content tonen en afspelen. Reageer +1 Nikvdw @ninjazx9r98 â¢ 30 oktober 2016 10:25 Ik heb ook jaren een htpc gehad met kodi. Niks verkeerd mee...toen. Nu gebruik ik een atv4 die gewoon alles voor zijn rekening neemt: eigen content (via kodi/ds video/infuse/plex), netflix, apps, games,... etc. In in deze setup (dus spreek ik voor mijn eigen situatie) is de kodi interface de vreemde eend in de bijt (ouboullig dus..) + de navigatie met de apple remote is bagger (tov native apps). Hopelijk gaat de nieuwe TV app die deze week is voorgesteld ooit kodi (of andere) ondersteunen. 1 (native) app voor all je content . Reageer +1 Mars Warrior @Nikvdw â¢ 29 oktober 2016 21:12 Nu je Infuse neomt: sinds deze uit is gebruik ik heel Kodi niet meer. Behalve de fijne skin is voor mij de eenvoud van configuratie tov Kodi de belangrijste redenen voor deze overstap. Natuurlijk kan Kodi veel mee dan Infuse, maar ik gebruikte Kodi enkel voor het afspelen van films. Reageer +1 ASS-Ware @Nikvdw â¢ 29 oktober 2016 22:28 Kodi altijd top gevonden maat de nieuwe skin is echt wel een fail ano 2016. Redelijk ouwbolig tov van wat plex, infuse etc tegenwoodig brengt.Je kan het oubollig noemen, maar dat kun je toch oplossen door een andere skin te gebruiken? Bovendien, Kodi kan een ISO openen en direct afspelen, kan Plex dat ook? Reageer 0 Nikvdw @ASS-Ware â¢ 30 oktober 2016 08:58 Tbh, er zit niet veel deftig tussen. Daarbij ik gebruik MrMc op de ATV4 en daar valt het gewoon uit de toon en de ondersteuning voor de remote is ook maar bagger. Dus ik gebruik meer en meer DS Video van men NAS.

I also want to thank CSIS for hosting this important conference, and I want to commend my Deputy Secretary of Defense â Bob â and General Paul Selva â guys, thanks for holding the fort down last week â for their leadership and hard work in leading the technology investment thrusts we call the Third Offset Strategy.Â  Iâll speak about that, but of course, in this speech I also want to speak about about innovation in all its dimensions â of which technological innovation is a piece, a very important piece.Â  Because being more innovative in every way we can is critical to the future success of our military and our Defense Department. Today, we have the finest fighting force the world has ever known.Â  Thereâs no other military thatâs stronger, more capable, more experienced, or frankly, more innovative. Â Thatâs why our military edge is second-to-none.Â  And itâs a fact every American ought to be proud of.Â  But itâs also a fact that our militaryâs excellence isnât a birthright.Â  Itâs not guaranteed.Â  And we canât take it for granted in the 21st century â we have to earn it again and again.Â  And thatâs what this is all about:Â  innovating to stay the best.Â  And I want to talk to you today about how weâre doing that in some different areas â our technology, our operations, our organization, and above all, our people. And right now itâs imperative we do so, because we live in a relentlessly changing, and fiercely competitive world.Â  Thereâs the faster pace of change, which sets up a fierce competition between the present and the future; competition with other nations, not only with us, but also with each other; and competition with terrorists and other malefactors for whom we are the game to beat â if they can â even if only in one place and at one time. Technology is one example of such change and competition that many of us have long been familiar with.Â  When I began my own career in physics decades ago, most technology of consequence originated in America, and much of that was sponsored by government, especially the Department of Defense.Â  Today, weâre still major sponsors, but much more technology is commercial.Â  The technology base is global.Â  And other countries have been trying to catch up with the breakthroughs that for the last several decades made our military more advanced than any other. Â And much of the frontier of innovation is commercial, leading to additional sources of competitive dynamism outside our five walls. Against this background, your Defense Department is confronting a world security environment thatâs also dramatically different than the last generation, and even the generation before that.Â  Indeed, the U.S. military is at this moment addressing five major, unique, and rapidly evolving challenges.Â  Weâre countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe.Â  Weâre managing historic change in the Asia-Pacific â the single most consequential region for Americaâs future.Â  Weâre strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Koreaâs continued nuclear and missile provocations.Â  Weâre checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf, and protecting our friends and allies in the Middle East.Â  Weâre accelerating the certain and lasting defeat of ISIL â destroying it in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and everywhere else it metastasizes around the world, even as we help protect our homeland and our people.Â  And at the same time as all of this, weâre preparing to contend with an uncertain future â ensuring that we continue to be ready for challenges we may not anticipate today. We donât have the luxury of choosing between these challenges â we have to do them all.Â  And as the world changes and complexity increases, weâll have to change, too â how to invest, how we fight, how we operate as an organization, and how we attract and nourish talent. As we do, we have to be able to move fast, because the advantages we expect to derive from each innovative cycle today will not last as long as they used to.Â  All the commercial and global change thatâs occurred across the technology landscape has made repeated and rapid cycles necessary, and made high-end tech a lot more accessible to competitors.Â  Think about it.Â  While the Cold War arms race was characterized by the inexorable but steady accumulation of strength â with the leader simply having more, bigger, or better weapons â todayâs era of military competition is characterized by the additional variables of speed and agility, such that leading the race now frequently depends on who can out-innovate faster than everyone else, and even change the game.Â  In the area of investment, itâs no longer just a matter of what we buy. Â Now more than ever, what also matters is how we buy things, how quickly we buy things, whom we buy them from, and how rapidly and creatively we can adapt them and use them in different and innovative ways â all this to stay ahead of future threats and future enemies technologically. Thatâs why Iâve been so intent as Secretary of Defense not only to plant the seeds for a number of different technologies that we think will be determinative in giving us a warfighting advantage for the future â more on those in a moment â but also to be more innovative and agile in all aspects of DoD:Â  in our operations, in our organization, and in the talent management of our all-volunteer forces. In each of these four areas, I â along with the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Service Chiefs, all our excellent Combatant Commanders, and the Defense Departmentâs civilian leadership â have had a lot of help.Â  Weâve had help from Washington think tanks like CSIS, from our defense labs and industry partners, and also from many innovative Americans who understand the innovation imperative and who arenât in our community now, but understand the need for our mission of national security and want to help.Â  And all of us have been pushing the Pentagon to think outside our five-sided box and invest aggressively in innovation. And I want to focus on that in the rest of my remarks â the clear strategic imperative we have to innovate in each area, how weâve been innovating so far, and how we need to innovate going forward. Given the topic of this particular conference, Iâll start with technology. The strategic imperative to innovate technologically is well-known to those whoâve been paying attention, and thatâs many of you here at CSIS.Â  Nations like Russia and China are trying to close the technology gap with the United States, and as I noted, high-end military technology has diffused â sometimes becoming available to countries like North Korea and Iran, as well as non-state actors.Â  And at the same time, our own reliance on technological systems like satellites and the Internet has grown, creating vulnerabilities that our adversaries are eager to exploit. To stay ahead of these threats, and to stay the best, weâre pushing the envelope with research and development in new technologies like data science, biotech, cyber defense, electronic warfare, robotics, undersea warfare, autonomy, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and much, much more.Â  And Iâll repeat yet again, since it keeps coming up, that when it comes to using autonomy in our weapons systems, we will always have a human being in decision-making about the use of force. Now weâre making some serious investments here.Â  Just to remind you, the latest budget Iâve proposed â a budget I strongly encourage Congress to pass when they return to Washington next month â will invest $72 billion in research and development in the next year alone.Â  Thatâs more than double what Apple, Intel, and Google spent last year on R&D combined. This budget marked a strategic turning point for the Department of Defense, with our Third Offset Strategy driving a wide range of new, innovative technological investments in order to advance and sharpen our military edge.Â  Weâre making these investments because we arenât yet exactly certain what, or where, this offset is going to come from â it could be one area of technology, or several.Â  Remember, previous offset strategies were generational successes, reflections of the security environment of their eras, and were only recognized as such after the fact.Â  Today, speed and agility are key, and because of the world we live in, the next offset will not look like previous ones. Â And it may not even end up being what we might consider a traditional âoffsetâ strategy at all.Â  Thatâs why weâre seeding these investments in lots of different technologies â so we can see which ones germinate, how they develop, what they produce, and how we can use them most effectively. And in addition to these critical investments, itâs important to note how DoD is innovating technologically â how weâre innovating technologically â by creating technologies from within, by bringing in technology from without, and by repurposing technologies and capabilities we already have. Â Because different entities are focused on each. Within the Defense Department, we have dozens of DoD labs and engineering centers across the country â each one home to great technological innovators, both civilian and military, who work closely with a very innovative defense industry thatâs long supported us and kept us on the cutting edge.Â  And theyâre continuing to do so today, across a wide range of critical technologies.Â  For example, our Navy labs are developing and prototyping undersea drones in multiple sizes and with diverse payloads â which is important, since among other reasons unmanned undersea vehicles can operate in shallow waters where manned submarines cannot.Â  Also, our Army labs are working on gun-based missile defenses, which can help defeat incoming missile raids at much lower cost per round than more expensive interceptors â imposing higher costs on the attacker.Â  And our Air Force labs are pioneering applications for neuromorphic computing â that is, hardware, software, and systems inspired by the working mechanisms of the human brain â which offers the prospect of overcoming the limitations of current computing architectures, and enabling information superiority in air, space, and cyberspace. As I said, Americaâs innovative defense industry is a key partner in this â because, remember, we donât build anything in the Pentagon.Â  Thatâs not the American way. Â The Soviet Union tried that, and it didnât work out very well for them.Â  Today, with more technological innovation happening in the commercial sector, we need to be able to identify and do business with companies outside our traditional defense orbit as well as those within, and welcome them into our defense technology community.Â  Thatâs why last year I created our Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental, or DIUx â to help build bridges with startups and other commercial technology firms located in innovation ecosystems across the United States, and help us more quickly adopt technologies that can help our troops accomplish their missions.Â  DIUx opened its doors last August with a West Coast office in Silicon Valley, and since then, we iterated and launched DIUx 2.0 in May, and opened a DIUx East Coast office in Boston, and established an outpost in Austin, Texas. Â One important area where DIUx recently solicited proposals is in micro-satellites and advanced analytics â leveraging the revolution in commercial space and machine learning to transform how we use space-based tools and advanced data processing to provide critical situational awareness to forces around the world.Â  And it also adds resilience, by the way, to our national space architecture. Meanwhile, under the guidance of the Strategic Capabilities Office, or SCO, weâre also changing and adapting how we use existing platforms and technologies already in our inventory â giving them new roles and game-changing capabilities to confound potential opponents.Â  As some of you know, I created SCO in 2012 when I was Deputy Secretary of Defense â putting Will Roper, by the way, in charge of it, Will â and earlier this year, I lifted the veil on several of its projects that weâre investing in, such as the arsenal plane, a new anti-ship capability for the SM-6 missile, and swarming drones on the sea and in the air.Â  In fact, this technology took a large step forward just this week.Â  Youâll be hearing more about that in the months to come A prominent theme of SCOâs work is spearheading creative and unexpected new ways to use our existing missiles and advanced munitions across varied domains.Â  One example of this I want to highlight â itâs something that we havenât talked about publically before today â is SCOâs project to develop a cross-domain capability for the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS.Â  By integrating an existing seeker onto the front of the missile, theyâre enabling it to hit moving targets, both at sea as well as on land.Â  With this capability, what was previously an Army surface-to-surface missile system can project power from coastal locations up to 300 kilometers into the maritime domain.* Going forward, as these and other investments yield new weapons systems and warfighting capabilities in the coming years â some of them much sooner than you might think â theyâll need to be demonstrated so that theyâre effective in deterring future conflict. Â And it will be important to ensure they are allowed to run their course.Â  We have to protect the most promising, and integrate those concepts and ideas into our programs, rather than let them be uprooted just because theyâre new â which is always a tendency in tight budgets. Of course, how we use technology is just as important as the technology itself, if not more, which is why weâre also investing aggressively in operational innovation.Â  Our plans and operations must account not only for the evolving challenges we face from our competitors, but also the opportunities afforded by new capabilities as they come on line â so technological and operational innovation must go hand-in-glove. Here, the strategic imperative is rooted in the fact that while weâve spent the last 15 years innovating expertly â and Iâm very proud of it â in how we kill terrorists and counter insurgencies, we did so to some extent at the expense of our expertise in full-spectrum warfighting. Â Other nations have gotten good at that over the years, and in some cases theyâve been devising new methods to try to counter our advantages and pre-empt us from being able to respond â not just by developing high-tech weapons, but also by crafting operational approaches such as hybrid warfare techniques. For these reasons, weâve been reinvigorating our training across the services to return to full-spectrum readiness, and weâve been re-thinking how we operate to find new advantages against potential adversaries â including by changing and adapting how we might fight with friends and allies.Â  For example, in Europe, weâve been working with our NATO allies to adapt and write a new playbook for our Strong and Balanced strategic approach to Russia â one that takes the lessons of history and leverages our allianceâs strengths in new, networked ways to counter new challenges like cyber and hybrid warfare; to integrate conventional and nuclear deterrence; and to adjust our posture and presence so we can be more agile and responsive.Â  And in the Asia-Pacific, weâve been modernizing our alliances, strengthening new partnerships, and helping to build a Principled and Inclusive regional Security Network. This rubber meets the road in how weâre revising our actual plans for potential operations themselves.Â  Now, weâre always updating our plans and developing new operational concepts to account for any changes in potential adversary threats and capabilities, but weâve also updated our core contingency plans to make sure they apply innovation to our operational approaches â including ways to overcome emerging threats, such as cyberattacks, anti-satellite weapons, and anti-access, area denial systems. Â And at the same time that we innovate in our plans to counter these conventional threats, weâre also ensuring that â with respect to potential confrontations with nuclear powers â we continue to sustain Americaâs nuclear deterrent as we recapitalize our nuclear triad and infrastructure.Â  Overall, weâre building in modularity that gives our chain of commandâs most senior decision-makers a greater variety of choices.Â  Weâre making sure planners take into account how to prevail if they have to execute their plan at the same time another contingency is taking place, so they donât fall into a trap of presuming the one theyâre planning for would be the only thing weâd be doing in the world at that time.Â  Weâre injecting agility and flexibility into our processes, because the world, its challenges, and our potential opponents are not monolithic, and we have to be just as dynamic to stay ahead of them.Â  And weâre prioritizing transregional and transfunctional integration in our plans â which is an imperative considering that conflict doesnât segment anymore, and the challenges we face today are less likely than ever before to confine themselves to neat regional or functional boundaries. Â This was one of the Goldwater-Nichols reforms I proposed here at CSIS nearly seven months ago, and it will be coordinated on my behalf by our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Joe Dunford â whom, by the way, weâre very fortunate to have in his job.Â  Recommending him to President Obama was one of the best decisions Iâve made as Secretary of Defense. The result of this is that weâve revised all of our war plans to ensure we have the agility and ability to win the fights weâre in, the wars that could happen today, and the wars that could happen in the future.Â  And while I canât say more â and if any audience can appreciate why, a CSIS audience can â Iâll tell you that Iâm very proud of this evolving family of plans. Now, innovation in technology and in operations are necessary for us, but theyâre not sufficient â because at the pace todayâs world demands, we can only succeed in these by being an agile organization that nurtures innovation in all its forms.Â  So weâre also investing in innovative organizational structures and practices. The strategic imperative here is that DoD must be an organization that better fosters innovative thinking and ideas that can help us to stay ahead of our competitors.Â  The Defense Department is one of the largest organizations in the world, and as many of you know well, we can be pretty bureaucratic and slow-moving, where itâs easy to default to the status quo of continuing to do things the same way weâve always done them.Â  But we canât afford that in todayâs security environment â we need to be a place where thinking differently is welcomed and fostered, not where good ideas go to die just because they happen to be new. Over the last few years, Iâve created a number of entities to help signify and drive innovation throughout DoD â including SCO, DIUx, and the Defense Digital Service.Â  And I most recently created the Defense Innovation Board, to advise me and future leadership on how we can keep growing more competitive.Â  As you know, the Defense Innovation Board is one of several advisory boards that report to me, each with a distinctive mission and membership chosen for a distinctive kind of expertise. Â The Defense Science Board, of which I was long a member, is comprised of scientists and technologists with deep expertise in weapons systems and defense R&D.Â  The Defense Policy Board, on which I also served â and which, by the way, weâre grateful that John Hamre chairs â has a membership with exceptional foreign and defense policymaking experience.Â  The Defense Business Board, to name another, has members who understand DoDâs vast business enterprise and practices.Â  The Defense Innovation Board has a different membership and a different role â its members were chosen for their record of innovation outside of the Defense Department, and for their ability to suggest innovative approaches that have worked in their leadership experience, and that might be applicable to us.Â  The Innovation Board is chaired by Google Alphabetâs Eric Schmidt, and its membership represents a cross-section of Americaâs most innovative industries, organizations, and people â people like Amazonâs Jeff Bezos, LinkedInâs Reid Hoffman, Code for Americaâs Jennifer Pahlka, astrophysicist Neil Degrasse Tyson, Mike McQuade from United Technologies, and retired Admiral Bill McRaven, now chancellor of the University of Texas.Â  And Iâve charged them and the rest of the board to help keep DoD imbued with a culture of innovation â to support innovators themselves, the people in our defense enterprise who are willing to try new things, fail fast, and iterate â and to make sure weâre always doing everything we can to stay ahead of our competitors. At the outset, I gave them the very specific task of identifying innovative private-sector practices that might be of use to us in DoD, along the lines of our Hack the Pentagon pilot program, which invited hackers to help us find vulnerabilities in our networks and report them to us, similar to the bug bounties that several of Americaâs major companies already routinely conduct.Â  While this approach to crowdsourcing cybersecurity is fairly widespread in the private sector, our use of it in the Pentagon was the first time in the entire federal government.Â  And it was so successful, weâre now expanding it to other parts of DoD.Â  This is the perfect example of the kind of recommendations Iâm looking for from the Innovation Board â things that are out there and that might be useful to us. Now, of course, not everything in the private sector will make sense for us, because weâre always mindful that the military isnât a company â itâs dedicated to the profession of arms.Â  And so for important reasons, weâre not always going to be able to do everything the same way others do.Â  But that doesnât mean we canât look ourselves in the mirror and look around the country for new ideas and lessons we can learn, and ways we can operate more effectively.Â  The Defense Innovation Board held its first public meeting earlier this month and made some preliminary recommendations to me and the public about some innovative practices that might make sense for us to adopt.Â  And today I want to tell you about several that Iâve decided weâre going to do. First, weâre going to increase our focus on recruiting talented computer scientists and software engineers into our force, both military and civilian.Â  Weâll do this through targeted recruiting initiatives ranging from our Reserve Officer Training Corps to our civilian scholarship-for-service program thatâs intended to help build the next generation of DoD science and technology leaders â all with the goal of making computer science a core competency of the department. Second, weâre going to invest more broadly in machine learning, through targeted challenges and prize competitions, and not through a new brick-and-mortar institution, but rather through a âvirtual center of excellenceâ model that establishes stretch goals and incentivizes academic and private-sector researchers to achieve them.Â  Since this is an area where both the academy and commercial technology companies have been making significant strides, Iâve asked DIUx to pilot this approach by sponsoring an initial prize challenge focused on computer vision and machine learning. And third, weâre going to create a DoD Chief Innovation Officer, who will act as a senior advisor to the Secretary of Defense and will serve as a spearhead for innovation activities, including but not limited to those suggested by the Defense Innovation Board â such as building software platforms and human networks to enable workforce-driven innovation across DoD at scale, sponsoring innovation contests and tournaments, and providing training and education that promotes new ideas and approaches to collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking.Â  Many different organizations have recently embraced this position, and also started to regularly run these kind of innovation tournaments and competitions â including tech companies like IBM, Intel, and Google â and itâs time we did as well, to help incentivize our people to come up with innovative ideas and approaches, and be recognized for them. Going forward, Iâm confident that the logic behind everything Iâm talking about today will be self-evident to future defense leadership, as will the value of these efforts â but they also need to have the momentum and institutional foundation to keep going under their own steam and to continue to thrive.Â  We must ensure that we keep leading the way, and keep disrupting, challenging, and inspiring all of us to change for the better. And this brings me, finally, to how weâre innovating in terms of our people, and in the talent management of our all-volunteer force. Â While itâs the last area of innovation Iâm going to discuss today, itâs also the most important â because the fact is, our people are the source of every innovative thing weâve ever done, are doing, or will do.Â  Indeed, much more than our technology, operations, and organization, our people are the key to us having the finest fighting force â in our uniformed military, in our DoD civilian workforce, and in the defense industry that supports us.Â  And that means we need to compete for good people as far into the future as we can. Now the good news is, thereâs lots of opportunity here, as well as new techniques and technologies in talent management â such as the kind of advanced data analytics that underpin companies like LinkedIn.Â  But there are also challenges we face â in terms of the limitations of our current technology in the human resources area, and as generations and labor markets change.Â  Even so â so even as our force of today is outstanding â we must ensure that we continue to attract and retain the most talented young men and women that America has to offer in future generations of defense.Â  And thatâs why weâve been taking step after step to build what I call the Force of the Future.Â  Iâve announced four different âlinksâ so far to the Force of the Future.Â  The first focused on building and increasing on-ramps and off-ramps for technical talent to flow in both directions â creating the Defense Digital Service, expanding the Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellows Program, and more.Â  This will let more of Americaâs brightest minds contribute to our mission of national defense, even if only for a time or a project.Â  And it will also allow more of DoD and the defense industryâs innovative military and civilian technologists â of which there are many â to engage in new ways with our countryâs larger innovative ecosystem, especially the parts that may have no experience with, or even have hesitations about, working with defense. Next, the Force of the Futureâs second link focused on increasing retention among our ranks through increased support to our military families. Â Itâs often said that when you recruit a servicemember, you retain a family; after all, itâs no secret that military life is difficult, and can be especially tough on our military families.Â  And let me remind you that our force is largely a married one, with about 70 percent of officers and 50 percent of enlisted who are married.Â  Now, we canât change the fundamentals of military service, but we can make some changes to make life easier for our married people â and increase the possibility that theyâll want to stay at that critical moment when theyâre trying to reconcile military life and family life. Â Thatâs why we expanded maternity and paternity leave, why we extended childcare hours on bases, and why weâre giving more families the possibility of some geographic flexibility in return for additional service commitments. After that, the third link to the Force of the Future focused on how we can make some common-sense improvements to military talent management â particularly for our officer corps.Â  In some cases, our current system proves too rigid.Â  It can limit the ability of our services to achieve the right force mix they need, especially at a time when weâre seeking to promote a wider range of experience, perspective, and training to strengthen the overall effectiveness of the force.Â  Thatâs why we want to give the military services the authority to do things like expand lateral entry for more specialties and adjust lineal numbers based on superior performance. And most recently, link number four to the Force of the Future made clear that this is not only about our military, but also about our civilian workforce. Â When people talk about DoD civilians, theyâre talking about over 700,000 talented Americans serving across the country and around the world.Â  More than 85 percent of them live outside of the DoD â D.C., excuse me â the D.C. area.Â  They fix aircraft, they operate shipyards and ranges, and more.Â  They do critical jobs, and without them DoD wouldnât function.Â  So the goal here is the same as with our military personnel: Â to make sure our future civilian workforce is just as great as the one we have today, in several ways â by directly hiring civilian employees from college campuses, by creating a new two-way civilian talent exchange program with the private sector, by expanding our scholarship-for-service program in mission-critical science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, and more. Also, in addition to each of these links, over the last year we opened up all combat positions to women, and lifted DoDâs ban on transgender servicemembers, so that we can now draw on 100 percent of Americaâs population for our all-volunteer force â focusing purely on a personâs willingness and ability to serve our country and contribute to our mission, and giving everyone the full and equal opportunity to do so. Going forward, there will still be much more work to do â and youâll soon be hearing from me more about the Force of the Future.Â  But these links span the spectrum of our opportunities, our challenges, and the lifetime of a member of our all-volunteer force â recruitment, retention, development, transition â and also our valuable civilian workforce.Â  And for the first time in a long time, DoDâs Personnel and Readiness office has a real, proactive agenda â a concrete action plan to guide its efforts, so that theyâre doing more than just being reactive belatedly to issues that crop up.Â  And based on support for these efforts that Iâm seeing in the military services and across our department, Iâm confident that the implementation of all these initiatives will continue moving forward, and ensure that the Force of the Future is as great as the force of today. Iâve described today a lot of ways the Department of Defense is changing and will continue to change in the future, but I want to close by reminding all of you, all of DoD, and all of America that as we sit here this morning, our countryâs strengths are undeniable.Â  We have the best military, of course â spanning our people, our investments, our dedication to the mission, and the public support we receive from the American people â but thereâs much more than that.Â  Our economy is growing.Â  We have world-class schools and universities.Â  We uphold the right values, which is one reason why we have an unrivaled network of friends and allies.Â  Meanwhile the operational experience of our force â hard-earned â is second-to-none.Â  And we have the greatest innovative culture on the planet.Â  When weâve brought that innovative culture to bear in service of others â that is, to defend our country and help make a better world for our children â itâs long been Americaâs open military secret.Â  And we remain dedicated to doing so, and it can be so.Â  We have a legacy of innovating, but that in itself is not enough.Â  Thatâs why weâre moving aggressively toward a more innovative future, and why everything Iâve talked about today is intended to ensure exactly that.Â  Going forward, our success will depend on whether we can keep it up. Like its predecessors, the next wave of innovation and advantage will be a generational success â and itâs only just beginning.Â  We probably donât even know yet the names of the people who will make it a reality.Â  More likely than not, it wonât be by me or anyone from my generation.Â  Instead, itâll be the generation that comes after. Itâll be junior officers and DoD civilians fresh out of graduate school â some of them here today, perhaps â who decide to spend a year outside of the department at Google or somewhere else, and work with an expert in data science or machine learning.Â  Itâll be the software engineers and bioscientists who get to know our mission by working with one of our DIUx outposts, and then choose to do a tour of duty in the Defense Digital Service or working at one of our DoD labs. Itâll be the enlisted soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who come up with new operational concepts for overcoming potential adversaries using advanced technologies that may not even exist yet, or defeating a terrorist group we havenât heard of. Theyâre the ones â theyâre the ones â who will end up reinventing and changing anew how we will deter, fight, and win wars in the future.Â  Our job is to give them the foundation, the right kind of Pentagon to help them succeed: Â one thatâs more agile and innovative than ever before.Â  As long as we do, they will ensure â like those who came before them â that our military remains the finest fighting force the world has ever known. Thank you. [*Please note, due to an unfortunateÂ error, the following paragraphs were omitted from this speech.] DIUx and SCO share the characteristics of speed and agility, which has long been a focus of mine.Â  When I served as Undersecretary for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics at the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, it was imperative that we quickly get our troops in harmâs way the tools they needed to accomplish their mission.Â  We started the Warfighter Senior Integration Group, which is designed to bring together and bring to bear the full weight of the Defense Departmentâs senior leadership on addressing our most critical operational needs.Â  And we established a âfast laneâ to rapidly field cutting-edge, much-needed capabilities, like mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles and inexpensive aerostat balloons equipped with cameras to help monitor the security of our forward operating bases.Â  Ultimately this evolved into what we in the Pentagon today call Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONs) â or the things we need right away for fighting the wars weâre in now â and Joint Emergent Operational Needs (JEONs) â the things we need as soon as possible for a conflict that could start tomorrow.Â  As Iâve said before, the system is far from perfect, but it has injected some badly needed agility into the Pentagonâs notoriously slow bureaucracy â agility that Iâve been determined to enhance as Secretary of Defense. Â And DIUx and SCO build on this legacy with their focus on quickly meeting the near-term needs of not only todayâs, but also tomorrowâs warfighter.

 Donât buy the MacBook Air Jeff Dunn Oct. 29, 2016, 9:00 AM 81,493 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple rolled out three new MacBook Pros last month. They look interesting! Especially when it comes to thatÂ multifunctional Touch Bar that lives above theÂ keyboards on the two higher-end models. They'reÂ also expensive. The most affordable new model starts $1,499, and doesnât include theÂ Touch Bar. The other 13- and 15-inch models start at $1,799 and $2,399, respectively. Lots of people donât want to pay that. But lots of people also want a Mac. That could make the cheapest MacBook model Apple now sells, the 13-inch MacBook Air, seem appealing. After all, if you look at Appleâs Mac page, itâs now the only notebook thatâs available for less than $1,000. Note that the "MacBook Pro 13-inch" on the right isn't the newest model. A little confusing!Apple That said,Â you shouldn't buy it. Though thereâs always a certain allure to buying an Apple product, you can get better for your dollar in late 2016. Itâs been more than 600 days since the MacBook Air received a significant refresh. (Apple quietly updated the base model from 4GB of RAM to 8GB this past April, but thatâs it.) The company did not respond to a request for comment on whether or not a one-to-one update is coming, but considering how it pitched the Touch Bar-less 13-inch MacBook Pro as superior to the Air on Thursday, you probably shouldnât hold your breath. In any case, that age shows today. What was once a significant leap forward for notebook design has been surpassed on all fronts. There are several thinner and lighter laptops available now. Their bezels are slimmer to boot. Flickr/Tim Trueman The entry-level MacBook Air runs on a 1.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 chip. For a few hundred dollars more, you can go up to a stronger 2.2GHz Core i7 processor. Both of those processorsÂ sound fine, and for the most part they are, but theyâre the 5th-generation âBroadwellâ chips Intel launched in 2015. Weâre on the 7th generation (âKaby Lakeâ) now. That doesnât meanÂ the Air can'tÂ do most everyday tasks. Much like the iPhone and iOS, the MacBook can get more out of lesser specs because Apple intertwines hardware and software so tightly. But itâs still not great. âFineâ is not what you want when youâre shelling out $1,000 for a new computer. Itâs a matter of futureproofing. You donât buy a laptop for today â you buy it for three or four years down the road. In 2019, youâll want a Kaby Lake or Skylake (the 6th-gen chip found in the most recent MacBook Pros) machine more than a Broadwell one. Worse, the Air is notoriously stubborn about letting you upgrade other components like the RAM or hard drive. Reuters/Robert Galbraith Along those same lines, the MacBook Air has no USB-C ports. While weâll all miss Appleâs old MagSafe connector dearly, thereâs a reason why the company put four of these things on its new MacBook Pros: Itâs very obviously where all laptops are headed. Itâs where all non-iPhone smartphones are headed too. Itâs faster, itâs more versatile, and most future accessories are going to use it. Unless youâre on a budget, itâs a must-have today. The worst offender, though, is the MacBook Airâs display. With a resolution of 1440x900, it is simply not up to par for a $1,000 laptop in 2016. There are notebooksÂ that cost less than $600 with sharper screens, lettingÂ you see more things at once. Resolution isnât everything, but even then, the Airâs colors, brightness, and viewing angles are all just decent by todayâs standards. Full disclosure: I look atÂ it everyday for work. It'sÂ just not enough. Flickr/Matthew Pearce To be clear,Â the MacBook Air isnât a bad laptop. Itâs sturdily built, its battery is great, its keyboard is above-average, and its trackpad is second-to-none. Itâs just a laptop from 2015. If any other company launched it for $1,000 or moreÂ today, itâd be roundly ignored. Everyone else has caught up. This makes it all the more frustrating that Apple opted not to update the device last month. The way to make the MacBook Air appealing again seems simple: Refresh the processor, and update the screen to full HD. There is a big, vocal group of peopleÂ who do not want to adjust to the super-thin keyboard on the new Pro models. But Apple is a business, and updating the Air would likely cut into the margins made by the iPad Pro and the new MacBook Pros. Yes,Â thatÂ new MacBook Pro looks and feels fantastic. For now, though, if you donât want to pay that kind of premium, itâs time to leave Mac behind. TryÂ a Dell XPS 13, Razer Blade Stealth, HP Spectre x360, or â if youâre really strapped for cash â Asus Zenbook UX305UA instead.

In English ÐÐ° ÑÑÑÑÐºÐ¾Ð¼ ÕÕ¡ÕµÕ¥ÖÕ¥Õ¶ Full version October 29, 2016 - 14:16 AMT SHARE Armenia announces winner of presidential award for IT development A press conference announcing the winner of the Annual Award of the Armenian President For Outstanding Contribution to Global IT for the year 2016 took place at the Presidential Palace. The event was presided over by Chairman of GIT Award Committee and Chief of Staff to the President Armen Gevorgyan, Ralph Yirikian, the General Manager of VivaCell-MTS - the Company-sponsor of GIT Award - Hovik Musaelyan, Chairman of Executive Board of GIT Award, and Tony Moroyan, Representative of the Award Selection Panel, the CEO and Chairman of Viasphere International. For 2016, the inventor of datagram and founder of Open-Root organization Louis Pouzin, who is also known as one of the founding fathers of the Internet, will receive the presidential award. The Global IT Award is granted on an annual basis to an individual, whose internationally acclaimed contributions to IT have resulted in near-revolutionary or revolutionary developments that have positively impacted or hold the potential to positively impact the humanity. The speakers highlighted the importance of the Award for the development of Armenian ICT Sector and promoting the countryâs image internationally. GIT Award is held in Armenia for already seven years, hosting outstanding professionals from around the world once a year. Armenia hosted the following giants in previous years: the retired CEO/ Chairman of the Board of Intel Corporation, Craig Barrett in 2010, co-founder of Apple Computers, Inc. Steve Wozniak in 2011, Chairman Emeritus of Synaptics, Inc. Federico Faggin in 2012, President of the Society of Semiconductor Industry Specialists, President of Techno Vision consulting firm Tsugio Makimoto in 2013, Senior Vice President and General Manager for the Insieme Business Unit at Cisco Mario Mazzola in 2014, and Chairman and CEO of Kaspersky Lab. Eugene Kaspersky in 2015. VivaCell-MTS has supported the GIT Award during the whole period of its existence, having donated AMD 144.2 million for the realization of the program. The Companyâs support to the award from the very beginning is based on its vision of Armeniaâs future â a country with internationally competitive ICT sector. The Company contributes to this national objective in synergy with impactful projects implemented at a national level. Apart from positioning Armenia and promoting it internationally as a country having achievements and a huge, yet-unrealized potential in the development of ICT, and opportunities for investment in the sector, the Award also has a great role to play internally. The GIT award is stimulating the attractiveness of ICT sector as a professional choice among the Armenian youth. Each visit by a laureate to the country, followed by awarding and lecture by a prominent leader in the sphere of Information Technologies, is a serious promotion of the ICT for the younger generation. âThe sphere of Information and Communication Technologies is one of the key directions of Armeniaâs economic development, and the Award of the President has a great importance in terms of promoting Armenia. Time will pass, and internationally acclaimed figures in the sphere of IT will arrive in Armenia, increasing the awareness about our country as one that relies on its intellectual potential,â said Gevorgyan. âWe are confident that the gurus, who have received this honorary award, will return to Armenia in coming years, bringing with them contemporary culture of high technologies and boosting Armeniaâs image around the world as a country relying on intellect and knowledge,â said Musaelyan. In addition to supporting the GIT Award, VivaCell-MTS has been supporting numerous projects in ICT sector with the amount of social investment in the sphere totaling AMD 953.6 million. âThe award is a powerful tool aimed at showing our achievements in the sphere of ICT to the world and strengthening the countryâs image,â Yirikian commented. âIâm proud that we have managed to bring about the visit of IT legends to Armenia and we hope to repeat it this year,â said Moroyan.

The SSP's order to expedite investigations into the attack on Sima Kumari, a resident of Lohratoli and Hindi honours student at Maulana Azad College, comes a day after Pundag thana outpost OC Rakesh Kumar Singh was suspended for not following up on her August complaint against the local land mafia. City SP Kishore Kaushal said simultaneous probe had begun into the August 12 firing on Sima's house and Thursday's attack. "Raids are being carried out in Pundag for Shiva Munda and Munna Munda, residents of Marang Serang, whom the victim has named in her FIR twice. Intel has been activated and we raided several places since last (Thursday) night," the officer said, not willing to divulge police plans any further. SSP Kuldeep Dwivedi had acted tough against Pundag OC Singh, charged with dereliction of duty and indiscipline, within hours of Sima taking a bullet in her left arm. "Md Farooq will replace Singh as the officer-in-charge of Pundag outpost. Singh has been attached to the district police headquarters. During the suspension period, he will only be entitled to a sustenance allowance," SP Kaushal said. Sima, recuperating at RIMS, said for the first time, since the land mafia laid eyes on her ancestral acres, she felt police were on her side. "I had a providential escape despite being shot at from close range. Land sharks have been terrorising us for months and our complaints were ignored even after our home was targeted by gun-toting men. I am glad that action has been taken against the police officer who did not act against the rogue land brokers," she said, adding that she had written against the OC to the DGP and IG, besides district police brass. Sima is the daughter of rickshaw-puller Bodho Sahu and Kaushalya Devi, and the youngest among five sisters and a brother. The family owns an acre and 69 decimals of land in Pundag, 10km from the capital, which land broker Manoj Munda had grabbed with the help of his musclemen. The broker was shot dead in Nagri in July following which Sima's elder brother Panchanan Kumar was arrested on the basis of suspicion. DSP Sadar Vikas Chandra Srivastava said Sima had lodged an FIR after the August attack on her house, but OC Singh did not act. "That emboldened the accused to make an attempt on the life of the complainant. The department has taken the matter seriously. For dereliction of duty, wantonness and indiscipline, the officer has been suspended till further orders," Srivastava added.

The certification will help to ensure that all WiGig-branded devices, which have been around for some time, can flawlessly operate with each other and deliver expected multi-gigabit performance over 60 GHz spectrum. The WiGig technology (IEEE 802.11ad) is a short range communication standard that enables compatible devices to communicate at up to 7â8 Gb/s data rates and with minimal latencies, using the 60 GHz spectrum at distances of up to ten meters. Since 60 GHz signals cannot penetrate walls, the technology can be used to connect devices that are in direct line of sight. Given the limitation, WiGig cannot replace Wi-Fi or even Bluetooth, but it can enable devices like wireless docking stations, wireless AR/VR head-mounted displays, wireless high-performance storage devices, wireless displays, and others devices which need a lot of bandwidth. To date, Intel and Qualcomm have released several tri-band chipsets that support the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz and 60 GHz spectrums as well as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and WiGig technologies. The Wi-Fi Alliance has already certified Intelâs Tri-Band Wireless 18260 (Maple Peak) and Qualcommâs QCA9500 802.11ad-compatible chipsets as well as multiple devices that use them (including Dellâs Latitude E7450/70 as well as 802.11ad 60 GHz USB adapters from Peraso and Socionext). Going forward, the organization will certify other products, including smartphones and docking stations. It should be noted that the start of WiGig certification on its own isn't going to be the catalyst to cause WiGig adoption to take off, but it will increase chipset developers', device makers', and end users' confidence in the standard. Designers of Wi-Fi chipsets and manufacturers of actual systems have been reluctant to adopt 802.11ad so far because the infrastructure is absent and so is demand, a classic chicken and egg dilemma. With the official certification process things will likely get a little better, mainly because of added confidence. Meanwhile, analysts from ABI Research believe that 180 million of WiGig-enabled chipsets will ship inside smartphones already next year with 1.5 billion WiGig devices shipping in 2021.

Reply Morawka - Friday, October 28, 2016 - link or even notebooks or laptops for that matter. Reply boeush - Friday, October 28, 2016 - link Or even broadband internet? Reply close - Saturday, October 29, 2016 - link Or some sort of wireless tech that can reliably stream a movie from the router to the living room TV... Some AT readers were really hit hard by such issues. Reply Lerianis - Sunday, October 30, 2016 - link close, if you have anything better or equal to Wireless-N equipment you should not be having a problem reliably streaming movies from the internet to your TV unless your internet speeds before they hit your router are not up to par. 5MBps minimum for 1080p content. 25MBps minimum for 4K content. Reply CrimsonKnight - Tuesday, November 01, 2016 - link I stream 4k + DolbyDigital from my FiOS quantum gateway to my TV just fine using the gateway's 802.11ac 5GHz band. Reply Lerianis - Sunday, October 30, 2016 - link We already have broadband internet everywhere except in the uber-boonies in this country or what the feds define as 'broadband internet'. If you want 1GBps speeds you are going to have to harass Congress to stop with the allowing de-facto monopolies, mandating linesharing, and get some true competition into the markets of the United States. Reply marvdmartian - Wednesday, November 02, 2016 - link But that would require Congress to turn down the (no doubt) large "political contributions" they receive, from those very same monopolistic internet service provider companies (cable, phone, satellite, etc), that are paid to ensure they don't meddle in their business, wouldn't it? Might make it a bit more difficult for some of our elected officials to become millionaires, while in office, darn it! Reply Oxford Guy - Tuesday, November 08, 2016 - link Princeton and Northwestern researchers have proven that Congress completely ignores what 90% of the public wants. Don't assume they pay attention much to the lower part of that top 10% either. Reply Morawka - Sunday, October 30, 2016 - link weather broadband has Gbps bandwidth is irrelevant. there are still so many use cases that wiGiG solves, Wireless VR and Video being the main attraction here. Latency is also a concern.

Income inequality has surged near levels last seen before the Great Depression. The average income for the top 1 percent of households climbed 7.7 percent last year to $1.36 million, according to tax data. That privileged sliver of the population saw pay climb at almost twice the rate of income growth for the other 99 percent, whose pay averaged a humble $48,768. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull, File) WASHINGTON (AP) â THE ISSUE: The rich keep getting richer while more Americans are getting left behind financially. Income inequality has surged near levels last seen before the Great Depression. The average income for the top 1 percent of households climbed 7.7 percent last year to $1.36 million, according to tax data tracked by Emmanuel Saez, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley. That privileged sliver of the population saw pay climb at almost twice the rate of income growth for the other 99 percent, whose pay averaged a humble $48,768. But why care how much the wealthy are making? What counts the most to any family is how much that family is bringing in. And that goes to the heart of the income-inequality debate: Most Americans still have yet to recover from the Great Recession, even though that downturn ended seven years ago. The average income for the 99 percent is still lower than it was back in 1998 after adjusting for inflation. Meanwhile, incomes for the executives, bankers, hedge fund managers, entertainers and doctors who make up the top 1 percent have steadily improved. These one-percenters account for roughly 22 percent of all personal income, more than double the post-World War II era level of roughly 10 percent. One reason the income disparity is troubling for the nation is that itâs thinning out the ranks of the middle class. â WHERE THEY STAND Hillary Clinton has highlighted inequality in multiple speeches, with her positions evolving somewhat over the past year. Bernie Sanders held her feet to the fire on that subject in the primaries. Clinton hopes to redirect more money to the middle class and impoverished. Clinton would raise taxes on the wealthy, increase the federal minimum wage, boost infrastructure spending, provide universal pre-K and offer the prospect of tuition-free college. Donald Trump offers a blunter message about a hollowed-out middle class and a system âriggedâ against average Americans. Still, he has yet to emphasize income inequality in the campaign. To bring back the factory jobs long associated with the rise of the middle class, Trump has promised new trade deals and infrastructure spending. But Trump has also proposed a tax plan that would allow the wealthiest Americans to keep more of their earnings. â WHY IT MATTERS President Barack Obama has called rising inequality âthe defining challenge of our time.â And experts warn that it may be slowing overall economic growth. Greater inequality has created a festering distrust of government and of corporate leaders whose promises of better times ahead never fully materialized. The result has been a backlash against globalization that many Americans feel tilted the economy against them. For the top 1 percent, the ability to move money overseas and reach markets worldwide concentrated pay for âsuperstars,â according to economists. At the same time, factory workers now compete with 3 billion people in China, India, Eastern Europe and elsewhere who werenât working for multinational corporations 20 years ago. Many now make products for Apple, Intel, General Motors and others at low wages. This has depressed middle-class pay. These trends have contributed to a âhollowed outâ labor market in the United States, with more jobs at the higher and lower ends of the pay scale and fewer in the middle. Social factors have amplified the trend as well. Single-parent families are more likely to be poor than other families and less likely to ascend the income ladder. Finally, men and women with college degrees and high pay are more likely to marry each other and amplify income gaps. â This story is part of APâs âWhy It Mattersâ series, examining three dozen issues at stake in the presidential election.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images ) Print Email Ted Sickinger| The Oregonian/OregonLive By Ted Sickinger| The Oregonian/OregonLive The Oregonian Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 30, 2016 at 5:55 AM, updated October 30, 2016 at 5:56 AM comments Oregonians buying health care in the individual marketplace face double-digit rate increases in the coming year. And more than a quarter of them â 58,000 people â have lost or will be losing coverage as insurers go out of business or abandon specific markets, particularly in rural areas of the state. It's a painful spike, and one that will make federal subsidies a critical piece of the health care equation for many consumers. In a conference call preview of the open enrollment period that begins Nov. 1, state officials, including the governor, gushed last week about high enrollment levels last year and the now single-digit percentage of Oregonians who remain uninsured. They maintain that 62 percent of Oregonians can find a plan that costs $100 or less in monthly premiums, and that there are 26,000 Oregonians who are eligible for federal tax credits who aren't taking them. But the fact remains, for many consumers, that the Affordable Care Act is hardly that. One 59-year-old rancher in eastern Oregon who asked that his name not be used told The Oregonian/OregonLive last week that his new plan will cost $828 a month, or nearly $10,000 a year. That's a bronze level plan, with a $6,000 deductible and a $6,000 maximum co-pay. Indeed, the individual health care market is costly, chaotic and confusing. Availability of plans and prices vary widely by age and geography. The penalties are rising again for those who go without insurance, as are federal subsidies for those who qualify. So it's worth shopping around, versus automatically re-enrolling in your existing plan. And with open enrollment approaching, it's a good idea to get some help. "All of the plans are changing," said Lisa Morawski, a spokeswoman for Oregon's Department of Consumer and Business Services. "They change every year, so it's good to sit down with someone to help you make that choice." It doesn't cost extra to buy a specific insurance plan through a broker than on your own. You can find an agent in your area by going to OregonHealthcare.govÂ or calling the Oregon Health Insurance Marketplace at 1-855-268-3767. The average monthly premium for a benchmark plan in Oregon is set to go up by 27 percent in 2017. For a 27-year-old, for example, the premium would increase from $225 to $287, according to federal government data released earlier this month. That's slightly higher than the national average, which is poised to jump 25 percent in states that use HealthCare.gov. Coverage is far more spendy as you get older. And the cost varies widely based on where you live. A 40-year-old in Portland, for example, can expect to spend $324 a month next year for Health Net Health Plan's silver level plan. In Hermiston, that same person could expect to spend $476, or 47 percent more, for the same coverage, according to the Department of Consumer and Business Services. Tax credits Federal tax credits are the primary means of making the Affordable Care Act affordable. What you qualify for depends on your modified adjusted gross income, and a set of IRS guidelines that detail the percentage of tax filers' earnings they are expected to contribute toward health insurance. Again, it's a complicated equation. But bottom line, subsidies are available to anyone making less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level. That ends up being a fairly high number. Next year, it's anything less than $47,520 for a single household and $97,200 for a family of four. Consumers who are eligible for the tax credit also may be eligible for lower co-pays and deductibles when they see a doctor. Those cost-sharing reduction subsidies are available to consumers who make from 100 to 250 percent of the federal poverty level. In 2016, nearly three-quarters of the 135,965 individuals who bought insurance through Oregon's exchange qualified for a subsidy, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. On average, the tax credits reduced monthly premiums by 64 percent. For the Spears family in Banks, the tax credit was even more generous. James Spears took early retirement from Intel last year. As part of the deal, the tech company covered his family's insurance premiums for 18 months. But that coverage expired in August, pushing them into the individual marketplace. They went to a broker, who took their data and returned with three plans from which to choose. They ultimately selected Providence. It wasn't the cheapest; it will leave them paying for chiropractic and physical therapy visits out of pocket, for instance, but it gave them the best mix of affordability and coverage. They also got a major subsidy. With their income down this year, their youngest child qualified for coverage under the Oregon Health Plan. The cost of their individual plan for two adults and their son is about $1,000 a month. The federal subsidy covers almost 80 percent, said Patricia Spears. "It was a nice relief, even if adjustments come up later on," she said. "Because of the threshold being where it's at, you can get to the point where you can actually afford to live and have health insurance." But she also reiterated the need to use an agent. "I wouldn't even try to do any of it myself," she said. The subsidies aren't tied to individual plans. They're based on the benchmark plan in the area â the second-lowest cost silver plan. It's also important to estimate your income as accurately as possible when applying, said Gladys Boutwell, the agent who worked with the Spears family. The tax credits reduce your monthly premium right away, but the IRS ultimately squares up with taxpayers at the end of the year. "If they underestimate their incomes, they may have to pay part or all of it back," Boutwell said. Individual mandate The Obamacare penalty for not having insurance â also called the individual mandate â is also increasing. In 2014, it was 1 percent of modified adjusted gross income, or $95, whichever was higher. It jumped to the greater of 2 percent of MAGI, or $395 for 2015. This year it's 2.5 percent of MAGI, or $695. In 2017 and subsequent years, the penalty will continue going up by the rate of U.S. inflation, That's likely to be a modest increase, given that inflation is so low. But it compounds each year. And don't forget, you're paying for each adult household member and child who is uninsured. The penalty for being uninsured this year is $695 per adult and $347.50 for each child younger than 18, with a maximum of $2,085. About 93 percent of Oregonians had health insurance in 2015, up from 90.3 percent the previous year, according to figures from the U.S. Census Bureau. Young adults, those 19 to 34, still had the lowest coverage rates, according to the Oregon Health Insurance Survey. The report found several contributing factors, including the fact that young adults lose coverage under their parents' plans at age 26; they're less likely to have health insurance through work; and they may think they don't need it. But the cost of insurance is getting prohibitive for many age groups. Boutwell says she hears tales from clients each year. They don't want the government to tell them what to do, they don't think they need it, or feel like they're wasting money. She usually shares her own experience on that front. Three years ago, her husband got laid off from his job, and put off buying insurance for a few months. He ended up having to get his appendix removed because of severe appendicitis. "A month later, we got a bill for $20,000," she said. "It's worth paying the premium." --Ted Sickinger tsickinger@oregonian.com @tedsickinger Insurance Guide 2017 Need help with open enrollment?

The business was originally part of Softwin, a company founded by chief executive Florin Talpes and his wife Mariuca in Bucharest in 1989, the year of Romaniaâs anti-communist revolution, when he worked as a researcher in a computer science institute. Mr Talpes developed anti-virus software to protect against threats coming from Bulgaria, a common source of viruses in the 1990s. He spun off the operation from Softwin in 2007 and Bitdefender now claims to have a presence in more than 100 countries. The companyâs rivals include Norton, owned by American company Symantec, McAfee, part of Intel, Kaspersky of Russia, Trend Micro and Sophos. It claims to have its technologies installed on more than 500m devices in homes and offices across the world. Bitdefender had revenues of $74.7m in 2014 and the company is now wholly owned by Mr Talpes. âBitdefenderâs strategy is to go public in the near future,â he told The Sunday Telegraph. âTherefore in 2017 we plan to attract a minority investor in the company. We havenât made a decision regarding which stock exchange we will go with, and the London Stock Exchange is not excluded.â Last week financial software supplier Misys postponed its stock market return, blaming âmarket conditionsâ.Budget gyms operator Pure Gym also delayed flotation plans recently.

Essays & Reviews Features Blogs &, Meanwhile News Magazine Archive Shop About Â  Mapping the Sneakernet By An Xiao Mina Digital media travels hand to hand, phone to phone across vast cartographies invisible to Big Data I stood at the corner of Market Street and 4th Avenue, at the edge of San Franciscoâs technology-startup neighborhood. An older Chinese womanâletâs call her Feiâapproached my friend and me, asking for directions in her extremely limited English. In her hands was a piece of paper with directions from Google Maps, to a location somewhere much further south in the city. âOne second,â I said. âWeâll check the address.â My friend pulled out his phone and punched in the English language address of her destination into a maps app and received a few public-transit options for how to get there. I asked Fei if she had a phone so I could send her the information, but she said, âI just have a pen.â I ended up writing down the directions on the back of her printout and wished her luck, pointing her in the direction of the bus she needed and double-checking my orientation with my phoneâs compass app. In traditional tech parlance, a phoneless woman like Fei would be considered one of the 4.3 billion who are said to be unconnected to the Internet. The International Telecommunications Union, a branch of the United Nations, measures connectivity via fixed landline, mobile, or broadband subscriptions. Ciscoâs Visual Networking Index measures global mobile data traffic to gauge growth in usage. McKinsey and Co.âs research defines the offline population as those who havenât gone online in the past 12 months. Following the implicit logic of such statistics, it can be easy to assume that being unconnected means having no exposure to the Internet at all. Phrases like âconnecting the unconnected,â âthe next billion,â and âthe digital divideâ all suggest this binary: One either has access to the Internet or doesnât; one lives on the wired side of the tracks or one doesnât. But as tech ethnographer Jan Chipchase wrote recently, âConnectivity is not binary. The network is never neutral.â Between those whoâve never touched a computer and those who get a feed of data directly into their Google Glass sits a vast array of modes and methods of connectivity. The most commonly-discussed of these is shared access. Just as a family in the rich world might share a television, families in the developing world often share devices and telecom accounts. In rural Luzon, the largest island of the Philippines, Iâve seen groups of people access the internet via Facebook. One personâthe one who is formally connected and countedâhas the account, but many others are able to see their feed, access web sites, hear and tell stories from abroad and around the country. Shared access is often overlooked in connectivity studies but has been documented in India, Peru and many other countries. Beyond shared usage, there are other, more informal methods of accessing what the web has to offer, extending through urban areas in developed countries through rural areas in the global south. Feiâs ability to navigate the city depended on the Internetâa printout from Google Maps, and then my friendâs Internet connection to update it. Chances are, if she got lost again, a non-Chinese speaker with machine translation software could try to help her figure out what was going on. To call her unconnected would be to ignore the many forms of connectivity and social support around her that effectively enabled her to access data from the web. And there are countless others like her, extending across âunconnectedâ parts of the world. Both informal communities in urban areas and rural locales in developing countries often feel like the edge of the Internet, where the next billion are just starting to come online. But, first, to understand the edges, it helps to understand the center and how the concept of âconnectivityâ is constructed. * * * The Internet can feel ubiquitous in both developed and developing parts of the world, but those who access the web directly are a privileged minority. For many people reading this essay, the Internet looks like a wi-fi icon in the upper right hand corner of their screen or an ethernet cable with one end plugged into a computer and another plugged into a wall. But what happens after the wall is unclear, presumed to be in the hands of professionals. In Tubes: A Journey to the Center of the Internet, author Andrew Blum focuses on the other side of the wall, beginning with a simple anecdote of a squirrel that chews a wire and cuts off his Internet in Brooklyn, leaving him effectively unconnected until the repair technician could come to his home. From this experience, he moves on to detail the server farms, exchange points, data engineers, and construction workers that maintain the worldâs connectivity. Despite the ridicule heaped on Senator Ted Stevensâs now infamous description of the Internet as a âseries of tubes,â the Internet, Blum demonstrates, is actually filled with tubes: fiber-optic tubes, Ethernet tubes, power tubes, transatlantic tubes that mirror the telegraph cables that were strung between London and New York in the 19th century. âThe undersea cables,â he writes, âshowed how that new geography was traced entirely upon the outlines of the old.â Blum reveals that the web is made not of spiderâs silk but miles and miles of machinery, each part built as a result of complex decisions and layers. He illustrates how the forces of geography, politics and economics combine to affect the worldâs access to bandwidth: Undersea cables link peopleâin rich nations, firstâbut the earth itself always stands in the way. To determine the route of an undersea cable requires navigating a maze of economics, geopolitics, and topography. For example, the curvature of the planet makes the shortest distance between Japan and the United States a northern arc paralleling the coast of Alaska and landing near Seattle. But Los Angeles has traditionally been the bigger producer and consumer of bandwidth, exerting a southward tug on earlier cables. With TGN-Pacific, Tyco solved the problem the expensive way, by building both. Tubes, of course, are not the only way data travels on the Internet: The electromagnetic waves of mobile and wi-fi networks pass invisibly through us, broadcast by towers powered by electric wires or diesel. Tubes highlights how much of the Internet consists of very physical data handoffs, storage and routing, all powered by human decisions and relationships. Blumâs writing soars when his earnest fascination with this comes to the fore, as when he describes walking around New York City: I was captivated by the idea of the light [of fiber optic cables] pulsing beneath the streets. Climbing down the steps into the subway, Iâd imagine the red lights sticking out of the concrete decking. This was the municipal corollary to what was going on inside the [network] router. But it wasnât the realm of egghead engineers, their glasses reflecting with strings of numbers. It was about thick bundles of cable and dirty streetsâan even heavier reality. I started to wonder just how that light got in the ground. Still, it can be easy to assume, after reading Blumâs book, that where no tubes or electromagnetic waves flow, no Internet goes. But just outside the bookâs scope, the connectivity binary begins to break down. The very story he starts withâa squirrel nibbling away at his tether to the larger worldâmisses the alternate ways he had to get a message out, to download movies, to access a map. He just had to ask his neighbor, assuming he couldnât get online through his phone. And if his neighbors didnât have Internet access, they could have asked their neighbors. Data spill forth from the tubes, carried along on USB drives or through word-of-mouth exchange, mobile Bluetooth handoffs, and âsneakernetsâ of data transferred hand to hand, foot by foot. If there was a sequel to Tubes, it might be called Sticks, Mouths, Teeth, and Sneakers. * * * In the dry season of 2013, I visited Aber and Atura, small villages tucked away between Gulu and Lira, the two largest cities in Northern Uganda, each with a population of a few hundred thousand. I conducted this visit as part of my graduate research at Art Center College of Design, with support from UNICEF Ugandaâs Innovation Lab and Intel Labsâs Interaction and Experience Research Group. I am grateful to Aber Youth Center and research associate Daniel Nanghaka. Accessible via an hour-long bike ride from the nearest paved highway, Aber and Atura have a few hundred people each and, like much of the region, they have no running electricity or water (electric wires are strung along some roads but are not connected to the grid). Young women hike miles in each direction to pick up water for their families, and as night descends, families light torches and campfires to prepare food by mud and wattle huts. Satellite photos of the region show darkness, but satellites canât capture the soft glow of a mobile phone. Many residents use their phones to text their friends and keep in touch. Mobile-phone towers dot the landscape, providing 3G Internet access to those who can afford it (a small minority) and SMS/voice access for the others (a larger minority). They power their phones at mobile charging stations set up by enterprising families who invest about $100 to $200 for a solar panel manufactured in India or China. Nor can satellites hear the music. At night, residents turn on their radios, and those who can afford Chinese feature phones play mp3s. One day, I heard familiar lyrics: Hey, I just met you And this is crazy But hereâs my number So call me maybe I turned my head. A number of young people gathered around a woman rocking out to Carly Rae Jepsenâs âCall Me Maybe,â a song that owes so much of its success to the viral power of YouTube and Justin Bieber. The phoneâs owner wasnât accessing it via the Internet. Rather, she had an mp3 acquired through a Bluetooth transfer with a friend. Indeed, the song was just one of many media files I saw on peopleâs phones: There were Chinese kung fu movies, Nigerian comedies, and Ugandan pop music. They were physically transferred, phone to phone, Bluetooth to Bluetooth, USB stick to USB stick, over hundreds of miles by an informal sneakernet of entertainment media downloaded from the Internet or burned from DVDs, bringing media thatâs popular in video hallsâbasically, small theaters for watching DVDsâto their own villages and huts. Video halls have a long and documented history in Northern Uganda, dating back to the civil war, when people watched VHS films in small rooms. In geographic distribution charts of Carly Rae Jepsenâs virality, youâd be hard pressed to find impressions from this part of the world. Nor is this sneakernet practice unique to the region. On the other end of continent, in Mali, music researcher Christopher Kirkley has documented a music trade using Bluetooth transfers that is similar to what I saw in northern Uganda. These forms of data transfer and access, though quite common, are invisible to traditional measures of connectivity and Big Data research methods. Like millions around the world with direct internet connections, young people in âunconnectedâ regions are participating in the great viral products of the Internet, consuming mass media files and generating and transferring their own media. Indeed, the practice of sneakernets is global, with political consequences in countries that try to curtail Internet access. In China, I saw many activists trading media files via USB sticks to avoid stringent censorship and surveillance. As Cuba opens its borders to the world, some might be surprised that citizens have long been able to watch the latest hits from United States, as this Guardian article notes. Sneakernets also apparently extend into North Korea, where strict government policy means only a small elite have access to any sort of connectivity. According to news reports, Chinese bootleggers and South Korean democracy activists regularly smuggle media on USB sticks and DVDs across the border, which may be contributing to increasing defections, as North Korean citizens come to see how the outside world lives. Blum imagines the Internet as a series of rivers of data crisscrossing the globe. I find it a lovely visual image whose metaphor should be extended further. Like water, the Internet is vast, familiar and seemingly ubiquitous but with extremes of unequal access. Some people have clean, unfettered and flowing data from invisible but reliable sources. Many more experience polluted and flaky sources, and they have to combine patience and filters to get the right set of data they need. Others must hike dozens of miles of paved and dirt roads to access the Internet like water from a well, ferrying it back in fits and spurts when the opportunity arises. And yet more get trickles of data here and there from friends and family, in the form of printouts, a song played on a phoneâs speaker, an interesting status update from Facebook relayed orally, a radio station that features stories from the Internet. Like water from a river, data from the Internet can be scooped up and irrigated and splashed around in novel ways. Whether itâs north of the Nile in Uganda or south of Market St. in the Bay Area, policies and strategies for connecting the âunconnectedâ should take into account the vast spectrum of ways that people find and access data. Packets of information can be distributed via SMS and mobile 3G but also pieces of paper, USB sticks and Bluetooth. Solar-powered computer kiosks in rural areas can have simple capabilities for connecting to mobile phonesâ SD cards for upload and download. Technology training courses can start with a more nuanced base level of understanding, rather than assuming zero knowledge of the basics of computing and network transfer. These are broad strokes, of course; the specifics of motivation and methods are complex and need to be studied carefully in any given instance. But the very channels that ferry entertainment media can also ferry health care information, educational material and anything else in compact enough form. There are many maps for the worldâs internet tubes and the electric wires that power them, but, like any map, they reflect an inherent bias, in this case toward a single user, binary view of connectivity. This view in turn limits our understanding of just how broad an impact the Internet has had on the world, with social, political and cultural implications that have yet to be fully explored. One critical addition to understanding the internetâs global impact is mapping the many sneakernets that crisscross the âunconnectedâ parts of the world. The next billion, we might find, are already navigating new cities with Google Maps, trading Korean soaps and Nigerian comedies, and rocking out to the latest hits from Carly Rae Jepsen.

Picture: Munish Sharma Thomas Malthus was wrong for one simple reason. Humans have survived his 1798 forecast that growing populations wouldn't be able to feed themselves because innovation and productivity gains allowed them to produce more and more with the same amount of labour and capital: Irrigation, fertilizers, higher-yielding plant species and mechanisation have enabled farmers to grow 5 to 6 times the amount of grain from the same piece of land as a century ago. The problem is that similar productivity gains may no longer be possible -- or effective. There's general agreement about the factors that improve productivity. Investment in machinery and equipment increases production levels and quality. Education and training improve worker skills. New products, technologies, organisational structures and work arrangements - in other words, innovation - raise efficiency. A healthy climate for entrepreneurship and competition encourages the creation of faster, smarter businesses. Unfortunately, there's also general agreement that productivity gains are flatlining. In advanced economies, productivity growth has fallen below 1 percent annually, significantly lower than the 3 to 4 percent common in postwar decades and even less than the 2 to 2.5 percent of the last decades of the 20th century. Similar trend lines are beginning to appear in developing nations. Combined with stagnant or declining workforces, slowing productivity gains are a key factor suppressing growth worldwide. What no one can agree on is why this is happening. Some economists think traditional measures designed for manufacturing-heavy economies simply aren't detecting productivity gains in services, or the effect of newer, information-intensive technologies. There's also a natural lag between the introduction of new technologies and their full effect. It may simply be too soon to see productivity improvements. Fundamental issues Yet such factors have always been present to some degree; they'd also have affected earlier productivity estimates. The real issues are more fundamental - and intractable. Take the shift from manufacturing to services. The latter may not lend themselves to improvements as easily as industrial processes. They can't all be automated. Many are local and not globally traded, and so don't benefit from international supply chains. It's hard to improve on certain personal services. A one-hour massage always takes one hour. The non-routine and non-repetitive tasks involved in, say, healthcare and aged care can't easily be sped up. The immense gains in education and skills over the last 50 years may not be repeatable. Rising costs have placed higher education beyond the reach of many. They've also forced graduates to start their working lives with significant debts, undercutting the attractiveness of going to college. The rise in contract or part-time jobs has contributed to de-skilling, since workers have little incentive to invest in training. A lack of retraining means that the skill levels of older workers -- a rising share of the workforce - quickly become dated. Many "new" manufacturing technologies are already being extensively exploited. New energy technologies, such as fracking and renewables, aren't breakthroughs comparable to the discovery of hydrocarbons or electricity itself; they require certain conditions, such as high oil prices, to be efficient. Many biotech, IT and financial innovations are focused on lifestyle, longevity, consumption and entertainment -- all of which have limited productivity benefits. In many ways and many places, it's becoming harder to start and grow businesses. Regulations and class-action lawsuits have made doing business more complex and expensive. Anti-competitive behaviour makes life tough for would-be disrupters, even in the technology sector. There's now one major chipmaker (Intel), a few hardware makers, two dominant computer operating systems (Microsoft's Windows and Apple), two dominant mobile operating systems (Android and iOS) and one major suite of business software (Microsoft's Office). Cloud computing is the preserve of Amazon, Microsoft and Google. The internet is dominated by Google (search), Amazon (e-commerce) and Facebook (social networks). Among established companies, the frequently short tenures of chief executives and pressure to show short-term results work against productivity gains. Financial engineering to boost share prices is favoured over risky, longer-term initiatives such as research and development or staff training. And finally, since 2008, unconventional monetary policies have clearly distorted the economy. Low interest rates have impeded the shift of capital from inefficient to more efficient enterprises or industries, allowing unproductive businesses to live on. This has left capital tied up in marginal firms and restricted the supply of credit to smaller, often more innovative companies. Any benefit? Even if productivity growth could be revived, it's not clear those gains would have as much of an impact on living standards as in the past. Simply being able to make more stuff isn't terribly helpful in an era of excess capacity and also weak aggregate demand. Many innovations actually eliminate jobs and depress wages. They allow a few creators to capture large benefits but don't aid the majority of the population. A much-quoted study from Oxford University found that 47 percent of all jobs are threatened by automation. In 1967, Boeing employed 400 workers per each aircraft produced. By 2015, that number had dropped to 113 workers per aircraft, a decline of 72 percent. The company believes that the worker-to-aircraft ratio can be reduced another 60 percent in the next 20 years. Fewer workers mean even less demand. Given that consumption makes up 60 to 70 percent of economic activity in developed economies, productivity gains may thus depress rather than boost growth. Even if the world can solve this one conundrum, plenty more questions -- about employment, income and inequality - await. - Das is a former banker, whom Bloomberg named one of the world's 50 most influential financial figures in 2014.

Maui 2 "Blue Tang" Linux Still Based on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ships KDE Plasma 5.8.2 GO It now uses its own software repositories and Calamares Oct 29, 2016 00:45 GMT Â Â·Â  By Marius Nestor Â Â·Â  Share:Â  Do you remember Maui? It's the new name gave by the Netrunner team to their Netrunner Desktop flavor earlier this summer, rebased on KDE Neon and shipping with the latest Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus) goodies. The first Maui release, versioned 1, landed in mid-August, and we've just been informed about the general availability of Maui 2, dubbed "Blue Tang," featuring the recently released KDE Plasma 5.8.2 LTS desktop environment on top of an updated Ubuntu 16.04 LTS base, and, of course, running the long-term supported Linux 4.4 kernel. Maui 2 also ships with the latest KDE Applications 16.08.2, KDE Frameworks 5.27.0, and Qt 5.7.0 technologies, as well as the Mozilla Firefox 49.0.2 web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird 45.4.0 email and news client, which just landed in the stable Ubuntu repos on October 27, 2016. Talking of repos, Maui 2 comes with new software repositories. "We decided to move our repositories to a new infrastructure and cloned the Neon based repo so we have control over when to push new updates to the user and let the users themselves decide when they want to move to a new Plasma version or KDE Frameworks 5 version," reads the release announcement. Calamares universal installer now used by default That way, Maui users will always receive the latest stable KDE Plasma desktop environment, and guess what? Maui 2 switches to use the Calamares universal installer framework for GNU/Linux distributions as the default graphical installer for new Maui 2 installations. We remind you that Calamares 2.4 offers full-disk encryption support. Apart from bringing us the latest KDE Plasma 5 desktop experience and the Calamares installer, Maui 2 "Blue Tang" also reimplements the Driver Manager, an in-house built tool that promises to let you install the latest proprietary drivers for your hardware, including Nvidia, AMD or Intel graphics cards and Wireless chips. Ultimately, Maui 2 includes a new tool for configuring systemd services, replaces the GParted partition editor with KDE Partition Manager for a better disk partitioning experience, improves language translation support in the mintUpdate tool, enhances the KDE Telepathy Instant Messaging feature, and adds Inkscape and KDE Remote Desktop Client. You can download the Maui 2 64-bit live ISO image right now via our website, and if you're currently running the Maui 1 release on your personal computer, you can update to Maui 2 using the upgrade instructions provided by the development team on the project's official forums, where you'll also find all the help you need to get started with the Maui OS. #Maui 2#Maui Linux#Netrunner#Ubuntu 16.04 LTS#Linux subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related Â Â·Â  Hot right now Â Â·Â  Latest news HP Linux Imaging & Printing 3.16.10 Adds Support for Ubuntu 16.10 and Debian 8.6 Linux Kernel 4.8.5 Lands with Numerous CIFS, ARM64, and PowerPC Improvements Linux Mint 18.1 Slated to Launch Later This Year, Will Be Codenamed âSerenaâ Ubuntu 17.04 "Zesty Zapus" Now Tracks Linux Kernel 4.9, Could Ship Kernel 4.10 Microsoft Pledges to Completely Retire Office 2007 Next Year Firefox 50.0 Officially Released for Linux, Mac and Windows, Here's What's New Some U.S. Android Phones Have Secret Backdoor That Sends Data to China Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall Microsoft Pledges to Completely Retire Office 2007 Next Year X.Org Server 1.19.0 Officially Released, Coming Soon to a Linux Distro Near You Red Hat Software Collections 2.3 and Red Hat Developer Toolset 6 Available Now Linux Kernel 4.4.32 LTS Adds Networking Improvements, Updated AMDGPU Drivers Â Â  Maui 2 Linux Other Linux Distros openSUSE Linux: The new and improved SUSE Linux operating system, a community-driven distribution LFA (Linux For All): A 64-bit only Linux-based operating system that features four desktop environments Salix OS Xfce Live: A Live Linux distribution based on Slackware Linux and featuring the Xfce desktop environment Tails OS: An open source live Linux operating system focused on Internet privacy and anonymity 4MLinux Core: A core version of the 4MLinux operating system aimed for building your own distro NethServer: A beautifully engineered server oriented operating system based on the CentOS Linux technologies Black Lab Linux: An Ubuntu-based Linux operating system that features the Xfce desktop environment Reader comments Load old comments Â  Canonical Patches Multiple Kernel Vulnerabilities in All Supported Ubuntu OSes more on: Ubuntu 16.10 i softpediaÂ® Â  Â Â Like 202K Â Â Â +1 56K Â  Â Â Follow 13K Â© 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Dr Michael Naylor, a senior lecturer in insurance at the Massey Business School, has undertaken a meta-analysis of how a range of technologies will change the industry in the coming decade. His report, âA Perfect Storm in Insurance: How to Survive the Looming Waves of Disruptive Technologyâ aims to help insurers prepare for a very different future. âInsurers need to change their view of their business as a provider of insurance products to being a data company with real-time links to customers, specialising in personal services,â Dr Naylor says. âAny organisation that is not a big data house now, or is unable to become one soon, is already a legacy company.â Dr Naylorâs vision of the future also has many implications for consumers. âIn the future, all insured objects will give constant, real-time feedback to the insurerâs data centre â and that includes people. Wearable technology can provide minute-by-minute blood pressure readings and tell if your blood chemistry indicates an illness,â he says. âThrough the connection of objects to the internet it will be possibe for insurers to know how healthy the food in your fridge is or how often you exercise. Imagine how accurately they can then predict your health risk for insurance purposes. âYou have to agree to share this information, of course, but if you do and you are healthy, you should see your insurance premiums plummet. But if you donât agree to it, youâll be classed as high-risk and your premiums will be very expensive.â Dr Naylor says the car insurance industry will probably be the first to sector to face major disruption. âOnce networked, autonomous cars are widely available, itâs been predicted that car crashes will reduce by 80 to 90 per cent. This development is not as far away as you might think â Volvo, for example has an aim of eliminating car crashes by 2020.â Dr Naylor believes car theft will largely become a thing of the past as voice and face recognition technology makes them nearly impossible to steal, leaving insurance only for damage caused by things bumping into the car or extreme weather events. âThe result is car insurance premiums will fall drastically, probably by as much as 90 per cent by 2030.â He says that while many might view his report as speculation, there are plenty of examples of innovative insurers overseas who are using technology to change their business models. British insurer Drive Like A Girl monitors the drivers it insures via a telemetric device that sends real-time reports, including alerts of any crashes. The company is popular with young drivers who can prove they shouldnât have to pay the high rates generally imposed on them, Dr Naylor says. âThen thereâs American firm Social Intel, which provides data to underwriters by using software to analyse peopleâs social media posts, rather than more traditional metrics. âNew Zealand insurers are probably a few years behind those in the United States and Europe, but they need to start grappling with these changes now. If they donât, new disruptors will emerge to take their business from them.â âA Perfect Storm in Insurance: How to Survive the Looming Waves of Disruptive Technologyâ can be purchased as a paperback or downloadable PDF from: https://sway.com/tOcPLREeEb0fFaQe The full report covers: Â· Key disruptors Â· Telemetrics Â· Big data Â· Social media Â· Automated underwriting Â· Automated claims Â· Robo advice Â· Motor insurance Â· Health and life insurance Â· Suggestions for how insurers can restructure their business to survive Â© Scoop Media Â  Tweet Â  Â  Â  Â  Business Headlines | Sci-Tech Headlines BUSINESS, SCIENCE & TECH > > Â  Easing Ending?

News Home > Metro > SMEBiz > News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 31 October 2016 R&D shifting to software 123rf.com Companies that allocate more of their research-and-development budgets to software and service rather than physical products are reporting significantly higher revenue growth than others, says PwCâs Strategy&. BY 2020, companies will have shifted the majority of their research-and-development spending away from product-based offerings to software and service offerings, according to the 2016 Global Innovation 1000 Study from Strategy&, PwCâs strategy consulting business. The need to stay competitive is the top reason why companies cited a shift in their R&D budgets towards software and services, and for good reason, according to the study. It said companies that reported faster revenue growth relative to key competitors allocated 25% more of their R&D budgets to software offerings than companies that reported slower revenue growth. Between 2010 and 2015, the average allocation of R&D spending for software and services increased from 54% to 59%, and is expected to grow to 63% by 2020. Meanwhile, the average allocation of R&D spending dedicated to product-based offerings fell to 41% (from 46% in 2010), and is expected to fall to 37% by 2020 â an overall decrease of 19% this decade. Average allocation of R&D spending on software offerings alone will increase by 43% by the end of this decade, and R&D spending on services will gradually overtake investment in product-based innovation (39% vs 37% by 2020). Global R&D spending on software offerings has increased by 65% between 2010-2015, from US$86bil to US$142bil. Many of the worldâs major innovators are in the midst of a transformational journey mostly driven by changing and rising customer expectations, says Barry Jaruzelski, innovation and R&D expert for Strategy& and principal with PwC US. The shift is also being driven by the supercharged pace of improvement in what software can do, including the increasing use of embedded software and sensors in products, the ability to reliably and inexpensively connect products, customers and manufacturers via the Internet of Things (IoT), and the availability of cloud-based data storage. Companies will recruit fewer mechanical engineers and more data and software engineers to build their capabilities, the study predicts. To support the development of software and services offerings, fewer companies will focus their R&D spending on the electrical and mechanical field. By 2020, the number of companies reporting electrical engineers as their top employed engineering specialty will fall by 35% and the proportion of companies who expect that data engineers will represent their largest group of employed engineers will double from 8% to 16%. Jaruzelski says an increase in software and services, even in more traditional industries has created a shift towards hiring talent that can develop software and provide platforms to collect and analyse product-related data. The shift is already changing the way business schools think about their course offerings, and will have profound effects both on education and, more generally, on the future of employment. Regionally, companies in North America are making the strongest shift to software offerings from 15% of total R&D spending in 2010 to 24% in 2020. Asia remains the most product-centric region, with 44% of R&D allocated to product offerings in 2010, only falling to 40% in 2020. The automotive and industrial sectors are making the most aggressive push towards developing new software offerings. Among companies that made an acquisition during the past five years, the vast majority (71%) were made to enhance capabilities in software (33%) or services (38%). Strategy&âs annual analysis of the worldâs 1000 largest R&D spenders also found the following: By 2018, the healthcare sector will surpass computing and electronics to become the largest R&D spending industry globally (US$165bil vs US$159bil), and the software and Internet industry will leap ahead of the automotive sector (US$129bil vs US$105bil). Industrials rounds out the Top 5 R&D industries by spend. For the first time in the studyâs history, the number of Global Innovation 1000 companies headquartered in the US grew, up 9.5% year over year. Volkswagen, Samsung, Amazon, Alphabet (Google) and Intel round out the Top 5 R&D Spenders, with Amazon and Google making bold moves up the list (+4 and +2 positions, respectively). Global innovation professionals responding to a 2016 survey have ranked Apple, Alphabet (Google), and 3M as the three Most Innovative Companies in the world.

TRENDING NOW: Watch Dogs 2 first impressions Home News CPU, APU & Chipsets AMD's next-gen APU has Zen CPU cores, Vega GPU, and HBM2 AMD's upcoming 'Raven Ridge' APU will have PS4-class graphics, with Vega GPU and HBM2 By: Anthony Garreffa | CPU, APU & Chipsets News | Posted: Oct 30, 2016 12:51 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA AMD has an exciting year ahead of itself in both the CPU and GPU divisions, with their next-gen Vega GPU architecture set to be unveiled soon, and their upcoming Raven Ridge APU that has some surprising tech inside of it. Â  Â  According to the latest report from Bitsandchips.it, AMD is working on a few Raven Ridge APUs - with the higher-end model featuring a 1024-core Vega GPU with HBM2, 16 CUs, DDR4 support, with Zen CPU cores (4 x CPU cores, 4 x - and it all arrives in TDPs of between 35-95W. Â  The lower-end version loses the HBM2 technology and kicks the Vega GPU from 16CUs on the high-end model, to 12 CUs on the lower-end model. The 170mmÂ² part will have a TDP of 4-35W, with both versions of the Raven Ridge APUs being made on the 14nm FinFET process. Â  Â  Surpassing Xbox One/PS4 Level Graphics/Performance Â  Let's face it, the rendering power of the PS4 isn't that great - but for mainstream gamers, it's enough. What is enough, though? 1080p 30FPS is about the norm with consoles these days, at around Medium preset graphics. The new HBM2 tech inside of the Raven Ridge APUs will be interesting, as I'm sure AMD will show game developers how to better utilize the much-faster memory technology for added performance inside of the lower APU power envelope. Â  AMD recently made it into Apple's latest MacBook Pro with its Radeon Pro 400 series graphics, which hits 35W and is based on the Polaris 11 GPU with 1024 stream processors and 2 TFLOPs of performance. Â  AMD's next-gen APU is a CPU/GPU in one, versus the Polaris-based Radeon Pro 400 series GPU inside of the new MacBook Pro. The new APU from AMD mixes the upcoming next-gen Zen CPU architecture with Radeon Technologies Groups' next-gen Vega GPU architecture into a single, low-powered, monster APU. Â  This means we can expect much better performance from the Zen and Vega-powered Raven Ridge APU, as the respective CPU and GPU architectures are expected to be much better than what's available right now. Â  Prepare to be excited: AMD is definitely in a position of power going into 2017, as it has forged the end of 2016 well with a successful launch of their Polaris-based Radeon RX 400 series graphics cards. But 2017 is looking even better with their next-gen Zen and Vega architectures, and the thought of AMD once again being in a position of having both a great CPU and GPU is really quite exciting. Â  Intel can't quite get a grip on the GPU side of things, and NVIDIA isn't on the PC side of CPU dominance (while it has CPU cores inside of its Tegra SoCs, they're mostly found in tablets - but NVIDIA has just hit the Nintendo Switch console). This gives AMD a big chance to nail 2017 to the wall with CPU, APU, and GPU launches. NEWS SOURCES:Bitsandchips.it Recommended for You Intel's new Kaby Lake-based Core i7-7700K will cost...

Oct 30th 2016, 9:30 AM 15,545 Views 4 Comments Share6 Tweet Email1 Image: Conor McCabe Photography Ltd AN IRISH HEALTHCARE startup bankrolled by a venture capital firm set up by the head of Starbucks has just raised a fresh $40 million (â¬36 million) in funding. Genomics Medicine Ireland (GMI), which was founded last year, is an early stage life-sciences company researching the genetic causes of conditions such asÂ Alzheimerâs and multiple sclerosis. Speaking about the funding announcement,Â GMI chief executiveÂ Daniel Crowley said the series A investment would be put towards the creation of a genomic research and development centre and hiring 150 new staff over the next three years. He added that the company, which is based at DublinâsÂ NovaUCD, will soon announce itsÂ first collaboration with an Irish hospital. âWe look forward to working closely with the Irish healthcare system to develop better diagnostics and new means to optimise health and patient outcomes,â he said. âThe size and characteristics of the Irish population can powerfully advance scientific discovery as researchers are able to pinpoint variations in DNA relevant to disease and useful for improving medicine.â The latest round of funding was provided byÂ Arch Venture Partners, Polaris Partners and the VC firm formerly known as Google Ventures. Maveron, a venture capital firm established by Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz, was a previous seed investor in the company but was not part of this series A investment. Irelandâs sovereign wealth fund,Â the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), is also involved in the funding round. Earlier this year, ISIF director Eugene OâCallaghan said it planned to commitÂ over â¬750 million to Irish companies and funds during 2016. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz Source: AP Photo/Ted S. Warren Beginnings GMI was set up by a group of entrepreneurs, investors and researchers from the health-tech space in 2015 and is run byÂ Crowley, with the former head of the drug company HiberGen and researcher atÂ PfizerÂ Maurice Treacy also on board as a director. Crowley and Treacy are both venture partners atÂ Arch Venture Partners, one of the main investors behind GMI, that has over $2.5 billion committed in funding to different startups worldwide. Arch has funded over 200 companies since it was created 30 years ago, including Irish chip manufacturerÂ Movidius that is in the process of being bought by Intel. It also backed genetic research company Illumina and biopharmaceutical company Receptos, which was bought for $7.2 billion last year.

Home Auto Gadgets Hardware Internet IT Science Software Blogs Polls Submit News Hardware Apple Launches New MacBook with Two Missing Items Saimin (Blog) - October 29, 2016 1:00 AM Print Recipient E-mail Sender E-mail Appleâs new MacBook Pro comes in two sizes, 13 inch and 15 inch. It comes with a touch bar and touch sensitive display along with a touch ID sensor. Â  Â  Â  It will go in the market from $1400.00 to 1,700.00 and higher. The Apple TV, iPad and iPhone has TV app in USA.Â  TV app allows you to select the show that you want to watch from one central location and moves straight into the correct app. Â  As this has been the case in the past, the Apple app does not support Netflix, and jumping to correct app does not work in this case.Â  MBP 13 inch does not have new Touch Bar but it is repudiation of the top-end laptops layout.Â  The new MacBook Pro is a thinner and lighter Laptop with Touch ID fingerprint scanners but nether USB-A ports and SD card slot nor MagSafe power adapter. Instead it has quick access to emoji with Touch Bare, and 3.5 mm headphone socket. Â  To use existing accessories with the new Laptop, you will need adapters, which are not included. Â  EMOJI:Â  to use the Emoji feature, position the cursor in any text field that you would like to insert an emoji like a tweet then press the command + control key+ press the space bar and click on the Emoji icon on the sidebar. Here is an emoji box example. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  The new laptop has OLED panel, which is better than standard keyboard, which replaces multiâfunction F keys and allows shortcuts to control window management and volume functions.Â  According to Phil Schiller, senior vice president of worldwide marketing for Apple: âItâs a retina display, multitouch, responding to gestures and taps. We call it Touch Bar. First it replaces the standard system functions, but it goes way beyond that. It adapts to whatever software youâre using.â Â  Â  Stephen Lam- Getty images Â  Â  You could see emoji or Emoticons on the keyboard displayed, which was demonstrated at the Apple Event on October 27,2016 in Cupertino. Also, more about the functionality of Touch Bar was discussed and shown by Graig Fedeighi senior vice president of software engineering for Apple.Â  Â  Â Â  Â  Â  According to Apple media discussion at Cupertinoâs event, the new 13 inch MBP can be upgraded with the Intel dualâcore i5 or i7 processor, 8GB of RAM, 256 GB storage and Iris 550 with a faster gaming, video editing and 3D graphics performance, than previous versions. Â  According to Tony Avelar/ EPA.Â  Four Thunderbolt 3 USBâC mean that all old USB accessories will require adapter to connect them to new MacBook Pro.Â  Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â  If you are in the market for purchasing one, make sure to shop around, also it would be a bad idea if you wait a week or so for more reviews to come out with real pricing. However, we recognized in the past that Apple products do well with testing and this may be another one that just took or will take over the market. It sounds too phenomenal to ignore.
