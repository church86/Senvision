NFL is No Fondleslab League: Top coach says he'd rather use pen and paper than Surface tab Samsung airport exchange Microsoft hooks up reprogrammable chips directly to its data centers' internal networks to ramp up the performance of its web applications. The Windows giant is so impressed by the tech, it reckons the customizable hardware could eventually take on more computational work than the Intel workhorse processors that today fill its servers. This comes as Google signals its intention to run non-Intel CPUs in its data centers. In a research paper titled A Cloud-Scale Acceleration Architecture, Microsoft describes how mainlining field-programmable gate arrays straight into its network boosts the performance of Bing search query returns and other services. The paper appeared online today, and will be published by the IEEE Computer Society's 49th symposium on microarchitectures, which kicked off on Saturday. FPGAs are reprogrammable chips that are chock full of decision-making circuits that can be linked together to form an application in silicon: think of the arrays as a box of Lego bricks that you can assemble as needed to build a new thing. Rather than create toy space stations and pirate ships, though, you're crafting specialized hardware that can crunch data at high speed, ideally far faster than software running on a generic processor. Microsoft has been exploring the use of FPGAs since 2010 with its Project Catapult effort. Last month, it went public with its use of the Intel Altera FPGA chips in its Azure cloud. The logic arrays sit on a daughter board within their host servers together with their own RAM. The boards are connected to the host CPUs by a PCIe gen-3 interface. They are also wired directly into a nearby switch using a 40Gbps QSFP link and pass packets to and from the network to the host server's traditional NIC. Thus, the FPGA acts an accelerator, directly manipulating data as it flows in and out of the machine. Microsoft's design essentially moves the FPGA into the direct path of incoming requests and outgoing data, which saves having to shunt data from the NIC to the FPGA and back again over an internal system bus. The arrays can handle tasks all by themselves in silicon, or pass information to the host Intel x86 processors to operate on if needed and potentially perform additional manipulations on the data while in transit. For example, the FPGAs can encrypt and decrypt data on the fly before it hits the app running on the box. The basic outline of the FPGA-CPU-network design ... Source: Microsoft The result, says Microsoft, has been a decrease in latency for all of the cloud services using the design. "By enabling the FPGA to talk directly to the network switch, each FPGA can communicate directly with every other FPGA in the datacenter, over the network, without any CPU software," Microsoft researchers write in their paper. "This flexibility enables ganging together groups of FPGAs into service pools." By doing this with the Bing web search data centers, Microsoft researchers found that the servers were able to handle higher loads of search queries more quickly, and with the need for fewer machines. We're told that the FPGA-accelerated design has been "deployed at hyperscale in Microsoft’s production data centers worldwide." The Redmond researchers believe that the integration of FPGAs can have similar results with other cloud computing platforms, whether they be web applications or local cloud tasks such as software-defined networking. "With the Configurable Clouds design, reconfigurable logic becomes a first-class resource in the datacenter, and over time may even be running more computational work than the data center's CPUs," Microsoft concludes. For what it's worth, Intel is working on x86 Xeon processors with builtin FPGAs. ® Sponsored: 10 Reasons LinuxONE is the best choice for Linux workloads Tips and corrections 39 Comments More from The Register Intel is shipping an ARM-based FPGA.

Supplier Deserves More Credit This chipmaker builds many of the less talked about chips inside of Apple's flagship smartphones. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 17, 2016 at 12:22PM Image source: Intel.  It's well-known that Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) is the sole supplier of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) A10 Fusion processor that powers the recently released iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus smartphones. The chip is manufactured in TSMC's 16-nanometer technology, and according to Chipworks, it even employs TSMC's InFO chip packaging technology. (In a nutshell, this means more dollar content for TSMC beyond wafer manufacturing services.) Although much of the focus in the press is around the manufacturer of Apple's A-series processor, it's important to note that there are a lot of chips inside of a smartphone. None are as high value as the applications processor, but the content is significant nonetheless. TSMC has clearly done a good job of nabbing Apple's A-series business over the last several years, but investors shouldn't ignore the fact that it builds many of the other chips inside of Apple's iPhones, as well. Let's take a look at several examples. The cellular modem (and related RF) Apple is probably the last major smartphone vendor to use stand-alone applications processors and cellular modems. In the iPhone 7, teardown reports have revealed that Apple is sourcing cellular modems (and associated chips) from both Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), a longtime supplier of Apple modems, and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The Qualcomm modem, known as MDM9645, is known to be manufactured in TSMC's 20-nanometer manufacturing process. The Intel modem, branded XMM 7360, is built in a foundry 28-nanometer process. BlueFin Research Partners say that this part, too, is manufactured by TSMC. Beyond the baseband processor, though, TSMC is believed to be a key manufacturer of the RF transceivers used in iPhones, as well. Chipworks says that the RF transceiver that's used in the Intel version of the iPhone 7/7 Plus is built by TSMC, and it's likely that Qualcomm's RF transceivers are built by TSMC, as well. The fingerprint sensor Back in 2015, DigiTimes reported that the fingerprint sensors inside of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus smartphones were manufactured in TSMC's 0.18-micron manufacturing technology. That same report also claimed that the second-generation fingerprint sensors inside of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are manufactured in TSMC's newer 65-nanometer manufacturing technology. At Apple's keynote and in its marketing materials for the iPhone 7-series smartphones, the company makes no mention of dramatic changes to the fingerprint sensor. It's likely, then, that Apple is using the same sensor in the iPhone 7-series phones as it did in the iPhone 6s-series phones. In that case, TSMC profits from the iPhone by manufacturing the Touch ID sensor, as well. The connectivity combo chip The Wi-Fi/Bluetooth connectivity combo chip, as well as the GPS chip inside of the iPhone 7-series phones, are almost certainly both provided by Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). (Chipworks confirmed the latter, and Broadcom's public commentary confirms the former.) According to a 2014 form 10-K filing, Broadcom counted TSMC as one of its main contract chip manufacturing partners. And back in 2012, Chipworks confirmed that the Broadcom Wi-Fi/Bluetooth combo chip inside of the iPhone 5 was manufactured by TSMC. I believe that it's very likely that TSMC is one of the manufacturers -- if not the only one -- of the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth connectivity combo chips inside of the iPhone 7-series smartphones. No wonder TSMC rakes in so much from smartphones In TSMC's most recent earnings presentation, the company said that a full 60% of its revenue in the quarter came from communication products. This includes, and is likely mostly comprised of, chips that go into smartphones. It's not surprising, given how much content within major smartphones like the iPhone 7 it is responsible for manufacturing, that the company has benefited so much from the smartphone boom. Going forward, as smartphone unit shipment growth cools off, TSMC is going to have to rely increasingly on content growth within smartphones -- through share gains, selling higher value technologies, and so on -- to try to outperform the overall smartphone market.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

Earnings: What to Expect From the Chip Giant on Tuesday The financial results should hold very few surprises, thanks to a mid-quarter guidance update. Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) Oct 17, 2016 at 9:01AM Image source: Getty Images. On Tuesday night, computer chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is set to report results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. Management likes to keep investors in the loop on what to expect from these updates, so we're not likely to see any huge surprises. Here's the lay of the land according to Intel's latest guidance announcements: Data Point Q3 2015 Result Q3 2016 Original Guidance (Midpoint) Q3 2016 Updated Guidance (Midpoint) Revenue $14.5 billion $14.9 billion $15.6 billion GAAP gross margin 63% 60% 62% GAAP operating expenses $4.8 billion $5.1 billion $5.2 billion GAAP earnings per share $0.64 $0.60 $0.72 Data source: Intel's investor relations. Guidance updates from Intel in the middle of a quarter used to be rare, but the company has done several of them in recent years. This time, management explained that the PC supply chain is refilling depleted inventories to prepare for a potentially busy end of the year. Both consumers and enterprise computing shops seem poised for a strong holiday season and year-end budget purges, potentially putting an end to several years of declining PC systems demand. Boosted by this rosy market view, the new guidance points to roughly 8% year-over-year sales growth and 12% higher earnings. Other companies in the PC supply chain have reinforced Intel's positive view, with improving demand reported by hard-drive makers and memory chip specialists. In other news, this will be Intel's first earnings report under newly appointed CFO Bob Swan. Longtime financial chief Stacy Smith has taken on a different role at the company, more involved in sales and manufacturing operations. Smith's title was shouldered by equally inveterate eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) CFO Bob Swan as of Oct. 10. Both Smith and Swan are highly experienced professionals, so the CFO transition is hardly any cause for alarm. That being said, the earnings call will take a new direction. Smith has a history of fielding lots of questions in these post-earnings phone conferences, often handling a larger query load than CEO Brian Krzanich. Swan certainly took an active part in eBay's calls, but most of the Q&A action was handled by eBay's and PayPal's CEOs. So all things considered, we Intel investors can look forward to solid year-over-year growth along the lines of the updated guidance figures, along with an increased amount of commentary by Krzanich.

Auto Show 2016: News, Interviews, Videos, New Car Models (Investor's Business Daily) More than a third of the Dow Jones Industrials are on deck to report quarterly results this week. Wall Street expectations are particularly high for leading tech and financial giants. Only a few of these companies are expected to post shrinking earnings. The third-quarter earnings reporting season is in full swing, and most of the Dow Jones Industrial Average components are expected to share their latest results over the next two weeks. This week alone brings us reports for 11 of the 30 Dow members, and the Wall Street expectations are highest for Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE: UNH). The consensus analysts' forecasts call for double-digit growth in earnings and solid revenue results from all three. Some of Goldman's peers have already posted better-than-expected results, and Intel raised its revenue guidance during the quarter. But note that UnitedHealth recently was accused of price gouging on prescription drugs. Below is a quick look at what is expected from these three reports, as well as a peek at a few other Dow components that also are on tap to share their quarterly results this week. Goldman Sachs The third-quarter profit of this New York-based financial giant is anticipated to have risen more than 23 percent from a year ago to $3.79 per share, according to Wall Street analysts. The consensus of 79 Estimize respondents has earnings coming in at $3.93 per share. Note that both Wall Street and Estimize underestimated earnings in the previous quarter. In Tuesday morning's report, analysts are looking for $7.42 billion in revenue for the three months that ended in September, a little less than the $7.60 billion that Estimize predicts. Either forecast is more than 8 percent higher than the revenue reported a year ago, but also less than the $7.93 million reported for the second quarter. See also: False Hope: The Street Believed Twitter & Salesforce Rumors For Too Long Intel In its report after Tuesday's closing bell, this leading semiconductor maker is expected to say that it had EPS of $0.73 in its third quarter, according to Estimize. That would be up from a profit of $0.64 per share a year ago. The Wall Street consensus estimate is $0.72 per share, though the analysts, like Estimize, have underestimated EPS in the past few quarters. Estimize narrowly overestimated revenue in the previous quarter, and this time the 193 respondents are looking for $15.56 billion. The Wall Street estimate is essentially the same, and both forecasts are a little less than the midpoint of Intel's guidance range. In the same period of last year, the company reported $14.46 billion in revenue. UnitedHealth The consensus Wall Street forecast calls for this Minnesota-based health plan provider to post third-quarter EPS of $2.08 (up $0.31 from in the same period of last year) and for revenue to have risen around 11 percent to $46.09 billion in the period. Note that UnitedHealth topped expectations on both the top and bottom lines back in the second quarter. Estimize is a bit more optimistic, with the consensus of 15 respondents pegging EPS at $2.10, and revenue of $46.19 billion is expected for the three months that ended in September. Estimize also underestimated the results back in the second quarter. UnitedHealth is scheduled to share its latest results before Tuesday's trading session begins. And Others Also this week, the consensus forecasts call for per-share earnings at Dow members General Electric, Johnson & Johnson, McDonald's and Microsoft to be higher than a year ago. Note that McDonald's is the only one that analysts predict will also have declining revenues. On the other hand, the consensus forecasts call for EPS at American Express, IBM, Travelers and Verizon to be smaller than a year ago. The following week, look for reports from Apple, Boeing, Caterpillar, Chevron, Coca-Cola, DuPont, Exxon Mobil, Merck, Procter & Gamble, 3M, United Technologies and Visa, as well as many others not included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

According to UD News, Hangzhao Liaison Interactive Information Technology Co., Ltd. (Liason Interactive from here on out) is in the process of closing a deal to buy a 55.7 percent stake in Newegg. The deal is estimated to be worth around 17.7 billion yuan (around $2.63 billion), and once finished, the California electronics dealer would effectively become a subsidiary of Liaison Interactive. PC Gamer Intel will add deep-learning instructions to its processors Some of the latest Intel processors support the AVX-512 family of vector instructions. These instructions operate on blocks of 512 bits (or 64 bytes). The benefit of such wide instructions is that even without increasing the processor clock speed, systems can still process a lot more data. Most code today operators over 64-bit words (8 bytes). In theory, keeping everything else constant, you could go 8 times faster by using AVX-512 instructions instead. Daniel Lemire Verizon, AT&T Made $600 million in overage fees alone in 2016 A new study claims that Verizon and AT&T made $600 million alone in 2016 just on overage fees. And while both telcos unveiled new plans that let you avoid $15 per gigabyte overages in exchange for just being throttled (Verizon's "safety mode" and AT&T's Mobile Share Advantage) the study by Nerd Wallet found that thanks to buried surcharges and other fees, users on these new plans may not save much money. DSLReports Microsoft: No more pick-and-choose patching Adobe and Microsoft today each issued updates to fix critical security flaws in their products. Adobe's got fixes for Acrobat and Flash Player ready. Microsoft's patch bundle for October includes fixes for at least five separate "zero-day" vulnerabilities -- dangerous flaws that attackers were already exploiting prior to today’s patch release. Also notable this month is that Microsoft is changing how it deploys security updates, removing the ability for Windows users to pick and choose which individual patches to install. Krebs on Security Bendable electronic paper displays whole color range Less than a micrometre thin, bendable and giving all the colours that a regular LED display does, it still needs ten times less energy than a Kindle tablet. Researchers at Chalmers University of Technology have developed the basis for a new electronic "paper". Their results were recently published in the high impact journal Advanced Materials. Phys.org Kaspersky Lab reveals advanced persistent threat, StrongPity Kaspersky Lab today announced a stealthy threat actor known as StrongPity, a technically capable Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) interested in encrypted data and communications, according to a paper presented at Virus Bulletin by Kaspersky Lab principal security researcher, Kurt Baumgartner. Users in Italy and Belgium were hardest hit, but people in Turkey, North Africa and the Middle East were also affected. Kaspersky Cutting the cord: 200 channels but only 20 worth watching? We have come a long way from the pay-TV scenario Bruce Springsteen bemoaned in 57 Channels (And Nothin' On). But after a look at the most recent Nielsen TV viewing data you certainly can understand why consumers are crying out for slimmer pay-TV bundles. With more than 200 channels available on their cable, satellite or telco-delivered service, viewers are actually watching, on average, only about 20 channels, according to recent research from Nielsen. USA Today Ford engineer called MyFord Touch infotainment system 'a polished turd' Documents in a class-action lawsuit against Ford and its original MyFord Touch in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) system reveal that the company's engineers and even its top executive were frustrated with the problematic technology. The documents from the 2013 lawsuit show Ford engineers believed the IVI, which was powered by the SYNC operating system launched in 2010, might be "unsaleable" and even described a later upgrade as a "polished turd"... Computerworld At the world's first Cybathlon, proud cyborg athletes raced for the gold Last Saturday, in a sold-out stadium in Zurich, Switzerland, the world’s first cyborg Olympics showed the world a new science-fiction version of sports. At the Cybathlon, people with disabilities used robotic technology to turn themselves into cyborg athletes. They competed for gold and glory in six different events. IEEE Spectrum Using GPUs to speed through the 1.2B record taxi dataset New York City is special to us.

Police arrest five in major streaming site crackdown Police in Brazil have carried out the second phase of Operation Blackbeard, a campaign designed to dismantle groups dedicated to online copyright infringement. Search warrants led to five arrests and the seizure of bank accounts connected to three streaming sites with three-quarters of a billion visits per year. TorrentFreak New record for fusion On Friday, Sept. 30, at 9:25 p.m. EDT, scientists and engineers at MIT's Plasma Science and Fusion Center made a leap forward in the pursuit of clean energy. The team set a new world record for plasma pressure in the Institute's Alcator C-Mod tokamak nuclear fusion reactor. Plasma pressure is the key ingredient to producing energy from nuclear fusion, and MIT's new result achieves over 2 atmospheres of pressure for the first time. MIT (360-degree tour of the facility) The $100 muon detector When Spencer Axani was an undergraduate physics student, his background in engineering led him to a creative pipe dream: a pocket-sized device that could count short-lived particles called muons all day. Muons, heavier versions of electrons, are around us all the time, a byproduct of the cosmic rays that shoot out from supernovae and other high-energy events in space. When particles from those rays hit Earth’s atmosphere, they often decay into muons. Symmetry Examining Windows 10 Anniversary Update's driver signing enforcement policy Windows 10 Anniversary Update came out at the beginning of August, with plenty of new user-facing features. There were also plenty of changes under the hood as well, including a change in policy regarding how Windows 10 handles device drivers. When the 64-bit versions of Windows launched over a decade ago, as a security measure Microsoft decided to require that all kernel mode drivers must be signed to be loaded.

Home Auto Gadgets Hardware Internet IT Science Software Blogs Polls Submit News Hardware Is Razer Blade Stealth Laptop For You? Saimin (Blog) - October 16, 2016 5:00 AM Print Recipient E-mail Sender E-mail The New Razer B.S has improved battery life, performance, and is powered by Intel Core i7 processor. This new Razer Blade Stealth crushes competitors across the board. At the beginning of 2016 The Razer Blade Stealth 12.5 – inch Ultrabook production hit the market, and in less than a year it is getting ready for major upgrade with hope of success. As it is mentioned above, the new upgrade will be a 2.7 GHz Intel Core i7-7500 U Processor, Kaby Lake ‘s new generation of chips.  This upgrade includes a bigger RAM and storage, and leaving space of 16GB the former, and 1TB of PCIe SSD space for future upgrade. The laptop is equipped with a 4K (3840 x2160) touchscreen with a higher price of more less about $1800.00; this upgrade will cost more out of pocket for consumers.     Of course the Razer’s customers could always purchase the one with a lower price that is closer to their needs. Razor Blade Stealth is not a gaming machine. However, you could still use it for basic gaming. On the other hand, Razer came up with an Ultrabook that can transform into an even more powerful machine.   Here is a picture of the Razor Core and external dock that brings desktop-grade graphics power to gaming.     The base model of the Razer comes with a QHD (2560 X 1440) display and 128GB SSD for the price under $1,000.00 while the top end model with   4K display and 512 GB option runs under $1,600.00 with no expandable, but SSD can be upgraded personally.   The market is in favor of the Ultrabook and it is not going to change this since there are a variety of vendors with amazing products such as HP’S Spectre x360 15t, Lenovo’s Thinkpad x1 Yoga, ASUS’s and Zenbook UX-305CA. While all of these offer their own functionality, ends to have it all in a light and thin machines.   In today’s market most of the Ultrabooks come with Intel’s processor or Core M chips   Blade Pro   This 17.3- inch laptop with HD (1920 X1080) matte antiglare display has enough space to work or play, portability of a laptop and functionality of a desktop.   The new Razer Blade Pro has 256 GB SSD plus 500 GB HDD with a sale price of under $2,500.00, of course all the prices are subject to change in the market place like anything else.     Blade 17 Pro   At the price of $ under $3000.00, comes with Quad Core i7, 2.6 GHz, and 16GB RAM Along with GTX 960 M (4 GB VRAM) and completed by 1920x 1080 TN display.  This is 8 pounds instated of 10 pounds.  There is a nice keyboard and excellent audio on this laptop. However, the hardwires are easily accessible.    On the other hand, the Blade 14 with the same Quad Core i7 and same size GHz and RAM with a little difference on IGZO display with 3200x1800 also there not much difference on the price.    If you are in the market for a gaming laptop, there are many available in the market. The point is how much you want to spent and what is your expectations are from performance and graphics. So you need to shop around for the machine that is right for you before you could decide.      "And boy have we patented it!" -- Steve Jobs, Macworld 2007 Latest Headlines Here Goes Intel and AMD - Neck and Neck Again November 14, 2016, 5:00 AM Refurbished Desktops and More in Today’s Market November 13, 2016, 5:00 AM AMD Inspires Innovation Everywhere November 12, 2016, 1:00 AM Wi-Fi on Intel USB 3.1 November 11, 2016, 1:00 AM NVIDIA Corporation Scores the Microsoft Surface November 2, 2016, 8:27 AM Apple Launches New MacBook with Two Missing Items October 29, 2016, 1:00 AM More Headlines Most Popular Articles27” Curved Monitors – Samsung SD590 vs HP Pavilion 27c November 9, 2016, 2:00 AM Smart Thermostats - Nest Learning Thermostat vs Ecobee3 November 10, 2016, 1:00 AM Wi-Fi on Intel USB 3.1 November 11, 2016, 1:00 AM UTHealth Clinical Trial Shows Progress Using Stem Cells to Treat Traumatic Brain Injury November 8, 2016, 1:00 AM Uber Partners with Circulation to Pilot Program Connecting Transportation and Digital Health Care November 6, 2016, 5:00 AM Latest Blog Posts Cancer Screening in the Community Is there a link between Cancer and Poverty?

One such company is Ockel, which is developing a mini PC running full Windows 10 that can fit in the palm of your hand. The interesting device, named Ockel Sirius A, has been fully funded on Indiegogo and expects to ship in May 2017. Touting the Sirius A as the most "versatile Windows 10 mini PC ever created", Ockel has claimed that the device is small enough to fit in your pocket. The Sirius A sports a 6-inch full HD touchscreen display that the company says will fit all your gaming, media, communication and professional needs. As the device runs the full 64-bit version of Windows 10, it is compatible with all Windows programs. The full specifications of the Ockel Sirius A are as follows: System: Windows 10 Home 64-bit Processor: Intel Atom x7-8750 quad core (1.6GHz up to 2.56GHz) RAM: 4GB LPDDR3-1600 Display: 6-inch full HD (1920x1080px), 4K and UHD support Dimensions: 85mmx150mmx6mm-120mm Graphics: Intel HD Storage: 64GB eMMC, micro SDXC slot (external storage up to 2TB) Connectivity: 2xUSB 3.0, 1xUSB Type C, HDMI, DisplayPort, RJ-45 Ethernet, 3.5mm headphone jack, power (12V/3A) Wireless: Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 3165, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2 Battery: 3000 mAh Lithium polymer (up to 4 hours of video playback), 36W adapter Sensors: Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer Integrated: Front-facing camera, speakers, microphone Ockel says that it is also working with Microsoft to integrate software features that are exclusive to the Sirius A, such as the "switch mode". When the user connects the device to another display, they'll have the option to quickly switch the Sirius A to an input device, so it can be used as a mouse or a keyboard. Additionally, the company claims that the Sirius A is "100% silent". Although it doesn't include ventilation fans, it makes use of a "heat sink" that removes all excess heat. Ockel says that its team has over 70 years of combined experience, which also includes special advisor and founder of Laser Computer Paul Pardon, who has more than 30 years of experience in the computer market. It is also being aided by Microsoft, which is providing technical support related to Windows 10. Last year, the company also managed to successfully gather funding for the Ockel Sirius B and Sirius B Black Cherry on Indiegogo. The company's Indiegogo campaign reached its $100,000 funding goal in two days, and has now been funded to 242% of its goal by 455 backers with 24 days still to go. The starting perk has already reached its limit of backers, so now the company is allowing supporters to order the Sirius A with a 128GB microSD card and a power bank for $559. It plans to unveil more perks once the current perk reaches its limit of supporters. Ockel says that it has already developed the first fully functional prototype Sirius A mini PC and is currently working on the second one. When the company ships the device in May 2017, it is expected to be available in three colors - Moon Silver, Meteor Grey and Venus Gold - and will retail at $699 before shipping.

First, we know that Apple elected to skip a CPU generation, waiting for Skylake with Thunderbolt 3 support.

Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Oct 17, 2016 at 5:44PM Image source: Getty Images. NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock run-up of 137% over the past 12 months has sparked immense interest in the company lately. But like many other companies, NVIDIA's stock has had a series of rise and falls over its 17-year history listed on the Nasdaq. To better understand the company and why it's experiencing big gains right now, let's take a look at what the company does and a brief analysis of whether or not the stock is a buy.  What NVIDIA does NVIDIA's two primary business segments are its sales of graphics processors, called GPUs, and its Tegra processors. Between these two segments the company then splits out its revenue business into four key markets: Gaming Professional visualization Data center Automotive Gaming is by far the company's most lucrative market, with company bringing in nearly 55% of its total revenue from gaming in fiscal Q2 2017. NVIDIA holds a dominant position in the gaming space, with its GPUs holding a 70% market share in discrete desktop GPU market share, leaving rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) with just 30%.  Take a look:  Data source: Jon Peddie Research.  After gaming, the company's professional visualization segment brings in the next highest amount of revenue, representing about 15% of total revenue in Q2 2017. NVIDIA is steadily improving sales in this business as well, and revenue from professional visualization was up 22% year over year in Q2.  NVIDIA also supplies GPUs for automakers and its automotive segment brings in about 8% of the company's total revenue. NVIDIA is also a leader in the driverless car technology space with its Drive PX 2 supercomputer and its newly released Xavier system-on-a-chip (SoC). These technologies bring situational awareness to semi-autonomous cars by using NVIDIA's GPUs to process visual information.  And last but not least is NVIDIA's data center segment, which brought in about 6.8% of the company's total revenue in fiscal 2016. But data center revenue is growing quickly, and in Q2 2017, revenue improved nearly 110% year over year. It's worth mentioning that NVIDIA also brings in revenue from its original equipment manufacturer and intellectual property segment, which consists of lower-priced graphics cards as well as royalty payments from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). It's the only NVIDIA business that's on the decline right now, but it should continue to be offset by growth from the company's other businesses. How NVIDIA stock has performed Historically, NVIDIA's stock price has seen a few jumps and drops over the past few years, but the price is seeing historic highs lately:  Data by YCharts. NVIDIA's recent gains have come from posting strong sales growth over the past few quarters, all while scoring more opportunities in new markets. Specifically, the prospects of virtual reality and driverless cars are likely fueling some of NVIDIA's stock gains lately.  The company's dominant position in the GPU gaming space should give the company a competitive advantage over Advanced Micro Devices in virtual reality (VR). NVIDIA recently expanded its VR reach with new graphics cards for VR-ready notebooks. And the company is looking to its cloud-computing technology to power VR computers down the road as well.   Additionally, many investors are looking to NVIDIA's Drive PX computer to fuel more revenue growth. NVIDIA already sells its semi-autonomous car technology to 80 automakers and Tier 1 suppliers, and a recent update to the company's driverless car SoC shows the company isn't backing off of its driverless car plans.  Can NVIDIA keep rising? There are a few signs indicating that NVIDIA could be in for some rougher waters ahead.  I wrote a few months ago that Intel's new Knights Landing cloud processors might eventually threaten NVIDIA, and since then Intel has put even more pressure on the company with the debut of its deep learning processor, Knights Mill. Intel says its processors are faster than NVIDIA's GPUs.  Investors should expect even more competition between these two companies going forward as they both look to get in edge in data centers and powering cloud computing. Additionally, recent news that Qualcomm might be buying NXP Semiconductors could chip away at NVIDIA's place in the driverless car market. I wrote back in May that NXP's off-the-shelf semi-autonomous system (called Bluebox) poses one of the biggest threats to NVIDIA in the driverless car space, and if Qualcomm snatches up NXP, then it will instantly be a major competitor with NVIDIA in the automotive semiconductor space.  And last but not certainly not least, NVIDIA's arch rival in GPUs, AMD, has managed to gain market share recently in the GPU market, and there's much more room for growth. AMD could also benefit from the growth of virtual reality. AMD supplies VR graphics cards for both computers and Sony's PlayStation 4. Sony could be poised to benefit from VR very soon, and AMD might ride the company's coattails there.  Investors looking for NVIDIA to keep up its skyrocketing stock price growth should keep all of this mind. It doesn't mean that NVIDIA's isn't still a great company, but rather that expectations for immediate returns should be kept in check.  Chris Neiger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

It comes down to the motherboard implementing the C236 chipset (over the C232) and the manufacturer providing an x8/x8 PCIe lane allocation and actually going for certification. The reality seems to be that not that many Xeon users want/need SLI for gaming, hence the low number of products available. But GIGABYTE aims for the X170-EXTREME ECC to be the best motherboard on the market for just such an occasion, while bundling Thunderbolt 3 support as well.

GIGABYTE X170-Extreme ECC Overview Sitting at $310, the X170-Extreme ECC is near the top of the cost pile for Skylake based systems whether the user is specifically looking at a Xeon/prosumer build or otherwise. For the money, GIGABYTE offers plausibly the consumer board with the highest specifications cable of supporting E3-1200 v5 Xeons as well as SLI, USB 3.1, dual PCIe 3.0 x4 SSDs in RAID and Thunderbolt 3 all in one package without the need for add-on peripherals. Due to the fact that Intel removed Xeon support from motherboards using consumer grade chipsets, users who preferred Xeon functionality (either for ECC or support packages) now have to migrate towards motherboards with C232 or C236 chipsets instead. C232, as we explained in the review of the MW31-SP0, is an analogue to the Q150 chipset whereas C236 is more of a Z/H170 hybrid, with up to 20 PCIe lanes from the chipset but a lack of overclocking support. The motherboards with these server grade chipsets are typically, generally speaking, engineered to work at peak rates for several years (and server grade cooling), and should be built as such. This is perhaps why a user would look at a server-class chipset while only looking at standard consumer-grade processors (C232 and C236 accept Core 6000 series CPUs as well as Xeon E3-1200 v5 CPUs). Back specifically to the GIGABYTE X170-Extreme ECC, and this element of 'over-engineering' comes through in design, aesthetics, the functionality and the price. The top GBT boards use the more expensive International Rectifier ICs for power delivery for example, as well as Alpine Ridge for Thunderbolt connectivity, and this is no exception. GIGABYTE was Intel's primary motherboard partner when the Alpine Ridge controller was launched, so it makes sense to see it on GIGABYTE's top line prosumer Xeon motherboard. For BIOS, GIGABYTE has removed the '3D' mode and reverted back to a classic (but HD) menu implementation that makes it easier to navigate. The software in the OS moves through a singular interface, unifying a design ID between various GBT features on fan profiles and monitoring, however external vendor packages such as the Killer networking interface and the Sound Blaster audio get their own implementations. GIGABYTE lacks a RAMDisk utility, which might be worth while for a prosumer system loaded up to the gills. Performance is middle of the road in our benchmarks, given the priority here is stability over tweaking every iota out of the stock performance. The X170-Extreme ECC doesn't enable any form of multi-core turbo due to the aforementioned stability focus of the market, but there still needs to be some fine-tuning, given for example the high DPC Latency. Despite that, the POST time is particularly good for a dual NIC system (Intel and Killer) with Alpine Ridge and other chipset controllers, as in fact the best POST time we’ve seen on any Skylake 100-series or C23x motherboard so far. While we had issues with testing the audio due to the Sound Blaster implementation and USB 3.1 testing due to the Alpine Ridge controller, we were able to source a Thunderbolt 3 device from Akitio with a 1.2 TB Intel SSD 750 and performance was identical to the 1.2 TB drive we tested on a native U.2 port back at launch. Nothing extraordinary came from the rest of the testing.

POST A COMMENT 30 Comments View All Comments SetiroN - Monday, October 17, 2016 - link There is only one thing that's worse than camo: pixelized camo. I honestly fail to understand who in the world would ever buy a socket 1150 Xeon solution instead of socket 2011. Reply dave_the_nerd - Monday, October 17, 2016 - link 1) Digital camo has been standard-issue in the military for a while now. 2) Anybody who only needs a 4c/8t system, but is otherwise doing "workstation" or server-grade work. (Uptime requirements, longevity requirements, need ECC ram for data crunching, need virtualization features, etc.) Reply zepi - Monday, October 17, 2016 - link 4c/8t LGA2011 solution hardly costs much more, especially since this board is approaching the pricing of workstation mobos... Reply Einy0 - Monday, October 17, 2016 - link 2) The supposed advantages are 95% marketing. Uptime is more about your OS if you select quality components to go with the CPU. Longevity, seriously??? I can show you desktops built 30+ years ago that run today the same as they did then. How many CPUs actually die? I personally have had one die, it was 7 years old. Virtualization, again no more features on the 1151 Xeon versus the i7. ECC, that's the one feature an 1151 Xeon has over a similar i7. Now when we start talking multi-socket and what not well that's obvious. I've had these conversations in the past with engineers and developers at work. Everyone just assumes that when Intel says they need a Xeon to do something there is a reason. Yup, there is a reason, they can make more money from the same chip with a Xeon badge on it. Reply HollyDOL - Tuesday, October 18, 2016 - link Yep, you can show 30 old desktops still working, but how many of them were running 24/7? None. Reply mkaibear - Tuesday, October 18, 2016 - link Up until very recently I had a desktop of about that vintage running SCO Unix. That ran 24/7. In fact we were scared to turn it off because it ran chunks of the factory... Reply devol - Saturday, October 22, 2016 - link There are more differences than just ECC memory. For instance i7 cpu's don't support hugetlb/hugepages, and several other 'server' focused virtualization extensions. Until Skylake though, the PCH had basically no support for needed features for SR-IOV. Reply bigboxes - Monday, October 17, 2016 - link I'm sorry. I can't see the motherboard. Where is it in the picture? Reply BrokenCrayons - Monday, October 17, 2016 - link Yeah, it's really off-putting to see camo. I think they're going for some kind of military/tactical thing, but Gigabyte's failed to realize that camo just makes a product look trashy and redneck to people in the US these days. Reply Einy0 - Monday, October 17, 2016 - link I wouldn't say trashy, redneck absolutely...

Anita Borg Institute Celebrates Top Companies for Women in Tech The Anita Borg Institute announces the finalists for its Top Companies for Women Technologists Leadership Index. Macy's "It's an absolute honor for Macy's to be recognized by the Anita Borg Institute," Mike Robinson, executive vice president of Digital Technology at Macy's, told eWEEK. "We've made it a clear and consistent focus to empower, advocate and develop women in technology, and we will continue to promote the importance of gender diversity." Grubhub At food delivery service Grubhub, half the executive team is female and, according to a company spokesperson, its senior leadership and engineering teams are also very balanced. From April 2015 until April 2016, 28 percent of new technical hires were women and 46 percent of total employees were women. "We are thrilled that Grubhub was named one of the Top Companies for Women Technologists by the Anita Borg Institute. And even more than that, we are proud to work for a company that values diverse perspectives—and believes those perspectives help to create a better product, and a better workplace culture," Sandra Glading, director of media relations at Grubhub, told eWEEK. "Grubhub's leaders look forward to continuing to cultivate a workplace where diversity thrives throughout all levels of the company." Capital One "When I first started my career 25 years ago, the representation of women in computing roles was far greater than it is today. At Capital One, we're committed to doing our part to change that by supporting women in tech across all stages of the pipeline," Julie Elberfeld, Commercial Bank CIO at Capital One, told eWEEK. "That's why two years ago, we launched a formal Women in Tech (WIT) program internally to elevate our focus on women working in technology. Today, we have six thriving WIT chapters in offices around the country that have brought women and men together to help develop a love of technology in girls and improve representation of women in the technology field through internal and external initiatives." (This photo was taken at a Women in Tech Demo Day, where women technologists—and some male allies—hack a solution to help out nonprofit partners.) Accenture In March, Accenture published a research paper, "Getting to Equal: How Digital Is Helping Close the Gender Gap at Work," which provided empirical proof that women are using digital skills to gain an edge at finding work and succeeding at work. These skills also are key to narrowing the pay gap and reaching gender equality, according to Julie Sweet, Accenture's group chief executive for North America, who has called this idea a "powerful message for all women and girls." In addition to its ABI nomination, Accenture has been recognized by the National Association for Female Executives five times and named to its "Top Companies for Executive Women" list. Google On its website, Google says, "Creating the right environments, programs and policies can support women in pursuing their dreams and building tools that change the world." It has encouraged female employees to nominate themselves for promotions; it provides women with opportunities to grow and develop, such as by hosting summits and supporting employee groups including Google Women in Engineering; and it has very pro-family policies, such as maternity and paternity leave with full pay and benefits. ThoughtWorks "One contributing factor to increasing our diversity is looking beyond the computer science department and seeking candidates that are passionate about technology and show intellectual curiosity," Reyne Quackenbush, head of global PR at ThoughtWorks, told eWEEK, regarding its inclusion on the ABI list. "Once on the job, we support non-traditional and traditional candidates with training, along with mentors and coaching. This helps ThoughtWorkers find their place within the company and sets them up for success. One specific example is ThoughtWorks University [pictured], a five-week intensive training program for all new graduate hires, which simulates projects and covers both technical and soft skills." AthenaHealth "We are proud that females represent 39.5 percent of our company's leadership, especially when we compare ourselves against our technology peers," a spokesperson from AthenaHealth told eWEEK. "Hundreds of our employees are members of our very active Employee Resource Group, the Women's Leadership Forum. This group is dedicated to making AthenaHealth the best place for women to work and to facilitating honest conversations that improve gender dynamics and business practices." Intuit Raji Arasu, SVP of Platform and Services at Intuit, says it was "a proud moment" when the company learned that it had been included on the ABI list. "We are committed to cultivating a talented, engaged and diverse workforce at all levels, and today the number of women in technical roles at Intuit is 29.5 percent in the U.S.," Arasu told eWEEK. "We have a community called Tech Women @ Intuit that is helping us recruit, retain and advance technical women. Our motivation for this work stems from the belief that the people who invent technology should be as diverse as the people who use it. At Intuit, while we are proud of what we've achieved, we know there is more work to be done." Thompson Reuters In 2012, news organization Thomson Reuters established a Women's Advisory Task Force with three areas of focus: identifying top female talent and creating a pipeline of women leaders; creating targeted leadership and career development programs; and positioning the company as a premier place for women to be. It has also worked with the National Center for Women & Information Technology and supported campaigns such as Sit With Me, which encouraged women to "validate and recognize the important role women play in creating future technology" by sitting in a red chair and telling their stories to men, children and other women. Introducing an analytics-driven Diversity and Inclusion Index this year, Debra Walton, chief product and content officer, Financial & Risk, stated, "While there's still work to be done, we are committed to using our assets and influence to champion the importance of diversity and inclusion in the workplace—especially our own." New York Life In addition to being named to the ABI Index, New York Life was this year also named to the "Best Companies for Multicultural Women" list by Working Mother magazine. "We believe that having a diverse and inclusive workplace is not only good for our company," said Kathleen Navarro, vice president and chief diversity officer, commenting on that distinction, "but it is also a competitive strength in the marketplace. Cultivating a diverse and inclusive workplace allows us to better serve our clients and makes us a stronger company."

On Oct. 6, The Anita Borg Institute (ABI), a nonprofit focused on the advancement of women in computing, announced the 25 finalists for its Top Companies for Women Technologists Leadership Index, an award that will be presented Oct. 19 at the Grace Hopper Celebration for Women in Computing. ABI evaluated 60 companies with more than 1.4 million U.S. employees to come up with its list of 25, which includes all previous years' winners (American Express, Bank of America, BNY Mellon, IBM and Intel), as well as companies in which technical roles comprise an average of 47 percent of the workforce. For the first time, it also measured programs and policies that help make a business a great workplace for women, including flex time, leadership development programs, and maternity and paternity leave. Telle Whitney, president and CEO of ABI, said in statement that the index provides an "apples to apples definition" of a technical workforce and clear examples of how diversity efforts are creating change. "The only way to drive change and improve how many technical roles are held by women is not through popularity contests, but through data, measurement and accountability," said Whitney. The following slide show highlights 10 of the companies competing for the prize.

Supplier Deserves More Credit This chipmaker builds many of the less talked about chips inside of Apple's flagship smartphones. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 17, 2016 at 12:22PM Image source: Intel.  It's well-known that Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) is the sole supplier of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) A10 Fusion processor that powers the recently released iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus smartphones. The chip is manufactured in TSMC's 16-nanometer technology, and according to Chipworks, it even employs TSMC's InFO chip packaging technology. (In a nutshell, this means more dollar content for TSMC beyond wafer manufacturing services.) Although much of the focus in the press is around the manufacturer of Apple's A-series processor, it's important to note that there are a lot of chips inside of a smartphone. None are as high value as the applications processor, but the content is significant nonetheless. TSMC has clearly done a good job of nabbing Apple's A-series business over the last several years, but investors shouldn't ignore the fact that it builds many of the other chips inside of Apple's iPhones, as well. Let's take a look at several examples. The cellular modem (and related RF) Apple is probably the last major smartphone vendor to use stand-alone applications processors and cellular modems. In the iPhone 7, teardown reports have revealed that Apple is sourcing cellular modems (and associated chips) from both Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), a longtime supplier of Apple modems, and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The Qualcomm modem, known as MDM9645, is known to be manufactured in TSMC's 20-nanometer manufacturing process. The Intel modem, branded XMM 7360, is built in a foundry 28-nanometer process. BlueFin Research Partners say that this part, too, is manufactured by TSMC. Beyond the baseband processor, though, TSMC is believed to be a key manufacturer of the RF transceivers used in iPhones, as well. Chipworks says that the RF transceiver that's used in the Intel version of the iPhone 7/7 Plus is built by TSMC, and it's likely that Qualcomm's RF transceivers are built by TSMC, as well. The fingerprint sensor Back in 2015, DigiTimes reported that the fingerprint sensors inside of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus smartphones were manufactured in TSMC's 0.18-micron manufacturing technology. That same report also claimed that the second-generation fingerprint sensors inside of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are manufactured in TSMC's newer 65-nanometer manufacturing technology. At Apple's keynote and in its marketing materials for the iPhone 7-series smartphones, the company makes no mention of dramatic changes to the fingerprint sensor. It's likely, then, that Apple is using the same sensor in the iPhone 7-series phones as it did in the iPhone 6s-series phones. In that case, TSMC profits from the iPhone by manufacturing the Touch ID sensor, as well. The connectivity combo chip The Wi-Fi/Bluetooth connectivity combo chip, as well as the GPS chip inside of the iPhone 7-series phones, are almost certainly both provided by Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). (Chipworks confirmed the latter, and Broadcom's public commentary confirms the former.) According to a 2014 form 10-K filing, Broadcom counted TSMC as one of its main contract chip manufacturing partners. And back in 2012, Chipworks confirmed that the Broadcom Wi-Fi/Bluetooth combo chip inside of the iPhone 5 was manufactured by TSMC. I believe that it's very likely that TSMC is one of the manufacturers -- if not the only one -- of the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth connectivity combo chips inside of the iPhone 7-series smartphones. No wonder TSMC rakes in so much from smartphones In TSMC's most recent earnings presentation, the company said that a full 60% of its revenue in the quarter came from communication products. This includes, and is likely mostly comprised of, chips that go into smartphones. It's not surprising, given how much content within major smartphones like the iPhone 7 it is responsible for manufacturing, that the company has benefited so much from the smartphone boom. Going forward, as smartphone unit shipment growth cools off, TSMC is going to have to rely increasingly on content growth within smartphones -- through share gains, selling higher value technologies, and so on -- to try to outperform the overall smartphone market.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

Reuters/Stephen Lam Apple fans are growing immensely impatient as the tech giant has not released any statement on the MacBook Pro 2016 and MacBook Air 2016. Many of the fans are not happy as MacBook Pro’s design has not been revamped and its hardware specs have not improved significantly with time. Currently, the 13-inch MacBook Pro uses a Broadwell processor and the 15-inch one an Intel Haswell chipset. The Haswell and Broadwell were released in 2013 and 2014 respectively. The Intel Skylake processor was released in 2015 and Kaby Lake 2016. The Apple MacBooks have become stale over the years, writes Forbes. On the other hand, HP laptops have become eye-grabbers even though initially the company was accused of producing boring laptops. In the last couple of years, HP has produced some cutting-edge laptops including the Spectre 13. Recently, it announced the Kaby Lake processors for the Spectre x360. Compared to the Apple MacBooks, HP has constantly kept improving its laptops with new offerings in every launch. It has slowly and steadily been making the bezels thinner. The build material of the laptops is getting better and better with each passing day. HP has significantly improved the LCDs with wider colour gamut, better thermals and batteries. As the editor in chief of tech site Anandtech, Ryan Smith, believes, Apple should have made changes to its MacBooks long time back. “Most models are full price yet years out of date, and that makes buying old models bad investments for consumers,” Smith said. Even Laptopmag, a laptop review site said that “the current MacBooks are extremely outdated,” though it also stated why the upgraded MacBook Pro 2016 and MacBook Air 2016 will finally become beloved once again. An analyst at Canalys, Daniel Matte, said that the new MacBook Pro must upgrade its graphic processor performance and efficiency.

The initiative puts Intel at risk. Servers current circuitry is not fast enough, and International Business Machines Corp. has promised to speed the data transfer in servers up to ten times. The group hopes more companies will be part of the team to improve servers speed. Standard microprocessors are getting faster, but their performance is usually delayed because they need to fetch data from nearby memory chips, graphic chips or other elements used to handle certain tasks. IBM said the new servers and the group’s other products based on OpenCAPI are expected for the second half of 2017. Photo: DigitalTrends Brad McCredie IBM vice president, said that his company and others need to bring new computer architectures and technologies to offer the appropriate service to new workloads. Corporations are also asking variety, referring to Intel and its vast market regarding microprocessors and the technology that connects them to other components. IBM has licensed its technology since 2013, which was exclusive to the company and offers Power-based chips, other markers of chips and systems. After that, Google announced a plan to develop a server using IBM’s Power chip. But there is more; a Google spokeswoman said the searcher also intends to use the IBM-developed communications technology as part of Google’s design, The Wall Street Journal reported. IBM’s new technology is called CAPI, and the group that intends to use it to speed up servers is being called OpenCAPI. CAPI means coherent accelerator processor interface, and the word “coherent” refers to technology that allows multiple components to share a similar pool of memory chips. Those components will be cards containing graphic chips and microprocessors.   IBM vs. Intel: International Business Machines Corp. other interests behind CAPI IBM wants alternative after their servers, which are powered by IBM’s Power chips, declined 34 percent to $1.3 billion in the second quarter of the year, according to estimations from International Data Corp. In contrast, those using x86-based designs powered by Intel or ADM increased 7.3 percent to $11.6 billion. Intel supplies the majority of microprocessors used in servers and has invented the vast majority of the technology that connects chips with other components. OpenCAPI is an advantage to the emerging bottleneck regarding some computing jobs. According to analysts, the group’s approach is an advantage compared to the standard connections that are currently used on most servers. And although Intel’s participation would be significant to OpenCAPI, there is no certainty that the company will join the group.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Ockel Sirius A: Another mini-PC which aims to replace Windows Mobile with Windows 10 3 by Surur  @mspoweruser Oct 16, 2016 at 13:08 GMT1 month ago There is something very attractive about having full Windows 10 in your pocket, and over the last few years we have seen a number of ultra-small x86 PCs being released to the market. Most have been PC sticks for the TV, while a few have been like large smartphones, sporting touch screens and batteries. The latest iteration of this is the Ockel Sirius A, being worked on in the Netherlands and being funded via Indiegogo. Like most of these devices it runs on an Atom processor, in this case an Intel Atom X7 processor. It also has a 6 inch 1080P HD screen, 4 GB RAM, Intel GPU with 4K support via the integrated full-sized HDMI and Display port and a 3000 mAh battery which can power the device for 4 hours of video playback. It does not include a SIM card slot, so any hope of using it as a GSM phone is out of the window, though we assume Skype will work well enough over WIFI AC. It does feature a unique Switch Mode which would turn the screen into a mouse and keyboard combo when the mini-PC is connected to an external screen, much like Continuum for phones does on Windows Mobile. See the pitch video below: The device is already fully funded with 24 days still to go, with shipping expected in May 2017. The cheapest entry point for the device however is $549, where similar Asian devices were charging less than $100, suggesting that this is a deal which our readers should likely avoid. The device does however appear to be part of a movement enabled by cheap and powerful hardware and Windows 10’s built-in tablet mode and cheap licensing for small screens.  As the Windows Store grows I expect we will see more and more of these devices hit the market, hopefully at much more reasonable prices.

These SoCs are expected to be next-generation Samsung-designed Exynos chips, and possibly Qualcomm Snapdragons, which are at the heart of today's ARM-powered Android handhelds. The South Korean giant, which just had to recall 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after some of their batteries started detonating, says shrinking the transistor size from 14nm to 10nm will reduce die areas, and increase performance or lower power consumption. Just like the step down from 20nm to 14nm in 2014. According to the chaebol, whose Galaxy Note 7 is so dangerous it's now a US federal offense to get on an aircraft with one, the first wave of its 10nm SoCs will be 10LPE devices, followed by 10LPP parts in the second half of 2017. LPE means the chips are fabricated with power-performance efficiency in mind, while LPP means the components is tuned for increased performance. Samsung-manufactured 10LPE SoCs are due to appear in handsets in early 2017. From today's announcement from the union-busting maker of self-destructing washing machines and microwave ovens: Samsung’s new 10nm FinFET process (10LPE) adopts an advanced 3D transistor structure with additional enhancements in both process technology and design enablement compared to its 14nm predecessor, allowing up to 30-percent increase in area efficiency with 27-percent higher performance or 40-percent lower power consumption. In order to overcome scaling limitations, cutting edge techniques such as triple-patterning to allow bi-directional routing are also used to retain design and routing flexibility from prior nodes. Meanwhile, Intel and TSMC are expected to start churning out volume-levels of 10nm FinFET chips around the start of 2017. Intel's 10nm Cannonlake x86 processors are due to arrive next year as are 10nm ARM-compatible CPUs fabricated by the x86 giant. In other words, everyone is working on manufacturing 10nm chips for early 2017, Samsung just couldn't resist blowing up our inboxes with another bombastic announcement. Just be thankful Sammy's semiconductors have a better rep than their consumer product cousins. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 16 Comments More from The Register Virtual reality is actually made of smartphones From the HoloLens to the PlayStation VR, all VR kit is descended from the first iPhone 48 Comments Humanity will only buy 47 smartphones per SECOND in 2016 Last year we bought 44 per second, but growth has slowed so its frowning time 16 Comments Masked men 'steal' £250k of smartphones from Exertis 170 iPhone 6s and 380 Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo mobes out the windows 15 Comments Anti-theft kill switches in smartphones just got a little less creepy US peeps now get more control over tracking and remote wipes 19 Comments Mozilla officially kills Firefox OS for smartphones in favour of 'Connected Devices' Version 2.6, expected in May, will be the last release 30 Comments It takes two to Tango: Lenovo bets on phabs, snap-on smartphones Don't expect products to converge any time soon, though 3 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Oct 17, 2016 at 5:44PM Image source: Getty Images. NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock run-up of 137% over the past 12 months has sparked immense interest in the company lately. But like many other companies, NVIDIA's stock has had a series of rise and falls over its 17-year history listed on the Nasdaq. To better understand the company and why it's experiencing big gains right now, let's take a look at what the company does and a brief analysis of whether or not the stock is a buy.  What NVIDIA does NVIDIA's two primary business segments are its sales of graphics processors, called GPUs, and its Tegra processors. Between these two segments the company then splits out its revenue business into four key markets: Gaming Professional visualization Data center Automotive Gaming is by far the company's most lucrative market, with company bringing in nearly 55% of its total revenue from gaming in fiscal Q2 2017. NVIDIA holds a dominant position in the gaming space, with its GPUs holding a 70% market share in discrete desktop GPU market share, leaving rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) with just 30%.  Take a look:  Data source: Jon Peddie Research.  After gaming, the company's professional visualization segment brings in the next highest amount of revenue, representing about 15% of total revenue in Q2 2017. NVIDIA is steadily improving sales in this business as well, and revenue from professional visualization was up 22% year over year in Q2.  NVIDIA also supplies GPUs for automakers and its automotive segment brings in about 8% of the company's total revenue. NVIDIA is also a leader in the driverless car technology space with its Drive PX 2 supercomputer and its newly released Xavier system-on-a-chip (SoC). These technologies bring situational awareness to semi-autonomous cars by using NVIDIA's GPUs to process visual information.  And last but not least is NVIDIA's data center segment, which brought in about 6.8% of the company's total revenue in fiscal 2016. But data center revenue is growing quickly, and in Q2 2017, revenue improved nearly 110% year over year. It's worth mentioning that NVIDIA also brings in revenue from its original equipment manufacturer and intellectual property segment, which consists of lower-priced graphics cards as well as royalty payments from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). It's the only NVIDIA business that's on the decline right now, but it should continue to be offset by growth from the company's other businesses. How NVIDIA stock has performed Historically, NVIDIA's stock price has seen a few jumps and drops over the past few years, but the price is seeing historic highs lately:  Data by YCharts. NVIDIA's recent gains have come from posting strong sales growth over the past few quarters, all while scoring more opportunities in new markets. Specifically, the prospects of virtual reality and driverless cars are likely fueling some of NVIDIA's stock gains lately.  The company's dominant position in the GPU gaming space should give the company a competitive advantage over Advanced Micro Devices in virtual reality (VR). NVIDIA recently expanded its VR reach with new graphics cards for VR-ready notebooks. And the company is looking to its cloud-computing technology to power VR computers down the road as well.   Additionally, many investors are looking to NVIDIA's Drive PX computer to fuel more revenue growth. NVIDIA already sells its semi-autonomous car technology to 80 automakers and Tier 1 suppliers, and a recent update to the company's driverless car SoC shows the company isn't backing off of its driverless car plans.  Can NVIDIA keep rising? There are a few signs indicating that NVIDIA could be in for some rougher waters ahead.  I wrote a few months ago that Intel's new Knights Landing cloud processors might eventually threaten NVIDIA, and since then Intel has put even more pressure on the company with the debut of its deep learning processor, Knights Mill. Intel says its processors are faster than NVIDIA's GPUs.  Investors should expect even more competition between these two companies going forward as they both look to get in edge in data centers and powering cloud computing. Additionally, recent news that Qualcomm might be buying NXP Semiconductors could chip away at NVIDIA's place in the driverless car market. I wrote back in May that NXP's off-the-shelf semi-autonomous system (called Bluebox) poses one of the biggest threats to NVIDIA in the driverless car space, and if Qualcomm snatches up NXP, then it will instantly be a major competitor with NVIDIA in the automotive semiconductor space.  And last but not certainly not least, NVIDIA's arch rival in GPUs, AMD, has managed to gain market share recently in the GPU market, and there's much more room for growth. AMD could also benefit from the growth of virtual reality. AMD supplies VR graphics cards for both computers and Sony's PlayStation 4. Sony could be poised to benefit from VR very soon, and AMD might ride the company's coattails there.  Investors looking for NVIDIA to keep up its skyrocketing stock price growth should keep all of this mind. It doesn't mean that NVIDIA's isn't still a great company, but rather that expectations for immediate returns should be kept in check.  Chris Neiger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Adding these capabilities is essential to a cable operator’s business growth, but the associated requirements for real estate and power and cooling costs can be prohibitive. Moreover, a traditional cable delivery infrastructure rooted in hardware lacks the agility needed to launch new services quickly and cost-effectively, due to the time and expense required to add the necessary equipment and capacity.   To maintain a competitive edge, cable operators need a simpler, faster way to add capacity. The solution must be efficient and scalable, resolving operators’ space and power constraints in the headend and hub while simplifying future upgrades.   Recently, Harmonic introduced CableOS™, the industry’s first software-based Converged Cable Access Platform (CCAP). Featuring software-based Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS) running on an off-the-shelf, 1-RU Intel® server, the first end-to-end Remote PHY system, and leading RF port density, CableOS provides cable operators with three major benefits.   Substantial Cost Savings A single CableOS Core server offers a quantum leap forward in its ability to support tens of gigs of capacity and multiple service groups in fewer rack units when compared with traditional hardware CMTS implementations.   While hardware-based CCAPs typically require nine racks of equipment to support 80 service groups, CableOS allows operators to support more than 250 service groups in just four racks — a 7X density difference! With CableOS, operators can reduce space and power costs by up to 75 percent in a centralized CCAP deployment, or by more than 90 percent in a Remote PHY deployment – resulting in significant CAPEX savings.   In addition to the space and power savings associated with moving RF components out of the headend and into the field, decoupling the CCAP core from the PHY in a Remote PHY architecture enables operators to leverage the benefits of digital fiber, such as signal transport over much longer distances and more wavelengths.   Greater Agility As a software-based solution, CableOS leverages COTS Intel processor-based servers to provide operators will all of the advantages associated with IT economics and Moore’s Law. With CableOS, regular software upgrades accelerate the introduction of new features, such as high-layer DOCSIS 3.1 capabilities. Operators no longer need to purchase space-consuming, power-hungry and expensive hardware-based CMTS platforms, and can break away from the cycle of needing to upgrade hardware every few years to accommodate capacity growth requirements.   Unprecedented Scalability CableOS delivers the ability to efficiently scale up capacity and service groups over time, as well as supporting a range of sites, from the smallest to the largest. Operators can instantly grow their infrastructure from supporting a few service groups to more than a hundred on a single CableOS server. Capacity is gained simply by adding additional 1-RU servers.   CableOS: The Latest Innovation in Cable Access Infrastructure For operators wanting sustainable capacity growth over the long term, CableOS is the solution, enabling the migration to multi-gigabit broadband capacity and the fast deployment of DOCSIS 3.1 data, video and voice services.   A short video on CableOS, as well as a solution brief is available at www.harmonicinc.com/solutions/software-based-ccap.

The biggest thing that was revealed however was a new tablet, the YOGA Book. WHAT MAKES THE YOGA BOOK SPECIAL? | The YOGA Book is unlike any tablet we’ve ever seen before. It takes the idea of a 2-in-1 tablet, like the Pixel C, and puts a new spin on it. Like many of the company’s past Windows laptops, the YOGA Book has a 360-degree “watchband” hinge which holds everything together. On one side, a 10-inch display, on the other, the future, but we’ll get into that later. HARDWARE | The first thing you’ll notice about the YOGA Book is the hardware ─ it’s stunning. The all-metal build feels great and, like the name implies, it looks like an actual notebook. It’s very well-built and screams quality, but it’s not perfect. My biggest complaint about the hardware is the hinge. It looks great, but if you hold the device in portrait mode, something I do often for reading, the hinge sometimes gets in the way. This, of course, is a pretty minor complaint, and that should say a lot about the hardware on this device. Lenovo nailed it. Another thing to note is that Lenovo opted to use microUSB on this device. While it works fine, USB C would have been a far better choice, especially given the focus on productivity. SOFTWARE, SPECS, & PERFORMANCE | As for software, I spent my time, of course, with the Android-powered YOGA Book. Lenovo has Android Marshmallow running out of the box, with a fairly heavy skin on board. The “Book UI” is certainly different, but on this hardware it makes all the sense in the world. Lenovo has changed the launcher to lack an app drawer, but you can still access the app drawer since it’s now constantly docked to the navigation bar. Recent apps also gets a makeover, and a big change as well. While you can press the multi-tasking button to see all active apps, you can also tap on the app’s icon on the navigation bar. These changes make the YOGA Book a viable option for productivity. Further, Lenovo also added multi-window, accessed by double tapping the status bar. Right now this is limited to only a handful of apps, such as Gmail and Chrome, but when the device gets Android Nougat, I’m sure things will get better. There are also a handful of extra shortcuts in the quick settings menu. Powering the YOGA Book is a Quad-core Intel x5 Z8550 processor, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage with a microSD card slot. Despite the heavy skin, the YOGA Book doesn’t suffer from any notable performance issues. I noticed a handful of times where performance was a bit choppy, but overall I was satisfied. This slideshow requires JavaScript. DISPLAY | The 10.1-inch display on the YOGA Book is an IPS panel at 1920×1080. The display is fine with good brightness and viewing angles, but I feel it would have benefited from a higher resolution. Overall though, there’s nothing to complain about. Just because it has to be said though, that bezel… THE OTHER ‘DISPLAY’ | What really sets the YOGA Book apart, however, is its other half. This extra panel has two functions, one to act as a keyboard, the other as a touchpad for the included stylus, so let’s talk about those one at a time. Halo Keyboard This is a 2-in-1 device, but Lenovo has a unique take on the keyboard. Instead of using traditional keys, there’s nothing more than a capacitive panel which Lenovo calls the “Halo Keyboard.” The concept is pretty simple ─ backlighting on the panel shows where the keys are and you use it as a typical keyboard. It has an anti-glare coating and Gorilla Glass 3 to provide a better feel, but the real question is how the typing experience really is. The short answer, surprisingly decent. At first, I had a lot of trouble getting used to the keyboard, resulting in plenty of typos. Over a couple of days, though, I got a bit more used to it. I still don’t type as quickly as I do on a standard keyboard, but I can easily type on it, including the entirety of this review. The biggest reason why this touch typing experience works is the haptic feedback. While this doesn’t compare to what Apple has been doing with 3D Touch buttons and trackpads, it is quite good. Speaking of the trackpad, it’s probably the worst part of the experience. It works for certain small tasks, but overall it’s pretty terrible. Touchpad & Stylus The other function of this second panel is to act as a touchpad, which Lenovo call the “Create Pad,” for the included stylus. This touchpad uses Wacom technology with 100-degree angle detection and supports 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity. Long story short, you can use it for taking notes or drawing. Out of the box the pen comes with a Wacom stylus tip which can be used on the touchpad on its own. To activate it, simply hit the pen icon on the top right of the touchpad. This will automatically open a notepad for the pen which can be used for drawing or note taking. It works very well, but my favorite part is that you can use actual paper to take notes as well. Simply place the included notepad over the “Create Pad” and swap the stylus tip for a pen tip, three of which are included in the box. To do that, take the cap off of the pen, use the hole on pen to remove the stylus, then insert the new tip. Once you’ve done that, use the pen on the paper as you like and everything written on the paper will automatically be transferred to the tablet. The included “Paper Book” works best with the YOGA Book, and 20 refills are included, but you can use it with any A5 sized paper. The pen can also be refilled with any mini-ballpoint ink tip. BATTERY LIFE |  Embedded within the YOGA Book is an 8,500 mAh battery, recharged over microUSB. Battery life was pretty decent, but not outstanding by any means. Standby battery life was good, but if you’re using the tablet heavily, you’re going to need to charge it at least every other day, if not every day. On average I could get about 6 hours of screen on time over the course of two days before hitting 10-20%. FINAL THOUGHTS | Overall, the Lenovo YOGA Book is a fantastic device. It’s a new take on the tablet form factor, and I really like it. This kind of technology is what we’ll see in the future, like it or not, and the YOGA Book is a great start. The company has future plans to add this technology to other devices, including a Chromebook, and I’ll be interested to see what’s in store… WHERE TO BUY | Right now the YOGA Book is only available for purchase from Lenovo, but it should be headed to other retailers in the near future. Pricing for the Android variant lands at $499, and I’ve got to say that’s a solid price for what you’re getting. YOGA Book @ Lenovo Guides Android Breaking news for Android.

(Michael Short) Share Written by Lauren Alix Brown Obsession The Office October 17, 2016 On Oct. 13, at Quartz’s The Next Billion conference in San Francisco, I had the privilege of moderating a panel on diversity in tech with Kimberly Bryant, the founder of Black Girls Code, and Kate Mitchell, a co-founder of Scale Venture Partners. Panelists like these notwithstanding, the tech industry is powered largely by white men, from developers and product managers all the way up to founders, CEOs, and the venture capitalists who fund them. Even when big companies like Intel and Facebook put forth efforts to change their hiring and career-retention processes, change is slow to come. Mitchell and Bryant offered insight into the tactics they use to make tech more inclusive. Here are three that we can all learn from, and apply in any industry sector: Take the risk to talk candidly about diversity Mitchell spoke about the importance of taking risks in the way that we speak about diversity. “That risk that you all have to take, for men, [is] learning to ask questions,” says Mitchell. “I say to men, I learned, to sit down in the communities of color. ‘Is it Latino/Latina or is it Hispanic? What is the right phraseology I should use?’ ‘Is it black or African American?’ Take those risks so that we begin to talk about it … and build those bridges and get it out of the closet.” AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson implied something similar in a recent speech to employees when he said, “Our communities are being destroyed by racial tensions. And we’re too polite to talk about it.” Implement fact-based hiring It’s easy to focus on hiring from within our own networks. But this often doesn’t yield diversity. “[I]f we don’t take this very intentional approach to diversity, then it won’t happen as we’re building our companies,” Bryant said. Even then, there are pitfalls, because of the biases of the people doing the hiring. (An example Mitchell used is: “I might not have asked every candidate the same questions.”) One way to get around this is to insist on “fact-based” hiring, so that you are comparing candidates fairly. Mitchell cited tools like HackerRank and Unitive that facilitate fact-based hiring. Bryant also promoted the idea. “We use these tools in our hiring as well, it’s expensive for us to use this particular tool that we do use [Plum.io] but I want to at least get through the first phase of interviews with some very fact-based, data-driven measures to be able to segment my pool.” Mitchell suggested breaking down hiring analytics into smaller segments as a better way to tackle the issue. For instance, look specifically at your company’s new engineer hires, or at the experiences of black employees who are leaving your company, rather than trying to digest big-picture numbers that often don’t get to the root of the issues or reveal changes. Recognize that there is a time and place for quotas Bryant pointed out that there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution for companies. Startups that are building a diverse company from day one are in a different position than older companies that need to revamp the makeup of their staff. Their strategies shouldn’t be the same. Bryant said: “I think that if companies build for diversity from the beginning from the ground up, that’s definitely the ideal state for how to build diversity into your company. But if you’re a more mature company that’s been around for 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, and you’re still having diversity issues I think a more targeted effort that may involve setting a quota or number for the number of hires you’re going to attract over a period of time is a good solution. I don’t think quotas are necessarily an evil. I think when we look at industry in general back to the ’60s and the ’50s, the way more diverse people like my dad and mom’s generation were able to break into industry was because of affirmation action, because of quotas. But that doesn’t mean we undervalue the quality of the individual coming into work. That was just opening up opportunities to people who didn’t have those opportunities in the past.” Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 17, 2016 at 2:50PM Zero Zero Robotics recently unveiled the Hover Camera Passport, a foldable drone which hovers automatically to capture pictures and video after being released. The device, which can be controlled with a smartphone app, uses a combination of AI, sonar, and a downward viewing camera to capture the subject. It can also be programmed to circle a subject to create a 360-degree wraparound video. Image source: Zero Zero Robotics. The $600 drone is much cheaper than GoPro's (NASDAQ:GPRO) $800 Karma drone, which lacks a built-in camera. The bundle, which includes the Hero 5 Session, costs $1,000, while the one with the Hero 5 Black costs $1,100. Like the Karma, the Hover Camera Passport films 4K video, but it weighs a mere 242 grams -- eight grams below the FAA's registration threshold of 250 grams for consumer drones. The Karma, which weighs 1,006 grams on its own, must be registered with the FAA. Should GoPro be worried? GoPro cameras are popular among athletes and outdoor enthusiasts, but converting mainstream consumers -- who mainly use smartphones to take pictures and videos -- has been difficult. With the Karma, GoPro targets an even smaller niche market of affluent aerial photographers. To match the consensus estimate of $676.5 million in sales for its fourth quarter -- which would represent 55% annual growth -- GoPro must sell about 850,000 stand-alone Karmas or 620,000 Karma/Hero 5 Black bundles. That's a very lofty target, since DJI Innovations, the biggest drone maker in the world, only sold around one million drones last year. Image source: GoPro. The Karma's "killer feature" initially appeared to be its portability when it was unveiled last month. Unlike DJI's flagship Phantom drones, the Karma could be folded and easily carried in a backpack. But shortly afterwards, DJI unveiled the Mavic Pro, a smaller foldable drone which is both lighter and cheaper than the Karma. It also automatically tracks and follows the user -- something the Karma can't do. Zero Zero Robotics' Hover Camera Passport is lighter and cheaper than both the Karma and Mavic Pro, and has a form factor which could be more easily embraced by smartphone users. The lack of FAA registration requirements also removes another annoyance for mainstream shoppers. Did GoPro just get blindsided? GoPro seemed to be so focused on competing with DJI that it ignored the growing demand for "throw and go" hovering cameras. In late 2014, a tiny "selfie drone" called Nixie won the $500,000 grand prize at Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Make it Wearable competition. The tiny drone, which is powered by Intel's Edison chip, initially clings to a user's wrist, but can unfold and take off to capture photos and videos at a distance. The Nixie isn't commercially available yet, but it inspired other start-ups to develop similar devices. Lily, a start-up which was developing a larger "throw and go" camera drone with auto-follow features, racked up $34 million in pre-orders by the end of 2015. Another start-up, Staaker, is also taking pre-orders for an auto-follow drone which costs about $1,200. The Hover Camera Passport seemingly represents an evolution of those ideas, as it turns drone cameras into lightweight "flying selfie sticks". While it's unclear if the Passport will work as advertised, its form factor could convince other companies to produce similar devices which weigh less than 250 grams -- making GoPro's "portable" Karma look very bulky. The holiday quarter could be disappointing GoPro has high hopes for the holiday quarter, which it claims will return the company to quarterly profitability after four consecutive quarters of losses. But there are ominous signs on the horizon. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) recently halted sales of the Hero 5, reportedly due to a pricing dispute between the two companies. Apple is also showcasing DJI's Phantom 4 and Mavic Pro at its stores with big displays and in-store training sessions -- which will steal a lot of thunder from GoPro's Karma. Lastly, tiny hovering cameras like the Hover Camera Passport could steal away casual users who simply want to play with flying selfie sticks without learning how to fly a drone. Therefore, investors hoping that the Karma and Hero 5 will lift GoPro back to profitability during the holidays should heed these headwinds and take the company's promises with a grain of salt.   Leo Sun owns shares of Amazon.com.

Gears of War 4 is DX12-only, meaning the game has been built from the ground up to leverage this low-level API on both the PC and Xbox versions, and considering developer 'The Coalition' is a subsidiary of Microsoft, it should come as no surprise that they worked together on incorporating the technology, nor that Epic Games assisted in allowing Gears of War 4 to take full advantage of UE4's DX12 support. It's said that DX12 has increased performance thanks to more direct control over the hardware, simplifying the driver layer, and allowing the developer to make fully informed decisions on how to optimally manage graphics resources. In an effort to figure out performance, we've thrown not 20 or even 30 graphics cards at this title, but 40 -- 41 to be exact. Because Gears of War 4 only supports DX12, it's exclusive to Windows 10 and sadly at this point can only be purchased through the clunky Windows Store, a rubbish alternative to popular services such as Steam (it had to be said...). In fact, gamers require the latest version of Windows 10 with Anniversary Update and it must be the 64-bit version. On top of that, your system's hardware needs to be pretty decent as well. The developer suggests at least a Core i5 (Haswell) or AMD FX-6300 (in other words a quad-core processor), 8GB of system memory, 2GB of VRAM on either the GeForce GTX 750 Ti or Radeon R7 260X. Oh, and you need 80GB of drive space! Again, those are only the minimum requirements to play the game, so what if you intend to enjoy it in all of its glory? In an effort to figure that out, we've thrown not 20 or even 30 graphics cards at this title, but 40 -- 41 to be exact. As the cherry on top, we've also tested a number of Intel and AMD chips to see the impact processors have on performance. As usual, we've published a separate piece for gameplay commentary, but having been well received thus far, you might say this marks a new beginning of sorts for the franchise. Testing Methodology Our job has been made quite a bit easier thanks to Gears of War 4's built-in benchmark. The test runs for roughly 90 seconds and we found it to be an accurate representation of actual gameplay performance. Since the game appears to be well optimized, we didn't test a heap of quality presets for this title and instead we focused on getting every graphics card we could. The 'Ultra' preset was used and async compute along with tiled resources were enabled. The ultra preset was re-applied after every resolution change as some of the options seem to revert back to recommended settings upon a resolution switch. Speaking of resolution, we also tested at 1080p, 1440p and 4K. The latest AMD and Nvidia graphics drivers were used for testing and for those wondering, multi-GPU technology isn't supported at this time.

Forcing the settings to ultra, there were still distinct differences between the 3GB and 6GB versions of Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1060 for example. The character resolution seemed lower at times on the 3GB model. It was almost like a different anti-aliasing method was being used. The characters would appear blurrier and feature lower textures. The environments would often feature lower quality textures as well, less lighting and lower quality shadows. Here are a few examples between the 3GB and 6GB 1060 models: I admit the close up of this screen doesn't make the difference super obvious, but the GTX 1060 6GB is showing a slight shadow over the green support while there is no shadow at all for the 3GB card. This is easier to spot when looking at the screenshot in its entirety. Here you can see that the character is clearly softer/blurrier on the 3GB 1060. Now let's look at a 2GB vs 4GB comparison with the RX 460. The first example isn't exactly day and night but the 4GB texturing is better than what we see on the 2GB model. This shot shows a distinct difference between the two RX 460 models, the 4GB version is clearly providing a superior image with much greater texture and shadow detail. Now, we're well aware that the GTX 1060 and RX 460 are in no way competitors, so please calm yourselves fans of the red team. The purpose here, since we have already looked at these two cards, was to see what kind of image quality difference there is between a 3GB GeForce to a 2GB Radeon graphics card. Again, they are not competitors and don't occupy the same price brackets. Here we see that the 3GB 1060 provides much more detail over the 2GB RX 460, just as the 4GB RX 460 did. However, it is interesting to note that there is significantly more shadow detail on the Nvidia graphics card, this is also true when compared to the 4GB RX 460. With limited VRAM and a dynamic environment, it's difficult to accurately compare the two and texture pop-ins make this even harder. With the character staring at the same scene for a minute we compared screenshots and you can see that the 3GB card can house more texture information.

(Johan Nylander) the brief TechnologyInternet of Things The Hollywood bombshell behind new, life-changing technology By Raja Murthy October 18, 2016 12:33 AM (UTC+8) Share Tweet Linkedin Print Email Share 0 Comment 0 Asia Times is not responsible for the opinions, facts or any media content presented by contributors. In case of abuse, click here to report. At age 27 and at peak of her Hollywood career in 1941, enigmatic actress Hedy Lamarr patented an invention to protect Allied secret military communications from Nazi interception. Decades later, her ‘frequency hopping’ concept became the ‘spread spectrum’ technology in wireless communication widely serving the world through cell phones, Wi-Fi, and now through ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT). Hedy Lamarr in publicity photo for Comrade X, 1940. Via Wikimedia Commons Kevin Ashton, credited for the term ‘Internet of Things’ predicted India, South Korea and China becoming world’s top three exporters of IoT applications. In Bangalore on October 5, Ashton said he expects “amazing technologies” within a decade; many are already at work. We know the Internet connects billions of computers worldwide. The Internet of Things, or Internet of Everything, connects everything: objects of daily use like refrigerator, oven, air-conditioner, cars have embedded sensors that send information through the Internet. Relevant data is processed, stored, analyzed, shared and automatically acted upon with IoT technology. The DailyBrief Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox For instance, your garage mechanic, car maker and car driver can all simultaneously know when your car has a problem – the car has IoT sensors monitoring performance in real time, and sharing that information. Using the car example, this crisp three-minute animation from the IBM Think Academy gives a basic idea of how IoT works: Cisco estimates over 50 billion IoT-connected devices (Intel says 200 billion) in our daily life within four years, in a $2 trillion global industry. The National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) measures India’s IoT market to be $15 billion by 2020. Internet of Things will benefit everyone directly and indirectly: in homes, farms, road traffic, health care, factories, to ensuring safety in mines underground – as with the Canadian Dundee Precious Metals mining company. With equipment and mine workers wearing IoT devices, Dundee’s staff on ground level have real time information from deep within the mine – including video conferencing with workers underground. Safety, efficiency improved. Dundee quadrupled annual production. Just as the Internet enhanced our lives, its child the ‘Internet of Things’ will do better. Reducing time spent in mundane routines, and we travel towards human destiny that is in the supra-mundane. A day in the life of an IoT family Jared Cook’s excellent five-minute film ‘Life Simplified with Connected Devices’ shows a young family using Internet of Things. The Connected Devices Laboratory in the Utah-based Brigham Young University, has a ‘smart home’ managed through voice commands or a hand-held gadget like a cell phone: The oven starts before Mum enters the house; lights, air-conditioners adjust with room sensors; the kid sister fails to wake up her brother by giving him a good thump with a pillow, but Mum does the needful from the kitchen while preparing breakfast, by turning up his bedroom stereo volume to 90 percent. Dad at office lets in the plumber at home for repairs. More times seeing this YouTube video, more details in it can be spotted to realize the potential to IoT changing daily life: IoT delivers promise of long-existing ideas such as ‘talking’ refrigerators in the 1990s. But now technology exists for the ‘smart’ fridge to announce impending shortage of cheese, apples, carrots. Press another button, the message reaches Mr Family Grocer for home delivery – shopping done in two seconds. More such ‘smart objects’ will simplify life. University of Washington scientists have invented a new Wi-Fi system that uses 10,000 times less power. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) ranked it among 10 breakthrough technologies of 2016. “Besides saving battery life on today’s devices, wireless communication that uses almost no power will enable an Internet of Things reality where household devices and wearable sensors can communicate using Wi-Fi without worrying about power,” said the WU news note. The Internet of Everything is not a hyped, complex babble-gabble; it simply merges new Internet-connected technology to help us more easily, efficiently do daily chores at home, work at office; we benefit from better quality products and services – with a debt of gratitude to an unusual person born in Vienna, November 9, 1914, during World War 1. Hedy Lemarr, Civilization Fire of IoT In 1938, the year Adolf Hitler began unleashing hell on Earth, Austria-born Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler arrived in the United States as the talented movie star Hedy Lemarr. With her eerie resemblance to Vivien Leigh (Scarlet O’Hara in Gone with the Wind), Lemarr was advertised to American audiences as ‘The World’s Most Beautiful Woman’. Her biographer Michael Shearer wrote: “when her face first appeared on the screen (in the 1938 classic ‘Algiers’), everyone gasped…Lamarr’s beauty literally took one’s breath away”. Then Hedy Lamarr became an enigma, a part-time scientist, a recluse. Circa 1940, Lamarr (1914 – 2000) and composer George Anthiel (1900-1959) formed one of the most unusual scientific partnerships in history – a movie star and an avant-garde musician inventing a ‘Secret communication system’ to protect Allied military communication from Nazi interception. Lemarr and Anthiel received US Patent No. 2,292,387 for their invention which the MIT called “a stroke of genius” (*3). “This invention relates broadly to secret communication systems involving the use of carrier waves of different frequencies, and is especially useful in the remote control of dirigible craft, such as torpedoes,” said their original US Patent Office document. “An object of the invention is to provide a method of secret communication which is relatively simple and reliable in operation, but at the same time is difficult to discover or decipher”. For me, Lemarr’s invention symbolizes the yet unknown full potential of the Internet of Things. Nobody then, not even Dwight Eisenhower’s Allied Army generals, knew the full implications of ‘Patent No. US 2292387 A’ granted to “inventors Antheil George, Markey Hedy Kiesler” (Lamarr’s original name). The deepening significance of Lamarr-Anthiel technology became clearer decades later. The online patent document shows the lengthening list of companies using it, from Northrop Aircraft, General Electric to Sony, Microsoft, AT&T and Cisco. The list includes Tokyo Institute of Technology that in 2015 developed an electricity-conducting ink that can be printed on clothes. The special ink uses IoT technology to monitor heart rate, muscle contraction etc – particularly useful for athletes and recovering patients. Like any revolutionary technology the Internet of Things faces growth pangs. Typical of its conflicting young life is media headlines serving both warnings and potential the same day, as on Sept 30, “The Internet of Things Goes Rogue,” MIT reported a hacker attack of epic proportions, and “The Internet Of Things Won’t Be Big. It’ll Be Huge,” said Forbes, explaining an unprecedented networked revolution. I see IoT hope, concerns and skepticism similar to the Internet 20 years ago. Hardly anyone heard about the Internet, including my editors, when as a rookie journalist I began writing about the World Wide Web for the Times of India in Mumbai, and the first newspaper column in India exclusively on the Internet for The Sunday Statesman circa 1996. Personal computers were rare 20 year ago, and even less common were Internet connections. I took turns to browse for about three hours a week in Vijay Mukhi’s Computer Institute in Tardeo, and the workstation of a copywriter in Colaba in South Bombay. Doubts swirled, including fears about the Internet ‘collapsing’ one dark day with data overload. That Internet Armageddon failed to keep its scheduled appointment during the 2000 summer Olympics in Sydney. Just as now in 2016 routine life would be difficult without the Internet and smart phones, 20 years later in 2036, the Internet of Things will be seamless routine in daily life. I call this the ‘Fire Principle’ of civilization: simultaneously born with every historic technology are concerns about its safe use. Imagine if the Stone Age citizenry had abandoned this newfangled thing called ‘fire’ because it can burn, kill people, turn things to ashes. So too the new civilization fire of the Internet of Things. We can use the networked fire for cooking necessities to give life’s comforting warmth, while applying safeguards. The Internet of Things highway ahead In 2015, the Indian government established the Center of Excellence for IoT in Bangalore, to optimize IoT. This joint venture involves IBM, Microsoft, Tata Consultancy Services, Accenture, CISCO, Intel, HCL Technologies, Qualcomm, L&T Technology Services, IBM, Cyient – indicating raw potential that global IT industry giants see in IoT. Already fascinating new IoT products are in the market. Bonx from Japan adds a new dimension to usual outdoor group activities, in team sport like the Tour de France, as in this two-minute video: The Boston-based company Jibo offers the ‘world’s first social robot’ – the IoT version of a secretary, butler, children’s playmate (9). Many more are IoT tools are ready ‘Everykey,’ from McAfee founder John McAfee, the no-more-passwords-key-for-everything. Yet the key to control of one’s life are still in our hands – even decades after the greatest, most sweeping inventions. The choice remains at what speed we wish to journey through our days. Before Google was born, and as counter to the Internet circa 1998, a society called ‘Pencil Club’ started in England with the motto: ‘what’s the hurry?’ The Internet of Things takes nothing away in a hurry; only it more efficiently gives us more wondrous choices – to make the most beneficial use of the impermanent but very special existence called a human lifetime.

However, a Japanese start-up is making waves in the technology sphere through its use of a motion evaluation system that allows athletes to refine their performance and avoid career-ending injuries. Primesap is a Tokyo-based health fitness optimising company, that is currently in Dubai to highlight its products at Gitex Technology Week. Under the slogan that people must live with dignity, the startup aims to minimise the gap between 'healthy life expectancy' and 'life expectancy', by designing and deploying a sustainable well-aging process that fuses the medical, engineering, and science fields. "Based on the continuously monitored state of a person's health, we analyse, design and manage the well-aging process," said Takeshi Kimura, founder and CEO of Primesap. "Our service is not just for senior people aging, but also for athletes' sustainable growth." Kimura also revealed that the startup had recently partnered with Intel to create a motion-evaluation system that helps baseball pitchers improve their performance, and prevent them from suffering career-ending injuries. One of the tool's key components is sensors that record the movements of the athletes, and the other is a tiny but powerful Intel Edison module that analyses the sensor data and produces graphics that identify the motions which athletes need to overcome. Primesap is also working on similar systems for other activities such as swimming and running. He further explained how many of Primesap's models are integrated platforms, which consist of the Internet of Things (IoT) wearables, cloud computing, and big data and learning. The startup currently has two model solutions called Live Trac and Life Trac. Live Trac focuses on helping athletes with their performance, as well as helping researchers in the medical field by providing them with data. Life Trac works on monitoring an individual's health especially if they suffer from any medical conditions. Through secure and smart monitoring, the model can alert a medical expert if a patient is experiencing a medical emergency such as a stroke, heart attack, or if they have suffered a fall. The sensors can be placed on a person's bed, in their bathroom, or even carried with the patient as a comfortable wearable. The system can also alert a physician or hospital if the patient requires emergency medical care immediately.   - rohma@khaleejtimes.com Rohma Sadaqat I am a reporter and sub-editor on the Business desk at Khaleej Times.

In this post, a parenting expert explains how parents and educators can teach males of all ages to respect females of all ages and to recognize the influences that can lead to aggression. It is written by Justin Coulson, one of Australia’s leading parenting experts and an international speaker and author. He and his wife, Kylie, are the parents of six daughters (and no, he says on his website, they aren’t disappointed nor are they going to try for a boy). Coulson earned a psychology degree from the University of Queensland and a PhD in psychology from the University of Wollongong. He has written peer-reviewed journal articles and scholarly book chapters, as well as several books and e-books about parenting, including the recently released “21 Days to a Happier Family.” Coulson is an honorary fellow at the Center for Positive Psychology in the Graduate School of Education at the University of Melbourne. He is a consultant to the Australian government’s Office of the Children’s e-Safety Commissioner and has or is advising organizations such as Beyond Blue, the Raising Children Network, Life Education, Intel Security, and the Alannah and Madeline Foundation. He writes a weekly parenting advice column for Sydney’s Daily Telegraph, appears regularly on television and radio, and is the parenting expert at KidSpot.com.au, Australia’s No. 1 parenting website. This post appeared on Coulson’s website, and he gave me permission to republish it.   By Justin Coulson My 8-year-old daughter recently complained to me about a boy in her grade: “Dad, he keeps on trying to kiss me. Today at recess he kissed me twice on the face. I keep telling him to ‘Stop it!’ and he doesn’t.” Historically this kind of incident may have been called cute. Parents or staff members may have knowingly smiled and clucked about what a great pair these two would make. Today . . . I’m unhappy about this. The boy may only be eight, but he is old enough to understand respect and consent. And he is old enough to know that if anyone — girl or boy — says to “Stop it, I don’t like it!” then he should stop. My daughter should not be made to feel uncomfortable and afraid of going to school because a boy is overly affectionate. Is this where violence begins? Maybe . . . or maybe not. But it is undeniably disrespect. And pervasive disrespect leads to violence and harm. Teaching boys to respect women It has been widely reported that many people, from our prime minister down, think Australia has a respect-for-women problem. Let’s review the statistics: One in three women over the age of 15 have experienced physical violence. One in five have experienced sexual violence. One in four have been emotionally abused by a partner. Men are almost always the perpetrators. Approximately 70 women are killed each year by a current or former partner. Men are almost always the perpetrators. One in four children in Australia experience domestic and family violence. Again, it’s predominantly at the hands of males. Yes, women can — and do — offend violently. They harm others. And yes, these statistics have been called into question by thoughtful researchers who argue that a far more nuanced (and gender-balanced) view may be more accurate. But whether the statistics are on the money or are missing the mark a little, there would be few who would argue that there is significant room for improvement with respect to respect in Australia. And far too many girls and women are being disrespected —- my daughter being an example of where it can all “innocently” and “harmlessly” begin. Game-changing ideas to teach boys better Here are just a few ideas for teaching our boys to respect girls, women, and womanhood, whether we are moms, dads, aunts, uncles, teachers or neighbors. TEACHING BOYS UNDER 5 Example, example, example If we show respect we will teach respect. This means we respect our children, we respect other adults, and we especially respect women. It means that we do not call girls or women names. We do not ever hit or threaten to hit girls or women. It means we listen to girls and women and respect their opinions. Speak kindly This is pretty basic, but at this age, it’s all it takes to show respect. Say please and thank you. Never say things like “shut up” or “get lost” (or anything worse), whether to a child, or an adult, and regardless of gender. Respectful speaking teaches respect. Be helpful Teach boys (and all children) to recognize when someone needs help or feels lousy, and show them how to help. TEACHING BOYS FROM AGE 5-12 The ideas from the previous age group are just as applicable for these boys. In addition, the following ideas are important: Monitor media Violent media is increasingly normal and has an undeniable desensitising impact on those who view it. While most 5-year-olds don’t enjoy violence, by the time they’re 9 or 10, they’re all over it. Sitting down with your 6-year-old (or any child) to watch MMA fights on pay TV exacerbate violent attitudes and model aggression. Allowing kids to watch “Game of Thrones” and shows with similar gratuitous sex and violence does nothing to help the cause. Games such as Grand Theft Auto, Call of Duty, Counter Strike, and many more glorify violence (including violence against women). Some studies have shown that after playing violent games or viewing violent “entertainment,” people are less likely to show empathy or kindness. Minimizing exposure to games and movies or TV shows that promote disrespect and inhumanity can help. Pre-arm against pornography The average age of boys’ exposure to pornography is 11. And we’re not talking the 1980’s “Playboy”-style pornography. We’re talking hardcore, violent, disgusting content that teaches boys that women exist to be violently and sexually disrespected. At around the age of 8 or 9, we must start pre-arming our boys. I’m presently working with the [Australian] federal government’s Office of the Children’s e-Safety Commissioner to create resources for teachers and parents to help with this issue (and in turn, they’re working with Life Education to pre-arm children in schools). Let boys know that pornography exists, that people might want to show it to them, that others might think it’s funny, and that it teaches bad things. Let them know it’s not real. It’s not reflective of what people want in healthy, functional relationships. Let them know they can and should talk to us if anyone tries to show it to them. Keep them away and do not normalize exposure to porn as something ‘all the boys do’. Such attitudes are part of the domestic violence and disrespect problem. Talk about the issues When you see disrespect, talk about it. Ask your sons how it leaves them feeling. How does it make the victims feel? What are better ways of responding to it? Such conversations promote empathy and perspective, and help our boys develop social awareness and conscience. TEACH BOYS FROM AGE 12-18 In addition to all that is outlined above (particularly regarding media and gaming) our boys need to be taught the following in their teen years: Teach intimacy Our sons should be learning about healthy relationships where people love one another and express that love in healthy, functional ways. They need to understand more than the mechanics of sex. They need to understand context and commitment. When there is no real commitment, guys think there are no feelings involved. When we separate physical and emotional intimacy from one another, we provide fertile soil for sexual miscommunication and sexual coercion. Teach consent Based on my daughter’s experience, perhaps I should place this earlier in the developmental trajectory. Boys must know that they should not touch a woman without her explicit consent. They should not kiss her without her consent. They should absolutely not be intimate with her without her consent. Our sons must understand that no means no. T-shirts and slogans that promote the idea that “no means yes, and yes means anal” demean not just the wearer, but our society as a whole. We should talk to our boys about scenarios where they find themselves at a party with a girl who is drunk and all over them. Is she capable of providing consent? What are the risks involved? What if she’s only a little drunk, she gives consent, and then she changes her mind even though her pants are down and so are yours? Consent is a conversation that must be had — repeatedly. Set clear boundaries around porn Let your sons know that porn is off limits. Teach them why. Currently, statistics suggest 100 percent of boys have viewed violent pornography by age 15. We must turn this around. Call them on sexism When I was younger, I regularly heard jokes about how “women should get back in the kitchen” and other derogatory remarks along similar lines. It was part of being male. Well folks, masculinity has changed. And it needs to change more. When you catch your boys criticizing women because of their math or driving ability, or for any other gendered issue, call them on it. Let them know sexism is not cool and it is not funny. Ultimately, regardless of everything that we say, it is what we do that makes the biggest impact on our sons’ respectfulness. What the men in your children’s lives do will set the scene for ongoing behavior from your sons. If the men in their lives think it’s okay to stare and whistle at women while driving, to abuse women and call them names, to watch porn and objectify the women in their lives, or to hit them, the odds are stacked against your boys because of those poor examples. Surround the boys you parent or work with good men. Be a great example. These are our best options. Let’s teach our sons well. local answer-sheet Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

The major averages have spent the day bouncing back and forth across the unchanged line. Currently, the major averages are posting modest losses on the day. The Dow is down 19.38 points or 0.1 percent at 18,119.00, the Nasdaq is down 0.41 points or less than a tenth of a percent at 5,213.75 and the S&P 500 is down 0.91 points or less than a tenth of a percent at 2,132.07. The choppy trading on Wall Street comes as traders seem reluctant to make any significant moves ahead of the release of some key economic data that could impact the outlook for monetary policy. Traders are likely to keep a close eye on reports on consumer price inflation, housing starts, and existing home sales along with the Federal Reserve's Beige Book. Additionally, the earnings season will start to heat up this week, with IBM (IBM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Intel (INTC), American Express (AXP), Verizon (VZ), Microsoft (MSFT), General Electric (GE), and McDonald's (MCD) among the companies due to report their results. Before the start of trading, the Fed released a report showing that industrial production inched up by slightly less than expected in the month of September. The Fed said industrial production edged up by 0.1 percent in September after falling by a revised 0.5 percent in August. Economists had expected production to rise by 0.2 percent. A separate report from the New York Fed unexpectedly showed a continued decline in regional manufacturing activity in the month of October. The New York Fed said its general business conditions index slid to a negative 6.8 in October from a negative 2.0 in September, with a negative reading indicating a contraction in activity. The drop by the general business conditions index came as a surprise to economists, who had expected the index to rise to a positive 1.0. Sector News Most of the major sectors are showing only modest moves on the day, contributing to the relatively lackluster performance by the broader markets. Natural gas stocks have shown a significant move to the downside, however, with the NYSE Arca Natural Gas Index sliding by 1.4 percent. Devon Energy (DVN), Chesapeake Energy (CHK), and Southwestern Energy (SWN) are posting notable losses. Trucking, electronic storage and oil service stocks are also seeing notable weakness in mid-day trading, while considerable strength is visible among gold and steel stocks. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Monday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index rose by 0.3 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped by 0.8 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets all moved to the downside on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index slumped by 0.9 percent, the German DAX Index slid by 0.7 percent and the French CAC 40 Index fell by 0.5 percent. In the bond market, treasuries have moved back to the upside following a recent downward trend. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is down by 2.4 basis points at 1.770 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News The Most Influential Books In Business Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America More Top Stories European Shares Seen Extending Gains Snapchat Parent Confidentially Initiates IPO Process All Is Well With ACRS, First Avastin Biosimilar In The Works, CLRB Abuzz Asian Markets In Positive Territory Japanese Market Advances UPS Strike Could Put Wrench In Holiday Shipping Find McRib With Your Phone Stocks Close Mostly Higher Following Upbeat Retail Sales Data - U.S. Commentary Obama's Job Approval Rating Jumps To Four-Year High Americans Optimistic Trump Will Improve The Economy Tech CEO Threatens To Shoot President-Elect Trump Giuliani Reportedly New Favorite To Be Secretary Of State Major Averages Remain Mixed In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Amazon Switching From Wrapping Paper To Reusable Bags <<Previous        61 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Snapchat Parent Confidentially Initiates IPO Process Amazon Switching From Wrapping Paper To Reusable Bags Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Home Depot Lifts FY EPS View In Line With Market As Q3 Results Top Estimates Vodafone Slips To Pre-Tax Loss On Hefty India Charge; Narrows FY View Merck KgaA Lifts FY16 Earnings View As Q3 Results Climb, Stock Up Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone Amaya Gets Huge Buyout Bid From Former CEO Zuckerberg: Facebook Hoax News Did Not Get Trump Elected Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Siemens To Buy Mentor Graphics For $4.5 Bln Enterprise Value AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet ANTH Plunges As Lupus Trial Fails, BMY's Opdivo Is At It Again, FDA Nod For GILD FDA Snubs DVAX, Keep An Eye On OCUL, It's All Green For BLUE United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Nokia Sets Financial & Strategic Targets; Remains Focused On Cost Saving Program Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Upgrade: Steel Stocks In For Trump Renaissance Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy Facebook Says Stops Allowing Ads To Target Ethnic Groups AAA: Low Gas Prices Drive Spike In Thanksgiving Travel United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars Erickson Says Bankruptcy Court Approves Interim DIP Financing Sumitomo Electric Starts Operation Of CPV Power Generation Plant In Morocco Allianz Group Q3 Profit Climbs; Confirms 2016 Operating Profit Outlook NTT H1 Profit Up, Sales Down; Lifts FY Profit View, Cuts Sales Forecast Bechtle Q3 Profit Rises; Outlook For Year Adjusted Upwards Innogy 9-month Profit Declines; Confirms Forecast - Quick Facts SIG 4-Month Revenues Rise, LFL Revenues Down; CEO Stuart Mitchell Steps Down Konami Q2 Profit Rises, Revenues Down - Quick Facts ANTH Plunges As Lupus Trial Fails, BMY's Opdivo Is At It Again, FDA Nod For GILD Copyright © 2016 RTTNews.

Page 1 of 1. 36 Comments This weekend was the release of Linux 4.9-rc1 to mark the end of the 4.9 kernel merge window. As such, here's our usual feature overview recapping all of the changes to Linux 4.9 that have us excited about the next version of this open-source kernel. Some of the highlights include AMDGPU GCN 1.0 experimental support, memory protection keys support, mainline support for the LG Nexus 5 and Raspberry Pi Zero (along with a lot of other ARM hardware), the Greybus subsystem was added, support for vmapped stacks, and many other additions. Graphics: - Virtual display support for AMDGPU, better AMDGPU GPU reset support, and other changes for this modern AMD GCN driver. - AMDGPU also has experimental Southern Islands support (GCN 1.0) as an alternative to the existing support in Radeon DRM. Similar to GCN 1.1, the GCN 1.0 AMDGPU support needs to be manually enabled at compile-time while blacklisting (or disabling) the Radeon DRM driver from loading. - Various fixes and improvements to the Intel DRM with one of the notable changes being DMA-BUF implicit fencing. - GPU and memory overhead reduction for the Raspberry Pi VC4 driver during 3D rendering. - Sadly, no Nouveau (open-source NVIDIA) driver changes were included for Linux 4.9... Leaving out the recent "boost" patches and more. - Various other DRM changes for Linux 4.9. That's Direct Rendering Manager for those new to Linux that are thinking of the other DRM... Processors / Memory: - A P-State change that can boost performance for some Intel Atom CPUs. - CPUFreq continues making greater use of scheduler information. - Memory protection keys support. This MPK / Pkeys support is finally in the mainline kernel for the new instructions to be supported by future Intel CPUs. - Various Xen and KVM changes for the Linux virtualization stack. - Support for vmapped kernel stacks as one of the changes that excite Linus Torvalds the most. File-Systems / Storage: - UBIFS support for OverlayFS while UBI gets ready for MLC NAND support. - Shared data extents for XFS. - Fixes for Btrfs. - NVDIMM support updates. - Various XFS updates. - F2FS performance enhancements. - MD RAID improvements. - FUSE support for POSIX ACLs. - OverlayFS SELinux support. Other Hardware: - Support for 29 more ARM machines, including the Raspberry Pi Zero, LG Nexus 5, and other notable mobile/embedded hardware. - Intel Integrated Sensor Hub (ISH) support. - New Elan touchscreen driver and GPIO decoder. - Continued Skylake audio work via the sound updates for Linux 4.9. - Mellanox platform support. - The EFI test driver is now mainline thanks to Canonical. General Work: - Kthread improvements. - Various perf updates. - An assortment of scheduler changes. - The Greybus subsystem was added to the staging area. Greybus was crucial to Google's failed Project Ara modular smartphone but will still be used in future devices. That's a lot of stuff coming for Linux 4.9! Expect Linux 4.9 to be officially released in mid-to-late December. Stay tuned for more Linux 4.9 kernel coverage, particularly many hardware benchmarks and of changes in this upgraded kernel, in future Phoronix articles.

For Ultra-thin and light styling Snappy keyboard Long-lasting and quick-charging battery Against Lacks SD card reader Especially thick bottom bezel The original HP Spectre x360 was arguably the one of the most handsome 2-in-1 laptops ever created, and now the company has released a dramatically improved next-generation model. The new 13-inch 2-in-1 laptop brings a ton of improvements, including a new chassis that’s 13% thinner and 11% lighter, a quarter more battery life and an Intel Kaby Lake processor. Numbers aside, the new HP Spectre x360 is practically an all-new laptop, with a re-engineered display and a few features we can’t live without now. But while it’s a hands-down improvement over the older model in almost every regard, a few sacrifices have been made in the process, including a higher starting price. Design We always felt like using the original Spectre x360 was more like handling a pizza paddle than a tablet, due to it being overly wide and heavy. Thankfully, HP has dramatically trimmed the new model’s chassis. Measuring 13.8mm thin, it’s significantly thinner than the outgoing 0.63-inch thick model. The new design also trims the convertible’s annoyingly wide 12.79-inch body to a more sensible 12.03 inches.  Both of these changes stem from the new micro edge display HP has implemented – more on that shortly. That’s more than a half-inch reduction, and stacking it with the new hybrid’s 1.3kg weight makes the device much more comfortable to use in tablet mode. Another effect of the narrower body is that it gives the laptop a boxier shape, similar to the 3:2-aspect ratio Surface Book and Google Chromebook Pixel – however, this device still features a 16:9 screen. Aside from the apparent shape change, HP has also re-engineered almost every aspect of the laptop. The geared hinges have been reshaped into a shorter – and wider – mechanism to coincide with the thinner design. Likewise, HP has reduced the keyboard travel from 1.5mm to 1.3mm, but we actually prefer this change thanks to a stiffer force curve on the keys. Unfortunately, there have also been a few less favorable sacrifices made in the name of thinness. The SD card reader has kicked the can, as has the HDMI video-out, in exchange for two USB-C ports. The good news is that those ports support Thunderbolt 3 for charging, dual 4K monitor support and 40Gbps data transfers. Plus, you still get one full-sized USB 3.1 port for legacy mice, thumb drives and other peripherals. The glass-coated precision trackpad remains relatively unchanged, and that’s no bad thing. It’s still as responsive ever, but again we wished HP had gone with a narrower option that wasn’t so easy to trigger while typing. Oh, and HP has applied its new sleek logo as well – if you really care about that sort of thing. Popping off Aside from the aesthetic changes, the updated Spectre x360 makes a huge splash with new micro edge display that reduces the bezels on the sides of the screen to a much squatter 0.54mm. Compared to the thick bars on the older model, HP has made a huge improvement, even if the Dell XPS 13 still comes out on top with 5.2mm bezels. Unfortunately, the top and bottom bezels haven’t seen the same dramatic reduction, but at least HP is using the space above the screen to good use with a new TrueVision FHD webcam. Not only does the IR camera enable you to log in with your face through Windows Hello, it also provides you with a 12% wider field of view. In addition to stretching from edge-to-edge (on the sides at least), the micro edge display is also features an optically bonded design, so the pixels look like they’re sitting right on top of the touch panel. This also makes the screen a bit brighter, so you won’t have to constantly bump up the screen brightness to max – which we did often with the predecessor – and can save a bit of battery life to boot. Although HP has limited display resolution to only 1,920 x 1,080 Full HD, we can live without 4K or QHD+ options on a 13-incher, especially when we're impressed with the overall image quality as is. Colors pop off the screen, and they’re accurate thanks to it being able to reproduce 70% of the color gamut. Viewing angles are also generous, even at extreme angles, allowing us to read parts of the screen even when just trying to admire the extreme thinness of the new display panel. HP has also redesigned the audio on its flagship hybrid with quad-speaker system. Just above the keyboard you’ll find a new speaker grille, under which are two top-firing tweeters that go with another pair of bottom-facing speakers located on the laptop’s underside. The idea behind the quad-speaker setup is that you’ll have always sound projected towards you, whether you’re using the device as a tablet or laptop. Secondly, it’s the first of HP’s quad-speaker equipped machines to have all four firing off at the same time. Thanks to a new audio boost feature, the speakers work together to produce a louder and fuller sound profile. Highs come out clearly and bass is more present, but even with all these improvements a good pair of headphones still deliver a superior listening experience.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Lenovo Yoga Book Review: The road warrior’s future Vincent Nguyen - Oct 17, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Editors' Rating: 8/10 Pros Beautiful design and build-quality Flexibility of a true Wacom digitizer Relatively affordable, especially running Android Lengthy battery life Cons CPU prioritizes battery longevity not raw power Halo Keyboard likely to frustrate touch typists No built-in 4G LTE for the US No USB-C I’ve been using Lenovo’s new Yoga Book the last couple of days, and it’s hard not to love this ultra-compact, sleek, and versatile tablet with a twist. This isn’t what you’d call a one trick pony, but instead a multi-talented 2-in-1 to help you stay more productive on the go. Trust me, clocking in over 250,000 air miles this year alone, I know a thing or two about staying productive on the move. I pride myself on packing light. For a two or three day trip across the pond, I have a Peak Design 30L Everyday Backpack and a handheld for clothes. With space at a premium, I can definitely say that the Yoga Book has earned a spot in my bag. Design Next to iconic designs by Jony Ive for a certain fruit company, the Yoga Book holds its own with an uber-premium look and feel. Closed, total thickness is just 9.6mm. The display side – which happens to be the thinnest side – is merely 4.05mm thin. Toting the thing around is joy thanks to its even weight distribution; it tips the scales at 1.52lbs. I think the hinge design is hands-down best in class. Modelled after watchband straps, Lenovo’s patented hinge on the Yoga Book is similar to those found on the company’s high end Yoga laptops. Because the Yoga Book is so much thinner, though, Lenovo had to rethink how they were going to implement such a design. Going back to the drawing board, they came up with a new, 3-axis version for the Yoga Book. It’s beautiful; indeed, it’s Rolex-bracelet-band gorgeous, even closer to the original watch inspiration. Unlike the Surface Book’s bizarre hinge, Lenovo’s design doesn’t leave a gap when shut. Opening and closing is satisfying with the perfect amount of resistance, though a fingernail hole to get you started would be useful. Lenovo tells me that the hinge has been tested and verified to withstand more than 25,000 open and close operations. I believe them. The hinges bend forward, backward and anywhere in between, always holding in place with no sag or slip. It just works. The Display At 400 nits, the 10.1-inch full-HD (1920 x 1200) IPS display is bright for most reading conditions. Super bright or direct sunlight does make it a little harder to see, but that’s to be expected. On Windows, the touch display supports input by default and on Android, it uses Lenovo’s AnyPen technology. Using the built-in Lenovo Note Saver app, direct input on the display is smooth but writing in third-party app such as AudioNote can get jittery. I prefer AudioNote because it allows for taking notes and simultaneously synchronizing audio recording. I’ve made the feature request and was told this isn’t too difficult to implement. That being said, Lenovo’s Note Saver app does the basics well, but it lacks this more advanced audio feature. Halo Keyboard All Lenovo’s efforts to shed weight and thickness come with a cost, though it’s one that’s fine by me. Goodbye physical keyboard. By eliminating all the keys, Lenovo not only could achieved an incredibly thin and light device, they’ve made one that’s far more versatile in how you’re able to use it. Above the massive 8,500 mAh battery and Intel Atom x5-Z8550 processor – Intel’s Cherry Trail SoC with four cores running at 2.4 GHz, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of internal storage – is Lenovo’s unique, zero-travel capacitive touch keyboard. It’s protected by Gorilla Glass and treated with an anti-glare coating as well as a slightly grainy finish for a grippier sensation. It’s also meant to help with recognizing key strokes. I’m still not 100-percent about the haptic feedback when you hit a key. It’s not actually localized haptics so you get a sense of vibration in general but not specifically under whichever virtual key you’ve tapped. I’m okay with it for quick use, but anything longer got a little distracting so I turned it off. Still, having localized haptic feedback would get expensive – especially for a device that’s only $499.99 for the Android model I’ve been testing, or $549.99 for the version Windows 10 Home Anniversary Edition. Halo appears when you need it and disappears when you don’t with a press of a button or a touch of an icon in the upper right hand corner. Convenience keys on the keyboard range from volume control, a large backspace, screen brightness adjustment, WiFi toggle, screen capture, home button, and everything else you might ever need – except for a power button. Indeed, my biggest complaint is that reaching for the power button is a chore because the keyboard portion is just so thin. It’s located towards the center on the right hand side, with the volume buttons right above it and the 3.5mm headphone alongside. On the left side, meanwhile, you get a microUSB charging port, microphone, microSD card slot, and a micro HDMI output. No USB-C, sadly, and the integrated WWAN cellular modem some markets will get isn’t coming to the US, which seems a missed opportunity. Finally, both sides get a speaker. Create Pad and Real Pen Without physical keys, the Yoga Book picked up a new feature allowing you to write on what the company refers to as the Create Pad. In short, the Halo Keyboard morphs into a graphics tablet, featuring capacitive touch with Wacom’s Feel technology. With the included pen – Lenovo calls it the “Real Pen” – the digitizing pad is capable of recognizing up to 2,048 levels of pressure sensitivity and 100-degree angle detection. The Real Pen’s cap allows for easy swapping between a mini ballpoint ink tip and the digital stylus, and best of all it doesn’t require a battery or recharging. Instead, it gets its power from the digitizer itself, wirelessly. It’s a comfortable thickness to hold and write or sketch with for extended periods, but unfortunately there’s no space in the Yoga Book itself to dock it. I can see the Create Pad being extremely useful for photo editing, painting, or just simple doodling. The combination of the special Real Pen nib and the surface treatment means digital ink that flows as smooth as butter. Lenovo includes a full copy of ArtRage on the Android version of the Yoga Book, while of course the Windows model can – in theory at least; you might run into power shortcomings given the frugal processor – run any mainstream graphics app. Anyone who prefers the feel of actual pen and paper can get it by overlaying the Book Pad on top of the Create Pad. The magnetized backing holds the stack of paper in place – voila, you’re all set to go. The Book Pad holds a standard A5 sized paper which is available at any office supply store, and as you write with the regular ballpoint pen tip your jottings are automatically captured digitally in the background. Of course, it does involve carrying that stack of paper with you too. In the box, along with the Yoga Book you get the Real Pen – which has a stylus tip attached – along with 3 mini-ball point tips, the Book Pad, and twenty Book Pad refills. Since the paper is standard, and doesn’t require any special dots or markings for your writing to be recognized digitally, you can slot the Yoga Book underneath the pages of your favorite Moleskine or similar notebook, and there’s a fair chance it’ll still support handwriting capture. Expect to pay $39.99 to replace the Real Pen, while a Book Pad refill with 75 pages will set you back $14.9. The Book Pad itself runs to $19.99, while the Real Pen Ink refills cost $14.99 for three. Android or Windows 10? If you’re looking to buy the Yoga Book to replace your laptop running Windows or macOS, it’s a tough call, and depends a lot on what you plan on doing with it. For me personally, Lenovo’s 2-in-1 is perfect for quick tasks such as researching on the web, note-taking, crushing through emails, and even processing images and short videos. Nonetheless, approach the Yoga Book as you might a regular notebook, and you’ll run into some frustrations. For instance, when trying to write this review on the Android-powered Yoga Book itself, I ran into the 2-in-1’s multitasking shortcomings. Out of the box it’s running Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, which lacks native multitasking support, and so Lenovo implemented a pseudo-multitasking system of its own. Sadly, that only works with a handful of apps; many I wanted to use simply wouldn’t play ball, and I was forced to jump between full-screen apps. Those that do support it, meanwhile, are limited because Lenovo doesn’t allow for resizing the windows. Instead, they’re fixed – can you fit three apps across the display, in slim columns similar in proportion to a smartphone screen – which doesn’t leave much room for doing anything other than simply previewing what’s on there. Since Android 7 Nougat has native multitasking, I’m hoping that arrives sooner rather than later on the Yoga Book. Lenovo previously told us that it expects that to happen sometime this fall, though hasn’t committed to a date yet. For the moment, the iPad Pro has the edge in handling two apps on-screen. Beyond the multitasking issue, everything works great. Microsoft Office users will love that it’s available on Android, and there are a few very good video editing apps for short clips requiring post-edits, which support uploading directly to YouTube, Facebook, or Instagram. Indeed, every single app I rely upon on my Android phone worked with the Yoga Book. Windows fans reading this might well say hey, Windows 10 offers multitasking, which is true. If it’s a big deal for you, I’d highly recommend coughing up the additional fifty bucks. Still, there are other compromises that you should bear in mind. Going with the Windows version does require using Microsoft OneNote for notes, for instance, and though it has a Windows-specific keyboard layout it doesn’t allow for using the digitizer when the display is off for taking notes. The benefit to that, of course, is saving on battery life, with a paper-and-pen experience – albeit an increasingly lost art – that can be less distracting than when you have a screen shining out at you. Taking notes with the display off is easy to setup on-the-fly. After you open the Note Saver mini-window and turn off the display, rotating the device to tablet mode automatically disables the keyboard past 180-degrees; then you simply drop on the Book Pad – or indeed any paper – and start writing or drawing. Double-tapping the pen button starts a new digital page without turning the display back on. The system automatically saves the previous page. As for battery life, I never felt the urge to plug the Yoga Book in. Lenovo says the 8,500mAh battery good for fifteen hours, and it’s certainly more than adequate to get you through a couple of days of typical usage. Though the absence of cellular connectivity is still annoying, I’m glad Lenovo has made sure to include a microSD slot. Android does insist on wiping it out before it can use it as internal storage, mind. There’s an option for transferring data from card to Yoga Book, but I couldn’t get it to work; every time I tried to use a microSD card, it forced me to format it. Finally, there’s the camera. Or, in fact, the two cameras: the front-facing is 2MP with fixed-focus, while the rear is 8MP with auto-focus. Weirdly, the main camera doesn’t face out the back of the display as on the Surface Book and other tablets: instead, it’s on the keyboard side, and is designed to be used when the 2-in-1 is closed or semi closed facing forward, while you use the display to frame your shot. Unfortunately, it means that I can’t replicate how I use the Surface Book to livestream events on Facebook while writing or taking notes. Wrap-Up At the end of the day, I’m not ready to give up on my Surface Book and MacBook just yet. There’s plenty the Yoga Book can do, but the limitations of its Atom processor, compact display, and Halo Keyboard mean that – even in Windows 10 form – this probably isn’t going to be the primary laptop for most people. That being said, running around covering automotive events requires a portable machine with a long battery life, a keyboard for taking notes, audio recorder functionality, and a decent camera for pictures – that machine is the Yoga Book. While it may not do all the heavy lifting such as big post-video processing projects or write a 2,000 word review, the number of times I’ve used it during the day cumulatively adds up to a big chunk of time spent with Lenovo’s notebook rather than my previous go-to laptops or, indeed, my iPad. So, right now it’s a companion machine, albeit a charming and flexible one, though Lenovo isn’t going to leave it at that. The company has already told us that it sees this Yoga Book as just the first in a family of similar notebooks, offering something unique to those users whose requirements don’t begin and end with merely typing. The first Yoga Book may not be all things to everyone, but as a well-made and innovative flag bearer it has me mightily intrigued for the roadmap ahead.

A report from The Record, CEO Stephen Lake stated the company will open a 50,000-square-foot factory on 173 Roger Street and will employ approximately 100 people in January. Last month, Thalmic raised $120 million (USD) in funding from Intel Capital, Fidelity Investments Canada, and the Amazon Alexa Fund and teased it will “have new products in the pipeline” that specifically relates to “human computer interaction.” The new Roger Street factory will solely be for its next wearable device targeted to the consumer market. “We are going to be making those future products right here in Waterloo,” Lake said. “We haven’t talked specifics about the products in development. I would love to, and when we can, we will definitely share it. There are a lot of advantages to maintaining that control and proximity to your manufacturing… It lets us innovate on the actual processes to make these things. We think there is a huge amount of skilled labour here because BlackBerry did the bulk of its manufacturing in town here until 2009.” A dedicated signup page on Thalmic’s website hints a new device is coming, noting, “At Thalmic Labs, we’re making revolutionary wearable technologies that will fundamentally change the way we interact with computers. We’re developing new computer interfaces to seamlessly blend the real and digital worlds.” Source The Record Get Updates Sign-up for MobileSyrup news sent straight to your inbox Categories News Reviews Features Resources Contests Contact About Us Advertise Jobs Social Twitter Pinterest Facebook RSS Google+ Instagram YouTube Search Get Updates © 2016 MobileSyrup.com.

In The News OPEC’s decision to reverse its policy of unfettered production and cut oil output to boost prices may be at odds with the industry’s most important long-term trend: demand for what they produce could start falling within 15 years. If rapid improvements continue in renewable energy, electric vehicles and other disruptive technologies, petroleum consumption will peak in 2030 and decline thereafter, according to a report from the World Energy Council.

Starting Christmas Eve, the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul will require companies that package most types of loans into bonds to keep at least 5% of the securities they create. The intent is to prevent a repeat of crisis-era behavior, in which loan quality fell dramatically as lenders passed all of the risk along to investors. Blogosphere Bored? Rainy day?

The 10-nano semiconductor products will first be adopted for devices to be rolled out early next year, the company said. It also underlined that it plans to capitalize on the cutting-edge technology for futuristic functionalities. "Starting from the mass-production in the first-generation of 10-nano process (10LPE), we are developing the second-generation process (10LPP) for commercial use by 2017," a Samsung Electronics official said. "Even after the second-generation process, we plan to use the 10-nano process for a long time through continuous improvements." As Samsung Electronics faces challenges by its system LSI sector rivals TSMC and Intel in the race to introduce single-digit nano processes, the company, which already has leadership with the current 14-nano process, is expected to push for the 10-nano process as an efficient and reliable buffer before it introduces the next-generation 7-nano technology in 2018 at the earliest. "Considering the overall trends, the 10-nano is the most effective process with the best commercial viability for now," Samsung Electronics System LSI Marketing Vice President Ben Hur said during a conference call earlier in July. "We are ready to release the prototype of 7-nano product anytime. But what matters is when to commercialize it." Last week, TSMC said it started developing the 3-nano process. The world's largest semiconductor foundry enterprise, which used to manufacture mobile application processors (AP) for Apple alongside Samsung Electronics, recently became the sole provider of APs for Apple's iPhone 7 and the larger 7 Plus. In the meantime, Samsung Electronics has produced Qualcomm's 14-nano Snapdragon 820 processors as well as its own Exynos APs. The company is expected to produce Qualcomm's Snapdragon 830 APs through the new 10-nano process by the end of this year. Samsung Electronics said the first-generation 10-nano process has 27 percent higher performance, 40 percent less energy consumption and about 30 percent more manufacturing output per wafer compared to the first-generation 14-nano process. For the 10-nano process, the company has applied the triple-patterning technology, which repeats patterning of elaborate circuit design on a wafer board three times, to the equipment it has used for the 14-nano process. "The introduction of 10-nano logic process proved that our nano process technology is leading the industry," Samsung Electronics' system LSI division foundry business executive vice president Yoon Jong-shik said. "We will boost the system LSI business by continuing to secure nano process technologies and provide clients with differentiated semiconductor products." Aiming at expanding its presence in the foundry business, the company said it is working with its clients and partners to verify the design tool for 10-nano process and providing them with design kits. Meanwhile, the company said last week it expanded the application of its 14-nano process technology to the manufacturing of its Exynos AP for wearable devices. It has already applied the 14-nano process both premium and middle-class mobile device APs since early this year. "The new product suggests a new paradigm of wearable system-on-a-chip based on low power technology, integrated modem and connectivity as well as innovative packaging technology," Hur said. "This will dramatically extend use time of devices and realize slimmer designs, contributing to the advancement of wearable devices." yoonsw@ktimes.com Koo saves the day and Stielike BigBang's T.O.P to be conscripted poli...

ASRock Rolls Out BIOS 7.00 for Some of Its Motherboards - Download Now The new version updates Intel microcode and TPM module Oct 17, 2016 12:56 GMT  ·  By Iulian Pascal  ·  Share:  Just now, ASRock has rolled out a new BIOS package developed for some of its motherboards, namely version 7.00, compatible with the B150M Pro4V, Z170M Pro4S, and B150M-HDV devices, which update the units’ Intel microcode and TPM module. If you intend to make use of these changes, first know that the producer has provided 3 downloadable packages for each board and BIOS version that describe different flashing methods. To be clear, if you want to use the DOS archive, save and extract the content onto a USB stick, connect it to the computer, and run the appropriate file from a DOS command screen. The same steps apply to the Instant Flash file as well, but its content must be used from the BIOS’ flash utility. Last but not least, the Windows-related archive must also be extracted just like the previous two packages, and the available executable must be run. However, when using this method you should close all programs that might interfere with this process before initiating the upgrade. Bear in mind that BIOS flash processes are risky tasks that should be performed only by users who have the knowledge to successfully complete the update, and only when the newer version specifically resolves an issue that your board has been encountering. With this in mind, from the links below, follow the one that best describes your ASRock motherboard, take into account all aforementioned aspects, and enjoy your newly-improved devices.

Attractive online gadget deals are back with a bang during festive season Livemint 17-10-2016 Abhijit Ahaskar It is extremely unlikely that you didn’t notice the online shopping festivals on Amazon.in, Flipkart.com and Snapdeal.com earlier this month. Whether you splurged or not is another matter. Some of us do tend to over-think stuff, which may have meant that you missed out on a deal as you contemplated whether to splurge or not. Amazon is now back with the second big shopping festival, the Great Indian Festival. The bonanza offers discounts and exchange deals on gadgets. Here are some interesting deals that might help you save a few bucks. Lenovo Z2 Plus Rs19,999 (up to Rs13,600 on exchange) Amazon.in Lenovo latest flagship killer is one of the few phones that doesn’t seem to have got anything wrong. The 5-inch display is ideal for users who are more at home with small screen phones. The glass back does feel a bit slippery but in terms of performance it has very few rivals at this price. It runs a clean version of Android and is powered by Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 820 quad core processor with 3GB RAM in the 32GB variant and 4GB RAM in the 64 GB version. The battery backup is impressive and the camera better than its rivals. Apple iPhone SE Price: Rs30,500 (Earlier Rs39,000) Amazon.in Apple iPhone SE is a lot more powerful than the older small screen iPhones. The phone’s holds it won even though big screen phones are more in vogue these days. The phone retains the same design language as the iPhone 5s but comes in a more attractive rose gold colour option. More importantly, it runs on the same A9 Fusion Chip that powers the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, which makes it better equipped at handling the new iOS 10 operating system. It is ideal for camera buffs with small hands. Asus RoG (GL552VW) laptop Price Rs81,825 (earlier Rs90,990) Amazon.in If you have been looking for a proper gaming rig with a high-end configuration, you should consider the Asus RoG (Republic of Gamers) laptop. The event price cut makes it cheaper by almost `10,000. It has the typical RoG design— the metallic lid with a skull shield at the top and illuminated backlit keyboard. The laptop is powered by Intel’s 2.6GHz i7 processor (6th gen) with 8GB RAM and Nvidia’s top of the line GTX 960M 4GB graphics card. It runs Windows 10 and has a 1TB of HDD storage. The 15.6-inch display has a resolution of 1,920x1,080p which is not bad by the standards of a gaming laptop . OnePlus 3 Price: Rs27,999 (up to Rs16,000 after exchange) Amazon.in If you are looking for a big screen (5.5-inch) phone with element of a powerful flagship minus the part where you have to spend `40,000, you should ideally splurge on the OnePlus 3. The ongoing deal allows you to exchange your old handset and get a discount of up to `16,000 if it belonged to the high-end segment. If you own a OnePlus 2, the discount will be lesser though. You can still get a discount of `5,000 which is not bad. The OnePlus 3 is more powerful phone than its predecessor and doesn’t suffer from the heating issues either. It runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 with 6GB RAM and offers 64GB storage. Asus ZenPad C tablet Price: Rs6,999 (earlier Rs9,499) Flipkart.com It is hard to come by good tablet from a reliable brand in the budget of `5,000 to `7,000. Asus ZenPad C is a lot better than the tablets selling at the `6,999 price point. It comes with a 7-inch screen with a resolution of 1,024x600p. You get 8GB as internal storage, up to 64GB via microSD card and another 5GB in Asus Cloud storage. It is powered by Intel’s 64-bit Atom X3 quad-core processor with 1GB RAM and has a 3,450mAh battery. It runs Android 5.1 with Asus’ Zen UI, which looks a lot more user-friendly on bigger screen. Apple Watch Price: Rs17,900 (earlier Rs24,999; first generation) Flipkart.com While the release of new apple watches, it is only logical to expects discounts on its predecessor. This deal is available on the variant with 38mm diameter, which looks as big as a regular watch. It runs on Apple’s Watch OS 3 and works with Apple Music, Messages, Mail and Evernote. Like most smart watches it can keep track of the number of steps walked, stairs claimed as well as heart rates. It works with all iPhones released after iPhone 5 (via Bluetooth) and lasts one day at most on a single charge. Fitbit Charge 2 fitness band Price: Rs11,999 (earlier Rs14,999) Amazon.in It’s is rare to come across discounts on a product that was recently launched. Interestingly Fitbit’s new smartwatch Charge 2 is selling at price, you can’t ignore. The Charge 2 comes with a bigger display and comes with a heart rate monitor. Besides counting the steps walked, calories burned and keeping tab on your heart beats it can monitor your sleep. Its battery lasts up to 5 days with the heart monitor on, which is impressive. What makes it tad better than other is its satellite app which records all your progress and displays it on a bigger screen of an Android phone or an iPhone.

(Michael Short) Share Written by Lauren Alix Brown Obsession The Office October 17, 2016 On Oct. 13, at Quartz’s The Next Billion conference in San Francisco, I had the privilege of moderating a panel on diversity in tech with Kimberly Bryant, the founder of Black Girls Code, and Kate Mitchell, a co-founder of Scale Venture Partners. Panelists like these notwithstanding, the tech industry is powered largely by white men, from developers and product managers all the way up to founders, CEOs, and the venture capitalists who fund them. Even when big companies like Intel and Facebook put forth efforts to change their hiring and career-retention processes, change is slow to come. Mitchell and Bryant offered insight into the tactics they use to make tech more inclusive. Here are three that we can all learn from, and apply in any industry sector: Take the risk to talk candidly about diversity Mitchell spoke about the importance of taking risks in the way that we speak about diversity. “That risk that you all have to take, for men, [is] learning to ask questions,” says Mitchell. “I say to men, I learned, to sit down in the communities of color. ‘Is it Latino/Latina or is it Hispanic? What is the right phraseology I should use?’ ‘Is it black or African American?’ Take those risks so that we begin to talk about it … and build those bridges and get it out of the closet.” AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson implied something similar in a recent speech to employees when he said, “Our communities are being destroyed by racial tensions. And we’re too polite to talk about it.” Implement fact-based hiring It’s easy to focus on hiring from within our own networks. But this often doesn’t yield diversity. “[I]f we don’t take this very intentional approach to diversity, then it won’t happen as we’re building our companies,” Bryant said. Even then, there are pitfalls, because of the biases of the people doing the hiring. (An example Mitchell used is: “I might not have asked every candidate the same questions.”) One way to get around this is to insist on “fact-based” hiring, so that you are comparing candidates fairly. Mitchell cited tools like HackerRank and Unitive that facilitate fact-based hiring. Bryant also promoted the idea. “We use these tools in our hiring as well, it’s expensive for us to use this particular tool that we do use [Plum.io] but I want to at least get through the first phase of interviews with some very fact-based, data-driven measures to be able to segment my pool.” Mitchell suggested breaking down hiring analytics into smaller segments as a better way to tackle the issue. For instance, look specifically at your company’s new engineer hires, or at the experiences of black employees who are leaving your company, rather than trying to digest big-picture numbers that often don’t get to the root of the issues or reveal changes. Recognize that there is a time and place for quotas Bryant pointed out that there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution for companies. Startups that are building a diverse company from day one are in a different position than older companies that need to revamp the makeup of their staff. Their strategies shouldn’t be the same. Bryant said: “I think that if companies build for diversity from the beginning from the ground up, that’s definitely the ideal state for how to build diversity into your company. But if you’re a more mature company that’s been around for 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, and you’re still having diversity issues I think a more targeted effort that may involve setting a quota or number for the number of hires you’re going to attract over a period of time is a good solution. I don’t think quotas are necessarily an evil. I think when we look at industry in general back to the ’60s and the ’50s, the way more diverse people like my dad and mom’s generation were able to break into industry was because of affirmation action, because of quotas. But that doesn’t mean we undervalue the quality of the individual coming into work. That was just opening up opportunities to people who didn’t have those opportunities in the past.” Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Reuters/Robert Galbraith If reports are to be believed, the Apple iMac 2016 could be revealed in October and the device is expected to boast of some revolutionary specs such as Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processor, Thunderbolt 3 and VR support. Tech enthusiasts too believe that there are high chances of the Cupertino-based company releasing the iMac 2016 this October as the earlier iMac was released in October 2015. However, Apple hasn’t confirmed any of this yet. Apple will supposedly hold an event on Oct. 27 and a brand new iMac 2016 will be unveiled there. If this is not true, the device may surely be unveiled at the WWDC 2017 in June, writes Macworld. At this point no one is certain when the iMac 2016 will be released. Reports suggest the delay in the release of the iMac 2016 is because of the Intel Kaby Lake processor that has not been released yet. The 7th Gen Intel Core i7 processor is expected to power up the device like never before magnifying its performance exponentially. The Intel Kaby Lake processor will help in enhanced graphics performance and better battery performance. The processor will also provide the iMac 2016 with USB 3.1 support, Thunderbolt 3 and DisplayPort 1.2 support. However, iMac fans may have to wait if Apple is planning to incorporate the Kaby Lake processor into the device. If that’s not the case, the iMac 2016 may also feature an AMD Zen processor and Polaris 10 graphics card. Earlier in October, the Best Buy website listed a new iMac 2016 with Retina 5K display, Kaby Lake processor, 2TB Fusion drive and 32GB Memory, writes Techno Buffalo. It could have been a mistake by one of Best Buy’s employees or the listing was just a placeholder. Even if the AMD processor is used along with a Polaris card, it will still result in incredible processing power and intense GPU performance. The iMac 2016 will also provide PC users with external flash drives and VR support. Stay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on Apple iMac 2016.

With signs of tensions in the UK cabinet over Brexit discussions, the FTSE 100 has fallen back below 7000 and is currently 46.27 points lower at 6967.28, not helped for once by further weakness in the pound. Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investment at stockbroker Interactive Investor, said: After the positive move in European equities on Friday, markets are giving back some of those gains today, as attention turns to Janet Yellen, Mark Carney and the bond market. Both Yellen and Carney have been attempting to manage bond yields higher from their record lows of the summer. Talk of allowing the economy to run hot by “temporarily running a high pressure economy” and being willing to “tolerate a bit of an overshoot in inflation” from Yellen and Carney respectively are having the desired effect in the short term as bond yields rise. However, the key questions are whether this strategy will herald the start of a prolonged bond market sell-off and if so, what effect this might have on other asset classes. Alongside the bond market, the other key theme dominating investor sentiment is US earnings, with a plethora of results due this week from companies including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Intel. With US markets close to record highs, the potential for surprises on the downside remains, even though expectations are low. Ahead of the US financial sector figures, banks are putting in a mixed performance, with Standard Chartered up 15p at 667.1p, Lloyds Banking Group 0.22p better at 52.65 but Royal Bank of Scotland slipping 2p to 170.8p. Education specialist Pearson is leading the market ower, down 74.5p at 758p after a disappointing update. Among the mid-caps Drax has jumped 8p to 319.3p after a positive note from Credit Suisse, which put an outperform rating and 425p price target (up from 415p) on the power company. The bank’s analysts said: GB power has been volatile and is pricing in scarcity across the coming five months. Drax is the clearest beneficiary and we raise our 2016 and 2017 EBITDA estimates around 10% and around 13% respectively for increased near-term power prices and the value of gas hedges. Credit Suisse said an EU decision on whether to approve the UK’s plans for state aid to help convert some of its plant to biomass could be imminent and would be crucial to the business: EC state aid approval on the contracts for difference is key (worth around 111p a share). It has been 286 days since the EC opened their investigation, and the two precedents were EDF’s Hinkley Point and RWE’s Lynemouth; approved after 294 and 285 days respectively. We expect a new dividend policy and investor day to follow any EC state aid approval. Elsewhere Ladbrokes has dipped 2.4p to 136.7p after agreeing to sell 359 shops as part of its merger with Gala Coral at a lower than expected £55.5m. In a buy note Stifel said: The price achieved is lower than expected, but this transaction should enable the merger to occur before the end of October. But Davy analysts were less positive: The end is in sight! It is almost 15 months since Ladbrokes and Gala Coral announced the intention to merge, and the final major obstacle to that deal being completed has now been overcome with the announcement of the sale of 359 shops to BetFred and Stan James. The sale of these units was required by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). As such, Ladbrokes and Coral were effectively forced sellers of these units which immediately put them on the back foot when it came to negotiating a price. A shortage of viable bidders was also a factor given that the CMA insisted that the buyers have demonstrable experience in running such shops. That said, it would be wrong to entirely blame the 3.3 times EBITDA multiple on the factors above. The valuation undoubtedly also includes a discount for regulatory uncertainty ahead of the pending review of gaming machines in the UK. We continue to believe that the combined entity will be stronger than its individual parts and therefore are supportive of this merger. However, the mood music in relation to UK machines remains ominous. Better to wait and buy when there is regulatory certainty, in our view.

DSOA will host TechTalk sessions throughout the five-day event, inviting industry experts to discuss subjects related to innovation and technology entrepreneurship. A comprehensive model of the 7.2-sq-km integrated technology park will be central to DSOA’s display. In addition, it will showcase its smart city initiatives at the Smart Dubai Government stands. As part of its contribution to Dubai’s Smart City Vision, DSOA will showcase the Innovation Ignition Lab in collaboration with Intel (a centre to promote novel Internet of Things developments), the Smart Weather Pole in collaboration with Pacific Controls (a pole that measures the temperature and humidity and works with the subsurface irrigation system to supply the area with the optimal amount of water), the Smart Human Crossing in collaboration with Volkswagen (a structure arched over a pedestrian crossing outside Gems Wellington Academy Silicon Oasis that highlights the name of individual students crossing beneath it), the Smart Street Solution in collaboration with Huawei (a pole that incorporates a number of advanced features geared towards creating a friendly and secure environment for the community), and the Smart Waste Management System alerting the operations and services team when refuse bins need emptying. On its participation, Adnan Al Bahar, the vice president of marketing and corporate communications at DSOA, said: "Gitex offers an ideal annual platform for local and global technology companies to come together, exchange expertise and best practices, discuss increasing trends in the field, and explore potential business opportunities." "To underline our focus at promoting the hi-tech park as a proof of concepts for smart city initiatives, we will leverage our participation this year to highlight DSOA’s projects that support Dubai Smart Initiative - such as the Innovation Ignition Lab, and Smart Street Solution, among many others," he added. Furthermore, DSOA’s wholly-owned Dubai Technology Entrepreneur Centre (Dtec), the largest of its kind in the region, will showcase its offerings and its commitment to supporting technology start-ups and innovation through an exclusive stand. Commending DSOA’s initiative to host a stand-alone stand for Dtec, Adnan said: "We are proud to see the centre come such a long way. Its independent participation at this year’s Gitex is testament to the centre’s growth and success in attracting SMEs, and supporting the entrepreneurship sector. We wish the centre a positive presence and a fruitful involvement." A wholly-owned entity of the government of Dubai, DSO operates as a free zone technology park for large enterprises, medium and small companies looking to set up their offices in Dubai.-TradeArabia News Service Tags: Dubai Silicon Oasis | smart city | More Construction & Real Estate Stories Kuwait to start GCC rail project bidding next year 3,855 access Bahrain works ministry services in Q3 Six Flags eyes $1.5bn theme park projects in Saudi Arabia Qatar to open World Cup construction sites for inspection Empower honoured for new green methodology Hidrostank gears up for Big5 expo Al Zorah to build new wellness centre in UAE Damac wins ISO energy management certification Bahrain real estate remains 'resilient' despite oil slump Oman awards $437m port project contracts Spanish group wins Oman power station contract French firm Architecture du Bois set for Big 5 debut Klampfer, Brayan launch new MEP company L&T unveils key solutions at GCC Power Exhibition Kapsarc named Saudi Arabia's smartest building 42 construction firms win Taqdeer Award UDC plans $329m new projects in Pearl-Qatar Shurooq starts work on key Sharjah leisure project International district cooling conference opens in Dubai GCC project tracker is Knowledge Partner for Gulf Industry Fair First Group breaks ground on 34-storey Dubai hotel tower ACC wins top ranking for tall building construction Reem Mall inks partnership with Dubai Holdings Drake & Scull revenue doubles to $237m, trims net loss in Q3 Cofely Besix FM launches novel training bus Saudi cement sales down 7pc, inventories on rise RTA to build strategic Dubai-Hatta link road UAE unveils sustainable autonomous home plans Eskan sets date for REIT public offering Besix completes Dubai Water Canal work Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

While U.S. stocks ended flat to marginally higher on Friday in the wake of better-than-expected earnings reports from three big U.S. banks and Fed Chief Janet Yellen's comments on the economy, Asian stocks are trading mixed this morning ahead of a slew of Chinese data due on Wednesday. Investors also await the ECB rate meeting on Thursday as well as some key U.S. reports on industrial production, consumer prices, housing starts and existing home sales this week for further clarity on global monetary policies. The U.S. earnings season picks up steam this week, with Bank of America, IBM, Goldman Sachs, Johnson & Johnson, Intel, American Express, Verizon, Microsoft, General Electric and McDonald's among the companies due to report their results. Meanwhile, the third and final U.S. presidential debate of 2016 between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump takes place in Las Vegas at the University of Nevada on Wednesday. Closer home, property tracking website Rightmove said earlier today that asking prices for homes across the U.K. increased by 0.9 percent in October, rising for the second consecutive month after falls in July and August. The day's economic calendar remains light, with final consumer price inflation data slated for release later in the session. The U.S. dollar is holding firm near seven-month high against a basket of major currencies after comments from Yellen boosted yields on long-dated U.S. bonds. In a speech in Boston on Friday, Yellen offered an argument for running the U.S. economy hot for a period to ensure moribund growth doesn't become an entrenched feature of the business landscape. Oil prices edged lower in Asian deals on a strong dollar and data showing a rising rig count in the United States, while London copper hovered near a one-month low. The yen traded weak and gold prices are mostly unchanged amid heightened expectations for a U.S. rate hike this year. The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index advanced 1.3 percent on Friday after sharp losses in the previous session. While a rise in the price of oil and better-than-expected Chinese inflation data supported commodity-related firms, financials were boosted by upbeat earnings results from a trio of major U.S. banks. The German DAX rallied 1.6 percent, France's CAC 40 index climbed 1.5 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 rose half a percent.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Samsung starts mass production of SoC based on 10nm FinFET technology Samsung today announced that it has started  mass production of System-on-Chip (SoC) based on 10-nanometer (nm) FinFET technology, as it had promised last year. It also claims that it is the first in the industry to make 10nm SoCs, before Intel. Samsung said that the new 10nm FinFET process (10LPE) adopts an advanced 3D transistor structure with additional enhancements in both process technology and design enablement compared to its 14nm predecessor, allowing up to 30% increase in area efficiency with 27% higher performance or 40% lower power consumption. In order to overcome scaling limitations, cutting edge techniques such as triple-patterning to allow bi-directional routing are also used to retain design and routing flexibility from prior nodes. Samsung will also cultivate a robust 10nm foundry ecosystem that includes reference flow verification, IPs and libraries through close collaboration with customers and partners. Production level process design kits (PDK) and IP design kits are currently available for design starts. After the  first-generation 10nm process (10LPE), its 2nd generation process (10LPP) with performance boost will be mass produced in the second half of 2017, said Samsung. Samsung said that the SoCs with 10nm process technology will be used in digital devices launching early next year and are expected to become more widely available throughout 2017. This should be the Exynos 8895 processor, successor of Exynos 8 Octa 8890, which is expected to power the flagship Galaxy S8 smartphone that should release in Q1 2017. Commenting on the new 10nm SoC, Jong Shik Yoon, Executive Vice President, Head of Foundry Business at Samsung Electronics, said: The industry’s first mass production of 10nm FinFET technology demonstrates our leadership in advanced process technology. We will continue our efforts to innovate scaling technologies and provide differentiated total solutions to our customers.

Get in here and pimp that rig man.   Thread Tools Display Modes Hex Kitty - Hex Gear R40   (#1) L4mka Member Guru     Videocard: Asus Processor: Intel Mainboard: Memory: Soundcard: PSU: Cooler Master Hex Kitty - Hex Gear R40 - 10-16-2016, 12:46 | posts: 130 Hello and welcome everyone at the next project. This project is something what I was waiting for looong time :-D Almost one year but here it is! The awesome Hex Gear R40 from. Big thanks goes to Nate & Hans for developing this case and for supporting me with it. This project is girl themed - Hello Kitty, so white and pink are the main colors Plan: Some parts of the case have to be redesigned little bit. These new parts will be laser cutted. Cables from PSU will be cutted to exact length and sleeved. Overall alignment of appearance and of course the installation of a water loop on the graphics cards and CPU. Components: - Intel i5 6600K - ASUS GENE VIII - ASUS STRIX GTX 970 SLI - G.SKill TridentZ 32 gigabytes 3200MHz Black - Be Quiet! Dark Power Pro 11 - Be Quiet! Silent Wings 3 - Hex GearR40 Case *Just for info why 970 SLI. Graphics and almost all HW was arranged long before the release 10xx. + 970 are not so long For more info about case, or for R80 ATX version visit the HexGear website http://www.hex-gear.com Find a nice mATX motherboard that holds such cooling, it is very hard and therefore also for me was the clear choice the beautiful R40. Base of the case holds four aluminum profiles, which have a combined 3 kg. The entire case then 15 kg. Case has soooo much advantages and possibilities. Mainly possibility of placing 240 and 360 radiators. Progress so far is none, but as I said, I have a case at home, and all the hardware. I will add more very soon! I will start with putting case together because it comes flat packed. I already started with putting it together     L4mka View Public Profile Find all posts by L4mka     (#2) CrazY_Milojko Maha Guru     Videocard: GTX760 / R9 270X / GTX970 Processor: i7-920C0 i7-2600K X5670 Mainboard: mostly LGA1366 & LGA1155 Memory: 24 / 16 / 24 DDR3 1866 Soundcard: int.RealtekHD on all rigs PSU: lots of them :) 10-16-2016, 15:38 | posts: 1,495 | Location: Serbia, Indjija OP, is this build some sort of engagement ring for your gf (ring would be better choice, believe me) or this is how you plan to redeem yourself after messing up something with your wife? jk, looking forward to see complete build log for this rig and final result.

No this is not as an engagement ring and I did not messed up anything (as far as I know ) We will see if your daughter will like it - as this build is girl oriented and Hello Kitty on the front.. maybe she will want something like this     L4mka View Public Profile Find all posts by L4mka   (#4) L4mka Member Guru     Videocard: Asus Processor: Intel Mainboard: Memory: Soundcard: PSU: Cooler Master 10-21-2016, 22:03 | posts: 130 UPDATE I would like to say that I completed the entire case, but unfortunately I did not .. With my plan one part of the case must be redesigned - you will see in this update.. Case is shipped flat packed so only unpacking takes some time, because all parts are individually wrapped very carefully. Here you can see some parts, screws, etc. and manual. If you would like to look closer here in PDF http://bit.ly/R40Manual . The main frame is hold by 4 aluminium profiles. Each weighing 0,75 kg. 4x M8 thread used for the four large screws that are visible on the front and back. These four large screws holding colored plexiglass and metal front part. Hex Gear logo on the front panel. Plexiglas (color interchangeable - official shop offers a great variety of colors) and metal parts for I/O of MB etc. Plexiglass is cutted by laser, so it is absolutely accurate and cut is clean and smooth. These plexi parts are very clever thing! Holds top and down metal plates perfectly in place without any vibrations. Two parts for the assembly of 360 and 240 radiator and PSU. These two parts are interchangeable, so it is up to the individual whether you want to have a PSU + 240 radiator up or down. Outdoor parts, two of the same include up and down. Large one is the rear sidepanel The main part for mounting motherboard, discs, pump ... Two small long only serves as a cover of plexiglass holders of the same size. The big one is for disks and small one mostly for the pump. In progress! Almost completed but at this point I stopped. I want to hide one tube (from radiator to pump) behind the fans on the radiator. To make it nice and hide the tube is necessary a few extra mm. It was less then 10 mm, but I want be sure and have more space for maybe another combination.. Quick render of new part .. I will be lasercutting more parts for this project, but about them in next updates!     L4mka View Public Profile Find all posts by L4mka     (#5) L4mka Member Guru     Videocard: Asus Processor: Intel Mainboard: Memory: Soundcard: PSU: Cooler Master 11-07-2016, 20:02 | posts: 130 UPDATE To lasercut the new parts I had to wait a little longer than usual, but here it is The first part is the upper part of the casefor mounting the radiator 240 (displacement of 10 mm) and installation for PSU. Redrawing the part takes a long time, but the reward is sweet - everything fits exactly Another part is an holder for mounting DDC pumps . And I made few pcs more for future projects HEX-GEAR project so that hexagons should be everywhere! And now for the installation of a new piece, which was seamless because the outer dimensions are identical to the original. The only change is the 10 mm offset of radiator and two openings for possible wiring - hexagons As always highquality Bitspower watercooling. Biggest thanks goes to BP team!! CPU block DDC pump in a combo with reservoir Radiators are Touchaqua = another brand from Bitspower. Bridge to connect two blocks of graphics cards. It is set up as a series connection as well as parallel.     L4mka View Public Profile Find all posts by L4mka   (#6) L4mka Member Guru     Videocard: Asus Processor: Intel Mainboard: Memory: Soundcard: PSU: Cooler Master 11-07-2016, 20:02 | posts: 130 Some fittings for this pink beast. Not all, just few from every type. Adapters for easy bending. I always think about bending. "I will finally do bends!" but in previous projects I always choose angled fittings and no bends..

Photo: Priyanka Parashar/Mint Steve Jobs once said, “To me, ideas are worth nothing unless executed. They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth millions.” Jobs’ comment has been recounted by many over the years, to emphasize the fact that ideas are cheap, and what really matters is execution. More significantly, it underscores the fact that entrepreneurial ideas are abundant and commonplace, but entrepreneurs who can execute the ideas in the face of difficult odds are few and uncommon. As such, the smart money should be on the entrepreneur, rather than the idea. Bet on the jockey, not the horse. Decades ago, Harvard University’s William Sahlman wrote about this issue, emphasizing that the entrepreneur and the start-up team is more relevant than the business idea. “When I receive a business plan, I always read the résumé section first,” he said. According to him, without the right team, none of the other elements of the start-up matter. Famed venture capitalist Arthur Rock, whose investments include Apple and Intel, had similar sentiments: “I invest in people, not ideas”. He further explained: “If you can find good people, if they are wrong about the product, they’ll make a switch, so what good is it to understand the product that they are making in the first place?” These remarks make a strong case for a focus on the entrepreneur and the team, when evaluating a start-up. However, is there empirical evidence for this? A recent research study on angel investors, conducted by Stanford University’s Shai Bernstein, University of Southern California’s Arthur Korteweg, and Kevin Laws, chief operations officer of AngelList, provides the first relevant evidence on this topic. This study is particularly valuable because it focuses on angel investors, and they fund many more start-ups than venture capitalists. In fact, in the US, they fund more than 15 times as many start-ups as venture capitalists. The study focuses on identifying the specific start-up characteristics that are important to investors in early-stage firms. The results reveal that the average investor responds more strongly to information about the founding team than marketplace evidence such as customer demand. Equally important, the researchers show that investing based on team information is a rational strategy for early-stage investors. The obvious next question is, if you are going to bet on the entrepreneur and the team, how do you pick the right entrepreneur? What characteristics of an entrepreneur indicate future success for the start-up? The University of Virginia’s Saras Sarasvathy’s research provides interesting insights that address this question. For starters, the approach that characterizes successful early-stage entrepreneurs is very different from those of successful managers. In fact, the successful entrepreneurs’ approach early in their ventures is often contradictory to that of a successful manager. According to Sarasvathy, in established businesses, the typical manager is asked to focus on clearly defined goals, and is expected to identify and select the best means to achieve the goals. Thus, for a predetermined goal, the manager attempts to find the optimal alternative to achieve it—be it based on efficiency, speed, cost, or other criteria. In sharp contrast, the successful entrepreneur begins with a given set of means, and the goal emerges over time, based on interactions with the marketplace, potential customers and experts, as well as on the team’s imagination and creativity. The ultimate entrepreneurial goal that emerges is also influenced by the aspirations of the entrepreneur (a grand vision, or a less ambitious one?), and how the entrepreneur responds to the steps and missteps, and twists and turns, that are part of the journey. The managerial approach is termed “causal thinking”, and the entrepreneurial approach, “effectual thinking”. The premise of causal thinking is that if we can predict the future, we can control it. This has led to enormous amounts of time and money spent on research and books on predictive models, and courses on predictive modelling for MBA and executive programmes. In contrast, the premise of effectual thinking is that if we can make our future, by creating our own markets, we control it, and thus, there is no need to predict it. The early-stage entrepreneurs you should bet on are those who are effectual thinkers—those who see and create a new future, rather than causal thinkers who see the future as a continuation of the past. Such entrepreneurs recognize that their start-up is the beginning of the journey that will require inputs from various stakeholders, as well as their own innovative and imaginative inputs, to ultimately provide clarity to the goal that the venture will work towards. Best-selling author and professor John Mullins reiterates this point: “For entrepreneurs it is not about (stubbornly) thinking that one has a brilliant idea and trying to figure out how this particular idea can be successful, but about acknowledging uncertainty and embracing the need to adapt the initial idea until it works out. Entrepreneurs should emphasize ‘business discovering’ and de-emphasize ‘business planning’.” As the early start-up grows and matures, the best entrepreneurs will recognize the need to transition from an effectual bent of thinking to the causal approach of managerial thinking. Thus, the ideal entrepreneur to bet on is the jockey who can wear both hats, and has the insight to know when to remove one, and don the other.

Microsoft HoloLens eyes enterprise adoption amid crowded field Microsoft is positioning its HoloLens augmented reality headset for businesses, but analysts say it must clear hurdles such as cost, technical and competitive challenges. Clint Boulton (CIO (US)) on 15 October, 2016 01:42 0 - - - - print email Microsoft has enlisted the likes of Volvo, Lowes, Japan Airlines and ThyssenKrupp to test its HoloLens augmented reality (AR) headset, underscoring the software giant’s early success in wooing enterprises. Given Microsoft's prowess in fostering dominant platforms such as Windows and Office and its global reach you could argue that the software giant has the best shot at establishing the enterprise standard in AR. Gartner analyst Brian Blau, who tracks the AR/VR market, is taking a cautious view. He says that while Microsoft’s clout in business software give it an advantage it’s too early to proclaim a leader. Microsoft’s AR device, currently available to developers and businesses, costs $3,000, has some technical limitations and faces competition from a number of tech heavyweights that are building wearable AR and virtual reality ecosystems. Volvo sees a day when consumers will use Microsoft HoloLens to customize their cars in a virtual showroom. HoloLens, which vies with Oculus Rift, Samsung Gear, Sony Playstation VR and dozens of others in the high-stakes market for immersive headsets, uses cameras, air gestures, gaze, voice , and sound to navigate holograms that adapt to the physical surroundings, enabling people to access information and complete tasks hands-free. Thyssenkrupp technicians access Skype on HoloLens to call subject matter experts and share holographic instructions. HoloLens lures many business takers Attracted by the opportunity to enable employees to access information and complete tasks hands-free, several companies are building HoloLens applications. A handful include the following: Thyssenkrupp elevator service technicians use HoloLens to triage service requests ahead of maintenance visits and getting hands-free remote guidance when on site. Technicians access Skype on HoloLens to call subject matter experts and share holographic instructions In trials, Thyssenkrupp says HoloLens has reduced the average length of it service calls by four times. Volvo Cars envisions consumers using HoloLens to customize their cars in a virtual showroom. “Imagine using mixed reality to choose the type of car you want – to explore the colors, rims , or get a better understanding of the features, services and options available,” says Björn Annwall, Volvo’s senior vice president of marketing, sales and service. He says that HoloLens could open up new sales channels by allowing dealers to take a car configurator to pop-up stores or malls. Japan Airlines (JAL) has developed two proof-of-concept programs to train engine mechanics and flight crew trainees. Thanks to the 3D capabilities in HoloLens mechanics “can study and be trained just as if they were working on the actual engine or cockpit,” placing their hands on virtual engines and parts, says Koji Hayamizu, senior director of the planning group for JAL’s products and service administration department. Using HoloLens, flight crew trainees access a detailed hologram that will display cockpit devices and switches that they can operate themselves, with visual and voice guidance. Lowe’s customers are using HoloLensto view a holographic representation of a new kitchen and customize design options for kitchen cabinetry, countertops, appliances and other home features. They may also share their designs online. “A miniature hologram kitchen allows for a bird’s eye perspective of the kitchen,” says Microsoft’s Erickson. In-store designers and friends can view what the customer is seeing and changing in real time through a hand-held Surface tablet. Microsoft also is working with AECOM and Trimble Navigation to allow architects and engineers to view building construction and engineering schemas in 3D. AECOM says engineers and designers in London, Hong Kong and Denver, are exploring 3D buildings as if they were physical models on a table. Healthy skepticism abounds Such commercial scenarios underscore why Microsoft is confident in its ability to make HoloLens the VR standard for commercial industry. And the currently modest market for AR/VR devices is set to boom. Forrester Research estimates that 52million units of VR head-mounted displays will be used by enterprises and by consumers use in the U.S. by 2020. AECOM engineers and designers in London, Hong Kong and Denver are exploring 3D buildings as if they were physical models. But analysts aren’t ready to proclaim HoloLens as the go-to device for enterprises. Forrester analyst J.P. Gownder says that while HoloLens is an important device, it has several limitations, including its $3,000 price tag. It’s also heavy – you won’t want to wear it for more than two hours. It also has a narrow field of view and can’t be used outside in bright light. However, Gownder expects Windows Holographic will eventually lead to new form factors. “I would be looking to new Windows Holographic devices from Microsoft's partners that solve those problems,” Gownder says. Gartner’s Blau says a new collaboration between Microsoft and Intel raises questions about HoloLens’ future. Last month, Intel unveiled Project Alloy, the chipmaker’s bid to create an all-in-one VR display that is similar to HoloLens. Microsoft agreed to optimize Windows content and experiences in Intel’s Alloy device and the two companies will help foster a range of AR/VR devices for business and consumer markets. “We don’t know if that is the future of HoloLens, if HoloLens gets merged into whatever Project Alloy is,” Blau says. Microsoft is expected to unveil more details about its collaboration with Intel, as well as OEM partnerships, at WinHEC in December. What Blau is certain of is that AR/VR leaders will include global ecosystem vendors, such as Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook and Samsung, which have cultivated platforms in mobile, cloud, social and other key technology categories. “The same [ecosystem phenomenon] is going to happen in immersive technology,” Blau says. Microsoft, which , added mobile device management, Azure Active Directory support, BitLocker data encryption and VPN remote access , to make HoloLens more appealing to enterprises, remains confident in its position. “HoloLens is on a multi-year journey and we are currently focused on developers and enterprise scenarios,” Scott Erickson, general manager of Microsoft HoloLens, tells CIO.com via email.

Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley, as well as Netflix, Microsoft, General Electric and Intel are among the US companies scheduled to report their latest quarterly earnings in the coming days. "At the end of the day, it really is all about earnings," Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Investment Management in New York, told Reuters. “Every economic data point filters down into earnings.” Investors will gauge US economic performance through reports on the Empire State manufacturing survey, and industrial production, due to be released today; consumer price index, and the housing market index, due Tuesday; housing starts, and Atlanta Fed business expectations, due Wednesday; as well as weekly jobless claims, Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey, existing home sales, and leading indications, due Thursday. The Federal Reserve releases its Beige Book on Wednesday. Last Friday’s speech by Fed Chair Janet Yellen did little to change bets that the central bank will raise interest rates in December. Policy makers scheduled to speak this week include Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer today, San Francisco Fed President John Williams and Dallas Fed’s Rob Kaplan on Wednesday, New York Fed’s William Dudley on Thursday, and Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo on Friday. “The domestic numbers are going to be important for the Fed, that’s what they care about, and they continue to line up nicely for a Fed rate hike,” Matt Maley, an equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co in New York, told Bloomberg. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6 percent, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index retreated 1 percent and the Nasdaq Composite Index shed 1.5 percent. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index rose 1.3 percent last Friday, posting a 0.1 percent advance for the week. On Thursday, a meeting of European Central Bank policymakers and a subsequent press conference by President Mario Draghi will be scrutinised for any clues about plans to change—whether extend or taper—its asset purchase program. Also on Thursday, European Union leaders gather for a two-day summit in Brussels, which might offer further details on the Brexit negotiations—a new key barometer for the British pound. “It’s one thing to try and model an economic outlook, but when we’re trying to work out what the politicians are going to do, it’s impossible,” Jane Foley, a senior currency strategist at Rabobank International in London, told Bloomberg. “Therefore it’s very likely that we’ll have markets reacting to headline news and we’ll have volatility. The warnings about Brexit are coming to fruition, and [last] week has marked a sea change in market sentiment.” China’s third-quarter GDP report, due Wednesday, will also be watched closely as concern about the country’s economy resurfaced. “Growth on our China Activity Proxy—which we think is a more reliable measure of economic activity than the official [GDP] figures—points to a sharper rebound last quarter, said Capital Economics' Chang Liu said in a note, forecasting that year-on-year growth rose to about 5.0 percent, up from 4.4 percent in the second quarter.

Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley, as well as Netflix, Microsoft, General Electric and Intel are among the US companies scheduled to report their latest quarterly earnings in the coming days. “At the end of the day, it really is all about earnings,” Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Investment Management in New York, told Reuters. “Every economic data point filters down into earnings.” Investors will gauge US economic performance through reports on the Empire State manufacturing survey, and industrial production, due to be released today; consumer price index, and the housing market index, due Tuesday; housing starts, and Atlanta Fed business expectations, due Wednesday; as well as weekly jobless claims, Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey, existing home sales, and leading indications, due Thursday. The Federal Reserve releases its Beige Book on Wednesday. Last Friday’s speech by Fed Chair Janet Yellen did little to change bets that the central bank will raise interest rates in December. Policy makers scheduled to speak this week include Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer today, San Francisco Fed President John Williams and Dallas Fed’s Rob Kaplan on Wednesday, New York Fed’s William Dudley on Thursday, and Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo on Friday. “The domestic numbers are going to be important for the Fed, that’s what they care about, and they continue to line up nicely for a Fed rate hike,” Matt Maley, an equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co in New York, told Bloomberg. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6 percent, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index retreated 1 percent and the Nasdaq Composite Index shed 1.5 percent. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index rose 1.3 percent last Friday, posting a 0.1 percent advance for the week. On Thursday, a meeting of European Central Bank policymakers and a subsequent press conference by President Mario Draghi will be scrutinised for any clues about plans to change—whether extend or taper—its asset purchase program. Also on Thursday, European Union leaders gather for a two-day summit in Brussels, which might offer further details on the Brexit negotiations—a new key barometer for the British pound. “It’s one thing to try and model an economic outlook, but when we’re trying to work out what the politicians are going to do, it’s impossible,” Jane Foley, a senior currency strategist at Rabobank International in London, told Bloomberg. “Therefore it’s very likely that we’ll have markets reacting to headline news and we’ll have volatility. The warnings about Brexit are coming to fruition, and [last] week has marked a sea change in market sentiment.” China’s third-quarter GDP report, due Wednesday, will also be watched closely as concern about the country’s economy resurfaced. “Growth on our China Activity Proxy—which we think is a more reliable measure of economic activity than the official [GDP] figures—points to a sharper rebound last quarter, said Capital Economics’ Chang Liu said in a note, forecasting that year-on-year growth rose to about 5.0 percent, up from 4.4 percent in the second quarter.

The UAE continues to be the gateway between East and the West, as seen by the large number of international participants at the 36th edition of Gitex Technology Week in Dubai on Sunday. This was stated by Shaikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of Dubai Executive Council, while opening the five-day event at the Dubai World Trade Centre. The large number of local participants also reflects a shift in thinking, innovation and performance which will empower the UAE's shift to smart government, enhance innovation in all sectors and help transform the UAE into the fastest growing and the happiest country in the world, Shaikh Hamdan said. Around 4,000 exhibitors from 60 countries are showcasing the latest technologies at Gitex, the largest technology exchange and marketplace for the Middle East and Africa.   Startups at Gitex Accompanied by Shaikh Maktoum bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Deputy Ruler of Dubai, and senior officials, Shaikh Hamdan toured the exhibition. He also stopped at the stands of participating global technology corporations including Samsung, Microsoft, Dell EMC, Intel, pavilions of Nigeria and Germany, as well as local government entities such as Smart Dubai. Dubai hosted the launch of the world's first, most global, week-long startup showcase at the Gitex Technology Week. Among the more than 410 startups from nearly 60 countries, more than half are making their global debut at the Gitex Global Startup Movement. The diversity of the Gitex Global Startup Movement - both in terms of its international attendance of and the industry and development of the startups - is a key differentiator for the movement Held in response to the need for an industry hub for investors, incubators, and accelerators to identify the world's next great startups and support youth empowerment, the new Gitex Global Startup Movement is a comprehensive and dynamic technology platform that will promote global knowledge exchange, foster economic growth and encourage startup investment in the region. An early adopter of technology, with a 95 per cent household internet penetration, the UAE is a hotbed for technology innovation. Young entrepreneurs and startups have the potential to contribute significantly to employment opportunities for this class of fresh graduates. Digital entrepreneurs are expected to add $14 billion to the UAE's GDP, and $1.5 trillion to global GDP by 2020, according to recent reports from the consultancy Accenture. Many innovative startups have already experienced success in the UAE including UAE-born ventures such as car booking service Careem, package delivery app Fetchr, and online shopping platform Souq.com. "The UAE is the perfect place for technology-based startups to grow. At the Gitex Global Startup Movement, startups can benefit from fundraising from across emerging market investors who are eager for new innovations," said Mudasir Sheikha, co-founder of Careem. Other innovative startups showcasing at the Gitex Global Startup Movement include Be Happy, Be Healthy from Germany, the energy medicine of the future; Bulbul, which is India's first travel app for children; and iCare from the UAE, which is the world's first blood bank mobile app; and JustPrice.pk, Pakistan's fastest-growing mobile retail platform. - abdulbasit@khaleejtimes.com Share More > Vote MORE FROM Technology Technology Japanese start-up brings medical technology to...

Here is a synopsis of the seven ballot issues: Measure 97: Story continues below video × Measure 97 is receiving the most press and political advertising as it is the most contentious and difficult to ferret out which side is telling the truth. The measure would raise corporate income taxes on businesses with annual incomes that exceed $25 million. Firms doing business in Oregon such as Intel, Facebook, and Nike fall into these categories as well as large grocery chains, such as Albertson’s. Oregon businesses with sales under $25 million would not be affected. Money generated from the tax would provide additional funding for education, healthcare and services for senior citizens. However, opponents note that the money would initially be allocated to the state’s general fund, meaning the legislature could redirect money to help the Public Employees Retirement System, which is swimming in billions of dollars in debt. Opponents also claim it is a hidden sales tax, as in any tax placed on a large corporation will be passed on to its customers. Further, it would discourage outside corporations from locating in Oregon. According to observers, Phillips 66, Comcast and the Automobile Dealers Association of Portland are the top three contributing opponents to efforts to defeat the measure. Supporters include public and private unions, education associations, labor commissioner and Secretary of State candidate Brad Avakian, as well as several state representatives. Education officials have estimated it could mean from $1 million to $2 million for Klamath and Lake school districts. (See the local Pros and Cons to this issue, Page A7) Measure 94: Measure 94 eliminates mandatory retirement age for judges. Currently, a state judge must retire from office at the end of a calendar year when the judge reaches age 75. The measure removes this requirement. The measure also removed the provision allowing the Legislature or voters to establish a statutory, mandatory retirement age for judges. There are no costs associated with the measure, the Secretary of State’s office said. Measure 96: Measure 96 allocates 1.5 percent of state lottery revenues to Oregon veterans. Lottery revenues were originally committed to job creation and economic development. Currently 15 percent of net lottery earnings are for parks and natural resources and 18 percent for education. The remaining 67 percent is allocated back to the Legislature for the original intent of the program. This measure amends the Oregon Constitution to finance services for veterans for employment assistance, housing, health care, addiction treatment, reintegration and improving access to government benefits. It would be extended to veterans’ spouses and dependents, too. The 1.5 percent increase is predicted to raise $9.4 million per year. Measure 95: Measure 95 permits public universities to own stock in companies. The state constitution prohibits the state owning stock unless it was donated or involved in a transfer of technology. With the advent of new university governing boards and their ability to manage their own finances and the fact it separates the boards technically from being a state agency; the question of owning stock resurfaced. This measure will amend the Oregon constitution to allow a public university to own stock in companies, associations and corporations. This includes Oregon Institute of Technology and Southern Oregon University. Measure 98: The shortage of a skilled workforce is being felt across the state. Measure 98 requires state funds to be distributed to public schools to establish or expand career and technical education programs; expand college-level education opportunities and expand dropout-prevention programs in high schools. It directs the Legislature to appropriate at least $800 per student for such programs. Funding relies on the growth of the general fund, there are no new funding sources. It commits a minimum increase of $147 million in spending for this program. The Legislature ultimately decides how these programs will be funded from existing funds. Measure 99: Measure 99 would create an Outdoors School Education Fund created from state lottery revenue. It is dedicated to provide every fifth- or sixth-grader in the state the opportunity to attend a week-long outdoors school program or equivalent experience that reflects the local community need. Outdoor school programs have been offered throughout the state since the 1950s. Due to budget cuts, many school districts have either shortened the length of the program or eliminated it. The measure authorizes transfer of not more than $22 million annually from the state lottery fund to this program. OSU Extension Service would be responsible for creating the curriculum and deciding which schools meet the criteria for funding. Measure 100: Largely funded by the Humane Society and billionaire Paul Allen, who backed a similar law in Washington, Measure 100 would prohibit trafficking of certain animal species, such as elephant, rhinoceros, whale, tiger, lion, leopard, sea turtle and shark, among others. Fines could be set up to $6,500 per incident or twice the total value of the animal, whichever is greater. Related Document Oregon Ballot Measures Opponents of 97 By TODD ANDRES President Klamath County Chamber of Commerce As president of the Klamath County Chamber of Commerce, I’ve had the opportunity to talk to businesses large and small about the potential impact of Measure 97 on the local economy. Simply put, Measure 97 is a bad idea that will hurt our local businesses. Everybody wants better schools, but Measure 97 isn’t the right answer. The proposal would put a tax on sales of 2.5 percent for companies with sales of more than $25 million. Some larger companies aren’t registered as “C” corporations, the only kind of business targeted in the measure, so despite their size, they wouldn’t pay. And because it’s a tax on sales, not profits, some businesses with high sales but low profit margins would be hurt far more than others. The only choice many businesses would have is to pass this tax on sales directly on to consumers. That’s why the state’s own economists said that the measure would cost the average Oregon family more than $600 a year and cost the state 38,000 private sector jobs. The majority of this new tax is going to be passed on to consumers. Even the economists hired by the proponents of this measure called Measure 97 a “sales tax on steroids.” It’s by far the biggest tax increase in the history of the state at an estimated $6 billion. The nonpartisan economists at ECONorthwest determined that this tax would be equivalent to a 40 percent corporate income tax — over three times higher than any other state in the country. It is hard to imagine that our businesses could stay competitive in that tax environment. Healthy businesses are the bedrock of a thriving community. Without healthy businesses and good jobs, nobody prospers. Measure 97 is a tax on sales and not profits, and it’s a tax on every transaction. So as some goods pass through multiple companies on the way to their final market, the tax can pyramid, growing at every step in the supply chain. Take, for example, our local grocery stores like Fred Meyer or Albertson's. They often have multiple tiers of distributors providing goods to them who would be taxed at each step. All those taxes would have to be passed on to consumers. The average profit margin at a grocery story is just 2 percent last year according to an industry watcher. There is no way to stay in business except to pass those costs on to consumers. The tax on those grocery stores would be more than their profits, forcing them to pass on those costs or go out of business. The tax pyramiding would mean that the costs of many common goods like food and gas would likely rise 5 percent to 7.5 percent. Lithia Motors headquartered in Medford Oregon has said that the tax could add $1,000 to the cost of a car. A cost that other car companies won’t have to pay because either their sales are lower or they aren’t a C corporation. That hardly seems fair, does it? The supporters of the tax say that it will affect corporations, but the truth is that this will fall hardest on those who can afford it least. Food, clothing, medicine, gasoline, cable or dish TV, insurance, utilities and other essentials will all become more expensive. And despite supporters wish to earmark the funds, the money raised will go into the general fund to be spend however the legislature wishes. Our communities in southern Oregon are still working to recover from the great recession. Our small businesses may not be large enough to pay the tax directly, but they will suffer from the higher costs in almost everything. They will struggle to stay competitive and will have fewer options to deal with the fallout than larger corporations, some of whom can pick up and move out. Jobs that our communities need will be lost. Whether you believe that the state needs more revenue or not, Measure 97 is an ill-conceived tax that will fall hardest on those who can afford it least. It will cost our communities jobs, and make it harder to build and grow the businesses that a community needs to thrive. I hope you will join me in voting no on Measure 97. Oregon and our communities deserve better. Measure 97 will aid schools By KATRINA MYERS English teacher Klamath County School District, and President of the Klamath County Education Association: We see it all around us. Our schools and local services suffer because corporations in Oregon pay lower taxes here than anywhere else in the country. When voters passed Ballot Measure 5 back in 1990, education suffered. The ability of the state to provide enough money to ensure that students receive the best education possible became an impossible task. Our class sizes exploded, teachers were cut, and building upkeep suffered as there was no money to pay for everything. As a veteran teacher of 31 years, and President of Klamath County Education Association, I see it in classrooms all throughout our district — overcrowded classes, too few teachers, and sometimes buildings in need of significant repairs. Oregon has the third largest class sizes, one of the shortest school years in the nation, and the fourth lowest graduation rate. Measure 97 will change that by making big, out-of-state corporations pay their fair share. There are many commercials and Facebook posts that say that this measure will harm our community. Those expensive commercials claim the tax will be passed on to farmers, ranchers and small businesses. Do you really think corporations like Comcast or Bank of America would spend millions and millions to fight this measure if they thought small businesses and families would pick up the tab? No. The truth is they are scared they’ll finally have to pay their fare share. I pay my taxes, so should big out-of-state corporations. Based on data from the Office of Economic Analysis, 82 percent of the revenue raised by Measure 97 would be paid by out-­of-­state corporations. Our students deserve the funding to ensure that they have safe buildings, reasonable class sizes, and quality teachers. I will be voting for Measure 97 because it is the right thing to do for our students, our seniors, and those who need health care. Follow Close Get email notifications on daily!

Microsoft Surface Book 2 is unlikely to be released soon due to rumors that the company is still looking forward for the availability of Intel’s Kaby Lake processor. (Photo: Andrew Burton/Getty Images) Microsoft Surface Book 2's rumored release this October is brewing much anticipation for the fans. Given that the hybrid laptop's original version was launched in the same month last year, there are speculations that the tech company is likely to follow a release pattern for the upgraded version launch. However, some reports indicate that the upcoming device will be immediately available. The new Microsoft Surface Book 2 is unlikely to be released soon due to rumors that the company is still looking forward for the availability of Intel's Kaby Lake processor. According to reports, the said processor can provide a faster processing without compromising the laptop's battery life. Aside from that, there are speculations that Microsoft also awaits the Redstone 2 update for Windows 10 OS that is expected to release in the Spring of 2017. Microsoft Surface Book 2 is believed to come with a 4K resolution and 3D display, including a USB 3.1 support for faster data transfer.  Rumors also claim that the device will sport OneClip and Office Hub features. In addition, the hybrid laptop is also expected to be released along with the Surface Pro 5. As rumors continue to emerge, consumers still believe that the new device will be released soon, MNR Daily reported. Meanwhile, as the latest information about the new Microsoft Lumia devices and Surface Pro 4 had reportedly leaked, details about the release of Surface Book seem to be unclear. According to reports, there has never been any product that has captured the attention of a number of people like the Microsoft Surface Book. Although vendor comments are usually mocked that they just reinvent a product category, it is also difficult to contradict the tech company when it claims to reinvent the laptop. Microsoft Surface Book is reported to have a desktop-class performance brought by its Skylake internals, including a Nvidia GPU, a complete version of Windows 10 Pro display that can be removed and a 12-hour battery life, The Inquirer reported.

Keith Noonan (keithnoonan) Oct 15, 2016 at 8:02PM Image source: Getty Images. A technology ETF, short for exchange-traded fund, is essentially an index fund that links a group of tech equities together as a single security trading on the market. These securities trade like stocks and give investors an opportunity to ride momentum in the broader technology industry or a specific segment of it while diversifying their holdings to minimize risk. ETFs often carry lower fees than investing directly in stocks to mirror an index, and do not have the minimum investment thresholds required by many mutual funds, making them relatively easy and versatile ways to take broad positions in technology.  With the tech sector generally more prone to big volatility than other segments of the market, investing in technology ETFs can be a good way to stake a long-term position that requires little in the way of investor management and perhaps provides some downside protection by being spread across multiple stocks. Investors looking to minimize risk and expenses should look to market-weighted ETFs, funds which determine weightings based on the market value of securities and are assembled to track an index rather than aiming to outperform it. With that in mind, here are three top market-weighted technology ETFs to buy in 2016. Vanguard Information Technology ETF The Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEMKT:VGT) offers investors exposure to a wide range of the tech sector at a low cost and with very high liquidity, and aims to track the MSCI US Investable Market Information Technology 25/50 Index. The fund says its expense ratio is 93% lower than the average expense ratio of funds with similar holdings. It sits at just 0.1%, representing an annual cost of $1 for every $1,000 invested. VGT tracks 374 stocks, manages roughly $9.9 billion in assets, and has a daily average trading volume of over 391,000 shares over the last three months, providing ease of securing or exiting a position. Its main holdings are spread out over software and IT services (47.3%), device hardware (16.4%), semiconductors (13%), professional and communications services (11%), and networking (7%), and the top five equities in the fund are Apple at roughly 12.5% of net holdings, Alphabet at 10%, Microsoft at 9.2%, Facebook at 6.2%, and Intel at 3.6%. The VGT does not include telecom stocks, but does include stakes in credit card companies with Visa (roughly 3.3% of net holdings) and MasterCard (roughly 2% of net holdings) representing the seventh and 10th biggest stakes, respectively. The fund's 10 largest holdings account for roughly 56% of net assets. While the VGT is largely comprised of big S&P 500 tech holdings, it also holds substantial stakes in small- and mid-cap stocks. VGT is up roughly 12% year-to-date, and has a dividend yield of roughly 1.3%.  Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF Like the Vanguard Information Technology ETF, the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLK) offers broad exposure to the tech sector with high liquidity and relatively low expense fees. XLK aims to track the Technology Select Sector Index, and is the largest of the tech ETFs by measure of total assets, with roughly $13.1 billion in assets under management held across 72 securities. The fund is also the most traded tech ETF, with an average of more than 1 million shares traded daily over the last three months. While XLK is traded substantially more than VGT, both funds are highly liquid to the point that composition of holdings and expenses are the more important differentiating factors.   Its annual expense ratio sits at 0.14% -- 40% higher than VGT's but still low relative to most other comparable tech ETFs. XLK is more top-heavy than VGT, with its top 10 holdings making up 63.6% of the fund. Unlike VGT, XLK holds no small-cap companies and is light on mid-caps, making it less exposed to the volatility associated with non-large-cap companies. The top five equities in the fund are Apple at 13.8% of holdings, Alphabet at 10.4%, Microsoft at 10.1%, Facebook at 6.7%, and AT&T at 5.4%.  In terms of composition of assets, one of the main differences between XLK and VGT is that XLK has significant telecom holdings. The fund's seventh-largest holding is Verizon -- at roughly 3.8% of the total fund. Investors looking for exposure to telecom companies might choose to go with XLK over VGT for that reason. Looking at VGT's top holdings by sector, software and IT services represent 41.8% of net holdings, computing hardware 16.6%, semiconductors 11.3%, telecommunications 10.4%, and professional and communications services 10.2%. The fund is up roughly 13% year-to-date, and has a dividend yield of approximately 1.7%. First Trust Dow Jones Internet ETF Investors willing to tolerate greater risk in pursuit of greater returns and of the mind that internet companies stand a strong chance of leading the tech sector in coming years should consider the First Trust Dow Jones Internet ETF (NYSEMKT:FDN), which is built to track the Dow Jones Internet Composite Index. Unlike VGT, XLK, and other broad-coverage ETFs, FDN is not diversified outside of internet-related businesses -- a characteristic that exposes it to greater volatility, but also opens the door for large gains if internet sector momentum continues. First Trust lists stocks under the information technology segment as making up 70.3% of holdings, with consumer discretionary the next largest segment at 21.4%, followed by financials at 4.7%, healthcare at 2.7%, and telecommunication services at 1%.  FDN is the largest of the dedicated internet ETFs by measure of total assets, covering 42 securities, and with net holdings of roughly $3.7 billion. The fund's expense ratio of 0.54% is in line with comparable internet-focused funds, but FDN offers the advantage of strong liquidity -- with average daily trading volume of roughly 510,000 shares over the last three months. The company's top five largest holdings are Amazon.com at 10.6%, Alphabet at 9.8%, Facebook at 9.7%, Netflix at 4.8%, and PayPal at 4.7%.  For the internet-focused ETF investor, FDN's reasonable costs and tradability make it a top choice. The fund is up 9.4% year-to-date; it does not pay a dividend.  Keith Noonan has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends AAPL, FB, MA, NFLX, PYPL, and V.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple See Which Android Antivirus Apps Perform Best (and Worst) Marshall Honorof Senior Writer Tech Media Network (Tom's Guide)October 17, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Most security stories are inherently bad news — either there's some new way to compromise your system, or some old way that's already compromising it. It's refreshing, then, to learn that in the world of Android security, you're probably in good hands, no matter which antivirus program you have installed. A new study from AV-TEST confirms that almost 30 leading Android security programs do a perfectly good job of keeping phones and tablets safe. Credit: Georgejmclittle/ShutterstockMore Credit: Georgejmclittle/Shutterstock AV-TEST, a Madgeburg, Germany-based independent testing lab, constantly runs tests on various AV programs to see which ones keep Windows, Mac OS X and Android devices safe. In its September 2016 results for Android programs, a whopping nine programs took home perfect scores, but every single one of the 27 apps tested did at least a passable job screening and preventing infections. MORE: Best Antivirus Software and Apps Each program underwent three forms of evaluation: Protection (six points), Usability (six points) and Further Important Security Features (one point). AV-TEST measured Protection on two counts: how well the program blocked known Android malware, and how well it blocked newly discovered Android malware. Usability measured a program’s intuitiveness and user-friendliness. Features looked for anti-theft measures, call-blocking, message filtering, safe browsing, parental controls, backup and encryption. AV-TEST didn't put too much stock in extra features, though; even if a program had every single one, the most it could earn was one point. While it would take too long to detail every single program's ranking, the nine that merited perfect scores were AhnLab V3 Mobile Security, Baidu Mobile Security, Bitdefender Mobile Security, Intel McAfee Mobile Security, Kaspersky Internet Security for Android, Qihoo 360 Antivirus, Sophos Mobile Security, Symantec Norton Mobile Security and Tencent WeSecure. Of those, Bitdefender, Sophos and Tencent scored perfect 100 percent ratings in Protection; the rest hovered between 99.7 and 99.9 percent. On the other end of the spectrum were Alibaba Mobile Security (8.5), NHSC Droid-X 3 (9.5), Webroot SecureAnywhere Mobile (10) and Quick Heal Total Security (10.5) These programs tended to fall down when it came to Protection more than Usability, discovering somewhere between 92 and 97 percent of potential malware. The rest of the programs fell somewhere in the middle, and include well-known manufacturers such as AVG, Avira and Trend Micro. If you have one of the bottom-rated programs, you may not want to toss your phone into a bonfire to exorcise the malware demons just yet, though. AV-TEST granted a recommendation to any program that earned a score of 8 or above, and every single program tested met that minimum requirement. No program — even a "perfect" one — can protect you from every single potential threat, but a minimum score of 8 suggests that an app is probably ready to defend you against most of what the Internet can throw your way. Especially since some of these programs are free, there’s no reason why Android users should let their mobile devices go unprotected. Unless, of course, you relish the idea of performing a factory reset and downloading all of your music and movies again.

Which headset should you buy? We're here to help Correction appended Friday, Oct. 14. On some level or another, virtual reality technology has been around for decades. But this year is the first time you can go out and buy a headset that brings VR into your home. There’s a wide range of virtual reality headsets on the market, from the high-end Oculus Rift to the entry-level Samsung Gear VR (not to mention the DIY cardboard variety). All of them offer a wide variety of experiences, ranging from games to interactive stories to 360-degree video. So which VR headset is right for you? That decision will likely come down to how much you’re willing to spend, and what kind of hardware you already own. Most of these headsets cost hundreds of dollars, while some require expensive, high-end computers to help power them. Here’s a closer look at how today’s VR offerings compare — and which headsets we recommend. BEST PICK: Samsung Gear VR Tyler Essary for TIMESamsung Gear VR Price: $99.99 System Requirements: Compatible with the following Samsung phones: Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S6 Edge+, Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge Estimated cost of system requirements: Between approx. $629 and $800, depending on which Samsung phone you choose (without carrier subsidy) Number of available apps and games: 400 apps through the Oculus Store, 1,000-plus videos through Samsung’s VR content service Sensors: Gyroscope, accelerometer, proximity sensor, touchpad for navigation Field of view: 101 degrees Resolution: Based on Samsung phones with 2,560×1,440 resolution display (Note: Resolution when looking through the Gear VR will be lower since it provides a windowed view of the phone’s screen) Refresh Rate: 60Hz What’s in the box: Samsung Gear VR headset The Samsung Gear VR‘s $99.99 price, the fact that it’s cordless, and its overall effortless setup make it a more practical, albeit more limited, option than premium virtual reality headsets like the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. Unless you’re an early adopter, the Gear VR is probably the best option for you, especially if you already own a Samsung phone. Why is the Gear VR so inexpensive? It has several limitations: It doesn’t track your body’s movement in the digital space the way the Vive, Rift, and PlayStation VR do, vastly restricting how you can interact with virtual objects. This means you can’t wave, duck, or aim at characters using the Gear VR the same way you can with these other headsets. Instead, you’ll need to use the touchpad mounted on the side of the headset or a controller accessory to navigate virtual worlds. That said, the Gear VR offers a convincing enough experience to trick your brain into thinking your body is moving, a sensation that makes virtual reality unlike anything else you’ve tried before. The experience is vivid enough to give you a taste of virtual reality, but at a much more accessible price point than the other headsets listed here. Samsung’s Gear VR has plenty of room for improvement. Its biggest drawback is that it lacks a controller specifically designed for virtual reality. Google’s upcoming Daydream View headset, which costs only $79 and could eventually be compatible with a wider range of smartphones, launches in November — with a remote that enables gesture controls. If it works well, Google’s headset could replace the Gear VR as our top pick in this list. But it’s worth mentioning that Gear VR is powered by the Oculus platform, meaning it already has lots of great content and is likely to get more features down the road. Buy here RUNNER UP: PlayStation VR Tyler Essary for TIMESony PlayStation VR Price: $399.99 System Requirements: PlayStation 4 (standard, Pro, or Slim), PlayStation Camera, PlayStation Move controllers (optional but recommended) Estimated cost of system requirements: Around $300-$400 depending on the console model, about $59.99 for PlayStation Camera, $49.99 per PlayStation Move controller Number of available apps and games: 30 at launch, 50 before the end of the year Sensors: Six-axis motion sensing system (three-axis gyroscope, three-axis accelerometer) Field of view: About 100 degrees Resolution: 1920×1080 with full color RGB Refresh Rate: 120Hz, 90Hz What’s in the box: VR headset, processor unit, VR headset connection cable, HDMI cable, USB cable, stereo headphones, AC power cord, AC adaptor, demo disc with 15 games At about $400, the PlayStation VR is significantly cheaper than other premium VR offerings, like the $600 Oculus Rift and $800 HTC Vive. It’s an especially sensible option for VR-curious gamers who already own a PlayStation 4, since Sony’s current console and a $59.99 camera are all you need to power the device (Sony’s roughly $25 Move controllers are optional). Regardless, those who don’t own a PlayStation 4 can buy one for hundreds of dollars cheaper than the near-$1,000 PC currently needed to power the Vive and the Rift. Hardcore gamers that own both a PlayStation 4 and a beastly PC may be wondering how the PlayStation VR compares to its more expensive rivals. While the PlayStation VR’s resolution may not be as sharp as that of the Vive and Rift, Sony’s headset is more comfortable to wear, easier to set up than HTC’s, and offers motion control support at launch. (Rift owners won’t be able to play games using gestures until the company ships its $199 Touch controllers on Dec. 6.) Although the Rift’s resolution is technically higher, the PlayStation VR‘s display has been specifically designed to show red, green, and blue colors at a higher quality than black. This makes graphics appear vivid and clear, since it’s more difficult to see the black spaces between the pixels on the PlayStation VR‘s screen. The mechanism Sony put in place for adjusting the headset’s fit and focus is also much simpler than that of most VR headsets, and is especially friendly to glasses-wearers. The PlayStation VR‘s major drawback is that users are bound by unwieldy cables, which sometimes hinder the experience. That’s also an issue with the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, both of which need to be tethered to a computer to work. This is in part why smartphone-powered, and therefore cordless, headsets like the Samsung Gear VR are so attractive. The downside of those headsets, however, is that they don’t provide as high-end an experience. My other gripe with the PlayStation VR is that it doesn’t do a great job at making it easy to see the Move controllers when you’re not playing a specific game. The Vive, by contrast, displays your controllers in the digital space, making it easier to navigate menus and change settings. The PlayStation VR doesn’t do this, meaning it’s tough to switch between the standard DualShock controller and the Move sticks while wearing the headset. Buy here Oculus Rift Price: $599 System Requirements: Computer with the following specifications: NVIDIA GTX 970/AMD R9 290 equivalent or greater, Intel i5-4590 or greater, 8GB or more of RAM, Compatible HDMI 1.3 video output, 3 USB 3.0 ports and 1 USB 2.0 port, Windows 7 Sp1 64 bit or newer Estimated cost of system requirements: Around $1,000 (Microsoft and Best Buy offer bundles that include both the headset and a compatible computer) Number of available apps and games: More than 100 games Sensors: Gyroscope, accelerometer, optical sensor for peripheral space tracking Field of view: 110 degrees Resolution: 1,200×1,080 pixels per eye Refresh Rate: 90Hz What’s in the box: Oculus Rift headset with quick start guide, camera sensor with built-in stand, small plastic tool for integrated headphone removal, Oculus Remote with integrated battery, Xbox One wireless gamepad, Xbox One USB wireless receiver for gamepad and instructions, two AA batteries for gamepad, two Oculus logo stickers, Oculus lens wipe cloth The Oculus Rift’s high resolution display and beefy system requirements means it offers smooth and realistic virtual reality gameplay. In my experience, using the Rift felt very similar to playing games on the PlayStation VR, although the Rift’s display resolution is a bit crisper. When the Facebook-owned Oculus starts selling its motion remotes in December, I presume this too will feel more or less the same as using the PlayStation VR’s Move wands. Like the PlayStation VR, the Rift requires a single camera which tracks the wearer’s motion. That enables players to wave and point these motion-sensitive remotes within the camera’s range to interact with games and apps. Such functionality is crucial for making VR feel more real than it does when using a regular game controller. Rift owners who wish to upgrade the experience can opt to purchase additional sensors for $79 each, which can enable a room-scale virtual reality experience similar to that of the HTC Vive. The Rift, while it suffers from the same annoying dangling wire issue as its rivals, certainly won’t disappoint. But for gamers seeking a premium VR experience, we recommend the PlayStation VR instead, simply because it’s cheaper. The differences between the two headsets in terms of performance and game selection isn’t different enough to justify an extra $200, not to mention the expensive PC you’ll need to run the Rift. Still, this could very well change in the future. Facebook wants to make VR the next great social platform, so the Oculus is likely to see new features that will make it useful for more than just gaming and watching movies. (These features could also come to cheaper headsets on the Oculus platform, like the aforementioned Samsung Gear VR.) There is one reason to pick the Rift over the PlayStation VR: If you’ve already got a high-end gaming computer, and you don’t have a PlayStation 4, it makes more financial sense for you to pick up the Rift. Buy here HTC Vive Tyler Essary for TIMEHTC Vive Price: $799 System Requirements: Computer with the following specifications: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 or Radeon RX 480 equivalent or better, Intel Core i5-4590 or AMD FX 8350 equivalent or better, 4 GB RAM or more, HDMI 1.4, DisplayPort 1.2 or newer, 1 USB 2.0 or better, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1 or later Estimated cost of system requirements: Around $1,000 Number of available apps and games: 717 games and experiences between Steam and HTC’s Viveport store Sensors: Inertial measurement units (IMU), positional tracking, G-sensor (accelerometer), gyroscope, proximity Field of view: 110 degrees Resolution: 1080×1200 pixels per eye Refresh Rate: 90Hz What’s in the box: 2 base stations, 2 controllers with lanyards, headset (with 3 in 1 cable and audio cable), sync cable, base station power adaptor, mounting kit, link box, link box mounting pad, link box power adaptor, HDMI cable, USB cable, earbuds, alternate face cushion, cleaning cloth, two micro-USB chargers (for the controllers) As it stands, the HTC Vive is in a class of its own. Comparing it to the Oculus Rift, PlayStation VR, and Samsung Gear VR almost feels unfair. That’s because the Vive uses two special sensors that physically map your environment, making it possible to wonder around virtual worlds like you’re on Star Trek’s holodeck. It’s a limited effect, but you can walk over to an object and interact with it, for instance, rather than just waving or aiming at targets in front of you. It’s strikingly different from other VR headsets, making it the most impressive such gadget on the market by a long shot. The Rift will support similar experiences when it starts shipping extra sensors for its headset later this year. That said, the Vive is also the most expensive VR system. The $800 price tag, especially when combined with the approximately $1,000 PC you’ll need to power it, is steep. The cumbersome setup process, meanwhile, is a pain. This type of virtual reality, which lets you freely explore the space around you, is still better suited for use in theme parks and other kind of arcade simulations. From that perspective, making room scale support an optional feature for the Oculus Rift seems like a smart move. Rather than paying around $800 for a package that includes two sensors, the headset, and Touch controllers, Rift buyers can go à la carte and choose whether they want just the controllers or the whole bundle. All told, we’re looking forward to the next generation of headsets, which might make the Vive’s power available at a cheaper price.

Finance Search Wed, Nov 16, 2016, 6:25 PM AEDT - Australia Markets closed Global stocks stumble ahead of earnings, ECBBy John Biers | AFP – Mon, Oct 17, 2016 10:37 PM AEDT Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Related Content View Photo The British pound's big jump weighed on London's benchmark FTSE 100 index Global stocks mostly retreated Monday as investors girded for a trove of earnings reports from US and European companies and a European Central Bank monetary policy meeting. Caution was the rule with bourses falling in New York, Europe and most of Asia. Besides uncertainty about earnings and the ECB, analysts pointed to the drag from lower oil prices and edginess ahead of the US presidential election. "The burden of proof lies with the bulls to demonstrate that the market can in fact move higher with all the various economic and political headwinds that we are currently facing," said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities. ECB chief Mario Draghi will be under pressure this week to clarify the bank's stimulus plans after investors were spooked by talk of an end to its massive bond-buying program. Europe's main equities markets ended the day on the back foot, with Paris down 0.5 percent and Frankfurt 0.7 percent. London's FTSE 100 index fell 0.9 percent and the pound remained under pressure amid reports of divisions between British finance minister Philip Hammond and other cabinet members over how the country should proceed with its exit from the EU, with some suggesting he may resign. US stocks also pulled back, with the S&P 500 sliding 0.3 percent despite another better-than-expected earnings result from a big bank, in this case, Bank of America. Bank of America gained 0.3 percent after it reported that third-quarter net profit rose 6.6 percent to $4.5 billion, easily topping analyst expectations. Last week, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo all bested expectations. - Low expectations - Still, investor sentiment is skittish due to an "earnings recession" with the S&P 500 expected to notch its fifth straight quarter of declining operating profits, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S&P Global. Intel, McDonald's, General Electric and Microsoft will report later this week. The low expectations open the possibility for a positive surprise. Netflix fell 1.7 percent prior to its earnings release late Monday, but surged nearly 20 percent after-hours after the company reported strong subscriber growth. "We will certainly have a better gauge of market sentiment a few days from now than we do right now," said James. In Tokyo, the Nikkei climbed 0.3 percent, with major exporters were lifted by a rally in the dollar against the yen. However, the dollar pulled back later in the day against the yen and euro. Omer Esiner, analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange, said foreign exchange traders viewed comments Friday from Fed Chair Janet Yellen highlighting the importance of running a "high-pressure economy" as suggesting interest rates in the US may "rise at a slower pace compared to previous Fed tightening cycles." - Key figures around 2100 GMT - New York - DOW: DOWN 0.3 percent at 18,086.40 (close) New York - S&P 500: DOWN 0.3 percent at 2,126.50 (close) New York - Nasdaq: DOWN 0.3 percent at 5,199.82 (close) London - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.9 percent at 6,947.55 points (close) Frankfurt - DAX 30: DOWN 0.7 percent at 10,503.57 (close) Paris - CAC 40: DOWN 0.5 percent at 4,450.23 (close) EURO STOXX 50: DOWN 0.7 percent at 3,008.72 (close) Tokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 0.3 percent at 16,900.12 (close) Hong Kong - Hang Seng: DOWN 0.8 percent at 23,037.54 (close) Shanghai - Composite: DOWN 0.7 percent at 3,041.17 (close) Euro/dollar: UP at $1.1001 from $1.0974 Friday Dollar/yen: DOWN at 103.88 yen from 104.16 yen Pound/dollar: DOWN at $1.2182 from $1.2193 Euro/pound: UP at 90.31 pence from 90.01 pence Oil - West Texas Intermediate: DOWN 41 cents at $49.94 a barrel Oil - Brent North Sea: DOWN 43 cents at $51.52 a barrel @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories » Qld govt gives $500k to mining explorationAAP The Queensland government has committed $500,000 for resource exploration projects in northwest Queensland.

Project Catapult, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) project established in 2011 by Microsoft, is starting to pay off for users of the company's services, according the Redmond, Wash., software giant. Microsoft today shared a behind-the-scenes look at how FPGA technology is transforming its Bing search engine and helping to accelerate Azure workloads. FPGAs, as the term suggests, are chips that can be reconfigured, or "reprogrammed," through software after manufacture, enabling customers to accelerate select workloads without incurring the processing overhead of additional software. Cloud providers, particularly those on the hyperscale end of the spectrum, have a keen interest in FPGAs. Beset by unpredictable and rapidly changing workloads, cloud companies can employ FPGAs to help them adapt faster and more readily to the demands of the market. In Microsoft's case, the company is using FPGAs in an effort to build an artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputer in the cloud. Users will soon be able to judge those efforts for themselves by seeking answers on Bing, Microsoft's search engine. Currently, Bing is using Catapult technology to generate faster, more accurate results. "By the end of 2016, an artificial intelligence technique called deep neural networks will be deployed on Catapult to help Bing improve its search results," blogged Microsoft Research writer Allison Linn on Oct. 17. "This AI supercomputer in the cloud will increase the speed and efficiency of Microsoft's data centers—and anyone who uses Bing should notice the difference, too." On the Azure cloud computing platform, FPGAs are being tapped to help Microsoft increase the speed and efficiency of its cloud servers with less hardware. Additionally, FPGAs are being used to speed up the networks of the company's data centers. "To make data flow faster, [the Catapult team] inserted an FPGA between the network and the servers," Linn added. "That can be used to manage traffic going back and forth between the network and server, to communicate directly to other FPGAs or servers or to speed up computation on the local server." Intel, better known for minting its fortunes with general-purpose processors, is also embracing FPGAs. In April, the company announced it had begun shipping Xeon server chips with FPGA accelerator technology. The multichip platform is pairing 14-nanometer Xeon E5-2600 v4 processors (Broadwell) with the Arria10 FPGAs from Altera. Intel acquired Altera, a San Jose, Calif.-based provider of FPGA technology, late last year. The deal, worth an estimated $16.7 billion, was Intel's largest-ever acquisition and set the stage for a new business unit within Intel called the Programmable Solutions Group (PSG). "Altera is now part of Intel, and together we will make the next generation of semiconductors not only better but able to do more,” said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich in a Dec. 28 announcement. "We will apply Moore's Law to grow today's FPGA business, and we'll invent new products that make amazing experiences of the future possible—experiences like autonomous driving and machine learning."                       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Salakhutdinov says he is excited to join Apple as a director of AI research, even as he continues his work at CMU. He also extended an invitation to other researchers to join his team. The Register understands that since the summer Salakhutdinov has been working with Apple on a part-time basis – one day a week, essentially – as part of an effort to improve the company's relationship with academia. Last year, Bloomberg reported that Apple's culture of secrecy made it harder for the company to recruit technical talent from academic institutions, where the publication of research and the sharing of information is critical for professional recognition and advancement. At the time, Apple researchers had not published a single academic research paper on AI. Meanwhile, the iThing maker had 42 open positions that mentioned artificial intelligence on its job website and 120 that mentioned machine learning. Presently, Apple has 56 open positions that list artificial intelligence and 129 that include machine learning. Technology companies like Apple, Google, IBM, Intel, and Salesforce have been buying up AI startups at a rapid pace in an effort to integrate AI-related technology – machine learning, computer vision, and the like – into products and services. Apple this year acquired machine learning companies Turi and Tuplejump. Its 2010 acquisition of Siri remains its highest-profile investment in AI. And its recently curtailed self-driving car initiative, Project Titan, also depends upon AI. According to research firm CB Insights, there have been 140 acquisitions of AI-oriented startups since 2011. Apple, however, has not been active in releasing AI-related software. While Baidu, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft have released projects like Warp-CTC, FBLearner Flow, TensorFlow, and CNTK – releases that mix altruism with cloud business lead generation – Apple has kept its AI technology to itself. Late last month, Amazon, Google, Facebook, IBM, and Microsoft announced the formation of the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society, a group that aims to benefit businesses investing in AI by influencing the development and regulation of cognitive technology. Apple remains conspicuously absent from this group. Apple's decision to open source the Swift programming language last year suggests the company isn't entirely hermetic. Asked about this, Apple did not respond to a request for comment. ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 3 Comments More from The Register Dell/Quest Software plans layoffs and relocations – source Some products may go, too, once private equiteers take over 3 Comments Springpath to focus on Cisco OEM development Go-to-market machine is in gear 2 Comments Liberal Party of Australia: why are you paying so much for ancient software?

Follow TechnoBuffalo Acer introduced a new version of its Chromebook 15 on Monday. It’s the latest model of Acer’s affordable $199 Chromebook, and the company says you’ll be able to use the Chromebook 15 through the work day and then some. The Acer Chromebook 15 CBS-532-C47C (not a sexy name, we know), will reportedly last up to 12 hours on a single charge. That beats out a lot of computers. Keep in mind that you’re using a Chromebook, however, which is fairly limited in what it can do. The new Chromebook 15 has a 1366 x 768-pixel display, two USB 3.0 ports, an HDMI port, 16GB of storage, 2GB of RAM and an Intel Celeron N3060 processor. Not exactly a Core i7 gaming machine, but that’s the point. An affordable Chromebook worth considering The Acer Chromebook 15 is worth considering for a few reasons. The battery life alone is desirable, but the price is also perfect for folks who aren’t sure if they want to dive right into Chrome OS yet. It’s also compelling if you’ve been wanting to try Android apps on Chrome OS. While the support isn’t quite there for the Chromebook 15 just yet, it’s relatively easy to hack it onto most Chromebooks. The Chromebook 15 is available from Walmart now.

(Seeking Alpha) Citing improved near-term sales trend and lower balance sheet risk, Oppenheimer upgraded Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) to Perform from Underperform. The firm also left its estimates unchanged. Analyst Rick Schafer views several positive developments, such as a smaller than expected decline in PC shipments, early signs of Polaris winning share back at the low-end of the graphics market and early positive feedback on its Zen processors, which are currently being sampled and are set to launch early next year, as providing the company a better set-up. Opportunity in China Oppenheimer sees low-hanging fruit for the company in Chin. The firm also believes the company's $1.3 billion financing alleviates going-concern risk. Going by Intel Corporation's (NASDAQ: INTC) positive pre-announcement and data points from NB ODMs, the firm sees third quarter outperformance. That said, the firm believes AMD is still fighting an uphill battle due to the competitive threat posed by Intel in the computer processor market and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) in the graphic user interface market. Long-Term Challenging The firm believes improvement in growth/profitability remains a challenge. Although the firm expects Polaris and Zen to provide some neat-term relief, the firm is of the view that it's too early to determine the magnitude of share shifts.

The only thing protecting them now is that they have funding that takes them to the end of this year or the middle of next year, but by March or April it’s going to get very bloody.” He predicted this year that major technology companies would cut 330,000 jobs as the industry shifted to mobile and cloud-based computing. That number was later revised upward to 369,000 as Intel Corp. started shedding jobs. “The layoffs I predicted have been occurring,” he said. “They will always remain unemployed. Their skills will be obsolete.” He says funding for startups is drying up, leaving companies with dim prospects for survival. “The bubble will burst,” he said. “The impacts on the tech industry will last two years.” Technology companies in the U.S. have shed about 63,000 jobs, outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. told Reuters in August.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Samsung’s new 10nm process promises big power efficiency improvements Samsung claims up to 27-percent higher performance or 40-percent lower power. by Andrew Cunningham - Oct 17, 2016 5:06 pm UTC Login to bookmark 113 Samsung The news hasn't been great for Samsung's smartphone division lately, but there is good news for the chipmaking arm of the company: Samsung announced today that it has started to mass-produce chips on its new 10nm LPE manufacturing process, a major improvement over its current 14nm process. According to Samsung, 10nm chips can fit 30 percent more transistors within the same physical area as a 14nm chip. Chip designers will be able to create chips that are up to 27 percent faster or chips that use up to 40 percent less power, though most chips will probably do a little of both instead of maximizing one or the other. A second-generation, 10nm LPP process will begin mass production in the second half of 2017, roughly one year from today. Other than the timing, we only know that this revision is intended to boost performance. Samsung's own Exynos chips are often the first to benefit from the company's manufacturing process improvements, but plenty of other chipmakers use Samsung's factories to make their chips. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820 and 821 are both made on Samsung's 14nm process, and in the past Apple has used Samsung to make multiple generations of its A-series chips (more recently, some of that business has gone to TSMC). It's difficult to directly compare manufacturing processes between companies, but Intel has been struggling with its own 10nm process just as it struggled with its 14nm process a couple of years ago. The delays have effectively broken its "tick-tock" model, though this year's "Kaby Lake" chips use a tweaked version of the 14nm process that Intel calls 14nm+. Samsung's 10nm chips will begin to hit devices early next year, possibly beginning with the spring's Android flagships.

By DC Velocity Staff Comment Emerging markets are broadly forecast to drive demand for retail services in coming decades, but a report released today says poorly planned road networks could throw a wrench into efforts by developing regions to keep up with rising demands for freight movement. Despite rising consumer demand, many developing countries are saddled with poor infrastructure that triggers road traffic jams, increased fuel waste, and monetary losses, according to the report from London-based analyst firm Research and Markets. The problem is caused by planners' inability to keep up with a fast-changing regional landscape, leading to traffic congestion hot spots, poor traffic management, and extended traffic jams, the report says. Possible solutions include privatized highways, new fees for road pricing, and the development of railway intelligent transportation systems (ITS), analysts report. Regions that adopt intelligent rail networks can build a transportation-system backbone that provides a competitive edge over other freight modes while preserving consumer safety, the report concludes. The global ITS market is forecast to growth from $32.5 billion in 2015 to $57.2 billion in 2022, providing growth opportunities for IT firms such as Cisco Systems Inc., Computer Science Corp., IBM Corp., Intel Corp., Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp., Siemens AG, and ZTE Corp., Research and Markets said. #Logistics #Transportation #Trucking #Railroads Resources Mentioned In This Article Cisco Systems Inc.

Samsung Electronics has begun mass production of 10-nanometer chips that will be used in devices starting next year, with reports saying that the upcoming Galaxy 8 smartphone could be one of those devices. Samsung officials announced the mass production of the tiny 10nm FinFET system-on-a-chip (SoC) Oct. 17, adding that the company is the first chip maker to reach that goal. Other vendors, including Intel and Qualcomm, are pushing in that direction. In addition, Intel's foundry business also will manufacture 10nm mobile chips for devices that will be based on ARM's low-power processor designs. The new FinFET chip delivers an enhanced 3D transistor structure that includes improvements in both process technology and design over the current 14nm products. The result is an SoC that provides 27 percent better performance and 40 percent lower power consumption in a space 30 percent smaller, according to Samsung officials. In addition, such capabilities as triple patterning to enable bidirectional routing will let engineers keep design and routing flexibility over previous chips and overcome scaling limitations, they said. Qualcomm is the world's largest provider of processors for mobile devices, but Samsung also is a player. Its ARM-based Exynos chips run many of the company's Galaxy smartphones and other mobile devices, and reports earlier this month indicated that Samsung will be the only contract manufacturer of Qualcomm's upcoming Snapdragon 830 SoC, using its 10nm manufacturing processes. Those chips will be used in half of the next Galaxy smartphones, which will roll out early next year and reportedly will feature a curved display and dual cameras on the back. After Samsung introduces its first-generation 10nm process (10LPE), the second-generation process (10LPP)—which will deliver even better performance—will go into mass production in the second half of next year. There also will be derivative processes aimed at a broad array of applications and an ecosystem of partners and customers around the 10nm process that company officials hope to fuel with such offerings as reference flow verification, IPs and libraries. Samsung also is offering process design kits (PDKs) and IP design kits, which will help customers get going on designs using the 10nm process. Samsung officials expect digital devices using the new 10nm SoCs to be hitting the market early next year, with wide availability coming throughout 2017. The announcement of the 10nm SoCs will be welcome news to Samsung and its customers. The company recently has been hit by problems with its latest flagship device, the Galaxy Note7. Samsung has halted production of the smartphone since reports surfaced that not only was the original devices prone to catching fire, but so were the replacement phones the company had sent out. The Note7 debacle will cost Samsung. Company officials said last week that not only was the device maker taking a $2.6 billion charge against its latest quarterly financial earnings due to the problems, but that they also expected the problems would have an additional $3.1 billion "negative impact" on operating profits through the current quarter and the first three months of 2017.           LATEST MOBILE ARTICLES   Apple And PayPal Enable Payments Through Siri Voice Commands Revamped Google Play Music to Use Machine Learning to Suggest Songs Google Rebuts EU Complaint About Android Bundling Charges GoPro Recalls All 2,500 of the New Karma Drones Sold to Customers Google Gives Gmail for iOS Major Overhaul                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Paul Allen commented that “Pico is currently the global market leader in PC-based oscilloscopes, and we would like to become market leader here in southern Africa, too.” • The University of Cape Town has dropped in the Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) rankings of the world’s best universities, but remains the highest ranked African institution. Despite a worrying trend that has seen it drop 50 ranking spots in the last two years, UCT management maintains this is not an indication that the quality of research or teaching have declined. Rather, it attributes it to changes in the QS rankings methodology for citations. Overseas Business • u-blox announced its financial results for the first half of this year. Consolidated revenues for the first half of 2016 stood at CHF 179,7 million, representing an increase of 11,0% over the comparable period in 2015, when the company enjoyed exceptionally strong growth. Both segments in which the company operates – positioning and wireless products, and wireless services – continued their double-digit growth path in the first half of 2016. Companies • ON Semiconductor has successfully completed its previously announced $2,4 billion cash acquisition of Fairchild Semiconductor, furthering its ambition of becoming the premier supplier of power management and analog semiconductor solutions for a wide range of applications and end-markets. In order to secure the necessary regulatory approvals for the acquisition, ON Semiconductor was compelled to sell its Ignition IGBT business, which Littelfuse picked up, together with ON’s transient voltage suppression (TVS) diode and switching thyristor product lines, for a combined $104 million in cash. • Texas Instruments recently entered into an agreement with Silicon Catalyst, a Silicon Valley-based incubator, that will expand TI’s access to new technology innovations and potentially lead to engagements with semiconductor startups focused on creating chips and system solutions in analog and embedded processing. In the past 15 months, Silicon Catalyst has screened nearly 100 startups from the US, Europe and Asia. The 10 startups admitted to the incubator are developing innovations in LED, energy, silicon photonics, memory technology, wireless communications and biomedical devices. Industry • The Semiconductor Industry Association announced worldwide sales of semiconductors reached $27,1 billion for the month of July 2016, an increase of 2,6% compared to the previous month’s total. July marked the global market’s largest month-to-month sales increase since September 2013, though sales were down 2,8% compared to the July 2015 total. Underscoring the welcome uptick, month-to-month sales increased in all regional markets for the first time since October 2015. • According to the latest analysis by Semicast Research, revenues for industrial semiconductors are forecast to grow to $61,5 billion in 2021, from $40,7 billion in 2015, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7%. Compared with a total semiconductor market of around $340 billion, the industrial sector is estimated to have accounted for about 12% of the overall semiconductor market in 2015, a larger proportion than the automotive sector. Texas Instruments was the leading vendor of semiconductors to the industrial sector in 2015, ahead of Infineon Technologies. Intel passed STMicroelectronics to become the third largest vendor following the acquisition of Altera, with Renesas Electronics completing the top five. • According to IC Insights, the IC industry’s original system-on-chip (SoC) product category – microcontrollers – is expected to steadily reach record-high annual revenues through the second half of this decade, despite an overall slowdown in unit growth during the next five years. Microcontroller sales barely increased in 2015, rising less than a half percent, to set a new record high of slightly more than $15,9 billion, thanks to a 15% increase in MCU shipments that lifted worldwide unit volumes to an all-time peak of 22,1 billion last year. IC Insights forecasts MCU sales will rise in 2016 to nearly $16,6 billion, which is a 4% increase over 2015. MCU unit volumes are expected to grow by 2% in 2016 to 22,4 billion, and the average selling price is forecast to rise 2% to $0,74. • A host of next-generation Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacon and ultra-wideband (UWB) technologies threaten to dramatically disrupt the real-time location system (RTLS) and asset tracking markets. ABI Research forecasts that new solutions, along with the arrival of industrial IoT, will result in a combined RTLS and asset tracking market that more than triples from its current size to reach $15 billion in 2021. Traditional technologies like active RFiD, Wi-Fi and legacy UWB will still have a place, but will be increasingly marginalised, particularly as smartphones and wearables become more predominant in industrial spaces. ABI Research forecasts a 5:1 ratio on new RTLS technology tags versus traditional RTLS technologies by 2021, with significant growth into new greenfield applications like pallet tracking, condition monitoring and inventory management. Technology • Nokia Bell Labs, Deutsche Telekom T-Labs and the Technical University of Munich have employed a new modulation technique to achieve an unprecedented 1 Tbps data transmission rate over a deployed optical fibre network. This is close to the theoretical maximum information transfer rate of that channel and thus approaching the Shannon Limit of the fibre link. The trial of the novel modulation approach, known as probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS), uses quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) formats to achieve higher transmission capacity and significantly improve the spectral efficiency of optical communications. University of Wisconsin–Madison materials engineers have created carbon nanotube transistors that outperform state-of-the-art silicon transistors. • University of Wisconsin–Madison materials engineers have, for the first time, created carbon nanotube transistors that outperform state-of-the-art silicon transistors, achieving current that’s 1,9 times higher than their silicon counterparts. This advance could pave the way for carbon nanotube transistors to replace silicon transistors and continue delivering the performance gains the electronics industry relies on and that consumers demand. The new transistors are particularly promising for wireless communications technologies that require a lot of current flowing across a relatively small area. • UK company Peratech was honoured in the Corporate Vision 2016 Technology Innovator Awards for its force sensing technology. The company’s technology is based on quantum tunnelling composite (QTC) materials, which change their electrical resistance based on how much force or pressure is applied to it—from light touch to hard press. Its current ink formulations can be applied to any surface (even laminated wood) and use semiconductive nanoparticles that are carefully blended with other particles in a polymer binder that makes the resulting force sensors durable and reliable at high and low temperatures, and in high-humidity conditions. • ARM has launched a new real-time processor with advanced safety features for autonomous vehicles and medical and industrial robots. The Cortex-R52 was designed to address functional safety in systems that must comply with ISO 26262 ASIL D and IEC 61508 SIL 3, the most stringent safety standards in the automotive and industrial markets. STMicroelectronics is the first ARM partner to announce it has licensed the processor for highly integrated SoCs for the automotive market.           << Previous article   Next article >> Mobile | Classic

Stocks slip as investors digest data, earnings; energy lags CNBC 10/17/2016 Fred Imbert © Provided by CNBC U.S. stocks traded slightly lower on Monday as investors digested a number of corporate results, key economic data while keeping an eye on the Federal Reserve. "I think the market needs to get assurance from Corporate America. They want to know that things are getting better," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "This is still a market that's trying to figure out whether it wants to break higher or lower." Quotes in the article International Business Machines Corp IBM ▲ 158.67 +0.46 +0.29% Hasbro Inc HAS ▼ 85.43 -1.77 -2.03% Netflix Inc NFLX ▲ 113.59 +0.21 +0.19% Charles Schwab Corp SCHW ▲ 37.20 +0.44 +1.20% The Dow Jones industrial average fell about 15 points, with McDonald's and Merck contributing the most losses. The S&P 500 slipped 0.1 percent, with energy leading decliners. U.S. crude fell more than 1 percent to $49.80 per barrel, weighed by a rising rig count in the United States. "A pullback unfolded last week, leading to a successful test of initial support near 2115 by the SPX. Short-term momentum has weakened, but oversold conditions are widespread enough to suggest that the pullback will mature this week," Katie Stockton, chief technical strategist at BTIG, said in a Monday note. The Nasdaq fell 0.14 percent, as shares of Apple and the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) dropped 0.4 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively. At the open, the three major indexes hovered around the flatline. Banking giant Bank of America and toymaker Hasbro were among the firms reporting quarterly earnings before the bell. Both firms beat Wall Street estimates. IBM and Netflix are among the companies scheduled to release results after the close on Monday. Earnings season has gotten off to a good start. Of the 34 S&P 500 companies that had reported as of Friday morning, 79 percent had beaten Wall Street estimates for earnings per share, according to Nick Raich of The Earnings Scout. Last week, banking giants JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo all reported better-than-expected profits and sales. Investors also digested industrial production data, which showed a 0.1 percent increase in September, slightly below a consensus estimate of 0.2 percent. Meanwhile, the New York Fed's Empire State business conditions showed manufacturing in the state contracted for the third straight month. "Manufacturing production in the US has basically flat lined over the past two years and there are no signs that will change anytime soon to the upside," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group. Investors have been heavily scrutinizing U.S. economic data, as well as remarks from key Fed officials, gauging the likelihood the central bank raises rates before year's end. Later on Monday, Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer is scheduled to speak at the Economic Club of New York. A slew of economic data is scheduled for release later this week, including CPI, housing starts and the Beige Book. "I think the most important report this week will be the CPI report. I think it will show inflation further rising here," said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. He added the report would carry added weight after Fed Chair Janet Yellen's speech on Friday. Yellen said it's useful to consider the benefits of a "high-pressure economy," adding the post-financial crisis period has pushed policymakers into reconsidering the dynamics of inflation. Overseas, Chinese GDP, retail sales and industrial profits are all scheduled for release on Wednesday. Last week, U.S. stocks were weighed down by a surprise fall in Chinese exports. "It's pretty clear that China is bumping along the bottom. When we'll see a turnaround, that's unknown," said Maris Ogg, president at Tower Bridge Advisors. But "when you talk to companies that have boots on the ground, ... I think that's gives better color on the data." Ogg pointed specifically to Caterpillar, which is scheduled to report quarterly results next week. Elsewhere, U.S. Treasury yields slipped but remained close to recent highs, with the two-year note yield around 0.82 percent and the 10-year yield near 1.77 percent. The U.S. dollar fell slightly against a basket of currencies, with the euro steady below $1.10 and the yen just below 104. —CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.

But scientists are having trouble scaling up these systems to a useful size for applications such as artificial intelligence (AI). Now scientists have developed the first ever 'quantum bridge', which could link lots of small quantum computers together.  The discovery opens up the potential to create more powerful AI systems through the development of quantum computing.  Scientists have developed the first ever 'quantum bridge', which could link lots of small quantum computers together. This illustration of a quantum bridge shows an array of holes etched in diamond with two silicon atoms placed between the holes QUANTUM COMPUTING  Quantum computing takes advantage of the ability of subatomic particles to exist in more than one state at any time. In traditional computers, data is expressed in one of two states – known as binary bits – which are either a 1 or a 0. But quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits. These can exist in both of these states at once, meaning many computations can be performed in parallel. The idea is often explained using a sphere. A classical computer could be in a state at either of the two poles of the sphere.  But in a quantum bit, the state can be any point on the sphere's surface.  For example, two qubits can encode four different values while a three qubit system encodes eight different values. Quantum computing takes advantage of the ability of subatomic particles to exist in more than one state at any time. In traditional computers, data is expressed in one of two states – known as binary bits – which are either a 1 or a 0. But quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits. Computations in a quantum computer occur when qubits interact with each other, therefore for a computer to function it needs to have many qubits.  One of the main reason why quantum computers are so hard to manufacture is that scientists still have not found a simple way to control complex systems of qubits.  But the researchers behind the new quantum bridge say it would overcome this problem by linking small quantum computers, instead of just building one large one. 'People have already built small quantum computers,' said Ryan Camacho, researcher at Sandia National Laboratories in Carlsbad, California, and leader of the research.  'Maybe the first useful one won't be a single giant quantum computer but a connected cluster of small ones.'

Share this article Share 183 shares The new bridge is created by adding impurities into diamond.  The work, which was joint with Harvard University, used a focused ion beam implanter at Sandia's Ion Beam Laboratory. The beam is designed for blasting single ions into specific locations on a diamond substrate. The researchers replaced on carbon atom in the diamond with one silicon atom, which causes the carbon atoms around the silicon to 'flee'. This leaves the silicon atoms with a lot of space, and even though they are in a solid material, they behave as if they are in a gas. The idea of quantum computing is often explained using a sphere, called the Bloch Sphere (pictured). A classical computer could be in a state at either of the two poles of the sphere (0 or 1). But in a quantum bit, the state can be any point on the sphere's surface 'What we've done is implant the silicon atoms exactly where we want them,' said Camacho.  'We can create thousands of implanted locations, which all yield working quantum devices, because we plant the atoms well below the surface of the substrate and anneal them in place.  'Before this, researchers had to search for emitter atoms among about 1,000 randomly occurring defects — that is, non-carbon atoms — in a diamond substrate of a few microns to find even one that emitted strongly enough to be useful at the single photon level.'  When the silicon atoms are settled in the diamond substrate, laser-generated photons bump silicon electrons into their a higher atomic energy state. The electrons return to the lower energy state, because all things seek the lowest possible energy level. When this happens, they spit out quantized photons that carry information through their frequency, intensity and the polarization of their wave. 'Harvard researchers performed that experiment, as well as the optical and quantum measurements,' said Camacho.  'We did the novel device fabrication and came up with a clever way to count exactly how many ions are implanted into the diamond substrate.'  ABANDONING MOORE'S LAW  It has been a guiding principal for the computer industry for decades, but it seems Moore's Law is becoming obsolete. The law, which predicts that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit will double every two years, is no longer achievable according to experts in February this year. The semiconductor industry, which has used the observation as its target development in recent decades, is now set to abandon the approach. In 1965 Gordon Moore, the co-founder of microchip giant Intel, described how the number of components on an integrated circuit was doubling every year In 1965 Gordon Moore, the co-founder of microchip giant Intel, described how the number of components on an integrated circuit was doubling every year. He projected this growth rate would continue for at least another decade before in 1975 he revised the forecast to a doubling every two years. His prediction has proved accurate, partly because the semiconductor industry has adopted it as a target for future research and development. By 2012 the size of a single integrate circuit had fallen to 22 nanometres. However, as transistors have decreased in size, manufacturers have been faced with a growing battle against issues such as heat that can reduce the efficiency of a chip. In 2015, Intel confirmed the pace of advancement had slowed with the doubling rate now occurring once every two and a half years. The company also announced it was working on chips that feature circuits just 7 nanometres in size. But many expect transistors to reach a fundamental limit as they begin to reach atomic and quantum levels of size.

However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats.

By Wesley Yin-Poole Published 17/10/2016 The new Call of Duty lets you end a competitive multiplayer match with a devastating nuke - but it's rock hard to trigger. The Infinite Warfare beta has been running over the weekend, and players have got to use the De-Atomizer Strike - a 25-kill streak ability that, if triggered, ends a match by obliterating all the players. The video, below, shows the graphical effect in action. A dropship appears overhead as a countdown alarm warns players of the impending doom. Then a bright light and flash... Now, the De-Atomizer Strike is tricky to activate. First, you must use variants of certain weapons that have the Nuclear perk. As detailed by Charlie Intel, here are the weapons in the beta that have the perk as an option on their Legendary variant: Mauler - Ruin NV4 - Fallout EBR-800 - Purge DCM-8 - Purifier EMC - Calamity Then, of course, you need to get a 25-kill streak, which doesn't happen every day. The De-Atomizer Strike is a nice nod to the Tactical Nuke, an unlockable killstreak reward in Infinity Ward's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. That also required 25 consecutive kills.

SamMobile has now learned that Samsung will unveil the new tablet in Q1 2017 and there'll be two models. Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 review: A genuine iPad rival? The two model numbers are SM-T820 and SM-T285, the former being a wi-fi only model while the SM-T285 will support 3G and 4G mobile connectivity. That's the only information SamMobile has for now though, nothing is known about the screen size, processor, camera or other specs. If you can't wait until next year to get a new Galaxy tablet fix, then you'll be pleased to know there's now a Gold Edition of the TabPro S 2-in-1 hybrid. Not only will the tablet/laptop hybrid come in a new gold finish, but the specs have been upgraded to 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD and 10.5 hour battery. Samsung Galaxy TabPro S review: Taking on the Microsoft Surface Pro Elsewhere it's business as usual: 12-inch Super AMOLED display and 2.2GHz Intel M3 processor.

SAN FRANCISCO, October 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The globalflywheel energy storage marketis projected to reach USD 477.8 million by 2024, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc. Increasing demand for uninterrupted power supply and growing energy storage industry are expected to fuel the growth of this market. Flywheel systems store and regulate electricity by spinning continuously and hence are used for the majority of the frequency regulation applications. The major difference between photovoltaic solar cells and the flywheel storage systems is that the latter can produce power throughout the day and night. (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150105/723757 ) The data centers segment held the largest share of 16% in terms of applications in 2015. Growing energy storage industry in the U.S. and the European region projected to drive the market. Growing demand for uninterruptible power supply, particularly from the industrial sector, has provided much-needed momentum. Browse full research report with TOC on "Flywheel Energy Storage Market Analysis By Application (UPS, Distributed Energy Generation, Transport, Data Centers,) And Segment Forecasts To 2024" at: http://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/flywheel-energy-storage-market Further key findings from the report suggest The data centers segment is projected to dominate this industry from 2016 to 2024 and is estimated to reach over USD 65 million by 2024, growing at a CAGR of 7.2%. Continuous, uninterrupted power is a primary requirement for data centers, for which, flywheel energy storage systems are used. Growing commercial workstations, which require a large amount of data to be stored centrally, are driving the market in this application segment. Growing cloud-enabled IT services are expected to propel demand for data centers, thus influencing market growth. Distributed energy generation is projected to be the fastest growing application segment at a CAGR of 12% from 2016 to 2024. Low cost of power transmission, reduced complexity, and higher efficiency are key characteristics of DEG systems that are preferred over a conventional generation. Also, this method is expected to provide a boost to the use of renewable sources for power generation and reduce the dependency on fossil fuels. North America was the largest market for flywheel energy storage systems in 2015, with a share of more than 77%. It is projected to witness a steady CAGR from 2016 to 2024. Since this region is home to some of the major IT companies such as Oracle, Cisco Systems, Intel Corp, Google and Microsoft that need storage of large amounts of data centrally, the demand from the data centers segment is projected to increase, by 2024. Active Power, Amber Kinetics, Inc., Beacon Power, LLC, and Calnetix Technologies, LLC account for the majority of the share in this industry. Other important players include Piller Group GmbH, Powerthru, Power Tree, Temporal Power, and Rotonix USA. Agreements, collaborations, and joint ventures were the most commonly adopted development strategies by these players between 2011 and 2016, in order to consolidate their positions in the industry.

Had you been an adult male traveling in third class, your chances would have been a lot slimmer than those of men in upper class, not to mention women and children. Predicting future outcomes based on past statistical figures is called predictive modeling, or predictive analytics.   Olivier Duchenne (left) and Sophie Eom are the co-founders of Korean machine learning-based data mining solution startup Solidware. Solidware Combined with information technologies, such as machine learning and big data, the predictive modeling skills can now roll out better forecasts since it can factor in as many variables as possible in analyzing data. On the business front, such improvement in data analysis, or data mining, can mean saving huge costs by accurately gauging future risks. Very few businesses are, however, effectively making use of solutions merged with those big data and machine learning technologies in their day-to-day businesses, and especially so in the financial sector that have to have top-tier prediction models to prevent financial risks. “Many think big data -- one of the biggest buzz words in the IT sector -- is somewhere out there, not within their companies,” said Sophie Eom, the CEO of machine learning-based data mining solution provider Solidware, adding “Financial institutions, banks, insurance firms, and credit rating agencies are actually sitting on the treasure trove of data, but they are tapping less than 10 percent of it while the rest is unexplored.” The current risk management solutions of financial firms look into just a dozen information categories when selling insurance or lending money, such as a type of job, age, and marital status, while there are thousands of different data sets available to make an accurate forecast for who will likely go bankrupt or be in arrears, according to the 29-year-old CEO, who founded the startup with her husband Olivier Duchenne in August 2014. The company’s DAVinCI LABS boasts an easy user interface, allowing users to see the results of data analysis in line graph and histogram with just several mouse clicks. The solution’s automatic clustering, which groups data that have similar traits automatically, is a feature that cannot be found in any other data analytics solution, Eom said. For example, the solution automatically categorizes the people who were aboard the Titanic according to their gender, age, and travel class. The DAVinCI LABS solution, which proved to be effective in saving costs in a pilot project with AXA Korea, the local subsidiary of French insurer AXA, will be integrated into its system to screen new customers. In the pilot project, the solution showed that it could have saved 8 billion won (US$7.1 million) of costs for the insurance company by preemptively eliminating financial risks. Depending on the results of the partnership with AXA Korea, the insurance firm’s French head office can employ the analytics solution. “Among many programs tested at AXA’s global offices, only Solidware’s solution has rolled out positive results in saving costs,” said Eom, who used to work at AXA Korea before founding the startup. Man behind big data solution Solidware made it to the top 10 in its maiden participation in a Startups 2016 competition, a sideline event of the ICT Spring Europe startup conference held in Luxembourg in May. It also flexed its muscles in an online data analytics competition on Kaggle, a platform where researchers and companies contest with their data analytic capabilities. Predicting the survival rate of people aboard the Titanic, mentioned above, is an actual task of the ongoing competition. With just a single minute of test run to calculate the survival rate on the platform, DAVinCI LABS, without any optimization work, ranked in the top 3.5 percent among 5,200 participants, according to Solidware. Eom’s husband Duchenne is the man behind the development of the powerful solution. A prominent artificial intelligence researcher who won the best prize for his thesis on computer vision at the Computer Vision Pattern Recognition conference in 2009, Duchenne attracted seasoned experts in AI and machine learning to join the Korean startup. Co-founder Duchenne used to work as a postdoctoral fellow for AI research at Carnegie Mellon University. He also worked as a researcher at Aldebaran Robotics, a robot company owned by Softbank of Japan, and at Intel Korea before establishing Solidware. Like many new startups, the co-founders started from the bottom up. In order to save office rent fees, they worked and had meals at their home together with their employees in the early stage until the company was acquired by Yello Financial Group, a fintech firm alliance, in March 2015. “Duchenne has always wanted to apply his expertise in technology to the real world instead of only doing research at a lab,” said Eom, adding it was lucky to have him in Solidware since he was the one who attracted talented, seasoned AI and machine learning researchers into the team. The 2-year-old startup was able to make money from its early business stage -- unusual for a fledgling startup -- and is expected to see its sales further increase with the planned global business expansion. The Korean startup is planning to tap into Southeast Asia where the predictive modeling business is less competitive and advanced analysis solutions are in great need for the growing financial and banking sector in the regions. Other destinations include Japan. The company is in talks with a Japanese financial firm for partnership. In Korea, KB Capital, Shinhan Bank, Welcome Savings Bank and AXA are currently deploying Solidware’s product in analyzing the data of their customers and Hyundai Card and SBI Savings Bank running a pilot project with Solidware’s solutions. CEO Eom said that she believes problem-driven thinking have played an integral role in the firm’s smooth voyage in the startup world where most are scrambling to break even, or, in a bad case, just waiting to be acquired by bigger firms. “Rather than trying to do something with technical skills you have, you have to find some pain points in society and try to solve them with your own capability, or sometimes with the help of others” said CEO Eom, who studied chemistry and business management at Seoul National University and got an MBA degree from HEC Paris. She said the company will try to deploy its DAVinCI LABS solution in other sectors including gaming and medicine. In the future, the solution could be used to help, for example, doctors to know probability of a patient getting a certain disease, or economists to make more accurate prediction on economic conditions for the coming years.

Benchmark Awards Reports Blogs Topics CXO Challenge Whitepapers What's On Tech giants join forces for faster server tech By Juha Saarinen on Oct 17, 2016 12:00PM OpenCAPI to provide ten-fold performance boost. Google and a group of IT hardware companies have joined forces to develop the open coherent accelerator processor interface (OpenCAPI) specification, providing a foundation for high-speed microprocessor interconnect systems to devices. The open interface architecture is based on IBM's CAPI for POWER8 processors. OpenCAPI will however be processor design-agnostic.  The idea is to allow fast, direct connections between applications and user-level hardware accelerators and advanced memory systems for cloud servers and big data and analytics. OpenCAPI does away with the need to run device drivers and communication with accelerators over a bus like PCIe, which adds latency and slows performance. Hardware acceleration will become more commonplace thanks to microprocessor technology no longer delivering the historical cost/performance improvement for each new generation, OpenCAPI's founding board - consisting of AMD, IBM, Google, Mellanox and Micron - said in a technology overview [pdf]. The initiative has also attracted Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Nvidia, and Xilinix as contributors, while Dell-EMC has joined as an observer. The world's largest microprocessor maker, Intel, is not part of the OpenCAPI consortium and is not expected join. "As artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced analytics become the price of doing business in today's digital era, huge volumes of data are now the norm," Doug Balog, general manager for IBM Power, told Reuters. "It's clear that today's datacenters can no longer rely on one company alone to drive innovation." IBM will feature OpenCAPI in its POWER9 products due out next year, the company's research fellow Brad McCredie said. OpenCAPI will feature 25 gigabit per second signalling and a protocol that enables a very low latency interface between processors and attached devices. The consortium intends to deliver the OpenCAPI 3.0 specification and an interface reference design for field-programmable gate array accelerators by mid-2017. Copyright © iTnews.com.au .

Politics World ASEAN Society Business Culture - Sports Sci-Tech Health Environment Travel Destinations Festival Tours Discovery Vietnamplus Search × Categories Politics World ASEAN Society Business Culture - Sports Sci-Tech Health Environment Travel Destinations Festival Tours Media Center Photo Video Timeline Wednesday, November 16, 2016 - 14:26:15 Thang Long - Hanoi Tiếng Việt  |  English  |  Français  |  Español  |  中文 Society Better solar power policy needed: experts VNA Sunday, October 16, 2016 - 16:16:30 Print Solar cells at a water supply plant in An Phu Trung commune, southern Ben Tre province (Photo: VNA) Hanoi (VNA) - Investors have been looking for a synchronous policy to address difficulties faced in solar power projects in Vietnam. Chairman of Son Ha Group Le Vinh Son said that investors were interested in solar power projects in Vietnam but faced difficulties because of non-synchronous policies. The difficulties included few legal frameworks, mechanisms and human resource for the production and application of renewable energy, he said. Solar power projects usually required huge investment, resulting in high power costs which made solar power less competitive than other power types, he said. Son said that solar power projects were costly but investors found it difficult to get loans, even preferential loans which are designed to encourage science and technology projects. Chairman and General Director of Red Sun Energy Joint Stocks Company Diep Bao Canh said that so far, few credit institutions or banks had schemes to develop human resources for assessing and approving credit to solar power projects. Dr Nguyen Huy Hoach from the Vietnam Clean Energy Association said that Vietnam had great potential for solar energy, particularly in the Central Highlands region and south central provinces with an average 2,000-2,600 hours of sunlight each year. It has average solar irradiance of 4-5 kWh/squ.m/day, which is comparable to Thailand and the Philippines, which have more developed solar markets in the region. However, in Vietnam, solar energy was little used, just for households, water-boiling system, lighting and drying, he said. Tang The Hung, vice head of Planning Division under General Directorate of Energy, said so far Vietnam had no commercial solar power generating project despite the country wanting to increase solar power productivity from a few MW now to 850MW in 2020 and 4,000 MW in 2025. Hung said that two months ago, the Ministry of Industry and Trade submitted a proposal on solar power price to the Prime Minister. Under the proposal, the Government would subsidise 3,150 VND (15 USD cents) per kWh to rooftop solar power projects. To other on-grid solar power projects, each kWh would be paid 2,352 VND (11.2 USD cents). The projects must have solar cells with efficiency higher than 16 percent and productivity of less than 100 MW. Until now, about 4MW of solar power is used in Vietnam with few systems including the 200kWp system of Intel in the HCM City Hi-tech Zone, a 140 kWp system in Tan Tao Industrial Zone and a 212 kWP system on the rooftop parking area of Big C supermarket in southern Binh Duong Province. Previously, the ministry proposed Electricity of Vietnam (EVN) buy solar power at 11.2 cent per kWh but investors said the price was too low, being lower than the price that the EVN buys electricity from small hydro power plants during rush hours – 12.38 cent. The United Nations Development Programme, in its report in May, 2016, suggested regulating a “Feed-in-Tariff” of 15 USD cents/ kWh for mainland solar photovoltaic (PV) power plants, and 19 USD cents/ kWh for power plants on islands, over a period of 20 years. The organisation also recommended financial support for-grid and off-grid solar PV systems in remote areas and islands as well as incentives to reduce investment costs of solar PV power plants, “rooftop” and community solar PV systems. Dr Duong Duy Hoat from the Institute of Energy Science said a law on renewable energy is needed to ensure sustainable development of renewable energy. The Government needs to instruct ministries, sectors and localities to plan for developing renewable energy on the basis of forecasts of demand and supply. Developing national criteria and regulations on renewable energy is also necessary, Hoat said, adding that a fund should be established to ensure financial resources for renewable energy research and development. Incentives should be offered to encourage international and domestic enterprises to participate in the sector, while promoting communications to raise public awareness of value of renewable energy in sustainable development, according to Hoat. The revised Vietnam Power Development Planning in 2011-2020 with an outlook to 2030, approved by the Prime Minister in March, 2016, has given priority to developing renewable energy sources, step by step raising the share of renewable energy in national electricity output to 7 percent in 2020 and over 10 percent by 2030. Total hydropower capacity is expected to reach 21,600 MW by 2020 from the current 17,000 MW, and to 24,600 MW and 27,800 MW by 2025 and 2030, respectively. The hydropower output will account for 29.5 percent, 20.5 percent and 15.5 percent of total electricity generation in 2020, 2025 and 2030, respectively. The planning also aims to raise wind energy capacity from 140 MW now to 800 MW by 2020, accounting for 0.8 percent of total electricity output.-VNA Related News Vietnam needs solar energy policies Japanese company to develop solar electricity in Binh Phuoc Renewable energy may power Vietnam by 2050 Danish-funded project provides solar power to Ben Tre waterworks Incentives for solar power expansion discussed solar power clean energy renewable energy Your comments about this article ...

Mumbai, Oct 16:   Sony Max, the Hindi movie channel from Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN), has made history of sorts by grossing Rs 50 crore in ad revenue from television première of the Salman Khan-starrer “Sultan”. The Yash Raj Films-produced movie, released on July 6, has already raked in Rs 585 crore in worldwide box office collection (Rs 421 crore from the domestic market alone) and the channel claims this is the highest television première collection for the company ever. The movie was premièred last night and the inventory was sold out days ahead of the show-time. “It is one of the biggest blockbusters and it has been the biggest movie for us in terms of revenue. It is the highest grossing movie revenue which we have got, but we can’t disclose the revenue,” SPN President (Sales and International Business) Rohit Gupta told PTI here. However, according to sources, SPN has garnered Rs 50 crore from the première. Gupta also declined to divulge the deal size for the movie rights but according to media reports, SPN acquired the satellite rights for Rs 61 crore for five years. The broadcaster had sold all the inventory well before airing the movie last night. The ad rates were Rs 10 lakh for 10 seconds for standard definition channel Sony Max and Rs 2 lakh per 10 seconds for the HD channel Sony Max HD. Chinese handset maker Oppo and Reliance Jio were the co-presenters, while FMCG major Hindustan Unilever and auto major Mahindra were the co-sponsors. Bajaj Auto, Colgate, Mondelez, Reckitt Benckiser and Samsung Electronics came on board as the associate sponsors, while Apple, eBay India, Ford India, Google India, Huawei Tele, Intel, Intex Technologies, Lenovo, L’oreal, Pernod Ricard, Raymond and Vivo Mobiles were the spot buyers. Neeraj Vyas, business head for Hindi movies and music cluster at SPN, acknowledged that it is the highest SPN has ever done in the history of any film being premièred on the network in terms of revenue. He added that it had hiked rates by 20 per cent since the last major television première of “Bahubali”. “We’ve had an increase in ad rates, which is why the numbers have gone up to what they have. It was 20 per cent higher over the previous large movie première that we had sold last year around the same time for Bahubali,” Vyas said, adding this was the first time a movie was premièred simultaneously on Sony Max and Sony Max HD. He further said “Sultan” will have at least two or three runs on Sony Max before being aired on the network’s another channel Sony Waah.

Carmel, but Neot Peres has brought them down to the shoreline. Nimrod Bousso Oct 17, 2016 12:54 PM comments Print   Zen Subscribe now  Shareshare on facebook  Tweet send via email reddit stumbleupon Looking up at Mt. Carmel from the Bahai Center.Eyal Toueg Just why are Israeli homes so badly designed? Construction finance banker doubtful that home prices will fall Elderly housing in Israel: No country for old men (or old women) A mound of construction refuse left over from the excavation of the Carmel Tunnels greeted participants of an Israel Lands Authority contractors’ tour in January 2013, at a site at the foot of the Carmel Mountains. At the time, the site was called Haifa - the Western Approaches. The developed area of the city was mostly far away, but for the skeleton of a new municipal stadium. More than a few participants wondered whether they were wasting their time. Everyone in Haifa knows that the residents of the top of Mt. Carmel are in no hurry to leave, and that the only reason for a downhill trip is to visit the Hadar Quarter, only about halfway down the mountain. These people aren’t known to like flatlands and even the contractors who ultimately submitted proposals to buy land at the Western Approaches site did so cautiously. The bids were strikingly low. The assumption was that the location would yield prices of an affordable 800,000 to 1 million shekels ($210,000 to $270,000) per home. Three and a half years later, prices have soared by about 50%, and it is hard for anyone to remember the low expectations when the project was launched. Defying tradition, middle class Haifa residents jumped at the opportunity and were not put off when the prices began to climb. The buyers included local celebrities such as Itamar Chizik, CEO of the Maccabi Haifa soccer team, and former player turned commentator Eyal Berkovic. When the late Shimon Peres stepped down as Israel’s president, the Haifa Municipality decided to name the neighborhood after him, calling it Neot Peres. Yaki Amsalem, CEO of Almog CDAI Limited, says he detected interest in the site the summer of 2013 even before sales got underway. The company had intended to offer only 100 of the 288 apartments it had built for advance sale, but within 10 days these units were all sold, and the entire inventory was sold in less than two months. Neot Peres under construction.Eyal Toueg Prices settling down Real estate sources say things settled down more recently as prices hit the  1.3 million to 1.4 million shekel range for four-room apartments, and the starting price for five-room apartments climbed to 1.6 million shekels. About 80% of the homes in the neighborhood had been sold as of late August. The initial target population was young couples buying a first home, but the neighborhood has also become a magnet for investors, who Amsalem says account for about a third of buyers, though about a third of these have ended up moving into the neighborhood. Yossi Avrahami, who is building about 400 housing units in the neighborhood, says it has also become popular with families downsizing as their adult children leave home. “Downsizers from the Carmel, including private home owners in Denya [an upscale neighborhood on the top of the Carmel], are selling their house to move closer to the sea,” he remarks. He sold 320 units as of late August. “There was a real hunger for a big, new neighborhood in the city, and that explains the pace of sales there,” says Varda Libman, director of Haifa’s planning department. Libman says it has been decades since such a large number of homes went on the market in Haifa all at once. “Most of the new neighborhoods in the city have been planned on privately owned land with a large number of owners, and we have had no control there over the pace of the work. It’s generally small contractors building a few units on such land. In that respect, the new neighborhood was big news for the city,” she says, All told, Neot Peres will feature about 1,700 apartments in buildings ranging from seven to 17 stories high. The first residents took possession of the first 144 apartments, developed by CDAI Almog, in April and about 300 more units will have been occupied by around the end of this month. Shectmann & Company is developing another 200 units and the Ashtrom Group, 268 units, of which 142 are designated for long-term rentals. “We instructed the Israel Lands Authority to market to as many as developers as possible, so there would be competition and construction would proceed quickly,” Libman says. “We had had a bad experience with the Ramat Hanasi neighborhood, where the number of apartments is similar but the land was owned by one developer who built one at a time taking breaks in between. When there’s competition, the contractors rush forward and you can see it in the pace of progress of construction.” Neot Peres is seen as a harbinger of a massive construction wave expected to change Haifa’s landscape from Freud Road in the northwest to the southern suburb of Tirat Hacarmel. The entire foot of Carmel slope is expected to be developed at an unprecedented scope. Some 14,000 housing units are planned. More building planned “There’s a plan to build 770 housing units on the slope of the mountain – adjoining Neot Peres from the east – and it has already been approved, and the land will be marketed to developers in the coming months,” says Libman. “A more significant, larger plan, for the construction of another 4,400 housing units to the south of Neot Peres was submitted to the district planning and building committee, which will consider it for public comment in the coming months,” she adds. In addition to being the first new neighborhood in Haifa in decades, the location of Neot Peres is more attractive than it seems at a glance. Although it’s a bit isolated, it is close to Matam, Haifa’s high-tech center, where 10,000 people work in research and development centers run by Intel, Elbit Systems, Google, Microsoft and Apple. Plans are now being made to expand the high-tech office park. Also nearby are the Haifa Mall and the Castra shopping mall, a portion of which is expected to be converted into small hotel, city officials say. The huge Sammy Ofer municipal soccer stadium adjoins Neot Peres from the west. Some worry that the stadium will bring noise, crowds and traffic to the area, but, Libman says, the municipality doesn’t foresee any particular problems. “We have created a buffer with a public area between the neighborhood and the stadium, where kindergartens and schools will be located, so there are several hundred meters separating the stadium from the closest homes.” Traffic will be diverted On days in which there are soccer games, spectator traffic will be diverted to a separate route, away from the neighborhood, she says. From the standpoint of public transportation, the neighborhood is well-located. It is close to Route 2, which runs to Tel Aviv, and to Route 4, which provides easy access to the center of the country. There is also easy access to the Carmel Tunnels, which serve the metropolitan Haifa area. In the future, the east of Neot Peres will be linked to the neighborhoods on the slopes of the Carmel Mountain and southward to the neighborhoods slated to extend toward Tirat Hacarmel. The neighborhood is also near the Hof Hacarmel bus station, one of the city’s largest, and a train station. People buying homes in Neot Peres may have reason to be concerned about the lack of community institutions and public spaces at the moment. Although residents are already moving in, construction of schools and kindergartens is just in its initial stages. Basics like playgrounds and even good sidewalks are not in place. The place feels more like a construction site than a community. By the end of the year, however, about 500 apartments will be occupied, which should bring hundreds of children into the neighborhood. In August the Haifa Municipality promised that six kindergartens would be opened in Neot Peres next year and an elementary school now under construction is scheduled to open in September 2018. Until they open, neighborhood children will be placed at nearby schools, the municipality says, with 95% of infrastructure work so far running ahead of the schedule. Sidewalks and open public areas are scheduled for completion by July 2017.

Buyer’s Guide Technology update Oct 17, 2016 Silicon makes good qubit material Ordinary silicon, the material that has dominated the semiconductor industry for decades, could also make a very promising host material for quantum bits in a future quantum computer. So say researchers at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands and the University of Wisconsin at Madison in the US, who have found that electrically controlled silicon-based qubits are 100 times more robust than those based on the compound semiconductor gallium arsenide. Two spinning electrons in a quantum dot “The silicon-based qubit can also be manipulated with 10 times greater precision than qubits based on GaAS, which has been widely used to make qubits in the past,” explains team leader Lieven Vandersypen. A quantum computer will be able to solve certain computational problems – such as factoring large numbers or simulating complex chemical reactions as well as the interactions between large numbers of fundamental particles – exponentially faster and more efficiently than a current classical computer can. The building block of a quantum computer is a quantum bit (or qubit), which is the quantum analogue of the conventional binary digit (bit). In principle, powerful quantum computers can be built from a collection of qubits. For a qubit based on an electron spin, for example, these states would be "spin up" and "spin down", with one state representing a logical "1" and the other "0". Each qubit can be in a superposition of two quantum states at the same time and N qubits could be quantum-mechanically entangled to represent 2N values simultaneously. This would lead to the parallel processing of information on a massive scale that is simply not possible with conventional computers. Bit errors However, quantum computers are extremely fragile, and a computation can be easily destroyed by "bit errors" in the qubit state that occur when external noise in the environment affects the values of the qubits. While it is proving very difficult to create practical qubits that are robust enough to eliminate such errors, an alternative approach is to accept that errors will occur and to try to correct for them as the quantum calculation progresses. Now, Vandersypen and colleagues have made an important advance here by studying the qubit performance of an electron spin in an Si/SiGe quantum dot (a semiconductor structure just tens of nm across) and looking into the dominant error mechanisms in it. The researchers have found that they can electrically control the Si/SiGe-based qubit with sufficient accuracy so that remaining errors could, in principle, be corrected using known protocols To use the electron spin as a qubit, they trapped one single electron in the quantum dot. The trap is based on the different material properties of Si and SiGe, explains Vandersypen, and on small electric fields from tiny metal electrodes on the substrate surface. Electrically controlling quit spin “Normally, spins are controlled with oscillating magnetic fields (like what is done, for instance, in MRI equipment in hospitals),” he says. “We controlled the spin of our qubit electrically. We place a small magnet next to the quantum dot and apply an oscillating electric field via one of the electrodes that forms the quantum dot. The oscillating electric field wiggles the electron position back and forth, and thanks to the magnetic field varying with position, the electron experiences an oscillating magnetic field, which allows us to control the spin.” When placed in an arbitrary state, the qubit stays in that state for a microsecond, which is about 100 times longer than for a GaAs qubit, he tells nanotechweb.org. “With additional control signals to further stabilize the qubit state, we can extend this to 0.4 ms. What is more, we have quantified the probability of errors when we try to manipulate the state, and find that this probability is only about 1%.” A collaboration with Intel A 1% error probability during qubit manipulation is at the threshold of what is required to make a large-scale quantum computer, adds team member Susan Coppersmith. “The relatively long lifetime of the qubit memory of 0.4 ms also facilitates scaling up, proving that silicon is in fact a very attractive material for implementing electron spin qubits and we expect that it will generate a great deal of interest.” Indeed, as if to prove this point, Intel Corporation entered the quantum computing arena last year and started a long-term collaboration with Vandersypen’s team. The team, reporting its work in PNAS doi: 10.1073/pnas.1603251113, says that it is now busy looking into how best to couple several spin qubits together. “Moreover, we must develop the technology to scale up to a large number of (nearly) identical qubits – and this is an area where players like Intel can make a difference, since their high-quality nano-fabrication processes are optimized to be extremely reproducible,” says Coppersmith.

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Search Business Politics Technology VF Summit 2016 Election Sam Altman Says Y Combinator Won’t Cut Ties with Peter Thiel over Trump Donation Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER 2016 Election Sam Altman Says Y Combinator Won’t Cut Ties with Peter Thiel over Trump Donation Thiel’s million-dollar donation raises questions about how Silicon Valley is dealing with the ultimate form of disruption: supporting Donald Trump. by Maya KosoffOctober 17, 2016 1:47 pm Email Facebook Twitter From Bloomberg/Getty Images. Even for an industry known for taking big bets, Peter Thiel’s latest investment is audacious—and more than a little perplexing. In the wake of one of the worst weeks of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign—which began with a leaked video of the candidate speaking lewdly about women and culminated with a dozen women accusing him of sexual assault or harassment—Thiel, an avowed Trump supporter, committed $1.25 million to the fellow billionaire’s campaign. Though there was some speculation about whether he would continue to support Trump, Thiel now appears to be doubling down. Thiel, who is a Facebook board member and a part-time partner at start-up accelerator Y Combinator, is known as a contrarian, even by Silicon Valley standards. While most of the industry alternates between liberal and libertarian leanings, Thiel is an outlier. He believes that monopolies are good, and that college is bad. He’s lamented women’s suffrage for having “rendered the notion of ‘capitalist democracy’ into an oxymoron.” But his support for Trump has been the most galling, prompting plenty of soul-searching in the Bay Area about the tech world’s commitment to free speech. Y Combinator boss Sam Altman addressed the controversy head-on in a series of tweets Sunday, making it clear that while he think Trump is “unfit to be President,” Y Combinator—which has helped lead to the creation of valuable tech start-ups like Airbnb—will continue to stick with Thiel. “YC is not going to fire someone for supporting a major party nominee,” he wrote. “That’s a dangerous road to start down.” Altman seemed to echo the sentiments of Y Combinator founder Paul Graham, who last week tweeted a paltry defense of Thiel. “Peter is eccentric, but earnest. He seems to have a blind spot about Trump’s character, but he is no surrogate,” he said. “Do you mean YC should cut ties to Peter because of his political views? It seems to me that’s the sort of thing we’re fighting against.” https://twitter.com/sama/status/787834522180079616 Though Altman and Graham aren’t distancing themselves from Thiel, others in the community have labeled the PayPal co-founder persona non grata. “You’re hearing ‘disgusting’ when I’m saying ‘existential threat,’ ” tweeted Erica Baker, a Slack engineer who has been outspoken about the need for diversity in tech. “I’m not just disgusted, I’m scared for the lives of me and mine.” The broader pushback from the tech industry against Trump has been overwhelming, with a number of high-profile members of the tech elite throwing their support behind Democrats like Clinton, though it has not been universal. Twenty-four-year-old virtual-reality wunderkind Palmer Luckey faced swift backlash last month from the virtual-reality development community for outing himself as a donor for the anti-Hillary Clinton group Nimble America, a super-PAC “focused on promoting the ideals of America First, Smart Trade, Legal Immigration, and Ethical Behavior,” the group’s now-defunct Facebook page once read. Luckey almost immediately issued an apology: “I am deeply sorry that my actions are negatively impacting the perception of Oculus and its partners,” he wrote. “The recent news stories about me do not accurately represent my views.” For an industry that idolizes disruption, voting for Trump may be one form of dissent that remains taboo. The Valley’s business-friendly politics, particularly on immigration, is a far cry from Trump’s heterodox economic and cultural worldview, leading even longtime Republicans like Hewlett-Packard’s Meg Whitman to denounce him. Trump is said to have raised just $300,000 from the tech industry outside of Thiel’s donation. Other Republicans in tech have been even more wary of throwing support behind Trump. Intel C.E.O. Brian Krzanich canceled a fund-raiser he planned to host for Trump earlier this year after the event was reported on by The New York Times, and now Krzanich says he plans not to endorse either presidential candidate. Trump also hasn’t done much outreach to the tech community. While Clinton laid out a veritable love letter of a tech policy plan, filled with promises of investments in high-speed Internet and computer-science education, Trump has done no such thing, instead choosing to focus on attacking some of the biggest companies in the industry. He called for a boycott of Apple products earlier this year in light of the company’s public battle with the F.B.I., and his surrogates have attacked Mark Zuckerberg after the Facebook C.E.O. criticized the candidate’s plan to build a wall between the United States and Mexico.

Comment Comment Rohan Silva: Tech City’s go-getting example can help post-Brexit Britain Rohan Silva Monday 17 October 2016 09:17 BST Rohan Silva: 'It’s not easy to win new investment but if you work hard enough, anything is possible' Nigel Howard / Evening Standard I feel old. Exactly six years ago this month, I was on a trade mission to Silicon Valley, trying to convince US tech giants to invest in east London. I’d organised the trip ahead of the launch of the Tech City initiative, which I’d hoped would turbocharge the growth of the small digital cluster around Old Street. The stakes were high: we needed to secure global investment or the project would be dead on arrival. The entrepreneurial minister Jeremy Hunt and the former head of the Olympic Park legacy corporation, Andy Altman, also made the journey, and our days were packed with visits to sceptical tech bigwigs who had zero interest in the UK, and no idea there were so many brilliant companies being started in the capital. It was a tough slog, and things were looking grim when we arrived at Google’s sprawling HQ. It was our last meeting before heading home, and we were seeing Eric Schmidt, the company’s powerful CEO, so we had to make it count.  As soon as we walked in, we began selling Tech City hard, fighting to persuade Eric that Google should invest there. He didn’t know anything about the area, so instinctively rejected the idea, saying: “We don’t put our people in a business park in the middle of nowhere.” Eric was clearly sick of government delegations pitching projects in remote parts of far-flung countries.  Fortunately that wasn’t the case with us. We described east London’s art galleries, bars and music venues, and Eric started to be won over. He looked at Andy Altman and said: “You’re in charge of the Olympic Park. How much would it cost us to buy the entire thing?” The poor Google staffers looked nervous — was their boss being serious? Luckily for them, Andy had no way to answer the question, so the conversation moved on, and we’ll never know for sure.  Read more Rohan Silva: How to make it easier to be an entrepreneur and a parent In the end, we shook hands on a commitment that Google would create an “innovation centre” in Tech City, which David Cameron announced just a few weeks later. This is how the Google Campus in Bonhill Street came into being: a five-storey building that hosts start-up events every day and provides cheap workspace, mentoring and funding for small businesses.  This investment was hugely important for Tech City and the London economy. For a start, it created a generous community space for techies to come together, sparking valuable new collaborations and businesses, and catalysing the development of our city’s digital ecosystem. Policy-makers often overlook the importance of physical hubs where innovation happens, and it’s vital that the Government’s new industrial strategy doesn’t make that mistake. What’s more, other global companies soon followed suit, and Amazon, Microsoft, Intel, Cisco and many others committed to investing millions in east London, helping make Tech City the fastest-growing digital cluster in the world.  These memories came flooding back to me this weekend when Theresa May announced new trade missions to boost international links after the Brexit vote. As our Silicon Valley trip showed, it’s not easy to win new investment but if you work hard enough, anything is possible. And once the floodgates open, a trickle can quickly become a tsunami. If Britain is going to flourish outside the EU, that’s exactly what we’re going to need.

IAM Magazine Login Reset password Toggle navigation Home Home Magazine Blog Market intelligence Top patent professionals Top IP strategists International reports Events Media IPBC Meizu warns of “crisis” for Chinese industry as Qualcomm files new patent complaints in US and Europe 17 Oct 16 < Back to Blogs Jacob Schindler Qualcomm on Saturday announced that it has expanded its assertion campaign against Meizu, the largest Chinese smartphone maker yet to conclude a licence agreement with the US chipmaker since its 2015 settlement with Chinese regulators. The move should definitively put to rest rumours that had swirled in Chinese-language media suggesting that the two sides had reached a settlement that would soon be made public. In a public response, Meizu took the opportunity to portray itself as defending the entire Chinese mobile industry against a looming “crisis” for its business model, an indication that the court of public opinion in China will also be an important venue in this dispute. The San Diego company said in a press release that it has filed a patent infringement case in Germany’s Mannheim Regional Court, as well as an “infringement-seizure action” in France that could lead to the collection of evidence for a possible future lawsuit there. Meizu remains largely China-oriented, but Europe represents its biggest current effort to expand into developed markets. According to the company’s website, it has twelve distribution partners for online sales in France, with others in Italy, Russia, Spain and the UK. An additional complaint to the US International Trade Commision comes despite the fact the Meizu is not directly selling handsets into the US market yet, though executives have talked it up as the next step after entering Europe. Qualcomm first took Meizu to court in June, claiming that the company had “refused to engage in good faith negotiations […] choosing instead to engage only in delay tactics”. Qualcomm first asked the Beijing IP court to rule that the licensing terms on offer were consistent with China’s Anti-Monopoly Law, and subsequently filed 17 different infringement actions around the country. The case is the first in China to test how the country’s courts, including new specialist IP benches in both Beijing and Shanghai, will interpret the latest rulings made by Chinese regulators on key SEP and FRAND issues affecting the entire industry. Speaking to this blog in June, Qualcomm’s former Asia patents director predicted that Meizu would settle the case, if not before trial then before the appellate stage. Last month there was a round of speculation in Chinese-language media suggesting that the two companies might be preparing to announce a settlement in early October. A Meizu rep told IAM at the time that there was no truth to the rumours, and the latest round of lawsuits seems to confirm that there remains a significant distance between the sides if negotiations are going on at all. Meizu released a Chinese-language statement in response to the fresh suits, re-iterating that it is willing to pay a licence fee to Qualcomm, but that it doesn’t view the offers put forth as reasonable. The company also sought to cast the dispute as one in which it is representing the interest of the entire industry in China, saying: “If Qualcomm has its way […] China’s entire mobile phone industry will be faced with crisis.” The Chinese company warned that billions of dollars in patent costs would be transferred to consumers if Qualcomm’s model goes unchallenged, and the development of China’s “national enterprises” would unfairly take a hit. It goes without saying that Qualcomm does not want its dispute with Meizu cast as one that pits it against the whole Chinese mobile industry and other “national enterprises”. But given that Meizu appears to be the lone holdout among major Chinese phone makers, it may be difficult for it to make that case stick – especially if other local companies take the view that Meizu is the one gaining an advantage by not paying, for the time being, a cost that the rest of the industry is. Another point of interest in the Meizu statement is that it cites the 2014 study by WilmerHale and Intel estimating the royalty stack on the average smartphone could account for up to one third of each phone’s cost. Meizu specifically pointed to the authors’ estimate that on an average $400 phone, the cost of patent licences could be up to $120. But as this blog recently reported, a paper released this year calculated the annual licensing return from mobile devices at just $14 billion – around 3% of the market’s total value. Whichever dataset is closer to the truth, it’s a reminder that the ongoing debate around patent reform has effects far beyond the US. The court proceedings in this case will be important, but so too will the efforts of both sides to shape public opinion in China, which are no doubt just getting started. Sectors Licensing IP litigation Patents Comments RE: Meizu warns of “crisis” for Chinese industry as Qualcomm files new patent complaints in US and Europe Meizu crying that the sky is falling will not change the fact that it will lose this battle. The Chinese antitrust authorities spent two years investigating Qualcomm and crafting a fair settlement. Meizu is attempting to flout the very system that gave it and and other Chinese smartphone makers a huge discount.

Peter Thiel donating $US1.25 million to Trump Chris Keall Sunday October 16, 2016 7 Share Peter Thiel Play NBR radio on Tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel is donating $US1.25 million to Donald Trump, according to the New York Times (the Republican nominee needs it. According to the Times, he raised $US75 million in October to the Clinton campaign's $US150 million). Mr Thiel — a founding investor in PayPal, the first outsider to put money into Facebook and a current major shareholder in Xero — raised eyebrows when he put his hand up to be a Trump delegate for California at the July Republican convention. The move put the billionaire in the lonely position of being the only major Silicon Valley figure to support the decisive Republican nominee. Calls by Mr Trump for Apple to hand over its encryption keys to the state, and bring low-skilled, low-margin hardware assembly jobs back to the US have many in the tech sector up in arms. But true to his contrarian form, Mr Thiel is doubling down rather than backing after the most recent Trump controversies (the latest being the New Yorker's insane call for drug-testing before the third debate). So how did the openly gay Mr Thiel come to join Camp Trump, home of so much intolerant rhetoric and hate-chants at its rallies? According to the Guardian, the entrepreneur is "very hawkish on immigration" and has previously donated $US1 million to Numbers USA, a group that lobbies for reduced intake. It has been noted that there's some irony in Mr Trump lobbying for restrictions on immigration, given he is the grandson of an immigrant (albeit of course, not a black or Latino one). The same could be said of Mr Thiel only more so, given he was born in West Germany, making him the latest in a long list of immigrants who have contributed to US domination of the tech industry that includes Andy Grove (Intel), Elon Musk (PayPal, Tesla, SpaceX) and Sergey Brin (Google), among many others. And that's not to mention the children of immigrants such as the Syrian Abdul Jandali, who foisted the layabout Steve Jobs on the Californian education system. At a speech during the July Republican convention, Mr Thiel struck something of a first, telling the audience he was proud to be gay, but elsewhere covered the familiar populist territory mined by everyone from Bernie Sanders to Mr Trump this electoral cycle, saying "Across the country, wages are flat. Americans get paid less today than 10 years ago. But health care and college tuition cost more every year. Meanwhile, Wall Street bankers inflate bubbles in everything from government bonds to Hillary Clinton’s speaking fees. Our economy is broken. If you’re watching me right now, you understand this better than any politician in Washington DC.” Outside of politics, Mr Thiel has also caused controversy (and perhaps set Mr Trump's heart a flutter) by bankrolling a lawsuit that forced media site Gawker out of business.  Read more from Chris Keall Email Chris: ckeall@nbr.co.nz Follow @@ChrisKeall 7 · Got a question about this story?

Who'd a thought I'd ever be linking to John Pilger. Although he's deluded in his collectivist ends, he's made it to a solid half-way on causes.

Quote: 'A generation ago, a post-modern cult now known as “identity politics” stopped many intelligent, liberal-minded people examining the causes and individuals they supported – such as the fakery of Obama and Clinton...' Great read. Reply Share Share   2 0 by Hip hop 1 month ago in reply to Mark Hubbard  Mark Hubbard - you are a nutter living in the the echo chamber that is far right wing media. Try getting up, walking away from your computer and go outside in the sun. Reply Share Share   0 1 #3 by me 1 month ago The States is screwed with two very poor choices for President. One an egotistical nutter and the other a corrupt puppet master for billionaires Reply Share Share   1 0 by Chin Dynasty 1 month ago in reply to me You mean billionaires like Warren Buffett who donates billions of dollars to charity? How shocking! Much better that a presidential candidate be controlled by the social welfare beneficiaries? Reply Share Share   0 2 #4 by Anonymous 30 days ago I just think anyone who can poll over 40% in the US deserves our respect. If only because one day they might be entitled to demand it. If a couple of golf games can improve relations then you better believe smarmy remarks off the course can dampen them. If you want to promote sunflower politics you better be breeding an all season variety. The alternative is to grow tall poppys but they only flourish in the US.
