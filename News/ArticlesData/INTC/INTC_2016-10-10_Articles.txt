It’ll do that with its new Intel Falcon 8+ drone system, which is getting its official unveiling today at the 2016 INTERGEO drone conference in Hamburg. The Intel Falcon 8+ is something of a next-generation follow up to the AscTec Falcon 8. Meant for a range of commercial applications including industrial inspection, surveying, and mapping, the Falcon 8+ drone offers full electronic system redundancy, along with what Intel and AscTec are calling “best-in-class sensors.” When those sensors are combined with the waypoint automation systems present on the Falcon 8+, Intel says the drone is capable of providing “detailed images down to millimeter accuracy, offering valuable structural analysis that detects and prevents damage to infrastructure.” However, the Falcon 8+ is only one part of the overall package here, as the drone also comes with Intel’s Cockpit controller. Water resistant and – judging by the images Intel is sharing of this thing – seemingly built to take some abuse, the Cockpit pairs with an Intel-based tablet to give drone operators an easy way to plan, execute, and monitor flights, capable of live streaming in up to 1080p. Finally, the Falcon 8+ ships with the Intel Powerpack, which comes equipped with a storage mode, automatic balancing, and a set of LED lights to indicate battery charge. Unfortunately, Intel didn’t share details on how long users can expect the Powerpack to last while it’s powering the Falcon 8+. The Falcon 8+ drone system will be launching next month, but Intel has yet to announce any kind of pricing information for the package. Considering what’s included in the system and the fact that Intel is explicitly targeting commercial applications with this release, though, it probably isn’t a good idea to expect the Falcon 8+ to come in on the lower end of the pricing spectrum.

Comments By Agam Shah Follow IDG News Service | Oct 11, 2016 10:48 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Data Storage Servers Data Center Enterprise Applications Computer Processors Comments After years of being offered as separate technologies, storage and memory are beginning to merge. It's already happening, for example, with 3D Xpoint, a technology from Intel and Micron that can serve as memory, storage, or both. Now, a new consortium, called Gen-Z, is out to ease the transition to this new class of storage and memory in computers. It's creating a new specification and architecture that will make it easier to add new forms of non-volatile memory to computers. Gen-Z will have a new connector, fabric and data transfer protocol. One goal is to create an open standard so new forms of memory can communicate with processors and accelerators in a coherent manner. Gen-Z will also work with SSDs like QuantX from Micron. Data transfer speeds for the new specification will be tens to hundreds of gigabytes per second, much faster than the speed of the upcoming PCI-Express 4.0, which offers 32GBps. Gen-Z's data-transfer speed will be finalized by the time the specification is released at the end of this year. The new architecture will be targeted at servers and data centers first; it's not certain whether it will come to PCs. Usually, server technologies ultimately trickle down to PCs. Gen-Z consortium members include top server companies IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Dell and Lenovo, and storage and memory vendors Samsung, Seagate, Micron, Western Digital and SK Hynix. Sitting out of the consortium is Intel, which hasn't always played well with other hardware makers on industry standards. The chip maker has nothing to lose by joining the open organization, but seemingly wants to protect its own server technologies. The Gen-Z architecture and technology can be used both outside and inside the server, said Robert Hormuth, chief technology officer for servers at Dell EMC. At its highest speed, Gen-Z could be connected as a point-to-point bus in a server enclosure. It could also be used to connect servers, storage and memory arrays in a rack, Hormuth said. In a way, Gen-Z is designed for the data centers of the future, where memory, storage and processors will be pooled in separate boxes. Today, servers come with storage, memory and processing in one box, and that's a limitation. It will be possible to decouple them into separate boxes with Gen-Z as a connector. Larger pools of storage, memory and processing can be dedicated to each discrete box. That will help applications like SAP HANA, which relies on in-memory processing. New forms of DRAM and flash storage replacements like MRAM (magnetoresistive RAM), RRAM (resistive RAM) and PCM (phase change memory) are under development, and Gen-Z will make it easier to add those technologies to servers.  But memory experts expect DRAM to last for up to a decade, and DDR5 is already under development. But Gen-Z faces challenges. Intel accounts for more than 90 percent of server chip shipments today, and could block the adoption of Gen-Z. Consortium members like ARM and IBM are trying to break that dominance, but have failed. If the specification does gain adoption, however, it could play a role in breaking Intel's server dominance. Gen-Z said all hardware makers are welcome, and it wouldn't cost Intel anything to join. Intel declined to answer questions on why it wasn't joining Gen-Z. "We have offered high-performance coherent interconnects and industry standard memory, I/O, and accelerator interfaces on our CPUs for decades. This provides our customers with the best combination of choice, performance, and total cost of ownership," an Intel spokesman said in an email. The industry-standard technologies Intel is referring to are now aging and being replaced by faster I/O, memory and storage technologies. But considering that Intel dominates servers, it is also driving technology adoption. Intel is also releasing new storage, memory and I/O technologies for servers, which are all proprietary. Gen-Z is an open specification, and will be compatible with 3D Xpoint, which will form the basis for Intel's upcoming Optane storage and memory products. But Intel is trying to protect its own OmniPath technology, a proprietary architecture and interconnect, which Gen-Z will compete against. Intel is also pushing silicon photonics in order to wire up servers in data centers. Aside from Intel, all major server, storage and memory makers are banding together to make Gen-Z work. A lack of cooperation between Intel and server makers like Dell and HPE on Gen-Z could create a stalemate of technology adoption in servers and the computing industry at large.

Co. Ltd. How this chip giant is adopting a strategy that has worked very well for a fellow chip maker. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 11, 2016 at 8:21AM Image source: Intel.  Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and contract chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) are the two largest manufacturers of logic semiconductors (in other words, chips that aren't memory) in the world. Intel's business model has traditionally been to focus on designing, manufacturing, and selling its own products (mainly high-performance processors for personal computer and data center applications) on the most advanced technologies available to it. TSMC, on the other hand, manufactures all kinds of chips for an extremely wide variety of customers and applications across a range of manufacturing technologies -- from cutting edge to technologies that first went into production more than a decade ago.  Both business models have been wildly successful, and as of writing, both TSMC and Intel sport very similar market capitalizations ($155 billion for TSMC, $182 billion for Intel). That being said, there is one way Intel appears to be trying to mimic TSMC. Some background on Intel's prior strategy Historically, Intel's game plan with respect to chip manufacturing technology has been to develop a new manufacturing technology and then move the bulk of its shipment volumes to that new technology as quickly as possible. The idea behind this strategy is actually quite simple. Intel says each successive manufacturing technology generation delivers a lower cost per transistor (a chip is made up of hundreds of millions, if not billions, of transistors), so it makes sense from an economic perspective to do this. Additionally, newer manufacturing technologies offer better performance/power characteristics, which helps make products more appealing. Despite all of this, based on both disclosures from Intel as well as leaks surrounding Intel's future products, it would appear that the company no longer intends to pursue the strategy of "moving as much volume over to the newest manufacturing technology as quickly as possible." How Intel is changing gears -- and why During the first half of 2018, I expect Intel's product line to look something like this: Category Product Name Manufacturing Tech. Low-cost PC Gemini Lake 14-nanometer Ultrabook/2-in-1 PC Cannon Lake 10-nanometer High-performance notebook Coffee Lake 14-nanometer Mainstream desktop Coffee Lake 14-nanometer High-end desktop Skylake-X 14-nanometer Server/data center Skylake-EN/EP/EX 14-nanometer Data source: BenchLife.info. Note that Intel will have only transitioned one product line (albeit a high-volume one) to its 10-nanometer technology; the rest of the company's product stack will be manufactured in some variant of the company's 14-nanometer technology, which first went into mass production in the second half of 2014. I don't expect Intel will transition the bulk of its microprocessor volume to 10-nanometer until the first half of 2019. Then, after that, I would expect Intel to repeat that strategy by transitioning its ultra-low-power products to 7-nanometers while keeping the bulk of its processor shipments on some variant of its 10-nanometer manufacturing technology. Why is Intel doing this? I believe the answer lies in the fact that Intel's claims of lower cost per transistor are normalized for manufacturing yields. That is, those cost-per-transistor figures assume a similar level of technological maturity between the newer manufacturing technology and the older-generation technology. However, the reality is that Intel seems to be facing increasing difficulties in ramping its latest manufacturing technologies up at high yield rates. For some product segments (e.g., anything in which battery life is critical), Intel really needs the power-saving benefits of newer manufacturing technologies, so the company has little choice but to transition to those new technologies, regardless of yields. However, some products aren't as power-sensitive (e.g., desktops), so Intel can afford to do what it's doing with its upcoming Coffee Lake part and simply implement a newer architecture in a more mature manufacturing technology. This has the effect of keeping a large portion of its chip shipments on a more cost-effective technology, which helps to balance out the negative margin impact from transitioning some of its products to newer manufacturing technologies. Moreover, with a large base of revenue coming from "mature" technologies, Intel can more quickly advance key performance/power-sensitive product lines to next-generation manufacturing technologies while minimizing the impact of those products to overall gross profit margins. This is exactly how TSMC does it One of the reasons TSMC has been able to so quickly transition to newer manufacturing technologies is precisely the fact that it has so much highly profitable business on older manufacturing technologies to pick up the slack, as one can see below: Image source: TSMC. Even today, less than a quarter of TSMC's revenue comes from shipments of chips on its 16-nanometer and 20-nanometer technologies combined. This means even if TSMC is taking it on the chin with respect to the margins on those technologies (and TSMC has indicated that it takes a while for its latest technologies to achieve margins in line with the corporate average), the remaining 77% of its revenue can more than buoy overall gross profit margins. The investment takeaway At the end of the day, Intel's job is to build best-in-class products so that it can keep its average selling prices and market share in key product segments as high as possible. In some of its product segments, rapid adoption of newer manufacturing technology isn't imperative, but in others, it's absolutely critical. By being more selective about the manufacturing technology on which it builds each of its products, Intel can improve its competitive positioning across the board, ultimately helping it maximize its revenue and profitability.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 11, 2016 at 8:21AM Image source: Intel.  Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and contract chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) are the two largest manufacturers of logic semiconductors (in other words, chips that aren't memory) in the world.

The prices below include VAT. PRICE £699 ($799) £1,679 ($1,949) £1,789 ($2,179) You've got to hand it to Alienware. Despite bearing the brunt of l33t gamer criticism since the Dell buyout in 2006—after all, Alienware machines have tended to resemble something from 12-year-old's high school sketch book—the company has ploughed on, creating increasingly sleek laptops and desktops. Its latest, the squat, mid-size tower dubbed Aurora, is the most desirable Alienware machine yet. Taking cues from the company's gargantuan Area 51, the Aurora sports a surprisingly compact form factor, restrained (for Alienware at least) aesthetics, and a price that's not far off a self-build. It even has decent cooling performance. For the first time in a long time, if a tech-shy relative or PC gaming newbie asks whether or not an Alienware desktop is worth it, you can finally say yes. Standing 472.52mm (18.6 inches) tall, a mere 360.5mm (14.19 inches) deep, and 212mm (8.35 inches) wide, the Alienware Aurora is smaller and wider than your average gaming desktop. Which, given the move towards smaller systems that are just at home in the living room as they are in an office or bedroom, is no bad thing. Indeed, this is probably the first Alienware you could place in a living room, in full view, and not receive cold, hard shame from a loved one. That's partly thanks to the Aurora's flat front panel, which is finished in a sturdy matte black plastic up top, with a non-threatening piano black grille underneath. Older models were somehow both curvier and more angular all at once, which led to some questionable aesthetics. That said, there's still a light-up, RGB LED alien-head power switch, but you can turn it off if you prefer a more subdued look. The Aurora has a unique look that quickly grows on you. [That's the Ars UK office, incidentally -Ed.] The Aurora has a unique look that quickly grows on you. [That's the Ars UK office, incidentally -Ed.] The Alienware head power switch is illuminated, but the lighting can be turned off. On the front panel are four USB sockets, and headphone and microphone jacks. The Aurora's feet. The other side of the Aurora has vents for the graphics card. The Aurora's rear IO, including a lot of USB sockets. The sleeker styling continues with the side panels, which feature a soft grey finish, and the same tri-LED light bars that appear across the Alienware range. The panels aren't flat, and actually arch out from the front panel somewhere, but they look good, neatly avoiding the bulging effect that many PC cases with a similar design suffer from. The left panel also features air intake vents for the graphics card(s) inside. The top of the Aurora features the same glossy grille as the front, as well as a 120mm exhaust fan. If you opt for the all-in-one liquid cooling solution, the radiator mounts here alongside the fan. The asymmetrical top panel also houses a useful carry handle, which makes lugging the Aurora around to LAN parties (they're still a thing, right?) much easier. And at an average weight of 14kg (32lbs), depending on the configuration, it's just about possible to lift it with one hand too. Unfortunately, the reasonable weight comes at the expense of build materials: the entirety of the Aurora's external case is made of plastic. It's a good, solid, quality plastic, but when so many other high-end desktops are being built with premium materials like aluminium and glass, the plastic is a letdown. Indeed, when removed, the side panels make that horrible hollow, rattling sound so reminiscent of pre-built PCs from the '90s. Yes, it's upgradable At least the side panels are easy to remove. While the Aurora might be an off-the-shelf gaming PC, Alienware has made it easy to get inside. On the rear of the case is a plastic handle that, when pulled, ejects the vented side panel revealing a tightly packed interior and a unique layout. Where most PCs have a top- or bottom-mounted power supply, the Aurora saves space by situating the power supply above the motherboard. Just next to the side-panel lever are two sliding switches that unlock the PSU, allowing it to swing up and out from the case, cables still attached. This gives you unfettered access to the CPU-cooler and socket, memory slots (there are four, with two populated by default), and PCIe slots. There's room for two full-length graphics cards, although using two means giving up access to one of the smaller 4X slots. There's an M.2 slot for PCIe-based NVMe storage like a Samsung 960 Pro, two 2.5-inch tool-free sleds for standard SSDs, and a single 3.5-inch hard drive slot, which sits just under the PSU. These should provide enough storage options for most users, though it isn't a great setup for anyone looking to store vast amounts of data. Pull this lever and the side panel pops off. Pull this lever and the side panel pops off. The power supply is uniquely mounted above the motherboard. It sits on a hinge that flips out, giving you access to all the internals. With the graphics card out you can access the M.2 slot and SATA sockets. The RAM, GPU, and M.2 SSD removed. The flip-out PSU in all its glory. Another look inside. This particular system came with an all-in-one liquid cooling system. The SSD and RAM that the Aurora uses. The one thing you can't do is replace the motherboard. It's standard proprietary Dell fare—although it does appear close to mATX size—with little in the way of easy access. Cable management is good though, with cables neatly tied into position along the sides of the bare steel case. This particular configuration comes with a modular 850W power supply, but Alienware pre-wires any extra cables you might need into their relevant positions. There are spare SATA power connectors near the 2.5-inch bays, for example, and there's an extra PCIe power connector, should you wish to add another graphics card. With such a unique configuration, you might be wondering how the Aurora handles airflow. The good news is that despite the location of the PSU, I didn't experience any throttling problems. The 120mm fan at the front pulls in cool air, with the top-mounted radiator and fan exhausting air out of the case. Meanwhile, the (blower-style) graphics card sucks in cool air from the grilles on the side panel. There isn't a removable fan filter on the grille, which means you've got to lug the whole side panel around in order to clear out any dust. I also wonder how well the Aurora would do with an air cooler (as is featured in certain configs) instead of the all-in-one. I suspect overclocking would be out of the question.

The chip is significant as "the industry’s first 14nm FPGA," but not only that - it is based upon a quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 processor with integrated HBM2 in-package, using Intel HyperFlex architecture. At IDF16, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich described the Stratix 10 as "a beast," in reference to its performance and density. It is boldly claimed that the Stratix 10 "will revolutionize the performance of data centres and networking infrastructures". The new FPGA is expected to enable service providers, data centres, cloud computing and storage systems "to satisfy their insatiable demand for higher computational capabilities, lower latency, greater system flexibility and increased power efficiencies". Intel broke down the advances and appeal of the new Stratix 10 into handy bullet-point chunks as follows: 2X the core performance and over 5X the density compared to the previous generation. Up to 70 per cent lower power than Stratix V FPGAs for equivalent performance. Up to 10TFLOPS of single-precision floating point DSP performance. Up to 1TBps memory bandwidth with integrated High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM2) in-package. Embedded quad-core 64-bit ARM Cortex-A53 processor. FPGAs could be of particular utility value in the data centre, thinks Intel. Their ability to be "reconfigured in milliseconds to accelerate individual tasks," can provide significant improvements in performance and power efficiency over new and changing workloads. In bandwidth-intensive applications, such as delivering triple-play traffic, Stratix 10 FPGAs can enable an efficient, bandwidth-rich infrastructure. For further detailed information on the Stratix 10 you can download the white paper (PDF), and/or watch the Introducing Stratix 10 FPGAs and SoCs, and the Stratix 10 Architecture videos.

Many people are taking notice of this new wave of innovation – and the impact it could have at both a consumer and corporate level. Even Her Royal Highness has addressed the matter, introducing changes which enable driverless cars to be insured under ordinary policies in the Queen’s speech earlier this year. The UK government has also demonstrated the country’s commitment to furthering the development of the driverless car economy. This summer, a major consultation was launched to support automated vehicle technologies and smooth the path towards automated cars being used successfully on British roads. >See also: The government and automotive industry must not risk neglecting the security essentials in their push for innovation The government and automotive industry must not risk neglecting the security essentials in their push for innovation. Doing so could risk not only the success of these new technologies, but also user safety. Intel Security has reported that connected cars are the third fastest-growing technological device after tablets and phones. While the regulatory changes and consultations implemented thus far demonstrate a level of forward thinking that could deliver a huge boost to the UK economy, security must also be considered. As new technology is adopted, cybercriminals constantly attempt to identify new methods to exploit any potential vulnerabilities for financial gain. With the world’s connectivity continuing to grow, the threat landscape continues to expand. Through live demos, Intel Security has proven that it is possible for ransomware attackers to reach their victims through vulnerabilities in auto-entertainment systems in modern vehicles, leaving the driver unable to operate their car unless they pay a ransom. Late last year, Intel began developing the Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) in conjunction with founding members Aeris and Uber. Forming a collaboration of the top security and automotive industry talent worldwide, the board aims to keep one step ahead of cybercriminals and secure potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. While innovation around internet connectivity in vehicles has enabled the addition of exciting new features, including real-time telematics, smart intersections and autonomous driving, it does open up a new avenue to lucrative hacks for cybercriminals. Built-in security solutions must be factored in from the start to ensure that next-generation cars can operate safely at their full potential, even within a potentially malicious operating environment. Security by design The consolidation and interconnection of vehicle systems requires an intentional, proactive security design. As a result, vehicle security needs to begin at the very start – in the design phase. Foundational principles taken from related industries, such as defence and aerospace, can be utilised. These include designing secure systems from hardware to the cloud with identified best practices and technologies for each particular building block and defence-in-depth, a process similar to the layers of protection analysis (LOPA) methodology used for safety and risk reduction. Security by design should also consider areas such as secure boot, trusted execution environments, message authentication, tamper protection, isolation of safety critical systems, network encryption, data privacy, behavioural monitoring, anomaly detection, and shared threat intelligence. Automotive security must not just start with design, but should move through to the production and operation stages. By implementing best practices throughout production processes, design components can be correctly incorporated and linked back to the properties outlined in the secure design. This can offer customers confidence in the security of the platform. Key best practices here include code reviews, continuous validation of security assumptions, component and system-level penetration tests, inbound and outbound materials processes, maintenance and upgrade plans, and a feedback loop for continuous learning and improvement. Secure transport Threat analysis and risk assessment must continue once cars are on the road. Old vulnerabilities can be patched and new ones can appear – the risk of an attack can even increase over time. Both consumers and manufacturers can feel confident if detailed incident response plans are in place in case a newly discovered vulnerability or security breach arises. Using techniques such as over-the-air software or firmware patches and upgrades enables manufacturers to quickly remove vulnerabilities and significantly reduce recall costs. In addition, threat intelligence aids the identification and understanding of potential criminal business models, enabling businesses to prioritise threats and their associated risks while implementing an appropriate incident response. The success of these operational measures requires secure chains of trust to be built into the vehicle, designed to last throughout its lifetime. >See also: The future of driverless cars and data security Automotive security best practices today are a combination of product safety and computer security. . In addition to ensuring cyber attacks are difficult to execute, preventive and mitigation techniques must be in place to detect and correct vulnerabilities quickly before too much damage is done. Ultimately, the Automotive Security Review Board aims to help create an environment in which cars can self-heal – detecting malicious intent, withstanding attacks and performing self-repair where necessary. With increased collaboration between the automotive industry, standards organisations and security experts, this vision can become a reality.   Sourced from Raj Samani, CTO EMEA, Intel Security Related Topics connected cars Security Comments (0) Leave a Reply Cancel replyLogin to comment Prev Next Read More Latest Popular Teenager admits hacking TalkTalk Ignorance is not bliss when your data has been hacked or stolen Why objective testing is critical to the super-fast 5G future The future of smart power in the smart city Work from anywhere with cloud document management The path to manageable data Wine cellar, swimming pool and a treehouse: Inside Zoopla’s new office The smart nation: Singapore’s masterplan Turning big data into high-class insights Rolling into the digital age: inside Rolls-Royce’s tech transformation Products Information Age Magazine Since its launch in 1995, Information Age has been regarded as one of the most respected technology titles in the B2B realm.

Lenovo knows a thing or two about building great business laptops, and the ThinkPad X1 Yoga is no exception. Fusing Intel’s Skylake processors with a 14in WQHD display, this hybrid is designed to flit between laptop and tablet modes with ease – and with a dash of style to boot. Not that the ThinkPad X1 Yoga draws attention to itself. Encased in sheets of matte-black carbon fiber, bar the small pinprick of red afloat in the centre of the keyboard – yes, there’s still a TrackPoint, this is a ThinkPad after all – the X1 Yoga is relentlessly monochromatic. There’s still something reassuringly utilitarian in its simplicity. And crucially for a 14in laptop, it’s thin and light. Weighing 1.27kg and measuring a slender 16.8mm thick, it’s lighter than many 13.3in laptops. What’s more, it’s MIL-SPEC rated for toughness. The combination of carbon fiber and a metal skeleton make for a business laptop that’s ready to handle considerable punishment. Hybrid trickery By far the X1 Yoga’s greatest talent is that its hybrid trickery doesn’t come at the expense of usability. Unlike the Microsoft Surface Pro 4, say, it’s a great laptop that just happens to turn into a king-sized tablet. Yes, it’s heavy by tablet standards, but even here it has several advantages over some of its peers, not least that the stylus docks invisibly into the X1 Yoga’s right-hand side. When there, it silently charges, but if you happen to exhaust its battery then Lenovo claims a 15-second charge will provide up to 1hr 40mins of use. In truth, it’s hard to find anything to moan about. The backlit keyboard offers the usual ThinkPad quality and, as the X1 Yoga has a 14in chassis, it’s every bit as spacious and comfortable to type on as a desktop keyboard. Personally, I’d still rather have a touchpad with discrete buttons, but Lenovo’s buttonless touchpad is reliable, and you can always resort to the touchpoint if you prefer. The ThinkPad X1 Yoga is more than a superb laptop, though. Tilt back the screen and the solid yet flexible hinge allows you to fold it through 360 degrees and use it in stand, tent or tablet modes.  In tablet mode, the X1 Yoga is in its element. Pull the small stylus out of the right-hand edge, and the matte finish across the display gives a lovely feel to everything from writing to sketching or annotating documents. It’s the most responsive tablet I’ve ever used – and that includes the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 – with the Wacom active digitiser and pen technology providing a perfect blend of sensitivity and accuracy. OLED surprise The most unusual twist in the X1 Yoga’s specifications is perhaps the one you’d least expect in a business laptop: that 14in touchscreen also comes in an optional OLED version. Our review unit had the standard IPS touchscreen, but if the OLED panel is up to these standards then expect pure brilliance. The 2,560 x 1,440 panel is so crisp and vivid that I briefly wondered if I was looking at a fake laptop. Desktop icons are suspended on an inky black and colours look gorgeously vibrant. For a while, I wondered if I actually had the OLED model in front of me. Run through the numbers and there’s little to complain about. The panel covers 96.9% of the sRGB colour space, hits a maximum brightness of 296cd/m2, and has a solid – if not class-leading – contrast ratio of 916:1. The clincher here, however, is colour accuracy; not only has Lenovo ensured that the X1 Yoga reproduces almost all the colours you could want, it also delivers the correct shades. An average Delta E of 1.37 is good by any standards, and the maximum deviation of 3.55 isn’t bad at all. The only shortfall is the panel’s inability to delve down into the most intense blues, which is barely noticeable.  Here is a business laptop that’s equally at home with colour-critical applications as it is Excel, which is something of a rarity. Turn of speed  No corners have been cut in the performance department. You get your choice of dual-core Core i5 or Core i7 Skylake processors, stretching up to the 2.6GHz Core i7-6600U in this review unit.  With 8GB of LPDDR3 RAM as standard, you can upgrade that to 16GB on the high-end models for $200. Factor in the choice of everything from bog-standard 128GB SSDs to encrypted Opal 2 drives, right up to blazingly fast 512GB NVMe drives, and you can configure models from $2,299 to almost $4,400. I didn’t find the X1 Yoga wanting for performance. This isn’t especially surprising. With a top-of-the-range Core i7, 8GB of RAM and a ridiculously fast 512GB Samsung NVMe SSD inside, you wouldn’t expect this laptop to be slow. The SSD produces read and write speeds that are super- impressive, sequential read speeds tickling the 2,000MB/sec mark, while write speeds still nudge just over 1,000MB/sec. Boot Windows 10 Pro from cold and it’s mere seconds before you land on the desktop. Oddly enough, the Lenovo didn’t perform quite as brilliantly as I expected in our benchmarks. An overall score of 39 puts it a whisker behind the Dell XPS 13 I tested, which contained Intel’s slightly slower 2.5GHz Core i7-6500U processor. I have a sneaking suspicion that Lenovo’s more aggressive power management might be the issue here.  Having used the ThinkPad X1 Yoga in practice, though, I’m confident this laptop will coast through most tasks without blinking. I’d recommend the 16GB of RAM upgrade if you’re a fan of OS virtualisation, but other than that the specification on test here is a match for most people’s needs. Battery life is respectable, too. With the screen brightness set to 170cd/m2 and Wi-Fi off, the X1 Yoga was able to play a movie constantly for 7hrs 55mins. Use a more aggressive power plan, reduce the screen brightness (even 85cd/m2 is fine for most indoor environments), and you’ll be closing the lid and heading home for the day before having to dig the charger out of your bag. Connectivity and security When it comes to connections, it’s probably easier to begin with what’s missing: USB Type-C. While you could argue this isn’t a big loss for a business laptop – and it’s still far from essential on consumer devices – it’s a connector that you may come to miss in time. But that’s the limit of my criticisms of the X1 Yoga’s connection options. There are three USB 3 ports, a OneLink+ port for adding Lenovo’s various optional docking stations, and you get both HDMI and mini-DisplayPort outputs, too. Factor in the fingerprint reader just beneath the keyboard and the X1 Yoga ticks all the right boxes. This review unit, which is currently the priciest pre-configured model on Lenovo’s site, also partners an Intel 802.11ac Wi-Fi chipset with a Sierra Wireless EM7455 LTE modem that supports the fastest mobile broadband speeds going (up to 300Mbits/sec to be precise). However, you can swap the mobile broadband for an Intel WiGig module, which opens the door to high-speed wireless docking stations. Or you might prefer to drop down to the $2,899 configuration, which loses the mobile broadband and goes one rung down the CPU ladder: it includes a i7-6500U chip, not the i7-6600U we tested. Verdict Lenovo has produced some amazing devices in recent times, so it’s no surprise to see it waltz in and do what it does best: produce another brilliant business hybrid. It isn’t cheap – even in its most modest specification, the X1 Yoga is a cool $2,299 – but you most certainly get what you pay for. The screen is large enough to use all day without yearning for an external monitor; everything from the keyboard to the stylus is faultless; there’s a three-year on-site warranty; and the performance is strong enough to please all but the most demanding users.  Factor in the flexibility on offer and it’s nigh-on unbeatable. If you’re in charge of the IT department, order yours now. If not, start begging the person who is.  Related Reviews Review: Lenovo ThinkCentre X1 Review: Asus Transformer Book Flip TP200SA Review: the HP Spectre x2 can't beat the Surface Pro 4 Review: Dell Inspiron 15 5000 2-in-1 Review: Dishonored 2 blinks back into our hearts Source: Copyright © PC & Tech Authority, nextmedia Pty Ltd Copyright © Alphr, Dennis Publishing See more about:  convertible  |  hybrid  |  lenovo  |  pc  |  review  |  thinkpad x1 yoga   Tweet Email this Print this Feedback   Readers of this article also read...   Samsung: When the giant trips     Review: HP ZBook Studio G3     Intel's new 600p series NVMe drives get a fantastic price     Adata launches Ultimate SU800SATA 6Gb/s3D NAND SSD     What we know about...

The prices ranging from slightly mad to properly certifiable. As in the past, it falls to motherboard makers to wine and dine consumers to refreshed X99 platforms; which is doubly hard since many “old” X99 motherboards can support Broadwell-E processors with a simply BIOS update. That being said, the refresh-cycle at this level of computing just makes no sense, since those buying X99 based systems often are tech-savvy enough to know that a refresh offers limited performance benefits. That being said, ASUS being ASUS are always ready and willing to dole out some top level motherboards to help make even the most discerning buyer push rationality aside to purchase this R10 000 or $600 ASUS ROG Rampage V Edition 10 motherboard. I’d like to kindly thank ASUS South Africa for sending me a complete sample system from which this motherboard review is derived. If the X99 STRIX Gaming and RAMPAGE V Extreme had a baby If the Rampage V Extreme and X99 STRIX motherboard had a baby, the ASUS ROG Rampage V Edition 10 would be it. The Rampage V Extreme released as a Haswell-E motherboard built for overclocking, but the X99 STRIX Gaming, with all its RGB and “gaming” focus was conceived as their “gaming” Broadwell-E X99 motherboard.  It seems fitting, then, that ASUS positions this Edition 10 (signifying 10 years of producing Rampage motherboards) as their top tier X99 motherboard for breaking records with “overclocking and gaming innovations”. Combining both overclocking and gaming features into a motherboard will be appreciated by enthusiasts, although it seems a bit of a kick in the nuts to Overclockers as ASUS are charging more for an X99 motherboard with one crucially missing overclocking nicety—the venerable OC Panel II, which happens to be bundled in the cheaper  ASUS Rampage V Extreme. But it’s got RGB LED lighting, and that somehow qualifies an extra R2000. Cynicism aside, there are some extra features bundled in that make up that R2000 extra, such as better audio and a dedicated Supreme HiFi DAC bundled with the motherboard. It’s something I could not test personally as the review system I got never included it, however the research I’ve done does seem to sing its praises as a worthy replacement for the PC Panel. That being said, a lot of the function on the OC panel have been moved to the motherboard itself. The look of the motherboard, in all black, does look immaculate and sexy. Unlike the Rampage V Extreme, ASUS borrowed from their STRIX X99 Gaming and has gone stark raving mad about RGB LEDs. Although RGB lighting on an X99 motherboard is tantamount to neon lighting under fast cars, ambiance does play a part in the computing experience. ASUS have produced a beautiful example of RGB lighting that makes you stare in bewildered awe. The RGB control can control each section with RGB lighting, so the I/O, audio, PCI-Express clips, ROG logos, PCB, and rear panel. If you have an ASUS STRIX Graphics card with LED enabled lighting, you can also sync the system with the graphics card, or vice-versa. Other than the omission of the OC Panel and inclusion of the DAC, there are still far too many features for me to state here (which you can see here) but there are important bits to cover. Since it’s the star of the ASUS line-up, there are no immediate compromises made. There are a total of four PCI-Express 3.0 X16, which can be used in various configurations. Bear in mind, since NVIDIA are only rolling around with official support for Pascal 2-way SLI support, it falls to AMD and CrossfireX to officially populate each slot on the Rampage V Edition 10. As for memory support, the Rampage V Edition 10 supports quad-channel memory up to DDR4 3333MHz (OC) and XMP 2.0. Storage is taken care off with 10 SATA 6GB/s ports, as well as 1X U.2 port with PCIe X4 NVME Storage and a 32GB/s M.2 slot located behind the 24-Pin power connector. The rear I/O port is also chock-full of features as you get 4 3.0 USB ports, 2 USB 3.1 Type A ports and two USB3.1 Type C ports. Dual Intel RJ-45 LAN ports and WiFi Antenna jacks means your bandwidth needs are well catered for (not that it means anything in South Africa with our sub-par infrastructure). We also get your regular Clear CMOS and USB BIOS Flashback button with your dedicated USB BIOS Flash port. For those with software-less keyboards (an anomaly for some spending over R10 000 for a motherboard) you also have your dedicated keybot USB port. Audio is take care of by Realtek ALC1150 powered SupremeFX 8- Channel High definition audio. Related:   ASUS ROG STRIX GTX 1080 OC Review: Aura-inspiring Software & BIOS Diving into the BIOS of an ASUS motherboard presents you with a familiar layout and theme, although I would have thought ASUS would have at least given a special black “Edition 10” theme instead of the stock standard “Red/Black/Grey” of the RoG standard. The BIOS of modern ASUS motherboards are well laid out, although I fear most of the uninitiated will feel a bit lost navigating the plethora of options and tweaking ASUS has provided. EZ Mode would be the place those new to extreme motherboards as it has a few basic overclocking profiles to load up, but for those wanting total access to all the nuts and bolts ASUS have painstakingly created for you, Extreme Tweaker is where it’s at. There are voltages to be tweaked, frequencies adjusted and multipliers to play with on top of all the really esoteric options that pro-overclockers can tweak to squeeze out more performance. ASUS has even gone to the trouble of analysing each core on the CPU to tell you which one is the best performing on the chip (denoted by an asterisk), which means a higher clock can given to that specific core. There are a few more options relating to the multitude of features present in the motherboard, although one of the better features I’ve seen is the memory overclocking presets. ASUS have provided a detailed list of pre-configured memory timings, voltages and frequencies for specific RAM and IC. Other RoG boards also do this (such as my personal ASUS Gene VIII board) but without actually doing some deep research or removing heatsinks to check the RAM modules, you can’t actually determine if you have Samsung memory, Hynix or Micron. On the Rampage V Edition 10, ASUS has added an ingenious IC analyser. Once you follow the steps to determine the type of RAM you have, you can apply the appropriate preset to your memory. Very nifty. Once into Windows, there are also Windows-based tweaking that makes overclocking in Windows dead easy. One can use the solid AI Suite 3 to control even more of your hardware. We have options ranging from basic charging or transfer speeds for devices, all the way to per core or GPU overclocking or determining the CPU VRM Switching frequency for deep tweaking within an OS environment. It’s quite intensive but for the plug and play types you can get the system to create basic fan control profiles or use the one-click 5-Way Optimization by Dual Intelligent Processors 5 to automatically find a stable overclock for your CPU and appropriate fan profile. There is a variety of software included as well, like AURA for RGB lighting, MemTweakIT, GameFirst IV, TurboV Core, KEYBOT II, HomeCloud and Hystream as well as a handful of others not mentioned here; it’s a lot, so visit the website to check the full list. Performance Obviously I took the manual approach to testing the overclocking chops on the 6900K processor, upping the default 3.2GHz to a solid 4.4GHz clock speed. The test system sent by ASUS was the exact same system used to test the ASUS ROG GTX 1080 STRIX OC GPU reviewed earlier this week: Asus ROG Rampage V Edition 10 Motherboard Intel i7 Broadwell-E 6900K @ 4.4GHz 32GB (4x8GB) Corsair LPX DDR4 2133 (13-15-15-28) Corsair Force LE 256GB SSD Cooler Master GX II 650W Cooler Master Nepton  120XL Windows 10 X64 NVIDIA WHQL 372.70 Related:   Tech Talk: Should you buy an Optical or Laser gaming mouse?   Overclocking proved to be extremely rewarding with the ROG Rampage V Edition 10, and even my uninitiated X99 hands were able to bring the monstrous i7 6900K to a 4.4GHz overclock with ease. The OC Zone on the motherboard is essentially the OC Panel integrated onto the motherboard, with MemOK to reset a bad memory overclock, an LED Post Code Debugger display as well as your usual Start/Reset buttons. For the more enthusiast inclined, there is an LN2 Jumper, Slow Mode switch, Retry Button, Safe Boot button, voltage read out points and boot device LEDs. There are even switches to disable PCI-Express slots and memory DIMMS, to really assist troubleshooting very quickly. I barely made use of any of these features, but for those in competitions, saving time troubleshooting is the difference between first and last. Something special that only seems to be supported on the Rampage V Edition 10 is ASUS Thermal Control tool, which essentially tries to manage your overclock depending on the temperature and applications you are running. For instance, a high AVX load (editing, video conversion etc) stresses all the cores and may lead to temperature and stability issues. Conversely, a gaming load can be a lot less intensive on the CPU and result in a bit more thermal headroom to overclock the chip a bit further. So, ASUS Thermal Control manages your overclock in the background, increasing your overclock when under specific loads, while decreasing it and managing temperatures when doing strenuous loads. If there was a single issue I had with the board, it was the placement of the M.2 Slot and the proximity of the first PCI-Express 3.0 slot. First off, if you have any graphics card slotted into the first slot, removing or adding an M.2 device is impossible with a longer graphics card. The second issue is that the top most PCI-Express 3.0 slot is far too close to the heatsink and the clip pretty much touches it. Removing a graphics card there was not as carefree as it should be. Otherwise, layout and spacing was excellent; anyone who populates this motherboard enough to make it seem cramped deserves a slow-clap. If you’d like to see what gaming benchmarks are attributed to the motherboard, have a look at the ASUS ROG GTX 1080 STRIX OC review earlier this week. This slideshow requires JavaScript. To give the extra bit of overclocking and benchmarking capabilities, I’d like to point to the way this motherboard’s memory presets can help boost scores and claim those extra HWBot points. Unlike 3DMark Firestrike Ultra, the increase in CPU and memory performance does little to affect the overall score. However, within 3DMark’s Time Spy DX 12 benchmark, the increase in memory bandwidth has an affect in CPU and overall scores—a testament to how efficiently the DX 12 API makes use of extra CPU–centric computational resources and bandwidth.

It may seem easy and fun to make one, but combining your features and genetics together presents a very expensive trip to the hospital, and subsequent 18 years. However, it’s an investment in their and your future, which initially is expensive, but over time will pay it back eventually. The extended metaphor comparing the ROG Rampage V Edition 10 to a baby, however ghastly, is meant to ease you into the idea that buying something made up from two different motherboards (X99 STRIX and Rampage V Extreme) is an expensive endeavour—but one that will reward you in time as you spend time with it, be it in intense workloads, benchmarking or gaming. Share this: Twitter Reddit Facebook WhatsApp Google More LinkedIn Pinterest Telegram Pocket Conclusion It’s a massive cost to get one of the most feature rich benchmarking and gaming boards on the market, one not many can stomach, but for those willing and able to use it properly, it offers you the means to make the highest performing X99 platform to date.

Who knows, but Qualcomm's designed a modem for it Freeze on refrigerants heats up search for replacements Chinese giant Tencent is dipping a toe into the open-source world, with its own hot-patch system for Android apps. As it notes at its newish GitHub repo, its Tinker hotfix framework “supports dex, library and resources update” without the user having to restart the app. It's targeted at app developers: they add the plugin to the build environment for a project's root; edit the build.gradle for the project; make some mods to the apps' subclasses, and make the application itself a subclass of TinkerApplication. Tencent's devs say they have made support for Android Studio Proguard automatic, and Tinker “will also generate the multiDex keep Proguard file for you”. Tencent is following another well-known Chinese developer into the open source world. In September, Baidu published its deep learning models on GitHub. Its other contributions include a file system and an “internet-scale” database. Tinker is Tencent's second public project so far. The company behind WeChat has also offered up a suite of test automation tools, QTAF, with drivers for iOS and Android. Given that it's often described as “secretive”, it will be interesting to watch how Tencent – which in September was nominated as Asia's largest company by market capitalisation – responds to the more boisterous world of open source software. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 2 Comments More from The Register Regulators, take note: Tencent is now Asia's biggest company It's worth how much? 5 Comments Baidu peddles PaddlesPaddles, floats open source AI tech Deep learning suite with Python front end Baidu Research grills AI models on deep learning Tool aims to reduce machine-training time UK NHS 850k Reply-all email fail: State health service blames Accenture Cause was system 'bug,' not user error, claims mouthpiece 12 Comments Tencent targets Alibaba, seeds data cloud with £1 BEELLLION Chinese tech giants strap on the boxing gloves Tencent stripped of antivirus rankings for cheating on tests Another week, another Chinese firm accused of gaming system 4 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

That's according to an Australian National University (ANU) survey that's mostly been written up from the press release but which The Reg has considered a little more deeply. The full report, here, lists out the questions from page 24 of the PDF. It finds (“don't knows” are excluded from the reporting) that two-thirds of Australians think the data retention regime is justified and one-third do not. Just one-quarter of respondents could correctly identify Australia's defence budget as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) – around two per cent – with 65 per cent putting the figure at five per cent, 10 per cent, or more than 10 per cent (and 10 per cent panicking that we're spending less than a single per cent). Worry about being caught up in a terrorist incident (which in Australia is a little more likely than having a Galaxy Note 7 catch fire in a pocket) is a near-even split, with 45.5 per cent of Australians “very” or “somewhat” concerned that they or a family member will be a victim of a future attack in Australia; 54.5 per cent aren't worried. The public seems distinctly confused about what to do on the topic of terrorism: 55.7 per cent of the respondents believe the government “could do more” about it; but not if it's going to cost more, because an even higher proportion – 59.7 per cent – believe the government is spending “about the right amount of money” on anti-terrorism measures. Returning to attitudes to data retention, this observation, on page eight of the report, is telling: “When framed as a trade-off between civil liberties and national security, 46 per cent of Australians believe counter-terrorism measures have not gone far enough to protect the country.” In other words – a detail that's missed in the Australian National University's canned statement – the people conducting the survey acknowledge the importance of framing, when considering questions of civil liberties versus national security. The report is the result of a random phone survey of 1,200 respondents, with an error margin of plus or minus 2.5 per cent. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 4 Comments More from The Register Data retention grants still not flowing to Australia telcos Carriers still in the dark about how much they'll get or when ahead of April 2017 deadline 7 Comments IT analyst: Oz census data processed as plain text Data appears to be encrypted in transit, but not at rest 20 Comments Australia's IBM-assisted Census fail burned AU$30 MEEELLION How to spend $10 million A DAY fixing a web site 12 Comments Australia's online Census collapses, international hackers blamed 'Four attacks' on SoftLayer-hosted service 17 Comments IBM botched geo-block designed to save Australia's census Bureau of Stats says spooks signed off IBM's plan, but Big Blue mucked something up 38 Comments Australian national census fails in the IBM cloud UPDATE Online form goes down hard ... and stays down 38 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

The Stratix 10 family is part of the company's push beyond its stagnating PC-and-servers homeland into emerging markets like high-performance computing and software-defined networking. Intel says the quad-core 64-bit ARM Cortex-A53 processor helps position the device for “high-end compute and data-intensive applications ranging from data centres, network infrastructure, cloud computing, and radar and imaging systems.” Compared to the Stratix V, Altera's current generation before the Chipzilla slurp, Intel says the Stratix 10 has five times the density and twice the performance; 70 per cent lower power consumption at equivalent performance; 10 Tflops (single precision); and 1 TBps memory bandwidth. The devices will be pitched at acceleration and high-performance networking kit. The Stratix 10 “Hyperflex architecture” uses bypassable registers – yes, they're called “Hyper-Registers”, which are associated with individual routing segments in the chip, and are available at the inputs of “all functional blocks” like adaptive logic modules (ALMs), embedded memory blocks, and digital signal processing (DSP) blocks. Designs can bypass individual Hyper-Registers, so design tools can automatically choose the best register location. Intel says this means “performance tuning does not require additional ALM resources … and does not require additional changes or added complexity to the design's place-and-route.” The company reckons the design also cuts down on on-chip routing congestion.

Should Target With Custom Foundry Efforts Intel should try to build graphics chips for NVIDIA and mobile processors for Apple. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 10, 2016 at 4:04PM Image source: Intel.  Ever since current Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich took the helm back in 2013, it's been crystal clear that the chipmaker is very interested in building out a significant contract chip manufacturing business. Indeed, at the company's 2013 investor meeting, Krzanich showed a slide that said that Intel aimed to "open foundry to any company able to utilize our leading-edge silicon." Since then, Intel has announced a handful of contract chip manufacturing deals, ranging from programmable-logic vendor Altera to mobile processor specialist Spreadtrum. Once the products developed as part of these agreements begin shipping, the company might finally be able to report significant revenue from its custom foundry efforts. Nevertheless, the deals Intel has announced so far represent reasonable first steps, but for contract chip manufacturing to become a significant business for the chipmaker, it's going to have to aim for more substantial deals. Let's look at two companies with whom Intel should aggressively pursue contract chip manufacturing deals. Augmenting its gaming business One of the portions of Intel's personal-computer processor business that has done very well even in the face of a weak overall personal computer market is gaming. Gaming is one of the few "killer applications" that benefits from Intel's state-of-the-art microprocessors. As important as fast processors are to this market, specialized graphics processors, also known as GPUs, are even more critical to this market. It would be very difficult for Intel to participate in this market with an organically developed solution, and I don't think acquiring a successful gaming graphics processor vendor outright would be the way Intel would want to attack this. However, striking a deal as a contract manufacturer for NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), the most successful vendor of standalone graphics processors, particularly for gaming, could be a nice way to gain more content in this market. NVIDIA's relationship with contract chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) is quite deep so it would likely be difficult for Intel to convince NVIDIA to switch over some of its products, particularly the high-value gaming-oriented chips. Nevertheless, if Intel could win a high-volume SKU or two over at NVIDIA, that could be a nice win for the former. The king in Cupertino If there is a contract chip win that would generate buzz for Intel in mobile, it'd be Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL). Apple ships a couple of hundred million high-end smartphone and tablet applications processors each year, which means that there are billions of dollars in potential revenue to be had from serving as a contract manufacturer for these Apple-designed processors. Historically, Samsung and TSMC have built chips for Apple, with Samsung serving as the exclusive manufacturer of the A-series chips through the A7 and splitting the A9 with TSMC, while TSMC exclusively manufactured the A8 and the most recently launched A10. Although Apple is widely known for its demanding commercial terms when it comes to suppliers, it also seems to really prioritize having best-in-class manufacturing technologies to allow their best-in-class chip designs to shine. Intel has demonstrated clear leadership in high-performance PC and server parts, but its mobile processors never were anything spectacular. So if Intel's technology here is really as great as it tells investors it is, then it might be able to strike a deal with Apple -- at the very least as a second source to TSMC with a minority allocation of a future A-series chips.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Altera launches Stratix 10 FPGAs with HBM2 in tow by Wayne Manion  12:30 PM on October 10, 2016 Intel subsidiary Altera has launched the Stratix 10 field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The Stratix 10 comprises 5.5 million logic elements, HBM2 memory, and a quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 processor. Those components are joined together using what Altera dubs Heterogeneous 3D System-in-Package (SiP) integration. The upshot of this stack of acronyms is up to 10 TFLOPS of single-precision output and 10 Tbps of local memory bandwidth to go along with up to 30 Gbps of chip-to-chip capacity. The new chips are built on Intel's 14-nm FinFET (Tri-Gate) fabrication process. Altera claims a doubling of performance or a 70% power reduction at equivalent performance level when compared to previous-generation products. An integrated Secure Device Manager block ensures the integrity and security of data. The Stratix 10's main job is to ultimately act as a coprocessor within a more conventional server, as the ARM CPU's job is to provide memory management and other services to the FPGA. Like modern GPUs, FPGAs excel in execution of extremely parallel workloads, but with near-ASIC levels of application specificity. The FPGA's primary advantage over an ASIC (application-specific integrated c is that an FPGA's logic units can be reconfigured at a programmer's whim. Altera says the Stratix 10 should be software-compatible with previous-generation Arris FPGA chips. Bing researchers at Microsoft are surely very excited about the promises of increased efficiency. The Stratix 10 is now sampling to "select customers."

Tours.com's Travel-Intel Looks at a Recent Study Showing Most Americans Still Wary of Traveling to the Rogue State SAN FRANCISCO, CA--(Marketwired - October 10, 2016) - Cuba has been making waves since the U.S. State Department relaxed rules last year for American tourists who may want to travel there. Since then there has been a surge of interest from Americans, and airline companies and cruise lines have been lining up with itineraries and routes for the 90-mile trip across the straits from Florida. However, as reported in the latest issue of Travel-Intel, most Americans who have expressed interest in traveling to Cuba are actually unlikely to do so. The study, conducted by Allianz Global Assistance found that 70 percent of those Americans most likely to travel to Cuba would, in the end, decline the option. Reasons? Safety, lack of traveler information, and concern over the politics of the country. The study is detailed in the latest issue of Travel-Intel, a weekly publication sent to 103,000 travel agents in North America and posted on Tours.com for travel consumers to read. The publication also looks at sustainable travel -- a segment of the travel industry that has been growing at a healthy clip: about 65 percent per year between 2009 and 2012 and showing up as a strongly emergent category of travel. The article details eight adventurous tours, such as trekking in Patagonia and "slow food" cycling through Tuscany, which keep sustainable travel as a focus. In other news, Travel-Intel features hot travel spots in Indochina for travelers looking for luxury and wows in stays in Viet Nam, Thailand and Cambodia. An article reviews the Reverie Saigon in Ho Chi Minh City, The Siam in Bangkok and Saa Private Island in Cambodia, all members of the exclusive Kurtz-Ahlers collection of luxury hotels, resorts and destination specialists. For cruise enthusiasts, Travel-Intel focuses in on new ways cruise lines are raising the bar on onboard edification with culinary classes, cultural exposure, astronomy sessions, even acting classes with members of dramatic arts troupes. Finally, Travel-Intel offers an article on rising trends in solo travel and best international cities to feel the comforts and joys of traveling alone. Travel-Intel is written by travel industry journalists and focuses on changing trends in travel. Stories come from a variety of places and perspectives, including intel from travel industry conferences and expos, or first person experiences at popular hotels, exotic resorts, cruise ships and ports, and destinations near and far. Current issues and archives can be viewed at www.travel-intel.com. "We keep tabs on the travel industry so travel agents and travelling consumers can stay current with favored destinations and places in the world they want to go," says Lark Gould, content editor for Travel-Intel. As a veteran travel journalist who has been covering the travel industry for more than 30 years, Lark Gould puts he incisive perspective into the weekly publication, with features and news updates, and also "packages" issues that present great travel deals to be found at hotels and resort locations worldwide.

I have downloaded the driver from the Asus support site. The file is called "ITBM_driver_V1_0_0_1025" and when I start the AsusSetup64.exe I get an error where it says "Install Failed". I then try to download Intel's own drivers and still the same driver version as the one on the Asus support site. But when I start the installation it comes out with another error which says: "This computer does not meet the minimum requirements for installing the software" Now I know that it has something to do with the bios being able to support the Turbo Boost 3.0 technology. But after upgrading my bios two times and still getting the same error, I want to know what I am doing wrong. I need to clarify, that I have enabled the Intel Turbo options in the bios, but the error is still showing up, when I try to install the drivers. I have also updated the Ai suite 3 to the newest version and all the software that comes with it. I really hope you can help me.

Thanks for your answers so far Yea like said the Ai Suite "Optimization" is just an auto-overclocker and has nothing to do with Intel Turbo Boost 3.0 drivers. It's actually kind of normal that it crashes as it tries to find the highest possible clock (and usually fails). You will however get much better results overclocking manually from BIOS. You can do the same things in Ai Suite but it's prone to making things go wrong in my experience. You can keep AI Suite running though after you've done tweaking BIOS if you want to use it for monitoring/fan control etc.     AsiJu View Public Profile Find all posts by AsiJu   (#13) terrybogard Newbie     Videocard: Geforce GTX 980TI 6GB Processor: Intel Core I7 5930K Mainboard: Asus Rampage V USB3.0 Memory: 32GB DDR4-2400 Crucial Soundcard: Realtek ALC1150 "Onboard" PSU: Corsair CX 750M 10-15-2016, 18:08 | posts: 21 | Location: Denmark Quote: Originally Posted by AsiJu Yea like said the Ai Suite "Optimization" is just an auto-overclocker and has nothing to do with Intel Turbo Boost 3.0 drivers.

That solved the problem with the crash during the test at least But yeah I think you are right about the overclocking is meant to be done in the Bios and not by Ai Suite 3     terrybogard View Public Profile Find all posts by terrybogard   (#14) AsiJu Maha Guru     Videocard: EVGA 980Ti SC+ / Xtreme 4 Processor: i5-4690K @ 4.5GHz/1.22 V Mainboard: ASRock Z97 Pro3 Memory: HyperX DDR3-2400 24 GB Soundcard: X-Fi Titanium + Z906 PSU: Tt.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 10, 2016 at 9:25AM Image source: Intel.  Just about every tech investor has heard of chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The company provides the chips for the vast majority of the personal computers and servers that are sold each year, generates more revenue than any other publicly traded chip company, and is wildly profitable. It's also a very controversial name. Though the chipmaker holds dominant positions in several very lucrative markets, it has had a tough time branching out beyond its core business. Its efforts to attack the mobile processor market simply haven't worked, and its efforts to serve as a contract chip manufacturer haven't yet delivered much in the way of revenue. Today I'd like to go over a few things about Intel that may be helpful to both current investors as well as to those considering taking a position in the stock. Who are Intel's biggest customers? According to Intel's latest annual report, the company's three largest customers during 2015 were as follows: 18% of Intel's total revenue in 2015 (or roughly $10 billion) came from sales to HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ) and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE). HP Inc. is a major provider of personal computers while Hewlett-Packard Enterprise is a major server hardware vendor. 15% of Intel's revenue in 2015 came from sales to privately held Dell. Dell, like HP Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, is a major provider of both personal computers and servers. 13% of Intel's 2015 revenue came from Lenovo (NASDAQOTH: LNVGY), also a major vendor of personal computers and servers. The chipmaker says that "no other customer accounted for more than 10% of [its] net revenue" in 2015. Although Dell is privately held and doesn't disclose financial results, the information above suggests that current and potential Intel investors may be well-served to pay close attention to the financial results and related commentary from HP Inc., Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, and Lenovo (all three are publicly traded) for "hints" as to where Intel's business may be headed. Significant dependence on personal computer market In its most recent 10-K filing, Intel provided breakdowns of its revenue by segment for 2013, 2014, and 2015, as you can see below: DCG = data center group. IOTG = Internet of Things group. SSG = software and services operating segments. CCG = client computing group. Image source: Intel. More than half of the company's revenue in 2015 still came from sales of chips into personal computers, though that figure has come down from 66% in 2013 to 58% in 2015 (partially as a result of the growth of other segments, but partially as a result of the decline in overall personal computer sales). What this means for investors is that although Intel's revenue base is becoming increasingly diversified (particularly as its data center business continues to grow), its financial health is still substantially a function of the health of the overall personal computer market. This means that investors shouldn't dismiss any positive or negative data points around the personal computer market, because odds are that, good or bad, they could be quite meaningful to the chipmaker's financial results (and, potentially, its stock price). Intel's future is in the data center That being said, investors will notice that the company's data center group (commonly abbreviated DCG) is a substantial and rapidly growing portion of its revenue base. In 2015, it hit 29% of revenue, and it probably won't be too long before it crosses the 33% threshold. This means that, as far as investors should be concerned, the health of the overall server market as well as Intel's ability to maintain share and grow chip content there should also be quite important. And, over time, this segment is only going to become more important to the company. The good news is that the overall market for data center processors and related solutions is quite robust, as Intel's growth in this segment over the years shows. The bad news, though, is that Intel is likely to face competitive pressures here over the next several years, meaning that Intel's ability to defend its high market share in key areas (such as enterprise and cloud servers) will become increasingly important to the narrative around the company.  Interestingly, Intel's data center group is large enough today to, given a reasonable amount of growth, offset declines in the personal computer market. Indeed, in 2015, Intel's client computing group, or CCG, took in $32.219 billion in revenue, while its data center group raked in $15.977 billion in revenue. Based on those figures, for every 1% decline in CCG revenue, it would take about a 2.02% increase in DCG revenue to keep total revenue flat. Over time, as DCG becomes larger (and, presumably, CCG becomes smaller), it should take less growth from DCG on a percentage basis to offset declines in CCG going forward.   Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Ronald Reagan trailed Jimmy Carter by 15 points in February-March of 1980. Then Reagan came back and won in a 44 state landslide. One thing is for sure, the U.S. dollar is expected to weaken regardless of the final outcome, and for companies that thrive on a weaker greenback, 2017 could be a great year. We screened the Merrill Lynch database for stocks that were rated Buy, that also did a significant amount of their sales and business overseas. We found four that look very attractive, and could make good sense as we head to 2017. General Electric This iconic blue chip industrial was on a roll but has sold off 15% since July and is giving investors a nice entry point. General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) is a highly diversified, global industrial corporation. Its businesses are organized broadly under six segments: GE Capital, Energy Infrastructure, Aviation, Healthcare, Transportation and Home & Business Solutions. Its products and services include power generation equipment, aircraft engines, locomotives, medical equipment, appliances, commercial leasing and personal finance. Wall Street analysts feel that the American giant will be a large player in the efficient energy field. While the analysts recently lowered earnings expectations for the quarter slightly, they remain positive as expectations for orders and free cash flow already seem very low. They also note that the industrial giant has a massive $25 billion in cash, which could be put to use to drive earnings toward $2 a share by 2018. GE shareholders are paid a 3.16% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price target for the stock is $37, and the Wall Street consensus target is $33.13. The shares closed last Friday at $29.08. Intel This leader in semiconductors is working hard to scale away from dependence on personal computers. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) designs, manufactures and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide. The company’s platforms are used in various computing applications comprising notebooks, two-in-one systems, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, wireless and wired connectivity products, wearables, retail devices and manufacturing devices, as well as for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings, home use and other market segments. The company also provides communication and connectivity offerings, such as baseband processors, radio frequency transceivers and power management integrated circuits, and tablet, phone and Internet of Things solutions, which include multimode 4G LTE modems, Bluetooth technology and GPS receivers, software solutions and interoperability tests, as well as home gateway and set-top box components. Intel reported an inline second quarter, but data center sales came in way below expectations. However, a new partnership with Microsoft for virtual reality, and a consistent shift away for reliance on chips for personal computers, keeps the stock a compelling buy. Intel does a stunning 82.4% of its sales overseas, the lion’s share of it in Asia, where the chips that it produces are used in personal computers, tablets and other personal electronic devices. Intel investors are paid a solid 2.73% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price target is $45, while the consensus target is lower at $40.38. The shares closed Friday at $38.10.

Customers who are interested in a new Kaby Lake BRIX can choose one of three processors in the 0.46L (34.4 x 112.6 x 119.4mm), or slightly taller 0.6L (46.8 x 112.6 x 119.4mm) chassis. If you opt for the taller (46.8mm) chassis you can fit both a 2.5-inch drive and an M.2 SSD. Users of the shorter (34.4mm) chassis can only fit an M.2 SSD. The following are the new processor options; the Intel Core i3-7100U, Core i5-7200U, or Core i7-7500U processors. All these are 2C/4T processors. I've tabulated their base performance specs below.   Intel Core i3-7100U Processor Intel Core i5-7200U Processor Intel Core i7-7500U Processor Cores 2 2 2 Threads 4 4 4 Processor Base Frequency 2.4GHz 2.5GHz 2.7GHz Max Turbo Frequency N/A 3.1GHz 3.5GHz Cache 3MB SmartCache 3MB SmartCache 4MB SmartCache Bus Speed 4GT/s OPI 4GT/s OPI 4GT/s OPI TDP 15W 15W 15W   All the above processors are equipped with Intel HD Graphics 620 with a 300MHz base freq, which can boost to 1GHz (1.05GHz for the i7). These systems support up to 32GB of DDR4 2133MHz memory (two SO-DIMM slots). With compact systems such as these BRIX, the integrated graphics are extremely important. Intel's Kaby Lake graphics are said to provide about a 10 per cent uplift over the previous generation BRIX machines, plus the new HEVC 10-bit hardware acceleration for superior 4K playback and content creation could be an important consideration. Gigabyte's VESA mountable BRIX offer a good selection of connectivity options such as; 1x USB 3.1 Type-C port, 1x USB 3.1 TYpe-A port, 2x USB 3.0 ports, HDMI 2.0, DisplayPort, Gigabit Ethernet, Dual Band Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2, Combo Audio jack. Remember these are barebones machines so you will have to add your own memory, storage, and OS to make a complete working system.

Information on this is incredibly hard to find.) Imagine that your laptop or your PC gets stolen. That would be terrible. However, it would be even worse if your laptop contained confidential data, either your own or that of your employer or client. It’s clear that encrypting one’s hard drive has become a necessity. There are good open source software solutions for this, for example TrueCrypt (Windows, Linux and OSX) and the LUKS/dm-crypt system. However, such software encryption systems require a small chunk of your CPU capacity, and also affect SSD performance and durability to a lesser or greater extent, depending on the controller. Intel 520 self-encrypting SSD. Image courtesy of Anand Tech. A number of SSD drives now implement real-time AES encryption in hardware. Usually the reason for this is to enable fast secure erase: When the AES keys are destroyed by the firmware, a very cheap operation that requires almost no writing to the flash, no data on the whole SSD can be read, and can thus the data can be considered securely erased. The encryption and decryption take place in the controller hardware, so there is no performance hit. The Sandforce SF2281 controller is one of the more well-known SSD controllers that does this. In some cases, the manufacterer uses the HDD password or ATA password (configurable via many laptop BIOSes, very few desktop BIOSes, or the ATASX BIOS extension) to encrypt the AES keys. This means that even if the manufacturer got hold of your drive, and you had set a strong ATA password, they would probably never be able to decrypt your data. I call this usable built-in-hardware-based full disk encryption. In these cases, you do NOT need to install third-party software full disk encryption, and can enjoy the full performance of your SSD. In many other cases, the encryption keys are stored in the drive firmware, but are NOT explicitly encrypted with a user-supplied password. This is non-usable encryption, because in theory the manufacturer or a sufficiently skilled hardware hacker can extract the encryption keys from the drive firmware and decrypt all of your data. In these cases, you ABSOLUTELY have to use a third-party software disk encryption software tool. The purpose of this post is to keep a list of current SSDs with usable and non-usable built-in hardware-based full disk encryption. Whilst recently shopping for a suitable SSD, this information was unreasonably hard to come by, hence this list. If you have additions or corrections, please let me know in the comments. SSDs with USABLE built-in encryption: Intel 320 This post and this post by an Intel representative confirm that the AES keys on the Intel 320 SSD are encrypted with the user’s ATA password. The second gives more detail on the implementation details, for example that the ATA password itself is also stored in non-reversible hashed form in the drive firmware. The white paper linked to under the Intel 520 heading below confirms the working of the 320 encryption setup. Intel 520 This is the first Intel SSD making use of the Sandforce SF-2281 controller. Due to a bug in the controller, the drive does AES-128 encryption (instead of the advertised AES-256). AES-128 is still considered to be sufficient for most purposes. After two unsuccessful attempts getting a clear answer on the details of the Intel 520 encryption directly from Intel support, I finally stumbled on this white paper by Intel: Managing Intel Solid-State Drives Using Intel vPro Technology (mirror here). On page 3, in the grey box at the bottom of the page, we see the following text (bold words by me): How Self-encrypting drives (SEDs) Work: SEDs, such as the Intel® SSD 320 Series and Intel® SSD 520 Series, have a drive controller that automatically encrypts all data to the drive and decrypts all the data from the drive. The disk encryption key is never present in the computer’s processor or memory, where it could be accessed by hackers. The key used to encrypt and decrypt is securely stored only on the drive. Because the disk encryption key is encrypted with the ATA (Advanced Technology Attachment) passwords, the key is made accessible to the drive only after successful user authentication; without the key the data remains encrypted on the media. Authentication of the user is done within the SED by supplying the ATA user password, which is isolated from the OS. Therefore, attacks on OS vulnerabilities cannot affect an SED’s pre-boot process. That’s a pretty conclusive statement by Intel that both the 320 and the 520 encrypt their AES encryption key with the user-supplied ATA password. After a few weeks and some mails with Intel tech support, I also received the following confirmation concerning the Intel 520 SSD: Yes, ATA password is used to encrypt the encryption keys stores on the SSD. In other words: The Encryption Keys depends on the ATA password to decrypt them. The ATA password is not used in combination with the Encryption Keys to encrypt the data. Intel support furthermore confirmed that the Intel 520 is compliant with FIPS-197. SSDs with PERHAPS USABLE built-in encryption In these cases there are indications that the mentioned drives are encrypting the encryption keys with the ATA user password, but I have not been able to find more conclusive confirmation. If you find anything, please let me know it the comments, because eventually I’d like to move them out to the list of USABLE or NON-USABLE encryption. Plextor M5 Pro On the product page the graphic shows quite clearly that ata passwords are related to encryption keys, but it does not specify in which way these are linked. A reasonable approach would of course be that the key is encrypted with the ATA password, but until that’s confirmed, this drive remains on the “perhaps”-list. Samsung 840 Pro Again it’s far too hard to find conclusive information on the encryption implementation. On this product page, we find the following text: Keep your data safe with Self-Encrypting Drive (SED) Technology Simply enable an HDD password via your computer’s BIOS, and Samsung’s SSD 840 applies data encryption automatically. This is not as conclusive as I’d like, but there is an implication that there’s a link between the HDD password and the encryption on the Samsung. Samsung PM830 This drive is not to be confused with the consumer-oriented Samsung 830. The PM830 is a special professional OEM version, found for example in Dell Latitude laptops. There are indications, such as this great 2012 overview paper, titled Hardware-based Full Disk Encryption (In)Security Survey, by Tilo Muller, Tobias Latzo, and Felix C. Freiling (accompanying website with demonstration videos), which mention the PM830 as an example of hardware-based full disk encryption. I’m still searching for the cited spec document that might confirm whether the PM830 encrypts its AES-256 keys with the ATA password, and also the possible password-length limitations. SSDs with NON-USABLE built-in encryption OCZ Agility / Vertex 2 / 3 / 4 In this posting on the OCZ Technology Forum, we see that in at least some of the OCZ SSDs, “The encryption key is not directly linked to the ATA Security password (or the BIOS password).” I have not been able to find more specific information about other OCZ offerings. However, my expectations are not very high based on this previous work by OCZ. Conclusion Manufacturers of SSDs with built-in encryption are doing an absolutely TERRIBLE job of informing their customers of their specific encryption implementations. For something as critical as full disk encryption, I would expect full disclosure. If the encryption approach is good, disclosing its details won’t affect its security. The only SSDs that I’d recommend in terms of usable built-in disk encryption are the Intel 320 and 520 drives. It would be great if this list could be expanded. If you have a direct connection to the relevant persons at the various manufacturers, please make use of this and let me know of the results so I can update this blog post. Your BIOS has to support the full 32 character ATA password specification. The Samsung laptop I’m typing this on only supports 8  character ATA passwords, so I’d think carefully about installing a hardware-based encrypted SSD in here. My desktop with the Intel 520 SSD has the ATASX bios extension and supports up to the full 32 characters. When you buy a new laptop or motherboard, make sure it has a good ATA security extensions implementation, supporting the full 32 characters. Although ideally the built-in hardware encryption would be usable and secure, the disappointing state of affairs leads me to the conclusion that a good option at this point is still to select an SSD that is impacted as little as possible by the software encryption (avoid the Sandforce controllers, or any other controllers that make use of hardware compression), and then use a solution such as TrueCrypt or luks/dm-crypt (even for a non-Sandforce controller such as on the OCZ Vertex 4, the negative impact is significant, unfortunately). For my next SSD purchase, I will again compare the super-fast hardware encryption of the Intel 520 vs. SSDs that are able to cope to some extent with software encryption, although I am currently leaning towards the Intel 520. Other resources I’ve written another post documenting my successful experience with r0m30’s open source TCG Opal configuration utility and PBA image. Vincent Tenniglo sent in this article by AnandTech where Anand himself experiments with the TCP Opal 2.0 compliant Crucial M500 and the Windows 8 eDrive support. In theory, with eDrive-compatible drives (meaning Opal 2.0), Windows BitLocker makes use of the drive’s hardware encryption. Ed: Because this is Windows closed-source, we are unfortunately even less sure of what’s happening behind the scenes. It’s an interesting development nonetheless.

This also supports AES 256-bit encryption. According to http://joeraff.org/20120704/software-encrypted-ssd-performance-a-surprising-outcome/ it does use the HDD password but only supports 8 character MAX which is not that great. But I think you could add it next to the 840 in the list. Reply cpbotha says: December 23, 2012 at 23:43 Pieter, thanks for popping by! As I understood, the consumer 830 does not expose encryption to the user. Some OEM versions, like the one in your Dell, reportedly do. That blog (I fixed your link) is a bit thin on sources. I did some more searching and found this: http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/19/DriverDetails?driverId=F76F0 Is the 830 in your Dell also a “Samsung PM830 256GB FDE 7MM”? The FDE in there = full disk encryption. It also seems the PM830 (vs just the “830) is the professional version only found in OEM products. I think I can add this specific model to the “PERHAPS” list. Please do keep me up to date if you run into more details as to the link between ATA password and the AES keys, as well as the 8-character limit. Reply data says: February 14, 2013 at 18:20 I am currently evaluating this as well, and it seems that at least mainboards from intel and asrock have the same 8 character limit. I am left wondering if this enables brute force attacks, as this really depends on drive behavior. Old drives used to be restarted every 5 tries, which made brute forcing even for the shorter password pretty much prohibitively expensive. But many drives also had backdoors and master passwords, and I am not really comfortable with this idea. The 8 character limit might stem from the fact that the maximum length for an ATA password is 32 bytes, which might fit depending on the encoding and localization. On the other hand, 8 characters is just the old unix limit which has been dragging security down in many places just because it always was so, and we all know that BIOS development isn’t really on the forefront of anything. Reply Peter says: February 15, 2013 at 10:38 Any chance you can confirm or not on the 520’s: 1: A TPM chip is NOT required period for this to work. The TCG OPAL standard states it not in the FAQ (http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/files/static_page_files/B1105605-1D09-3519-AD6FD7F6056B2309/Opal_SSC_FAQ_final_Jan_27_4_.pdf) but would love it confirmed before I spend money AS Intel never stated, far as I can tell, these are officially Opal compliant. 2: Happen to know if Intel plans to fix the controller? I.e. is it a hardware failure or something they can fix in the future via a firmware update. Reply cpbotha says: March 9, 2013 at 12:25 1. It does NOT require a TPM chip. I am running the Intel 520 with encryption on a board without any TPM. 2. What do you mean by “fix the controller”? If you’re referring to the AES-128 instead of AES-256 support, probably not. Reply Geoff says: March 3, 2013 at 19:37 One BIG question concerning any/all of these drives having usable crypto built-in: At what point are the keys used to encrypt/decrypt the actual drive generated? I understand the details of encrypting those keys by way of an HDD password, but I wonder, what is generating the actual keys in the first place? Can the consumer do anything to change those keys? What algorithm is used to generate the keys? How is it seeded? Exactly what algorithm is used to hash the keys? According to a post at AandDTech, someone spoke with Samsung who stated that the 840 Pro requires a bios capable of setting an HDD password AND contains a TPM chip. If that’s true, then people having systems without a TPM will be lulled into believing that they have locked-down their drive by setting an HDD password. You also pointed out the need for a bios that supports 32 character passwords — yet another major detail that the drive manufacturers don’t specify. I assume that the process of manufacturing the drive includes generating keys that it will use. Is there a way to change those keys before you use the drive for the first time? If not, then isn’t it possible that a record of each drive’s serial number and its key exists somewhere? Any reasonable documentation that outlines how *anything* implements crypto technology begins with an explanation of how the underlying key(s) in play are generated. PGP, TruCrypt, and MSFT Bitlocker all document very thoroughly details concerning what/how/when keys are generated, the exact algorithms used to encrypt those keys, where the keys are stored, and the protocols for decrypting those keys. The complete lack of documentation regarding the self-encryping drive’s crypto technology makes the security of those drives highly questionable. Finally, I think its noteworthy that modern processors all have hardware encryption/decryption built-into the chips themselves, so there won’t be any major performance benefit of using a self-encrypting drive in a system using something like an Intel i7 chip. In the little bit of testing I have done on a box containing an i7 chip, I have seen very little perf. degradation by turning-on Bitlocker with 128 bit AES encryption. I like the idea that a self-encrypting drive is going to be immune to O/S pre-boot holes. Self-encrypting drives also don’t come with the headaches associated with backing up and restoring systems using software encryption. These are major benefits. Its really too bad that the technology in self-encrypting drives is so dubious. Reply cpbotha says: March 4, 2013 at 09:20 1. When you do a secure erase (recommended when starting with a new SSD), the firmware generates a new random encryption key. This is one of the reasons for implementing hardware-based AES encryption: fast secure erase! 2. The performance impact of third-party software encryption on SSD drives is significant. This is not due to the CPU needing more time (you’re right that AES-NI helps here), but due to the way modern SSDs store your data. Encrypting the data in software beforehand negates a whole bunch of optimizations in the SSD, leading to severe performance degradation. Reply Geoff says: March 6, 2013 at 18:40 Thank you for the response. I’m wondering if you would elaborate on your statement that 3rd party FDD software causes a significant perf. hit due to the way modern SSD’s store data. It seems to me that one stream of bits is just as good (or bad) as any other. Whether the bits were previously encrypted by software or not is entirely transparent to the SSD controller, so should not affect in any way how an SSD stores those bits. All the SSD controller knows is that the O.S. has given it a stream of bits with an instruction to serialize them to its storage medium. It shouldn’t know or care where those bits were before they arrived at the SSD. No matter what went-on during their prior journey, all bits are entitled to the same love and equal treatment under the laws set forth in the firmware code. The processes, procedures, and optimizations it undertakes should be the same on the bits, whether encrypted or not. Am I wrong? Reply cpbotha says: March 7, 2013 at 21:18 You are wrong. 🙂 Many modern SSDs use on-the-fly compression to improve performance. Not only the well-known Sandforce controllers do this, also many of the custom firmware designs. Encrypting the data beforehand makes it significantly less compressible. Read this answer on superuser.com for more this and more problems with compressing SSDs + third party encryption: http://superuser.com/a/358137/130835 Even with the Crucial m4, which does not compress data on the fly, third party encryption still has a significant effect: http://www.ausgamers.com/forums/general/thread.php/3236998#post3237039 (the poster claims it’s not a problem, but looking at the measurements, that’s a huge hit) The bottom-line is that SSDs use all kinds of tricks (modern ones have multiple processors on the drive!) to increase performance and increase the lifetime of the drive. Your logic that all types of data should be the same in the eyes of the drive does not hold anymore. 🙂 Reply Flo says: October 16, 2013 at 14:47 I asked Samsung support about the requirement of a TPM chip for the SSD 840 EVO. The answer was, that an TPM chip is NOT required for the encryption to work. The only requirement is , that the bios is able to set / pass the password to the ssd controller. By the way, not only the unknown implementation of the encryption in the ssd hardware is a potential security risk, but also using the Bios functions for setting the HDD password. For example, I figured out that my DELL E6400 sets only the ATA-User-Password to the password that I provided, but sets a second so-called ATA-Master-Password to a unknown “dell secret”. This means, DELL would probably be able to unlock the drive or a script kiddy that could find a DELL HDD keygenerator online… Solution for this is as follows: Don’t use any Bios functions to set HDD Passwords, do it directly with HDPARM tool in e.g. Parted Magic. Reply JohnS says: October 31, 2013 at 23:15 Not to worry. The Master password (which is generally fixed in the BIOS, you can’t set it) has two modes. One is that it simply acts as a second password. This is really stupid since, as you observed, only a zillion people probably know it. There goes any security you were trying to achieve. The other mode only allows the Master password to be used to reset the drive, effectively wiping any data on it. Should you forget your password (or someone steals it), this mode doesn’t allow you to recover the data, but you can recover the drive and start over. Note: Any password you set with a tool like HDPARM can be read by anyone else. This varies per drive vendor, but I understand that most do store it only as a hash. If so, and if you use a REALLY GOOD password, then you are OK. By “really good” I mean something very random, uppercase/lowercase/numbers, and 16+ characters long. If your drive stores the plaintext password then forget it. If you use a poor password just realize that the person with your drive isn’t going to be limited to 5 tries a second or anything like that. They will copy the hashed password to their machine and attempt to crack it at full speed. There are even web services, running multiple machines, who offer to do it. So you want at least 100 or 128 bits of entropy. Reply JohnS says: October 31, 2013 at 23:22 P.S. Don’t think that a simple password, once hashed, is secure just because the hash used is a good one. Yes, trying to “undo” the hash is near impossible but that isn’t what the thief is going to do. He will probably use one of the standard cracking programs to try dictionary words, then a brute force attack. So it won’t matter how good the hash algorithm used is. When he tries “p@ssw0rd” and it matches what you used, he will get the same resulting hash and now he knows your password. Reply AR says: March 7, 2013 at 21:42 Handy article, thank you. Here’s another candidate: Kingston V200+ probably counts as ‘perhaps usable’. I’ve got one for my laptop so I have reasonable confidence that client data is safe in case of theft, loss etc; encryption enabled through ATA password mechanism. It’s apparently Sandforce based, and probably does AES-128 encryption. I don’t know the detail of the implementation though. One reference to the encryption here, http://news.softpedia.com/news/Kingston-SSDNow-V-200-and-KC100-Affected-by-Encryption-Flaw-275237.shtml and Kingston’s own page on the drive, http://www.kingston.com/en/ssd/vplus#svp200s3 Reply cpbotha says: March 9, 2013 at 12:29 Can you find any more information, for example in the manual that you got with the drive, or from tech support? The two links are very thin on information… All Sandforce conroller drives encrypt, the question is how exacly they use your ATA password. Ideally, it should be used to encrypt the randomly generated keys. I simply logged a support ticket with Intel, and after some weeks finally got a clear answer confirming this for the Intel 520. Would you be interested to try something similar for the Kingston? They need to answer YES or NO to the following questions: 1. Does the V200+ encrypt its AES keys with the ATA password? 2. Is the ATA password stored as a non-reversible hash on the firmware? Would be great to add the drive to the top list, and not the “maybe” list. 🙂 Reply Geoff says: March 8, 2013 at 21:21 Thanks again for the reply. I understand the issues surrounding encryption and compression, and see what you mean there. Encrypted files are frequently larger than their decrypted counterparts. There are also tricks for encrypting text that can’t be used on encrypted text. So, I can see how 3rd party FDD encryption could have the effect of reducing a drive’s overall capacity, and arguably their lifetimes. I’m not sold on the idea that 3rd party crypto software *necessarily* causes performance degradation, at least not when running on a processor having dedicated crypto logic. Obviously, it also depends upon the drive too, so the trick here is to use drives that are not implementing a lot of compression. Don’t get me wrong: I would prefer to use a self-encrypting drive for the reasons I originally stated — I am puzzled by the fact that the manufacturers publish NOTHING about their encryption technology; not even a user’s guide. I’m using a Samsung 830 with Bitlocker 128 bit AES. The various benchmarking tools I have used on it reveal that the drive performs almost exactly according to Samsung’s published specifications. That does not prove that Bitlocker is not a drag, but it implies that it is not a significant factor in limiting the drive’s performance. When I get around to it, I will decrypt the drive and publish before and after results. From what I see now, I will be very surprised if there is much perf. improvement once the drive is decrypted. Reply AnthonyNYC says: March 9, 2013 at 04:47 Hi Guys, I think the reason True Crypt (and BitLock also might fit in the same category)doesn’t recommend using software based encryption on SSD’s isn’t so much because of compression issues or even a speed hit, it’s more a problem for the wear leveling firmware used onboard SSD drives. The way i see it, when you write some data to an SSD the firmware spreads it around evenly on different NAND chips and tries to use them all evenly so as the name implies, the NANDS wear out evenly, thus getting the longest life possible out of the NAND chips limited write span. BUT software like TrueCrypt write random data to the entire drive so that someone can’t differential between encrypted data and empty drive space, see? As far as someone reading the drive, the entire drive is full of the same encrypted data. SSD’s would wear out very quickly with such a data handling scheme bypassing their internal data wear leveling tricks. If all the data on every bit of NAND looks exactly the same (random bits)then the internal firmware can’t do its job of balancing the data over less used empty spaces. So basically encrypting the entire SSD is like wearing out every single bit of NAND memory all at once. Totally defeating any chance of wear leveling firmware to properly extend the life of the NAND chips, and i would think extremly shortening the life of the SSD. That’s why I think the internal encryption handled by the ssd’s own firmware is ideal and secure the problem is there are hardly any motherboards with HDD password Lock capability. I wish even an add in SATA controller card would be sold with HDD Password feature enabled in the cards own BIOS which would allow SSD’s to be password locked before the motherboards BIOS even gets to detect the drives. That’s what I am hoping to find in the future. Thanks for this page, it’s helpful! Regards all, AnthonyNYC Reply cpbotha says: March 9, 2013 at 12:21 Thanks for stopping by! The effect of third party encryption on the SSD wear-leveling is certainly also an issue. I think we all agree that hardware-based FDE is to be preferred, but that we need more transparency from the SSD manufacturers, and that we need better support from the motherboard makers. As you will have seen elsewhere on this blog, the ATASX BIOS extension to a certain extent alleviates the motherboard-support problem, but it’s still not ideal. Reply Raco says: May 23, 2013 at 13:50 Actually, the best reason not to use software-based encryption on SSD’s is security: http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=trim-operation But I guess that it is still more secure than obscure hardware encryption that we know nothing about. Reply cpbotha says: May 23, 2013 at 15:51 So when did you last compile the truecrypt source code yourself? Most people just use the binaries. There’s not much difference between using the truecrypt binaries as they are made available on the website, or an “obscure hardware encryption that we know nothing about”. 🙂 Reply Raco says: May 23, 2013 at 16:33 There’s a lot of difference. TrueCrypt is not safe if: – the makers of TrueCrypt lied (ie they put a hidden backdoor in it) – the makers of TrueCrypt are bad programmers (ie some unintentional bug creates a security flaw) Your SSD is not safe if: – same conditions as above (ie hidden backdoor or unintentional bug) plus – the security model of the SSD is bad The security model of TrueCrypt is entirely known. You don’t even need to read the source to know it. The same is not true of the security model of your SSD. The manufacturer of your SSD may have decided to use strong AES-256 encryption… but with a pre-defined encryption key that is stored without encryption inside the SSD, which is just used when the user sets a HDD password in the BIOS. It is not a bug (because it’s designed to work this way), it is not a lie (because the data are actually encrypted with AES-256). It’s just a flawed design. With TrueCrypt, a flawed design would be obvious and the software would quickly get a bad reputation. If your SSD has a flawed design, then you may never know it. By the way, I don’t trust TrueCrypt, I would rather trust dm-crypt/LUKS. Reply cpbotha says: May 24, 2013 at 08:11 I agree with you that having fully open implementations would be ideal. On all my non-SSDs I run dm-crypt. However, the performance hit + security problems on SSDs are too much. In the absence of an open implementation, I’ll settle for certification (FIPS 197, etc.) and explicit and clear documentation by the drive maker. The Intel 520 comes close (FIPS197, documentation to be found, just not very obvious). This blog post is an attempt to improve the current situation somewhat. You have no choice: In the future the market is going to be flooded by SSDs, the good ones will have usable encryption. Eventually you will have to start trusting your drive maker, just like you trust now the maker of your motherboard, its bios and its firmware not to log your keystrokes, or all of your encryption keys that have to live in an unencrypted state in your network-connected computer’s RAM. 🙂 Reply Joey says: April 24, 2013 at 00:25 I took your advice to a previous comment that the two main questions which SSD drive company support teams need to answer are: 1. Does the encrypt its AES keys with the ATA password? 2. Is the ATA password stored as a non-reversible hash on the firmware? I asked this question to OCZ support in regards to their OCZ Vector 256GB device as this drive received the highest performance marks on Tom’s Hardware. Below is a copy/paste of their reply. Do you think this is sufficient to conclude the hardware level encryption was properly implemented on the OCZ Vector drive? If not, are there other questions I should direct to OCZ support? Thanks for the great and detailed blog posting!! Comment by Eric Von Stwolinski from OCZ Support. “The drive does support 256-bit AES. It is enabled by setting an ATA level password. Once a password is set the drive is completely inaccessible until the password is provided. There is no master password for the drive or any way to access the drive other than to supply the correct password once it is enabled.” Reply cpbotha says: April 24, 2013 at 11:09 I’m very happy that you took time to contact OCZ tech support! Unfortunately they somehow always manage to evade the very direct questions that we ask, which makes one wonder. He unfortunately has not answered the very simple question (I’ve improved the phrasing somewhat): “Is the AES key, that is used to encrypt the data on the drive, encrypted using the ATA password?” With previous OCZ drives, OCZ explicitly said that this was NOT the case. Having drive firmware that refuses to decrypt without the ATA password having been supplied is one thing. Encrypting the AES key WITH the ATA password is another, and is preferable. In the former case, it is STILL possible for the manufacturer to retrieve the AES key from the firmware, in the latter they need your ATA password. Do you think you could reply to his answer using my rephrased question above? I would love to add another drive to the list! Thanks again, Charl Reply Joey says: April 25, 2013 at 02:00 I copy/pasted your question and received the following reply, “It uses AES encryption, but this feature is enabled and used by setting the ATA password on the drive. If no ATA password is on the drive then the AES encryption is inactive. Only when an ATA password is applied to the drive is the AES encryption used.”. I’ve now replied back saying the following. “Unfortunately, your last response doesn’t directly answer my question. I’ll repeat and rephrase my question. Thanks for your assistance in clarifying this important point for me. Repeat: ‘Is the AES key, that is used to encrypt the data on the drive, encrypted using the ATA password?’ Rephrase: I understand that the AES encryption is only activated once the ATA password has been applied. My question is about how the ATA password is applied in relation to specifically the AES encryption key. AES encryption requires a key to encrypt and decrypt the data. The handling of this AES key is the focus of my question. Is the AES key itself encrypted using the ATA password?” What do you think? Is there a better way to rephrase the question? I hope I understand what you’re trying to have me clarify and that my rephrase gets to the core of the issue. My concern with this 2nd reply is that I thought AES encryption was always active as this is how the SSD drive easily formats/erases the data, by deleting the AES key used to encrypt the data. Apparently either I’ve misunderstood something or the response isn’t very clear/incorrect. Thanks again for your feedback and assistance! Reply Joey says: April 26, 2013 at 12:56 OCZ replied, “The ATA password is the AES key. The key for AES is enabled, disabled, or set using the ATA level password function. If an ATA password is set then AES is enabled, and the key to unlock the drive is the ATA password. This means the ATA password must be provided every time you want to access the drive or if you want to change/disable the password. Any attempt to access the drive without providing the ATA password would require getting through AES 256 bit, which isn’t possible to do with currently existing computers.” The ATA password is the AES key? Is this sufficient to add the drive to your list as properly implementing full disk encryption? Reply cpbotha says: April 27, 2013 at 14:19 You’ve done a sterling job of formulating very clearly the question. If we can believe the OCZ representative, it is starting to sound like they did it correctly. If we can take his answer literally, they’re using your ATA password (maximum length 32 characters according to the BIOS spec) directly as the AES-256 keys (256 bit = 32 bytes). I’m going to add the drive to the list, with a pointer to your comments here. Thank you very much for taking the time to get to the bottom of this. If OCZ has any official documentation further corroborating this fact, please feel free to let me know here in the comments! (I do share your doubts with regard to the fast erase by changing the AES keys. I’ll add this to the blog body.) Reply data says: April 29, 2013 at 08:29 I really don’t believe that that representative knows what he is talking about. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be possible to change the HDD password without either rewriting all of the data or permanently losing it. Reply btn says: May 5, 2014 at 18:15 Indeed! I believe that the only way that it can work is that it encrypts data all the time with preset key, probably unique for the device, but unless HDD password is set, those keys aren’t encrypted. Setting HDD password should encrypt the key. Reply Jul says: April 24, 2013 at 11:45 I came accross your website while looking for information on the M5 from Plextor, and then came accross one of their blog. Basically it seems that they use ATA password: The AES key is generated by the SSD controller. To fully secure your data, you will want to set the ATA password on the computer you are using the drive with. Access to the AES key is then not possible without the ATA password. If you don’t set the ATA password, the AES key is accessible; meaning the data on the SSD can be decrypted. Reply cpbotha says: April 24, 2013 at 11:52 I read through that comment. The Plextor representative still does not state whether the AES key is encrypted with the ATA password, and that’s a crucial point. I have just left behind a comment on that blog asking for clarification. Let’s see! Reply data says: April 24, 2013 at 12:06 Was writing just the same when you posted yours 🙂 Reply Matti H says: April 27, 2013 at 13:48 Just bought&installed Intel 520 SSD. I made the decision after reading your blog. Full-disk encryption was a critical factor for me. Thank you for taking the time to look up the specs, too bad the manufacturers do not make this information readily available! Reply cpbotha says: April 27, 2013 at 14:13 Awesome, thank you very much for stopping by to comment! Reply Joey says: May 1, 2013 at 03:45 Seems the prior comments and replies hit the limit of depth and no further replies are allowed. I asked both questions proposed cpbotha and data. My questions and the OCZ tech replies below. Let me know if there is anything else I should ask or if we know enough to be certain? Tech, Eric Von Stwolinski: “The notes about AES support are just on the product page for the Vector drive: http://ocz.com/consumer/vector-7mm-sata-3-ssd” My reply: “Hi Eric, I have two follow-up questions. I do appreciate your assistance is sorting the AES encryption on the OCZ Vector SSD! 1) The product detail page you linked is very vague only saying, “256-bit AES-compliant, ATA Security Mode Features”. Is there a more detailed public resource that provides the same level of detail you’ve provided regarding the AES encryption key and relation with the ATA password? 2) Regarding your previous comment two responses ago, “The ATA password is the AES key.” If this is true, then changing the ATA password will change the AES key, since they are the same. The current data on the OCZ Vector SSD, which was encrypted with the prior key, can’t be decrypted with the new/changed key, rending the current data unreadable? To summarize, you’re saying if the ATA password is changed, the current data on the OCZ Vector SSD is lost?” Tech, Eric Von Stwolinski: “We have no further documentation about the drive’s security features. This is only a consumer grade drive. Our enterprise grade drives have much more documentation available. If you are looking for a high security drive I strongly recommend looking into an enterprise grade drive. If you wish to destroy all information on the drive forever, that can be done using the secure erase function in the toolbox utility. This is the only way to reset and wipe the drive. A secure erased drive is not recoverable by any means.” My reply: “Hi Eric, Thanks for clarifying the documentation. I’m still not clear on my previous follow-up question. I’ll rephrase and attempt to clarify. Is it true that changing the ATA password will render the data on the drive unreadable or inaccessible? This is based on your comment that the “ATA password is the AES key”. If this is true, changing the ATA password would change the AES key. Without the previous AES key (previous ATA password) that the data was encrypted with, the drive can’t decrypted the stored data. Can you confirm that changing the ATA password makes all data, prior to the ATA password change, on the drive unreadable or inaccessible?” Tech, Eric Von Stwolinski: “Changing or removing a password will not wipe out all information on the drive. That can only be done by a secure erase using the toolbox. Forgetting a password will render the drive inaccessible and all data is lost, but merely changing or removing the password (which requires that the correct password is first supplied) will not destroy any information on the drive.” Reply Simon says: May 2, 2013 at 15:46 Hi, A very interesting read! If anyone has time please could they answer the following: I’d like to install a new Samsung 840 Pro SSD in my laptop and wondered what order I should do things in. Is the following correct? 1. Set a HDD password 2. Securely erase the SSD drive 3. Install the OS My laptop supports TPM and I’m wondering what advantages, if any this will offer to me? Thanks Simon Reply Ixion says: May 14, 2013 at 12:20 This page provides some valuable information on SED implementations on current SSD drives. However another big problem seems to me to be the support for ATA passwords within the motherboards from major brands. A lot do not support this Feature! Many people who buy the drives you describe can therefore never use the encryption function because their motherboard does not support the method to set the drive encryption. Almost all ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte etc motherboards do not support this feature. Reply cpbotha says: May 14, 2013 at 12:27 That is indeed a good point. See my other blog post on patching your BIOS for ATA security support: http://vxlabs.com/2012/11/28/adding-the-ata-security-extension-bios-to-amibios/ (atasx can be patched into many more different types of BIOSes) On my new laptop this was not possible, so I boot with a usb stick, unlock the HDD, then soft boot into it (at least until I get time to build a better solution): http://vxlabs.com/2013/03/24/acer-v3-571g-fullhd-ips-superb-priceperformance-linux-development-laptop/ Reply Raco says: May 23, 2013 at 13:39 This is not as conclusive as I’d like, but there is an implication that there’s a link between the HDD password and the encryption on the Samsung Yes, the implication is the following: choose an HDD password and the encryption system will be activated. That’s all, it does not imply at all that the encryption key is derived from the HDD password. On the product page the graphic shows quite clearly that ata passwords are related to encryption keys, but it does not specify in which way these are linked The graphic shows that there is a user password + a master password. Does it mean that the manufacturer has a master password that can bypass the user password? Reply cpbotha says: May 24, 2013 at 08:12 That drive is in the “perhaps” list for a reason. Reply Heather says: June 7, 2013 at 23:50 There are only 3 SSDs with encryption enabled beyond a simple ATA password (TCG OPAL). Certain versions of the Samsung PM830. Specific versions of the Micron (but not Crucial) C400 drive, specifically marked SED. And every Crucial/Micron M500 drive, with OPAL 2.0. If you have this drive, a UEFI BIOS, preferably TPM and Windows 8, Bitlocker can manage the OPAL directly. This is a very recent development. Reply JB says: July 9, 2013 at 08:38 Thank you so much for this thorough, thoughtful research. I wish I had found this just a few days earlier! I was so excited to get this massive and well-rated 500GB Samsung 840 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009NHAFEC/ref=ox_sc_imb_mini_detail?ie=UTF8&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER) for about $350 total. I’ve never had an SSD, and I’ve been eager to see how fast it really is. I was just looking online at the best way to transfer over my full-disk-encrypted (TrueCrypt) when I saw all the warnings about wear leveling, couldn’t find anything substantial about Samsung’s marketing about AES 256-bit encryption, and went from excited to totally disheartened when I read this article and comments. It sunk in: if I switch over to this SSD, I may never be sure that my data is truly (as you say, “usably”) secure. That’s vital to me, because my work in healthcare absolutely requires (truly secure) encryption of the information I document…. So in light of your really helpful investigation here and the 840’s subsequently questionable security status, I think I’m about to return it to Amazon and go for a smaller but verifiably secure 240GB Intel 520 (http://www.amazon.com/Intel-Series-Solid-State-Drive-2-5-Inch/dp/B006VCP90C) for about $270 total. I’ll happily give up the luxury of keeping worlds of music etc. on this drive in exchange for so much more confidence that my data is truly secure. Anyway, just reporting in, so that 1) you know how grateful I am for the good information you hunted down (and did or did not find) and 2) if there’s any new development about the Samsung 840, you can let me know on here (and maybe I can “enjoy” a second wave of regret, if you end up moving it to the “usable” category after all!!). Many thanks! Reply cpbotha says: July 9, 2013 at 09:22 I really appreciate you dropping by! The link you posted is the Samsung 840. Only the Samsung 840 Pro has exposed and usable self-encryption for about a $100 more (it’s also much faster than the 840 straight). Samsung’s own documentation is unfortunately also very vague on the matter, but one of our readers, who bought a 840 straight, has confirmed this difference. Reply JB says: July 9, 2013 at 09:48 Thanks for the reply, and so quick! So it sounds like you’re saying that the Samsung 840 Pro (I don’t mean to favor Amazon, but http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Electronics-2-5-Inch-SATA_6_0_gb-MZ-7PD512BW/dp/B009NB8WTI) is basically in the USABLE category now? Would you still say the Intel is more secure (e.g., in light of the FIPS-197 compliance)? If not, maybe I’ll spring for the big Samsung 840 Pro after all. (Tangential issue becomes the form factor: I’m on a Dell Latitude E6500, built for 9.5mm hard-drive height. These Samsung SSDs come in “ultraslim” 7mm. The 840 “straight” has versions that come with an adapter, but I’m surprised that I can’t find an 840 Pro version that comes with such an “installation kit.” Maybe there’s some other way of getting the 7mm drive to fit snug in the 9.5mm bay, or maybe not and that’s another factor for your readers to consider: usable built-in hardware-based full-disk encryption in a height that fits their setup. I dunno.) And I’m yet more amazed and thankful for your thinking this through with me/us. It’s really generous. Thank you! Reply Raco says: July 9, 2013 at 11:09 JB, I have a Samsung 840 Pro, and I don’t use hardware encryption because the amount of information provided by Samsung is ridiculous. I read that the drive requires a TPM module to activate encryption (see the comment by “Geoff” on this page). If this is true, let’s say you don’t have this module, you enable the ATA password, and you think that your data are protected, while they’re not. I think that the drive actually always encrypts its content (so the ATA secure erase is fast and does not require to write to every cell, reducing wear), but we don’t know how the encryption key is stored. Is it stored unencrypted ? Unencrypted only when no ATA password is defined? Is it defined in factory? Derived from the ATA password? If so, is the key derivation function known to be secure? Unless you have answers to those questions, you can consider that your data are not encrypted, even if they are. I don’t know about FIPS-197, but I’d be careful about it, if I were you. If I understand correctly, FIPS-197 just mean that the device uses AES, which is not enough (AES encrypted data is useless if the encryption key is stored unencrypted inside the drive). What you want is probably FIPS 140-2. The Samsung PM810 SSD is FIPS 140-2 certified. FIPS 140-2 validation goes well beyond simply testing the cryptographic algorithms—such as AES, random number generation, digital signature, and hashing—into testing the overall security strength, tamper resistance, and risk aversion within the identified secure boundary of the drive But still, I wouldn’t be surprised if a device could be FIPS 140-2 certified, but does not provide a way for the user to know if the encryption is really activated or not (what I said about the TPM module). That’s why I use software encryption (LUKS/dm-crypt). It is quite fast, and some CPUs (Intel Core i5 and above) have hardware acceleration for AES encryption. It is not FIPS certified, but I trust it more than anything that comes from Samsung, Intel, and others. Reply JB says: July 10, 2013 at 04:43 Hi Raco, Thanks for all the wisdom and trying to think this through together! I’m with you: so, so frustrating that manufacturers don’t just come out with this info more clearly. I especially appreciate your lead into FIPS 140-2 and the Samsung PM810. I found a corroborating press release from Samsung celebrating that rating and calling it a first for SSDs (http://www.samsung.com/us/news/20050). (It also seems like that same PM810 model is also known as the 470 Series.) You also bring up the possibility that a processor could be especially equipped to do AES without it dragging everything down too slow, in which case one could work around all this hardware-encryption mystery and shortcoming by just going with software, like you’re doing. But no, I can’t 🙁 My processor’s a P9500, not on this list at Intel (http://ark.intel.com/search/advanced/?s=t&AESTech=true) of AES-New Instructions processors. So looks like going with the Intel 520. Or just saying “uncle” and waiting to see if this market improves (i.e., becomes more transparent and with moresome more clearly secure hardware encryption). Anyway, just emailed Samsung too, just to see if they can give any more info. Sorry if this is like spewing too much or old news into the forum. I hope I don’t bring down the quality at all; this has been a really, really helpful thread. Thanks, JB Reply JB says: July 13, 2013 at 07:47 Hi folks. I emailed with Samsung a bit this week, asking them the questions given above about a) the precise relationship between the ATA password and the AES keys and b) where the ATA password is then stored on the firmware. Similar to the above discussion involving OCZ, I don’t think I got the direct answer I was looking for. But here’s what they said, for what it’s worth: “The 840 Pro SSDs support AES 256 full disk encryption which means that if your computer has the ability to create a password from BIOS to lock the entire drive the SSD will support it. This password is entered at the hardware level. If you set the password then move the SSD to another machine the SSD will remain locked. You will only be able to unlock the SSD if it is connected to the machine where you set the password from inside BIOS.” Also/later: “The ATA password is itself encrypted. The ATA password is non reversible but is [sic] can be erased using a secure erase.” Does this affect the verdict on Samsung 840 Pro? Are we saying usable or still unsure? Thanks, all. JB Reply Raco says: July 13, 2013 at 12:53 Thanks JB, this is interesting. Samsung said “You will only be able to unlock the SSD if it is connected to the machine where you set the password from inside BIOS“. The question is: how does the disk know that it has been installed in another computer? This may indicate that the SSD requires a TPM module. I wouldn’t be surprised if, as I said in a previous comment, the absence of the TPM module would not trigger any notification of any kind, letting the user think that the setup is secure because he entered an ATA password, while in reality only the basic ATA protection is activated. Also, even if you have a TPM module, does a failure of your motherboard mean that your data are lost forever? I’m no encryption specialist, but in my opinion, the best way to provide hardware encryption would be to accept an ATA password but to not store it, even in a non-reversible form. The disk would not really implement protection at the ATA level (which we don’t care about as the whole disk is encrypted), but it would derive an encryption key from the ATA password given by the user (with some key derivation function as PBKDF2). This encryption key would be used to encrypt another encryption key, which in turn would be used to actually encrypt the data on the SSD. That way, you can change your ATA password without re-encrypting everything on the disk. And because the ATA password is not stored in any form, it won’t be breaked (unless PBKDF2 has a flaw). SSD manufacturers don’t tell how they store the ATA password. Samsung says “non-reversible”, but non-reversible does not mean secure at all. f(password) = ‘a’ is a totally non-reversible hash function, but it is not secure at all (as any password would grant access). If the ATA password is stored in MD5, then the security of the disk is as weak as MD5, while it should be as weak as AES. Reply JB says: July 14, 2013 at 15:59 Raco, thanks for the reply. Yes, I see the connection between those earlier thoughts about TPM and this response from Samsung. I have a TPM, so maybe I would go for it—but no, especially in light of what you say, there are still too many question marks I think 🙁 So I just ordered the Intel 520. Thanks for all the guidance, folks. It’ll be interesting to see how this all plays out, if companies come out with more info on their process, if they go to the more secure processes you’re describing. I’ll keep following this thread. Again, thanks everyone for the thorough research and discussion! Reply Flo says: October 16, 2013 at 14:56 Samsung support replied to me, that a TPM is not required for the encryption of the SSD (840 EVO) to work. Only requirement is, that the Bios can pass a Password to the SSD controller. Furthermore, they said, if the Bios is using TPM for this procedure, you might have the additional protection that the drive cannot be unlocked in a different computer. Also, from what I know and researched, not every Bios is passing the Password, which the user entered in the dialoge, in the same way to the disc controller. This would also implicit problems when moving the SSD to a different machine (example: Newest Dell E6400 bios passes the User password directly to the hdd controller, but older Dell bios from different system pass the keyboard scan codes to the controller). Reply JohnS says: October 31, 2013 at 23:04 I’m curious about what happens if you use TPM and your motherboard burns up. Does this mean that there is no way to use the drive on another machine? ATA Only: Yes, the BIOS might (probably?) mess with the password before sending it to the drive. A given vendor probably uses the same approach, but no guarantee. Thus, unless you have a twin machine, you might be up the creek if the motherboard burns us. Can you say “Backups”? 🙂 Opal Only: Since the PBA stores the password, and the BIOS isn’t involved, most of the vendors tell me that the drive can be moved. Good! Notice that I said “most”. You have to check because some say “no”. Reply btn says: May 5, 2014 at 18:28 I had already some similar experience. I have set HDD password for Samsung SSD 840 Pro. Later I have updated BIOS and the password stopped to work. Hard to say why exactly. I imagine that the HDD ASE key is encrypted using HDD password that is combined of password provided in BIOS and some Motherboard/BIOS key. There was similar case somewhere on the net, and AFAIR the solution there was to restore previous BIOS, which solved the problem. Unfortunatelly on my mo-bo it was impossible to revert this concrete BIOS version to previous one. Reply HikingMike says: July 19, 2013 at 22:23 My question is with the automatic encryption on every SSD, what happens if a user or a business has a disaster and the controller doesn’t work anymore? They may not have wanted encryption, but their important data is encrypted and now lost permanently I believe (if they didn’t have a working backup). Of course everyone should have a backup, but not everyone does, and not everyone has a working one – they don’t know it until they try to use it. This seems to remove one important avenue for disaster recovery without the user’s knowledge. They were never given the choice of which was more important between protection of their data from thieves or protection from more mundane accidental loss of their data. Of course this doesn’t affect SSD makers at all so they don’t care. “Secure data” sounds good to everyone, right? Reply cpbotha says: July 20, 2013 at 11:43 If that were to happen, and the encryption keys are lost, you lose your data. This is the way it has to be. For example, trying to protect users against themselves is the unfortunate reason that the maker of my laptop built a HDD password backdoor into the BIOS, and an extremely weak backdoor at that. (I have to work-around this by booting with a Linux USB, unlocking my encrypted HDD, and then soft-booting into my real Linux, all bypassing the BIOS) The requirement for a really secure encryption solution should be considered much more seriously than users who can’t be bothered to backup their data. Put differently: How safe would you sleep knowing that even if you were to forget your password or lose your encryption keys, it would still be possible for other interested parties to read and distribute all of your private data? The only thing the SSD _should_ be blamed for, is not being completely open about the encryption, how exactly it works and what exactly the risks are to the user. With this knowledge, people would be able to make a better purchase decision, whether they want to be sure that their data is securely encrypted or rather completely open (as you suggest). Reply HikingMike says: January 6, 2015 at 17:25 If that were to happen, and the encryption keys are lost, you lose your data. This is the way it has to be. That’s incorrect. That’s only the way it has to be for people who want to use encryption, and accept the chance of data loss because of it – and keep a backup of course. How safe would you sleep knowing that even if you were to forget your password or lose your encryption keys, it would still be possible for other interested parties to read and distribute all of your private data? I actually don’t have any issue like this and I suspect it’s the same for a large majority. Someone would have to steal one of my desktop computers or my wife’s laptop from our house most likely, and they’d have to care about our data enough to do something with it. And if it was encrypted, they’d need to be able to find the backdoor way around it. It’s possible, but it’s probably more likely that I’d have a device failure than it would be to have a theft by a thief that would find our most sensitive private data (not sure what) and distribute that. I value my privacy, but I’m not really storing state secrets. It would be different, particularly on the laptop, if I did have some very sensitive data or data that’s valuable to people other than myself. I agree about being open about the encryption. Consumers should know if they are losing the possibility for data recovery by the choice of which SSD they purchased, or was included in their computer or device. Guess what though? No SSD company wants to advertise that downside. They advertise the encryption. The consumer likely doesn’t know all of the consequences. I recently had a chance to speak with members of a university physics club and the professor about flash data storage and this topic came up. They all seemed surprised that the failure of a single controller chip (and not a data chip) on an SSD could cause complete data loss without any chance at data recovery, whether the user wanted to use encryption or not. I don’t know if I agree that the security requirement needs to be taken more seriously than users that don’t backup. Now of course if you want a secure device, or you are producing a secure device, you need to do it right. But, as any company, these companies need to make money. That is the company’s requirement. It depends on who they are targeting, but I have to guess that the consumer market for data storage is the biggest market for a lot of the SSD companies, and of course also the OEM computer makers. Now if you are making most of your money with those people, and then you tailor your device so it can meet the needs of a smaller group and still work ok for the rest of the market, except for an important difference that is a detriment to the larger market, then I see that as a problem. It’s almost an insidious problem to them as well. This problem is not openly disclosed to the consumer. It is only discovered when they lose their data. These are the people most likely to not have a backup. I’m not blaming the SSD, I’m blaming the lack of communication of the risks and the lack of choice. Now, offer both options, and be open about the encryption, and I am happy with that. Reply HikingMike says: July 22, 2013 at 16:28 Well I’m definitely a person that values my privacy but I probably value having my data more. I would prefer to have an out if I need it, and this is only accessible if you have physical possession of the device. If it was a work computer and there were sensitive trade secrets on it or something, then maybe I’d be worried about that more, or the company would be. With your example of the HDD password backdoor, I agree that is a terrible idea. If a user is setting a password and encrypting their HDD, then they have an expectation that is solid protection and the manufacturer has failed there. However in the situation of SSDs, the user didn’t do this. It’s not all or nothing. They don’t have to require every single device to encrypt all data. They haven’t in the past. They choose to probably for manufacturing efficiencies and the consumer doesn’t get the choice. “How safe would you sleep knowing that even if you were to forget your password or lose your encryption keys, it would still be possible for other interested parties to read and distribute all of your private data?” I’d sleep ok because I have the device, I don’t expect it to be stolen, and I’d rather be able to get my data if the device failed and I screwed up my backup than prevent bad guys from seeing it. Reply HikingMike says: July 22, 2013 at 16:32 Actually in the last part I should have included this – I never encrypted the device. It did that automatically as default behavior. If I chose to encrypt it then I would expect that it would be protected from bad guys reading it or from myself trying to fix my mistake of not backing up properly. However that’s not the situation. I didn’t choose to encrypt it. Reply AnthonyR. says: July 22, 2013 at 19:03 Hi Mike, I think I understand your concerns here but maybe I can help in a way. Traditional Hard Drives stored data in physical locations created magnetically around the disc like a record with grooves almost. So if the drive electronics were say to go bad, theoretically the data can still be read off the disc, and most can be re-created because of it being stored like that. But the way Solid State Drives function in general, data isn’t located in any particular spot for too long because the devices electronics are constantly shuffling it all around so any particular flash cells don’t wear out before they all get used up pretty much evenly. This is what is know as wear-leveling and the SSD firmware does this internally constantly. So basically, even if the data wasn’t encrypted at all in an SSD drive, if the onboard electronics (the controller and its allocation maps) where to die on you, then having someone try and read the data off the chips somehow directly and try and reassemble bits and bytes from all over the place, scrambled and shuffled around daily so that they can try and figure out what kind of file that originally was I believe would be next o impossible to begin with. Knowing this, your fear that it is the automatic internal security that will not allow your data to be retrieved is unfounded. Your data would basically be irretrievable anyway if stored on an SSD drive if the drives onboard circuitry went bad. It’s just the nature of the new technology. At least this is what I’ve read somewhere about SSD’s in general, it could be wrong, I am not positive. Having said that, if you never set an HDD Password using your BIOS settings, then if the computers electronics die, nothing happens to your data on the SSD. You can easily connect it to any other system and read the data back. Only setting a password would require the original hardware to be present. I hope this helps and makes sense. If you think you would sleep better at night because you think you might not have backed up all your data safely then perhaps using conventional magnetic disc storage will help you? SSD’s are in general prone to complete data loss if the electronics die, at least much more prone than conventional magnetic storage media I believe. Perhaps others can also give their opinions on that. Thanks AnthonyR Reply HikingMike says: July 23, 2013 at 18:11 I believe that data recovery companies and maybe computer forensics people can recover SSDs. A quick search and look around confirms it. I do know of the wear leveling used, and I imagine that makes it much more difficult to reassemble the data, but they can do it somehow. And even if they couldn’t reassemble the data, they would be able to see the blocks of data used in wear leveling and there would be some small file data in there that might be useful to someone. Anyway, wear leveling doesn’t kill all chances. I’m sure data recovery is an expensive option but it’s an option. “Having said that, if you never set an HDD Password using your BIOS settings, then if the computers electronics die, nothing happens to your data on the SSD.” Yes. It would have been pretty bad if you couldn’t move your working SSD from one computer to another without bricking it. But what if the controller electronics on the SSD dies and you have one of those that encrypts all data no matter what? Encryption key is gone and probably even data recovery companies have no chance. Well all of this is hypothetical discussion for me personally… I sleep fine at night 🙂 I have an SSD but I only have the OS installed to it and all my storage is on a hard disk. I also have a backup. I know that’s not the case for everyone though and I wanted to point out this effect of always encrypted SSDs. Reply LS1 says: July 27, 2013 at 21:57 Great write up! I’m a little curious about the verdict on the OCZ drives though where it is stated that ““The encryption key is not directly linked to the ATA Security password (or the BIOS password).” What exactly does that mean? That OCZ has a master password that could decrypt the drive and other than that “risk” it would be just as secure as the Intel drives? Thanks in advance! Reply cpbotha says: July 28, 2013 at 08:59 It means that, by definition, the drive is able to decrypt your data without your ATA password, which means that a sufficiently skilled hardware hacker is also able to do so. 🙂 Reply LS1 says: July 28, 2013 at 15:26 Interesting…now isn’t cracking the ATA password easy with just BIOS access much like cracking the BIOS power on/setup password? If so, then anyone wouldn’t need to be a “skilled hardware hacker’ beyond that point even on the Intel drives or am I missing smth? Reply cpbotha says: July 28, 2013 at 15:31 The better drives store a non-reversible hash of the password, so it’s absolutely not straight-forward. This purpose of this post was to classify good drives and bad drives, at least cryptographically speaking. The good ones 1. store a non-reversible hash of the ATA password and 2. encrypt the AES keys with the ATA password. In short, without the information in the user’s head, the drive is nothing more than an expensive brick. Reply Raco says: July 28, 2013 at 20:43 Don’t trust the Intel drives just because the ATA password is used to encrypt the AES key. We don’t even know what algorithm they use to encrypt the AES key. We don’t know what hash function they use to store the ATA password. We know almost nothing, so we should consider that their drives are not secure. Reply LS1 says: July 28, 2013 at 20:52 Couldn’t reply to Raco’s post for some reason but if Intel drives meet FIPS requirements, doesn’t that indicate some level of compliance with security standards? If not, what would you recommend as “secure” if anything?….thx Reply Raco says: July 29, 2013 at 13:47 LS1: Intel drives comply with FIPS-197, which means they use AES to encrypt the data and that AES itself is correctly implemented. But it means nothing about the way the encryption key is made from the ATA password (I’m no specialist, so I may be wrong). FIPS 140-2 is a better certification because it does not focus only on the encryption algorithm. Some Samsung and Seagate SSDs are FIPS 140-2 certified. The manufacturer I would trust the most is Seagate. They provide more information than the other manufacturers, and some of their drives don’t use the ATA password at all (but they are complicated to use because they require special software to boot your computer with). If you want to protect your data from some random guy who may steal your laptop when you fell asleep in the subway, then most self-encrypting drives will be fine. But if you fear industrial espionage, if you want to be certain that your data won’t ever be seen by anyone, then don’t use self-encrypting drives. Use software encryption, or use software encryption over hardware encryption (may sound overkill, but it’s probably a good option is you really want strong security). Keep in mind that I’m not a cryptography specialist, though. Reply JohnS says: August 9, 2013 at 11:45 I have a pair of Samsung 840’s, not the PRO model. The other day I looked into their SED capability. Both the Samsung website (main page describing the drive, near the bottonm) and their Tech Support confirm that they are SED, using 256 bit AES. Tech Support told me that the encryption is running all the time, regardless of an ATA password or not. They also told me that the ATA password is stored in the drive as a one-way hash. They did not know what hash algorithm was used. However, Tech Support told me that they are not OPAL compliant and do not support the Secure Erase function, nor is there any way to change the factory set encryption key. OPAL compliance is on the horizon, they said. This surprised me since Samsung is often mentioned on the TCG website as an OPAL supporter, and I found a Samsung tech note for a drive produced in 2011 claiming it was OPAL compliant. Samsung Tech Support was unable to point me to any documentation on the 840 drive other than the extremely skimpy “specifications” on the website. There is no manual for it. JB: I also have a Dell laptop. Mounting the “internal” drive was easy. Just screw it in. Everything lines up just fine. Mounting the “external” drive requires a work-around since gravity pull the drive down but it needs to be up. I simply put a small piece of folded cardboard in first. This was all it took to make the drive position itself correct to plug into the socket. Securing the rear end was then no problem also. Cpbotha: I doubt that these drives are “usable” by your definition. When I entered, and later changed, the ATA password via the BIOS the data previously on the drive was still available. Thus I would conclude that the key is used for encryption and it stayed the same. Dell Tech Support was uncertain about this, but the BIOS offered an optional feature when I set up the ATA password. If offered to erase the drive if the Recovery Password was used to change the ATA password, instead of the normal method which requires that you know the old password. This seems like a good idea to me, since anyone at Dell can generate the Recovery Password at will. Apparently it is based on the machine’s Service Tag or something like it which is unique to the machine. One thing I am unclear about: How secure is the ATA password? I read one article which said that there was a program which could attac the BIOS and remove it within seconds. Is this so? Reply JohnS says: August 9, 2013 at 11:50 Correction > Thus I would conclude that the key is used for encryption and it stayed the same. Should be: Thus I would conclude that only the key, and not the ATA password, is used for encrypting the disk’s data. Reply LS1 says: August 15, 2013 at 15:40 I have also read that the BIOS passwords are easily attacked (or at least cleared) but your data on a self encrypting drive should still be secure since there’s a seperate key internally that is used to encrypt the data…at least that is my understanding of it. Reply JohnS says: August 15, 2013 at 16:14 The data on a SED drive is automatically encrypted. So if the drive is disassembled then the disk platters (or FLASH memory) contains only encrypted data. When used normally in a computer the data is automatically decrypted, also. What secures it from being accessed is the password. Think of a SED drive like a bank vault. The encryption is like the steel vault. The authentication, which allows access to the steel vault, is like the door to the vault. Having an impenetrable vault but with an open (or easily openned) door offers no real security. In an Opal drive the authentication is handled very securely with a shadow MBR which runs a pre-boot authentication routine. The data on the drive isn’t unlocked till the user has authenticated. On a SED non-Opal drive, authentication depends on an ATA password. The various BIOS’s and drive manufacturers handle ATA passwords differently. A good BIOS will pass the hash of the password, not the password itself, to the drive. From what I gather, the drive stores this sometimes (all the time?) in a non-secure area which can easily be read. If the password isn’t hashed then it’s trivial to see it. If it is hashed then you can attempt to crack it. Some BIOS’es limit the password length to 8 characters. Thus the very poor reputatiion ATA passwords have. Perhaps SED (non-Opal) drives do a better job, storing the password where it can’t be read while the drive is locked. I don’t know. I’m trying to find out how Samsung and Intel do this currently. Does anyone here know? Other than the somewhat obsolete Samsung P810 drives, the only Opal SSD drives currently shipping that I am aware of are from Micron / Crucial. The M500 is the current model. Samsung is shipping a SSD 840 EVO model which they say will be firmware upgradable to Opal sometime next month. Reply LS1 says: August 15, 2013 at 18:43 That being said should the Crucial M500 be listed under “Drives with USABLE encryption”? Reply JohnS says: August 15, 2013 at 20:21 I would think so. It is Opal 2. Indeed, any drive which is Opal, 1 or 2, should be listed, I believe. Reply JohnS says: August 17, 2013 at 02:01 I have a deeper understanding of things now. Let me revise some of my earlier posting on 8/15. > The various BIOS’s and drive manufacturers handle ATA passwords differently. This means that moving a ATA password protected drive to a new machine might not work if the new machine’s BIOS delivers a different version of the password to the SED drive than the old machine’s BIOS did. Ouch! You better hope that your motherboard doesn’t die. > A good BIOS will pass the hash of the password, not the password itself, to the drive. Although this sounds like a feature at first (it did to me!), it really doesn’t help security at all (see below) and just complicates compatibility (see above). > From what I gather, the drive stores this sometimes (all the time?) in a non-secure area which can easily be read. If the drive stores the password as given to it by the BIOS then it doesn’t matter if the BIOS hashed what the user typed in or not. Either way, what the drive uses to validate the authentication can be read from the drive. It can then (using a simple custom hardware interface) be used to unlock the drive by emulating a BIOS authentication attempt. On the other hand, if the drive does something to protect the password from the BIOS then it gets interesting. It could hash it before storing it or it could store it in some non-readable (except by the drive’s firmware) part of the drive. In the latter case, the drive would have to prevent firmware updates on an unlocked (if protected) drive, too. Given this, I see no reason to believe that the Intel 520 and 530 are “secure”. It doesn’t matter that the drive’s encryption key is protected by the user password (or whatever the BIOS sent over) if you can reproduce the user password. In other words, it doesn’t matter how thick the bank vault’s steel enclosure is if you know the lock’s combination. I have contacted Intel to find out more. I’m waiting to hear from them and from Samsung. Reply Raco says: August 15, 2013 at 16:32 “Thus I would conclude that only the key, and not the ATA password, is used for encrypting the disk’s data.” Yes, but the key is (on some drives) encrypted with another key. Which should be derived from the ATA password. This is done on purpose, to allow the user to change his password without having to re-encrypt the whole disk. When you change your ATA password, the key used to encrypt the data is re-encrypted (but does not change) with a key derived from your new password. At least, it should be done this way. According to what Samsung told you, the key used to encrypt the data is set in factory. Do they keep a record of it, along with the serial number of your drive, or is it randomly generated for each drive and even Samsung does not know it? We don’t know, so it should not be considered secure. It’s also possible that all their drives uses the same key. From what they told you, it’s not clear wether the key used to encrypt the data is stored unencrypted or not. It’s possible that if you can break the BIOS password, then you can have access to the unencrypted data. Having a separate key, as LS1 said, does not guarantee that your data are safe when the BIOS protection has been hacked. The separate key is there to add flexibility of usage, not security. Reply JohnS says: August 15, 2013 at 17:02 “Yes, but the key is (on some drives) encrypted with another key. Which should be derived from the ATA password.” On Opal drives I believe that this is part of the spec. On non-Opal SED drives all bets are off, but you would hope so. I agree with what you say about the user’s password being used to encrypt storage (not use) of the drive key. From what I read, the encryption key is generated inside the drive itself and can not be read even by the manufacturer. The drives do have individual encryption keys. Again, on non-Opal SED drives how this works is deceided by each manufacturer. I sure wish that they would publish this info! Yes, if you can authenticate with the drive (Opal or non-Opal) then you have access to the drive’s data (SED or non-encrypted drives). Leaving the door to the vault open means that the steel vault isn’t doing you any good. 🙂 Reply HikingMike says: August 15, 2013 at 22:38 From what I read, the encryption key is generated inside the drive itself and can not be read even by the manufacturer. The drives do have individual encryption keys. I thought about this as well. We’ll never know for sure as they probably hold how this works this pretty tightly. And this would be the controller chip company. They probably don’t want anything to do with the key for individual drives otherwise law enforcement would be able to ask them for it. So they have probably developed a process so that they don’t know the keys and they aren’t saved or easily retrievable, and they can always say they do it that way for best security. They don’t care whether people lose their data or if someone can hide their data from law enforcement as it doesn’t affect their business. Reply JohnS says: August 16, 2013 at 01:31 I believe that as long as customers care about good security, the manufacturers have to also. Otherwise, they will end up with no customers. I spent some more time trying to read the Opal specs. It isn’t easy! They go from just a few, very high-level lines of description to bit level detail. Key generation is done in the drive. You can also “revert” the drive back to factory defaults. In this case the key is erased and another generated. It seems that you can also Re-Encrpyt. This done on the fly, in the background, using both the old and new keys. Nice! For an Opal drive you need to purchase a management program to set up the Pre-Boot Authentication passwords and run a Pre-Boot program which they put in the Shadow MBR. This is a very secure method, unless there is a flaw in the Pre-Boot program. The programs are generally a stripped down version of Linux. Some vendors are FIPS 140-2 certified, giving you some additional confidence. I’ve seen such software sell for $40 – $100 for individual workstations. There are also enterprise management versions which would certainly be nice if you have a number of machines to manage. For non-Opal, SED drives all bets are off. You are stuck using the old ATA password mechanism, which is generally very unsecure unless the manufacturer has possibly implemented an improved version. I’m still trying to find out about this from Intel (520’s and 530’s) and Samsung (840’s and 840 Pro’s). Non-Opal SDE SSD drives will soon be moot due to the increasing appearance of Opal drives. So vote with your feet. 🙂 Reply LS1 says: August 16, 2013 at 02:05 So if one got an OPAL compliant drive such as the M500 then they would still have to buy some additional boot software to use encryption or would using Bitlocker for Windows 8 with the “eDrive” support do the same thing? Reply JohnS says: August 17, 2013 at 02:24 As I understand it, Microsoft’s eDrive requires that the drive itself be an Opal drive. I’ve read that the M500 does meet eDrive requirements. Thus the Bitlocker software would use the drive’s hardware encryption. But there are also some other requirements which your system has to meet, including running Windows 8 and using UEFI (not BIOS) to boot, for example. I believe that the Bitlocker software takes care of the Opal interface itself. Here’s a good article about it: http://www.anandtech.com/show/6891/hardware-accelerated-bitlocker-encryption-microsoft-windows-8-edrive-investigated-with-crucial-m500 Reply LS1 says: August 17, 2013 at 22:51 Thanks! I guess this means you wouldn’t need a BIOS which even supports setting an ATA Hard Disk Password as long as you met the other requirements, OPAL, UEFI, Windows 8, etc,? Reply JohnS says: August 17, 2013 at 23:06 Correct. Side note: From what I read, some (many?) UEFI boots also support the BIOS mode, for those who prefer it instead. I don’t know if UEFI supports ATA passwords or not, but an Opal drive doesn’t, so you need not worry about them. 🙂 Reply Raco says: August 16, 2013 at 02:32 “I believe that as long as customers care about good security, the manufacturers have to also. Otherwise, they will end up with no customers”. Unfortunately, customers don’t care. Even worse, reviewers don’t care. They focus mainly on speed and price. If an SSD is super-fast, it will get very positive reviews. No reviews exist that really care about the encryption system. Sometimes, the reviewer mentions that the SSD can do hardware encryption, but that’s all. So the manufacturers get good reviews in magazines, and they don’t have to try to prove that their encryption system is reliable. I talked with two reknowed reviewers on the web about this. They both told me that they are not able to evaluate an encryption system because they are not encryption specialists. I think that things won’t change until the disks get bad reviews because of their obscure encryption system. Likewise, I was not able to find critics about Opal or FIPS, which shows that people don’t care about security. It seems that no hacker tried to hack a FIPS or Opal certified device. Which is a very bad thing. If no one had tried to hack WEP, then we’d be still using it to secure our WIFI connections, and we’d still think it’s as secure as its name suggests (Wired Equivalent Pivacy). Reply JohnS says: August 17, 2013 at 02:39 How about this: Some customers care, some don’t. 🙂 Also, some reviewers care, some don’t. For example: http://www.anandtech.com/show/6891/hardware-accelerated-bitlocker-encryption-microsoft-windows-8-edrive-investigated-with-crucial-m500. This is an entire (!) review about Bitlocker on a CM500. Probably the best way to evaluate the disk’s encryption is to see if it is FIPS 140-2 certified. Check the list yourself at NIST: http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/1401val2011.htm. Note: Don’t get fooled by a manufacturer’s claim that their product was designed to meet the FIPS 140-2 standard. While a good goal, this doesn’t mean that they achieved it. No hacker has tried? They generally don’t report failed attempts, so how can you be sure? On the other hand, if the NSA tried and succeeded they might not report it either. If you are this concerned, then you probably should use two, independent forms of encryption. Perhaps TrueCrypt software encryption on an Opal (hardware encryption) drive. 🙂 Reply LS1 says: August 27, 2013 at 00:41 I was looking at http://www.anandtech.com/show/6891/hardware-accelerated-bitlocker-encryption-microsoft-windows-8-edrive-investigated-with-crucial-m500 and it mentions that you must have UEFI 2.3.1 (Class II no CSM/Class III). ANy ideas how to determine if a specific PC has that? Reply Daniel says: August 29, 2013 at 13:01 Did anybody mention the missing possibility to change the AES key which is used for the actual encryption? All stuff performed before the “encrypt(data, key)” process is useless (even not interesting) if for example Intel uses the same “key” for every SSD. Even if it is not the same, Intel could maintain a list of all S/N / keys. For real security this is not enough. I would like to set my own AES key. Reply JohnS says: October 5, 2013 at 01:52 Most SED and all OPAL drives will not let the user set or see the key used to actually encrypt the data on the disk. There is really no need, thus it would only hurt security to do so. Most will let you force the key to be changed. This effectively “erases” the data on the drive because it can no longer be unencrypted. This feature of a SED drive is sometimes called Fast Erase. It takes only a few seconds, thus saving a lot of time if you want to wipe a drive prior to discarding or reusing it. btw – Do look for drives which use a 256-bit AES key. Some older ones only used a 128-bit key, and this isn’t considered a good idea for data which needs to be protected for more than 10 years or so. An OPAL drive generates its own key. Even the drive manufacturer doesn’t know it. There is supposed to be some random seed to make sure that they aren’t the same. As for SED, but non-OPAL, drives – good luck trying to find out! At the end of the day, we have to trust the drive manufacturers to some extent. They could put a backdoor in even if it looks like it is designed and working correctly. With hardware (unlike software), it’s hard to check.

Reply NY says: August 29, 2013 at 16:04 In case anyone is interested: Some of the Asus UX-notebooks (the UX31a, in my case) contain an Adata XM11 SSD. I first contacted Adata, but they pointed me to Asus. So I contacted Asus and asked them if the AES key is encrypted with the ATA password and if this ATA password is hashed irreversably, but they refused to say anything, “to ensure the saftey [sic] of the encryption.” I tried to explain to them that secrecy is not a good thing in this case and that if they did everything the right way, then nothing is lost by explaining how they did it, but they kept refusing. Doesn’t inspire much faith in their implementation. Reply JohnS says: October 5, 2013 at 01:41 Yes! Anytime that a vendor tells you that his method is secret, then you should assume the worst. There is a much higher chance that it is inadequate and/or flawed. This has been shown in many cases over the years. Reply Robbster says: August 30, 2013 at 08:39 Great thread! Am using the ATA password approach on the 960GB M500 in a HP 2760p with a TPM module. Am digging into the details on this exact combination to understand the degree of security. There are many posts on recovering ATA passwords from specific hard drives by using software utilities that write directly to the hard drive bypassing the BIOS, and some direct hardware hacks as well, but each of these is specific to a drive manufacturer and model, and I have not yet found any describing how to recover the ATA password from any SSD nor specifically the M500. Net, while researching, I know I have a modest amount of security via the ATA password on my laptop with the M500, but will keep digging until I better understand the limitations and alternatives with this exact hardware combination. Here is a link from the Crucial forums with a bit more info on M500 encryption capability… http://forum.crucial.com/t5/Solid-State-Drives-SSD-Knowledge/An-introduction-to-the-encryption-features-of-the-M500/ta-p/128272 I’m hopeful that the ATA password MAY be more secure on this exact combination than previously, e.g.., if there is interaction with the TPM and ATA password module to secure and encrypt the ATA password such that it cannot be recovered from the drive directly. Will post what I learn. Reply JohnS says: October 5, 2013 at 01:38 Look into using your M500 in the OPAL mode, rather than the ATA mode. It will generally be much more secure this way! You will need to purchase software to handle the OPAL PBA (Pre Boot Authentication) for you, however. For a single-user, stand-alone version I’ve seen prices in the neighborhood of $40 – $110. There are also enterprise versions with centralized management, if you have many machines. Reply BT says: October 30, 2013 at 20:10 Hello, any idea about such softwares handling OPAL 2.0 SEDs on GNU/Linux? Because I’ve been trying hard to make use of M500 SSD’s hardware encryption feature on my new Clevo W540EU laptop, but in spite of digging always more into the details of hardware encryption, I haven’t found any way to leverage asuch drives on GNU/Linux. I have a custom American Megatrends BIOS that doesn’t handle disk/user ATA password (this was confirmed to me by my PC vendor) and forces “security freeze” on my drives (I have tried the “put to sleep” method with no luck). Hence I cannot go the ATA password way through hdparm, especially since I have the mSATA version of the M500 (integrated in the Clevo next to the main 1 TB HDD), making it unconvenient to hot swap the drive (the other recommended workaround for the hdparm “frozen” security problem). Contacting Crucial was of no help : they gave me vague answers, confirming I had to use third party software but without citing any but BitLocker and Wave (Windows softs). They don’t even know of a software that could make use of the PSID number printed on the SSD so as to revert it to factory state, if something ever goes wrong with the hardware encryption (they told me that in that case they prefer users to contact them for a return… So why implementing a PSID?). So, no ATA password (American Megatrends BIOS that doesn’t handle user/drive ATA password and no supported way to upgrade it with ATA Security Extension by my PC vendor), no third-party software to handle the OPAL operations on GNU/Linux, no way to unbrick the drive if something happens… Hence I’m resolved to go with software encryption (dm-crypt/LUKS), but I’m afraid this will have nefast consequences on the M500. Although according to what I’ve read, the Marvell controller should handle software-encrypted data without too much a hit on performances, and the Anandtech review says somewhere that the M500’s controller is optimized to behave well with the drive appearing as “full”, what will be the consequence of the LUKS encryption if I understood correctly. Anyway, thank you for all the info you gave about this drive, this blog post and its comments are the most exhautive ressource I could find on the web! Reply JohnS says: October 31, 2013 at 22:40 Most of the FDE vendors who support Opal use a Linux-based PBA (Pre Boot Authentication). Thus I would generally expect that they would work on a Linux system. When I asked them, however, some declined. Those who agreed that it would work pointed out that they didn’t have Linux client software, so you wouldn’t be able to manage the PBA from inside Linux. Thus you would need a Windows system to manage the PBA setup. Awkward! Good news: One vendor does support Linux (and Windows and Macs)! Check out WinMagic’s SecureDoc Standalone Windows Edition. I haven’t used it myself, but I very much like the spec’s. Also, the people there were very knowledgeable and helpful when I called. I believe they have a demo available, so you can try it out first. Note: They have qualified the M500, too! More good news: They also support the Opal PSID Revert. Many vendors don’t, which baffles me. If you decide to give it a try please let us know how it works out for you. 🙂 Reply BT says: November 2, 2013 at 13:12 Thanks for the info. I had stumbled upon WinMagic products before, but couldn’t find what I was looking for. And actually checking the system requirements for the product you mention (WinMagic’s SecureDoc Standalone Windows Edition), it doesn’t seem to support GNU/Linux OSes either… Even their server edition is tailored for Windows ones! I tried to contact them through the “Contact Sales” form, but they required me to enter a “non-free” email provider address –refusing my gmail’s one… They really are targeting corporate clients! The only product they have that seems to really support GNU/Linux OSes is their Enterprise version, with the SecureDoc OSA (installation trough a LiveCD/USB, hence no OS compatibility problem), but it’s only part of their full-featured product… Could you point me at the product you understood was really compatible with a GNU/Linux client OS? Thanks a lot! But you’re right : the fact that that FDE vendors using Linux-based PBA doesn’t support GNU/Linux clients is baffling. Not even speaking of developing a package for every distro out there, but they could go with the LiveCD/USB way! I guess the PSID revert feature is not that much popular because they promote master ATA password to circumvent a device bricking… Anyway. On the other hand I try not to rely too much on closed software, especially for security matters. But obviously as we have no OPAL-compliant libre software yet, I should get pass this and fund the development of one myself (anyone interested in a crowdfunding campaign for this?) 😉 Reply JohnS says: November 2, 2013 at 22:23 I didn’t realize that WinMagic’s Enterprise version supported all 3 (WIndows, Mac, Linux) but that the Standalone version doesn’t. Bummer. But I do see that they have Standalone versions for both Windows and Mac. Perhaps if enough people ask them for a Linux version… 🙂 Although it would be extra trouble, you could set up the Enterprise version. They charge per user and it’s about 30% more than the Standalone version. I don’t know if they have a minimum number of users for the Enterprise version, however. Or, you could probably use a Windows system to set the PBA up and do any follow maintenance but run the drive normally in a Linux system. Check with them to make sure that this is OK, but I would suspect so. This might not be a bad solution. Unfortunately, I don’t know of any other vendor who supports Linux directly at all (Standalone or Enterprise). Opal’s PSID Revert command: I think that it is important. I don’t know if the ATA commands will work on the drive after Opal has locked it. Also, then you are dependent on the BIOS and how it handles the password. Yuck! I didn’t ask all of the vendors about this, only the ones who made my first cut. Of those, about half did support it and half didn’t. Something to consider when choosing a vendor. I guess that this isn’t as much of an issue if you are using the Enterprise version, since the passwords will be backed up, securely, on the Enterprise server. Handling passwords yourself is dangerous (lots of ways they can be compromised – like deleted files not really deleting the data), so I’d be happier not having to do it. I agree with your concerns about closed vs open software with regard to security. One of the vendors wouldn’t answer my questions regarding how their PBA secured passwords on the Shadow MBR (where the PBA is located). After all, if you can manage to get the user or the drive password from the PBA then the drive encryption is useless. They told me the method was proprietary and that I would have to sign a NDA first. I declined and disqualified them on this basis. There’s a very common, very secure way of doing it (which every other vendor does!) so their doing it some “custom” way isn’t justified in my mind.

Or at least one where I could add bios extension myself? Reply Clint says: October 1, 2013 at 01:43 I’m concerned that ATA password security, no matter how well it is implemented, is not secure against an experienced attacker? I found an article that documents how to break ATA password security. They demonstrate ATA password removal using A-FF Repair Station software. On A-FF’s website, they list supported drives they can crack, including Fujitsu, WD, Toshiba, Maxtor, Seagate, and Samsung. It seems this is only for spinning drives, not SSDs. However, I’m sure the process can be adapted to SSDs, if not already by other organizations. It seems feasible if one were to analyze enough “fresh” drives and data writing patterns, that you could predict the location of the password store and forcibly overwrite it, thus circumventing the ATA security system. Is my concern legitimate? Is ATA security not reliable? Reply JohnS says: October 5, 2013 at 01:30 Yes, ATA security is sometimes not very good. As long as the drive stores the password (even if hashed) in an area that can be read before the drive is unlocked, an attacker can grab it and try to crack it. If it is hashed, and salted, and it’s a really good password, then you should be OK. Even worse, if the area can be written to then you can overwrite the password (even if hashed) with a new one which you know. Unfortunately, SED (non-OPAL) vendors such as Samsung and Intel won’t release this info to the public. So I consider their drives to be suspect. Also, you have to consider the BIOS which is handling the ATA password for you. I understand that some limit it to 8 characters, or convert all text characters to the same case. Either of these would make the password very weak. On the other hand, SED OPAL drives can have a very high level of security. The “weak link” is the PBA (Pre Boot Authentication) routine. If done correctly the overall security is very good. If not (because passwords used by the PBA are stored in such a way that they can be cracked) then you are in trouble. I’ve contacted a number of the disk encryption vendors who support OPAL drives to ask them about how this aspect of their PBA works. A few gave me the answer I was hoping to hear. A few did not. And a few just don’t seem to know! Reply LS1 says: October 5, 2013 at 14:45 Great reply! Which ones gave you the answer you were looking for? I’m looking at getting a Samsung EVO which is supposed to be OPAL complatinat with an upcoming firmware update. Reply JohnS says: October 6, 2013 at 14:24 I’m still gathering info from some of the vendors who sell FDE (Full Disk Encryption), so I can’t give you a complete answer at this time. But here is what I have so far. By the way: I don’t know of any vendor who offers support for just Opal drives (except one, but they couldn’t give me an example of even a single Opal SSD drive they worked with). Assuming that you want at least Opal 2 (including Secure Erase) compatibility and a single user (not certralized management) version, here is how the various vendors rate. These don’t qualify. Absolute Software Check Point Software Technologies CryptoMill Technologies McAfee Sophos Symantec (was GuardianEdge) Trustwave Wave Systems I don’t know. For 6 weeks I’ve been trying to get info from them. Dell (was Credant) These probably qualify but I haven’t asked about PBA security yet. Secude WinMagic These qualify. Softex So, as it stands, I’d recommend limiting yourself to one of the last 3. Give me a week or two and hopefully I’ll be able to get some more info and eliminate the middle two groups. Also, a few of the vendors told me that there was some wiggle room in the Opal spec and it caused compatibility issues with some drives. Fortunately, most have a demo period so that you can check their software with your drive before committing. Reply LS1 says: October 6, 2013 at 15:10 Thanks again. I was looking at http://www.anandtech.com/show/6891/hardware-accelerated-bitlocker-encryption-microsoft-windows-8-edrive-investigated-with-crucial-m500 and http://forum.crucial.com/t5/Solid-State-Drives-SSD-Knowledge/An-introduction-to-the-encryption-features-of-the-M500/ta-p/128272 The first article makes no mention of 3rd party software needed to handle the PBA and the second one mentions you only need such software if you don’t have Windows 8 (assuming you meet all the other requirements of course). That being said is it correct to say you don’t need any 3rd party PBA software if you have an OPAL 2.0 compliant drive, Windows 8 Professional with BitLocker, UEFI support (with a Windows 8 Professional UEFI install), and UEFI 2.3.1 (Class II no CSM/Class III) – which I still don’t know how to determine? Reply JohnS says: October 12, 2013 at 15:00 I have not worked with eDrive myself, but from what I read I believe that you are correct. If your system and drive are eDrive compatible, and you trust BitLocker, then you are all set. Reply JohnS says: October 10, 2013 at 09:13 Addendum to my previous post. I now have additional information from Dell, Secude, and WinMagic. All 3 qualify. So there are 4 to choose from, total. Reply LS1 says: October 13, 2013 at 14:14 I was also reading that BitLocker officially requires you to use a TPM chip (if you PC has it) or a USB drive each time you boot but some people have found a way to use a password to avoid all that. Makes me wonder how good that last option would be. I know you mentioned you have never used BitLocker but have you heard of reasons not to trust it so far? Thanks again! Reply JohnS says: October 14, 2013 at 02:25 I’m glad to hear that eDrive/BitLocker doesn’t always require a TPM chip. I was wondering what someone would do if their motherboard failed. Could the drive be used from another machine? I’ve heard good things about BitLocker in general. So I have no specific reasons not to trust it. On the other hand, Microsoft has produced some bad (and some good!) security systems in the past. Also, the code is not available for review – which many consider a “must” for high trust. When used in an Opal/eDrive environment, however, the drive is doing its own encryption (do you trust the drive vendor?) so the only real issue is PBA (Pre Boot Authentication). I know nothing about how Microsoft has implemented theirs. I’m guessing that it is Windows based. Almost every other FDE (Full Disk Encryption) vendor uses a Linux based PBA. Personally, I prefer Linux’s track record for security. Finally, Microsoft has been mentioned in some of the press recently for possibly cooperating, perhaps more than legally required, with the US government regarding security issues. So, if you are trying to hide something from the NSA then you might consider this, too. Of course, if you are really shooting for that high a level of security then I’m recommend using two, independent schemes: An Opal drive and TrueCrypt (for example). 🙂 Reply LS1 says: October 13, 2013 at 14:19 Here’s an example of such a way: http://rics.partners.org/show_article.php?id=274 Reply Jenson says: December 23, 2013 at 13:47 Hi JohnS, thanks for the info. It seems you did your homework! Sorry if any of these questions were there, but the formating of this blog’s comments seems corrupted and hard to read. I am I correct, that you put together four vendors who are doing standalone OPAL SW, and they are WinMagic, Softex, Secude and DELL? Did you do any more research how they works internally, did you try them? Also, am I reading correctly that you get under the NDA info from intel, how they are handling ATA-passwords? Thats quite a result! Can you just say yay or nay on the security of the mechanism? Thanks! Reply JohnS says: December 24, 2013 at 01:39 Hi Jensen. Yes, unfortunately the blog does seem to remove paragraph breaks. Ug! Yes, just those 4 PBA vendors all offered stand-alone versions. All offered enterprise versions, if memory serves. I did ask each a list of questions, but I’ve mentioned most of the security-related stuff here already I have not personally tried any of their software. Most had demos of some sort. In some cases they are available on the website for download. In other cases you have to speak to a salesperson to request it. Also, pretty much the same with manuals. Some are on the website, while others have to be requested. I didn’t discuss internals with the PBA vendors past my list of questions. All use at least AES-256. Some are FIPS 197 and/or 140 certified, but not all. Some have been providing this sort of software for years, but for others it is a new product, and some don’t support Opal at all yet. Intel SED SSD drives with ATA passwords: Yeah. 🙂 Reply LS1 says: October 3, 2013 at 13:13 In the conclusion it is stated that “Your BIOS has to support the full 32 character ATA password specification.” Where was this information obtained from? Is it 100% confirmed that a less than 32 character ATA password support WON’T enable encryption on any SED? Reply JohnS says: October 5, 2013 at 01:33 The BIOS will take what you give it, possibly mangle/adjust/change it, then give it to the drive. So the issue isn’t the ATA spec, but what your BIOS does. Good luck finding that out from your computer vendor! Reply Jan Klos says: October 8, 2013 at 00:25 I doubt it. From the SSD’s point of view, it always gets 32 bytes of data as password. It does not have any way of knowing how that data was generated and whether it represents ASCII data (if BIOS supports passphrases) or keyboard scancodes (which is what BIOSes without passphrase support / passphrases disabled usually send as password). Unless it disabled some security features if it deemed the password too short (having too many null characters), but there is absolutely no reason for the SSD’s firmware to do that. Modern SSDs ALWAYS encrypt data to be able to perform fast secure erase, they just – more often than not – do not protect the keys. I think it is their way of saying that a short HDD password consisting of keyboard scancodes (so no difference between a/A, 4/$, [{ etc.) defeats the purpose of FDE with AES256… Reply hostage says: October 22, 2013 at 06:32 According to this Samsung whitepaper, their encryption is usable by your definition. http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/minisite/SSD/global/download/Samsung_SSD_White_Paper.pdf Reply JohnS says: October 31, 2013 at 22:58 I’ve got a pair of Samsung 840’s and I’d like to know if they really are secure or not. I’ve given up trying to find out. I won’t be buying or recommending Samsung SED drives any more. I read the white paper you referenced. I don’t see any mention in it that they use the user’s password to encrypt the drive encryption key. I suspect that they do, but nothing I’ve been able to get from them says this. Also, I have not been able to get any info from Samsung about how (hashed?) and where (diag track?) they store the user’s password. Some SED vendors avoid using the diag track for this since there are lots of drive utilities which can read/write it, thus making it easy to get around it. Indeed, there are a few places which offer to do this for under $100. Instead they put the user’s password into an area which only the drive’s firmware can access. I did get this info from Intel after waiting 2 months. I can’t discuss it, however, because I had to sign a NDA first. I can say that I have no problem using or recommending their SED drives. Also, any Opal 2 drive should handle this correctly since it’s part of the spec. You have to check out how the PMA software handles it, however. From what I’ve seen, most do it right.

I wanted to use the FDE, unfortunately setting the SATA controller in RAID mode in UEFI disables the possibility to set a hard disk password. It only works in IDE or AHCI mode (and I need the controller in RAID mode for other drives). I am using windows 7 ultimate. Is there any other way to set and use the hard disk password without having to try ATASX (I’d like to avoid messing with this if possible)? Reply JohnS says: October 31, 2013 at 22:46 Check out WinMagic. They told me that they did support RAID. It would not surprise me if you had to use the same password on both drives, however. Reply Kayne says: November 2, 2013 at 01:06 JohnS, thanks a lot. Reading all of your comments, it seems like you sure did your homework! Thanks for all the information you provided. This thread is one of the only place with as much information gathered regarding SEDs! I just contacted Winmagic to ask if they support the 840 pro in RAID mode. What worries me when using such a method though, is how do you do if you need to re-install windows. I assume Securedoc installs a pre-boot auth screen to unlock the drive. Won’t the drive stay locked then? Do you have options to diable the pre-boot auth in the pre-boot menu itself for example? I forgot to ask them that actually, I only did the thinking afterwards 🙂 Reply JohnS says: November 2, 2013 at 01:22 Glad to help. I did the research for 2 clients who were interested in securing their data better. The PBA is generally installed after you have a running operating system (Windows or whatever). But it is totally stand-alone in operation. It’s not part of the operating system’s boot up, it occurs before it, and it doesn’t ever touch the contents of the operating system partition(s) in any way. Once the PBA is done, and the drive is unlocked, and then the operating system boots up. To answer your question: What if you have to reinstall Windows? No big deal. The PBA should continue to function. After you finish reinstalling Windows then you will also have to reinstall the PBA client program which is used to install/manage/monitor the PBA, should you want to. But the whole time the drive remains protected. Reply Kayne says: November 3, 2013 at 17:36 what I have trouble understanding is how can you unlock the drive to re-install an OS on it when you are installing the OS from a CD for example? Does WinMagic give you the possibility to fully unlock the drive (and thus disabling the ATA password?) Reply JohnS says: November 3, 2013 at 18:21 When you start up your computer the first thing to run is the BIOS (or UEFI). It, in turn, runs any startup code on various devices. This is when the PBA code on the Opal drive gets executed. The PBA talks to the user (or back to a network server in some enterprise setups) to get authorization for the drive. Once the PBA is satisfied it unlocks the drive. Now, to the rest of the system the drive now looks like an ordinary drive. All this happens regardless of what (if anything) is on the drive – just as long as the PBA is set up. The operating system could care less that it’s an Opal drive (excepting: An optional Opal client utility to manage the Opal drive which is just another ordinary program). Back to the boot-up sequence – Once the drive is available the BIOS checks it for an “active” partition. If it finds one, it activates it. This is when the operating system starts up. If the BIOS is set to boot off CD instead, then it will. And whatever it boots from the CD will just see a normal drive. WinMagic, and other Opal software vendors, allow you to change the locking setup. Normally this is done by using the client utility you install in the operating system. But if your operating system is misbehaving then you do need another way of doing it. Either a rescue CD or by moving the drive to a working system. Or perhaps the PBA would let you do this when it runs – I don’t know. ATA security is different than Opal, however. ATA is handled by the BIOS. You can use the F2 BIOS manager to change or remove an ATA password. I hope this helps. Reply Kayne says: November 3, 2013 at 18:27 Now I get it. Thanks! Reply Kayne says: November 6, 2013 at 23:52 Well after a few more days of research and a couple of emails exchnged with Winmagic, there just is no solution to my problem. RAID is not supported, Windows 7 is not supported, only OPAL is supported… seemed very complicated. They said they were mainly laptop oriented, not desktop. The limitations/requirements seemed to be the same ones as Bitlocker. (Windows 8.1, UEFI Secure Boot, etc) So I guess I’ll just use software FDE. From my research, Diskcryptor has great benchmarks, almost similar to non-encrypted benchmarks. I’ll just have to pay the CPU price for it. Reply JohnS says: November 7, 2013 at 00:06 Hmmm… Something doesn’t sound right. As I understand it they do support Windows 8 but don’t require it. RAID – they told me the did, but considering that almost nobody does I was surprised. Only Opal? No way. They support non-SED drives, doing their own encryption. They also support the Seagate “Drive Trust” models. If you do decide to forgo using Opal, consider ATA instead (still SED). Otherwise, TrueCrypt is free and has an excellent reputation. Reply Kayne says: November 7, 2013 at 00:23 Sorry, I meant Opal only for hardware encryption. Otherwise it defaults to software encryption. They don’t use ATA commands. Since ATA Security doesn’t work with RAID and I’ve read at lot that ATA Security was easily breakable, I’m going for software… until hardware becomes easier maybe in a a couple of years 🙂 Reply Kayne says: November 3, 2013 at 18:29 My german is a bit rusty but I found this: http://www.heise.de/ct/projekte/ATA-Security-284169.html Seems like a bootable CD/floppy allowing to send ATA commands to the drive? Can anyone better with german than me confirm this? Reply AR says: November 3, 2013 at 19:05 Not quite: The article it references describes the possibility of an attacker or malware attacking a PC by setting the password for the hard disk using ATA commands; the article you’ve found describes how to prevent this – basically by booting from a known-safe medium that disables the ability to set the hard disk password until the next reboot, and/or utilities within Windows / Linux / OS X that do the same at the earliest opportunity. So it’s an interesting article but addressing a slightly different issue to that discussed here. Relevant for any disks being used that aren’t password-protected though. Reply AR says: November 3, 2013 at 19:09 PS – A couple of further thoughts on this – (1) I’m assuming that a hard disk won’t allow a new hard disk password to be given without first having the old one supplied, but I may be wrong about that, and (2) the article is from 2005, so some more recent operating systems may in fact disable the ability to set a hard disk’s password, but I don’t know. Reply Tuco says: November 12, 2013 at 03:13 Well I have a real world test for the Intel 520 series with ATA password. My laptop has Intel 520 SSD drive with ATA password enabled. It has been in the possession of the Ohio crime lab, either BCII or Toledo Lab for almost 4 months. They are trying to access the drive data as was admitted to just last week at trial. So far it hasn’t been broken, Will keep you informed. Reply LS1 says: November 18, 2013 at 16:57 Wow! Interesting! What type of laptop was used to set the ATA password? Was it one with a BIOS that supports a full 32 character password? Reply Tuco says: November 19, 2013 at 04:55 You will understand that I am charged with two felonies by grand jury indictment at the moment. I won’t give out any details that could help the state to hang me. You may be the state for all I know, wanting to narrow your search-space.. If they break it, I will post all the details so everyone will know what didn’t work. If they don’t break it and I regain possession of it (they can motion to forfeit all evidence in Ohio) I will destroy the thing as I wouldn’t trust what they could have put on it. But in that case I wouldn’t post the details because they may have an image of it if that is possible with an SSD. Either way it will be interesting to know as I had many questions about SSD security before I bought one, now those questions are about to be answered unequivocally by the power of the state one way or the other. Reply Cliff says: December 2, 2013 at 06:34 Suppose I’m using hardware accelerated Bitlocker with Crucial’s eDrive compliant M500. (I’m not yet, but that’s the eventual plan.) At some point, I will want to re-purpose the drive (or donate or sell). How do I go about ensuring that no one else will be able to access the data on it? If using ATA password via BIOS instead of OPAL via Bitlocker, I would just perform a secure erase using something like Parted Magic. But, according to some threads I’ve been reading (e.g. New M500, Can’t Secure erase. No security set feature like other SSDs. What gives? and 2nd M500 – Win 8.1 kills ATA cmds including Secure Erase), that process doesn’t look to be possible with the M500 after having used Bitlocker (or perhaps even just having used Win 8.1). Am I overcomplicating things? If I just delete all partitions (including WinRE, System, and MSR), will that also remove the PBA and effectively prevent anyone from accessing the encrypted contents? And the recipient of the drive can then treat it as if it were a new, blank drive? Thanks! Reply Cliff says: December 2, 2013 at 06:58 More questions occur to me: Where is the PBA stored? In the System partition? If so, is there any way to recover the data protected by the PBA (e.g. the Windows partition) if something happens to the System partition (e.g. corrupted or deleted)? If I have two Bitlocker-protected M500 drives in the same system, are they both protected by the same PBA? What happens if I transplant one of the drives to another system — how would I access the transplanted drive’s data in the other system? Sorry if this is deviating too far from the original topic, but this is the only place I’ve been able to find the depth of information I’m interested in (without going to far over my head). Reply LS1 says: December 9, 2013 at 17:58 Interesting…perhaps this is issue is limited to the M500 only? Reply LS1 says: December 9, 2013 at 18:11 It would appear the the Surface Pro which uses a Micron C400 SSD might be the SED variety with OPAL support for Windows 8 Bitlocker + eDrive based on this..perhaps someone can confirm? http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpro-surfhardware/ssd-in-surface-pro-using-hardware-based-encryption/7cc9fcb0-bfb9-4fed-b925-ae75291e3de9 Reply LS1 says: December 15, 2013 at 15:10 Well I have the Surface Pro a try and it does not appear to use eDrive since it asked if I wanted to encrypt the used space or the entire drive then it ran through the encryption process which took a few minutes (based on the AnandTech article for the M500 this should not happen although I didn’t notice any performance loss even after checking with ATTO disk benchmark). Also tried a 2.5″ Samsung PM830 which is OPAL compliant and even says so on the sticker of the drive with the same results as with the Surface Pro. I thought the Samsung would be eDrive/OPAL compliant like the M500 but it doesn’t appear to be. Am I doing something wrong or perhaps the PM830 is OPAL 1.0 and the M500 and eDrive needs OPAL 2.0? On another note, the Samsung EVO firmware update to make it OPAL compliant is out now but I haven’t had a chance to try it out. Will report back when I do! Reply LS1 says: December 15, 2013 at 15:20 EDIT: Based on this http://www.wave.com/self-encrypting-drive-compatibility-list and reading the AnandTech article again it would appear you need an OPAL 2.0 compliant drive for Bitlocker + eDrive and the PM830 is not but the M500 and EVO are. Reply LS1 says: December 16, 2013 at 14:55 Reporting back on my experience with the Samsung EVO after updating the firmware to the TCG/OPAL complaint version and I was not able to use eDrive even though I believe I am meeting all the other requirements (UEFI, Windows 8, etc.). It was tested on a Lenovo K410 desktop without a TPM chip and on a Lenovo ThinkPad T430 with a TPM chip…if I can’t get it to use eDrive on a business class T430 then I don’t know what else to really try. Perhaps I’m still doing something wrong when I try to encrypt using BitLocker…I would appreciate any feedback from others who have had success with BitLocker eDrive on something other than the Crucial M500. Reply LS1 says: December 24, 2013 at 23:00 Finally got eDrive to work on the Samsung EVO but I had to install the Samsung Magician software and enable “Encrypted Drive” which instructed me to perform a secure erase and a clean install of Windows 8 which I did and it but I had to make sure the EVO was #1 on the boot order in UEFI/BIOS and also had to run “bcdboot %systemdrive%\Windows” from the Windows command prompt since I kept getting BitLocker errors saying “element not found”. After it’s done however the same problem as the Crucial M500 exists where the ATA security set is disabled and one CANNOT perform a Secure Erase on the drive and the Samsung Magician software doesn’t allow you to set “Encrypted Drive” back to “Ready to be Enabled” or “Disabled”. Reply LS1 says: December 26, 2013 at 15:49 So I spoke with Samsung about the Secure Erase and ATA commands not being available after using eDrive with Windows 8 and they told me that is part of the security features to disable ATA commands and if I want to perform a secure erase from this point forward I should run DISKPART ===> CLEAN. Ha! I don’t see how that is the same thing as a true secure erase which resets the NAND chips but Samsung claims that using DISKPART’s CLEAN command is how they reset all their drives. Reply JohnS says: December 26, 2013 at 20:46 I know next to nothing about eDrive, but it also doesn’t make sense to me that it would not allow a means of executing the Opal Secure Erase. This is a major feature of SED drives in general – the ability to securely erase an entire drive in just a few seconds. Admins love this and you see this feature hyped in many SED/Opal advertisements. Indeed, any PBA software (including eDrive) which doesn’t allow this I would consider brain-dead! The description of DiskPart’s Clean command (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc766465(v=ws.10).aspx) says nothing about it executing an Opal Secure Erase. I doubt that it removes the data in a secure fashion. Note: Using the “all” switch won’t help. The SSD generally isn’t going to overwrite the actual data location with the new data because of wear leveling algorithms. This is why non-SED SSD drives are hard to erase. Reply LS1 says: December 26, 2013 at 21:03 I completely agree. However, if you have a non-SED SSD doesn’t a secure erase command on that do the same thing as a SED SSD? (i.e. sending a higher voltage to the NAND chips and resetting them to a clear/fresh state)? One other thing I noticed in the Samsung Magician software is under “Security” it gave me three options for the EVO…the first dealt with setting an ATA hard disk password through your BIOS, then TCG/OPAL and “Encrypted Drive”. This “Encrypted Drive” option is what had to be enabled to use BitLocker’s eDrive but when TCG/OPAL was selected it said something like “Must be managed by third party software” which would almost seem like BitLocker eDrive has nothing at all to do with OPAL compliance since it had it’s own option (#3). While I’m guessing OPAL 2.0 compliance is needed for BitLocker eDrive it makes wonder if BitLocker eDrive is somehow in it’s own lower class compared to other OPAL security solutions or if a manufacturer could make a BitLocker eDrive compliant drive that was NOT OPAL compliant. Do you know of a program that can perform an OPAL secure erase? Perhaps it’s something I could try on the EVO. Reply JohnS says: December 27, 2013 at 01:28 > However, if you have a non-SED SSD doesn’t a secure erase command on that do the same thing as a SED SSD? I don’t think so. On an SED drive changing the drive encryption password and showing all the sectors as unused is all that’s needed to do a secure erase (make data non-recoverable). > (i.e. sending a higher voltage to the NAND chips and resetting them to a clear/fresh state)? You would have to do this for every block, thus taking some time. When done, the drive wouldn’t be able to read the data but possibly specialized hardware could, unless you were willing to do multiple passes with varying patterns. This is similar to what it takes to securely erase a magnetic (rotating) hard drive. > One other thing I noticed in the Samsung Magician software is under “Security” it gave me three options for the EVO … Strange! I would think that the ATA software (BIOS and perhaps TCG manager) should be able to do any ATA function needed, and that the OPAL PBA and client software should be able to switch to Opal mode and handle any functions needed. > This “Encrypted Drive” option is what had to be enabled to use BitLocker’s eDrive … To me this implies that either the Samsung drive is not totally Opal standard, Microsoft BitLocker is not totally Opal standard, or both. It sounds like reason #12 to not use BitLocker. 🙂 > Do you know of a program that can perform an OPAL secure erase? Any of the PBA vendors, but you would probably have to use their software to set up the drive and load the client program on your operating system first. Side note: Beware when installing/updating the Samsung Magician software. It sets itself up as an autostart service (look in the Start program group). I don’t see any reason to have it loaded all the time. Also, I can’t say for sure, but twice short after upgrading Magician I found that my laptop’s power profile had been switched from my customized version back to the Microsoft default. Next time I upgrade I’ll know for sure. 🙂 Reply Jenson says: December 23, 2013 at 13:17 Hi to all, At first, i would like to thank the author for bringing this subject up. I would also like to thank the people in the discussion because it is suprisingly good. I am also into HDD/SSD security and I have lost huge amount of time by studying this subject, it is frustrating that the info on this is so unclear. In my opinion only transparent is really secure, and it is clearly not this case. I wanted to buy Samsung’s 840 pro SSD with the ATA-enabled encryption. Because there are unclear rumors how the ATA password can be bypassed (but to be honest, I did not found a single one case where it has been demonstrated how [check Tuco here, even the goverment wasn’t able to do so far]) I tried to study the OPAL SSDs. It sounds great on paper, but there is IMO also the flaw in it the same way like in the ATA-passwords, and that is, the SW handlinlg OPAL seems to be not transparent. I checked vendors who do the opal SW, and usually they are providing some sort of recovery password (marketing speaking as a benefit), but if some mechanism like this exists, than other master password can exists I think. Also it seems that none of this SW can be downloaded easily without given your credentials to these companies, so not even you cannot try it easily but also it brings more questions about pairing their products with a specific customers. So, now some questions. – does anybody here tried OPAL SW for standalone user in a real world, does any reviews of this SW exists? – does any open source OPAL SW exists, that would solve all the questions – is ATA-password really that bad? Yes on non-encrypted drives before it was bypassed, but now on modern SSD’s? – does OPAL SW have master password backdoors? How the HASH in there is generated? What is the real mechanism of encrypting the SSD’s key? This from what I red is vendor-dependend, and since they are not providing this info its a blackbox anyway. So in the end, so far the core problem is to be this: If I want to do maximum for my SSD security, should I trust ATA-password or OPAL more? P.S.: one of the OPAL vendors (secude) isbased in Switzerland and they say that are not under NSA like others. How about that. Reply JohnS says: December 24, 2013 at 01:27 The ATA password on most non-SED drives can be cracked. There are a half-dozen or so companies who offer to do it for you or offer products which will. SED (except for Opal) drives are another story. Only one of these companies claimed they could, and the person I spoke with said some things which I knew to be incorrect. He finally admitted that they hadn’t done one but thought the could. The SED (non-Opal) drive vendors generally do not generally release information about how they do it, so you have to assume the worst. This includes Samsung, who refused to even let me speak to someone past the Tech Support department. Exception: On certain models, both Seagate and Intel have proprietary schemes which they both claim are secure. I didn’t look into Seagate (since they didn’t have any SED SSD’s) but I did check with Intel. After about 3 months and having signed a NDA they answered my questions. I can’t discuss the specifics but suffice it to say that I was satisfied by their response. Opal drives provide a secure means for the PBA (Pre-Boot Authentication) software vendor to safely secure the drive as long as the PBA software itself is implemented correctly. Most who I spoke with used some version of Linux. One wrote their own custom software and another used Windows. Considering the lack of any significant track record and Windows dismal security history, I personally would not consider either of these. Almost all of the PBA vendors secure the passwords in about the same way. First, please realize that there are 3 sets of passwords. First: The drive’s encryption password(s) are stored by the drive’s Opal firmware on the drive and they NEVER enter/leave the drive. Never. They are encrypted by the drive access password(s) when stored. The drive access passwords don’t need to be stored. They are only used when unlocking the drive for access and the Opal firmware can easily determine if a supplied password is any good or not. Neither the user nor the PBA software ever reads or writes the drive’s encryption passwords. NEVER. Thus if the Opal drive falls into the wrong hands, and the bad guys manage to read the raw data from the drive, including the drive’s firmware storage area, it won’t do them any good. They would still need a drive access password to be able for the drive to be able to unencrypt the drive data password, and then use it to unencrypt the data. If the bad guys try a brute-force attack (supplying all possible drive access passwords) they will be blocked by the Opal firmware’s bad password rate-limiting. So as long as the PBA software does a good job protecting the drive access passwords, your data is safe. Second: The Opal drive’s access password(s) is what the PBA (not the user!) uses to unlock the drive for user access. The actual user NEVER reads or writes this password. The PBA stores this password and supplies it to the drive after it is satisfied that the user is authenticated (however). The PBA protects the storage of the drive access password(s) in two (or possibly more) ways. First, they are stored (as is the entire PBA itself) in a special area of the drive, the Shadow MBR (Master Boot Record). The MBR is where the boot process for a drive starts. So any code there runs before anything on the drive can be accessed. An Opal drive ensures that this is so by “locking” all other areas of the drive until a satisfactory unlock command (with drive access password) is supplied. At this time the Shadow MBR is disabled in favor of the regular MBR so that the drive can boot normally. With one exception (CryptoMill Technologies), all of the PBA vendors I asked about this assured me that they did not store the drive’s access passwords in plain text (or hashed). They are stored only after being encrypted by the PBA’s user access password (the password which the user uses). So even if the bad guys have the stored copy, it won’t do them any good unless they also have the PBA user access password. Third: Again, with the same single exception, all of the PBA vendors assured me that they either did not store the PBA user access password at all or that it was stored only as a salted hash of the password. This is potentially the weak link. If a user chooses a simple password then the bad guys could brute-force it. So it’s important that the user choose a password with at least 100 bits of entropy (128 to be safer). Generally, most ASCII characters in a password have about 4 – 6 bits of entropy. Thus a 20 to 30 character password is needed. A long password is better than a “complex” (lots of types of characters) short one. There you have it. The scheme seems good to me. The weak points are the user’s PBA access password choice, a bug in the Opal drive’s firmware, and a bug in the PBA software. It makes sense to choose vendors wisely. However, if you are securing top secret stuff, or you are just paranoid, I’d generally recommend using 2, totally separate schemes, including separate passwords. An Opal drive and TrueCrpyt (full disk) software would make a nice pair. Summary: I wouldn’t trust an ATA password on a non-SED drive (of any type) at all. On an SED (but not Opal) drive, I personally would trust Intel but not Samsung SSD’s. Opal drives I would trust in general. Make sure you get Opal-2, not Opal-1, by the way. The price premium for Opal is pretty small, so I’d recommend it even if you don’t feel you need it right away but might in the future. Master and Backdoor Passwords: There are generally 2 classes of passwords: Master (for the IT department) and user. The Opal drive firmware supports both as does all of the PBA software. Generally a master password is only set up by the PBA in the case of an enterprise which has a PBA server. The storage on this server is encrypted, of course, so that only the appropriate IT people can get to these passwords. Nothing to fear here. There are no backdoor passwords that I’m aware of. However, most PBA vendors do offer some sort of a “recovery” scheme. How can they recover the user’s password? If there is an enterprise server, then it has it stored. The user calls IT and hooks his machine to the LAN and they can activate it for him. Also, most PBA vendors offer a recovery option even for the stand-alone user (no PBA server, or he’s on the road with no office LAN connection). Most of the time this depends on the user having previously set up a few (at least 3) question & answer tests. Most (but not all) PBA vendors allowed this to be disabled if you didn’t want it. If not, you could always type in 30+ character junk answers. Most (but not all) PBA vendors also allowed the user to write his own questions, in addition to the answers. This is important because such questions as “Mother’s maiden name, City you were born in, Name of your high school” can often be Google’ed. So allowing the user to set up his own questions helps. Regardless, the answers need to total 20-30 characters else the bad guys could brute-force them. Other recovery means used by some included a backup of the password on a flash drive (don’t carry it with you!), or alternate multi-factor authentication. Finally, don’t think that the NSA’s influence doesn’t extend to other countries. Other governments often cooperate with them. Foreign companies typically have financial stakes in the US. All it takes is one employee to implement something for them. So if you have something which you don’t want the NSA to be able to read, act paranoid. Use two orthogonal schemes. This also helps limit the damage should a flaw be discovered later in one of the schemes. John Reply Jenson says: January 28, 2014 at 20:02 Thank you John for your extensive reply. I understand. I have contacted three OPAL vendors and none of them replied. I contacted them directly, since I refuse to give them all my credentials for just asking if they support my setup. What a shame. Reply cpbotha says: December 24, 2013 at 22:31 Dear Jenson, John and the rest, Thank you for the super coherent and informative discussion that you are maintaining here, I’m super happy with this! 1. Today I finally had time to read more about Opal. As a security-conscious Linux user, the fact that Opal management software all seems to be Windows based (with one or two hard-to-come-by-closed-source exceptions) is quite upsetting. 2. I spent an hour or so diagnosing the strange comment formatting on this theme. I found the problem and managed to fix it: http://wordpress.org/support/topic/enabling-newlines-linebreaks-carriage-returns-in-comments?replies=1 — comment formatting now much improved (it doesn’t eat your carriage returns anymore). However, it only nests to a few levels. I’ll send some more minutes to see if that can be fixed. Keep up the good work everyone! Charl Reply cpbotha says: December 24, 2013 at 22:36 I’ve increased the maximum nesting level to 9 (it was set to 5). The theme looks like it should be able to handle it. Reply LS1 says: December 27, 2013 at 22:21 Found some more info on BitLocker’s eDrive where they mention that the drive must meet some requirements from TCG & IEEE standards but no mention of OPAL and that the drive must be an “Encrypted Hard Drive” which they say is not the same as a SED. This would seem in line with the Samsung Magician software which shows three security options for the EVO (Class 0/ATA HD Password, TCG/OPAL, and Encrypted Hard Drive). This leads me to further believe that drives that work with BitLocker eDrive are in a seperate class of their own and not the same as OPAL 2.0 drives or typical SEDs. http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh831627.aspx Reply JohnS says: December 27, 2013 at 23:29 I believe the Microsoft reference to the TCG Trusted Storage Device is just another way of saying Opal. I think that they need at least Opal 2, not Opal 1. Why they just don’t say Opal, I don’t know. Microsoft eDrive does require a few other things, however: TPM (which I understand you can work around if you try hard enough), UEFI 1.2, and IEEE 1667. Perhaps the Samsung eDrive setting turns on IEEE 1667 support. From what I read, just about all of the Opal 2 drives also have IEEE 1667 support, so this shouldn’t be an issue in general. Good luck! Let us know how it works out. Reply LS1 says: January 9, 2014 at 15:03 I’m still having problems finding an easy OPAL Secure Erase option. I was able to find this under “Crypto-Erase”/SecureDoc but cannot seem to access the linked download http://www.utexas.edu/its/help/encrypt/1838 One other thing I’ve determined is that BitLocker eDrive can only be enabled after a clean install of Windows 8 Professional & the ATA security features are disabled immediately before BitLocker even runs the system check where it requires a reboot before encrypting! It seems that if you meet all the requirements for eDrive and attempt to use it it destroys the ATA feature set even before the encryption or full reboot system test is even completed. I am trying to determine how to enable it without doing a clean install and restoring an existing Windows 8 Professional image backup from programs such as Acronis, Norton Ghost, etc on a machine that has been verfied successfully with eDrive (even without a TPM chip btw!). I’ve tried a few things including doing a clean install then only restoring the data partition and leaving the freshly installed EFI and System partiions but each time I get the BitLocker options to “Encrypt either used space or entire drive” and eDrive cannot be enabled. Doing a Windows “refresh my system” does allow eDrive to be enabled on an restored image backup but it of course removes most if not all of your third party software. It seems that reinstalling Windows either fully or partially initializes the drive to be “eDrive ready” and I’m wondering if there is a command that one can issue or do something to make it work on an existing installation or backup image without doing a refresh or clean install. Any suggesions would be greatly appreciated 🙂 Reply LS1 says: January 9, 2014 at 19:44 Looks like in order to make it work with an existing installation one has to use the Microsoft Standard SATA AHCI Controller and not the Intel one…I had to remove the Intel one and go into safe mode in order to get it working right and eDrive can be enabled. Apparently after BitLocker eDrive is enabled one CANNOT update the standard SATA controller driver to the Intel one or Windows won’t even boot. Got this idea from a forum on Crucial’s site where a user had the same issue with the Crucial M500. Reminds me of some problems people had with the OCZ 3 series SSDs where they had to use the standard controller to prevent BSODs in Windows. Now to figure how out to perform an OPAL Secure Erase on this EVO drive. Reply Cliff says: January 21, 2014 at 17:21 So, just to confirm, you *WERE* able to use Intel drivers on a fresh install, correct? If so, any idea whether the Intel drivers can be updated henceforth? Also, if I have no interest in using the various Intel features (Rapid Response, Rapid Start, Smart Connect), is there any disadvantage to using the Microsoft drivers? Reply LS1 says: August 5, 2014 at 15:06 Yes, IIRC that worked just fine using the Intel drivers that are installed by default. I never tried updating the drivers but I suppose it can always cause issues. I can’t think of any major disadvantage to using the Microsoft drivers…but perhaps performance might suffer to a point where one could measure it, but likely never notice it? Reply tomek says: January 13, 2014 at 14:11 I’m aware this article is a bit old, but maybe you would like to ask Kingston if they correctly implemented encryption in they products (specifically i’m interested in mS200 series) and update it. Reply OZA says: January 17, 2014 at 19:43 Here is my dialogue with Samsung UK. Only took them 12 hours to respond and the response seems very clear to me. Hope this helps. — I have the 840 pro SSD. I am aware the the encryption option can be set via an ATA password in BIOS even WITHOUT TPM. However, I have a TPM motherboard with a TPM chip, my question is: will the SSD utilise the TPM chip to increase the encryption security? If the answer is ””yes””, my further question is: if I somehow damage/lose the TPM chip/motherboard, will the SSD be completely useless or will I be able to use it (I acknowledge that the data would be lost but that is a different matter). — thank you for your email. The SSD can use the TPM to increase the security, but if something goes wrong on the TPM the SSD will be useless because you won’t be able to run anything onto the SSD, not even the secure erase or the format. Anyway, if the SSD is still in warranty, you will be able to send the SSD to the Samsung repair center asking for a RMA number and it will be repaired. Reply Jenson says: January 28, 2014 at 20:05 I would really be curious HOW the TPM can enhance 840’s security on a pre-boot level. Don’t they talk about SW encryption? Reply Jenson says: January 28, 2014 at 20:27 Interesting related read: http://www.ivizsecurity.com/research/preboot/preboot_whitepaper.pdf Reply JohnS says: January 28, 2014 at 23:59 I only scanned the preboot article quickly, but I would suspect that it doesn’t apply to most Opal drives because Linux is used for the PBA by most Opal utilities. It is no longer accessible once the PBA completes, and the boot to the OS takes place. Also, the attacker would need access to a booted system. If he has this access, then he already has access to the unencrypted drive data. Reply Pro says: February 13, 2014 at 12:18 I read this article, most comments and many other related articles on SED. I still have questions: 1) When using a SED drive such as the Samsung 840 Evo/Pro with Truecrypt as full system drive encryption, is this encryption hardware assisted (so faster than what it would be using the same setup but with a NON SED disk)? 2) If so, are you still as secure as you would be on normal hard disk (non SSD)? Truecrypt mentions that when using SSD with TRIM (most modern SSD’s) things are not so safe.. 3) The only way to take FULL advnatage of the hardware accellartion of SED’s and to be as secure as possible is to have the damned ATA password in the BIOS? In that case you don’t need Truecrypt or any other software right? 4) What happens if you use the ATA password with a SED-SSD and motherboard breaks down? I suppose you lose all the data but can you take the SSD on a different pc and format it? Thanks Reply JohnS says: February 14, 2014 at 19:28 1) I’m not 100% sure, but I believe that Truecrypt does not use encryption done by the drive itself. 2) When doing software encryption on a SSD then TRIM (and a few other things) are issues. I’d opt to use the drive’s encryption since it avoids these issues. 3) Some self-encrypting SSD drives handle ATA passwords well. Intel does, for example. I tried to find out about Samsung but was unable to get the necessary info. 4) If the motherboard breaks, then you are in trouble. An ATA password gets “massaged” by the BIOS, so you have to find another machine with the same BIOS. Tacky! I’d depend on my backups instead. Consider an Opal drive (with support software) instead of using an ATA password. You can probably move the Opal drive to another machine if you need to (but check with the Opal software vendor!). Reply Pro says: February 15, 2014 at 09:42 Thanks John, you re-confirm what I already thought. So conclusions: 1) All modern SSD’s shouldn’t be used with TrueCrypt. 2) The whole SED thing is sort of useless for use on most desktop systems as they don’t support ATA passwords (and on most laptops too). 3) Even if you have an ATA password and an SED, you are tied on the speciifc motherboard you have. Again, this makes SED use practically useless, as motherboards can fail, or you might wanna simply move the drive to a new PC or laptop, which means you have to always keep backups (which will not be SED secured, so u will have to secure them using software again..). 4) OPAL drives are equally useless, my Samsung 840 Evo is OPAL, but again needs an ATA password, OR a clear format and then installation of Windows 8 only with Bitlocker (so again, not hardware only secure). What is the point of all of this then??? Luckily I didn’t buy my SSD cause it was SED/OPAL but just because it was a good fast and reliable SSD.. Reply JohnS says: February 17, 2014 at 07:54 Hi Pro. I think that your conclusions are somewhat pessimistic. SSD’s are a recent technology so you expect some “bleeding edge” effects. If you are tryping to protect your drive data with encryption (a good idea!) then using a SSD (vs a hard drive) does add some complications. SED’s eliminate the SSD complications and help with the encryption itself. I consider this a “plus”. Yes, it would be nice if TrueCrypt took advantage of the SED drive encryption. Some encryption software does currently (BitLocker does, in some cases) and I expect that the percentage will increase with time. But it is a chicken-or-egg thing, and you have to start somewhere. 🙂 It seems that ATA password implementation on drives is generally better on SSD drives than hard drives. And Opal drives are better yet. It is unfortunate that more desktops don’t support ATA. I guess that theft is more of a concern to laptop owners. But with all the recent attention to encryption in general, perhaps the desktop vendors will add it. it wouldn’t hurt to contact your vendor and make such a request. I wouldn’t worry too much about not being able to move an encrypted drive to a new machine. This should be an uncommon event. When it does happen, restore from a backup. You need to make backups anyway (in case the drive is stolen) so it’s no big deal, just an inconvenience. I don’t see why your Opal drive would require an ATA password. In general, an Opal drive doesn’t. Summary: Bleeding edge right now, but forecast looks better. Reply David Gusquet says: February 18, 2014 at 19:41 Hi, I’m able to activate (and deactivate) the ATA password on my Samsung SSD using hdparm, but my BIOS doesn’t ask for the password, it acts all crazy instead (Asus motherboard). I’m now wondering if there’s a way to automate the boot-up procedure: – boot into some Linux (command line only) on a USB flash drive – unlock the drive (a script that asks for the password and runs hdparm) – reboot into main OS (Windows in my case) Ideally, the only interaction during the whole process would be to enter the password and hit enter. As I am by no means a Linux expert, I’m hoping that someone could give some tips as to how rebooting is handled and what Linux flavor is preferred. Thanks for this blog post, I’ve learned quite a lot! Reply denny says: March 14, 2014 at 00:46 So, I made a bash script that starts on Ubuntu server whenever the main drive is locked. Here it is: Then just openvt -s -w bash /pathto/unlock.sh in rc.local My bios tries to boot the locked drive first and then falls back on Ubuntu server when that fails. The bash script starts in a virtual terminal before login, authenticates the user and does a warm reboot. It works really nicely but I’m not sure how good this is in a security point of view. Perhaps someone here can tell me what downsides there are? Is there some way the password can be logged when doing it this way? Is there a better distro than Ubuntu server which I’m using? Some feedback is always nice! I thought I could use my old Intel G2 to host this on a small partition. Reply diego says: March 22, 2014 at 13:26 I bought a Samsung 840 Evo SSD and have a Dell XPS 15 laptop. Is it possible to set the SSD ATA password with a third party software like hdat2 or hdparm? I’m worried about the way Dell BIOS sets the password, as described here: http://thaeial.blogspot.com.br/2013/01/locking-and-unlocking-hdd-with-dell.html. Reply r0m30 says: April 4, 2014 at 20:45 There doesn’t seem to be much on the net about SEDs at the consumer level. Looking into it, it doesn’t look like it will be that hard to code a piece of basic management software. One thing I see in here is your concern about what is actually stored on the drive for a password. Can I ask why? If someone has the ability to read the protected part of the drive they will also have the ability to return whatever is stored in the PIN field of the SID without trying to figure out how it was derived. What would you like to see stored in the authorization table? An arbitrary piece of a hash of the password, the MD5 sum of the hash of the password … ??? I’d be interested in hearing your input on this, I’m not heavy into the security, I nod off well before they start talking about elliptic curve domains. I’m also wondering how long it will be before a piece of malicious code starts floating around that takes ownership of OPAL drives that are still in the manufactured state and locks the user out? A “we haz crypted ur data, wanna buy a key” type of ransom-ware would be easy to wrap inside a virus/trojan. Reply r0m30 says: April 21, 2014 at 02:25 Not sure if anyone is still following this thread but I just wanted to let you know that I released the first part of a GPL Opal implementation. This release only contains the host management software. The reason for releasing this without a PBA is to enable people to PSID Revert their drives if they need to.

Simply enabling the ATA password via the BIOS will automatically render all data on the drive unintelligible without the proper password. Because it is implemented at the hardware level, there is no performance penalty like there is with a software-based FDE implementation. This feature is a valuable privacy tool for anyone who uses a portable computing device (e.g., laptop), especially frequent travelers.” See http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/minisite/SSD/global/html/about/whitepaper06.html Reply JohnS says: May 22, 2014 at 21:03 Unfortunately Samsung refuses to say how and where they store the password on the drive. Traditional (non SED) drives with ATA passwords are often easy to crack. So without this information, the security of the Samsung drives is questionable. Reply Jayme Snyder says: September 22, 2015 at 23:42 Why does the password need to be stored on the drive? It can be like a password protected RSA private key or use PKCS#8. A password has to be supplied as part of the computation to decrypt the actual AES key used to encrypt the disk valid. When a password is supplied, the resulting key can be used to confirm that when a logical block is read, the expected value is returned – ie. read hidden sectors outside of the ATA addressable LBAs and confirm that they return a known value like deadbeef If yes, the correct password is was provided and assume that the same algorithm used on 32 bytes of other hidden sector range is now the valid AES key to encrypt/decrypt the disk… if no, try password again until unlock retries exceeded – wipe the area of the disk with the encrypted AES key or halt disk until power reset. Let the user use software to provision the initial keys or at least supply random data to the drive firmware for key generation. The first key and it’s password can be changed any time after the disk is encrypted and you make millions of dollars selling SED drives. The weak side here or with any encryption scheme is how can you ever tell if the drives firmware has been tampered with… Even if it left the factory with working FDE, it’s kind of hard to verify that it’s still got a secure implementation weeks later… and you can’t exactly ask “hey firmware, have you gone evil? tell me what you look like to prove it!” At least with open source software FDE schemes you can compare the software with other software, before the other software doing the work is loaded, to see if it has changed… But then again it may be harder to get access to the memory of the hard disk controller then the memory of the system to recover keys… or maybe not http://spritesmods.com/?art=hddhack&page=3 So maybe if you are truly paranoid, you will use both… Reply John Souvestre says: October 21, 2015 at 01:25 You present some interesting possibilities, but the problem is that Samsung refused to say how they did it. So there is no information to base a decision on. Considering that almost all other manufacturers I checked with did provide info supporting their claims of using secure methods, one is left wondering why Samsung is reluctant to say anything about their method. A prudent person has to therefore assume the worst case. Reply Ming says: May 23, 2014 at 23:34 What about Crucial’s M500 SSDs? After hours of searching on the Internet, I came across this answer from Community Moderator, Crucial_YogiH in their forums. Does it mean that the M500 meets the requirements to be added to this list? “Yes, the M500 does support the ATA command set, formally known as the ATA Security Feature Command Set. If you choose to use this, the drive gets locked by a BIOS password.” http://forum.crucial.com/t5/Solid-State-Drives-SSD/Crucial-M500-ATA-Password-and-Disk-Encryption/td-p/146088 On a side note. If I have enabled the ATA password on the M500 (or any drive), then my laptop dies, can I put the drive in an external eSATA enclosure and supply the password to access the data? Can’t find this information anywhere on the Internet. (I understand USB enclosures probably don’t work as they don’t support the required ATA commands.) Reply r0m30 says: May 25, 2014 at 02:00 @Ming, Re: your side note. As is often the case, “it depends”. If you know how the bios manipulates the password you enter before sending it to the drive then yes you could use something like hdparm to unlock the drive and recover the data. Unfortunately most (all?) bios vendors do not document this so in the vast majority of cases the answer will be no. The bios could use the ascii characters you enter as the password, or it could use the keyboard scan codes as the password, it could also pad the password (often with hex 00). The bios could also perform some type a hashing on the entered password before sending it to the drive. Without documentation it is unlikely you will stumble across the correct password. Your best bet for recovery is backup the data often then back it up again. Reply iancu says: September 16, 2014 at 19:25 does anyone know if it’s possible to use hdparm to activate the ATA security that the user is required to enter a password at bios, to use hd parm to set the passwords user and master? is it possible to do this with hdparm commands on the majority of laptops/desktops or do you really have to know exactly how the bios manipulates the user password you set with hdparm? secondly does anyone know why adding this layer of security is such a pain in the ass? there has to be a reason or all vendors would happily advertise it and charge as much as possible for it. Reply Al Winston says: January 4, 2015 at 19:47 You may want to amend this article a bit to include a list of motherboards with UEFI BIOS that support ATA passwords. It seems that despite the ubiquity of SSDs that support the fast, simple and reliable hardware encryption (Samsung 840/850 EVO and Intel 300,500, 700 series), ASRock and others do not have the ability to set an ATA password in their BIOS. Further, this particular feature in a motherboard is never advertised nor is it brought up as a feature in review articles that compare motherboards. And before I get these comments on how “ATA Passwords are not secure”, please read this first: https://www1.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/filepool/projects/sed/seds-at-risks.pdf If you just turn off your machine, a hardware encrypted SSD is near, if not completely, uncrackable. And to see just how lame the reasoning is for not providing the ATA Password feature in BIOS is: http://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/Introduction-to-Self-Encrypting-Drives-SED-557/ In other words, this feature is not implemented because it works well. What the . . ? ASRock, would you PLEASE implement this functionality in your UEFI BIOS!! Reply HikingMike says: January 6, 2015 at 16:56 “And to see just how lame the reasoning is for not providing the ATA Password feature in BIOS is: http://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/Introduction-to-Self-Encrypting-Drives-SED-557/“ “So rather than risk having an angry customer that accidentally locked their drives, they leave that specific feature of SEDs disabled.” It sounds like they see the costs as not being worth it. They don’t see saving money and customer satisfaction as lame. They could offer two options. That way people that want the encryption and associated risks can have it done right, and the rest don’t have the risks slid in behind them. Reply Al Winston says: January 6, 2015 at 18:06 I can see both sides, but it sways toward having the BIOS ATA Password option. There will be the occasional customer who screws up the password situation. On the other hand, there are millions of customers using Samsung and Intel SSDs who would like this feature. The cost to amend the BIOS is minimal, the potential business opportunity is huge. So ASRock’s tech team responded to my request and gave me their BIOS with the ATA Password option. But they didn’t post it on their BIOS update website. Hence they have the option for it, as you suggested HikingMike. It would be great if this option were both advertised so people know it’s available (perhaps with a small hurdle so they understand the risks) and if more motherboard manufacturers even offered it. Kudos to ASRock for having it available, at least. Reply pro says: January 6, 2015 at 20:44 making a non encrypted backup defeats the whole purpose of encryption.. Could you make a clone that IS encrypted? With TrueCrypt I’m sure you can.. Reply HikingMike says: January 6, 2015 at 21:23 making a non encrypted backup defeats the whole purpose of encryption.. Could you make a clone that IS encrypted? With TrueCrypt I’m sure you can.. Not necessarily. I’m guessing you’re replying to Al Winston’s idea below. His idea is pretty simple. If you access your non-encrypted backup device very rarely and normally keep it in a different location (a locked safe even), then that can be a valid strategy for a user. They may carry their laptop around everywhere, leave it in a public place by accident, or have it stolen, but the other backup device doesn’t have the same exposure so that makes sense to me. It definitely does not defeat the whole purpose. You can make a clone that is encrypted by just using another encrypted drive in the same computer (that may only be usable if it’s in the same computer), or by using TrueCrypt like you say so you can actually access it with any computer that has TrueCrypt. Mentioning TrueCrypt, you have to bring up the situation that software is in that causes some people to no longer trust its encryption solution. However it is currently undergoing an independent security audit, Phase I is complete (looks pretty good). Whether or not you trust the auditors is another thing 🙂 Reply Al Winston says: January 7, 2015 at 18:31 Well, there’s still debate on whether Truecrypt increases wear on SSDs, although I do not claim to know about this. It fills the entire SSD, so things like overprovisioning no longer increase the life of the drive, supposedly. Also, since Truecrypt is no longer supported or being developed, there’s that concern as well. It just seems easier and simpler to go the hardware encryption route. Reply HikingMike says: January 7, 2015 at 22:35 No reason the backup drive needs to be an SSD if wear is a concern. I’d guess it’s not a concern for most though. Only the SSD itself can access the overprovisioned space. Reply John Souvestre says: January 7, 2015 at 07:55 Better yet, back up to a SED drive. Then you don’t have to worry about exposing the data if the backup drive is stolen. Reply Al Winston says: January 6, 2015 at 02:06 OK, I’ve got some news here. Because I want to make sure this is found by people wanting an ATA Password, I’m going to throw in buzzwords like ASRock Extreme6 Z97 motherboard, Samsung 840 EVO SSD with AES encryption (or Class 0 as they call it in Driver Magician), the Intel 320 and 520 and 530 systems with AES hardware encryption. There. Now, I received an email today from somewhere in Asia where they write the BIOS for ASRocks UEFI BIOS. They said they wrote “me” a new BIOS, but I’m going to suspect that they had it but didn’t release it because they were afraid people would lock themselves out of their drives. The bottom line is, there is an ASRock UEFI BIOS 1.07B, an addition to the 1.07 BIOS. This B version has ATA Password capability for each drive in your system. Now, I’ve not tested how many characters, nor have I looked to see if it can do hash marks, or symbols or caps vs lowercase. What I have tested is encrypting it with the ATA password on my ASRock machine and then putting the SSD into another machine . . . it would either not be recognized or completely unreadable, even by some forensic software I’ve got. This was true for a Samsung 840 EVO 1tb and for an Intel 520 480gb. Sooo, if you have an ASRock motherboard, you’re in luck. I hope I don’t cause any trouble by providing the email address of the technical support team that sent me the BIOS: Asrock_TSD@asrock.com.tw For all those with Samsung 840/850 EVO and Intel SSDs, if you buy an ASRock motherboard, you can do hardware encryption with all the advantages noted above. HOWEVER: based on what I’ve read, if you power off the machine and then forget your ATA Password . . . no one can help you. Not Samsung, Intel, ASRock or the NSA. Unless somehow you can brute force it. Reply Al Winston says: January 6, 2015 at 18:16 So that others who encounter this excellent thread can understand, an encrypted SSD can be backed up/cloned to a nonencrypted drive as backup. The nonencrypted drive can then be stored/secured offsite or away from the computer. This would then address both security and the concerns about a single chip failure in the SSD preventing drive access. Reply pro says: January 10, 2015 at 08:34 A few thoughts here: 1) This thread is excellent indeed. 2) Call me paranoid, but if I have data that is encrypted, it means I consider it too important to encrypt it in the first place. To me, making a non encrypted backup of stuff that I did bother encrypting still makes no sense, even in a safe. That’s just me though. On The other hand, I don’t encrypt the whole drive (with the exception of my work’s computer which is at work, which other people like the admin, the cleaners, or basically whoever (our building is very very low security) have physical access too..). Do I care if my hdd at work fails? Nope, cause the files that are important to me, I have also on an encrypted USB.. 3) As far as TC is concerned, I know it’s not supported anymore, but I don’t care, I choose to trust it, it has never been proven to be cracked in the past. As far as I know, Microsoft bought out the creators, just so that it can monopolize it’s own encryption software. If I was the creator of TC and MS paid me a couple of million or whatever, I’d say whatever they wanted me to say too!!! 4) I just contacted ASUS for the possibility for a beat bios with ATA password for my main PC, and they said it’s not happening,. shame that most manufacturers don’t support ATA pass for desktops.. Reply Al Winston says: January 10, 2015 at 15:26 Pro shows that there’s a lot more than one way to do this. I’d go with hardware AES encryption for my SSD, because it’s fast, which is why I’m using an SSD. For a regular hard drive, TrueCrypt is probably better, although I am going to claim ignorance ’cause I’m not sure. Hard drives don’t have the hardware encryption of the EVO or Intel SSDs, I don’t think. Anyway, locking stuff up in a safe is pretty reliable (as is storage off-site), but ultimately security can be breached. Sony. Need anyone say more? What’s best is what makes the user the most comfortable, and all options should be available. Hence my annoyance with ASUS and Gigabyte and such who won’t give BIOS with this feature. I’m still somewhat stunned at how quickly ASRock turned around and gave me the updated password. I also am stunned at their most recent email: They KNOW about this feature and they knowingly are NOT posting it on their board out of concern that newbies would lock themselves out of their drives with no recourse. The same reason ASUS gave for not doing it at all. Reply HikingMike says: January 10, 2015 at 21:04 Interesting thoughts in last 2 comments, and shows what different viewpoints people can have. Also about TrueCrypt, yeah I don’t have a problem trusting it myself personally. The situation is strange (still not sure what happened), but I’m sure it still works fine, and definitely good enough for me. And for #2 by pro… that’s a good point. I cannot imagine how terrible I would feel if I had such important data that I’d encrypt it and then the chance that I could forget the password or something and lose it forever. Anyway, making backups is light years higher on the list than encrypting for me personally but lots of people here put it higher than I do obviously. For work, that can certainly be another issue. I’ll end by saying that security is really not an absolute thing. Yes, information security is hard. This probably applies to network security most of all but I’ll include data storage. There are different strategies, different pros and cons and trade-offs, and there is a whole spectrum of how secure something can be. The general public are beginning to realize this more as the news items continue to build up. Reply r0m30 says: January 11, 2015 at 03:26 Just want to correct Al’s statement on hard drives not having hardware encryption. While currently most do not there are some on the market, the ST500LT025 (OPAL 2.0) is one I know for sure does, Seagate also makes some “cloud” drives that are OPAL Enterprise and Toshiba makes some OPAL 2.0 drives as well but I haven’t tested any of those so can’t comment further. I would expect to see more come to market as eDrive is now “standard” as of Win 8.1. Before I stir up a hornets nest, I am *NOT* promoting eDrive. I think it is criminal that to have eDrive fully implemented for non-domain (essentially non-business) users you have to give M$ an administrator account on the machine. Reply r0m30 says: January 29, 2015 at 09:25 Hello all, Just wanted to let everyone know that I have released a version of msed that supports OPAL compliant drives. msed will allow you to enable the TCG/OPAL encryption without the need for any additional bios support. The just released version (0.20beta) only has a PBA for BIOS computers (no UEFI support yet). There is currently no support for sleep (s3) but hibernation does work. The program is open source. Source code is available on github at http://www.github.com/r0m30/msed (host management utility) and http://www.github.com/r0m30/syslinux (PBA). Executables and a prebuilt PBA are available at http://www.r0m30.com/msed/files. This is still early lifecycle code but I’m using it on my primary machine so bugs should be fixed pretty quickly. Documentation is being developed now but there are some quick and dirty instructions for getting it running at http://www.r0m30.com/msed/project-updates Reply cpbotha says: February 6, 2015 at 07:20 r0m30, I’m super happy that you wrote msed, thank you very much!! Up to now I’ve been using Intel 520s, but I’m currently waiting for a new workstation with a Samsung 850 PRO SSD, which looks like it’s OPAL compliant, in it. If I manage to get your tool working, I’ll probably write another post here, and/or amend this one. Reply r0m30 says: February 7, 2015 at 01:21 @cpbotha Hope it works well for you. If you have any problems please open an issue at https://github.com/r0m30/msed/issues I have an 850 EVO (non-pro) and that drive is OPAL compliant and works with msed. msed has also been tested on the 840 EVO as well. Reply cpbotha says: February 11, 2015 at 21:58 Hi there r0m30! I was able to build, configure and install your msed and PBA image on my new Samsung 850 PRO. I wrote up everything in this post: http://vxlabs.com/2015/02/11/use-the-hardware-based-full-disk-encryption-your-tcg-opal-ssd-with-msed/ Thank you very much for this fantastic utility! (please let me know in the comments to the other posts if you’d like anything changed) I’m also quite curious if you know how exactly Samsung treats the hash your tool passes to it. To they use it to encrypt / decrypt the actual drive encryption keys (that would be great, and would count as “usable”) or is the hash simply compared to a stored one, but not actually used to encrypt the drive encryption keys (“unusuble”). Thanks again, Charl Reply r0m30 says: February 12, 2015 at 03:05 Hi Charl, Thanks for trying msed and posting on your experience. I don’t “know” but I doubt that ANY OPAL drive encrypts the DEK with the AK. OPAL is designed to be a multi-user solution. It is possible to give multiple users the ability to unlock a Locking Range. You could give user1, user2 and user3 the ability to unlock the Global Locking range (the OS and swap partitions) and then give each of them the ability to only unlock one user unique Locking Range that controls the portion of the drive that has a partition with their home directory. Whose key would you use to encrypt the Global Locking Range DEK (or more accurately the Range Encryption Key)? With the ability to define multiple users and multiple locking ranges it would be quite difficult to encrypt a DEK (REK) with a single users AK. Reply Mosquito337 says: February 3, 2015 at 14:00 Do you need to install this “ATA security extension Bios” only to set the password or do you also need it to enter the password later at startup? If only needed for password setting, then why not plug the SSD to a notebook with a bios supporting 32 characters ATA password. Then unplug the SSD and put it in your desktop. Even if the desktop mainboard would not have any feature to set or modify an ATA security password, the password (hash) is already “in” the SSD, because it was placed there as shown above. When the machine now boots, the SSD should provide the short boot up routine to enter the password for its unlocking. This is how I understand the “TCP OPAL” specification – that the SSD runs a boot routine to enter the pw for itself. So what is your experience? Do you still need the mainboards’ BIOS in order to enter the pw and send it to the SSD or does the SSD manage the pw entry on its own after it has been set once? Cheers, Mosquito337 Reply Mosquito337 says: February 3, 2015 at 16:00 Ok, after reading almost all posts here, I think to answer my questions myself: 1. For ATA security password you need the Bios for both, setting the pw + entering it all the times needed for boot. If you change the drive to another machine with another mainboard/ BIOS version/ type, it is likely the transfer of the ATA pw will be handled differently so that you cannot access your data anymore. You would likely need the same mainboard + BIOS version as when the ATA pw was set. Further, there is intransparency in many cases by the manufacturers as how the AES encryption key is generated or protected by hashing the ATA pw. It can be everything from using the key openly and the same for all drives and so on or have it properly defined, encrypted, decrypted by utilizing a hash from the ATA pw. 2. OPAL is a new specification for some newer SSDs or firmware updates to some older ones. Drives with that are independent from the mainboard. However, you need a 3rd party software in order to provide a PBA-programme that is then executed first at boot to let enter the pw. The pw is set by a management software within the particular operating system. The PBA-programme ist stored at some open (=always unencrypted) space on the SSD – because there must be something unencrypted before the encryption pw can be entered. This storage area for the PBS is different from the rest of the SSD that is inaccessible due to its AES encryption as long as no correct pw is provided. There is a software “Embassy Security Center” for about 40$ that seems to do this job: http://store.digitalriver.com/store/wavesys/en_US/home/ThemeID.13077500 I only need this software in order to modify or initially set the pw, but I can move the drive to any other machine, even without having this software installed on it, because the PBA works directly from out of the SSD and this is enough to enter the pw to unlock. So far so good. I will try it out in the next days after I receive my new PC with a Samsung 850 EVO 1TB in it. – A side comment: I wonder why the OPAL guys or drive manufacturers do not provide a universal PBA on their own? They could make a completely independent SSD, not depending on 3rd party software (OPAL Management), nor 3rd party hardware (Mainboard with BIOS for ATA pw). Just put a PBA in the SSD that at first start asks to set a pw and for later starts asks to enter the pw for unlocking or type in a listed command to modify/ delete the pw. That should not be so difficult. Why all this mess with relating SSD-encryption to BIOS, OS managed software, etc.? SSD encryption could or SHOULD be a stand alone solution. Reply r0m30 says: February 4, 2015 at 00:38 @Mosquito337 If that new computer is Windows 8.1 and you don’t mind giving Microsoft an administrative account on your machine and your keys eDrive will manage the hardware encryption of OPAL 2.0 drives. Re: the ability to move the drive with OPAL. You MAY be able to move the drive. It depends on the implementation of the software you use. The software could use the computers TPM to generate/manage the key and in this case moving the drive would probably not be possible. I don’t know for certain but from the description of ESC it looks like that is the case. It is also not required that a PBA be used, the software could install a UEFI module to manage the unlocking of the drive. The Enterprise SSC does not require the implementation of the shadow MBR table (where the PBA is stored). That is an interesting idea of combining the management environment into the PBA, I’ll have to take a look at making that an option for msed. As to why there is no universal PBA. The TCG (the OPAL guys) are a standards body and developing/releasing software would put them in direct competition with their sponsors. I wouldn’t expect to see the hardware vendors releasing OPAL management simply because the vast majority of their customers are going to be windows users who will use eDrive and blithely surrender their keys to MS. Reply pro says: February 3, 2015 at 22:04 “” I wonder why the OPAL guys or drive manufacturers do not provide a universal PBA on their own? Why all this mess with relating SSD-encryption to BIOS, OS managed software, etc.? “” Mosquito337, that is a good questions. All this hype and advertising of OPAL drives and SED’s and in practice it’s unusable by most users. Has anyone used r0m30’s software? I wouldn’t use some non official tool in case I got locked out of my own drive.. Reply r0m30 says: February 4, 2015 at 00:55 “I wouldn’t use some non official tool in case I got locked out of my own drive..” That’s interesting, one of the premises of this post is that you modify your bios to enable the use of the ATA password on motherboards that don’t have “official” ATA password support. The primary use of msed for the last year has been to recover Crucial SSD’s that the owner had been locked out of by Windows or another OPAL management software program, because until very recently Crucial did supply any software to do that job. Reply Mosquito337 says: February 6, 2015 at 18:47 Hi r0m30, my new computer is Win 7 Ultimate. No Win 8(.1) or 10 😉 I have no TPM chip installed. So I expect the OPAL management software to place the PBA on the SSD directly with no relation to the machine or mainboard, etc. I wonder, if I could put the SSD in another machine that boots up from another drive. There, I could install again the OPAL management software and access the SSD this time as non-system drive? It should be possible to unlock it without deleting it, as long as I provide the right pw, no? Anyway, as I have an ASrock mainboard (X99X Killer), I also contacted the support on the email provided above by Al Winston. They returned one day later with the BIOS Update including ATA security password handling. I understood the rest of their email, that 32 characters is fine and that nothing is stored in the CMOS of the BIOS, but transfered to the SSD. They say to not be able to help me, if I forget the pw – which is exactly what I want from them. I think, I will go with this feature to use the ATA security BIOS, if it was provided to me for free and there is no guarantee, too, that the OPAL management software will support moving the SSD to another machine, etc. I understand, that my data may be lost, if the mainboard fails. But this is just another risk as if the SSD would fail. I can do backups from time to time and store them in a Truecrypt (or Veracrypt) container on a USB external HDD. If the mainboard really would fail, I will get back the same as long there is warranty, and later, I could get one of the same cheap on a flea market, a used one at ebay, etc. I just have to store the BIOS Update at a safe place to reload it then. So actually nothing that could not be handled, I think. Reply HikingMike says: February 6, 2015 at 19:02 Great update Mosquito. Is there any chance you could try that test? After your configuration is complete, bring your encrypted SSD to another computer to learn if you could access it. Reply r0m30 says: February 7, 2015 at 01:12 @Mosquito337 Yes, msed managed drives can be unlocked and read on a different computer that boots from another drive if you install the host management program. One thing to be aware of is that msed only supports ATA attached drives. It will not try to manage/unlock a drive in a USB enclosure (although some usb enclosures under Linux do look like ATA attached drives so the host management software does work). The PBA and AK are managed independently of the bios/motherboard. The loadPBAimage command will place the PBA in the shadow MBR table on the drive. The drive then presents this image to the bios at boot time if the MBREnable flag is set. The password is hashed using the PBKDF2 function salting it with the drive serial number as returned by the ATA IDENTIFY command before it is sent to the drive as the “C PIN” (what the TCG calls the password). This creates a drive unique password for each managed drive. msed doesn’t create any superAdmin or other backdoor either, it never stores or saves your password, so if you forget your password you are in the same situation as with the BIOS password, except that, unlike ATA security, OPAL provides a way to crypto erase and reuse the drive if you have forgotten the password. You seem to have done your homework and are aware of the issues around encrypting your drive using the ATA password and/or OPAL, good luck and enjoy your new system. Reply Henrik says: February 12, 2016 at 00:22 r0m30> “msed doesn’t create any superAdmin or other backdoor either, it never stores or saves your password,” As a security(privacy) conscious user, I applaud that! I seriously love the work you do! Sadly however, this translates into “msed creates a single user system.” and as a security(availability) conscious admin I see a couple of problems. * You can not share a notebook with somebody, without also sharing the password. * You can not deposit a recovery password in a bank vault in case your CEO has a stroke. * You can not access data on the disk if your capricious marketing guy flips the table and leaves the company in a less than friendly mood. * You can not access the developer machine where an important local branch awaits pushing into the central git repository, while the developer is off hiking in the himalayas. Provided, you have a policy in place that forbids storing private data on company hardware, you (as a company) are owner of all the data stored on the disk. You have the right to access that data. Still you can’t if the user will not (or can not) provide the password. Sure, you can force your users to accept the password that you have selected for them and not provide an easy way to change it, but you can’t really guard against the user changing the password, as there is only one password, and it is THE master password. In most cases however, you will only add to the pile of post-it notes they keep hidden from you, because they are only human and can’t cope with yet another ugly long password. Heck, they have a hard time remembering their Facebook password, and without iforgot.apple.com they would be lost. There is a good reason for software like KeePass… I don’t know how much “multiuser” is provided by OPAL already and how much the management software needs to do by itself. In case there is only one key per locking range, I’d propose, storing that key in the PBA. Yes, even multiple copies of it! Each of them AES encrypted with a different user’s password. If the user wants to change his password, he provides his old password and the new password. Now “his” copy of the key gets decrypted with the old password and (properly salted) encrypted by the new one. In case you fear that a user deletes everybody else’s key files, you could keep your copy offline. Maybe even print its hexdump and put it in the vault… After all a 256bit key is only 43 characters (base64 encoded). Cheers -Henrik Reply r0m30 says: February 12, 2016 at 12:01 @Henrik Yes, msed/sedutil is a single user solution. It isn’t an enterprise solution and wasn’t meant to be. I understand the scenarios you list are real in the business world but they have access to solutions tailored to them (although one of those vendors recently filed for bankruptcy). Opal does provide multiple accounts for both “administrators” and “users”. Simple multi-user support wouldn’t be very difficult from the software side of things as long as only the global range is implemented. Setting up a sub-range creates a new key for the range so all the data that was there is lost and no matter how many times you warn people or how big the font you use to warn them when someone looses their data they are going to blame the software not themselves. I don’t see this as something that will be implemented in the near-term, currently the focus is on adding attachment support beyond ATA and making it easier to use. Reply Henrik says: February 15, 2016 at 18:00 @r0m30 The available management solutions for businesses (that I have looked into) at are Windows Based. At most they offer a Linux client if you buy into their windows server based infrastructure. After that, the fact that those are closed source products, seems hardly worth mentioning… BTW: Which vendor filed for bankruptcy? A solution with msed where multiple users have access to the same locking range, using their own password would address most of the user stories that I have mentioned. There would be a user called “admin” and his password would be stored in the vault. The normal user would provide his own password when going to get the machine from the IT department. Ideally, changing your own password would be possible from within the PBA, but that would be icing on the cake. It would e.g. allow installing a new machine by cloning it from an installation image, encrypting the drive with the admin password and a temporary user password, shipping it to the user and passing the temporary password via a different channel to him. One question: How could the “I’ve forgot my password. Help me admin. You’re my only hope.”-situation be handled? Would all users effectively have admin privileges to create/change/delete users on that locking range, or would every user be limited by opal to manipulating his own user entry? If so, how are users initially created? Reply r0m30 says: February 16, 2016 at 18:13 @Henrik Yes, the commercial solutions focus on Windows, that’s where the money is. Linux users tend to be more free/open source biased. Not worth mentioning or not interesting to you? Wave systems filed chapter 7 a few weeks ago. The SID user could be used in the scenario you describe. The SID has the authority to change the Admin passwords. So …… sedutil-cli –initialsetup userpassword /dev/sda sedutil-cli –sedSIDpassword userpassword secretpassword /dev/sda. Lock secretpassword in your vault. (double check the syntax, I’m doing this off the top of my head) If you need to access the data then you retrieve secretpassword and use it to set a new Admin1 password then you unlock the drive using the new Admin1 password. This also works for I forgot/lost my password please save me from my own recklessness. I want to keep the PBA as simple as possible so I would suggest wrapping the password change using sedutil-cli in a script or gui if you prefer. The above is an attempt to give you a solution for the current implementation of sedutil. The Opal spec has multiuser access functions that are not yet implemented that would allow for sharing of equipment without sharing passwords and segmenting the drive into sections that can have access granted/denied on a per user basis. Adding this functionality to sedutil is NOT expected any time soon. Reply Henrik says: March 22, 2016 at 16:35 > The SID user could be used in the scenario > you describe. The SID has the authority > to change the Admin passwords. So …… Seems like that is not the case.

Reply Mosquito337 says: February 12, 2015 at 02:12 @r0m30 Just got my PC with the Samsung 850 EVO. It seems to have this shitty master password already set and “security level high”, not “max”. I applied hdparm and it looks similar like this other guy found for his 840 Pro: https://www.zeitgeist.se/2014/09/07/enabling-ata-security-on-a-self-encrypting-ssd/#comment-3910 hdparm –Istdout /dev/sda (for me it is drive a, he has it as b, then sdb) the “word 128” tells about the security setting: “word 128 (0021): security status (bit 8: MASTER PASSWORD CAPABILITY ~ 0 = high, 1 = max; bit 4: SECURITY COUNT ~ 1 = EXPIRED; bit 3: SECURITY FROZEN; bit 2: SECURITY LOCKED; bit 1: SECURITY ENABLED)” I am stuck here. May move to OPAL if this could help, however, I am not sure, if this is a general feature, so that the “master password” will remain active even when I used a OPAL software (ok, I could check with hdparm afterwards, if this “bit 8” in “word 128” had changed to 1, finally. Reply r0m30 says: February 12, 2015 at 04:04 I’m no ATA security expert, I’ve never owned a machine that supported the BIOS password. What I can tell you is that once OPAL security is enabled the ATA security feature set is disabled by changing the DCO, OPAL and ATA security are mutually exclusive. You haven’t mentioned if the drive has data you want to keep on it, fair warning some of the steps below can/will erase the drive, Backup any data you value. Write down your PSID so you can revert the drive if necessary. Now do another backup 🙂 I’m guessing but the master password is probably there as a backdoor for Samsung magician to be able to “rescue” you from a forgotten/lost the ATA password. You can’t handle real security after all so the benevolent Samsung will make sure you don’t hurt yourself; Have you contacted the PC manufacture to see what they have to say about the master password? Maybe the are the ones creating the backdoor. Have you tried Samsung Magician? It has the capability to change the security state of the drive. You could try setting the drive to TCG status and seeing what hdparm and msed –query tell you after it makes the changes. I’m leery of the “eDrive” security status because I don’t know what Samsung thinks is so special about eDrive, it’s OPAL 2.0 with Single User Mode but they claim it’s special so they could disable the PSID user making a PSID revert impossible. This is against Microsoft’s recommendations for eDrive but without transparency you can’t be sure. On my 850 non-pro I didn’t do anything but run msed to setup the drive, but it was a new drive not part of an OEM package. Reply Mosquito337 says: February 12, 2015 at 13:27 Thank you r0m30 for this fruitful discussion! What you describe would be my next step. However, before that I will give the ATA security one last chance: According to https://www.zeitgeist.se/2014/09/07/enabling-ata-security-on-a-self-encrypting-ssd/ there should be a way to reset the Master Password, as long as the drive is unlocked (no user pw set) and the security level is 0 (“high”): hdparm –user-master m –security-set-pass masterpass /dev/sdb (or sda, if this is the SSD): “will overwrite factory default master password” I am not sure about the syntax, but hope that “masterpass” means the new password, so masterpass = BennyBunny for example (not my pw ;-). I should be able to then set a different user pw (e.g. Jabberwocky) in my Bios. Restart the system (with power off to let the drive lock), then enter the user pw to boot up my system and in a second run use the master pw to do the same. This should give proof, if I could redefine the master pw. Btw, yes I did backup my system. However, it is a clean one, so not much than OS itself on it. Will transfer my important data later to it, if all works. Here is more background information from Samsung about this master password: http://www.samsung.com/us/pdf/memory-storage/840PRO_25_SATA_III_Spec.pdf “The 840 PRO is shipped with master password set to 20h value (ASCII blanks) and the lock function disabled. The system manufacturer/dealer may set a new master password by using the SECURITY SET PASSWORD command, without enabling the lock function.” I hope this is same with 850 evo. -> I will try first before I change the master pw, if I can enter my drive after setting a user password (e.g. Jabberwocky) with just typing ” ” (space) as factory installed master password. That would be a great joke! Imagine millions of people feeling secure with their user passwords for pretty AES on SSD and anybody could compromise them by just entering a lucky space. Will let you know about that after I try it out later this day. Reply Mosquito337 says: February 13, 2015 at 00:10 Back from testing: 1. The good news is, the “master password” as space ” ” did not work. It could not be used instead a set user password to unlock the drive and get in to the data. Also “tttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt” (32 times t) as found somewhere in the net as known Samsung master password for hdds did not work. 2. However, there is still the indication that a master password exists and is set: I get that info in the Bios “Master password: installed” and hdparm shows “fffe” as indication for master password. It also shows “security level high” and not “max” which means whatever the master pw is, it can be used against my encryption. 3. I had a phone call with a support guy from Samsung in the US (although I do not live in the US; but in Switzerland, however there is no local supply). I asked him for the default factory setting of security level, high or max, and his answer was “max”. I did not trust him, because it sound like saying what I wanted to hear without the ability to prove. However, as mentioned above I could prove. Poor support (except he is right and it was the OEM PC builder to change settings). 4. The bad news is, I could not reset the master password with hdparm. I use the windows version and it says to not have all the security commands available to the time it was build. Maybe the linux version is different, but I give up here and will not test that. I also could not modify the security level from displayed “high” to “max” as this would still be ok to make the master password useless entering my data, but just allow to erase it. 5. I did not try to set the user password with hdparm, because I would not risk to be outlocked due to the mainboard maybe transferring the pw as scancodes (do not know that). 6. I have mailed my OEM computer supplier, if they have set a master password on their own or know what the one of Samsung is. I will let you know if I get a reply on this. 7. I thank so much ASRock support, even if they do provide to set the user password only and not the master password in the UEFI BIOS – at least they display the existence of this “Master password: installed” which made me suspicious that there is hiding something. I guess that one or the other mainboard manufacturer may leave that information out. Then people may be happy to set a user pw and think that it was – without knowing even the existence of something hidden master password to compromise them. Many big thanks to ASRock, please. 8. I will move on to OPAL and see how this works.. Cheers, Mosquito Reply Mosquito337 says: February 19, 2015 at 21:47 Finally moved ahead with TCG-OPAL using the Software Embassy Security Center for 40$. It took me less than 15 minutes to install and set enverything up. Meanwhile, I received some email responses for my investigation regarding the ATA security “master password”: 1. The OEM PC manufacturer (Alternate) claims to not be the culprit and not set or change passwords on harddrives. 2. ASRock support returned back with the following email, which I interpret as if they know and are setting this master pw: “The Master password function is designed for situation that forgot or lost the password. Because the ATA password is built in hard disk, if you got lost the password, the hard disk will be not able to use. This mean the Master password function is a backup solution and it’s needed. We will not make public about the rule of Master key, only in special situation like losing the password. Also, the Master password function is not able to be modified by user.” Anyway, thanks to them for the open communication, however, anybody using this ATA security function from ASRock as provided by the support should be aware, that they have a backup key to decrypt the data! Not really what one should expect using encryption. So obviously, this ATA security is no option to follow at all !!! Reply John Souvestre says: February 19, 2015 at 22:50 wrt ATA Master Password: I believe that there are two modes which the Master Password can be set to use. One works just like the regular password. In this case, I agree with you about it being insecure. The other mode, however, triggers a “wipe the disk” operation when used. Thus it allows recovering use of the disk but not the data on it. The BIOS on my Dell laptop allows me to choose which mode the Master Password should use. Needless to say, I chose the second mode. Any BIOS which doesn’t give you this option is severely flawed, in my opinion. Reply r0m30 says: February 20, 2015 at 04:11 Well at least you found out who was compromising the security. I agree that it isn’t what you or I would want but I’m certain that the mobo and drive vendors get orders of magnitude more complaints from the how could you let me brick my drive with my own stupidity complaints than how could you compromise my security complaints. I’m curious, did ESC install a driver to handle S3? If they did do you know where in the driver stack it lives?. Reply Arthur says: May 5, 2015 at 01:09 I sent an email to Charl and he suggested posting it here, so that others could benefit from it as well. Question: How do I know if my motherboard supports ATA password? There’s just no info anywhere on this, not in the reviews nor on manufacturer sites. Are there any updates on any other drives? I.e. Toshiba Q Series and Samsung 850 EVO and 850 PRO drives, and OCZ Vertex 180 and 460? And Intel 530 and 535? Those are newer versions for Samsung, OCZ and Intel, as I understand, so I think that’s quite relevant to the general public too. Answer: See this post: http://vxlabs.com/2015/02/11/use-the-hardware-based-full-disk-encryption-your-tcg-opal-ssd-with-msed/ — TCG Opal support makes all of this much more convenient. I currently have a Samsung 850 Pro with which I use the open source MSED tool. There are more easy to use solutions if you’re not on Linux. Reply Jethro says: May 7, 2015 at 03:01 According to this webpage http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/minisite/SSD/global/html/whitepaper/whitepaper06.html BOTH the Samsung 840 and 840 Pro support what you call “usable” encryption. Also, if you setup an encrypted drive in a Lenovo laptop that is now broken, you can still access your data, see https://jbeekman.nl/blog/2015/03/lenovo-thinkpad-hdd-password/ Reply John Souvestre says: October 21, 2015 at 01:36 I see nothing in the Samsung whitepaper which says how they protect the ATA password. It’s easy to protect the AED drive key, which they do talk about. I certainly agree that SED is more secure than FDE. But I notice that they downplay OPAL, which is more secure than SED. OPAL has been out long enough to be widely available and I haven’t seen any negative reviews about its security. Personally, I would not buy a SED drive today which wasn’t OPAL. Note: BIOS dependency is another drawback of the ATA method. Reply Datarecovery.com MK says: July 16, 2015 at 17:24 I thought I would post after reading some of the comments here. Fantastic discussion. SSDs can indeed be recovered by data recovery companies in general depending on the situation, though it’s not easy, and will likely cost more as a result. And the self-encrypting drives that are always encrypted (whether or not the user sets a password) will require use of the controller, so if there is an electronic failure, and the controller is not usable, basically there is no chance for recovery due to the encryption. Our clients are often (usually?) not aware of this. Of course oftentimes they don’t expect to have a drive failure either, or if they attempted to make backups, there was some issue and the backups weren’t occurring as expected. In our flash recoveries, we often need to remove the NAND chips, read them directly, and then piece the data back together using some utilities and often a little manual work. Obviously if the data is encrypted, we’ll just be reading encrypted data with no mechanism for decryption. We have a very different perspective than most reading this probably because if a client is sending something to us, they need the data back. It’s our job to do everything in our power to do that for them. Encryption is just an obstacle at that point. The data is what is important. We recover encrypted data for individual users, as well as large corporate clients on a regular basis – and they send us whatever credentials we need for decryption (which takes many forms depending on the encryption method used). In the case of SEDs where we can’t use the controller and its keys due to the failure, there is no recourse however. We have seen some manufacturer(s) revert their encryption practice in some ways to less secure methods in recent months. I won’t mention which devices, and I can’t say the reasons behind it, but speculation would point to support issues with clients losing their data. They have to weigh the tradeoffs. As a result, we have been able to recover some client data that we would otherwise have been unable to. I probably don’t need to say this for most people here, but I’ll say anyway – always keep a backup of important data, and check it to make sure it’s working.

Totally useless > http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/10/20/western_digital_bad_hard_drive_encryption/ It’s rather astonishing, actually. > Rookie errors make it child’s play to decrypt data Reply Ming says: January 3, 2016 at 20:59 Thanks r0m30 for making MSED and thanks to all for sharing your experiences in this post. My question in short: If I accept loosing the data, can I reset / remove the passwords on my Crucial M500 SED SSD? I set the passwords via my laptop BIOS. I remember the user password, bit I have forgotten the master password. hparm reports Security level = high I saw r0m30’s post and which sadly seems to imply I cannot reset it… ” msed doesn’t create any superAdmin or other backdoor either, it never stores or saves your password, so if you forget your password you are in the same situation as with the BIOS password, except that, unlike ATA security, OPAL provides a way to crypto erase and reuse the drive if you have forgotten the password.” I’m asking for help as I don’t want to brick this 1tb SSD and I couldn’t find any information on the net for my particular situation. Here are the lengthy details… I have a Crucial M500 SSD in my Toshiba Portege R930 laptop. My Toshiba laptop BIOS has settings for hard drive security. I setup up both the user password and master password. I understand this has setup the SED Authentication Key via the ATA SED commands (did I get that correct?). Whenever my Toshiba cold boots, I enter the user password and I can then boot into my OS (Windows). I remember my user password, however, I have forgotten my master password and lost the piece of paper that it was written on.. 🙁 I have an empty 1TB Toshiba HHD drive, so I am wondering whether I have an opportunity to try to recover from this situation. I plan to do the following: 1. Backup the Crucial drive to the Toshiba drive, including imaging the Windows system partition. 2. Reset/disable the security on the Crucial — which I understand would erase the drive. How do I reset and disable the security on the Crucial? There seems to be no way to do this from the Toshiba BIOS because I have forgotten the master password. And I am confused as to whether I can use MSED PIDRevert, because I activated the SED via the Toshiba BIOS. Does this mean the SED on the Crucial is only now configurable via Toshiba BIOS and is not configurable via MSED which uses Opal 2.0? (I understand the Crucial hardware wise is Opal 2.0 compliant.) Could I use http://www.crucial.com/usa/en/support-storage-executive to reset the Crucial and is there any difference between using Crucial’s tool or MSED? 3. Restore the system partition and all its data. 4a. Use MSED or the Toshiba BIOS to re-activate the SED Authentication Key. And this time write down the master password and store it safely. 🙂 or b. Use Truecrypt 7.1a and encrypt the drive. I am leaning towards Truecrypt because: i. It provides me with better disaster recovery options — i.e. if the laptop mainboard dies, I can move the Crucial drive to another system and keep working or at least access the files. ii. I have a SED Segate drive (ST1000LM015) in a HDD Caddy the Laptop’s optical storage bay. I’d like to encrypt this drive too. I understand the Segate is Opal 2.0 compliant, but I have no idea how to setup SED on this drive that is in a HDD Caddy. It seems to be connected to laptop via the same SATA interface as the Crucial, but I cannot be sure. However, if possible, I want to only enter a password _once_ after cold boot to access both hard drives. So it would seem easiest to do this via Truecrypt on both drives and use some automounting feature. iii. My CPU has AES support. Truecrypt benchmark is at 1.3GB/s for AES, which should mean very little impact on overall performance. If I trust Truecrypt, are there any significant reasons why I should choose option 4a instead of option 4b? Thanks in advance for your help! Ming p.s. here is the last part of the “hdparm -I” (www.sysresccd.org recovery CD) output on the Crucial: ” Security: Master password revision code = 65534 supported enabled not locked frozen not expired: security count supported: enhanced erase Security level high 2min for SECURITY ERASE UNIT. 2min for ENHANCED SECURITY ERASE UNIT. Checksum: correct ” I tried hdparm –security-disable PASSWORD /dev/X, with my user password, but it failed, saying the parameter wasn’t recognised. Probably because I only tried the user password and perhaps the hdparm on the http://www.sysresccd.org CD doesn’t support it?? I have a USB flash drive with Ubuntu and Linux mint installed so I could try hdparm from that. p.p.s. I also tested the SED security by putting the Crucial in another laptop. When the laptop booted it couldn’t access the drive at all, even though in the BIOS there was some kind of drive locking settings. Reply cpbotha says: January 3, 2016 at 21:17 r0m30 is the supreme expert on all things msed and also on TCG Opal, so I’m hoping he’ll chime in. TCG Opal with msed is a better option than relying on your laptop BIOS to pass your user and master passwords correctly on to the drive via ATA security. In my personal experience, laptop BIOSes sometimes use a completely different password for the ATA security than the ones you enter at the prompt. At least with msed, you know *exactly* which passwords are being configured via OPAL. After some quick googling, it doesn’t look like you’ll be able to PSID revert your drive (an Opal function) with the ATA security password set. These are two different modes of security: Opal on the one hand and ATA security on the other. However, besides waiting for r0m30, it’s probably also a good idea to post your question to the Crucial forums and to Crucial support. Furthermore, you might also want to contact Toshiba support to hear if they have a HDD password reset option. (For example Insyde H2O bios used on many laptops, because of its crappy ATA security implementation, has a push-over easy password reset function.) Reply r0m30 says: January 4, 2016 at 22:01 I agree with cpbotha on everything but the expert thing 😉 OPAL allows you to reuse the drive (with data loss) if you lose/forget the password, ATA security does not. At this point you have two low probability options. The first is contacting your laptop vendor and hope they use a “secret” master password instead of the one you supplied and that they have a way to reset the ATA security on the drive. The second is that the drive vendor has a way to access the ATA master password and can reset the ATA security. There are some vendors that do the first but I know of no drive vendors that will admit to the second. msed/sedutil will not work on a drive in ATA security mode. OPAL and ATA modes are mutually exclusive. If the drive in your caddy shows up as OPAL compliant when you do a –scan then you can set it up with the same password as your boot drive (no need to load a PBA) and the msed PBA will unlock both drives. That is the way I run my machine. msed however doesn’t support sleep (S3) so if you want to use sleep instead of hibernation then truecrypt may be a better option for you. Reply 1atpwwu says: January 12, 2016 at 11:02 Hi, thanks for all this excelent work and effort to bring it to the general public. I have two questions – are there any plans for full uefi support? And is there a way of any authorized access automatically rewriting the keys with random data efectively destroying everything. If it send a overvoltage pulse to the flash chips and destroy them it wold be even better (the latter would require hw support and is unlikely. Reply r0m30 says: January 14, 2016 at 23:56 I guess it depends on what you mean by full UEFI support. The latest version of the software in the Drive Trust repo has a UEFI PBA that will work if you turn off secure boot. If you mean a UEFI program that unlocks the drive and then loads the UEFI program on the unlocked drive or a signed PBA that supports secure boot then the answer is we are looking into those but they are not in the near term plan as we will be focusing on additional attachment support and ease of use. Do you mean something like the iOS option where the device is erased after x number of invalid passwords? There is nothing in the OPAL spec like that and implementing it in software would require that a password be stored to do the crypto erase so I don’t see it happening unless the TCG adds it to the spec. Reply 1atpwwu says: January 15, 2016 at 04:08 I meant suport for uefi fast boot. In bios mode it takes much longer to go from pressing the power buton to login prompt, Uefi + ultra fast boot takes a few seconds (and if the boot was more paralell it would take even less (most services could load in parallel) Second part would require hw support and the way I imagined is a large high voltage capacitor which could destroy the chips if any unauthorized access is detected. It could also serve as a power source to ensure all data is written in the event ot power loss, Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware Intel Kaby Lake Support On All Asus 100 Series Motherboards Confirmed By Keith May Posted 1 month ago 112Shares Share Tweet Submit With the upcoming launch of Intel’s Kaby Lake line of processors for the mainstream market there have been many questions regarding motherboard and chipset support. With the rumored 200 series chipset coming the launch has left people wondering if we’ll see support for the Kaby Lake coming to the 100 series since they share the same 1151 pin socket.  MSI has already stepped out and made a positive announcement, now who else?  Good news, at least for Asus owners looking to upgrade from their Sky Lake CPU to a newer Kaby Lake CPU are in luck.  A simple UEFI update will bring all of these motherboards up to spec to support all of the upcoming chips.   Doing the update is simple enough and can be done either though a USB drive in the UEFI or can be done within Windows.  These BIOS updates can be found today via their update tab on the ASUS website.   Instant compatibility with next-generation Intel Core processors All ASUS 100-series motherboards that include the ASUS USB BIOS Flashback feature allow users to apply UEFI BIOS updates with ease. For other ASUS 100-series motherboards the necessary UEFI BIOS update takes just one click in an easy-to-use Windows-based BIOS updater application, ASUS EZ Update, which is available to download from the ASUS website. Users keen to take advantage of the power of the next generation of LGA1151 Intel Core processors should visit product support page via www.asus.com and download the relevant UEFI BIOS version today. The following ASUS 100-series motherboards can be updated for compatibility with the latest Intel CPUs: Advertisement A future BIOS update will further improve performance and functionality.     The Kaby lake architecture constitutes the “Optimization” stage of Intel’s PAO cadence. Kaby Lake is looking to improve on what Sky Lake has already laid the foundation for.  One of those improvements is in efficiency that has allowed for higher clock speeds at the same TDP level, something greatly beneficial to those who would like a faster speed processor but lack the confidence in overclocking the CPU themselves.

On Monday, the Open Connectivity Foundation and the AllSeen Alliance announced they would merge under the OCF name. The two groups include companies such as Intel, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Samsung, Cisco Systems, GE Digital, and Haier -- possibly a critical mass of IoT component and product makers. OCF's scope even extends beyond home IoT into some industrial technologies. The internet of things depends on objects talking to each other, so standardization is important to making IoT easier to use and driving down prices through large-scale manufacturing. But efforts at interoperability started out by going in different directions. The fiercest rivalry was between the AllSeen Alliance, backed by Qualcomm and Microsoft, and the Open Interoperability Consortium (OIC), founded by Intel, Samsung, and others. Each had its own way for devices to discover and learn about each other. Now that the two groups are merging, there’s a greater chance that any given IoT product will be able to talk to others without using a hub or relying on cloud-based software. The merger won’t close down the open-source projects started by the two groups, AllJoyn for the AllSeen Alliance and IoTivity for OIC. Those will continue, both of them under The Linux Foundation. But the projects will collaborate to support future versions of the OCF specification with a single IoTivity implementation, the groups said in a press release. Current AllJoyn and IoTivity products will be interoperable and backward compatible, they said. The two groups were on a path to common ground as soon as the OCF was formed in February. The new organization incorporated all members of OIC as well as some other companies, including key members of AllSeen. Microsoft said at the time all Windows devices would natively interoperate with the OCF standard. Analysts predicted a couple of years ago that the fragmented world of IoT standards would come together in time. But consolidation hasn’t yet reached the point where consumers can buy any device and feel confident it will work with all their other connected gear. Other mergers and partnerships are also helping to create order in IoT. The Thread Group has made deals with the ZigBee Alliance and other groups to make their application platforms run on its networking stack. Pairings between companies like Cisco and IBM may make it easier for enterprises to build IoT platforms.

Clear Linux Continues To Maintain Slight Graphics Lead Over Ubuntu 16.10 Written by Michael Larabel in Operating Systems on 11 October 2016. Page 1 of 4. 16 Comments Back in April I did tests showing how Intel's Clear Linux distribution showed much potential for HD/Iris Graphics performance, something that intrigued many Phoronix readers since Clear Linux would generally be seen as a workstation/cloud/container-optimized Linux distribution and something with not much emphasis on the desktop or gaming. Those earlier tests were with Ubuntu 16.04, bur with Ubuntu 16.10 coming out this week, here are some fresh tests of Clear Linux and Ubuntu Yakkety Yak on an Skylake HD Graphics system. For curiosity sake, I ran some fresh Ubuntu 16.10 vs. Clear Linux (10820) benchmarks on the same Core i5 6600K system with an MSI Z170A GAMING PRO motherboard, 16GB DDR4-2133MHz memory, and 256GB TS256GSSD370S SSD. The mid-range i5-6600K is equipped with HD Graphics 530. Ubuntu 16.10 makes use of the Linux 4.8 kernel, X.Org Server 1.18.4, xf86-video-modesetting, GCC 6.2.0, and Mesa 12.0.3. Unfortunately Mesa 12.1 didn't make it thus for Yakkety Yak is just OpenGL 4.3 support rather than OpenGL 4.4 (officially, or unofficial 4.5 extension completion too). So in addition I also tested Ubuntu 16.10 when switching to Mesa 12.1-dev via the Oibaf PPA. Additionally, I did a secondary run of the Mesa 12.1-dev stack when switching to the Xfce version of Ubuntu 16.10 to complement the Unity 7.5 desktop numbers. Clear Linux currently ships with the Linux 4.8 kernel, GCC 6.2.0, and Mesa 12.1-dev. So the versions aren't vastly different between Ubuntu 16.10 and Clear Linux, but keep in mind Clear uses CPUFreq over P-State by default plus carries an assortment of other patches and optimized configurations with its default package set. All of these benchmarks were carried out in a fully-automated manner using the Phoronix Test Suite.

So when they approached me to review one of their Titan VR10 machines equipped with an nVidia GTX 1080, I couldn't pass up the opportunity. Today, PC gaming is within easy reach of more gamers than than ever before. With the likes of Origin, uPlay and STEAM, games can be bought, downloaded and played in less than an hour in many cases. Component prices are also more competitive today. A mid range CPU can typically accompany a modern next-gen graphics card such as a GTX 1060, and allow you to play games with visual settings turned up at 1080P. This review will focus on the product itself, rather than delve into technical frame rate analysis of games and run benchmarks. I am doing it this way for a number of reasons, chief of which is the abnormal nature of the component pairing in this system. The GPU is top end, but the CPU and motherboard won't be fully realising the GTX 1080's potential. Although they will run games just fine. A system like this might give those on a budget an idea of what to expect, or those who already have a similar system, and just want to increase graphics horsepower. "GeForce GTX 10 series is built to meet the demands of next-generation displays" - OcUK The Titan VR10 ForceBox is advertised as a system geared for nVidia's Geforce 10 series graphics cards. During this review, I will be focusing on overall observed system performance, as well as performance during gaming and CPU/RAM utilisation. The games I will be testing are Doom (2016), Wolfenstein: The Old Blood (2015), and Alien: Isolation (2014). All three of these games are known for their graphical quality, as well as how taxing they can be at their respective ultra graphical settings at 4K resolution on lesser graphics cards. 4K is the focus here. A GTX 1080 is no slouch, and I wanted to see how it could handle games at a resolution of 4096x2160. Specifications Case Phanteks Enthoo Evolv Power supply Kolink KL-600 CPU Intel Core i5-6400 (2.7GHz, boost @ 3.2GHz) RAM 2x 4GB Team Group 2400MHz (DDR4) Motherboard Asus H110I-Plus miniITX (Intel Skylake) Core connectivity 4x USB2.0 (rear), 2x USB3.0 (rear), 2x USB3.0 (front) mic, line-in, speakers out, Gigabit LAN, HDMI, VGA, DVI Graphics Inno3D GTX 1080 8GB Founders Edition (HDMI, DVI, 3x DisplayPort) Sound On-board 7.1 HD Storage (OS) Kingston V300 120GB SSD Storage (data) Seagate Barracuda 1TB HDD OS Windows 10 Price as specced £1285 (International shipping costs will vary) The price might seem expensive at first glance, but when the individual component prices are broken down, it makes much better sense. The GTX 1080 (£619), i5-6400 (£179), and the Phanteks Enthoo Evolv (£99) account for £897 alone. once you add an OS, HDD/SSD and other extras, it all adds up. As I have already mentioned, the GTX 1080 does seem an odd pairing with the rest of the system specs. The motherboard only allows for 8 PCI Express lanes where the GPU can handle 16, so the full potential is immediately limited here. And I predict some CPU bottlenecking might be at play in some games. I have never heard of Kolink before, a quick search shows that they appear to make cheap PSUs, the KL-600 retails at under £40, for example, and no reviews for them appear to be online which doesn't fill me with confidence. Make of that what you will, but my personal preference would be to switch the PSU out for a well regarded one. As an example, a Corsair CX600M is also 80 Plus Bronze certified, and outputs 46A on the +12v line with a max power rating of 552W. The KL-600 above is 37.5A with 450W. Having said that, after some further digging, I found that Kolink are the people behind Noctua, and as many of you will already know, Noctua make some top quality products. Build quality and features The VR10 uses the Phanteks Enthoo Evolv mATX case. I have only ever heard good things about Phanteks, so was pleased to see that my expectations for a high quality case were easily met. The panels are nicely textured, tapping them results in a confident noise rather than a hollow reverb as often found on cheaper cases. There is a single 180mm intake fan, with vents and mount points for additional fans at the back and top. Removable dust filters for the front and PSU intakes are also included. In usage, I found the single intake to be sufficient, as there are plenty of exhaust vents for ambient heat to escape in such a case design. Both the i5 and GTX 1080 are power efficient components, and there wasn't a great deal of heat generated in any condition. Cooling was certainly nothing to worry about. During gaming, the fans ramp up and became slightly more audible. During normal desktop use, or when watching videos, the VR10 was near silent, making for an excellent system to either work, or be entertained without a whirring distraction. The UEFI BIOS shows a healthy amount of information about the status of the system. At an ambient room temperature of just over 23 degrees, the CPU temp showed a steady 29 degrees until a game was fired up, at which point it rose to the mid 40s. The 1TB HDD is hidden away under the SSD bracket. It is quite hard to get to from the main side panel without removing the SSD. Although for easy HDD access, you can remove the other side panel and use the HDD release pinch instead. The system builders at Overclockers UK did a fine job of hiding away any messy cabling. Even on the other side, cables were tied down securely with the built-in velcro fasteners. This makes cleaning relatively easy, as dust will collect on even the most filtered of cases out there. The green LED strips are not part of the Phanteks case, but instead have been added by Overclockers UK. They provide a green glow through the front panel openings, and there is no way to control brightness, so they could become annoying if the PC is placed on top of a desk and is being used in dim lighting. I also found that removal of the front dust filter was problematic due to the way the LED strips had been taped onto it. The strips could have been secured a different way I feel, perhaps on the front panel itself, or from inside the case, as the light would still shine through the dust filter mesh. Performance DOOM id Tech 6 powers the latest shooter, and it is absolutely beautiful. Although when standing up close to some textures, they can look a little fuzzy on a 65" display at 2160P resolution. regardless, performance was a constant 60fps. I could not unlock the framerate on Doom sadly, and Vsync was off. At least it is good to know that with every setting turned to maximum, the game never once flustered on the GTX 1080 and i5-6400 combo. This was in the default OpenGL mode. I found that Doom's Vulkan mode to be too buggy to give a confident verdict. WOLFENSTEIN: THE OLD BLOOD Even though Wolfenstein isn't as luscious as Doom, it still offers good paced action and quality graphics all the same. However, the performance was just not up to scratch with Doom. On average, I was pulling 35-45fps at 2160P with 4x antialiasing . Dropping this to 2x resulted in slightly improved performance, but I was unable to maintain a solid 60fps. Dropping the resolution to 1440P, or lowering the graphical settings was the only way to ensure a minimum of 60fps with this game. I wanted to see if the i5-6400 was holding the GTX 1080 back, so had Windows performance monitor running to track CPU usage. High utilisation can be seen, and the reason for the low minimum framerate was clear. ALIEN: ISOLATION The space bound scare-a-thon hit 85fps in many instances, and always stayed above 60fps. Like Doom, every setting was maxed. This game is the oldest of the three, but is easily just as stunning visually, and in most cases, has a greater level of texture detail up close. Conclusion As a gaming PC, then, the ForceBox VR10 is very good. two out of the three games I played on it at 4096x2160 gave at least a constant 60fps with all graphics settings set to maximum. Sadly, games with a strong focus on CPU power to maintain a higher minimum framerate will show the flaw in mating a high end GPU with a lower end CPU. I should comment on just how quiet the VR10 is during gaming, I was able to enjoy the spooky ambience aboard the Sevastopol in Alien: Isolation, without being distracted by fan noises. The VR10 is not without faults of course, the Kolink PSU raises questions, the LED strip placement needs to be revised, or perhaps even removed entirely. And while it looks nice, I can't help but feel the Enthoo case would look even more elegant with no lighting. The x8 PCI Express lane also limits the full potential of the GTX 1080. In desktop applications, from browsing the web, to managing files and running applications, the VR10 performed as I'd expect from this spec. Although at times I could feel that the i5-6400 perhaps wasn't as snappy at multitasking applications at the kind of speed that I'm used to on an i7 system. Consulting the VR10 product page, I notice that there is no i7 option. The highest that can be selected is the i5-6600. Overall, I was mostly pleased with the gaming performance of the VR10. it does what it says on the tin, and does it quietly. Unlike many other pre-built gaming computers out there, it doesn't look like the helmet of a Power Ranger either. It would be nice to see more choice when configuring a VR10 PC. A selection of compatible motherboards and power supplies for each budget bracket would make it perfect. The Kolink KL-600 may be good, or it may be bad. There isn't enough information out there to confirm, and with such an expensive graphics card in such a system, I'd rather take the side of caution and replace it with something proven. I am happy to give the VR10 with GTX 1080 a rating of 8. A couple of points must be knocked off due to the limited component options offered. If you would like to price up your own VR10 system, then be sure to check out the configurator page over at Overclockers UK.   Tags Pc Vr10 Gaming Gtx 1080 Review Ocuk Overclockers uk Like Tweet Share Share Report a problem with article Previous Story Apple Watch Series 2 review: it doesn't suck Next Story This Weekend's PC Game Deals: The price crusaders are bringing the sword to your wallet Related Stories 8Pack OrionX Extreme: Probably one of the fastest PC out there?

News & Analysis Specs Pave Roads Around Xeon Two groups prep data center interconnects Rick Merritt 10/11/2016 08:30 AM EDT 3 comments NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. – Two separate groups today debut new 25 Gbit/second processor and memory interfaces for data center systems. Their common goal is to provide a more open alternative to what many expect Intel plans with its Xeon processors, Altera FPGAs and 3D Xpoint memories. The Gen-Z consortium is defining a bus based on the Ethernet physical layer for next-generation memories. The Cache Coherent Interconnect for Accelerators (CCIX) will use the PCI Express Gen 4 PHY for its CPU-to-accelerator link. The groups aim to create de facto standards that let any ARM, IBM Power or x86 processor link to any accelerator chip or any of an emerging handful of storage-class memories. Both groups got their start about a year ago. After Intel bid to acquire Altera last June, processor makers started approaching Xilinx about designing alternative cache-coherent interfaces to its FPGAs, and Xilinx proposed merging the efforts. Similarly, work on Gen-Z was fueled by Intel’s suggestion at its annual developer conference last year that its 3D Xpoint memories will need a new systems interface. Intel has yet to detail its plans for a 3D Xpoint interface. So far it is saying it will use a combination of its proprietary Quick Path Interconnect and PCIe to link its Xeon processors and Altera FPGAs.

Who knows what Intel will do with these new standards. I have a feeling Intel is going to be stubborn and stick to their "If we didn't create it then we won't use" mentality but I hope I'm wrong about this. I hope that Intel does finally come around and use these standards in future processors and I want to add Nvidia to this. I hope they adopt both standards.

I assume that this work is an extension of the memory centric architecture we've all been reading about lately. So now there are third parties involved in developing these high-speed interconnects between CPU, accelerators, memory, and FPGAs. Intel owns the CPU (and at least one FPGA solution) so are we to expext that at some point Intel will take these third party developed interconnects and build an SoC that contains all these bits and pieces?

Mark Williams hits the Labs and compares the best of the best. Reviews in this Group Test - Recommended - Asus ROG Rampage V Edition 10 - Best Value - ASRock Fatal1ty X99 Professional Gaming i7 Gigabyte GA-X99-Designare EX - Recommended - MSI X99A Xpower Gaming Titanium Intel’s High End Desktop (HEDT) range, while aimed at computing enthusiasts, also targets big business and enterprises needing powerful workstations. As such the HEDT platform needs to be supported for longer periods of time as companies like having stable platforms they can get a good return on investment with. This means the lifecycle of the HEDT platform, currently in the form of the X99 chipset, is about three to four years instead of the typical one or two years on mainstream platforms and is also the reason why you’ll find Xeon and registered memory compatibility along with consumer Core i7 and unregistered memory support on this one platform. To keep performance relevant over that time scale, Intel committed to supporting two generations of CPU for each HEDT platform allowing drop in CPU upgrades. For the previous X79 chipset that was Sandy Bridge-E then Ivy Bridge-E CPUs. For the current X99 chipset it’s Haswell-E followed by Broadwell-E. With the Broadwell-E CPU not long out, it marks the second half of the X99 platforms lifespan, and with the improved CPUs now available the platform can hit its full performance stride especially now that Intel have a ten core hyper-threaded monster to shove into it, in the form of the i7 6950X. As it has been about two years since X99 launched, motherboard manufacturers have taken the CPU refresh as a cue to refresh their X99 board offerings, with an eye to include new tech that wasn’t around in 2014. We test four of the top offerings, one from each manufacturer, aimed at gamers and enthusiasts to put through their paces. How we tested. It was harder than you’d think! With Intel introducing its new Turbo Boost 3 tech with Broadwell-E, we wanted to test this functionality along with the big claims motherboard manufacturers constantly make about their beyond DDR4-3000 memory support. Basically we wanted to have XMP and Turbo Boost 3 both enabled and working at the same time during our tests. However, as you’ll read in each review, it wasn’t as simple as that in most cases. Often enabling XMP resulted in Turbo Boost 3 simply not working until some other BIOS settings were tweaked. XMP on one board caused continuous rebooting, on another a particular benchmark consistently failed, and one simply ignored Turbo Boost 3 altogether, by design! So, using Intel’s top of the line i7 6950X we benchmarked each board with a 4x8GB DDR4 kit with its DDR-3200 XMP profile enabled along with Turbo Boost 3 enabled in BIOS along with the OS level Intel driver installed to facilitate the boosting of single or lightly threaded tasks to 4GHz on a single core. Each benchmark was then run three times, including one run with the driver disabled just in case it actually hurt performance, which it did in a few scenarios, then recorded the best result of the three runs. In the end only one board could do this with no other setting changes other than enabling the XMP profile. Read on to find out which. CONCLUSION  Performance wise the Asus board walks away with first place in all but one test, establishing yet another reason why it is able to command the premium price that it does. Here’s where it gets murky though, despite MSI coming a pretty convincing second place, Gigabyte’s BIOS issues and subsequent use of a beta BIOS to work around them resulted in a CPU that ran at 3.4GHz in multithreaded tasks (100MHz less than the others) meaning Gigabyte’s results aren’t very representative of their true performance. Judging by the Gigabyte boards memory speed tests, they are more likely around MSI’s performance capabilities. The ASRock offering gets a technical bronze medal thanks to Gigabyte’s issues, however it is well deserved. It won the 7-zip benchmark and came outright second in the y-cruncher tests, while not being far behind the leaders in all the other tests, except for the memory speed test where it was markedly slower. But, with a future BIOS update perhaps memory compatibility can be further improved, removing this problem. Having to manually set DRAM frequencies and OC profiles to provide XMP + Turbo Boost 3 compatibility could well be a cause too. From a price/performance perspective MSI is clearly the best option of the four, a solid second place performer combined with a lovely looking BIOS that eventually ended up the best for XMP + Turbo Boost 3 compatibility. As long as you don’t want flashy RGB lighting it’s the stand out choice.

"The Perimeta virtualized SBC (vSBC) can easily replace legacy systems without sacrificing any functionality or performance while giving operators an easy and flexible way to deploy this advanced network function in their cloud," said Carsten Rossenhövel, EANTC's managing director. "Whether deployed to facilitate plain SIP traffic in a network or for complex call handling in VoLTE environments, we found that the Perimeta vSBC meets typical service provider performance requirements." The tests, commissioned by Intel® under the Intel Network Builders Program, included both call signaling and audio stream processing and evaluated Perimeta's ability to assist in troubleshooting and to provide high-availability clustering. The comparison between the virtualized and appliance-based capabilities included evaluations of both OpenStack and VMware-based deployments. In evaluating security characteristics, Perimeta was found to effectively limit call rates when overloaded, and also to maintain baseline call signaling performance when subjected to DDoS attacks. Test Highlights EANTC cited the following as a result of the tests: Consistent, identical functionality when compared to legacy Perimeta SBC appliances Highly valuable alarm, event logging and call analysis when used in conjunction with the Metaswitch Service Assurance Server (SAS) Stable performance and reliable operation in overload conditions Ability to handle as many as 700 signaled calls per second and 78,000 simultaneous media sessions with no measurable difference in terms of QoS for both signaling and media compared to appliance based SBCs Verification of high availability "We are extremely pleased with the results of the EANTC testing, which demonstrates yet again the superior performance of our leading Perimeta vSBC, as experienced by our growing customer base of global service providers in real-world deployments," said Micaela Giuhat, vice president of product management at Metaswitch. "The virtualized Perimeta SBC offers providers clear advantages over proprietary or legacy COTS-based deployments, decreasing the time to revenue and providing compelling cost savings."

Performance-Boosting HiZ Support Lands For Intel's Mesa Vulkan Driver Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 7 October 2016 at 04:13 PM EDT. 1 Comment Intel's "ANV" Mesa Vulkan Linux driver now has basic support for HiZ, an important performance feature. A while back I wrote about Intel Vulkan driver HiZ patches that were on the mailing list while today they were merged into Mesa Git -- in time for next week's feature freeze for the next Mesa mailing list. So far Hierarchical-Z is only implemented for basic cases, but in those basic triangle-type Vulkan demos there is about a 15% performance boost and around a 30% performance boost for the demos making use of fast depth clears. For now the HiZ ANV Vulkan implementation probably won't translate into any real performance gains for Linux's current Vulkan games: Dota 2 and The Talos Princple, but nevertheless great to see the basic support hitting Git. 1 Comment Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

New Intel Kaby Lake processor for class-leading performance. Vibrant high-resolution touch display. Improved battery life over previous Stealth. Cons Key travel is a bit shallow. Bottom Line Super sleek, delivering top-notch performance and battery life, and loaded with useful extras, the Kaby Lake CPU–equipped Razer Blade Stealth ultraportable laptop is even better than its highly rated predecessor. By Matthew Buzzi The original Blade Stealth, released earlier this year, was Razer's foray into the mainstream laptop space, an ultraportable without discrete graphics despite the company's firm roots in the gaming market. The ultra-thin-and-light impressed us as an excellent general-use ultraportable, with top-notch build quality, a sharp 2,560-by-1,440 (QHD) touch screen, and cool extras like the world's first keyboard with individually backlit keys. The latest Blade Stealth (starts at $999.99; $1,249.99 as tested) features almost exactly the same body and physical design, but with a couple of beneficial additions. With a fresh Kaby Lake processor—the newest generation from Intel—for markedly improved performance, and longer battery life, the new Blade Stealth manages to earn our highest recommendation—even over its excellent Editors' Choice–winning predecessor. //Compare Similar Products Compare Razer Blade Stealth (4K UHD, Early 2016)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Asus ZenBook 3 (UX390UA)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it HP Spectre 13   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Apple MacBook Air 13-Inch (2015)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Dell XPS 13 Touch (2016 Gold Edition)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Apple MacBook Pro 13-Inch, Retina Display (2015)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Design and Features By looks alone, you can't tell the new Stealth apart from the original. It features the same 12-inch, high-end black machined aluminum body, green Razer logo on the lid, and keyboard with per-key backlighting. There are two rubber strips on the bottom for grip, along with the fan vents. View All 6 Photos in Gallery The new model measures 0.52 by 12.6 by 8.1 inches (HWD) and weighs 2.9 pounds, slightly deeper and heavier than the previous version (0.52 by 12.6 by 6.1 inches, 2.81 pounds) to make room for a larger battery, though the difference isn't noticeable. It is something of a case of diminishing returns when a laptop is already this slim, but there are thinner and lighter ultraportables, like the new Asus ZenBook 3 (0.47 by 11.65 by 7.53 inches, 1.97 pounds) and the HP Spectre 13 (0.41 by 12.8 by 9.03 inches, 2.45 pounds). Again, the display is a standout on this system: Our unit boasts a QHD touch display with Indium-Gallium-Zinc-Oxide (IGZO) technology for brighter, more vibrant colors. It's an attractive screen, and that high resolution gives you extra room to work—especially useful for a 12.5-inch notebook with a bezel this wide (about 0.75 inch, versus just over 0.25 inch for the ZenBook 3). As with the last-generation Stealth you can also choose a 4K display when ordering, but that option is also tied to larger storage amounts, so the price will jump to at least $1,599.99. QHD still gives you a really sharp picture, though, and is a higher resolution than you'll find on many 1080p ultraportables like the 13-inch Apple MacBook Air, and even the more expensive ZenBook 3 and Spectre 13. Individual key backlighting is not a must-have, but there's no denying it looks excellent, and is another feature to separate this laptop from the pack. Through Razer's Synapse software and Chroma lighting technology, you can change the light effects and colors, and if you don't want anything flashy, just set the lights to one static color, or turn them off. That last option is there if you want it, but I suspect most will like how it looks—it helps that the lighting is crisp and bright, unlike on some keyboards where light bleeds through the keycaps. With the ability to change the color of each key independently, and with extra effects in the software like matching the lighting to music, the Chroma keyboard is a definite plus. The keys themselves are good quality; there isn't much travel to them, which may irritate some users, but they're generally fine. The touchpad, as on all previous Blade systems I've used, is one of the best: sturdy, super smooth, and responsive. The two speakers, one on either side of the keyboard, are capable of getting quite loud for such a small system. The sound quality at lower volumes is fine, but there is some distortion if you dial up to maximum. Slim laptops don't tend to offer many ports, but one upside to not being the on the super-thin end of the spectrum like the ZenBook 3 or the Apple MacBook is the inclusion of more than just USB-C. On the left, there's the USB-C charging port with Thunderbolt 3, a USB 3.0 port, and the headphone jack. On the right, there's another USB 3.0 port and an HDMI port. It's not a large suite of port options, and the same group as on the original Stealth, but the essentials are there. Also included are dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, a TPM security chip, and a 2-megapixel webcam. For storage, our model comes with a 256GB solid-state drive (SSD) with Windows 10 installed, but there are 128GB and 512GB options available as well with the QHD screen. Alternatively, you can order a 4K model with a 512GB or 1TB SSD. Changing the storage model alters the laptop's price fairly significantly, so it's up to you to decide how important that is—the 1TB maximum limit is new compared with the previous Stealth. Razer offers a one-year warranty on its laptops. Performance The Kaby Lake generation of processors is one of the main upgrades driving this Stealth—every new configuration, regardless of resolution or storage capacity, includes a 2.7GHz Core i7-7500U CPU. That and the 16GB of memory helped this system provide strong performance scores across the board. On the PCMark 8 Work Conventional test for measuring general productivity, the new Stealth scored 3,032 points. This beats the previous Stealth (2,764) and falls slightly behind the more expensive Spectre 13 (3,069) and ZenBook 3 (3,228). That might seem like a discrepancy given the Stealth's faster processor, but the PCMark 8 results reflect the higher demands of the QHD resolution compared with 1080p on those two systems—there realistically isn't much of a difference in day-to-day use. See How We Test Laptops Multimedia test results better demonstrate the Kaby Lake processor's speed upgrade, in spite of the more demanding resolution. The new Stealth beat all comers—including the Gold Edition Dell XPS 13 Touch and the 13-inch Apple MacBook Pro—on the Handbrake encoding test with a time of 2 minutes, 3 seconds, the next closest competitor being the ZenBook 3 at 2:13. It also posted the fastest Photoshop time (3:41) and the highest CineBench score (354) of any ultraportable. Like the other ultraportable systems, regardless of price tier, the Stealth includes integrated Intel graphics. A discrete graphics card adds a lot to price and, more important for this category, requires much more physical room than a super-slim laptop affords. With Intel HD Graphics 620, the new Stealth was able to post so-so results of 21 frames per second (fps) and 25fps on the 1,366-by-768-resolution Heaven and Valley with medium details. Considering 30fps is the minimum target for smooth gameplay, most modern games are a bridge too far for the Stealth and other ultraportables—these frame rates exactly match the Spectre 13's and beat out the ZenBook's. With these tests set to Ultra graphics quality and 1080p, performance slowed to a crawl. You can get away with playing simple games, and maybe some less-strenuous titles on low settings, but don't expect to do heavy gaming on this system, despite the Razer name. Note that the Razer Core external graphics card enclosure is designed to allow thin Razer laptops like the Stealth access to more powerful desktop graphics processing. It costs $499 and must be purchased separately, though you get a $100 discount if you buy it with a Stealth. It uses the USB-C port, which further diminishes connectivity, and supplies seem limited—it may take a few weeks to receive one after you place your order. Finally, the extra room added in the back of the system means good things for battery life, when combined with the more power-efficient processor. The Stealth lasted 9 hours, 20 minutes, on our rundown test, a nearly 2-hour improvement over the previous Stealth (7:36). The QHD resolution definitely plays a part in draining power, though, since the ZenBook 3 lasted 12:07 and the MacBook Air 13-inch ran for 17:36 on the same test, but 9 hours is still a good time, and more than we saw from the Spectre 13 (8:36). Conclusion The New Razer Blade Stealth is stylish, thin, and faster than before, with a measurably longer battery to boot. It's an all-around upgrade—there's no reason to buy the previous model now (except perhaps for a slashed price)—and there are more configuration options available if you'd like a ton of storage and a 4K display. If you want something that's thinner and more elegant, and you don't mind paying more money, the Asus ZenBook 3 is gorgeous and about as powerful as the Stealth, though it lacks the higher screen resolution and "fun" additions. Between the sleek look, fast performance, features like USB-C with Thunderbolt 3, and higher-than-average resolution, the New Razer Blade Stealth is our new Editors' Choice for midrange ultraportables, and one of the best in any price tier.

This folding tablet-laptop hybrid is unlike any other product on the market, as it takes the concept of the 10-inch tablet with a keyboard and replaces the cumbersome docking mechanism with the Yoga series’ signature 360-degree hinge. The resulting hardware is a beautifully slim tablet that folds apart like a book, transforming it into a lightweight, portable laptop. Lenovo is aiming for the best of both worlds here: a compact tablet that’s easy to hold and transport; and an on-the-go laptop that isn’t hindered by an awkward dock, mediocre keyboard case, or confusing tablet stand. To achieve this goal, naturally there are some trade-offs. There is a keyboard attached to this tablet, however there are no physical keys; you’re typing on a touchscreen slate. It’s not particularly powerful either, packing an Intel Atom x5-Z8550 processor and 4 GB of RAM. To make up for these, Lenovo has packed in a range of compelling stylus features. The touchscreen keyboard slate can be used as an accurate graphics tablet with the included pen, or you can slap a piece of paper on the slate and write physical notes while they are simultaneously digitized. Lenovo also claims the Yoga Book is good for 13 hours of battery life, which sounds impressive considering its size. The Yoga Book ($550 running Windows, $500 on Android) is one of the most attractive pieces of hardware I’ve used this year. The magnesium-aluminium alloy shell is sleek and gives this product a premium aesthetic, especially combined with Lenovo’s watchband hinge. The frosted glass touchpad complements the design well, as does the glossy glass protecting the display. There are very few distracting elements as well, aside from some removable stickers from Intel and Microsoft, which helps deliver the minimalist look this tablet deserves. The most impressive aspect to the Yoga Book is how compact the entire device is. It’s a 10-inch tablet, so we were always getting a portable footprint, however the slimness is the key to this design’s success. The Yoga Book is just 9.6mm thick when closed, which is unbelievable for a device that opens into two sections. The base, which includes the touch slate, is a slight wedge that maxes out at just over 6mm thick, while the display lid is a slender 3.5mm. When open, the Yoga Book looks astonishing. Of course a 9.6mm thick 10-inch tablet isn’t hugely impressive, so if the Yoga Book were merely a standard tablet I wouldn’t be raving about the thickness. The impressive feat here is getting the Yoga Book in its closed tablet mode to match typical 10-inch tablets, while still featuring a hinge that allows it to open into a laptop. There is no product on the market that achieves this, and that’s what makes the Yoga Book stand out from such uninteresting competition. The Yoga Book is one of the most attractive pieces of hardware I’ve used this year. In its tablet mode, the 690-gram device is quite usable, but don’t expect an experience that rivals the Apple iPad Air 2. Not only is the iPad several hundred grams lighter, but it also features a more comfortable 4:3 screen aspect ratio. The 16:10 display on the Yoga Book makes it a little awkward to use as an entertainment device like the iPad, but it’s clear that the strengths of this tablet lie in productivity and creativity instead. The watchband hinge that connects the two halves of the Yoga Book is as beautiful as it has been on past Lenovo convertibles. The hinge allows 36-degrees of fluid movement, yet it’s strong enough that any position you choose will be maintained in a reasonably stable fashion. I say “reasonably” because there is some wobble in the display half when using the touchscreen in laptop mode, however, despite this, the angle of the hinge is maintained. The touch slate section is interesting as it serves two functions. When typing, the backlit keys appear from nowhere to provide a full keyboard with function keys and a trackpad. But when you hit the pen button, the keyboard disappears and the slate can be used as a graphics tablet within the printed bounds that match the size of the Yoga Book’s display. You can still see the outline of the keyboard under light, but the dual-function design is effective. Around the edges of the touch slate is where you’ll find all the key ports and buttons. The right side includes a 3.5mm audio jack, the power button, and the volume rocker, as well as one speaker grill for the stereo side-firing speakers. I did find myself accidentally hitting the power button a few times while I was using the Yoga Book as a laptop due to its awkward position, and I’d rather the power and volume buttons were switched. On the left side is a rather odd combination of ports: microUSB for charging and accessories, along with micro-HDMI. The Yoga Book is a device crying out for USB-C, so the inclusion of microUSB instead is baffling. And it’s not a size issue: there’s enough thickness in the Yoga Book to comfortably slot in USB-C, which would have provided greater compatibility with upcoming accessories and removed the need for the HDMI port (USB-C can be easily adapted to full-sized HDMI or DisplayPort). The inclusion of microUSB over USB-C indicates to me that the Yoga Book has been in development for a long time, and near-final hardware was locked in before USB-C began its surge in late 2015. USB-C is a really disappointing omission from the Yoga Book, but at least with a microUSB to USB adapter you can still attach regular accessories. The Yoga Book also includes a nano-SIM tray for integrated 4G LTE functionality, and two cameras: one for selfies above the display, in the Book’s large bezels; and another above the backspace key in the touchscreen slate. This seems like a weird position for a secondary camera, but when you fold the device into tablet mode, this camera becomes rear facing. Both cameras are pretty average in terms of quality, so I wouldn’t want to take any holiday photos on this tablet.

Volunteers claim, that pictures were taken in one of the zones of current disengagement of forces. It means they are talking about the areas of village Zolote or Petrivske, because scheduled for yesterday withdrawal of forces from the Stanytsia Luhanska have failed. Commenting the pictures, which they called ‘a motivator for the upcoming working week for all who believe in demilitarization', they wrote: "Why do we need demilitarization on the territories in the zone of combat activity? So that terrorists could freely expand their bases of supply and equipment maintenance in the immediate vicinity of peaceful Ukrainian settlements."

Thanks to kernel patches, the users won’t face problems in HDMI audio, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth etc. while using Linux operating systems on such device. If you own a small desktop computer powered by Intel Atom processor that are based on Bay Trail and Cherry Trail SOCs, running Windows OS on them doesn’t pose any problem. However, installing Linux distributions is a different story. Attempting to do so results in HDMI audio, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth problems etc. To address this situation, Linuxium–developer Ian Morrison–has released Ubuntu builds for the mini PCs. On his blog, he writes that Ubuntu is well suited for Mini PCs as its different flavors provide the option to run a lightweight Linux-based OS. He has created ISO images specifically for Intel Compute Stick. These images also work with other Atom Bay Trail and Cherry Trail processors. Linuxium has combined the source code and recent patches to port them with Ubuntu kernel source. This has allowed him to provide a fully functional HDMI audio, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi experience. Apart from Ubuntu, users can also download images for Lubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Ubuntu GNOME, and Ubuntu MATE.

This merger will advance interoperability between connected devices from both groups, enabling the full operating potential of IoT and representing a significant step towards a connected ecosystem. The newly merged groups will collaborate on future OCF specifications, as well as the IoTivity and AllJoyn open source projects. The expanded OCF board of directors will consist of executives from a wide array of leading companies: AB Electrolux, Arçelik A.S., ARRIS International plc, CableLabs, Canon, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., GE Digital, Haier, Intel, LG Electronics, Inc., Microsoft, Qualcomm, Samsung Electronics, and Technicolor SA. OCF will now sponsor both the IoTivity and AllJoyn open source projects at The Linux Foundation. Both projects will collaborate to support future versions of the OCF specification in a single IoTivity implementation that combines the best of both technologies into a unified solution. Current devices running on either AllJoyn or IoTivity solutions will be interoperable and backward-compatible. Companies already developing IoT solutions based on either technology can proceed with the confidence that their products will be compatible with the unified IoT standard that the industry has been asking for. The merger is designed to leverage the strengths of each organization. To this merger, the AllSeen Alliance brings its diverse, global membership, proven AllJoyn technology, and millions of AllJoyn enabled products into the market through the AllJoyn Certified program. OCF brings its deep membership roster, formal IoT standards with expertise across multiple vertical markets and cloud-native architecture as implemented within the IoTivity framework. Together, these strengths create an organization that establishes the broad interoperability needed to realize the full market potential for IoT. READ MORE: https://openconnectivity.org/join...

DRM Driver Changes Sent In For Linux 4.9, Sadly No Changes For Nouveau Written by Michael Larabel in Hardware on 11 October 2016 at 06:24 PM EDT. 20 Comments David Airlie a short time ago submitted the Linux 4.9 DRM subsystem update, including the much sought after open-source Direct Rendering Manager driver improvements. There's a lot of good stuff in here, but sadly the Nouveau changes look like they're going to have to wait until Linux 4.10. Highlights for the DRM updates in Linux 4.9 include: AMDGPU gets Virtual Display Support, improved GPU reset support, PowerPlay for Iceland GPUs, pre-initialized VRAM buffer support, a GTT code rework, UVD/VEC power-gating for Carrizo and Stoney hardware, and a fun experimental feature... Experimental Southern Islands support! But like the GCN 1.0 support, this GCN 1.0 AMDGPU support needs to be enabled at compile-time via a new Kconfig switch. Not for a while will AMDGPU support GCN 1.0/1.1 GPUs by default rather than the mature Radeon DRM driver. See my early GCN 1.0/1.1 AMDGPU benchmarks from the DRM-Next code for those with Radeon HD 7000 series and similar hardware that may want to try running this experimental functionality. The Intel DRM driver has its usual wide assortment of fixes and improvements including DMA-BUF implicit fencing, memory management improvements, frame-buffer compression fixes, vGPU improvements, better DisplayPort dongle support, and more. The Raspberry Pi VC4 DRM driver meanwhile has CPU/memory overhead reduction during 3D rendering and other improvements. When it comes to the smaller DRM drivers, the Mediatek DRM code has AAL + GAMMA engine and temporal dithering support, iMX has color space conversion support, Rockchip has Panel Self Refresh (PSR) support as well as RK339 VOP/CRTC support, Freedreno MSM has explicit fence FD support, Etnaviv has GC3000 support, and the Sunxi DRM driver has Allwinner A33 support. Sadly, there are no Nouveau DRM driver changes included with this Linux 4.9 pull request... This is especially sad as the initial Nouveau "Boost" support was expected to land. Of no open-source NVIDIA driver changes, David Airlie commented, "there is no nouveau work in this tree, as Ben didn't get a pull request in, and he was fighting moving to atomic and adding mst support, so maybe best it waits for a cycle." Thus due to atomic mode-setting work and DP Multi-Stream Transport (MST) work, it doesn't look like any Nouveau changes will come for Linux 4.9 but rather all the work be postponed to Linux 4.10. The complete pull request with all the DRM driver changes can be found via this kernel mailing list message. 20 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

While you were sleeping: UPDATED Stocks drop as Alcoa result falls short Margreet Dietz Wednesday October 12, 2016 Share Play NBR radio on Wall Street dropped after Alcoa kicked off the US third quarter earnings season with a result that missed estimates and produced an outlook that fell short of expectations. "Alcoa is always the first off and seen as a bellwether for industrial demand," St. Louis-based EverBank's world markets president Chris Gaffney told Bloomberg. "People need to see strong earnings, especially with the thought that rates will start moving higher. The environment for companies is going to get less accommodating. The drivers today and going forward are going to be earnings." Shares of Alcoa were down 11% at the close. "You are coming up against very low expectations, which means the bar is already low," Sarhan Capital chief executive Adam Sarhan told Reuters. "If you can't match those expectations, then investors are going to quickly move to the exit." The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 200.38 points, ot 1.1%, to 18,128.66. The Nasdaq Composite Index retreated 1.5% to 5246.79, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index declined 1.2% to 2136.73. Apple gains from Samsung's trouble The Dow fell, led by slides in Merck and Intel shares, down 2.9% and 2.8% respectively. Shares of Apple bucked the trend, eking out a 0.2% gain, as rival Samsung Electronics said it had stopped production of its fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 smart phone. "This is the first time that I have seen a product recall go this badly wrong," financial analyst Richard Windsor told clients, Reuters reported. "When it comes to the damage that it will do to Samsung's brand, we are in uncharted territory." Also bucking the trend were Tyson Foods shares, which traded 1.25% higher. The US meat company agreed to buy a 5% stake in Beyond Meat, a producer of plant-based protein. The terms of the agreement were not disclosed. "We're enthusiastic about this investment, which gives us exposure to a fast-growing segment of the protein market," Tyson Foods' executive vice-president of strategy and new ventures Monica McGurk says. "It meets our desire to offer consumers choices and to consider how we can serve an ever-growing and diverse global population, while remaining focused on our core prepared foods and animal protein businesses." Shares of Illumina tumbled 25% after the gene-sequencing company cut its revenue guidance.  Oil falls on glut report US crude oil fell 1.1% to $US50.79 a barrel after a report from the International Energy Agency suggested global supplies rose in September. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the session with a drop of 0.5%. The UK's FTSE 100 Index and Germany's DAX Index each slid 0.4%, while France's CAC 40 Index gave up 0.6%. The UK pound dropped, trading 1.8% weaker against the US dollar after sliding to $US1.2090 earlier in the day, as Bank of England policy makers exacerbated concern negotiations to exit the European Union will further hurt the currency. "The sentiment on sterling is closely tied to expectations of hard Brexit," Amsterdam-based ABN Amro currency and commodity strategist Georgette Boele told Bloomberg.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Intel Falcon 8+ UAV takes to North American skies by Bruno Ferreira  12:41 PM on October 11, 2016 It's pretty hard to read the news these days without hearing about drones. However, most of the news are about amateur-level drones, or commercial offerings for relatively simple tasks. Intel's latest effort aims to fly a little higher than that, though. Meet the Intel Falcon 8+ System UAV, a V-shaped octocopter packed with redundant systems, announced today at the Intergeo conference in Hamburg. Intel says the Falcon 8+'s electronics systems are fully redundant, and that the drone includes "automated aerial-sensing solution" and a triple-redundant Ascending Technologies Trinity autopilot system. The Falcon 8+ UAV is apparently targeted at aerial imaging and data collection jobs, as evidenced by the millimeter-accurate ground sample distance (GSD) of its camera system. According to Intel, all the avionics and gear in the Falcon 8+ make it an excellent candidate for structural analysis jobs. The drone itself is only a part of the package, though. The aptly-named Intel Cockpit serves as a control station for the UAV and includes a tablet computer for flight planning and monitoring. The Cockpit is water-resistant and looks rugged enough to our eyes. (We'd also wager that with a little work, it can made into a totally-awesome arcade joystick.) The Falcon 8+ is targeted at the North American market and is a successor of Ascending Technologies' Falcon 8 drone. Intel snapped up AscTec back in January and has apparently made good use of the company's technology. Intel offered no price for the UAV system, but we'd wager this falls squarely into drone-monitored, "if you have to ask" territory.

We’ve got some initial coverage of all of those products here at HotHardware if you’d like some additional background on the full line-up, including hands-on video of the latest ZenBook and smartwatch. However, we couldn’t wait to dive in a little deeper with the ZenBook 3 for a couple of reasons. First off, the ZenBook 3 is the first Ultrabook to hit the lab built around Intel’s brand-new Kaby Lake-based 7th Generation Core series processors. If you’re unfamiliar with Kaby Lake, it is the follow-up product to last year’s Skylake, and features improved responsiveness, a beefed up multimedia engine, and it's built with a refined 14nm process that improves clocks and overall power efficiency. For a deeper dive on Kaby Lake, check this out. The ASUS ZenBook 3 The ASUS ZenBook 3 also happens to be one of the thinnest and lightest Ultrabooks to hit the market, but despite its diminutive form factor, it is packing some sought after amenities like a NVMe PCIe SSD, 802.11ac 2x2 MIMO Wi-Fi, a backlit keyboard, and Windows Hello-compatible fingerprint reader -- at least on the Core i7-based model. We’ve got the rest of the ZenBook 3’s main features and specifications listed below if you’d like to inspect more of the particulars. On the pages ahead we’ll dig in a little deeper to see just how well this bleeding edge Ultrabook behaves with some benchmarks and battery life tests, and we'll explore the user experience as well. ASUS ZenBook 3 Specifications & Features CPU Intel 7th-generation Core i7-7500U, Intel 7th-generation Core i5-7200U Display 12.5in (16:9) LED backlit Full HD (1920x1080) anti-glare, with 72% NTSC gamut ultra-thin 7.6mm bezel / 82% screen-to-body ratio Operating system Microsoft Windows 10 Pro / Windows 10 Home Graphics Intel HD Graphics 620 Main memory 16GB LPDDR3 2133MHz or 8GB LPDDR3 1866MHz Storage 512GB PCIe x4 Gen 3 SSD or 256GB SATA SSD Connectivity 802.11ac Wi-Fi Camera VGA Webcam I/O ports 1 x combo audio jack, 1 x USB 3.1 Type-C (Supports display output and power delivery) Audio 4 x high-quality speakers (2 x full-range, 2 x 5-magnet bass drivers) with ASUS SonicMaster Premium technology and Harman Kardon tuning Security  Touchpad-mounted fingerprint scanner (UX390UA-XH74-BL) Battery 40W lithium-polymer, 6-cell battery AC adapter Output: 20V DC, 2.25A, 45W, Input: 100 -240V AC, 50/60Hz universal Dimensions 296 x 191.2 x 11.9mm / 11.65 x 7.53 x 0.47 inches Weight 910g/ 2lbs with battery Models and Pricing ZenBook 3 UX390UA-XH74-BL - $1599, UX390UA-DH51-GR - $1099 The ZenBook 3 Will Be Offered In 3 Colors - Rose Gold, Royal Blue, and Quarts Grey The ASUS ZenBook 3’s specifications read like a premium Ultrabook’s should. There will initially be two version of the ZenBook 3 on the market, one packing a Core i7-7500U, 16GB of 2133MHz LPDDR3 RAM, and a 512GB SSD, and another with a Core i5-7200U, 8GB of 1866MHz RAM, and a 256GB SSD. The form factor is identical between the two systems, as are the 12.5” FullHD display, keyboard, touchpad, and other features. The only “gotchas” with the ZenBook 3 – at least for some of you – will be ASUS’ choice of IO and the lack of wired network connector. ASUS almost went “full-Apple” on us and equipped the ZenBook 3 with only a single USB-Type C connector, though there’s a headphone / microphone jack on-board too. Although some of you probably won’t mind, having to use a dongle to plug in a device with a full sized USB connector, use the HDMI output, or charge the ZenBook, while also having a USB device attached, this single connector will be a hindrance for some. On the plus side, ASUS includes the aforementioned dongle with the ZenBook 3, along with a warranty card, a basic user’s manual, and an attractive folio carrying case, with magnetic latch. A lightweight, relatively small wall-wart type charging adapter is included as well, of course.

In this afternoon’s (11 October) Budget for 2017, Finance Minister Michael Noonan, TD, outlined an expected reduction in capital gains tax (CGT) from 20pc to 10pc up to a limit of €1m in chargeable gains. Cosmetically at least, this sounds similar to the UK’s rate but is, in fact, still very far removed. “I will review the €1m lifetime limit in future budgets. All other aspects of the relief remain unchanged,” Noonan promised. ‘If they were going to do something that small I would have preferred if they increased the cap beyond €1m rather than simply reduce the rate on the first million’ – BRIAN CAULFIELD “This is pretty minimal,” said Caulfield, a partner at leading $9bn Silicon Valley venture capital firm, Draper Esprit. “If they were going to do something that small I would have preferred if they increased the cap beyond €1m rather than simply reduce the rate on the first million.” He pointed out that if an entrepreneur sold a company for £10m in the UK, that entrepreneur would pay £1m in tax. However, if you made a €10m gain from the sale of a company in Ireland, you would qualify for 10pc up to a limit of €1m in chargeable gains. This means the tax on the sale of a company is reduced from 33pc down to 31pc in Budget 2017. “Which is pretty meaningless compared to the UK where you would pay three times less tax.” Caulfield is an established entrepreneur and was an early investor in Movidius which was recently sold to Intel for a reported $300m. Prior to being a venture capitalist, Caulfield sold Exceptis Technologies, an electronic payments company, to Baltimore Technologies in November 2000 for US$26m. Six years later, he sold Similarity Systems, a data quality company, to IT giant Informatica Corporation for US$55m in cash. Caulfield also served as interim CEO of Belfast mobile cloud firm Aepona. Intel acquired that company for US$120m in 2013. Caulfield last year slammed the reductions to CGT in the Budget of 2016 as derisory. Time is running out as Irish entrepreneurs eye the UK Caulfield said that while he noted Minister Noonan’s intention to review the €1m cap, the timing is a disappointment. He also said it was disappointing that plans to review Ireland’s policy towards share-based remuneration of employees and plans to introduce an SME-focused, share-based incentive scheme are being shelved until next year. ‘It is not a flood but it is definitely happening’ – BRIAN CAULFIELD “It is being kicked to touch for another year, that is a disaster and disappointing for so many companies. “They say they are working on it but it could be 2018 which means yet another year and I’m not even sure if the present Government will last that long. Where will it leave us if we have another election in the meantime?” Caulfield said that on the bright side, the decision to increase the earned income tax credit for self-employed workers and directors of companies by €400 is a step in the right direction. But it still falls far short of the €1,650 tax credit for PAYE workers. Caulfield warned that Irish start-ups locating in the UK to avail of more beneficial and realistic tax treatment is no mere threat. “It is not a flood but it is definitely happening. “There is no question that Brexit might slow it down a bit but Irish start-ups are also attracted to the UK EIS scheme which makes early-stage capital much more readily available in the UK. “There are definitely companies choosing to go to London rather than set up in Dublin for these reasons,” Caulfield warned.

If you've been waiting anxiously to play Skyrim on your PS4 or Xbox One, the time is almost here. Bethesda announced yesterday that the upcoming remaster has gone gold, which means it should be on time for its release later this month. Pass the Meadâ¦ Skyrim Special Edition has Gone Gold! More info: https://t.co/zDbwR4xOnO pic.twitter.com/q3J8kWLP6r— BethesdaGameStudios (@BethesdaStudios) October 10, 2016 Alongside that news, Bethesda also announced the system requirements for the PC version of the Special Edition, and they're quite modest. Here's the rig you need: Minimum requirements OS: Windows 7/8.1/10 (64-bit version) CPU: Intel i5-750/AMD Phenom II X4-945 RAM: 8 GB HDD: 12 GB Video Card: NVIDIA GTX 470 1GB / AMD HD 7870 2GB Recommended requirements OS: Windows 7/8.1/10 (64-bit version) CPU: Intel i5-2400/AMD FX-8320 RAM: 8 GB HDD: 12 GB Video Card: NVIDIA GTX 780 3GB / AMD R9 290 4GB Obviously, these requirements are a bit steeper than what you needed to run the original when it launched in 2011, but they're still pretty middle-of-the-road these days. Remember, if you own the Legendary Edition of Skyrim (on Steam), or the base game and all the DLC (on Steam), you'll receive the new Special Edition free of charge (on Steam). If you're a console player, you're probably more interested in how big the install will be. For PS4 players, it will be 20 GB in North America, and 33 GB in Europe. Xbox One owners will need 17 GB in North America, and 25 GB in Europe. The Skyrim Special Edition is set to release on October 28 on PC, PS4, and Xbox One.

By SueChang Markets reporter AnoraMahmudova Reporter U.S. stocks on Tuesday posted their biggest percentage drop since early September after aluminum giant Alcoa Inc.’s results cast a shadow over the broader market as third-quarter earnings season got under way. A stronger dollar and a retreat in oil prices also hurt sentiment. Alcoa AA, +1.99%  shares skidded 11% after the company reported results that missed expectations. That is the biggest daily percentage drop for the stock since Aug. 8, 2011, according to FactSet data. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.75% slid 26.93 points, or 1.2%, to close at 2,136.73, with all of its main sectors finishing in the red. Health-care and materials sectors were the biggest losers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.29% dropped 200.38 points, or 1.1%, to end at 18,128.66. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.10% fell 81.89 points, or 1.5%, to close at 5,246.79, dragged down by heavy losses in biotech stocks. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF IBB, -0.60% tumbled 3.8%. Both the large cap and the blue-chip indexes posted their worst percentage declines since Sept. 13, while the Nasdaq had its worst day since Sept. 9. Ryan Larson, head of equity trading at RBC Global Asset Management, said “disappointing earnings from Alcoa” factored in the slump. Some analysts also pointed out that rising expectations for a rate increase in December are pushing up the dollar as well as Treasury yields. “The odds are now around 68% the Fed will increase rates in December. This in itself is weighing heavy on equities for we all know [that] the markets fall with any hints of a change in monetary policy,” said Kent Engelke, chief economic strategist at Capitol Securities Management Inc. Putin supports OPEC deal at energy summit(1:35) Russian President Vladimir Putin will support international efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to limit oil production. Frank Cappelleri, an executive director at Instinet LLC, said today’s sell-off is important to monitor in the “days and weeks ahead” for a worrisome long-term trend, and with the S&P 500 having closed below 2,140, the index may find buying interest emerging as it nears the 2,115-2,120 range. The dollar, as measured by the ICE U.S. dollar index DXY, -0.20% , rose 0.7% to 97.65, from 96.92 seen late in New York on Monday. Check out: This chart offers the best explanation why the stock market is diving “This [dollar strength] is starting to make life difficult for U.S. stocks, but hopefully earnings season will jolt the S&P 500 out of its current grinding range,” said Chris Beauchamp, IG’s chief market analyst, in a note to investors. In other currencies, the pound GBPUSD, +0.3453%  marked fresh losses after media reports of leaked government papers that predict the country stands to lose £66 billion ($81.1 billion) a year in tax revenue in the event of a clean break with the European Union, or a “hard Brexit.” Opinion: Is this ‘bone-chilling’ indicator really saying ‘sell’ stocks?

West Texas Intermediate crude futures US:CLX6  pulled back although it is still trading above $50 a barrel. Oil prices slipped after the International Energy Agency said production from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries rose to record highs in September. On Monday, oil rallied on bullish comments from Saudi Arabia’s energy minister and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Major oil producers are meeting in Istanbul to try to lay the groundwork for a definitive deal to cap production. Goldman Sachs warned clients that if a production deal isn’t reached in Vienna next month, oil prices could plunge to $43 a barrel. Economic reports and Fed speakers: There was no major economic data on tap Tuesday. Speaking in Australia earlier, Federal Reserve of Chicago President Charles Evans said the U.S. economy is on a sound footing and he wouldn’t be surprised by a December interest-rate hike, Dow Jones Newswires reported. Stocks to watch: Yum Brands Inc. YUM, +0.00% shares rose 1% after the company outlined plans to boost growth at its fast-food restaurants once the sale of units it owns in China are completed on Oct. 31. The owner of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell said it was reducing capital expenditures to $100 million by 2019 from a pro forma of $500 million in 2015.

The company has permanently halted the production and sale of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone amid reports of the phones exploding and catching fire. Shares of Samsung’s biggest rival, Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.32%  , rose 0.3%, after hitting their highest level of 2016 Monday after one analyst said the iPhone maker could sell millions of its own phones on the back of Samsung’s woes. Illumina Inc. ILMN, +0.31%  shares cratered 25% and were on track for the worst daily loss in five years, according to FactSet data, after the biotech company issued a revenue warning late Monday. Shares of LPL Financial Holdings Inc. LPLA, -1.62%  jumped 6.9% on reports that it was exploring a sale and had hired Goldman Sachs Group to assist. Other markets: European stocks SXXP, +0.27%  were mostly weaker with notable losses for oil-related names. In Asia, the Nikkei NIK, +1.10% rose nearly 1% on a weaker yen. Gold prices GCZ6, +0.38%  ended lower while the yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.60% at one point rose to 1.78% — its highest level in more than four months. --Barbara Kollmeyer contributed to this article.

But RHEL switched it to becoming an alternative to Windows Server.” Download this free guide Defining the datacentre needs of 21st century enterprises A collection of our most popular articles on datacentre management, including: Cloud vs. Colocation: Why both make sense for the enterprise right now; AWS at 10: How the cloud giant shook up enterprise IT and Life on the edge: The benefits of using micro datacenters Start Download Corporate E-mail Address: You forgot to provide an Email Address.

In the early 1990s, after Microsoft’s famous divorce from IBM, the software company decided to go it alone and develop its own operating system. Windows 3.x became the de facto standard for the PC desktop, while the IBM rival OS, OS/2, failed to gain much traction. But as PC chips became faster and Intel’s first proper 32-bit processor, the 80386, saw success, Microsoft embarked on a project to get into server computing, the domain of the Unix machines. Meanwhile, in Helsinki, a 21-year-old Finnish student, Linus Torvalds, began working on an operating system that could take advantage of some of the advanced features that 80386-powered PCs had to offer, such as the 32-bit instruction set and paged memory. The PC became so successful because it represented the so-called industry standard architecture, on which operating systems and application software could run. But as it became more complex, more and more device driver software was needed to connect sound cards, display adapters and network ports. And all of this software needed support. According to Percival, Windows NT server had as much of a challenge as Linux in supporting the range of hardware the operating system could support. “Microsoft did a very good job on certification,” he said. Similarly, companies such as Red Hat and SuSE created Linux distributions, which were certified to run on specific hardware. Percival added: “One of the reasons that businesses jumped in was because Red Hat produced a range of certified devices.” Read more about enterprise Linux Businesses can deploy a mix of Linux server software offerings to take advantage of the cost and flexibility benefits of open source. Systems administrators who manage Linux in the enterprise can use these tips to keep the operating system – and the business – humming along. Although it started out as an alternative to Unix, Linux has evolved into a robust enterprise operating system. Without the world of open source and Linux, we would not have the kind of scale to run a cloud. While many supporters argue that cost should not be the main reason for choosing open source, Percival said: “Imagine trying to use a Tandem NonStop system to run Netflix. You would never afford to buy it.” In the past, a premium server like NonStop would be used when extremely high availability was a priority. Such systems were very expensive. Today’s IT architectures achieve high availability at a much lower price point by using large numbers of commodity Linux servers instead of one highly resilient box. So, for the enterprise, Linux has provided a low-cost base platform on which to run large internet applications, mainly as an alternative to proprietary Unix systems. Hot patching In a blog post earlier this year, Forrester analyst Richard Fichera described how hot patching was now available on SuSE Linux, giving the OS a level of maintainability usually available only on mainframe systems. In the post, he predicted this would become a standard feature of the Linux kernel. “It is almost certain that a future release of the 4.x kernel will contain production-ready hot patch as a standard feature, placing the burden on the Unix providers to prove they can keep up with Linux,” he said. According to Fichera’s blog, neither Oracle (with Solaris), IBM (Aix) or HPE (HP-UX) have developed equivalent capabilities in their respective versions of Unix. What is also interesting is that Linux was also pitted against Windows, and some organisations, such as the city of Munich, made public commitments to move to open source, even running desktop Linux rather than Windows PCs. This is something that Linux distributor Ubuntu continues to push, said Jane Silber, CEO of Canonical, which supports Ubuntu. “While the cloud runs almost entirely on Linux, we think the desktop remains an important focus for Linux innovation, too,” she said. Enterprise focus To compete with Windows and commercial Unixes, Linux has had to become more palatable to business. Thanks to the efforts of organisations such as SuSE, Red Hat and many others, Linux is very much a part of the enterprise. Their efforts, and the licensing frameworks from the GNU Foundation and Apache Software Foundation, have paved the way to making open source and Linux powerful forces in modern computing. Jonathan Bryce, president of OpenStack, said: “OpenStack has followed a similar path to Linux and we learnt from Linux.” Specifically, said Bryce, in the mid-1990s, Linux was a very tech operating system, but from 1999 there were commercial efforts to make it accessible and trusted by enterprises. It not only replaced Unix servers, but has also been used when Windows servers failed. Dave Rosenburg, senior vice-president at the Linux Foundation, said: “Whenever there was a dead or dying Windows box, we used to put Linux on it. Our web servers were pretty low-powered machines, but they had 100% uptime on Linux. The Windows NT server would fall over within four hours.” Who would have thought, 25 years ago, that Linux would cement itself as the de facto standard for running highly scalable cloud infrastructure in state-of-the-art datacentre computing? Linux has clearly come a long way, and in doing so, it has established open source as a sound alternative to commercial software, suitable for the smallest to the largest organisations on the planet.

The result has been positioning across fixed income markets and equity sectors in an effort to benefit from the current environment. In the first half of 2016, the “bond proxy” sectors such as Telecom and Utilities dramatically outperformed the S&P 500 Index until the 10-year Treasury hit a low of 1.36% in July. Since the July 8th low, the subsequent rise in yields combined with Federal Reserve comments about a possible December rate hike propelled investors out of bond proxy sectors into more growth-oriented sectors such as Technology. Historically “dividend growth” companies demonstrating earnings growth, strong free cash flow and rising dividends have been resilient in a rising interest rate scenario. Numerous studies point to the last eight Fed fund hikes where “dividend growers” experience strong performance compared to dividend non-payers, cutters and companies that don’t consistently increase their dividend. See chart below.   The U.S. bull market continues to forge ahead looking beyond the negative S&P 500 earnings projection for this quarter of -1.1% which would be the sixth negative quarter in a row. In the fourth quarter, we believe greater stability in the dollar and oil prices should help corporate earnings beat lowered expectations. This quarter we noted a slower pace of several shareholder-friendly policies such as share buybacks and dividend growth rates. Despite the shift away from share buybacks, the Materials, Industrials, Financials, Technology and Energy sectors are projected* to accelerate their dividend growth along with stronger growth prospects with improving revenues. As the search for yield continues into the end of the year, investors may be rewarded with S&P earnings finally turning positive and higher dividends in growth-oriented sectors. Three of the four top gainers in the Dow Industrials over the past three months were Technology stocks with relatively high dividends – Apple, Intel and Microsoft – while the lowest returns were found in ExxonMobil, McDonalds and Walt Disney. For the quarter, the strongest sectors in the Navigator® High Dividend Equity portfolio were Technology +12.4%, ­Financials +4.0% and Industrials +3.6%, and the weakest were Utilities -6.8%, Telecom -6.6% and Staples -3.3%. Stocks purchased during the quarter included PPG Inc, Microchip Technology, Morgan Stanley, Kinder Morgan, IBM and sales were Kimberly Clark, Lyondell, Wyndham Worldwide, Public Storage and Disney.

The solution acts like virtual fibre by extending GPON networks with twisted pair or coax within multi-dwelling units (MDUs) and single-family households (SFUs). The new reference design leverages Sckipio's breakthrough dynamic time assignment technology (DTA), which provides up to 1Gbps of broadband access in either direction. The solution also supports reverse power feeding from Microsemi to make it easy to implement in many environments including at the door, at the floor, in the basement or outside the residence. Sckipio's solution uses a very thin management layer for G.fast allowing operators to keep their existing GPON management layer and to extend it with a separate G.fast management layer. This speeds up the FTTH rollout by avoiding costly and time consuming IT integration of new management protocols into existing management frameworks. The joint reference design was build in conjunction with Intel and Microsemi, offering OEMs the fastest path to deployable single-port DPUs. The solution will work within an existing Intel-based GPON management infrastructure. "Sckipio is opening up an entirely new use-case for G.fast," said Teresa Mastrangelo, Principal Analyst, Broadbandtrends. "By combining DTA and unmanaged G.fast, Sckipio makes it effortless to add G.fast to any GPON network." About Sckipio Sckipio, the leader in G.fast, develops award-winning, standards-compliant G.fast modems used to enable ultra-broadband access and mobile backhaul. Sckipio partners with more than 30 companies globally on G.fast and is one of the leading contributors to the ITU-T standard. For more information about Sckipio, visit our website at www.sckipio.com.

How much progress has there been since Ada Lovelace Day began in 2009? Ada Lovelace. Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images Olivia Solon in San Francisco Tuesday 11 October 2016 04.00 EDT Last modified on Tuesday 11 October 2016 08.33 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger This article is 1 month old It is eight years since journalist and software activist Suw Charman-Anderson founded Ada Lovelace Day, aiming to raise the profile of women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics and celebrate their achievements. The day is named after Lord Byron’s daughter Ada, a mathematician who worked with Charles Babbage to create and program the world’s first general purpose computer, the analytical engine, creating the precursor to modern programming. On Ada Lovelace Day, here are seven other pioneering women in tech Read more Eight years is an age in Silicon Valley – so how much tech progress has there been in tech companies themselves since Ada Lovelace Day began in 2009? “We are trying to effect cultural change,” Charman-Anderson told the Guardian. “But you don’t change culture overnight. Equality is here, but it’s not evenly distributed. Some technology companies are doing a grand job. Other companies need to work a lot harder. “I don’t think merely knowing how many women there are in the boardroom gets to the heart of what we’re trying to achieve. It’s not just a surface parity of the same number of men and women in certain job roles – it’s really a foundational parity where girls and boys can grow up and be anything, and that’s not seen as unusual,” she said. One key area of concern for Charman-Anderson is the rise of misogyny online. “We’ve seen a ramp-up over the last few years of online abuse, although I don’t think there would be this backlash if we hadn’t made progress.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage. Photograph: tearlel/HM Passport Office What does this progress look like in Silicon Valley? “It’s varied. Intel is spending $300m on diversity, and Apple $50m, but none of the Silicon Valley giants are anywhere near parity in terms of women in their overall workforce, and not even hitting 20% women in tech roles,” Charman-Anderson said. She points out that many of the large companies have internal networks to support, mentor and champion female employees but that more could be done. “Women leave tech for a variety of reasons, such as not seeing opportunities for advancement, hostile male culture, feelings of isolation – it’s not that they want to leave to have a family, as is often assumed,” she said. “These sorts of cultural problems can be solved much more quickly than we can train up a new generation of girls and women, but I don’t think this part of the problem is being taken seriously enough.” Ada Lovelace, trailblazer of science, brought to life in exhibition Read more Here is a snapshot of the gender divide as taken from tech companies’ diversity reports: Facebook Facebook tops the technology industry diversity league tables, with a workforce made up of 33% women and 67% men. However, the figure is just 17% women in technical roles. The company points to a broader problem with education in the US, where only one in four high schools teach computer science. Apple Apple’s US workforce consists of 32% women as of June 2016, compared with 27.7% in 2014. Within technical roles, that figure is 23%. The company is slowly shifting the dial, with women accounting for 37% of new hires across all roles over the 12 months ending in June 2016. Google According to Google, 31% of its employees are female versus 69% male. However, only 19% of Google’s technical roles are held by women. Google says this is slowly changing with progressive hiring policies – 22% of new technical hires were women. Twitter It’s the same story for Twitter, whose staff is 70% male and 30% female across the board, but men account for 90% of technical roles. In August 2015, the company set goals to change the ratio by the end of 2016 to have 35% women across the company and 16% in technical roles. Microsoft Of Microsoft’s 116,000 employees, 73% are men and 27% are women as of 2015. As with Facebook, women make up only 17% of technical roles. Attempts to become more gender-balanced don’t seem to be working – the company had a higher proportion of female staff (29%) in 2014.

Business Market report: Bid war for chip designer piques City's Imagination Jamie Nimmo Tuesday 11 October 2016 11:22 BST Name in the frame: Samsung was named as a potential buyer of Imagination Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images Amid Samsung’s firefighting, Liberum analysts were fuelling speculation that smartphone chip designer Imagination Technologies might be a takeover target. Tech behemoth Apple, for which Imagination designs graphics chips, walked away from talks with Imagination in March. But the Takeover Panel’s rule which prevents companies from coming back to the table for six months has expired, leaving Apple free to reopen talks. The £24 billion takeover of chip-designer ARM Holdings by Japan’s SoftBank suggests Apple could face a scrap for Imagination, according to Liberum’s Janardan Menon. “We believe Imagination is an attractive and desirable acquisition target for a variety of companies in the broader technology sector,” the analyst said. He added that potential buyers include web giant Google, smartphone heavyweights Samsung and Huawei, and chip-makers Intel, Qualcomm, Spreadtrum, CEVA and  MediaTek. Tsinghua, which bought a stake in the company this year, was also named as a potential suitor. Menon suggested SoftBank’s pricey deal for ARM could be pave the way for more expensive takeovers. The speculation, along with higher forecasts on the back of stronger demand for the iPhone7 and a weaker sterling, boosted the shares by 16.75p, or 6.6%, to 271.75p — their highest level since 2013. The FTSE 100 flirted with record highs, up 11.29 points at 7108.79 — above its highest closing price by around five points, but just below the intra-day record. The market became more confident that struggling Pearson, up 8p at 820.5p, can avoid a profit warning when it reports on third-quarter trading next week. Investment bank Jefferies lent its support to the textbook publisher today, arguing that the shares look “cheap”. Victrex surged 129p, or 8%, to 1751p after a “good finish to 2016” for the high-performance plastics manufacturer’s car and plane parts business and a robust trading performance from its oil and gas division. Though the company said it was in line with expectations, JPMorgan said it was surprised Victrex managed to meet its targets. In a further sign that mining majors are turning their attentions back to junior explorers, Savannah Resources struck a new deal with Rio Tinto that will allow the pair to start work on their heavy minerals sands projects in Mozambique. Savannah rose 0.18p, or 4%, to 4.25p. Audioboom, which hosts a podcast show by comedian Romesh Ranganathan called Hip Hop Saved My Life, dipped 0.09p to 2.41p despite revealing that revenues in the third-quarter exceeded the total generated in the entire first six months of the year.

World-class performance. Surprisingly, not obscenely expensive. Tired Fan reaches ungodly loudness under load. Still beastly in size. Screen is chintzy and relatively low in resolution. Screen has some quality issues. Buy It Now   |  AVADirect How We Rate 1/10A complete failure in every way 2/10Sad, really 3/10Serious flaws; proceed with caution 4/10Downsides outweigh upsides 5/10Recommended with reservations 6/10Solid with some issues 7/10Very good, but not quite great 8/10Excellent, with room to kvetch 9/10Nearly flawless 10/10Metaphysical perfection At 7.8 pounds and more than a whopping 1.7 inches thick, this 15.6-inch laptop (1920 x 1080 resolution, no touchscreen) strains the limits of portability but sports the latest PC hardware. Inside you’ll find a sixth-generation Skylake Intel Core i5 CPU, 16 gigs of RAM, a 1TB traditional hard drive and a 256GB SSD, and a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 for the graphics. As impressive as those specs are, the P750GM2-G can support up to 64GB of RAM and a full hard drives of any type. A bevy of ports keeps you connected: three USB 3.0 ports, a USB 3.1 Gen 2 port, one USB 2.0 port, Ethernet, a Thunderbolt 3 port, two MiniDisplay ports, and an HDMI output. There’s an SD card reader too, but no optical drive, which apparently even gamers can now do without. But with all these plugs and ports, if you can’t find a way to hook up all your peripherals, it’s time to invest in a desktop. Machines like this are of course all about performance, and the P750GM2-G easily outscored every notebook I’ve tested. The machine beat every benchmark (gaming or mainstream), typically by 10 to 20 percent and sometimes more, and breezed through high-end gaming tests and rendering lifelike 3-D content. The screen lacks the resolution to properly test 4K content, but everything was seamless at its native 1080p. Although the screen offers ample brightness, some may decry the lack of 4K resolution. (Upgrade to 3840 x 2160 pixels for just $84.) That said, I did notice some brightness irregularities on the review unit, namely light leaking around the upper LCD bezel. It was quite noticeable in spots when the screen was supposed to be dark. Power User Most gaming rigs don’t have the battery life to get you much further than the distance from your house to the LAN party, but the AVA boasts 2.5 hours of run time. That’s surprising and impressive, though functionally the battery is limited to 2 hours and 15 minutes. Once it hits the last 10 percent, it emits a loud, shrill beep that overrides any Windows settings. Allow it to sound in public at your own risk; it’s the type of thing that might prompt someone to call security, thinking a bomb is about to blow. The fan is loud, too. The slightest load activates it, and it sounds like a jet taking off. It’s almost certainly necessary, given the high-end components, but that doesn’t make it right. When you can hear it over the fan, audio quality is loud and crisp. The touchpad is a smooth operator (including, oddly enough, a built-in fingerprint reader), but the keyboard is mushy and unsatisfying despite the brilliant backlighting. It’s interesting and instructive to consider this machine against the last AVADirect machine I reviewed, the P375SM that is now three years old. That ultra high-end rig has long held records across the board in my testing database, as one would expect from a $3,500 laptop. Since then, AVA has trimmed the chassis by nearly 2 pounds and half an inch while significantly boosting performance. And it cut the price in half—this test unit costs $1,870—putting gaming rigs like this within reach of the mass market. Nicely done. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

"The Perimeta virtualized SBC (vSBC) can easily replace legacy systems without sacrificing any functionality or performance while giving operators an easy and flexible way to deploy this advanced network function in their cloud," said Carsten Rossenhövel, EANTC's managing director. "Whether deployed to facilitate plain SIP traffic in a network or for complex call handling in VoLTE environments, we found that the Perimeta vSBC meets typical service provider performance requirements." The tests, commissioned by Intel® under the Intel Network Builders Program, included both call signaling and audio stream processing and evaluated Perimeta's ability to assist in troubleshooting and to provide high-availability clustering. The comparison between the virtualized and appliance-based capabilities included evaluations of both OpenStack and VMware-based deployments. In evaluating security characteristics, Perimeta was found to effectively limit call rates when overloaded, and also to maintain baseline call signaling performance when subjected to DDoS attacks. Test Highlights EANTC cited the following as a result of the tests: Consistent, identical functionality when compared to legacy Perimeta SBC appliances Highly valuable alarm, event logging and call analysis when used in conjunction with the Metaswitch Service Assurance Server (SAS) Stable performance and reliable operation in overload conditions Ability to handle as many as 700 signaled calls per second and 78,000 simultaneous media sessions with no measurable difference in terms of QoS for both signaling and media compared to appliance based SBCs Verification of high availability "We are extremely pleased with the results of the EANTC testing, which demonstrates yet again the superior performance of our leading Perimeta vSBC, as experienced by our growing customer base of global service providers in real-world deployments," said Micaela Giuhat, vice president of product management at Metaswitch. "The virtualized Perimeta SBC offers providers clear advantages over proprietary or legacy COTS-based deployments, decreasing the time to revenue and providing compelling cost savings."

Dell will introduce a convertible version of the XPS 13 with an edge-to-edge display in time for CES 2017, a Dell source tells PCMag. Unlike other convertibles on the market, the XPS 13 convertible will feature Dell's "InfinityEdge" design, which enables each side of the the display to extend to within millimeters of the bezel's edge. This design provides the illusion of a borderless screen that extends from corner to corner and side to side. The new unit will also feature Intel's Kaby Lake processor. The tricky part about designing a convertible with an edge-to-edge display is that when the device is used as a tablet, the edges and corners of the screen are typically the locations where users hold the device. Without some sort of tablet-mode software solution for this issue, users will accidentally click on links and buttons at the edges of the screen. Although our source said Dell would make the experience possible in a manner similar to how one navigates on a phone (e.g. touching the screen in one spot while scrolling up and down in another), the source declined to provide additional comment. For reference, last year's Dell XPS 13 Touch is our Editors' Choice for ultraportable laptops. It features a 13.3-inch, QHD+ (3,200-by-1,800-pixel), resolution screen. It weighs 2.85 pounds and it's just 0.6 inches thick. Dell will also refresh the Latitude 13 series with convertible form factors and InfinityEdge displays. As with the XPS 13, our source declined to offer specifics about the devices. The Latitude lineup, although similar in design to XPS models, are designed for business users. They typically come packed with software that enables mobile device managers to remote wipe devices and prevent malware attacks.

Not to tread too heavily on Apple’s toes on what would now be a 2-3-year-old product, Samsung is entering the market with a more consumer focused ‘ArtPC Pulse Premium Desktop’ in a cylindrical aluminium chassis. The PC is self-contained with an Intel 6th generation Core i5 or Core i7, and an AMD Radeon RX based graphics card. On the top is a harmon/kardon 360-degree omni-directional audio speaker. Preorders for both the Skylake-based Core i5 and Skylake-based Core i7 start from $1200 and $1600 from Amazon respectively. The exact CPU models have not been listed by either Samsung or Amazon as of yet, however it states the Core i5 is at 2.7 GHz, which is akin to the i5-6400 at 65W TDP or i5-6600T at 35W – the latter seeming more appropriate. For the Core i7, it is listed as 3.4 GHz, which would put it as the i7-6700, at 65W. Here’s the breakdown of the two systems, with the more expensive MSI Vortex G65 that has a full i7-6700K and dual GPUs: Specifications of Samsung ArtPC and MSI Vortex G65   ArtPC Pulse Desktop DP700C6A-A01US ArtPC Pulse Desktop DP700C6A-X01US MSI Vortex G65 SLI-011 CPU Intel Core i7-6600 4C/8T, 3.4 GHz 65W Intel Core i5, 2.4 GHz either i5-6400 (65W) or i5-6600T (35W) Intel Core i7-6700K 4C/8T 4.0 GHz PCH Unknown 100-series Intel Z170 RAM 16GB DDR4 Unknown Config 8GB DDR4 Unknown Config 4 SO-DIMM Slots 2 x 8 GB DDR4-2133 GPU AMD Radeon RX 460 2GB 2 x NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 3 GB SSD 256 GB NVMe 2 x 128 GB PCIe 3.0 x4 HDD 1TB HDD Unknown Form Factor - 1 TB HDD 7200 RPM LAN Unknown GbE 2x Killer E2400 WLAN ??

Otherwise no. 2 x DP 1.2 HDMI Yes, Unknown 2 x HDMI 1.4 Thunderbolt No 2 x TB3 via Type-C USB 4 x USB 3.0 4 x USB 3.0 1 x Type-C, Unknown Speed 2 x USB 3.1 via TB3 Dimensions 5.51 x 5.51 x 12.18-in 7.61 x 7.01 x 10.55-in Volume 6.06 liters 6.5 liter Weight 7.4 lbs (3.4 kg) 8.8 lbs (4.0 kg) Price Pre-order: $1600 Pre-order: $1200 $2199 We don’t have pictures of the internals, but one would assume that both systems would offer dual channel memory and Samsung NVMe drives, however it is unclear if these are user upgradable. The Core i5 is listed as having 8GB of DDR4 (probably DDR4-2133) and a 256GB NVMe SSD, whereas the Core i7 is listed as having 16GB of DDR4 and a 256GB NVMe SSD with another 1TB SATA HDD. It doesn’t state that the 1TB is mechanical, or a 2.5-inch drive, so until we can see the insides it is hard to tell. It is stated that the 1TB is a ‘module’ and users can add their own ‘modules’, but no further information is given. Both systems come with an AMD Radeon RX 460 graphics card, which we would assume would be the MXM version similarly used in notebooks, but in this case with 2GB of GPU memory. Clearly visible are four USB 3.0 ports, a USB Type-C port (unsure on the speed), a HDMI output, an Ethernet port, an SD card reader and a single headphone jack. For this price it seems a little strange not to see any front facing Thunderbolt 3 ports here, and given that there are harmon/karmon speakers fitted, and something more in the audio ports might be worthwhile. It would be interesting to get a breakdown and see which audio codec they’ve fitted for the headphone audio port, as well as the Ethernet port controller. A note about the speakers - the Amazon listing for these machines indicates that 3xAA batteries are required, which might mean for the speaker itself as a separate entity, or these machines might come with a remote control. The design is fairly minimal in design and measures 5.51 x 5.51 x 12.18 inches (13.9 x 13.9 x 30.9 cm) and uses the single central fan concept we’ve seen on a few other devices like the Mac Pro, the MSI Vortex and the GIGABYTE UHD Brix. The Samsung ArtPC is available for preorder today at $1200 and $1600 from Amazon, to be delivered on the 28th of October in the US.

POST A COMMENT 45 Comments View All Comments zmeul - Monday, October 10, 2016 - link it's that the front or the back? if it's the front, why is there the power plug and the ethernet port on the front?! if that's the back, why is the SD card reader, the headphone jack, the power button, the BT button and USB ports on the back? Reply lazarpandar - Monday, October 10, 2016 - link I'm willing to bet that that's the back. Reply close - Monday, October 10, 2016 - link I'm willing to bet that plenty of people now think that Apple invented the cylinder and Samsung is just copying... Reply HunterKlynn - Monday, October 10, 2016 - link Don't cut yourself on that edge, man. Reply BurntMyBacon - Tuesday, October 11, 2016 - link vFunct's comment below: "Can Samsung ever do anything besides copy Apple non-stop 100% of the time?" I'll leave the debate over whether the statement is valid or not to more interested parties, but it looks like your prediction was at least half correct. Reply fafan - Wednesday, October 12, 2016 - link You cannot blame Samsung that they only copy Apple 100%. Give them some credit man! They are original too! Samsung invented the Exploding Phone! Reply Nallaikkumaran - Saturday, October 15, 2016 - link Hello fafan. The idiots thinking apple invented Cylindrical PC. Apple Mac Pro copycat from SFF Cylindrical PC (2005). Apple is always copying from every brand. Apple is the founding father of copying.This article seems to lack research. Maybe you need to be educated a little more. Stop ur FAKE propaganda. In fact, Apple invented the Exploding Phone!. There are plenty of reports recently about iPhone 5, 6 and 7 explosions as well (2014-2016). But they are no news about that. Apple media (USA) are very good at masking Apple problems. Check out Google "iPhone fire" (100 news..). Reply jecs - Monday, October 17, 2016 - link I don't think the point has never been if Apple really invented something from "0" because nobody has ever done that and copying is no bad per se. Every master learned copying first. I think the point is at what level you copy an idea, if you improve over the original and if you added distinctive features to make it your own. If a company or person is too literal it is a copy if they add their very own flavor and functionality it is a valid design. I always used a Mac but also PCs and I don't mind or care if Samsung copied Apple's Mac Pro, what I observe is the HC speaker on top as I don't like it being permanent and even less running on batteries, and as many here I don't know if the connector panel make complete sense. Other than that I like the general concept. Also I don't think it is great to offer 9xx Nvidia options, I will asume 10xx series will be offered. Reply misan - Tuesday, October 18, 2016 - link Sign... the SFF computer was just a regular normal case which happened to be round. With the cylindrical Mac Pro, they have completely reorganised the inside of the case, using a central cooling tunnel with oversized fans and placing the components on its sides, with heatsinks facing inwards. The Mac Pro is first and foremost a novel cooling solution. I am not aware of anyone who did something like that before. So yes, Apple was first with it and then others started copying their design more or less 1-to-1. Reply bigboxes - Monday, October 10, 2016 - link Exactly what I was thinking. Stupid design.

Back To Top Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A CORSAIR Vengeance LPX DDR4 DRAM Desktop Memory Designed for High-Performance Overclocking on Intel X99 Motherboards Vengeance LPX memory is designed for high-performance overclocking. The heatspreader is made of pure aluminum for faster heat dissipation, and the eight-layer PCB helps manage heat and provides superior overclocking headroom. Each IC is individually screened for performance potential. The DDR4 form factor is optimized for the latest Intel X99 Series motherboards and offers higher frequencies, greater bandwidth, and lower power consumption than DDR3 modules. Vengeance LPX DDR4 modules are compatibility-tested across X99 Series motherboards for reliably fast performance. There's XMP 2.0 support for trouble-free automatic overclocking. And, they're available in multiple colors to match your motherboard, your components, or just your style. Compatibility Tested Across X99 Series Motherboards for Reliably Fast Performance Part of our exhaustive testing process includes performance and compatibility testing on most every X99 Series motherboard on the market – and a few that aren't. Designed for High-Performance Overclocking Each Vengeance LPX module is built from an eight-layer PCB and highly-screened memory ICs. The efficient heat spreader provides effective cooling to improve overclocking potential. Pure Aluminum Heat Spreader for Faster Heat Dissipation And Cooler Operation Overclocking overhead is limited by operating temperature. The unique design of the Vengeance LPX heat spreader optimally pulls heat away from the ICs and into your system's cooling path, so you can push it harder. The heat spreader doesn't just allow Vengeance LPX to run better… the aggressive yet refined form factor looks great in showcase systems. XMP 2.0 Support for Trouble-Free, Automatic Overclocking Manually pushing your DRAM frequency can be a fun experiment, but sometimes you just want to get maximum performance without the hassle. Intel X99-based motherboards support the new XMP 2.0 standard, and Vengeance LPX DRAM does, too. Turn it on, and it will automatically adjust to the fastest safe speed for your Vengeance LPX kit. You'll get amazing, reliable performance without lockups or other strange behavior. Low-Profile Design Fits in Smaller Spaces When the first Mini-ITX and Micro ATX motherboards for DDR4 are released, Vengeance LPX will be ready. The small form factor makes it ideal for smaller cases or any system where internal space is at a premium. Available in Multiple Colors to Match Your Motherboard or Your System The best high-performance systems look as good as they run. Vengeance LPX is available in several colors to match your motherboard, your other components, your case - or just your favorite color. Designed for Enthusiasts. Backed by Corsair.

News & Analysis IoT Consumer Groups Merge OCF, AllSeen blending app frameworks Rick Merritt 10/10/2016 12:55 PM EDT 2 comments NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. – Two groups with competing application frameworks for the consumer Internet of Things agreed to merge their approaches. The Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) and the AllSeen Alliance will unite under the OCF name and bylaws. The news paves the way to a common open-source framework that should provide the most viable alternative to smart home environments from Apple and Google. The two groups were operating as separate open-source projects managed by the Linux Foundation. Both have established, separate reference designs—Iotivity for OCF and AllJoyn for AllSeen. Although the combined group did not set specific dates for its work, it did sketch out its plans. As a first step, it will describe bridged, bidirectional support between the AllJoyn 16.04 and Iotivity 1.1 implementations, something AllJoyn largely demonstrated with its Device System Bridge, a representative said in an email exchange. In addition, it will integrate features such as introspection and advanced security management along with native remote access interfaces into a combined Iotivity roadmap. The united OCF group will maintain both reference designs and merge the best elements of both into one under the name Iotivity. The group pledged current Iotivity and AllJoyn devices will run on the new framework. The merger is the biggest step to date among a fragmented set of IoT application environments that have moved to greater collaboration and consolidation over the past year. It comes at a time of fierce competition between Apple with its HomeKit application framework and Google with its emerging Weave protocol. With the merger the OCF expanded its board of directors to include executives from AB Electrolux, CableLabs, Canon, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., GE Digital, Haier, Intel, LG Electronics, Inc., Microsoft, Qualcomm, Samsung Electronics, and Technicolor SA. Qualcomm led the formation of what became the AllSeen Alliance. The group’s technology is currently used in millions of AllJoyn-certified devices. Intel led the formation of OCF which announced its first specifications late last year. At that time OCF said its approach uses RESTful APIs in contrast to the AllSeen approach that uses remote procedure calls. As recently as the Consumer Electronics Show in January, the two groups seem set on competitive paths. However, a representative said over email that the groups have been exploring a path to interoperability since early this year. “The AllSeen Alliance and Open Connectivity Foundation have been working together closely to deliver a technologically comprehensive solution that makes sense for the industry and our members,” said Danny Lousberg, chairperson of the AllSeen Alliance, speaking in a press statement “As we forge onwards towards this shared goal, we are focused on building the most robust, open IoT software solution to achieve our vision – complete interoperability within the IoT,” said Mike Richmond, executive director, Open Connectivity Foundation. — Rick Merritt, Silicon Valley Bureau Chief, EE Times Related posts: Home Networks Try To Be Civil Consumers Not Excited About Connected Appliances Apple Expands in AI, Smart Home Who Is Dumber, You or Your Home?

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: AllSeen alliance merges with Open Connectivity Foundation to accelerate the IoT 0 by Pradeep  @pradeepviswav Oct 10, 2016 at 15:10 GMT1 month ago Back in February, Microsoft announced that they are joining other industry leaders to create the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF), a new standards body for IoT which is committed to furthering industry standards for the Internet of Things. Along with founding members Cisco, Electrolux, General Electric, Intel, Qualcomm, Samsung and others, Microsoft is claimed at that time that OCF is the world’s largest open IoT standard group. Today, Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) and AllSeen Alliance announced that the two organizations are merging  under the OCF name and bylaws. The newly merged groups will collaborate on future OCF specifications, as well as the IoTivity and AllJoyn open source projects. OCF will now sponsor both the IoTivity and AllJoyn open source projects at The Linux Foundation. Both projects will collaborate to support future versions of the OCF specification in a single IoTivity implementation that combines the best of both technologies into a unified solution. Current devices running on either AllJoyn or IoTivity solutions will be interoperable and backward-compatible. Companies already developing IoT solutions based on either technology can proceed with the confidence that their products will be compatible with the unified IoT standard that the industry has been asking for. The merger is designed to leverage the strengths of each organization. To this merger, the AllSeen Alliance brings its diverse, global membership, proven AllJoyn technology, and millions of AllJoyn-enabled products into the market through the AllJoyn Certified program. OCF brings its deep membership roster, formal IoT standards with expertise across multiple vertical markets and cloud-native architecture as implemented within the IoTivity framework.

In that vein, the company announced its new MobileStudio Pro tablet, which follows in the steps of the Cintiq Companion. While the Cintiq Companion only came in a 13.3-inch configuration, the MobileStudio Pro offers both 13.3-inch and 15.6-inch options, and is both thinner and lighter than its predecessor. the Pro Pen 2 offers 8,192 levels of sensitivity But given that this is a Wacom tablet, the most important parts are the pen and the screen, and the MobileStudio Pro improves on both of those areas. The screen now comes in 4K on the larger MobileStudio Pro 16 and 2K on the smaller MobileStudio Pro 13. Wacom has also updated the pen with the Pro Pen 2, which offers 8,192 levels of sensitivity — four times that of the Cintiq Companion — and unlike Apple’s Pencil or Microsoft’s Surface Pen, it doesn’t have batteries that need to be charged or replaced. Despite the tablet form factor, Wacom offers some fairly powerful options when it comes to specs, starting at $1,499 for a sixth-generation Intel i5 Skylake processor, 4GB of RAM, and a 64GB SSD on the 13.3-inch model, all the way up to a $2,999 top-of-the-line 15.6-inch configuration with an Intel i7 processor, 512GB SSD, 16GB of RAM, and a NVIDIA Quadro M1000M with 4GB of VRAM. Additionally, the maximum spec models of both sizes of the MobileStudio Pro also add an Intel RealSense 3D camera for 3D image capturing. the MobileStudio Pro tablets can also function as a monitor and pen interface Lastly, while the MobileStudio Pro tablets are standalone Windows 10 computers, they can still be connected like any of Wacom’s other tablets to another computer, where they can serve as a secondary monitor and pen interface. Both the MobileStudio Pro 13 and MobileStudio Pro 16 are expected to ship sometime in November.

Alienware introduces its first ever VR-ready notebooks. The new line of notebooks boasts the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 10-Series family of GPUs; desktop-class graphics performance comes to notebooks for enhanced capabilities and realistic gameplay. Alienware’s latest engineering advancements include the integration of new construction materials to improve thermal management for these new powerful components, as well as add durability and rigidity to the celebrated Alienware design aesthetic. “Gaming is in a time of renaissance right now; awesome games and development, amazing resolutions and technology, plus the pure excitement around VR experiences – it’s an incredible driving force and it feels similar to the energy that started Alienware 20 years ago,” said Frank Azor, general manager of Alienware and XPS at Dell. “These new notebooks are a product of that history and approach, but also of the demands and expectations of gamers today. Being true to both is what Alienware is about and we’re proud to bring these notebooks to gamers.” Engineered for Gamers Innovative engineering that focuses on gamers first is a hallmark of Alienware’s two-decade success in the industry. The demands for higher resolutions, more realistic gameplay and virtual reality usher in the need for more performance, and for Alienware, better design. The inventive integration of new materials such as anodised aluminium, magnesium alloy, steel reinforcement and copper add form and function to this new design. Adding copper to the unique thermal solution improves cooling capabilities across both CPU and GPU; combined with the new hinge-forward design, notebook ventilation can increase performance as most thermal dissipation flows up and out the rear. The all-new Alienware TactX keyboard introduces an optimised RGB LED for better key lighting, plus a full 2.2mm of gaming-grade travel that feels incredible, and is steel-reinforced for durability. Aluminium and magnesium alloy improve design quality and rigidity, while anti-smudge finishes add great utility to the aggressive new look of these notebooks. To improve audio output, a new speaker design includes internal smart-amps that monitor audio waveforms, enabling the use of the entire thermal margin of the speaker for stronger sound. This ground-up approach to design has helped address the stunning performance of cutting edge components and has even enabled these new notebooks to be thinner than their predecessors. Alienware 17 The new Alienware 17 is the ultimate gaming notebook with an emphasis on screen size, gaming performance and overall immersion. This flagship notebook gains more power with overclocked Intel Core i7 k-series processors and DDR4 memory running up to 2667MHz. Newly added support for optional IR Tobii eye-tracking technology adds great accessibility features based on where you’re looking. It allows gamers to fine tune their skills with a new Overwolf app that can replay your gaze pattern so gamers can track where they were looking during gameplay; gamers can then learn from their mistakes and be sure to focus their attention on the best opportunities to crush the competition. Tobii partnered with Alienware to add exclusive features including enhanced presence detection tied to our iconic AlienFX lighting zones; the full LED system illuminates and changes based on where you look. Only on Alienware will your Tobii camera detect your gaze, allow you to record and export your gaze pattern as a coaching tool to help improve your gameplay. It can also sense your presence and attention to understand when you engage with various elements of the device or lock your system when you walk away; these unique features help optimise power, performance and can improve security. Alienware 15 Balancing superior gaming performance with portability, the new mid-size Alienware 15 is for gamers that want the best of both. With more power in a thinner frame, it comes with great graphics options from AMD and NVIDIA, including the stunning, VR-ready NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060. Coming standard with a 15.6” FHD, IPS Anti-Glare, 300-nits display, additional options include FHD 120Hz display with NVIDIA G-Sync for incredibly smooth, synchronised frame rates and UHD IGZO for 4k resolutions. Built so gamers can be on the go, its exceptional battery life keeps it going with a 68 watt-hour lithium ion battery and an optional 99 watt-hour battery to enable extended gameplay when away from a plug.2 Alienware 13 The new Alienware 13 may be the brand’s smallest notebook, but with some big improvements. Configurable with NVIDIA GeForce GTX 10-Series graphics, this aggressive design will offer one of the most compact VR-ready devices ever. Whether gaming at high resolutions or in your own virtual world, trillions of LED lighting combinations through eight unique programmable lighting zones with up to 20 distinct colours deliver truly dazzling gameplay. Additional Gaming Options The Alienware Graphics Amplifier is designed to propel your mobile gameplay to warp speed as a plug-in companion to Alienware notebooks; small enough to slide into a standard carry case, yet powerful enough to transform mobile gaming, the Graphics Amp can be your quickest ticket to 4k gaming and beyond. Great for adding to your Graphics Amp or any Alienware device, Dell offers some of the best monitors in the world. The new Dell 24 Gaming Monitor (S2417DG) delivers sharp and clear QHD graphics and matches gamers’ speed of reaction with virtually no input lag at a 1 ms panel response time for the ultimate competitive edge. The Dell UltraSharp 34 Curved Monitor (U3417W) takes the benefits of curved, ultra-wide screens even further with a more immersive viewing experience; it is perfect for going deeper into gaming action with extended peripheral vision and 18W speakers for a cinematic experience. In addition, coming from Dell for gamers is the next generation Inspiron 15 notebook. This new and aggressively designed notebook offers gamers another option in equipping themselves for the game. With several gaming-focused features including higher screen resolution, discrete graphics, audio performance and memory capacity, gamers looking for a notebook solution have more options than ever from Dell. Availability The new Alienware 13, 15 and 17 systems will be configurable to your needs and available to order locally in February 2017 priced from R29,000. These new and updated solutions can all be found on the Alienware or Dell websites.

By Karen Tumbokon On 10/11/16 AT 6:34 PM Close Now that the PlayStation VR launch is imminent, every major VR headset will be available in the market. Each VR headset offers its own approach that to VR interactivity and hardware, consumers have a tough choice if they’re looking to buy a VR headset. To help you compare the differences between the Oculus Rift and PlayStation VR, we’ve compiled their prices, specs, software and setup.  PlayStation VR price: $399  To help you compare the differences between the Oculus Rift and PlayStation VR, we’ve compiled their prices, specs, and software. Photo: Sony PlayStation VR’s core package comes with the headset, a processing unit, and all of the necessary connection cables. Other accessories - the PlayStation Camera and Move controllers- must be purchased separately. Out of all of the VR headsets available, PlayStation VR is the only one designed to specifically work with the PS4. It supports everything from head tracking, controller tracking, and mobility tracking. You can also play non-VR games and watch movies with the headset. Sony’s PlayStation VR headset is set to launch on October 13th for $399. Oculus Rift price: $600 To help you compare the differences between the Oculus Rift and PlayStation VR, we’ve compiled their prices, specs, and software. Photo: Oculus The Oculus Rift is a $600 headset that only works for PC. However, it does come with an Xbox One controller, a sensor, and free copies of Lucky’s Tale and Eve: Valkyrie. The Oculus Rift features head tracking and controller tracking and supports a ton of games on the Oculus Home software distribution platform. PlayStation VR specs  When it comes to final hardware specs of Sony’s PlayStation VR headset, it sports a 5.7-inch OLED display running at a 120 Hz rate and has a total resolution of 1920 x 1080 at 960 x 1080 per eye. Sony says the field of view comes in at 100 degrees with latency at 18ms. The PlayStation VR also includes the Sixaxis gyroscope which is found in Sony’s game controllers, as well as a built-in microphone. Oculus Rift specs The first thing you’ll notice when you put on the Oculus Rift, is that you’re pretty aware of how the headset feels. It’s mostly comfortable, but the way it fits on your head can almost make it feel like a helmet. The Oculus Rift will feature custom optics and display. It will have two OLED screens (with a resolution of 2160x1200) with low latency so you don’t have to worry about blurry or visible pixels. PlayStation VR setup  When you first open the box, you’ll want to connect the Processor Unit to your PlayStation 4. This means you’ll need to swap the HDMI cable in your console, adding another HDMI cable and connecting the Processor Unit to a USB connection which is located on the front of the PS4. There’s a dongle with an HDMI port that plugs into the front of the processor Unit, which is where you need to plug in the VR headset. A controller box in the headset’s cable lets you turn on the power, mute the microphone, plug in headphones and adjust the volume.  If you want to use the PS VR, you’ll have to learn to cope with all of the cables. Oculus Rift setup  Before you can start using the Oculus Rift, you’ll need a Windows PC. If anything, you’ll need to have an Intel Core i5 5490 processor, 8GB of RAM and a NVIDIA GTX 970 or AMD Radeon 290 video card. Once you have a capable rig, it won’t be long before you get the Oculus Rift up and running. From there, plug the Oculus Rift headset into a USB 3.0 port and HDMI port on your video card, and then insert the sensor’s cable into a separate USB 3.0 port and you’ll be on your way. You may also have to install some video card updates before you get started. PlayStation VR software  In addition to the PlayStation 4, you’ll need Sony’s PlayStation Camera. To get the full gaming experience, you’ll want to get the PlayStation Move controllers. Paired with the PlayStation Camera, you will be able to track the position of your hands so you can easily pick up virtual objects. Related Stories Best Games For Sony's PlayStation VR Everything You Need To Know About PlayStation VR Oculus Rift software  When you get the Oculus Rift, you’ll also get the sensor with a desk stand, a small Oculus remote and an Xbox One controller and wireless adapter. While there aren’t any motion controllers yet, that doesn’t mean we won’t see them. The Xbox One Controller is pretty much the same as the one that comes with the Microsoft console, and you’ll be using it as your main gaming controller. You will use the Oculus remote to navigate the apps, while wearing the headset, and you can control the headphone volume. According to the price listed on the Oculus VR website, a Rift and a VR-ready PC could cost $1,100. With the Touch controllers priced at $200, and a third sensor for room-scale experience at $79, the whole Oculus Rift experience can be bought for a little under $1,400. Oculus Rift vs. PlayStation Vr: Conclusion  While Sony delivered a pretty solid VR headset that is cheaper than the Oculus Rift, the Rift allows you to experience games in a way that you’ve only dreamed of up unit now. When it comes to which gaming VR headset is better, we have yet to make that decision. Even if one has a better “feel” than the other,  it really comes down to which VR gaming headset offers the best available games, apps and gaming experience. We’ll know which one is the best gaming VR headset very soon. Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

The struggling chip company's stock is riding a wave of optimism, but are profits on the way? Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Oct 11, 2016 at 6:00PM Image source: AMD. With shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) near their highest level in years, it can be easy to forget that the company is still unprofitable. In 2015, AMD posted a whopping $660 million net loss, its fourth annual net loss in a row. The situation has improved this year, with AMD managing to squeeze out a non-GAAP operating profit during the second quarter. But a return to true profitability remains elusive. What will it take for AMD to turn a profit? Revenue, and lots of it. Cost-cutting isn't enough AMD's revenue tumbled 27.5% in 2015, driven by sluggish demand for PCs and share losses to NVIDIA in the GPU market. Through the first six months of 2016, AMD has produced $1.86 billion of revenue, down from $1.97 billion during the same period last year. Cost-cutting has helped keep operating losses in check despite the lower revenue, but increasing sales is the only path to sustainable profitability. One thing that has acted as a barrier to profitability for AMD is its debt load. During the first six months of 2016, AMD paid $81 million in interest on about $2.2 billion of debt. In 2015, interest payments ate up 4% of revenue, meaning that the company would have needed to deliver an operating margin of 4% just to break even after interest. The good news for AMD is that its recently announced stock and convertible note sale, which is expected to raise more than $1 billion in total, will allow the company to pay down some of its debt and reduce its annual interest obligations. The surge in the stock price this year created an opening for AMD to raise cash, and the company took full advantage. This alone won't be enough to propel the company back to profitability, but it's a good move nonetheless. More revenue is coming AMD expects to grow total revenue by a low-single-digit percentage this year, but that won't be enough to return the company to profitability. Over the next few years, a few things will need to go right for AMD in order for the company to bring in enough revenue to pull the bottom line back into the black. First, AMD's semi-custom business will need to secure sufficient revenue beyond gaming consoles. Both the number of consoles sold and the amount of revenue AMD receives per console will decline as this generation matures, creating a hole that the company will need to fill. AMD has already announced three design wins -- one of which is Microsoft's Project Scorpio console -- that are expected to bring in a total of $1.5 billion over the next three to four years. That's a good start, but AMD will need to keep winning deals in order to drive meaningful growth in the long run. Second, AMD will need to win back graphics market share from NVIDIA. The company has already launched its mainstream Polaris graphics cards, and with NVIDIA mainly focused on the high end, there's a good chance that AMD is picking up mainstream customers. How much additional revenue this will create remains unclear, though. We'll need to wait until AMD reports its third-quarter results later this month to find out. Third, AMD's upcoming Zen CPUs, set to launch next year for PCs and servers, will need to find a way to claw back market share from Intel. As long as Zen proves competitive, AMD has a decent shot at making progress. Intel has slowed the pace at which it moves to new manufacturing processes, meaning that the manufacturing gap between Intel and AMD will be narrower than it's been in quite some time. As long as Zen doesn't fail to live up to expectations, AMD has a good chance at winning back at least some market share. If things go right for AMD, the company could conceivably return to profitability next year or in 2018. But an important follow-up question is this: Can AMD produce enough profits to justify its soaring stock price? With a market capitalization of around $5.4 billion, AMD will likely need to sustainably produce a few hundred million dollars of profit annually to keep its stock afloat. AMD has done it before, but the good times have never lasted for more than a few years. Will this time be different? Only time will tell. Timothy Green has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Baca / Journal Staff Writer Tuesday, October 11th, 2016 at 3:40pm .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... Gov. Susana Martinez, left, and Rachel Peterson, Facebook director of data center strategy and development, wield blue shovels during the company’s groundbreaking ceremony in Los Lunas on Tuesday. (ADOLPHE PIERRE-LOUIS/JOURNAL) LOS LUNAS — With a rousing chorus of “three, two, one, Facebook!,” New Mexico officials and representatives from the social media giant broke ground on Facebook’s new data center in Los Lunas. “This is a big win for our state and the community here,” said Gov. Susana Martinez, wielding a hard hat and shovel in the company’s signature blue. Proponents have called the project important to the state’s economic recovery. Critics have said the 30 to 50 jobs the data center will provide aren’t worth the tax incentive package New Mexico promised to Facebook. Los Lunas has promised Facebook a property tax break through $30 billion in industrial revenue bonds, a gross receipts tax reimbursement of up to $1.6 million annually and $10 million in Local Development Act funding. The state also will offer the company access to $3 million in Job Training Incentive Program money, although it is unclear how much of the money Facebook will use. Advertisement Continue reading The data center is certainly the largest capital investment in the state in recent memory: $250 million in its initial phase alone, dwarfed only by Intel’s $1.8 billion Rio Rancho expansion in 1993. Martinez said the state completed an extensive economic analysis of the deal during the process of courting Facebook to New Mexico, and that she is confident the company’s impact on the economy will last long past the inevitable construction boom that will occur while the data center is being built. “Facebook has had a positive impact on every location they’ve been in,” she said. “The same will be true here.” Rachel Peterson, director of data center strategy and development at Facebook, said the company felt that of all the potential it looked at — including West Jordan, Utah, which was the other final contender for the project — Los Lunas was the best fit in terms of access to construction labor, ability to accommodate the data center’s infrastructure, and response from the local community. “We couldn’t be more excited to be here,” said Peterson.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Rick Maese October 11 Follow @RickMaese Ted Leonsis speaks earlier this year during an interview in New York. (Photo by Chris Goodney/Bloomberg) Ted Leonsis is no stranger to politics. He once served as mayor of Orchid, Fla. When he first moved to Washington, he worked as an intern for his local congressman. And as he has built his business portfolio — which includes the Washington Wizards, Capitals, among many other entities — he has contributed to a variety of political campaigns, including the presidential bids of George W. Bush, John Kerry, Rudy Giuliani, Barack Obama and even Bill Bradley. But he’s never dipped his toes into the political waters quite like this. Leonsis is hosting a political fundraiser for Hillary Clinton on Friday at his Potomac home, where guests will pay up to $25,000 for an “intimate performance” from James Taylor. “I always stayed above the fray,” Leonsis said in an interview Tuesday. “But this time, there was one compelling issue for me, and it had to do with my heritage.” Leonsis, 59, said when immigration became such a divisive and volatile topic of this election, he felt he had to do more than cut a check. He explained that his grandparents immigrated here from Greece, changing the family name from Leoutsakos to Leonsis. “They were immigrants, but they essentially were refugees,” Leonsis said. “The Yugoslavs and the Turks were overrunning Greece and they left with everything they had in a trunk and took a steamer to New York.” His grandparents settled in Lowell, Mass., working in mills, and his parents eventually found their way to Brooklyn, where Leonsis was born. When Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, began routinely talking on the campaign trail about building a wall along the Mexico border or banning Muslims or refugees, Leonsis couldn’t help but think of his own family background. “All I could think of was, imagine if we had a president back then who said, ‘No you can’t come in,’” Leonsis said. “It really bothered me.” Leonsis says there’s another side of the issue that’s important to consider. Leonsis made his name in the technology world, as an executive at AOL and as an investor in many successful startups. “Most of the great tech companies have some kind of immigrant, entrepreneurial, start-up feel about them,” he said. “Intel, Apple — Steve Jobs’ father was an immigrant. Google, now Alphabet – the founder, Sergey Brin, his father was a Russian immigrant. So the wealth, the jobs, the technology that’s created by immigrants – and we’re an immigrant nation, a start-up nation. “So that one issue to me, I said, I have to work to make sure that we’re welcoming, that we have a place for the next Sergey Brin. Could you imagine putting a putting a wall up and stopping people from coming in? The unintended consequence of that to me was damning. So on this one, I said, ‘I’ll help all I can.’” Leonsis publicly endorsed Clinton’s bid of the White House in June. He said he has met the former Secretary of State and is friendly with the candidate and former President Bill Clinton, but Friday’s fundraiser isn’t a personal favor as much as a chance to have a positive impact on next month’s election.   sports dc-sports-bog Get the top Olympics news by email Major news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox as it happens. post_newsletter333 magnet-olympics2016 true endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

(+video) Can a crowdfunded telescope find an Earth-like planet? Ada Lovelace was a 19th-century English mathematician and writer, today widely celebrated as the world's first computer programmer. By Christina Beck, Staff October 11, 2016 Save for later Saved The daughter of famed poet Lord Byron, Ada Lovelace was born in London on December 10, 1815. View Caption About video ads View Caption of Computer programmers and technology enthusiasts, rejoice! Tuesday, Oct. 11 is Ada Lovelace Day, a day commemorating the woman known as the world’s first female computer programmer. While Ms. Lovelace lived long before the advent of computers as we know them today, she was a talented and well read mathematician who worked with Charles Babbage in the 19th century to create the analytical engine, commonly considered the precursor to modern programming. In 2009, activists instituted Ada Lovelace Day to commemorate the life of this incredible woman, and to celebrate women involved in technology, engineering, and scientific fields, where they are often still underrepresented. Recommended: From Grace Hopper to Ada Lovelace: women who revolutionized computer science “We hope that by taking part in Ada Lovelace Day, people will learn about the amazing achievements of our unsung heroines,” says the day’s founder, journalist and software activist Suw Charman-Anderson. “Many of our most successful women have never been given the credit they deserve, overshadowed by the men that they worked with for no better reason than that it was just “ how things were.” From Grace Hopper to Ada Lovelace: women who revolutionized computer science Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/15 Ms. Charman-Anderson says that despite recent advances, many women and their contributions still remain unrecognized. Born the daughter of famed British poet Lord Byron in 1815, Ada Lovelace’s understanding of computing bridged the gap from mere calculators to machines that were much closer modern computers, according to Lovelace researcher Walter Isaacson. Yet, despite her contributions to the field, Lovelace was largely forgotten until several decades ago, according to CNET. And she’s not the only one. In 1946, six women helped to program ENIAC, the first programmable computer, but were not introduced to the press. Two decades later, three black female mathematicians helped NASA send a man to space (a soon-to-be-released movie titled, "Hidden Figures."). They too were also not recognized. Ms. Charman-Anderson told the Guardian that despite diversity efforts, and a million dollars in spending, by tech giants such as Apple and Intel, men and women are not yet being hired in equal numbers in Silicon Valley. In fact, she says, many companies have fewer than 20 percent women in tech roles. Facebook, for example, has just 17 percent women in technology based roles, while Twitter has just 10 percent. Why are tech companies best efforts not working? Many corporations have mentorship programs for women, but Charman-Anderson says that more must be done to counter the problems that women face in tech. “Women leave tech for a variety of reasons, such as not seeing opportunities for advancement, hostile male culture, feelings of isolation – it’s not that they want to leave to have a family, as is often assumed,” she tells the Guardian. Tech companies also say that it can be hard to find women to hire. Facebook says that with just one in four US high schools teaching computer science, it can be difficult to procure applicants. On Ada Lovelace Day, Charman-Anderson and other tech activists hope to make STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields more accessible and visible to young girls who might be interested in a tech- or math-based career. Around the world events are planned to celebrate Lovelace and other female programmers, mathematicians, and scientists through talks and events by leaders in STEM fields. The day’s flagship event will be held in London, and headlined by female engineers, physicists, and climate scientists. “I would be delighted if we achieved true equality and ALD [Ada Lovelace Day] was no longer needed,” Charman-Anderson says. But for now: “We hope that mothers and fathers and teachers will find inspiration to pass on to their children and students, even finding inspiration themselves. And we hope that young girls will see that it’s not just OK to love science, tech, engineering and maths, but that there are real opportunities for them, at school, at university, and at work.” Next up From Grace Hopper to Ada Lovelace: women who revolutionized computer science Nobel Prize: What will it take to have more women as winners in science?

Powerful effects and editing tools. Face recognition. Tutorials. Good assortment of vector drawing tools. Cons Some operations still slow. Interface can get cluttered. Ineffective chromatic aberration removal. Bottom Line Corel PaintShop Pro continues to add new photo-editing possibilities in a worthy Photoshop alternative at a value-conscious price. By Michael Muchmore Corel's PaintShop Pro has long been the best-known inexpensive alternative to Adobe's category-leading—but pricey—Photoshop photo-editing software. PaintShop Pro offers a surprising array of image-editing tools, from basic photo correction to drawing to layer-based editing and content-aware object manipulation. And though Photoshop continues to lead the market with mind-blowing new tools continually appearing in updates, the Corel competitor is also always introducing new features, many of which can hold their own against Adobe. In at least one case—support for XDM depth-enabled photos—PaintShop has beat Photoshop to the punch. The latest version also adds a new screenshot tool, interactive gradient fill, prefab project templates, and support for Windows pressure-sensitive styluses. //Compare Similar Products Compare Adobe Photoshop Elements   %displayPrice%%seller% see it ACDSee 19   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Adobe Photoshop CC   %displayPrice%%seller% see it GIMP 2.6.1   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Pricing and Starting Up PaintShop Pro X9 is available directly from Corel for $79.99 (or $59.99 as an upgrade from any previous version). The Ultimate edition ($99.99/$79.99) throws in more software—AfterShot (Corel's photo workflow app), Perfectly Clear (an excellent automatic photo corrector), and Live Screen Capture (for screen recording). The one-shot pricing model may be a good fit for those who resent Adobe's subscription-only model for Photoshop. Lightroom, however, is still available for a one-time payment, though that option is hard to find on Adobe's site. PaintShop runs on Windows 7 through Windows 10. The installer is a 173MB download, and I had to install an update immediately after installation. Corel offers downloadable effect packs, too, such as ParticleShop brushes and ColorScript color effects ($14.99 and $4.99, respectively). I installed PaintShop Pro on my test PC, a 4K touch-screen Asus Zen AiO Pro Z240IC all-in-one PC. Happily, the program supports 4K monitors; some programs show ridiculously small icons on them, but apps that do support this high resolution reward you with supersharp images. View All 15 Photos in Gallery Interface Since my last review, Corel has spiffed up the interface and added learning and help windows right on first run. These were particularly helpful with the new features, such as project templates, screenshots, and gradients. They also help in familiarizing you with the three-mode workspace. Even after you dismiss the tutorial window, as in Lightroom, a series of dialog boxes take you through the interface components in a Guided Tour. That's also a great help in getting you started. There are just three modes: Manage, Adjust, and Edit. Unlike Adobe Photoshop Elements, which has a separate Organizer app, you do everything in PaintShop in the same window, but you switch among these modes for the different functions. Within Manage there are sub-views, like Maps and People Finder, and the first time you switch to a new mode, you get another tour. The program includes sample images, so you're not starting from zero. And if all that's not enough, the Edit mode still includes the right-panel Learning Center, which helps with lots of image-editing procedures. The main window's side panels can be undocked or dismissed. But the interface as a whole doesn't accommodate touch input, like that offered by my test machine. Photoshop Elements is better in this regard. Manage As its name suggests, this is where you organize your photo collection. Like Photoshop, PaintShop is not a photo workflow application, even though it includes tools for organizing and outputting. It's especially evident when importing photos because you don't get to preview or tag images on import. There's no big Import button as you find in workflow apps such as Adobe Lightroom. I had no trouble importing raw camera files, even from fairly new models like the Nikon D3400. After importing images, you can add star ratings, as well as tags for keywords, people, and places. You can also create collections, including Smart Collections of photos that meet specified criteria, such as date, name, or tags. Smart Collections let you specify criteria, such as text in the file name or image size to automatically create a Collection. On the left panel is source navigation, with folders and collections, in the center is your content view—thumbnails, full image view, or even a map mode. You can double tap a thumb for a quick full-screen preview with options for rating, rotating, deleting, or launching the image in the editor. Images aren't overwritten when you save edits, but saved in PaintShop's own PSP format. You can also save in Adobe PSD format, along with dozens of other standard image formats. Adjust Adjust mode shows a histogram with lighting and color controls in the left panel. Its helpful and effective Suggest Settings button corrected lighting problems in many of my test photos. You can click a neutral spot to correct the white balance and use a Levels slider to balance a lopsided histogram. A slider lets you zoom in or out to any magnification you choose, unlike Lightroom, which restricts you to set ratios like 1:2, 1:3, and 1:1. There is a 1:1 button in PaintShop, however, and you can zoom in and out simply by spinning the mouse wheel. One missing feature is a before and after view to show the results of your adjustments and edits. I do, however, appreciate the Revert button at the bottom of the corrections panel: There are certainly times when you've adjusted a photo excessively and just want to start over. Back and Forward buttons also help with this. On a right panel in Adjust mode are a panoply of Instagram-like Instant Effects. Double-clicking any of the effect preview thumbnails applies it, and you can combine two or more. There are lots and lots of effects—Artistic, Film, B&W, scene lighting—but their thumbnails use sample images instead of the one you're working on, which I'd prefer. Clicking on an effect, however, shows a preview of the selected effect in a larger thumbnail up top using your own image. Another gap is the lack of control over the effects. Sometimes you want to tone it down a bit, as I found with the Instant Film effect. Photoshop Elements' instant effects are indeed adjustable, but PaintShop's aren't. Of course, you could fuss with the image using the app's other adjustments for lighting and color, but it's nice to have a slider that simply controls the effect's strength, as even Instagram does. Luckily, there are also Undo and Redo buttons, since applying effects can get messy. Another help is the big Revert button, in case things have gotten completely out of hand and you want to start over. Edit Once you move into Edit mode, the full assortment of tools comes into play. Just as in Photoshop, you can add layers, manipulate grouped objects, and adjust curves and levels. The Curves tool is particularly powerful, allowing up to 16 control points, which let me create some pretty crazy effects by itself. The Retro lab makes up for Instant Effects' lack of adjustability in a big way. It lets you adjust blur, diffuse, glow, color, and more. Two selection tools, Smart Selection and Auto Selection, are similar to Photoshop's magic wand. The first did a decent job of letting me brush to create an edge-detected selection. But the Auto Selection is more impressive. You draw a box, and the tool selects an object inside it. In my testing, this only worked with very uniform backgrounds (a clear sky, for example) and objects with well-defined edges. Still, it's a useful tool for plucking a head off and using it against a different background. In the right circumstances it works quite well. Content-aware object removal and moving is a fairly recent addition. This lets you improve composition by moving or removing an object within a photo, often a human, while maintaining the background. For removal, you have to select some background to replace the object with, so it's not as automatic as the equivalent tool in Adobe Photoshop Elements. Camera Raw Lab When you start Edit mode with a raw camera file loaded, PaintShop opens the Lab interface, which is a lot like Photoshop's equivalent window. Here you can change the white balance and recover highlights, but also apply Lens-profile-based corrections for chromatic aberration and vignetting. I find it a little strange that this doesn't open when you go to Adjust mode, since what it offers are basically adjustments. Another, more significant, dig is that the adjustments in this part of the program are quite slow, especially compared with their more-effective equivalents in Lightroom. The Lab didn't identify my test camera (a very cool and expensive Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX1R II) automatically, even though its metadata was shown in the main program window. It did recognize a Canon 6D with a 24-105 zoom lens. But for both, when I chose to fix the chromatic aberration, I didn't see any improvement in purple and green fringing. You're much better off with Lightroom or DxO Optics Pro for this kind of fix. I tried again with a Canon Rebel T3i, a well-established model, and though the camera was recognized, the automatic fixes actually made the edge image geometry worse, warping objects. New Features Project Templates. PaintShop's templates are a boon to non-artistic folk who just need to create a card, collage, or brochure. They're really just predesigned layer groups, into which you drag your own images. The downside is that many cost a few bucks, though others are free. Gradient Fill. This tool lets you create customized gradients like the one below. It's not completely automatic, since you have to create a layer if you want to superimpose your gradient on an image. You can change the color and style from the Materials panel, and adjust the angle and transition area with handles on the line shown in the image preview window. Screen Capture. I usually use Snagit for my screen capturing, but I'm open to new options, since that program's recent versions have gone off track. Corel's does let you use a hotkey and a timer delay, which I consider essential, but unlike SnagIt's, it doesn't work any time in the background: You have to open the program and tell it to prepare to take the screenshot. It does offer several capture styles, including one that lets you select the rectangular area you want to shoot with the mouse I prefer a separate screenshot tool, but if you want to start editing right away, PaintShop's feature does the job. Depth-Aware Photo Support. I used sample photos with XDM depth information from Intel's Developer Zone site. PaintShop's Adjust mode includes a Depth Selection section that lets you specify the depth you want visible. This is equivalent to getting a green-screen mask without needing a green screen. You get a slider labeled from Near to Far. If the selected area doesn't suit your needs, a manual selection tool is right below the auto-distance-based selection slider. I actually needed this, because the automatic selection was (surprisingly) off in places. Windows Stylus. Corel claims that the new version of PaintShop Pro supports Windows Real-Time Stylus (WinRTS) devices, such as the pen that comes with the Surface line of convertible PCs. I tested this on a Surface Book, and indeed I was able to draw, complete with pressure sensitivity. You can also use the pen for any menus and settings. As mentioned, though, the interface isn't well-adapted to touchscreen input, with some pretty small controls. Output and Sharing From Edit mode's File menu, you can export to all the expected formats; JPEG, GIF, and PNG optimizers and an image slicer are useful extras for Web producers. Printing options abound, too, with CMYK separations, and standard layout presets. It even offers soft-proofing with a wide variety of printer profiles in the Color Management settings. For Web sharing, PaintShop can upload directly to Flickr and Facebook. A couple more choices like Twitter and Tumblr would be nice (Instagram, too, but that service only allows mobile uploading). One cool thing about the app's Web sharing dialog is that you can select more than one of these sites for multiple uploading. You can also choose whether to upload the full-size originals or reduced-size versions for easier transmission. A downside is that I couldn't just share to my Facebook wall or Flickr photo stream. Instead, I had to choose or create an album. And forget about syncing edits with the online album versions or viewing online comments, as you can with Photoshop Elements. A Fully Stocked Shop Corel PaintShop Pro is a high-bang-for-the-buck Photoshop substitute. The app gets points for the sheer number of tools it throws at you, many of which acceptably mimic their Photoshop counterparts—that even goes for advanced tools like content-aware move, gradients, and effect filters. For photographers less interested in visual arts and crafts, the $149 Lightroom is a better choice, making the workflow from memory card to output smoother. And the $99 Adobe Photoshop Elements, our Editors' Choice for enthusiast photo software, still offers a more intuitive interface, better performance, and Adobe's unmatched photo-manipulation tools.

In a past post, I tested Docker network. The MySQL Server team provided their own results, which are in line with my observations. For this set of tests, I wanted to focus more on Docker networking using multiple hosts. Mostly because when we set up a high availability (HA) environment (using Percona XtraDB Cluster, for example) the expectation is that instances are running on different hosts. Another reason for this test is that Docker recently announced the 1.12 release, which supports Swarm Mode. Swarm Mode is quite interesting by itself — with this release, Docker targets going deeper on Orchestration deployments in order to compete with Kubernetes and Apache Mesos. I would say Swarm Mode is still rough around the edges (expected for a first release), but I am sure Docker will polish this feature in the next few releases. Swarm Mode also expects that you run services on different physical hosts, and services are communicated over Docker network. I wanted to see how much of a performance hit we get when we run over Docker network on multiple hosts. Network performance is especially important for clustering setups like Percona XtraDB Cluster and  MySQL Group Replication (which just put out another Lab release). For my setup, I used two physical servers connected over a 10GB network. Both servers use 56 cores total of Intel CPUs. Sysbench setup: data fits into memory, and I will only use primary key lookups. Testing over the network gives the worst case scenario for network round trips, but it also gives a good visibility on performance impacts. The following are options for Docker network: No Docker containers (marked as “direct” in the following results) Docker container uses “host” network (marked as “host”) Docker container uses “bridge” network, where service port exposed via port forwarding (marked as “bridge”) Docker container uses “overlay” network, both client and server are started in containers connected via overlay network (marked as “overlay” in the results). For “overlay” network it is possible to use third-party plugins, with different implementation of the network, the most known are: Calico network https://github.com/projectcalico/calico-containers Weave network https://github.com/weaveworks/weave For multi-host networking setup, only “overlay” (and plugins implementations) are feasible. I used “direct”, “host” and “bridge” only for the reference and as a comparison to measure the overhead of overlay implementations. The results I observed are: Client Server Throughput, tps Ratio to “direct-direct” Direct Direct 282780 1.0 Direct Host 280622 0.99 Direct Bridge 250104 0.88 Bridge Bridge 235052 0.83 overlay overlay 120503 0.43 Calico overlay Calico overlay 246202 0.87 Weave overlay Weave overlay 11554 0.044   Observations “Bridge” network added overhead, about 12%, which is in line with my previous benchmark. I wonder, however, if this is Docker overhead or just the Linux implementation of bridge networks. Docker should be using the setup that I described in Running Percona XtraDB Cluster nodes with Linux Network namespaces on the same host, and I suspect that the Linux network namespaces and bridges add overhead. I need to do more testing to verify. Native “Overlay” Docker network struggled from performance problems. I observed issues with ksoftirq using 100% of one CPU core, and I see similar reports. It seems that network interruptions in Docker “overlay” are not distributed properly across multiple CPUs. This is not the case with the “direct” and “bridge” configuration. I believe this is a problem with the Docker “overlay” network (hopefully, it will eventually be fixed). Weave network showed absolutely terrible results. I see a lot of CPU allocated to “weave” containers, so I think there are serious scalability issues in their implementation. Calico plugin showed the best result for multi-host containers, even better than “bridge-bridge” network setup Conclusion If you need to use Docker “overlay” network — which is a requirement if you are looking to deploy a multi-host environment or use Docker Swarm mode — I recommend you consider using the Calico network plugin for Docker. Native Docker “overlay” network can be used for prototype or quick testing cases, but at this moment it shows performance problems on high-end hardware.   PREVIOUS POST NEXT POST Related Vadim Tkachenko Vadim Tkachenko co-founded Percona in 2006 and serves as its Chief Technology Officer.

This option is not on by default. Rather you specify it as a driver option when you create the network. I believe the option is called ‘encrypted’ according to this blog: https://blog.docker.com/2016/07/docker-built-in-orchestration-ready-for-production-docker-1-12-goes-ga/ I would be interested in seeing the relative performance of enabling encryption at a low level rather than at the app level. Could you rerun your benchmark against an overlay network with encryption enabled? Reply Vincent Bernat says: August 4, 2016 at 3:00 am Docker overlay network uses VXLAN in unicast mode. Therefore, most of the work is done inside the kernel. Your kernel version is therefore a crucial information (but I don’t know if improvements have been made since its introduction in the kernel). Also, being an encapsulation technology, you’ll get better performance by lowering the MTU and using TCP MSS. Maybe Docker does that for you, but it’s worth a check. Reply Vadim Tkachenko says: August 4, 2016 at 3:21 am Vincent, That’s a valid request. I am using kernel Linux 4.4.0-31-generic #50-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jul 13 00:07:12 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux from Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS Reply Madhu says: August 9, 2016 at 9:32 am I suspect the MTU setting as well. By default overlay driver uses 1450 & hence any traffic with larger packet size will result in frag & reassembly. In docker 1.12, driver mtu can be set per network during network creation via -o com.docker.network.driver.mtu=XXXX flag which will be used by the overlay driver to setup appropriate MTU for east-west traffic. If the measurement is done for north-south traffic (via default_gwbridge bridge), then the above driver option should also be used to create this default_gwbridge network manually. More information can be found under : https://github.com/docker/libnetwork/issues/1021 Reply Madhu says: August 11, 2016 at 2:35 pm Ofcourse its easier to try traffic with size < 1450 to confirm the performance bottleneck Reply Muayyad Alsadi says: August 5, 2016 at 9:28 am Can we add the following to the matrix coreos flannel (used by kuberntes) And ovs with vxlan (where each container is attached to ovs directly) And ovs attached to linux bridge which is attached to container. Reply sargund says: August 7, 2016 at 8:57 pm Do you have this benchmark automated? I would love to experiment with my patchset which gives some of the same features, and functions as Docker bridge, but without the same overhead. If you’re interested in trying it out, let me know. Reply Vadim Tkachenko says: August 8, 2016 at 1:39 pm I do not have scripts automated, you need to run something like ./sysbench --test=tests/db/select.lua --oltp_tables_count=20 --oltp_table_size=5000000 --num-threads=100 --mysql-host=$HOST --mysql-user=sbtest --oltp-read-only=on --max-time=300 --max-requests=0 --report-interval=10 --rand-type=uniform --rand-init=on run Do not forget to prepare (load data) before tests. Reply Alexander Holbreich (@aHolbreich) says: October 11, 2016 at 2:24 pm thank you. Do you have any insight to latency of small requests? In my case it’s more about them.

Awaken your ancient computer with new parts Creative Tech 0  Updated at 11:45 am, October 11th, 2016 By: Robert Patten, EastIdahoNews.com Share This Story We Matched An otherwise useless HP Compaq DC5000 is now the ‘Netflix computer’ in my house, thanks to added hardware. The white box converts the computer’s VGA output to a signal the old TV can understand. No HDMI cable needed. The speakers are hiding behind the TV. | Robert Patten, EastIdahoNews.com You are determined to make your old PC live again — and not just live, but thrive. Restoring your undead computer’s glory through upgraded hardware can be thrilling and can give you a taste of how Dr. Frankenstein must have felt. But with wires, circuit boards, chips, stickers with stern warnings about warranties and electrocution, and hopefully no rodents, messing with hardware can be intimidating. Undead Computer Month For October, Creative Tech is about raising your seemingly lifeless computers. Give your undead computer new life – Why restore an old computer anyway? Exorcise Windows from your old computer – Chances are, your outdated version of Windows won’t cut it, but there are free options out there. Treat your formerly undead computer – You have updated your hardware and operating system … but what software can you actually use on your ancient machine? If you want to make your old computer more capable, chances are you’re going to have to break out your screwdriver and get to work. Don’t be intimidated, though — once you get over the initial shock (figurative!), you’ll find you can replace many of your device’s outdated components almost as easily as you would change a lightbulb. Below are a few things to keep in mind. I learned this info both while I worked on IT certifications and from (sometimes painful) personal experience. Backup It should go without saying, but even though the old computer you’re working on probably isn’t worth much, you should make sure all your important data is backed up somewhere. I’m not saying there’s a high risk you’re going to blow up your computer, but why risk it? Plan Think everything through before you grab the screwdriver. What exactly will you be doing in computer surgery, doc? I’m talking about the simple stuff you’ll feel stupid for forgetting, like taking a few pictures of how unfamiliar things go together before you touch them, and having a designated spot for screws that is out of the reach of children and elbows. And note what you’re doing as you’re doing it — write it down if you have to. Remember you’re going to have to put everything back! (More on that later.) Do you have the right parts to begin with? Two seemingly identical chargers — one is made for HP netbooks, and the other is made especially for old Dell laptops. Both fit into the circular power port, but guess which one works best with the Dell Latitude D400 pictured? | Robert Patten, EastIdahoNews.com A month ago, I picked up a sweet old Dell laptop from Deseret Industries for $10. (It’s a Latitude D400, which, as far as I can tell, came out around 2003.) My kids use it for homework, and I’m pretty satisfied with the purchase. However, I could not find the charging cable at the store, and the battery didn’t have a charge when I bought it. But I had the brilliant idea of using the cord from my wife’s old HP netbook, and you know what? Nothing fried, and the laptop turned on! Unfortunately, the battery wasn’t charging. I assumed the battery was bad and I would have to get a new one if I wanted the kids to be able to do their homework away from the desk. I nearly spent $30 on a new battery. (Forty dollars for a low-powered homework computer still isn’t horrible, right?) At the last minute, though, my brain kicked in. I thought that it would be best for me to spend $10 on a cord that was actually meant for that model of laptop. When I got the new cable, the battery charged! I could have wasted money on a new battery I didn’t need because I had been using the wrong part (a charger for HP netbooks). Clean out your dust Believe it or not, dust can affect your computer’s performance and ability to cool itself — and it’s gross. While the lid is open, get a can of compressed air and go to town. Just don’t be in the living room when you do it. (Ask my wife how I know.) Static electricity is your enemy Mad scientists often raise their monsters with the help of lightning, but any electricity that is not coming from the power supply is generally a bad idea for a computer. You may know exactly where everything goes, but you can inadvertently fry important parts anyway. I’m pretty sure this happened to me a few years ago. We had just gotten a new desktop computer, and I wanted to see if I could fit it with an extra hard drive I had on hand. (I couldn’t.) I put the case back together, turned the PC on and … it didn’t boot. Just weird error messages. Luckily, the computer was under warranty, and the manufacturer installed a new motherboard for me. I was both stupid and fortunate. I had most likely experienced electrostatic discharge, or ESD. That is, my computer and I had different electrical potential, or different amounts of static electricity. When I touched the motherboard, disaster struck. (You don’t need to worry about ESD if your computer’s case is closed.) You want your electric potential to be the same as your computer’s. Professionals stand on anti-static mats or attach themselves to what they’re repairing with a special wristband, but you may not have those things. A poor man’s way around ESD is to always keeping one’s self in physical contact with the computer case or power supply before conducting repairs and often during the process. You may hear some people tell you the best way to ground a computer is to keep it plugged in. Do you really think working on an appliance that’s attached to the wall is a great idea? More common sense stuff: Don’t conduct your repairs while standing on a shag carpet or drinking from a styrofoam cup (even if it’s out of spilling distance). Oh, and store your electronic components in an anti-static bag. And handle the cards by the edges. All RAM is not created equal Don’t think, “Well, my computer only has half a gigabyte of RAM. I’ll install 10 gigs and give this junker super powers!” The RAM in a Dell Latitude D400. | Robert Patten, EastIdahoNews.com That probably won’t work, as your motherboard can only handle so much memory. When dealing with RAM, the best thing you can do is go online and find your computer’s specs. You could end up wasting your money if you don’t. If you are repairing an older computer, it’s likely an Intel-based 32 bit, also known as x86. (Computers being sold today are usually 64 bit, or x86_64.) A 32-bit motherboard’s theoretical RAM ceiling is 4 gigabytes, but your computer’s limit might actually be less than that. Again, read the specs. Also, your computer will perform best if your memory sticks match. The bottom of a laptop with the important parts labeled. | Robert Patten, EastIdahoNews.com Get the right hard drive This is a question of knowing what connector you have — don’t just buy the first cheap one you see on eBay. Know what will work with your computer. Do you have an ATA, SATA or mini-SATA connection? What size can your computer support? I’ll say it one more time: Read your computer’s specs! This is also a good time to reflect what you want to do. Yes, maybe your computer can support that 1 terabyte drive, but if you’ll primarily be using your computer for web browsing, you may want to set your sights lower. Your wallet will thank you. Another option — and it doesn’t require you to use a screwdriver — is to buy an external hard drive and use the small one inside your computer to host the operating system and a few essential applications only. Don’t fix your old monitor Your computer might have come with a cathode ray tube monitor, or CRT. Until a decade ago, CRTs were the standard. Chances are, you have seen plenty of them: they’re the non-flatscreen kind, the ones that are heavy and bulky. CRT monitors — they look ridiculous, but they can kill you. Unless you have special training, do not attempt to open one. Ever. CRTs carry high charges that could electrocute you, even when they are unplugged. It’s just not worth the risk, even if you have high nostalgia for a certain monitor. Find a cheap monitor at your local thrift store if you have to. It’s a good day when you don’t die. Put everything back Although a naked computer may be a great conversation piece that just happens to be on your coffee table, it isn’t worth it. Yes, leaving the chips and boards exposed increases the risk of damage to the components due to static electricity (see above), a curious child or the stray glass of Dr. Pepper. In addition, you risk overheating your computer. Your computer’s fans suck cool air in and blow hot air out, and your components need to be enclosed for that to work. Be patient with yourself It’s easy to look at all the circuits and chips and feel that you don’t know what you’re doing. And you know what? Unless you’ve got a dual Ph.D in electronics and computer science and have a mad scientist’s intellect, you probably don’t know close to 50 percent of what’s going on under the lid beyond the general overview! I learn something new every time I tinker — the best way to learn is to dive right in. (And if you feel bad about your lack of skills, well … at least you didn’t do this.)

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion Microsoft Event for October 2016 Preview: Schedule, Gadgets, Surface All-in-One, Bluetooth Keyboard and Surface Pro 5 By Neal A. Lasta Oct 11, 2016 | 11:01 AM Microsoft will host an event in October 26, and many believe that lots of new hardware will be introduced on this date; perhaps the next iteration of the Surface Pro, or Surface Book. The event could also be about software, such as new improvements on Windows 10, according to ZDNet. In particular, some rumors suggest the focus of the October 26 Microsoft event is the Windows 10 Redstone 2 update. Microsoft may also introduce 3rd party original equipment manufacturer (OEM) products. Gadgets Surface All-in-One Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit Some rumors say this event will showcase Surface All-in-One system, also known as the Surface Cardinal. According to Windows Central, "Microsoft is developing a new Surface all-in-one (AIO) PC running Windows 10." The Surface AIO is rumored to be a living room device which comes in 3 sizes: 21-inch Full HD, 24-inch 4K and 27-inch 4K. Bluetooth Keyboard According to other rumors, Microsoft may also introduce a new kind of keyboard that has the look and feel of a Surface device. This Bluetooth Keyboard is said to come in gray, with a keyboard layout that is similar to the Designer Bluetooth Desktop Kit. Surface Pro 5 PC Advisor reports the October event may see the release of the Surface Pro 5, which has otherwise been rumored to hit the shelves next year. The Surface Pro 5 is rumored to have an updated Surface Pen. The stylus will now have a rechargeable battery which is so easy to charge; all you need to do is attach it magnetically to the side of the Surface Pro and it will automatically charge. The Surface Pro 5 is also rumored to incorporate an advanced type of Intel Processor. As to the kind of processor it will use, it could be 6th generation Skylake processors, or it could be the new Kaby Lake processors. The Surface Pro 5 will also come in 2K or 4K screens, 16 GM RAM, USB Type-C Ports, and camera upgrades. Aside from the Surface Pro 5, Microsoft might also launch a Surface phone. One thing's for sure though; Microsoft will not introduce a Microsoft Band fitness device this year, according to ZDNet. Schedule So far, Microsoft fans can only speculate about what the company will actually release in the October 26 event. Many predict that just like last year, this fall hardware event will also occur in New York City. A Live stream of the event can be seen here.

Which corporations invest most in the USA? A ranking by the favourite think-tank of the Democratic Party leadership might leave the Party's net roots choking on their muesli. The Progressive Policy Institute has ranked US corporations by the amount they invest in the country, and excluded financial companies from the list. It’s a hot topic, as populists of various flavours have accused US corporations of taking investment (and jobs) offshore. But topping the rankings for domestic investment are companies that the Party’s own net roots love to hate. Two telcos top the list, and three make the top 10. Energy companies, which can be guaranteed to rile most internet slacktivists, also figure prominently. Two companies founded in the PC boom of the 1970s - Apple and Microsoft - make the list at 11th and 14th respectively. The even older Intel makes 18th spot. Google owner Alphabet and Amazon.com are the only “new economy” (as we used to call them in the 1990s) companies to invest in the United States. Alphabet is seventh and Amazon 15th. Yet if you combined the US investment of both companies, making $11bn, it would still only place the joint entity in third place - far behind Verizon ($16.5bn) and AT&T ($18.7bn). What’s interesting is how the political power of the two internet companies far exceeds their domestic capital investment. Telcos and media companies have been left on the sidelines in the Obama administration, as Silicon Valley-friendly officials at agencies bent the rules to favour Big Tech (eg: TV, internet regulation, and music) and turned a deaf ear to competition complaints from smaller internet companies. Building infrastructure costs a lot of money - as Alphabet has found out. Google recently scaled back its Fiber project, touted by the net roots as a “white knight” for US broadband.

X Kevin McGeever may face jail over €1.18m judgment, court warns Former property developer could be imprisoned for contempt of court orders Tue, Oct 11, 2016, 17:16 Updated: Tue, Oct 11, 2016, 17:20 Aodhan O'Faolain Kevin McGeever leaving the Four Courts after he appeared before the High Court on Tuesday. Photograph: Courts Collins         Former property developer Kevin McGeever, who faked his own kidnapping, will avoid being jailed for contempt if he transfers certain shares to a man seeking to recover a €1.18 million judgment against him. Mr McGeever is alleged to have failed to provide a truthful and accurate statement of means in response to efforts by businessman James Byrne to recover a judgment of €1.18 million obtained against Mr McGeever. That alleged failure has resulted in a High Court application to have Mr McGeever jailed for contempt of court orders. The application, which is opposed, has been before the courts on several occasions but adjourned to allow Mr McGeever take certain steps, including to provide information and documents about a property, ‘Nirvana’, in Craughwell Co Galway. When the matter returned before Mr Justice Paul Gilligan at the High Court on Tuesday, he was told by Gary McCarthy SC, for Mr Byrne, his client remains unhappy with Mr McGeever’s attempts to progress matters, in particular, to provide full details about Nirvana. Mr McGeever had claimed the house is owned by a Belize registered company, Universal Assets Ltd, and is held in trust for his two daughters. Mr Justice Gilligan, noting Mr Byrne’s judgment remains unsatisfied, said the court “would not stand idly by” while court orders were “not being complied with”. He adjourned the matter for another two weeks to allow Mr McGeever take certain steps, including to transfer shares in Universal Assets to Mr Byrne. If those steps were taken, the application to have Mr McGeever jailed for contempt would not proceed, he said. Séamas Ó Tuathail AS, for Mr McGeever, said his client was prepared to given an undertaking the property would not be sold in the meantime. Mr Byrne had obtained judgment against Mr McGeever and his company over a failed deal to purchase several apartments in Dubai sold by Mr McGeever’s KMM Intel Properties. ADVERTISEMENT As part of Mr Byrne’s attempts to recover the monies, Mr McGeever, with an address at Clontarf, Dublin 3, was cross examined before the Master of the High Court about his sworn statement of affairs. It is claimed Mr McGeever did not set out his property interests in the statement as he was required to do, including an alleged interest in Nirvana . It is also alleged Mr McGeever perjured himself in his sworn statement. Mr Byrne claims his efforts to recover the monies have been seriously impaired by Mr McGeever’s failure to provide a full and frank statement of affairs. Last April, Mr McGeever pleaded guilty before Galway Circuit Court for wasting Garda time. He had claimed he was kidnapped by creditors who held him for eight months before he turned up on a roadside and was picked up by a passing motorist. He received a two year suspended sentence.       Topics: James Byrne Justice Paul Gilligan Kevin McGeever Seamas O Tuathail Garda Síochána High Court Belize Clontarf Dubai Dublin(IE) Read More Man ‘swindled’ by Kevin McGeever seeks to recover €1.18m Kevin McGeever denies buying mansion with proceeds of crime Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Politics Public service to return to its ‘peak’ size next year Opinion Kathy Sheridan: What can liberals learn from the US election?

That 2016 variant is set to introduce the biggest set of changes yet to the MacBook Pro, but details are still largely thin on the ground. In this article, we’ll round up all the rumors and speculation about the MacBook Pro 2016. OLED Touchbar As aforementioned, the new MacBook Pro is set to bring with it a number of big changes, including most notably in the design department. According to the Week, there’s been one consistent feature rumored to be heading to the new MacBook Pro; an OLED touch bar. The MacBook Pro is widely perceived as having one of the best laptop keyboards on the market, but Apple could be about to improve on that even further. Recent leaks suggest that Apple plans to place a touch-sensitive strip above the keyboard, which would completely replace the function keys. The laptop will then be able to change that OLED display depending on what the user is doing. For instance, the bar could be used to track downloads or control music playback. The rumor is a pretty concrete one too, with Ming-Chi Kuo, one of the most accurate Apple analysts, saying the new OLED touch bar will represent one of the most significant and ambitious upgrades made by Apple. MacBook Pro 2016 Will Be The Most Colorful And Thinnest Apple Laptop Ever Madehttps://t.co/Msk4JK8yXD pic.twitter.com/tHhumg1pxS — iTechPost (@iTechPost) October 10, 2016 Thinner Design According to Gotta Be Mobile, the design of the MacBook Pro 2016 will generally be improved upon over recent models, which have followed a fairly similar design pattern. Ming-Chi Kuo has already said that he expects to see a thinner and more compact design with the new MacBook Pro, closer to that of the current standard MacBook and MacBook Air models. However, that could also mean replacing the MagSafe 2 charging port and other ports with standard USB connectivity — which Apple appears to be picking up with their laptops of late. That said, Apple is expected to keep their display variants the same. The new 2016 MacBook Pro is expected to be available in both a 13-inch and 15-inch variant, just as with previous models. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D0kMsWkq6hc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> RELATED STORIES ON INQUISITR: New iMac 2016 Update Rumors: Release Date And Specs For Apple’s Latest All-In-One No Apple Watch 2 For U.K. Politicians: British PM Theresa May Bans Smartwatches From Cabinet Meetings New MacBook Air: What’s Next For Apple’s 13 Inch Laptop? 2017 Model Release Date, Specs And More More Power and Battery Life Whilst Apple appears to be placing a large emphasis on the external design of its upcoming MacBook Pro, that doesn’t mean they plan on neglecting what’s on the inside. Analysts are optimistic that Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pro will provide more power and better battery life. It’s now pretty much a given that Apple will take advantage of Intel’s new sixth-generation Skylake processors with the 2016 MacBook Pro, which should provide a significant power boost. Those new Skylake processors would also allow for much better battery life. It’s also worth noting that Intel’s latest processors also allow for wireless charging, but Apple isn’t likely to take advantage of this. https://t.co/LjP669CKgP : #MacBookPro #Laptop – Macbook Pro 2016 Release Date, News & Update: Apple Looking to D … pic.twitter.com/uCT9a3jQbl — TREND GIZMO (@TrendGizmo) October 4, 2016 Announcement and Release So when will we know more about the new MacBook Pro? Apple is expected to hold its final keynote event of the year in the coming weeks. The company typically dedicates its third keynote to the Mac line of products, with this year’s event expected to feature a new MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, iMac and Mac Mini. As it stands, the company is expected to have MacOS ready to utilize that aforementioned OLED touch bar by the end of October, suggesting that the company plans to have the new laptop on shelves by next month.

Is another operating system what consumers need? Many people think so. https://t.co/GFPr02ruE7 — Ali Zartash-Lloyd (@Cognisant2000) October 7, 2016 Andromeda reportedly is a mashup of Android and Chrome, with features from Chrome having been ported into Android rather than the other way around. It's expected to show up next year in a new laptop, dubbed "Pixel 3," Android Police reported last month. The project is known internally as "Bison." Putting It Together Andromeda apparently is distinct from Google's current bid to bring Android apps to Chromebooks through the App Runtime for Chrome project, and the Pixel 3 won't be marketed as a Chromebook. Google also plans to launch a Huawei-manufactured Nexus tablet that will run Andromeda, 9to5 Google reported last month. A Chrome and Android mashup would provide "a common platform across all devices that includes not only the OS but the browser functions as well," observed Michael Jude, a program manager at Stratecast/Frost & Sullivan. "It's what Microsoft was trying to do before the government told them they couldn't," he told TechNewsWorld. Reaching for Andromeda Google has been "on a trajectory to hybridize Android and Chrome OS in terms of running apps, the Web/Touch model and other aspects," noted Al Hilwa, a research program director at IDC. "I'm not surprised to see Andromeda devices," he told TechNewsWorld. This move "is essentially what we've said all along Google should do," Hilwa remarked. "Clearly they can only do it at a certain pace, given that these are established platforms with OEM ecosystems." The pace has been fairly sedate for Google. Executive chairman Eric Schmidt appeared to hint at the hybridization in his keynote at the 2011 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Chrome and Android would have more features in common, Schmidt said two years later, though Google intended to keep the OSes separate. Those comments followed Android guru Andy Rubin's move from the Android unit to head unspecified new projects. Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who was then head of the Chrome OS unit, was Rubin's replacement. That move increased speculation that Google was planning an eventual merger of the two OSes. Hardware Expectations Andromeda "will optimize access to Google Assistant from hybrid PCs and tablets," suggested Werner Goertz, a research director at Gartner. However, Google's new Allo chat app and its new Pixel hardware devices will be more relevant, he told TechNewsWorld ahead of last week's event, as they're integrated with Google Assistant. They "will form the starting point for a new ecosystem for Google's virtual personal assistant," Goertz noted. "As such, Google's strategy resembles that of Amazon with Alexa." The Pixel 3, slated for release next year, will be an ultra-thin laptop with a 12.3-inch display, Android Police reported. It's expected to have a tablet mode, but whether it will be a 2-in-1 device like Microsoft's Surface Book or have some other form factor is unknown. It will have an Intel M3 or i5 Core processor with 32 or 128 GB of storage and 8 GB or 16 GB of RAM, according to Android Police. It also will have a fingerprint scanner, two USB C ports, a 3.5 mm jack, stylus support, stereo speakers, quad mikes, and a backlit keyboard with a glass trackpad employing haptic tech and force detection. Battery life is expected to be about 10 hours. Richard Adhikari has written about high-tech for leading industry publications since the 1990s and wonders where it's all leading to.

We'll see grave environmental damage instead of progress. Fear of negative consequences will spur more positive actions. Trump probably will come around to a more moderate position. We won't see much change either way in just four years. Trump will expose the climate change hoax -- and it's about time.
